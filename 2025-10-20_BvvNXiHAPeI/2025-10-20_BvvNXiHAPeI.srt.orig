1
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:57,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everyone.

2
00:41:00,315 --> 00:41:07,816
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on time tonight from our executive session so yes, we're rolling.

3
00:41:07,956 --> 00:41:08,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

4
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:23,579
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our consent agenda approval of bills and payrolls approval capital purchases approval of donations sound equipment worth 7500 from the McGlynn school organized by caregivers approval of grants.

5
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:34,943
[SPEAKER_05]: American Academy of Pediatrics 2500 micro grant for bio directional communication processes, approval field trips and approval of the meeting minutes for October 6 2025.

6
00:41:35,803 --> 00:41:39,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion for approval of the consent agenda?

7
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:41,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, member Reinfeld.

8
00:41:41,904 --> 00:41:48,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just, what is bi-directional communication between healthcare providers and the nurses?

9
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:49,346
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that look like?

10
00:41:54,165 --> 00:41:54,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this?

11
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:04,627
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds great and I think I'm excited about it, but I would just like to know what it entails.

12
00:42:05,387 --> 00:42:05,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there was.

13
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:06,987
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.

14
00:42:07,968 --> 00:42:09,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I love bidirectional communication.

15
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:15,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to put on the spot, but yeah, we have we have them.

16
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:20,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Miss Silva, are you available to give us a little more detail than?

17
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,060
[SPEAKER_05]: The one page that we have in our packet?

18
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:25,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, can you hear me?

19
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:27,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

20
00:42:28,164 --> 00:42:28,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

21
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:36,411
[SPEAKER_06]: So, bi-directional communication is really looking at the two-way communication process between health care providers in the community and the nurses.

22
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:38,613
[SPEAKER_06]: So, things like when we do release of information.

23
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:45,860
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I can't just pick up a phone and call a doctor and ask them to give me information about a child that, you know, parents have to sign consent.

24
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,817
[SPEAKER_06]: for us to share that information.

25
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:55,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So the purpose of this grant is to come up with systems and processes to make that a smoother application across the board.

26
00:42:55,147 --> 00:42:57,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

27
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much and thanks for signing on.

28
00:42:58,972 --> 00:43:00,615
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll motion to approve the consent agenda.

29
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:02,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

30
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:04,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Graham.

31
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:05,447
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

32
00:43:05,927 --> 00:43:06,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

33
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,028
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

34
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:08,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Consent agenda is approved.

35
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:14,537
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have any reports of subcommittees, and we do have reports of our superintendent.

36
00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:16,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So first up, our Mustang moment.

37
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:17,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, everybody.

38
00:43:23,374 --> 00:43:28,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we're gonna have Principal Tucci and Director Cieri come.

39
00:43:28,376 --> 00:43:41,542
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to frame a little bit for the Mustang moment for our two students that are here, share some exciting news and just frame a little bit as to what our middle school students are going to be sharing with us this evening.

40
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:42,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

41
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:48,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Mayor Longo Kern, members of the school committee, Dr. Galussi and members of our school committee.

42
00:43:49,635 --> 00:44:00,463
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited to be here to introduce two of our incredible students who are here to share some of their experiences in their science challenge class, participating in our newest STEM initiative at the middle school level, Robotics 360.

43
00:44:02,184 --> 00:44:09,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Robotics 360 is a robotics program designed to embed real world problem solving and 21st century skills across our curriculum.

44
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:17,616
[SPEAKER_12]: What makes this program stand out is this intentional blend of creativity, collaboration, and technical learning.

45
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:22,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Students are just building robots in this course, they're engineering solutions.

46
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:31,613
[SPEAKER_12]: They work in teams to tackle authentic challenges, and as they design, build, and test their robots, they're also learning coding.

47
00:44:33,074 --> 00:44:38,037
[SPEAKER_12]: In the classroom environment, the students are really excited, they're super engaged, and they're motivated.

48
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:44,620
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not just learning about robotics, they're learning how to think, how to iterate, and how to persist through some academic struggle.

49
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:51,547
[SPEAKER_12]: These are exactly the kind of grade level tasks that we aim to engage our middle school learners in.

50
00:44:52,287 --> 00:44:54,408
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll turn it over to Mr. Cieri for a few words as well.

51
00:44:56,629 --> 00:45:00,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Mayor, Longo Kern, school committee members and superintendent.

52
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:10,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Like my colleague, Mr. Tucci, I am thrilled to introduce this new STEM program, the initiative at our middle school.

53
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:14,236
[SPEAKER_11]: My remarks this evening will be brief.

54
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:22,525
[SPEAKER_11]: The one thing I want to emphasize that Robotics 360 is not Lego robotics.

55
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:29,069
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a comprehensive K-12 educational solution in STEM that uses robotics.

56
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:35,452
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the components at the middle school is using a robot system called Lego spike.

57
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:41,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And that encourages the students to try to engage in these real world problems.

58
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:48,054
[SPEAKER_11]: The coding environment uses block-based programming, essentially Scratch.

59
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:56,161
[SPEAKER_11]: But they can easily toggle between the block-based programming and a screen that allows programming in Python.

60
00:45:56,842 --> 00:46:02,287
[SPEAKER_11]: So they can see the block programming, and they can toggle to the Python programming.

61
00:46:02,687 --> 00:46:05,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And they can code in each, and they can code the robots.

62
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,831
[SPEAKER_11]: This versatility is unique to Robotics 360.

63
00:46:11,451 --> 00:46:22,955
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition, as the students move in the program from kindergarten through high school, if they choose, if you have the entire program, the robots in the curriculum changes.

64
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,897
[SPEAKER_11]: The curriculum challenges change.

65
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:36,120
[SPEAKER_11]: The lessons change to meet the level of the students, and it leaves us the option and the opportunity to expand in the future in both directions.

66
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:41,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Importantly, the platform and the programming language never change.

67
00:46:42,222 --> 00:46:50,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Therefore, as students learn programming with different robots, they don't need to learn a brand new programming language each step of the way.

68
00:46:51,365 --> 00:46:59,727
[SPEAKER_11]: This ensures that they're developing a true working knowledge of programming rather than relearning all the different languages in which to code.

69
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:05,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Much of what you'll hear this evening is the student experience.

70
00:47:06,768 --> 00:47:10,273
[SPEAKER_11]: And based on what I've seen and heard, the program is successful.

71
00:47:10,753 --> 00:47:17,582
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only been a couple of months, but both the students and the teachers are excited to engage in their science challenge course.

72
00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:30,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Robotics 360 continues to support our analysis of learning with a fine-grained quantitative data collection on the student learning as they program their robots and go through the different modules.

73
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:38,613
[SPEAKER_11]: And it dynamically deploys lessons to the students so that they move at the pace that matches their own success in the classroom.

74
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:45,095
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to turn it back to Mr. Tucci to introduce the students from the McGlynn.

75
00:47:45,755 --> 00:47:47,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thank you this evening for listening to us.

76
00:47:48,801 --> 00:47:54,682
[SPEAKER_12]: So tonight I'm proud to introduce two fantastic students who have been part of the pilot launch here of Robotics 360.

77
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:59,443
[SPEAKER_12]: They have spent the first quarter of their academic school year engaged in the Science Challenge class.

78
00:48:00,124 --> 00:48:03,724
[SPEAKER_12]: And today they're going to be speaking from the heart, sharing their student experience.

79
00:48:04,204 --> 00:48:08,165
[SPEAKER_12]: So please join me in welcoming eighth grade student, A.B.

80
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:13,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Annabelle Foster, and sixth grade student, Oliver Ndoyeske-Santos.

81
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:15,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll first welcome Annabelle to the stage.

82
00:48:20,253 --> 00:48:23,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, my name is Annabelle Foster and I'm an eighth grader at the McGlynn Middle School.

83
00:48:24,795 --> 00:48:29,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Each quarter we have the opportunity with a new middle school schedule to partake in a challenge class.

84
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:35,399
[SPEAKER_02]: My first quarter challenge class is the science challenge where we have the opportunity to engage in building and coding robots.

85
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to provide a brief overview of the science challenge.

86
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:44,443
[SPEAKER_02]: The course consists of a kit with modified Legos for building and an online program for coding.

87
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:51,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only do we learn the mechanics of an actual robot, but we also learn to code using block coding, which is the base for all coding in the future.

88
00:48:52,589 --> 00:48:55,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Thus far this quarter, my group members and I have progressed to Unit 4.

89
00:48:56,832 --> 00:49:06,660
[SPEAKER_02]: We have currently been tasked with building a crab-like robot, which is designed to take information from underwater, scan for ocean temperature, and gather data points that can be useful in helping research aquatic life in the future.

90
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:15,050
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to teaching coding, it also encourages us to work collaboratively and identify and share our personal abilities to better the whole group.

91
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:20,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Both coding and team building have real world applications that are often lacking in other subjects.

92
00:49:21,034 --> 00:49:24,356
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that we as students most often ask is how can we use this in the real world?

93
00:49:25,036 --> 00:49:28,218
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we use the Pythagorean theorem to earn an income or pay taxes?

94
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:31,900
[SPEAKER_02]: This program has many real world applications.

95
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:37,063
[SPEAKER_02]: There are team building aspects of the program as well as learning how to follow your strengths and weaknesses and contribute to the group.

96
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:46,738
[SPEAKER_02]: The challenge classes offer an in-depth exposure to the other subjects in a way that changes people's perspectives on certain areas that may not be their favorite.

97
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,400
[SPEAKER_02]: The science challenge requires coding in a group.

98
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:53,064
[SPEAKER_02]: This means we have to divide tasks in the group and come up with a cohesive plan.

99
00:49:53,945 --> 00:49:58,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I have no intention of becoming a coder, the program and science challenge has multiple applications.

100
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:08,779
[SPEAKER_02]: It obviously teaches you to code, but it also helps people work together, understand their own personal strengths, and allows them to contribute in a unique and meaningful way.

101
00:50:09,379 --> 00:50:11,060
[SPEAKER_02]: The group learns how to split up responsibilities.

102
00:50:12,001 --> 00:50:14,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I aspire to one day work in the medical field, specifically surgery.

103
00:50:16,003 --> 00:50:21,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Engaging in tasks like this better prepares me to develop the skills needed to support me in accomplishing my goals.

104
00:50:22,005 --> 00:50:28,667
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically the collaborative aspects that this course has provided me with, and challenged me to persist when engaging with meaningful scientific tasks.

105
00:50:29,387 --> 00:50:33,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for taking your time to listen to my experiences thus far this year, and I'm happy to answer any of your questions.

106
00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:43,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Next up to the podium is Oliver Doyeski-Santos, grade six.

107
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:49,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

108
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:50,955
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Ollie.

109
00:50:51,055 --> 00:50:52,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the sixth grade at McGlynn Middle School.

110
00:50:53,197 --> 00:50:55,158
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first year in the Medford Public Schools.

111
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:04,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Someday I hope to work for NASA and I'm excited that in sixth grade we are already learning to code and make robots, which is a skill I can use in the future to help me pursue my goals.

112
00:51:06,048 --> 00:51:08,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned about coding for the first time in fourth grade.

113
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I didn't really take much out of it because there's too many kids in the class.

114
00:51:11,994 --> 00:51:16,438
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, during my science challenge class, I've had the opportunity to engage in this work.

115
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:24,827
[SPEAKER_00]: In science challenge class, we are challenged with working together to code and build robots using our Chromebooks and Legos.

116
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:30,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with my team this year has been really fun because we all have different ways we want to use the robot.

117
00:51:30,912 --> 00:51:36,096
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, some of my group members want to build a dog robot and another group of penguin robots.

118
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:44,944
[SPEAKER_00]: As a group, we have to make decisions on how to build different features and add-ons to enhance the robot's ability to function.

119
00:51:45,565 --> 00:51:52,711
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we added wheels and feet to our robot to help us better understand which features would help the robot move more effectively and efficiently.

120
00:51:53,591 --> 00:52:00,714
[SPEAKER_00]: In this class, I feel sort of like an engineer because we will run into difficult situations or roadblocks and we have to fix different problems that come up.

121
00:52:01,594 --> 00:52:07,196
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll fix these problems by experimenting and speaking with other groups in the class in order to fix the problems.

122
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:13,998
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives us a sense of accomplishment when we overcome these challenges.

123
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:19,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate working with robots in the school and I can't wait to use my coding skills in the future.

124
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

125
00:52:29,158 --> 00:52:29,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ntapa.

126
00:52:34,286 --> 00:52:34,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

127
00:52:34,627 --> 00:52:38,833
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to say thank you both for coming and talking about your experience through this program.

128
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:50,464
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, these initiatives, I was in, you know, sort of something like this when I was in elementary school and then it was just, you know, Lego Mindstorms and to see it evolve into something this great in the middle school level is absolutely amazing.

129
00:52:50,484 --> 00:53:01,952
[SPEAKER_15]: And well, you said it yourself about how, you know, even if you don't go end up, don't end up going on to be a coder, you know, there's so many world life and real life applications that this has, you know, it's a different way of thinking.

130
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,253
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a different sense of logic.

131
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:06,655
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a different way to interpret data and situations.

132
00:53:06,735 --> 00:53:08,417
[SPEAKER_15]: So even if it's not coding,

133
00:53:09,037 --> 00:53:13,020
[SPEAKER_15]: it's still helping you develop as an individual and navigate through the school system.

134
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,302
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's giving you that hands-on experience to do that, and that's great.

135
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,744
[SPEAKER_15]: And Ali, you said the same thing.

136
00:53:18,784 --> 00:53:28,671
[SPEAKER_15]: And Ali, I just want to say the last person that went through the Medford public school system that I heard said they wanted to work for NASA ended up being the youngest person on the black hole photo team.

137
00:53:28,912 --> 00:53:31,834
[SPEAKER_15]: So keep that dream big, because you might be someone like that.

138
00:53:32,594 --> 00:53:33,075
[SPEAKER_15]: You probably will.

139
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:39,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

140
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:43,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

141
00:53:43,506 --> 00:53:44,346
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't think I was next.

142
00:53:44,406 --> 00:53:44,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

143
00:53:45,547 --> 00:53:51,912
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm a Python programmer and I will say that, and I work at Dana Farber Cancer Institute and

144
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:55,179
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people use it who are not coders.

145
00:53:55,779 --> 00:54:07,904
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that that is a skill that you will have a huge advantage over in any field if you can do your own coding to solve certain problems rather than farming it out to someone else.

146
00:54:07,984 --> 00:54:13,206
[SPEAKER_13]: So don't just assume because you don't want to be a coder that that's not your future.

147
00:54:13,226 --> 00:54:18,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Because being able to do it will be very helpful, even if it's not your day-to-day job.

148
00:54:18,448 --> 00:54:20,409
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is exciting.

149
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:21,830
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish we had this when I was a kid.

150
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:23,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

151
00:54:24,487 --> 00:54:24,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

152
00:54:24,847 --> 00:54:29,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I know member Graham, and then we'll turn it over to our student rep.

153
00:54:30,712 --> 00:54:31,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

154
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:50,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for putting this into the rotation, because when we worked through all of the schedule changes and the concept of a challenge class came up, there were just lots of questions, understandably, about what it was going to be and what it was going to look like.

155
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:57,349
[SPEAKER_16]: And change is really hard to wrap your mind around when you've never done that thing before, or you don't have any sort of frame of reference.

156
00:54:57,429 --> 00:55:09,793
[SPEAKER_16]: So I am super happy to hear about what in practice is happening, because I think that is the excitement that middle school has been missing.

157
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:34,165
[SPEAKER_16]: in my opinion, having two kids that are no longer in middle school, they come home and they talk about their classes and exciting things that happen in them, but this seems like something just special for the middle school to really think about and start to embrace all these aspects of project-based learning that we talk to in a way that's reserved for CCSR.

158
00:55:34,386 --> 00:55:36,587
[SPEAKER_16]: And project-based learning is not

159
00:55:37,227 --> 00:55:40,770
[SPEAKER_16]: reserved for something that you have time to do after school.

160
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:43,392
[SPEAKER_16]: It should be part of what you're doing every single day.

161
00:55:43,492 --> 00:55:48,036
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm just like so excited to hear you say, we're learning how to work in a team because guess what?

162
00:55:48,076 --> 00:55:49,437
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what you're gonna do forever.

163
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:52,919
[SPEAKER_16]: So all of that is great.

164
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,763
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you both for coming tonight and telling us about your classes.

165
00:55:56,843 --> 00:56:00,365
[SPEAKER_16]: It's super helpful to see these things in action.

166
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:03,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Graham.

167
00:56:08,513 --> 00:56:34,452
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to say, as a member of the Medford High School Robotics and Engineering Shop and our underwater design program, Sunk Robotics, I just want to say that it's so enlightening to hear that there's this sort of pathway that's been established in that regard, and we'd love to see you there in a year or in four years or something, because it really sounds like you're laying a foundation for success in that regard.

168
00:56:35,939 --> 00:56:42,423
[SPEAKER_18]: If you ever need any help or want to get a head start, shoot us an email and we can definitely help you.

169
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:43,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

170
00:56:44,824 --> 00:56:45,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

171
00:56:45,225 --> 00:56:46,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeldt.

172
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:51,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I echo the thanks for sharing.

173
00:56:51,068 --> 00:56:57,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of advice about what we could do in the future to prepare you to

174
00:56:59,152 --> 00:57:06,574
[SPEAKER_08]: take this on and where you would hope to go next with this, not you personally, but in terms of what happens in the next step of classrooms?

175
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:09,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Either one of you?

176
00:57:11,034 --> 00:57:11,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to put you on the spot.

177
00:57:12,835 --> 00:57:14,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so what could we have done?

178
00:57:14,655 --> 00:57:15,335
[SPEAKER_08]: No, of course.

179
00:57:16,156 --> 00:57:24,997
[SPEAKER_08]: What could Medford Public Schools have done to prepare you to take on these challenges and where would you like them to go next?

180
00:57:28,591 --> 00:57:34,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's not a lot that Medford Public Schools could have done to prepare us because obviously the schedule change is new.

181
00:57:36,698 --> 00:57:49,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like if in the future we could have like a solidified, obviously there are a few kinks to work out because this program has been, we're like the second school in America to use this program.

182
00:57:49,749 --> 00:57:54,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are obviously a couple of kinks, including, I think just working them out.

183
00:57:56,425 --> 00:58:01,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sometimes a word or two is mistranslated and it doesn't make any sense.

184
00:58:02,569 --> 00:58:06,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Or sometimes a code doesn't let you pass and it doesn't tell you why.

185
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:18,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So once all these small minor issues are figured out, I think that would be the next step in these programs in the future, if that makes sense.

186
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:18,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

187
00:58:19,722 --> 00:58:20,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

188
00:58:20,022 --> 00:58:20,702
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really helpful.

189
00:58:21,183 --> 00:58:21,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

190
00:58:22,284 --> 00:58:40,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so I would say like there's not really much because like it's a new program but like like kind of like what you said like there's like a couple times where like a code doesn't let you pass but like you did everything right so yeah I feel like just once they're kind of like fixed and it's like perfect.

191
00:58:41,526 --> 00:58:43,128
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked having the class.

192
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:44,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

193
00:58:44,068 --> 00:58:44,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so glad to hear that.

194
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:50,372
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope you'll make sure to tell your teachers what we can be doing to better support you.

195
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:51,172
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

196
00:58:51,493 --> 00:58:51,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

197
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:57,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And before I pass it over to Dr. Galussi, I just want to say thank you, Dr. Galussi, for adding the Mustang moment.

198
00:58:57,736 --> 00:59:01,819
[SPEAKER_05]: It's these presentations that are a great way to start off our meeting.

199
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And both of you, your parents should be very impressed.

200
00:59:05,061 --> 00:59:06,341
[SPEAKER_05]: You did an amazing job.

201
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:09,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ollie, my son's in sixth grade at the McGlynn too.

202
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:12,025
[SPEAKER_05]: You could maybe bring him along with you.

203
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:16,411
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find him in Mr. Bruno's office once in a while.

204
00:59:19,273 --> 00:59:21,996
[SPEAKER_05]: But with all joking aside, fabulous job.

205
00:59:22,036 --> 00:59:27,140
[SPEAKER_05]: You seem like you're in college presenting as young adults, so amazing job.

206
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:28,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Lucy.

207
00:59:30,503 --> 00:59:31,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

208
00:59:31,204 --> 00:59:34,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say thank you to our student representatives.

209
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:36,189
[SPEAKER_04]: You did an excellent job.

210
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:46,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Your writing allowed us to really understand and get a sense as to what the classes are like for you, some of the things you're learning, some of the skills you're gonna take with you.

211
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,039
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole point of Mustang Moment.

212
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:53,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's to give the community a little snapshot into the lives of students.

213
00:59:54,082 --> 00:59:58,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I really appreciate the courage it took to come here and present to us.

214
00:59:59,246 --> 01:00:03,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I also wanna thank Principal Tucci and Director Cieri

215
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:13,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Seery had this wonderful opportunity to work with Robotics 360 and he just was very proactive and jumped right on it.

216
01:00:14,033 --> 01:00:19,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you can see the benefit in just the short amount of time that it has had for our community.

217
01:00:20,436 --> 01:00:24,077
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have seen in the Friday memo, I'm surprised they kind of buried the lead here.

218
01:00:25,778 --> 01:00:38,429
[SPEAKER_04]: But so much so that the Lieutenant Governor and the Secretary of Education, so Driscoll and Dr. Tutwiler are coming on Thursday to see this in action.

219
01:00:39,149 --> 01:00:48,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they will be at the McGlynn School going to a science challenge class to see Robotics 360 in real time.

220
01:00:48,957 --> 01:00:51,840
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're honored and privileged to be having

221
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:57,622
[SPEAKER_04]: the Lieutenant Governor and the Secretary of Education doing the program.

222
01:00:58,343 --> 01:01:02,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you very much for your hard work with this as well as Principal Skane.

223
01:01:03,825 --> 01:01:11,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of hours of collaboration have gone into making sure that this went off in benefit of our students.

224
01:01:11,749 --> 01:01:13,549
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

225
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:17,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

226
01:01:17,731 --> 01:01:19,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, picture.

227
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:44,050
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

228
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,291
[SPEAKER_07]: You're probably.

229
01:02:11,647 --> 01:02:12,052
[SPEAKER_07]: next time.

230
01:03:15,685 --> 01:03:16,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

231
01:03:16,105 --> 01:03:20,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Cieri, good luck with the rest of the soccer season.

232
01:03:20,349 --> 01:03:21,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard you had a tough one.

233
01:03:22,572 --> 01:03:26,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

234
01:03:26,894 --> 01:03:29,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, next up we have our facilities condition assessment report.

235
01:03:30,016 --> 01:03:37,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to invite up Mr. Kenneth Lord, Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Kevin Proventure.

236
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I say that wrong?

237
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:41,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it?

238
01:03:42,982 --> 01:03:45,423
[SPEAKER_05]: President Habib and Associates Architects.

239
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

240
01:03:46,043 --> 01:03:49,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

241
01:03:52,752 --> 01:04:00,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, good evening to the mayor, the interim superintendent and members of the school committee.

242
01:04:00,195 --> 01:04:01,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for having me.

243
01:04:01,736 --> 01:04:02,896
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Kevin Provencher.

244
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:06,238
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm an architect and president of Habib and Associates Architects.

245
01:04:07,418 --> 01:04:13,361
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been working with public schools in Massachusetts for the past 27 years.

246
01:04:14,082 --> 01:04:30,530
[SPEAKER_14]: And this year we were asked by Medford Public Schools to prepare a facilities condition assessment for the five elementary and middle schools, Brooks, Missittuc, Roberts, Andrews and McGlynn.

247
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:34,292
[SPEAKER_14]: We've prepared a great many of these.

248
01:04:35,473 --> 01:04:42,680
[SPEAKER_14]: And the districts that we've worked with have found them to be an extremely useful capital planning tool.

249
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,524
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm hoping that you'll find the same results here tonight.

250
01:04:47,545 --> 01:04:53,811
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've had a chance to review the full report, and I understand that you haven't had it for very long,

251
01:04:54,645 --> 01:05:00,547
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's a great deal of detail in there we won't be able to get to that depth tonight.

252
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:14,473
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to try to give you an overview of the process, how we work, how we collect the information, and how we arrive at some of the conclusions that I think will be helpful.

253
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:22,771
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a great number of people that are involved in putting one of these things together.

254
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:31,399
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think the most successful results are always when we get a high level of participation from the school department.

255
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:32,680
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was the case here.

256
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:40,308
[SPEAKER_14]: All of the school principals and the custodial staff, in addition to the facility staff,

257
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:45,418
[SPEAKER_14]: All participated, and it's a very important part of the process.

258
01:05:45,879 --> 01:05:53,750
[SPEAKER_14]: If we don't have access to these people, there's a lot of information that we simply just can't collect.

259
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,613
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we're very grateful for that.

260
01:05:58,585 --> 01:06:04,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Our team consisted of myself as the project manager and my coworkers.

261
01:06:04,689 --> 01:06:19,197
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also had a team of consulting engineers from GGD who joined us on our tours and evaluated the mechanical, electrical and the fire protection systems as well.

262
01:06:19,257 --> 01:06:21,619
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a good deal of expertise on the team.

263
01:06:24,656 --> 01:06:30,899
[SPEAKER_14]: So just a little bit about the process and the purpose or the why we do this.

264
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:37,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Very simply put, we describe the current conditions that we observe at the schools.

265
01:06:39,642 --> 01:06:57,438
[SPEAKER_14]: And taking those observations, we set priorities and make recommendations of things that we think need to be addressed, things that need to be repaired, replaced, and then we provide budget estimates for those items.

266
01:06:58,779 --> 01:07:05,405
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I mentioned earlier, those cost estimate supports the development of the capital plan.

267
01:07:09,304 --> 01:07:27,314
[SPEAKER_14]: So the scope of the process, we start with reviewing the concerns with the facilities staff, including the chief operations officer, the director of the buildings and grounds, John McLaughlin, and the head custodians that I mentioned a bit earlier.

268
01:07:28,175 --> 01:07:33,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Principals also provide us with some good detail of things that they want us to know.

269
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:41,642
[SPEAKER_14]: We tour all of the schools and we visit as many of the interior spaces as we can.

270
01:07:42,702 --> 01:07:47,484
[SPEAKER_14]: That took place over the February break when students were not in the building.

271
01:07:47,544 --> 01:07:53,545
[SPEAKER_14]: So it gives us a lot of access that we can't get at any other time of the year.

272
01:07:54,206 --> 01:08:02,988
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't open every locked door, look in every closet or under every rug, but it's really more of a high level overview of what we see.

273
01:08:04,787 --> 01:08:11,152
[SPEAKER_14]: We identify the deficiencies in the materials and the systems that we would recommend for repair or replacement.

274
01:08:12,343 --> 01:08:23,906
[SPEAKER_14]: We prepare work items for each of those observations, and we assign each of those a priority, which I'll talk about in a little bit more detail in a few minutes.

275
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:36,130
[SPEAKER_14]: We estimate the quantities involved, and we assigned unit costs to those quantities, which help us to calculate the total cost per each work item.

276
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:39,773
[SPEAKER_14]: And that includes soft costs and escalation.

277
01:08:40,294 --> 01:08:43,638
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll explain what that part means in a later slide.

278
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:56,425
[SPEAKER_14]: So in summary, the method, the assessment is based on our visual inspection and our observations of what we can see.

279
01:08:58,066 --> 01:09:01,668
[SPEAKER_14]: We rely on those interviews that I mentioned.

280
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:06,051
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have access to the original construction drawings.

281
01:09:06,911 --> 01:09:11,394
[SPEAKER_14]: These schools are relatively new compared to other schools in the Commonwealth.

282
01:09:12,505 --> 01:09:17,288
[SPEAKER_14]: And all of those construction drawings were available to us, which provide us with a lot of detail.

283
01:09:18,929 --> 01:09:22,211
[SPEAKER_14]: We review the buildings and the systems in their entirety.

284
01:09:22,511 --> 01:09:40,681
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, we identify those deficiencies and they're typically deficiencies that are related to the age of the building or the useful life, things that should be considered for replacement for lifecycle costing and 21st century learning practices.

285
01:09:44,487 --> 01:09:49,029
[SPEAKER_14]: So each of the work items, we assign a priority.

286
01:09:49,069 --> 01:09:51,551
[SPEAKER_14]: We call them scope categories.

287
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:57,774
[SPEAKER_14]: And so for this assessment, we had three scopes in order of priority.

288
01:09:58,314 --> 01:10:06,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Scope number one are items that are necessary but not yet critical.

289
01:10:06,558 --> 01:10:08,059
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I mean by that is

290
01:10:08,874 --> 01:10:19,782
[SPEAKER_14]: If you had a critical item that needs to be addressed, you would have addressed it already because that's something that's, you know, it's an emergency or something that has to be addressed immediately.

291
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:24,786
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't see any of that in our assessment, which is good.

292
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:29,150
[SPEAKER_14]: But these are items that will deteriorate predictably.

293
01:10:30,491 --> 01:10:36,718
[SPEAKER_14]: and could involve some downtime if things needed to be shut down to make a repair.

294
01:10:37,839 --> 01:10:45,929
[SPEAKER_14]: And these are things that will continue to deteriorate over time and become more and more expensive to address if deferred.

295
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,692
[SPEAKER_14]: The second scope category

296
01:10:49,742 --> 01:11:12,290
[SPEAKER_14]: are the things that we recommend, and these are things that are needed immediately, but are sort of in that mid-range, which are improvements that school departments should consider to be making based on the age of the building, the systems, and the equipment, and the expected lifespan of that.

297
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:19,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Scope three is the third and last priority category.

298
01:11:19,414 --> 01:11:29,237
[SPEAKER_14]: And this category is reserved for items that may not comply with current codes and regulations.

299
01:11:29,337 --> 01:11:37,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And the best examples that I can give you are the accessibility regulations and fire sprinklers.

300
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:42,022
[SPEAKER_14]: And so in the Commonwealth, we have laws and regulations

301
01:11:43,542 --> 01:12:02,553
[SPEAKER_14]: that stipulate if a significant amount of work or if a major renovation is done to a building, there are some triggers that require upgrading for fire sprinklers and for incremental compliance with accessibility regulations.

302
01:12:03,874 --> 01:12:06,976
[SPEAKER_14]: All of these buildings have fire sprinklers, so that's not an issue here.

303
01:12:07,876 --> 01:12:12,139
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there were some minor accessibility items that we did

304
01:12:13,122 --> 01:12:16,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Note, there's nothing that is required to be done now.

305
01:12:16,484 --> 01:12:26,870
[SPEAKER_14]: But as I mentioned, if there were other work being performed in the future of a certain dollar value, those items may need to be corrected.

306
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:38,718
[SPEAKER_14]: And then finally, for scope category number three, this also includes building systems or equipment that are approaching the end of their service life.

307
01:12:39,018 --> 01:12:56,531
[SPEAKER_14]: And the useful service life is the point in time where the costs of continued maintenance and repair will start to outweigh the cost of simply just replacing the equipment or the item.

308
01:12:58,638 --> 01:12:59,419
[SPEAKER_14]: We can go to the next.

309
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:03,062
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we need to flip back on one.

310
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:14,891
[SPEAKER_14]: So the work items are compiled into one of five different assessment categories, the first one being the site.

311
01:13:14,972 --> 01:13:26,621
[SPEAKER_14]: And so these are all the areas that are outside of the building, the parking areas, the walkways, the landscaping, the playgrounds, et cetera, the storm drainage.

312
01:13:27,662 --> 01:13:29,543
[SPEAKER_14]: The second category is the building envelope.

313
01:13:29,763 --> 01:13:35,586
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are the walls, the roof, the doors, the windows, and so forth.

314
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:39,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Building interiors are fairly self-explanatory.

315
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:54,595
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all the things that we see right here in this room, the floor finishes, the ceilings, the walls, accessibility items when they're there, doors, toilet rooms, and so forth.

316
01:13:55,575 --> 01:14:06,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Mechanical systems include our domestic plumbing systems, our fire protection systems, gas, heating, ventilation, air conditioning.

317
01:14:08,468 --> 01:14:18,177
[SPEAKER_14]: And the electrical systems would include the main electrical service, all of the distribution wiring, panel boards, fire alarm system, lighting,

318
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:35,820
[SPEAKER_14]: emergency lighting and egress, communication systems such as phones, paging systems, clock and bell systems, security, computer networking, switches, data wiring, and so forth.

319
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:37,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Next one.

320
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:44,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

321
01:14:44,224 --> 01:14:45,445
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna be able to look at my,

322
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,141
[SPEAKER_14]: slide a little closer.

323
01:14:48,241 --> 01:15:01,905
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is a page very similar to this one, which you'll find in the complete report, which is an explanation of how to read the assessment.

324
01:15:05,449 --> 01:15:11,813
[SPEAKER_14]: So what this shows is an example of a typical work item that you will find in the assessment.

325
01:15:11,853 --> 01:15:13,374
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are dozens of these.

326
01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:16,575
[SPEAKER_14]: This example is from Misutak.

327
01:15:17,856 --> 01:15:20,978
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's the first item in the site category.

328
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:29,723
[SPEAKER_14]: And it describes potholes, cracking at the paving in the parking lot.

329
01:15:30,363 --> 01:15:33,525
[SPEAKER_14]: The recommendation here is to repave

330
01:15:34,327 --> 01:15:39,070
[SPEAKER_14]: parking lot and to provide new painted striping.

331
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:41,732
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a pretty typical item that we see everywhere.

332
01:15:43,273 --> 01:15:49,016
[SPEAKER_14]: The quantity of this particular item is approaching 20,000 square feet.

333
01:15:49,316 --> 01:15:52,478
[SPEAKER_14]: The unit cost that we assigned to this item is $11.90.

334
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:56,000
[SPEAKER_14]: So multiply that gives us a total of almost $237,000.

335
01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:05,026
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we apply the soft costs.

336
01:16:05,286 --> 01:16:18,829
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are the indirect costs that would include the district's administration costs, contingencies, architectural and engineering fees.

337
01:16:19,769 --> 01:16:22,090
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a simple multiplier of 30%.

338
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:29,392
[SPEAKER_14]: So we add 30% on top of those construction costs to get a total cost to address that particular item.

339
01:16:30,456 --> 01:16:34,879
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we assign that item into a scope category that I described earlier.

340
01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:41,044
[SPEAKER_14]: And this item we assign to scope category two.

341
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:48,702
[SPEAKER_14]: It's worth noting here that each of the scope categories has a timeline associated to it.

342
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:56,350
[SPEAKER_14]: So for this assessment, scope one are items that are recommended to be addressed within two years.

343
01:16:57,211 --> 01:17:02,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Scope number two, two to five years, and scope number three is five years and beyond.

344
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:15,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Considering that these items will all be addressed at some point in the future, we also have to account for escalation in construction costs.

345
01:17:16,683 --> 01:17:20,284
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll show you on a later slide on how those are applied.

346
01:17:20,364 --> 01:17:26,986
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the moment, we've been using about 5% compounded on an annual basis.

347
01:17:27,046 --> 01:17:28,446
[SPEAKER_14]: It has been higher.

348
01:17:28,887 --> 01:17:29,927
[SPEAKER_14]: And during COVID, it was

349
01:17:30,832 --> 01:17:31,914
[SPEAKER_14]: significantly higher.

350
01:17:32,475 --> 01:17:40,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Historically, it's been around 4%, but based on current economic conditions, it's about 5%.

351
01:17:40,306 --> 01:17:41,728
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we've been seeing.

352
01:17:45,738 --> 01:17:51,560
[SPEAKER_14]: So just a very quick snapshot of each of the schools with some basic data.

353
01:17:52,561 --> 01:17:58,023
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see that the construction dates are all within a couple of years of each other from 2001 to 2003.

354
01:17:58,063 --> 01:17:59,663
[SPEAKER_14]: So all built at relatively the same time.

355
01:17:59,703 --> 01:18:02,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Brooks is three stories at 95,000 square feet.

356
01:18:02,584 --> 01:18:02,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Missittuck

357
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:16,106
[SPEAKER_14]: four stories, a little bit smaller, about 93,000.

358
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:23,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberts, also four stories and about 95,000 square feet.

359
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:28,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrews, middle, a bit bigger, 104,000 square feet.

360
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:35,655
[SPEAKER_14]: And McGlynn, the largest of the group at 186,000 square feet.

361
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:36,055
[SPEAKER_14]: So all together,

362
01:18:43,678 --> 01:18:47,839
[SPEAKER_14]: This is almost 574,000 square feet.

363
01:18:48,439 --> 01:19:03,123
[SPEAKER_14]: And be mindful of the size of the school.

364
01:19:03,243 --> 01:19:11,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just mention that this total does not include the high school Curtis Tops or any of the other buildings in the school system.

365
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:24,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so you'll also see this table in the full report, the executive summary.

366
01:19:25,801 --> 01:19:39,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, this is the table that totals all of the work items that were identified for each of the schools and all of the scope categories for each.

367
01:19:39,968 --> 01:19:42,730
[SPEAKER_14]: So reading left to right,

368
01:19:44,652 --> 01:19:56,302
[SPEAKER_14]: The total of the scope categories for each school is in the column on the right hand side, and reading top to bottom are the totals for each scope category.

369
01:19:56,322 --> 01:20:03,287
[SPEAKER_14]: So our highest priority category is scope one, and we identified almost $17 million of work.

370
01:20:03,347 --> 01:20:04,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Scope two, 39.2 million, and scope three,

371
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:16,011
[SPEAKER_14]: 11.8 million approximately.

372
01:20:16,931 --> 01:20:26,760
[SPEAKER_14]: So across the bottom of the table, you'll see the inflation factor at 5% so compounded on an annual basis.

373
01:20:27,462 --> 01:20:31,386
[SPEAKER_14]: For scope one, two years, it's 18.6.

374
01:20:32,106 --> 01:20:36,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Scope two, at five years, 50 million.

375
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:40,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Scope three, also at five years, 15 million.

376
01:20:40,494 --> 01:20:49,062
[SPEAKER_14]: So with escalation, all work included, everything that was identified for this report, it totals 83.7 million.

377
01:20:57,196 --> 01:21:10,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so I'll give you some idea of some of the things that without going into too much detail of some of the typical things that we found in our assessment.

378
01:21:13,749 --> 01:21:21,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of the observations were due to deterioration because of age and deferred maintenance.

379
01:21:21,912 --> 01:21:33,916
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was, I think, pretty typical or average of any school of this age, approximately 20, 23 years, 25 years.

380
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:38,317
[SPEAKER_14]: So no real surprises there and no real big concerns either.

381
01:21:40,323 --> 01:22:05,997
[SPEAKER_14]: On the site, on every location, we noticed issues with pavements, the walkways and curbs, some issues with chain link fences, which are perhaps less critical, but these are items that we want to pay attention to because they are potential safety and tripping hazards and always find a high priority in our reports.

382
01:22:08,492 --> 01:22:20,922
[SPEAKER_14]: The building envelope, all of the roofs are a combination of membrane and shingle, mostly membrane, and they are all past their warranty.

383
01:22:21,671 --> 01:22:27,356
[SPEAKER_14]: and they are at the age where they should strongly be considered for replacement.

384
01:22:27,897 --> 01:22:29,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Roofs are absolutely critical.

385
01:22:30,138 --> 01:22:33,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Once they start leaking, it's hard to get them to stop.

386
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:42,149
[SPEAKER_14]: And they cause a lot of problems and potentially some environmental problems if left for long enough.

387
01:22:43,997 --> 01:22:59,432
[SPEAKER_14]: We did a more of a detailed analysis of the roofs and the exterior walls, which was prepared in support of the preparation of the statement of interest to the MSBA.

388
01:23:00,453 --> 01:23:07,520
[SPEAKER_14]: And Ken has told me that recently the MSBA toured Brooks Roberts and

389
01:23:08,523 --> 01:23:15,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Tuck and took a look at those roofs and they will be considered for inclusion.

390
01:23:16,685 --> 01:23:21,448
[SPEAKER_14]: in the MSBA's accelerated repair program, which is good.

391
01:23:21,808 --> 01:23:24,569
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good to be in the MSBA pipeline.

392
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:32,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, the exterior walls of all these schools are some combination of brick or concrete block.

393
01:23:33,313 --> 01:23:37,516
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some minor cracking, some sealants that need to be addressed.

394
01:23:38,456 --> 01:23:41,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing really serious or of great concern.

395
01:23:42,778 --> 01:23:44,880
[SPEAKER_14]: A few issues with windows.

396
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,261
[SPEAKER_14]: The windows are all original.

397
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:57,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the glazing units in the windows have failed, which means the perimeter seal has failed and condensation is inside the glass.

398
01:23:57,608 --> 01:24:02,892
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's that milky appearance that you see sometimes.

399
01:24:02,952 --> 01:24:04,193
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like it's fogged up.

400
01:24:05,194 --> 01:24:06,535
[SPEAKER_14]: And those can be replaced.

401
01:24:06,595 --> 01:24:09,457
[SPEAKER_14]: You do not have to replace the entire window unit to address that.

402
01:24:10,981 --> 01:24:28,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, issues with exterior doors and frames, rust buildup, very, very common, you know, due to exposure to the elements, but also there's a lot of heavy salting and ice melt that we have in front of the entrances.

403
01:24:28,365 --> 01:24:32,006
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that really accelerates the corrosion.

404
01:24:32,326 --> 01:24:33,846
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's very common.

405
01:24:33,886 --> 01:24:36,587
[SPEAKER_14]: We see that at almost every school that we look at.

406
01:24:39,588 --> 01:24:42,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Interiors, no great surprises.

407
01:24:42,589 --> 01:24:45,770
[SPEAKER_14]: The deterioration there is very predictable.

408
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:48,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Carpets get worn out.

409
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:49,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Walls get scuffed.

410
01:24:50,871 --> 01:24:53,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Ceiling tiles get stained.

411
01:24:54,832 --> 01:25:00,033
[SPEAKER_14]: The flooring, there's a lot of VCT, vinyl tile.

412
01:25:01,014 --> 01:25:02,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Every school has it.

413
01:25:03,154 --> 01:25:05,275
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a couple of areas of concern there.

414
01:25:07,425 --> 01:25:18,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Despite all of the cleaning and the waxing, the Brooks and Missittuck in particular appear to have an issue on the ground floor.

415
01:25:20,367 --> 01:25:25,428
[SPEAKER_14]: So the ground floor is a concrete slab on grade.

416
01:25:26,388 --> 01:25:29,569
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a lot of failure in both of those.

417
01:25:29,629 --> 01:25:33,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Missittuck being, I think, significantly worse than Brooks.

418
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:34,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Brooks is also an issue.

419
01:25:36,133 --> 01:25:44,119
[SPEAKER_14]: So the tiles are cracking, they're popping up, they're chipping, and just coming up all over.

420
01:25:44,659 --> 01:25:54,266
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's something going on there and the cause of that is something that goes beyond the scope of this exercise, but

421
01:25:56,027 --> 01:26:10,259
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be an issue related to having excessive moisture in the floor slab or perhaps a structural issue where the slab is moving due to unstable soils.

422
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:16,884
[SPEAKER_14]: There would be some further testing and investigation, I think, to determine exactly what is going on there.

423
01:26:18,771 --> 01:26:23,693
[SPEAKER_14]: It can be a potential tripping or safety hazard.

424
01:26:23,713 --> 01:26:27,675
[SPEAKER_14]: So we recommend that that be addressed.

425
01:26:30,356 --> 01:26:35,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Toilet rooms, I mean, we see all of the things that we expect to see in the toilet rooms.

426
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:40,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Typically the toilet partitions in most cases need to be replaced.

427
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:44,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Fixtures oftentimes need to be replaced as well.

428
01:26:46,332 --> 01:26:54,077
[SPEAKER_14]: The mechanical systems, so these include all of the HVAC equipment and the controls.

429
01:26:55,197 --> 01:27:02,041
[SPEAKER_14]: We do know that the equipment and the controls are currently being replaced.

430
01:27:02,081 --> 01:27:03,883
[SPEAKER_14]: It's ongoing at Andrews and McGlynn.

431
01:27:04,323 --> 01:27:05,764
[SPEAKER_14]: So we did not evaluate that.

432
01:27:07,245 --> 01:27:09,686
[SPEAKER_14]: That's being addressed in another project.

433
01:27:10,186 --> 01:27:12,127
[SPEAKER_14]: But we did look at everything else.

434
01:27:13,128 --> 01:27:19,034
[SPEAKER_14]: All the major pieces of equipment are approaching the end of their useful service life.

435
01:27:20,376 --> 01:27:31,207
[SPEAKER_14]: The boilers, the chillers, the circulator pumps, air handlers, unit ventilators are the things that we see in the classrooms that are underneath the windows.

436
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:33,611
[SPEAKER_14]: condensers and exhaust fans.

437
01:27:34,511 --> 01:27:38,253
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are fairly costly pieces of equipment.

438
01:27:38,693 --> 01:27:49,378
[SPEAKER_14]: But as I mentioned earlier, at some point, the cost of maintenance and repair will begin to eclipse the cost of replacement.

439
01:27:49,438 --> 01:27:54,501
[SPEAKER_14]: So just keep that in mind when you're considering your capital plan.

440
01:27:56,188 --> 01:28:01,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Electrical systems, there really wasn't anything urgent that we saw there and no major concerns.

441
01:28:02,674 --> 01:28:09,219
[SPEAKER_14]: The electrical switchgear and the standby generators, every school has them.

442
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:20,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are critical pieces of equipment and need to be monitored very carefully, especially the standby generator needs regular maintenance and exercise.

443
01:28:21,592 --> 01:28:26,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Fire alarm systems should always be maintained and upgraded and tested.

444
01:28:28,555 --> 01:28:44,423
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some opportunities for improvements with some of the communication systems, such as a voice over IP telephone system or replacement of the paging in the time clock systems, which are fairly obsolete.

445
01:28:45,264 --> 01:28:57,834
[SPEAKER_14]: And then finally, security is always a primary concern and any opportunities to improve security at building entrances for access control is always encouraged.

446
01:29:01,237 --> 01:29:10,164
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to wrap things up, I find it's helpful to remind ourselves sometimes of why we do this.

447
01:29:10,184 --> 01:29:12,726
[SPEAKER_14]: How do we support the goals

448
01:29:15,443 --> 01:29:17,004
[SPEAKER_14]: of the schools and the facilities.

449
01:29:17,544 --> 01:29:23,007
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really what it comes down to is the learning environment.

450
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:26,908
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanna provide the best learning environment that we can for our students.

451
01:29:27,709 --> 01:29:41,675
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there are problems with the building that compromise that learning environment, if they compromise safety, if they compromise security, those are the things that should always be top priority.

452
01:29:42,582 --> 01:29:56,990
[SPEAKER_14]: We also look for opportunities to decrease operating and lifecycle costs for the school district and any improvements that can be made to the operations and maintenance.

453
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:10,137
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally, any opportunity to reduce energy costs by replacing equipment with more efficient equipment can also contribute to ongoing cost savings.

454
01:30:12,899 --> 01:30:14,560
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what we have.

455
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,320
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope that was helpful.

456
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:23,282
[SPEAKER_14]: If you do have the opportunity to review the full report, there's a lot more detail in there.

457
01:30:24,383 --> 01:30:27,944
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there are any questions now, I can try to answer those.

458
01:30:28,744 --> 01:30:32,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Or Ken, I don't know if you had anything else that you wanted to add to that.

459
01:30:35,386 --> 01:30:35,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Rousseau.

460
01:30:38,067 --> 01:30:38,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for that.

461
01:30:39,707 --> 01:30:41,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad we're not going to go through the whole

462
01:30:42,052 --> 01:30:42,732
[SPEAKER_13]: actual report.

463
01:30:43,433 --> 01:30:45,814
[SPEAKER_13]: We might be here all night.

464
01:30:46,074 --> 01:30:46,394
[SPEAKER_13]: 150 pages.

465
01:30:46,434 --> 01:30:48,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that would be a long night.

466
01:30:48,575 --> 01:30:50,476
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't mind a long night, but that's not that much.

467
01:30:51,997 --> 01:31:07,565
[SPEAKER_13]: You said that the things weren't terribly surprising considering the age, but I realize it's asking for a ballpark, but what percentage of this is age versus deferred maintenance?

468
01:31:07,765 --> 01:31:07,845
[SPEAKER_13]: And

469
01:31:09,236 --> 01:31:13,281
[SPEAKER_13]: 10% deferred maintenance is why we're here, or is it 80%?

470
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:17,645
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know I'm asking you for an exact number that you don't have.

471
01:31:18,526 --> 01:31:28,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we did not review it in those terms, but if I had to make a guess, it's probably 80-20 in favor of age.

472
01:31:29,758 --> 01:31:30,359
[SPEAKER_13]: So age is

473
01:31:31,267 --> 01:31:31,707
[SPEAKER_13]: The 80.

474
01:31:31,867 --> 01:31:32,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

475
01:31:32,727 --> 01:31:34,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's better than I expected.

476
01:31:35,568 --> 01:31:36,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that better than you?

477
01:31:37,209 --> 01:31:38,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I expected it the other way around.

478
01:31:38,829 --> 01:31:43,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Because when I joined the school committee, we had a budget for maintenance of like $0.03.

479
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:46,672
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an exaggeration.

480
01:31:46,852 --> 01:31:54,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, the electrical systems, I believe we can't do induction stoves because we don't have enough power.

481
01:31:56,275 --> 01:32:00,396
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you say that things were pretty good there, it was pretty good.

482
01:32:01,503 --> 01:32:03,024
[SPEAKER_13]: to maintain the status quo, correct?

483
01:32:04,305 --> 01:32:04,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

484
01:32:04,885 --> 01:32:17,512
[SPEAKER_14]: So if there are other equipment that you wanted to bring in that would result in an increase on the electrical load, it doesn't necessarily mean that the building can't handle that.

485
01:32:17,592 --> 01:32:19,574
[SPEAKER_14]: It just means that it would need to be looked at.

486
01:32:19,694 --> 01:32:23,276
[SPEAKER_14]: And there may very well be some extra capacity there.

487
01:32:23,356 --> 01:32:30,200
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would keep in mind that all of the lighting has been upgraded.

488
01:32:31,482 --> 01:32:37,690
[SPEAKER_14]: to LED, which is an overall, you know, reduction in in electrical energy use.

489
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:40,533
[SPEAKER_14]: So there should be some spare capacity there.

490
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:45,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we bought induction stoves and had to send them back because there wasn't enough power from the street.

491
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:52,422
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I believe in the building, there wasn't enough capacity to handle it either, because they use a huge amount of power.

492
01:32:53,523 --> 01:32:57,884
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wonder, like status quo is how you determine that it's... Yes.

493
01:32:58,264 --> 01:32:59,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

494
01:32:59,805 --> 01:33:01,546
[SPEAKER_13]: You mentioned time clocks were obsolete.

495
01:33:01,706 --> 01:33:04,687
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm assuming that there must be some old time clocks from back in the...

496
01:33:05,845 --> 01:33:11,368
[SPEAKER_13]: a gazillion years ago, because we have a whole new time clock system that is literally like two months old.

497
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:16,530
[SPEAKER_17]: He's talking about the intercom and clock system in the classroom, not the time clock system.

498
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:16,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

499
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:18,211
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the bell, the intercom system.

500
01:33:18,231 --> 01:33:18,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Got it.

501
01:33:18,471 --> 01:33:20,572
[SPEAKER_17]: That system was original to the buildings.

502
01:33:20,632 --> 01:33:21,193
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, thank you.

503
01:33:21,253 --> 01:33:23,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't think there's a clock that is correct in any school.

504
01:33:23,794 --> 01:33:25,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a clock that's correct in any school in the world?

505
01:33:26,695 --> 01:33:28,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, all right, thank you.

506
01:33:28,256 --> 01:33:29,217
[SPEAKER_13]: That makes much more sense.

507
01:33:29,817 --> 01:33:30,137
Thank you.

508
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:32,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Urso.

509
01:33:33,139 --> 01:33:33,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

510
01:33:36,707 --> 01:33:45,969
[SPEAKER_16]: I think my questions are maybe more for Ken, but I guess one comment.

511
01:33:46,189 --> 01:33:49,730
[SPEAKER_16]: This information will be super helpful as we go into our capital planning.

512
01:33:51,070 --> 01:34:04,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Season here at school committee, so those meetings are already scheduled for November, where we'll be in Ken and I have been in touch about how to like weave this information into the capital planning that will come to the school committee.

513
01:34:04,213 --> 01:34:05,853
[SPEAKER_16]: So all of that is in progress, but.

514
01:34:06,373 --> 01:34:33,964
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the other sort of question I had is like we have this operations hero system that I would call a baby at this point like from a systems perspective and its usage being increasing but not at like full steam just yet and in my mind all of these things are going to be added to that system so that we can track when we've completed them versus like going to find the 150 page report and like

515
01:34:34,455 --> 01:34:36,897
[SPEAKER_16]: keeping track of it manually, is that what you're thinking as well?

516
01:34:38,277 --> 01:34:40,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so there's a couple categories of stuff in here.

517
01:34:41,239 --> 01:34:48,484
[SPEAKER_17]: There are things in here that we will do through our operations budget, through in-house staff or working with DPW or things like that.

518
01:34:48,744 --> 01:34:54,748
[SPEAKER_17]: There are things that we'll do within our operations budget through smaller projects, and then there are things that we'll need to seek capital funding for.

519
01:34:55,308 --> 01:35:08,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Depending on the level of those projects, they'll enter into operations here with different areas, as well as our existing systems need to be categorized into operations here to start building those preventive maintenance schedules that drive all of this.

520
01:35:08,815 --> 01:35:22,121
[SPEAKER_17]: So our first up real big push on that is going to be with all the new stuff that's being installed that Lulin and Andrew is making sure that's properly cataloged with all the preventive maintenance cycles that are generating tickets automatically that we can address either with our own staff or assigned to a contractor.

521
01:35:23,573 --> 01:35:28,063
[SPEAKER_16]: That all sounds incredible and I look forward to all of that work.

522
01:35:29,378 --> 01:35:35,081
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll obviously take in a lot of this information and talk about the capital plan.

523
01:35:35,762 --> 01:35:48,368
[SPEAKER_16]: But I would like for us to report on the overall progress of some of this work, because I think, like you said, some of these things are going to get done, because we're going to do them in the course of our normal budget.

524
01:35:48,428 --> 01:35:51,510
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would like for us to be able to quantify that.

525
01:35:52,170 --> 01:35:58,614
[SPEAKER_16]: There were 20 items on the list, and we did five, and that's 5% of the total value, because I think

526
01:35:59,393 --> 01:36:05,417
[SPEAKER_16]: You know this like this number is like is big, and I don't nobody here seems very surprised by it.

527
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:16,103
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not particularly because we have half a million square feet of buildings and we have lots of roofs, lots of boilers lots and lots and lots and lots of things.

528
01:36:16,703 --> 01:36:19,544
[SPEAKER_16]: And so all of this stuff adds up, especially when they're all old.

529
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:24,325
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think it would be useful for us to understand, we got this report.

530
01:36:24,385 --> 01:36:26,206
[SPEAKER_16]: What progress are we making against it?

531
01:36:26,826 --> 01:36:31,608
[SPEAKER_16]: So that when people are like, well, we gave you this much money.

532
01:36:31,748 --> 01:36:32,708
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you do with it?

533
01:36:32,788 --> 01:36:38,530
[SPEAKER_16]: That there's an easy way for us to demonstrate what progress we're making and, frankly, what progress we're not making.

534
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:43,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Because maybe we need another maintenance person if we want to make meaningful progress.

535
01:36:43,151 --> 01:36:45,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we need two more maintenance people.

536
01:36:46,512 --> 01:36:56,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are conversations we need to be having, but making the case that if we want to make progress on this list and not interrupt student learning, then this is what we need.

537
01:36:56,738 --> 01:37:04,083
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that data look will be important for us to look at, maybe at the end of each school year or something, at budget time.

538
01:37:04,905 --> 01:37:09,792
[SPEAKER_16]: to start to help the community understand the real progress that we're making.

539
01:37:10,052 --> 01:37:11,735
[SPEAKER_16]: We are making a lot of progress.

540
01:37:13,056 --> 01:37:17,643
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think we've ever reported on that, mostly because we were afraid that we weren't.

541
01:37:18,438 --> 01:37:26,360
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think whether we are or we aren't, I just want that like straight story to be available and for us all to like be able to ground in those facts.

542
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:33,801
[SPEAKER_16]: And then my other question was just this kind of assessment is supposed to be done on a regular basis.

543
01:37:33,901 --> 01:37:34,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

544
01:37:34,962 --> 01:37:40,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Like on a cycle of like every X years you should be doing this kind of assessment and what would that number be?

545
01:37:40,543 --> 01:37:46,384
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I would recommend

546
01:37:47,975 --> 01:37:50,736
[SPEAKER_14]: doing them probably once every five years.

547
01:37:50,836 --> 01:37:54,997
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think it can depend on the last one.

548
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:56,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

549
01:37:56,437 --> 01:37:59,218
[SPEAKER_16]: So the first one is always gonna be the worst, right?

550
01:37:59,238 --> 01:38:03,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully.

551
01:38:03,699 --> 01:38:10,441
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, the time period that was identified for this assessment

552
01:38:11,732 --> 01:38:13,714
[SPEAKER_14]: was up to five years.

553
01:38:13,734 --> 01:38:15,275
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really not a long time.

554
01:38:16,116 --> 01:38:23,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Occasionally, we do get requests to do them for longer periods of time, 10, 15 years.

555
01:38:23,241 --> 01:38:30,506
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, the short answer is, you know, if the report was for five years, you should do it for every five years.

556
01:38:30,546 --> 01:38:34,489
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's probably the most aggressive, maybe closer to 10.

557
01:38:34,529 --> 01:38:37,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

558
01:38:37,692 --> 01:38:37,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

559
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Olopade and then Member Reinfeldt.

560
01:38:44,622 --> 01:38:45,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

561
01:38:45,302 --> 01:38:53,184
[SPEAKER_01]: To actually follow up on my colleague's question, are there certain portions of the facility that you find there should be a more routine checkup on?

562
01:38:53,224 --> 01:39:02,648
[SPEAKER_01]: So bathroom facilities or HVAC or electrical, or do you find that just in general we should be on the same timeline, the 10-year recommendation or the five if you want to be more aggressive?

563
01:39:04,348 --> 01:39:08,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, anything in that scope one category is going to be priority.

564
01:39:10,185 --> 01:39:15,250
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of the dollars in that category really come from those roofs.

565
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:19,555
[SPEAKER_14]: So that should probably be a top priority.

566
01:39:19,795 --> 01:39:26,241
[SPEAKER_14]: And being in that MSBA pipeline is a perfect way to get that started.

567
01:39:26,281 --> 01:39:30,806
[SPEAKER_14]: But anything that results in water infiltration

568
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:39,396
[SPEAKER_14]: If the windows start leaking, if the roofs are getting worse, those are the beginnings of problems.

569
01:39:39,736 --> 01:39:42,478
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would focus on those areas.

570
01:39:42,538 --> 01:39:43,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that a helpful answer?

571
01:39:43,538 --> 01:39:44,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's perfect.

572
01:39:44,599 --> 01:39:44,639
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

573
01:39:45,631 --> 01:39:51,036
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another question I had when it comes to this assessment, you know, I haven't looked over the 150 page document fully yet.

574
01:39:52,017 --> 01:40:04,870
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to moving from this current assessment to an actual schematic design and bid process, do you feel like what's the usual timeline that takes to go from where we are now to what it would look like to start that bidding portion?

575
01:40:05,410 --> 01:40:05,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, boy.

576
01:40:07,223 --> 01:40:12,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that could be a very lengthy process, depending on the timeline.

577
01:40:12,725 --> 01:40:22,428
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, a small project, you know, we could probably get designed in business in six months or less.

578
01:40:23,028 --> 01:40:32,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Larger project may take a year or longer, depending on the level of approvals that were required, you know, by the city in terms of permitting.

579
01:40:33,091 --> 01:40:35,152
[SPEAKER_14]: But it really just depends on the scale of the project.

580
01:40:36,652 --> 01:40:50,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in something that you said, I think it's important that I think the committee and I think the general public who may be listening in that for the most part, the things that you found in this assessment, there were no majorly emergent concerns facility-wise about student safety or student learning that have been impacted.

581
01:40:51,077 --> 01:41:00,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there was a longer process to get to that bidding portion, student safety wouldn't be impacted because we're taking a little bit longer to go through that.

582
01:41:02,001 --> 01:41:05,202
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't really see anything of major concern.

583
01:41:05,342 --> 01:41:15,625
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I mentioned, I think when we just started our conversation, if there were issues that were that serious, there probably have already been addressed.

584
01:41:17,025 --> 01:41:20,226
[SPEAKER_14]: So no, we didn't see anything I think that would be a serious

585
01:41:21,227 --> 01:41:22,847
[SPEAKER_14]: issue in the short term.

586
01:41:23,588 --> 01:41:23,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

587
01:41:24,108 --> 01:41:37,111
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last kind of question comment, you said towards the last portion of the assessment mechanical systems, electrical systems about the cost of repairing, you know, it can eventually eclipse the costing of just replacing.

588
01:41:37,451 --> 01:41:37,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

589
01:41:37,611 --> 01:41:38,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit more about that?

590
01:41:38,811 --> 01:41:44,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of concern in the community questions about what that generally looks like when it comes to facility costs.

591
01:41:44,172 --> 01:41:47,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're discussing it, you know, a new refurbished or

592
01:41:48,293 --> 01:41:54,517
[SPEAKER_01]: new high school here in Medford and so there's a lot of conversation about what does that really look like in the immediate cost versus long term.

593
01:41:55,418 --> 01:42:02,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that you mentioned I wondered if you had any, you know, just professional experience about at what point does it eventually eclipse that replacement costs.

594
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:04,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

595
01:42:04,884 --> 01:42:11,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, more in depth I think analysis would be required to answer that question adequately but

596
01:42:13,073 --> 01:42:39,542
[SPEAKER_14]: You might be familiar with the concept of life cycle costing and that there's a process that can be applied where we would consider, for example, mechanical equipment, the cost of replacing the equipment, and then we would factor in the energy savings of that equipment and compare that with the maintenance costs if you didn't replace that equipment.

597
01:42:41,398 --> 01:42:45,303
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get some pretty good results from that.

598
01:42:45,423 --> 01:42:51,831
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would recommend doing a lifecycle cost analysis would probably be the best approach.

599
01:42:52,913 --> 01:42:53,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

600
01:42:53,654 --> 01:42:53,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

601
01:42:56,257 --> 01:42:56,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeldt?

602
01:43:00,374 --> 01:43:07,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I have what is possibly an unfair question because you did very clearly state that the high school was out of scope for this analysis for obvious reasons.

603
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:16,626
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm curious, particularly looking at our upcoming feasibility studies, which obviously are going to be happening with our MSBA

604
01:43:18,674 --> 01:43:20,296
[SPEAKER_08]: committee and design firm.

605
01:43:21,397 --> 01:43:33,070
[SPEAKER_08]: To what extent are these numbers, these assignments of value translatable to a building like the high school that is significantly older than these buildings?

606
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:39,598
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm just wondering, to what extent can we look at this and say if we're seeing these tile changes, these envelope

607
01:43:40,219 --> 01:43:41,759
[SPEAKER_08]: challenges.

608
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:51,642
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, are you asking could we apply this similar cost to the high school if we were to perform that type of analysis?

609
01:43:51,662 --> 01:43:54,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, or would it be significantly higher because it's an older building?

610
01:43:55,243 --> 01:44:09,186
[SPEAKER_14]: I would expect because of the age of the building that we would find, if you think about it on a cost per square foot basis, that it would be more costly to address the high school simply because of its age.

611
01:44:10,726 --> 01:44:20,590
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that building was built in 1970, so significantly older than the buildings that we have here.

612
01:44:21,010 --> 01:44:30,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, because I think the community is going to be looking very carefully at how we're managing our buildings and what that means for new construction and renovation.

613
01:44:30,674 --> 01:44:33,074
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for stepping outside the scope there.

614
01:44:33,094 --> 01:44:34,555
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, you're welcome.

615
01:44:36,808 --> 01:44:37,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

616
01:44:37,568 --> 01:44:44,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau, and then I'm going to go on to introduction of Dr. Meg Mayo-Brown.

617
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:45,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

618
01:44:45,213 --> 01:44:59,361
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this 5% each year, we don't get this work done, that the prices, the costs will increase is an important consideration, especially since Prop 2.5 means we can only get 2.5 more percent.

619
01:44:59,701 --> 01:45:01,562
[SPEAKER_13]: So we go further and further in the hole.

620
01:45:02,807 --> 01:45:12,753
[SPEAKER_13]: I just ran these numbers if we did nothing in seven years, it would be, we would be costing us 15 million more than we would have possibly brought in to pay for it.

621
01:45:14,294 --> 01:45:29,363
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we have the money to pay for most of this stuff anyways, but I just think it's important to note that, you know, this 19.5 million or 18.6 million for the scope one, like those are things we should be doing

622
01:45:30,058 --> 01:45:32,440
[SPEAKER_13]: and FY 26, which we're in right now.

623
01:45:33,201 --> 01:45:35,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Not FY 27 and FY 28 and FY 29.

624
01:45:36,384 --> 01:45:37,425
[SPEAKER_13]: That's this year's work.

625
01:45:38,346 --> 01:45:43,370
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know where or if we have any thoughts on where we're going to get the money for that.

626
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:48,475
[SPEAKER_13]: But all of that will go up more than a million dollars by not doing it this year.

627
01:45:49,959 --> 01:45:52,421
[SPEAKER_13]: and more than another million dollars the next year.

628
01:45:52,881 --> 01:45:55,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Meanwhile, all the other things are going to get more expensive, too.

629
01:45:55,502 --> 01:46:00,025
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the one hand, I'm not surprised by these numbers.

630
01:46:00,065 --> 01:46:11,491
[SPEAKER_13]: On the other hand, I'm wishing I had some kind of medication to help me stop hyperventilating because, I mean, $83 million is our entire school budget.

631
01:46:17,976 --> 01:46:25,480
[SPEAKER_13]: and each year new things are gonna come on to that, that five years out, that five years next year is our two to five.

632
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:29,201
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's something that gets added on after that.

633
01:46:30,382 --> 01:46:44,469
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm really glad to see these numbers, but I also think these are not numbers based on tearing off a roof and discovering that water leaked into everything and whole walls have to be replaced or something crazy.

634
01:46:44,889 --> 01:46:45,589
[SPEAKER_13]: So these are,

635
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:53,123
[SPEAKER_13]: best guesses without invasively looking into the building to find out what's really going on.

636
01:46:53,923 --> 01:47:12,512
[SPEAKER_13]: And so in my mind, I see these as the low end because, I mean, we have had many years of what we like to call deferred maintenance, which is just another way of saying no maintenance.

637
01:47:12,532 --> 01:47:14,133
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've done a good job, I think,

638
01:47:14,795 --> 01:47:22,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally, getting the the code forced us to get some of the HVAC systems up and running in the in these particular schools.

639
01:47:23,407 --> 01:47:31,477
[SPEAKER_13]: And, but, you know, we look at other schools like At the high school, which I know this doesn't cover, but we looked at what would be cost to improve the

640
01:47:33,017 --> 01:47:37,038
[SPEAKER_13]: the heating system in some of the buildings, in some of that building.

641
01:47:37,058 --> 01:47:42,500
[SPEAKER_13]: It turned out there was no way to make it less expensive because they had not actually been running for years.

642
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,721
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can't get more efficient than zero energy use.

643
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:56,704
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just very worried that this is a low-end number, and we don't have a plan for how we're going to... I mean, we used all of the free cash this year alone.

644
01:47:58,622 --> 01:48:01,263
[SPEAKER_13]: By next year, there's no more money to cover any of this stuff.

645
01:48:01,363 --> 01:48:03,664
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm freaking out a little bit.

646
01:48:04,485 --> 01:48:06,746
[SPEAKER_13]: And I assume many of us are.

647
01:48:07,226 --> 01:48:18,111
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we need to make sure the public knows very clearly that we are underfunding our schools to the order of tens of millions of dollars a year.

648
01:48:18,131 --> 01:48:23,593
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is fabulous, but I think

649
01:48:23,986 --> 01:48:25,487
[SPEAKER_13]: member Graham's point about getting it.

650
01:48:25,507 --> 01:48:29,849
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this should be on our website, and I think it should show the progress for this year.

651
01:48:30,229 --> 01:48:34,692
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it should show that each year we didn't get progress.

652
01:48:34,772 --> 01:48:36,333
[SPEAKER_13]: We went further in the hole.

653
01:48:36,773 --> 01:48:44,597
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how to graphically show that, but these things are just going to keep going up, and we're going to spend less than just the increase.

654
01:48:45,258 --> 01:48:48,239
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to thank you for the report.

655
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:49,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I can't sleep.

656
01:48:52,142 --> 01:48:52,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry about that.

657
01:48:57,969 --> 01:48:58,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ntapa.

658
01:49:00,151 --> 01:49:02,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for putting this report together in this summary.

659
01:49:02,453 --> 01:49:04,094
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really helpful to see the breakdowns.

660
01:49:04,154 --> 01:49:19,988
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really helpful to see, you know, in terms of the accessibility needs, in terms of what, you know, should be done now, what should, you know, what can be not deferred further, but what, you know, maybe doesn't need to be acted on immediately.

661
01:49:20,008 --> 01:49:21,750
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why I'm

662
01:49:24,017 --> 01:49:30,082
[SPEAKER_15]: circling back on this question, but our windows, are they all double pane windows for that, for the buildings?

663
01:49:30,262 --> 01:49:32,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, they're double pane insulated.

664
01:49:32,664 --> 01:49:38,688
[SPEAKER_15]: So would we have to regas them in order for them to become insulated again, or to prevent the condensation?

665
01:49:38,709 --> 01:49:44,533
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I know we have to reglaze them, but do we have to come in and also do that process at the same time, or are they still integral in that sense?

666
01:49:44,553 --> 01:49:46,314
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very specific question.

667
01:49:46,334 --> 01:49:47,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I think,

668
01:49:50,267 --> 01:49:57,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of the windows have two sashes, top part and bottom part.

669
01:49:57,694 --> 01:50:00,917
[SPEAKER_14]: So each part has a glazing unit in it.

670
01:50:01,597 --> 01:50:05,261
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of those glazing units may have failed, for example.

671
01:50:05,681 --> 01:50:10,105
[SPEAKER_14]: So really, all that needs to be done is the glazing unit needs to be removed and replaced with a new one.

672
01:50:10,345 --> 01:50:10,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, awesome.

673
01:50:11,126 --> 01:50:13,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's a fairly simple thing to do.

674
01:50:13,608 --> 01:50:13,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.

675
01:50:15,608 --> 01:50:15,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

676
01:50:15,908 --> 01:50:16,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

677
01:50:16,108 --> 01:50:25,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I just also want to press the point, you know, as, as we're pressing points in terms of deferred maintenance and, and all these things to talk about, you know, we've got to get the money to fix things.

678
01:50:25,231 --> 01:50:25,971
[SPEAKER_15]: We also got to fix them.

679
01:50:26,011 --> 01:50:26,211
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

680
01:50:26,371 --> 01:50:27,491
[SPEAKER_15]: And we got to do it correctly.

681
01:50:27,551 --> 01:50:31,412
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can't cheap out on things because this is what happened with C3.

682
01:50:31,472 --> 01:50:32,232
[SPEAKER_15]: We built C3.

683
01:50:32,272 --> 01:50:33,393
[SPEAKER_15]: We paraded C3.

684
01:50:33,413 --> 01:50:34,493
[SPEAKER_15]: C3 was great.

685
01:50:34,533 --> 01:50:35,353
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the new science wing.

686
01:50:35,373 --> 01:50:36,194
[SPEAKER_15]: We're gonna have a great time.

687
01:50:36,214 --> 01:50:36,854
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be awesome.

688
01:50:36,914 --> 01:50:40,715
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the roof is leaking within a year.

689
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:41,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

690
01:50:42,709 --> 01:50:43,089
[SPEAKER_15]: It's awful.

691
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:48,495
[SPEAKER_15]: You shouldn't have four trash cans in a classroom when it's just been redone and all this.

692
01:50:49,616 --> 01:50:58,165
[SPEAKER_15]: So really making sure that, yeah, like member Rousseau said, when we pull the roof off, we need to make sure, hey, as you mentioned, things get worse.

693
01:50:58,205 --> 01:51:01,249
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes one crack leads to multiple, and water gets in there.

694
01:51:01,269 --> 01:51:04,432
[SPEAKER_15]: And water is the real enemy, unfortunately, when it comes to these things.

695
01:51:06,216 --> 01:51:20,256
[SPEAKER_15]: But making sure that you know we don't put ourselves in another situation where we spend, I wasn't on the committee I was in high school at the time, how much money we poured into see three only to possibly have things ruined especially in a science wing contaminants Hello.

696
01:51:22,419 --> 01:51:23,079
[SPEAKER_15]: can be impacted.

697
01:51:23,439 --> 01:51:35,303
[SPEAKER_15]: So making sure that we're using the right materials, we're using the right folks who have the understanding of the materials, because we don't want to replace floor tiles and then step on them and they all crack, or they use the wrong adhesive.

698
01:51:35,343 --> 01:51:36,503
[SPEAKER_15]: And this happens and that happens.

699
01:51:36,543 --> 01:51:46,186
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, not to speculate that we will ever cheap out, not to speculate any of that, but just affirming that we need to make sure that if we're going to spend the money, we might as well spend more.

700
01:51:46,827 --> 01:51:50,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if it breaks, then we have to spend more money.

701
01:51:50,708 --> 01:51:51,428
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just going to be more.

702
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:58,932
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, more things down in our pocket and it's gonna cost more, it would cause less to do it right the first time than to try to fix our mess the second time.

703
01:51:58,952 --> 01:52:00,193
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

704
01:52:02,694 --> 01:52:03,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

705
01:52:03,214 --> 01:52:04,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the presentation.

706
01:52:04,334 --> 01:52:16,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, we have introduction of Dr. Meg Mayo-Brown, NSIP, New Superintendent Induction Program, Program Director and Coach.

707
01:52:16,458 --> 01:52:19,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll pass it over to Dr. Suzanne Galluzzi, our superintendent.

708
01:52:21,178 --> 01:52:22,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

709
01:52:22,078 --> 01:52:25,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited to have my co-chair, Dr. Meg Mayo-Brown.

710
01:52:26,161 --> 01:52:38,347
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to talk a little bit about the NSIPP program, the new superintendent induction program, a little bit about herself, and happy to answer any questions that you may have for her or myself.

711
01:52:39,047 --> 01:52:41,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So without further ado, Dr. Meg Mayo-Brown.

712
01:52:42,029 --> 01:52:42,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

713
01:52:42,809 --> 01:52:44,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Dr. Galussi.

714
01:52:44,851 --> 01:52:48,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening and thank you for the opportunity to join you.

715
01:52:48,873 --> 01:52:58,837
[SPEAKER_03]: As Dr Lucy said my name is Meg male Brown, I serve as the program director for the new superintendent induction program and coach for your superintendent Dr Lucy.

716
01:52:59,889 --> 01:53:07,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to introduce myself and thank you for your support of Dr. Galluzzi's participation in the program.

717
01:53:08,412 --> 01:53:17,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Prior to this work, I served as a superintendent of schools in Massachusetts for 14 years, eight years in Fall River and six years in Barnstable.

718
01:53:19,056 --> 01:53:24,998
[SPEAKER_03]: The new superintendent induction program has supported new superintendents for the past 15 years.

719
01:53:25,538 --> 01:53:27,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Galluzzi is in cohort 16.

720
01:53:28,859 --> 01:53:36,302
[SPEAKER_03]: NSIPP is a three-year induction program for new leaders new to the role of superintendent in Massachusetts.

721
01:53:36,923 --> 01:53:47,007
[SPEAKER_03]: The curriculum centers on instructional leadership, team building, and supervision and evaluation with equity integrated across all content.

722
01:53:47,607 --> 01:53:53,950
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal is to develop transformational leaders who understand and meet the needs of all students.

723
01:53:55,748 --> 01:54:11,494
[SPEAKER_03]: NSIF, as we call it, is a program of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents supported by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Barr Foundation and endorsed by the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

724
01:54:12,614 --> 01:54:22,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Participation overview for Superintendent Galuzzi is year one, she will spend 48 hours of content day learning plus up to six hours a month of coaching.

725
01:54:23,342 --> 01:54:30,748
[SPEAKER_03]: In year two, she will engage in 39 hours of content day learning plus four hours of coaching.

726
01:54:30,928 --> 01:54:42,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And in year three, she joins regional consultancy groups facilitated by a NISP coach where her peer superintendents engage in problems of practice and they meet on a monthly basis.

727
01:54:43,658 --> 01:54:51,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendents consistently report that NISP's content, coaching and collegial networking are highly valuable to their leadership.

728
01:54:52,148 --> 01:55:08,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Each coach works with leaders to establish on-site coaching opportunities, including providing feedback on leadership team meetings, providing feedback on entry planning and findings, visiting classrooms, and observing one-to-one meetings with school and district leaders.

729
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:14,844
[SPEAKER_03]: The relationship between the NISP coach and the superintendent is one of confidentiality.

730
01:55:15,485 --> 01:55:18,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Feedback is provided exclusively to Superintendent Galussi.

731
01:55:19,789 --> 01:55:25,933
[SPEAKER_03]: As a leadership development program, NISP supports leaders as learners with a focus on transformational leadership.

732
01:55:26,573 --> 01:55:31,976
[SPEAKER_03]: NISP supports the development of an entry plan, and in this case, very much a transitional plan for Dr. Galluzzi.

733
01:55:32,477 --> 01:55:42,963
[SPEAKER_03]: The subsequent report of entry findings, which I'm really excited to listen in on that tonight, which sets up the district for a strategy for improvement based on the findings.

734
01:55:43,423 --> 01:55:44,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

735
01:55:44,183 --> 01:55:45,144
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pleasure to be here.

736
01:55:48,413 --> 01:55:49,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

737
01:55:49,293 --> 01:55:50,674
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate the update.

738
01:55:51,154 --> 01:55:52,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Member on top Papa.

739
01:55:56,857 --> 01:56:03,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry if I could just give a point of personal privilege in the last, uh, I was just reminded by my colleagues that I misspoke.

740
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:06,581
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to correct myself when I can in my ramblings.

741
01:56:06,661 --> 01:56:09,402
[SPEAKER_15]: I referred to the weighing the science wing of C three.

742
01:56:09,563 --> 01:56:10,143
[SPEAKER_15]: It's B three.

743
01:56:10,903 --> 01:56:11,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Three was the one that's leaking.

744
01:56:12,424 --> 01:56:12,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Um

745
01:56:14,036 --> 01:56:15,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just, I'm really tired tonight, I'm sorry.

746
01:56:15,898 --> 01:56:18,239
[SPEAKER_15]: But I am informed that C3 is in fact leaking.

747
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:20,401
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was technically correct.

748
01:56:20,801 --> 01:56:21,942
[SPEAKER_15]: I just called it the science wing.

749
01:56:22,763 --> 01:56:24,004
[SPEAKER_15]: But C3 is leaking.

750
01:56:24,344 --> 01:56:27,427
[SPEAKER_15]: B3 was leaking when I was in high school, which was when that was built.

751
01:56:27,827 --> 01:56:30,750
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I was one of the first classes to enter that.

752
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:36,634
[SPEAKER_15]: So just a quick clarification on my misspeaking.

753
01:56:36,654 --> 01:56:39,316
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you to my colleagues behind me for correction.

754
01:56:40,961 --> 01:56:41,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, gosh.

755
01:56:41,542 --> 01:56:46,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Dr. Lucey, anything you want to add about your induction program or everything's going well?

756
01:56:48,123 --> 01:56:55,066
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, I feel very grateful to have the guidance of Dr. Meg Mayo-Brown.

757
01:56:55,106 --> 01:56:58,747
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been wonderful, whether it's texts or phone calls.

758
01:56:59,207 --> 01:57:02,368
[SPEAKER_04]: She's definitely come a couple of times to Medford High School.

759
01:57:02,428 --> 01:57:05,850
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone on some school visits.

760
01:57:05,870 --> 01:57:10,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't told this to the principals yet, but she's going to be joining the next principal cohort meeting.

761
01:57:12,332 --> 01:57:13,393
[SPEAKER_04]: We have those monthly.

762
01:57:14,073 --> 01:57:16,494
[SPEAKER_04]: So she will be joining that next one so that she can

763
01:57:17,374 --> 01:57:22,176
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, participate and observe my instructional leadership with school leaders.

764
01:57:23,037 --> 01:57:27,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm happy and I welcome the feedback and the guidance.

765
01:57:27,959 --> 01:57:30,800
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel quite grateful.

766
01:57:31,401 --> 01:57:31,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

767
01:57:31,801 --> 01:57:32,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

768
01:57:32,301 --> 01:57:32,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

769
01:57:33,962 --> 01:57:36,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, we have our transition entry findings report.

770
01:57:37,043 --> 01:57:40,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll again turn it over to Dr. Galluzzi, our superintendent.

771
01:57:41,566 --> 01:57:42,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeldt.

772
01:57:44,753 --> 01:57:47,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I just had a quick question about NSIPP.

773
01:57:49,418 --> 01:57:50,680
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

774
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:58,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any kind of 360 feedback program or talking to the people that your work impacts?

775
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:04,275
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be a question for Dr. Mayer-Brown.

776
01:58:08,043 --> 01:58:15,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm asking because I've been a part of other executive coaching that does include some of that 360 feedback.

777
01:58:16,350 --> 01:58:17,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the question.

778
01:58:17,331 --> 01:58:30,363
[SPEAKER_03]: In March of each year, each of the three years, Dr. Galussi will participate in a 360 feedback form with her leadership team and principals and whomever actually she wants to provide it to.

779
01:58:31,043 --> 01:58:34,164
[SPEAKER_03]: The results of that feedback go directly to Dr. Galluzzi.

780
01:58:34,424 --> 01:58:42,988
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually advise superintendents not to share it at a public meeting, but actually to share it to inform their own practice and growth as a leader.

781
01:58:43,448 --> 01:58:43,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

782
01:58:43,768 --> 01:58:46,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate knowing that that exists and it's part of the program.

783
01:58:48,410 --> 01:58:48,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

784
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:49,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

785
01:58:49,711 --> 01:58:53,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn it over to you on the transition entry findings report, Dr. Galluzzi.

786
01:58:54,273 --> 01:58:54,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

787
01:58:56,680 --> 01:59:00,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So good evening, Madam Mayor and esteemed members of the school committee.

788
01:59:00,845 --> 01:59:06,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm quite honored to be presenting my interim findings as they are to date.

789
01:59:08,490 --> 01:59:25,956
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I began my tenure as interim superintendent eight months ago I did so with deep gratitude and a strong sense of purpose as someone who grew up in Medford, and is proud to have been educated through its public schools, serving this community has been both a personal honor and a professional privilege.

790
01:59:26,936 --> 01:59:38,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Over these past months, I've had the opportunity to view the district through a new lens, as I listened closely, engaged with stakeholders, and learned from the diverse perspectives that define our school communities.

791
01:59:39,801 --> 01:59:48,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of our district's many strengths, as well as areas where continued focus and alignment are needed.

792
01:59:49,445 --> 01:59:52,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So this report captures that learning and this reflection.

793
01:59:55,058 --> 02:00:12,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to also note that the insights that were gleaned from this process will inform our collective work ahead as we develop a cohesive district strategic plan designed to advance belonging, equity, and excellence for Medford Public Schools.

794
02:00:15,881 --> 02:00:28,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of this was taken from the transition plan that I presented to this body in January, but I'm calling it the transition slash entry plan since I have been in Medford Public Schools for 29 years.

795
02:00:30,168 --> 02:00:33,450
[SPEAKER_04]: But this just highlights a little bit of the purpose of that plan.

796
02:00:33,570 --> 02:00:40,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So first and foremost, it was to maintain consistency and calm in a moment of transition.

797
02:00:42,958 --> 02:00:49,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It was to inform the school community about transition activities and to maintain open communication.

798
02:00:50,144 --> 02:00:59,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of that was strengthening the relationships that I had already had with staff, with families, with caregivers, with students.

799
02:01:00,732 --> 02:01:09,899
[SPEAKER_04]: It was to also look at Medford Public Schools in a new lens and to identify strengths and areas of focus that will help us inform our work moving ahead.

800
02:01:11,271 --> 02:01:14,670
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was to outline the next steps of our work.

801
02:01:18,771 --> 02:01:23,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the buckets of work that I've been doing since January of 2025.

802
02:01:25,133 --> 02:01:29,395
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of this process included gathering stakeholder voice and input.

803
02:01:30,035 --> 02:01:36,697
[SPEAKER_04]: So I facilitated over 30 listening sessions at school communities via Zoom.

804
02:01:37,477 --> 02:01:39,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I met with caregivers, I met with staff.

805
02:01:40,979 --> 02:01:44,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I attended and participated in district and community events.

806
02:01:45,765 --> 02:01:50,329
[SPEAKER_04]: district wide school and leadership meetings, and I reviewed survey data.

807
02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:59,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think it's very critical and important to mention that in this bucket of work, I would say that I did not

808
02:02:00,969 --> 02:02:07,915
[SPEAKER_04]: gather a really diverse input from our diverse community of Medford.

809
02:02:08,655 --> 02:02:18,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that moving forward and to inform the work that we have to do for the strategic plan, I think it's really critical to make sure that we are meeting people where they're at.

810
02:02:20,065 --> 02:02:29,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Though I offered multiple modalities in order for people to participate, it still wasn't representative of what Medford is today.

811
02:02:31,091 --> 02:02:38,416
[SPEAKER_04]: The other bucket of work that informed this was observing in schools, one of my favorite things.

812
02:02:39,797 --> 02:02:46,122
[SPEAKER_04]: But to date, between January and today, I've conducted over 200 classroom visits and observations.

813
02:02:46,923 --> 02:02:51,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've reviewed that data with our senior leadership and school leadership as well.

814
02:02:53,403 --> 02:02:57,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I also worked to enhance my understanding of district operations.

815
02:02:58,206 --> 02:03:00,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we know my background here in Medford.

816
02:03:01,188 --> 02:03:11,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gone from being an educator to a school leader, to the assistant superintendent for elementary schools, to the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.

817
02:03:11,875 --> 02:03:17,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So operations was something I needed to lean into and build that muscle.

818
02:03:18,359 --> 02:03:21,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I did in that area was held a lot of meetings

819
02:03:22,701 --> 02:03:28,384
[SPEAKER_04]: with finance, facilities, IT, athletics, and community schools.

820
02:03:29,445 --> 02:03:32,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I reviewed overall functioning and current structures.

821
02:03:34,353 --> 02:03:42,482
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of that led me to making sure that we had positions in place that could help lead a lot of that work.

822
02:03:43,182 --> 02:03:53,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And so hiring key personnel in these areas to assist the overall functioning of the district, the support needs, the structure and the growth was critical.

823
02:03:54,334 --> 02:04:11,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you saw a little snapshot this evening for the chief operations officer position that was created that has been tremendous in establishing much needed structure, which we'll get to, but in the areas of operations within the city of Medford, the Medford Public Schools.

824
02:04:13,148 --> 02:04:14,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last area was to advance

825
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:20,522
[SPEAKER_04]: and establish shared understanding, alignment, and next steps.

826
02:04:21,522 --> 02:04:45,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, through all of this information that I was gathering, establishing and enhancing district organizations, systems, and structures was and is and always will be critical, continuing instructional alignment that has already been in progress, and informing the upcoming strategic plan.

827
02:04:48,021 --> 02:04:56,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's important to give a little bit of reminder or context about what we've done so far and where we have come.

828
02:04:58,083 --> 02:05:17,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So since being, I would say, I'll go back to 2022 was the time in which my position shifted from the assistant superintendent of elementary to the assistant superintendent of academics and instruction.

829
02:05:18,088 --> 02:05:28,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That position is critical to see the vertical alignment of our academics and our instruction district wide, which we did not have that lens before.

830
02:05:28,628 --> 02:05:30,070
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a big learning year for me.

831
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:39,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really the year where I had to do a lot of learning at the secondary level in a lot of middle school and high school classrooms.

832
02:05:39,375 --> 02:05:42,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were a lot of aha moments during that year.

833
02:05:42,836 --> 02:05:50,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really the year that we decided that we needed to be grounding our work in an instructional vision.

834
02:05:51,721 --> 02:05:56,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it didn't matter if I was in a kindergarten classroom or in AP

835
02:06:00,315 --> 02:06:00,696
[SPEAKER_04]: physics.

836
02:06:02,797 --> 02:06:12,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Standard one content may look different, but how we're teaching all students and the learning environment we're creating for students, that mattered district wide.

837
02:06:13,574 --> 02:06:19,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So that instructional alignment kind of began, I would say, in 2022.

838
02:06:19,517 --> 02:06:27,822
[SPEAKER_04]: That summer, which was 2023, Medford Public Schools attended the Department of Education's first Instructional Leadership Institute.

839
02:06:28,422 --> 02:06:30,443
[SPEAKER_04]: We were lucky that one was housed at Tufts.

840
02:06:30,563 --> 02:06:31,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have far to drive.

841
02:06:32,664 --> 02:06:39,148
[SPEAKER_04]: But that learning for us as a district instructional leadership team was very profound.

842
02:06:39,868 --> 02:06:46,751
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where we grounded in a lot of work that helped us inform our instructional practices.

843
02:06:48,712 --> 02:07:01,118
[SPEAKER_04]: In combination, around that same time, as this body may remember, we had Spring Point, which is, and we had DESE Air Report come.

844
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:13,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were two neutral reports that spoke about the instruction that our students are experiencing every day.

845
02:07:14,407 --> 02:07:26,255
[SPEAKER_04]: That work, along with what we received in terms of professional development, really began to our work in looking at what is the student experience?

846
02:07:27,195 --> 02:07:30,237
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we doing for our planning and for our instruction?

847
02:07:31,543 --> 02:07:35,401
[SPEAKER_04]: That came with us to the development of the instructional plan.

848
02:07:37,449 --> 02:07:43,051
[SPEAKER_04]: That work was done collaboratively with school leaders, with department leaders, with teachers.

849
02:07:44,011 --> 02:07:57,896
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that I have presented on this work before to this body, but I think it's very important to remember that this work was aligned to the Department of Education's expectations for the instructional vision of districts.

850
02:07:58,636 --> 02:08:01,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also is where our core values came from.

851
02:08:04,112 --> 02:08:08,635
[SPEAKER_04]: This work also encompassed our access and opportunity for all.

852
02:08:09,255 --> 02:08:23,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we were at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Instructional Institute over the summer, we were introduced on a district level to the opportunity myth.

853
02:08:24,265 --> 02:08:41,078
[SPEAKER_04]: which is TNTPs, the new teacher project, well-researched, study on how students, even though we're saying that we're providing grade level content, they're just not meeting grade level standards, and why is that?

854
02:08:41,498 --> 02:08:46,162
[SPEAKER_04]: We really dug in to this research as a district team.

855
02:08:47,243 --> 02:08:52,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And teachers, we created a professional development series that lasted the year.

856
02:08:53,382 --> 02:08:55,243
[SPEAKER_04]: and teachers received that.

857
02:08:56,244 --> 02:09:03,228
[SPEAKER_04]: This past year in 2024, 2025, we brought on some sustained coaching for our staff.

858
02:09:03,928 --> 02:09:15,375
[SPEAKER_04]: We've brought on through the Barr Foundation, Unbound Ed, Lynch Leadership Academy, and we've continued our partnership with Hill for Literacy since 2019, I believe.

859
02:09:16,475 --> 02:09:19,457
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this work has come together

860
02:09:21,078 --> 02:09:25,581
[SPEAKER_04]: in our advancement of what we want to see the student experience be.

861
02:09:27,102 --> 02:09:42,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of this work also is creating aligned schedules and walkthrough tools so that our school leaders and our department leaders are coming together and not just like coalescing, but aligning in what we want to see in classrooms.

862
02:09:43,314 --> 02:09:48,218
[SPEAKER_04]: And through this work, as we've explained before, we also at the secondary level, our teachers are

863
02:09:49,582 --> 02:10:01,270
[SPEAKER_04]: We are making sure that our teachers are planning for GLEAM instruction, which means they are planning so that their lessons are grade level, engaging, affirming, and meaningful to our students.

864
02:10:05,633 --> 02:10:06,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

865
02:10:07,435 --> 02:10:18,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought it would be very fitting and really help us continue the work that we have been doing thus far in this district to continue the work

866
02:10:20,607 --> 02:10:29,598
[SPEAKER_04]: with TNTP's national framework, their next year, they went from the opportunity myth to opportunity makers.

867
02:10:30,419 --> 02:10:38,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this framework, my findings are going to be grounded in this framework of belonging, consistency, and coherence.

868
02:10:39,330 --> 02:10:47,336
[SPEAKER_04]: In everything that I've gathered, this frame not only fits the work we've currently been doing, but also fits the work that we have to do.

869
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:57,543
[SPEAKER_04]: It is aligned completely with our instructional vision and I think would be a great launch for the work that we have upcoming for our strategic plan.

870
02:10:59,366 --> 02:11:04,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to capture before we move on, the three pillars.

871
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:10,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Belonging is just to make sure every student feels known, safe, and valued, and my findings will reflect that.

872
02:11:11,096 --> 02:11:18,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Consistency, every student experiences high-quality, grade-level learning in a safe, well-maintained environment.

873
02:11:19,623 --> 02:11:27,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And the coherence is that every system, from instruction to communication to facilities, works together to support learning.

874
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:41,179
[SPEAKER_04]: These are overall just highlights of the strengths and areas for growth that I found in gathering all of this information.

875
02:11:41,860 --> 02:11:45,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Our strengths, we have engaged and supportive stakeholders.

876
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can see it in the Mustang moment.

877
02:11:48,666 --> 02:11:51,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can see it with our student representatives.

878
02:11:53,085 --> 02:12:05,091
[SPEAKER_04]: From our students to our educators, to our staff, to our caregivers, to our community, and to our city partners, we have engaged and supportive stakeholders.

879
02:12:05,851 --> 02:12:10,534
[SPEAKER_04]: We are very lucky that we are in a system where we have so much support.

880
02:12:12,455 --> 02:12:17,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Our students represent diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and talents.

881
02:12:18,318 --> 02:12:19,018
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an asset.

882
02:12:21,696 --> 02:12:25,800
[SPEAKER_04]: We have deep community commitment to students' success and well-being.

883
02:12:26,721 --> 02:12:37,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Over and over again, through anecdotes, through data, there are so many examples of how the community rallies to support our students and our staff and our communities.

884
02:12:37,953 --> 02:12:40,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a wonderful part of Medford Public Schools.

885
02:12:42,053 --> 02:12:53,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And another strength is our shared value for inclusion, equity, safety and excellence, which we see on a continuous basis, even here during these meetings with your resolutions and your support for the work that we're doing.

886
02:12:54,893 --> 02:12:55,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Areas of growth.

887
02:12:56,692 --> 02:12:58,633
[SPEAKER_04]: for the previous report.

888
02:12:59,433 --> 02:13:02,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Maintenance of facilities and security upgrades.

889
02:13:03,034 --> 02:13:04,374
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about some of this.

890
02:13:04,434 --> 02:13:05,515
[SPEAKER_04]: There is work ongoing.

891
02:13:05,755 --> 02:13:09,076
[SPEAKER_04]: There's work still to be done, but that is an area of growth for us.

892
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:11,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Alignment and coherence of communication.

893
02:13:12,957 --> 02:13:30,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this one, there was a wide spectrum of input that I received during my time gathering information, but things that rose to the top and continuously were just the alignment of school to school, that communication varies widely.

894
02:13:31,982 --> 02:13:38,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Classroom communication methods and I would say schedule also varies.

895
02:13:39,324 --> 02:13:41,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Athletic communication and just

896
02:13:42,897 --> 02:13:44,258
[SPEAKER_04]: overall communication chain.

897
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:50,404
[SPEAKER_04]: The other piece of area for growth is capacity expansion of the afterschool program.

898
02:13:51,609 --> 02:13:54,850
[SPEAKER_04]: which we've been doing consistently, but there is still a lot of work to be done.

899
02:13:56,951 --> 02:14:00,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Diversifying our educator staffing.

900
02:14:00,953 --> 02:14:02,833
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a big growth area for us.

901
02:14:02,973 --> 02:14:08,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk a little bit about that, but that is work that needs to be prioritized.

902
02:14:09,176 --> 02:14:14,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Our students need to see representation in their classrooms and in the hallways.

903
02:14:15,378 --> 02:14:21,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And then creating more visible and supportive opportunities for neurodivergent and LGBTQ plus students.

904
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:35,225
[SPEAKER_04]: That also came up in a lot of my community meetings, making sure that all of our students can visibly see the supports that Medford Public Schools is offering them and provides for them.

905
02:14:36,585 --> 02:14:39,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first pillar is belonging.

906
02:14:39,806 --> 02:14:44,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means knowing, supporting, and growing every one of our students.

907
02:14:45,342 --> 02:14:58,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So strengths in this pillar were strong relationships among educators, students, and families, a shared value for inclusion and equity, and deep community connection and pride.

908
02:14:59,537 --> 02:15:06,404
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why the pillar of belonging is so critical is because it's not something we feel, it's something we build.

909
02:15:07,597 --> 02:15:16,689
[SPEAKER_04]: When schools design systems, environments, and routines that are safe, inclusive, and well-cared for, they send a powerful message that everyone matters here.

910
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:24,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Through these structural commitments, everyone is supported to grow, achieve, and believe in their own success.

911
02:15:26,646 --> 02:15:34,392
[SPEAKER_04]: The next slide is going to detail some of the focus areas and a little bit of the action items.

912
02:15:35,092 --> 02:15:42,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will narrate a little bit, some that have been already in progress, some that are yet to come.

913
02:15:42,898 --> 02:15:48,822
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first focus area for belonging is expand student voice and opportunities for leadership.

914
02:15:50,570 --> 02:15:55,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the current implementation of the instructional vision focuses on that.

915
02:15:56,292 --> 02:16:01,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And that GLEAM framework that educators are following also focuses on that.

916
02:16:02,573 --> 02:16:08,535
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure that we're allowing a lot more opportunity for student voice in classrooms.

917
02:16:09,552 --> 02:16:25,441
[SPEAKER_04]: through the feedback we've received from neutral observations to school and district leadership observations, we need to capitalize a little bit more on the amount of time and access students have for voice in classrooms.

918
02:16:26,682 --> 02:16:36,347
[SPEAKER_04]: The instructional vision is providing us that pathway, and we're working on aligned professional development and observational feedback.

919
02:16:38,113 --> 02:16:47,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Fidelity to social emotional learning practices that are already in place is also critical to this work, which is responsive classroom and restorative practices.

920
02:16:48,199 --> 02:16:53,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of what we're really working on is pushing the restorative practices piece a little bit more.

921
02:16:54,302 --> 02:17:03,567
[SPEAKER_04]: It's responsive classroom is a little bit, has more of a solid footing at the elementary level, but restorative practices is a little bit of a growing edge right now.

922
02:17:05,589 --> 02:17:12,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Talbot has made sure that everyone has access to that high-quality text.

923
02:17:12,694 --> 02:17:23,181
[SPEAKER_04]: We are making sure that we're modeling some of this at district leadership meetings, but that is work that is ongoing to make sure we have refreshers in place for our teachers.

924
02:17:24,277 --> 02:17:38,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the Mustang moment, I think, is a really great example of how we are modeling elevating that student voice and why it is so important for the community to hear and just making sure that that transcends into all areas for students.

925
02:17:40,474 --> 02:17:47,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Another focus area is to build structures that help every student and staff and caregiver feel seen, heard, valued, and supported.

926
02:17:48,973 --> 02:17:54,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I think structure is probably going to be a big thread that you see throughout this report.

927
02:17:56,076 --> 02:18:01,159
[SPEAKER_04]: First and foremost, I think the foundation of all of this was the collective charge this year was on belonging.

928
02:18:02,099 --> 02:18:12,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we really want to make sure that students feel that sense in their learning environments so that they feel safe enough to learn and challenge themselves.

929
02:18:13,045 --> 02:18:17,327
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we want to make sure is that connection to how

930
02:18:18,208 --> 02:18:25,877
[SPEAKER_04]: making sure we're holding rigor and expectations for students is also showing them that they belong.

931
02:18:28,463 --> 02:18:31,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Review of engagement strategies across school communities.

932
02:18:32,126 --> 02:18:35,388
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is work that we have started but is also ongoing.

933
02:18:36,049 --> 02:18:43,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So continued support for our LGBTQ plus student groups and increased visibility initiatives.

934
02:18:43,854 --> 02:18:45,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those conversations have started.

935
02:18:46,396 --> 02:18:50,800
[SPEAKER_04]: They 100% will be continuing and need to be prioritized.

936
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:59,284
[SPEAKER_04]: We are in the process of reviewing instructional supports and enrichment for neurodivergent students, especially at the elementary level.

937
02:19:00,045 --> 02:19:10,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in course selection at the high school level, we see a little bit of autonomy and power that students and family members have when they're choosing classes.

938
02:19:11,151 --> 02:19:18,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the middle school level, as was evidenced here tonight, with our new schedule, we have more opportunity for this.

939
02:19:19,955 --> 02:19:22,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the elementary that we really need to be focusing on.

940
02:19:23,039 --> 02:19:24,320
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that spectrum look like?

941
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:35,053
[SPEAKER_04]: How are we enriching neurodivergent students who need a challenge and who need to have some meaningful exposure and access?

942
02:19:37,257 --> 02:19:47,083
[SPEAKER_04]: The professional development that we are continuing in this realm, as I spoke about, instructional vision, GLEAM, but it's also culturally responsive, equity-centered, trauma-informed approaches.

943
02:19:48,844 --> 02:19:51,786
[SPEAKER_04]: In relation to what I spoke about before, it's also safe schools.

944
02:19:51,906 --> 02:19:59,110
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought on, as I reported before, we brought on safe schools this year at the elementary level, all of the elementary staff.

945
02:19:59,670 --> 02:20:05,472
[SPEAKER_04]: had very critical training on safe schools on that first professional development day.

946
02:20:06,112 --> 02:20:17,315
[SPEAKER_04]: That has also led into our elementary principals working with their staff to make sure that we are establishing rainbow clubs at the elementary level.

947
02:20:18,736 --> 02:20:26,598
[SPEAKER_04]: That is work that is beginning right now so that our elementary students and families have that support.

948
02:20:28,468 --> 02:20:37,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, fidelity to responsive classroom, equitable access to programs and supports, and then policies that affirm and protect every student's identity.

949
02:20:38,034 --> 02:20:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really important to call this out, especially for this board here.

950
02:20:44,477 --> 02:20:46,919
[SPEAKER_04]: The school committee has really made sure that this

951
02:20:47,819 --> 02:20:59,310
[SPEAKER_04]: is a priority in the policies that they have brought forward, that they have passed, that they have stamped, that we have made sure are established in Medford Public Schools.

952
02:21:00,251 --> 02:21:06,878
[SPEAKER_04]: First and foremost, I think, is the non-discrimination policy, which included harassment and retaliation.

953
02:21:07,338 --> 02:21:11,502
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the non-discrimination on the basics of gender identity.

954
02:21:12,163 --> 02:21:23,208
[SPEAKER_04]: the immigration enforcement policy, the equal education opportunity policy, the dress code policy, the bullying policy, just to name a few.

955
02:21:25,509 --> 02:21:30,712
[SPEAKER_04]: The last focus area is to update and modernize facilities and security.

956
02:21:34,234 --> 02:21:37,417
[SPEAKER_04]: critical to ensure that safety measures are in place and followed.

957
02:21:38,598 --> 02:21:42,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to stand here and say that this is all perfectly in place.

958
02:21:43,622 --> 02:21:47,625
[SPEAKER_04]: There are places where this is solidly in place.

959
02:21:48,046 --> 02:21:51,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say gold star goes to the Mississippi elementary school.

960
02:21:53,070 --> 02:21:53,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time

961
02:21:54,491 --> 02:21:57,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Talbot and I are visiting for our rounds.

962
02:21:57,774 --> 02:22:02,137
[SPEAKER_04]: We are greeted with a pleasant greeting and then asked what our purpose is.

963
02:22:03,899 --> 02:22:06,881
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to make sure that that model is at every school building.

964
02:22:08,883 --> 02:22:10,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Safe, well-maintained facilities.

965
02:22:10,824 --> 02:22:16,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we heard from Habib and we had Mr. Lord at the podium.

966
02:22:17,109 --> 02:22:22,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And though there are some maybe frightening things about it, I welcome the conversation.

967
02:22:23,279 --> 02:22:31,946
[SPEAKER_04]: to get to some decision-making around what Medford Public Schools can handle in these updates, what needs to be placed in capital planning.

968
02:22:31,966 --> 02:22:37,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I have all the faith in Mr. Lord and his leadership.

969
02:22:37,451 --> 02:22:42,415
[SPEAKER_04]: He has already been establishing wonderful structures, and that's just been three months.

970
02:22:42,655 --> 02:22:46,458
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a lot of faith in where we're headed.

971
02:22:47,930 --> 02:23:00,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other piece is consistent communication and family engagement, which I alluded to before, but the family engagement is definitely a muscle that we need to be flexing a little bit more and building.

972
02:23:02,012 --> 02:23:05,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to the next pillar, which is consistency.

973
02:23:06,253 --> 02:23:09,894
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's ensuring equitable access to high quality learning.

974
02:23:11,454 --> 02:23:16,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Our strengths are dedicated, skilled educators committed to growth and improvement.

975
02:23:17,788 --> 02:23:19,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see that every single day.

976
02:23:19,569 --> 02:23:41,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to call out our educators who it is so evident as we go from classroom to classroom, how much they care about their students and how much work they are putting in to their lessons so that students are getting all that they need and feel supported.

977
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:45,562
[SPEAKER_04]: A collaborative culture among instructional teams is a strength.

978
02:23:46,737 --> 02:23:49,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And our students are a huge strength.

979
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:51,703
[SPEAKER_04]: They are invested and ready for learning.

980
02:23:52,504 --> 02:24:07,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the poignant pieces that I'll expand upon a little bit is no matter what level from classroom to classroom, our students are engaged and they are compliant and they are ready.

981
02:24:08,326 --> 02:24:21,177
[SPEAKER_04]: They are ready for the next level of Medford Public Schools to make sure that we are providing them the excellence, the rigor, the challenge that they deserve, the support that they deserve.

982
02:24:22,578 --> 02:24:28,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again, huge strength for us is engaged caregivers and community members.

983
02:24:28,743 --> 02:24:34,728
[SPEAKER_04]: They are completely committed to advancing instructional excellence and that is seen on a daily basis.

984
02:24:35,933 --> 02:24:37,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does this pillar of consistency mean?

985
02:24:38,756 --> 02:24:49,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It means that building trust and ensuring that every student in every school experiences the same high standard of excellence.

986
02:24:49,808 --> 02:24:57,757
[SPEAKER_04]: It extends beyond instruction to include the environment, the resources, and the communication systems that sustain learning.

987
02:24:59,336 --> 02:25:10,327
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest piece of this is that true consistency means a student's opportunity to succeed doesn't depend on the teacher or the school in which they attend.

988
02:25:11,568 --> 02:25:16,953
[SPEAKER_04]: It is up to us to ensure that that consistency is throughout the entire district.

989
02:25:19,006 --> 02:25:20,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving on to our areas of growth.

990
02:25:21,269 --> 02:25:23,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, before I get to that one, I'm sorry, I forgot about this.

991
02:25:24,994 --> 02:25:26,916
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a brief snapshot.

992
02:25:27,837 --> 02:25:32,223
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a lot more data to pour over.

993
02:25:33,838 --> 02:25:36,099
[SPEAKER_04]: when it comes to ensuring equitable access.

994
02:25:36,139 --> 02:25:40,459
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think this is our accountability data for the past two years.

995
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:51,122
[SPEAKER_04]: It is just an overview and just a snapshot so that you can see a little bit of where we have been just in the past two years.

996
02:25:51,622 --> 02:25:55,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think it's very easy to say there was a lot that was happening last year.

997
02:25:56,563 --> 02:26:10,669
[SPEAKER_04]: around MCAS and regulations that had shifted and executive orders that were in place, but it is still work for us to be looking that our performance overall declined in a lot of subgroups.

998
02:26:12,269 --> 02:26:16,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our Asian and multi-race subgroup

999
02:26:18,290 --> 02:26:19,891
[SPEAKER_04]: showed the most improvement.

1000
02:26:20,811 --> 02:26:25,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those two subgroups made substantial progress in meeting goals.

1001
02:26:27,033 --> 02:26:30,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have work to do across the district and in other subgroups.

1002
02:26:31,135 --> 02:26:37,417
[SPEAKER_04]: And so really, these results highlight the need for consistent instructional quality

1003
02:26:38,357 --> 02:26:47,181
[SPEAKER_04]: data informed and inclusive supports, and targeted interventions to promote equitable progress for all of our learners.

1004
02:26:47,201 --> 02:26:54,965
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a little bit what I highlighted before, we need to make sure that that is happening across the district and not siloed in areas.

1005
02:26:57,686 --> 02:26:59,807
[SPEAKER_04]: So leading to our focus areas,

1006
02:27:02,402 --> 02:27:02,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1007
02:27:05,003 --> 02:27:09,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Strengthen vertical alignment and instructional coaching across levels.

1008
02:27:11,605 --> 02:27:26,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So that vertical alignment that I spoke about before, how we're going to get to that is first and foremost, we're looking at conducting a humanities curriculum review.

1009
02:27:28,065 --> 02:27:40,188
[SPEAKER_04]: and alignment, we need to make sure that curriculum materials and instruction is inclusive and that they are high quality instructional materials.

1010
02:27:41,688 --> 02:27:50,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That is work that is ongoing, that Dr. Talbot is leading in direct work with Dr. Chiesa and her department.

1011
02:27:51,535 --> 02:28:03,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Increased time on learning that we saw through the updated school schedule, which we saw a little bit tonight, has really provided and opened up access and opportunity for our students.

1012
02:28:05,924 --> 02:28:06,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.

1013
02:28:06,924 --> 02:28:16,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And then our district walkthrough schedule, we have been aligning that and developing that so that it is consistent across the district.

1014
02:28:16,550 --> 02:28:17,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So during,

1015
02:28:18,773 --> 02:28:28,811
[SPEAKER_04]: school leadership meetings, during district leadership meetings, everyone is on the same page and everyone is talking about instruction that is aligned to our instructional vision.

1016
02:28:30,867 --> 02:28:38,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And then our continued partnership with UnboundEd, with the Lynch Leadership Academy and with Hill for Literacy.

1017
02:28:38,910 --> 02:28:46,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to note that on the side here, these are some quotes that were gathered in the community meetings and the surveys.

1018
02:28:46,833 --> 02:28:58,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of them that spoke profoundly to me that I wanted to make sure that I included here was, to collect and analyze student data, to design and implement differentiated structures of support,

1019
02:28:58,717 --> 02:29:09,146
[SPEAKER_04]: coaching, and professional development to build the capacity of staff, which includes principals, department leads, and teachers, to deliver and support culturally responsive instruction.

1020
02:29:10,307 --> 02:29:21,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And I view that quote as a charge, and that is work that we are making sure that we can meet for the community member that so profoundly mentioned it.

1021
02:29:22,957 --> 02:29:26,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Another focus area is a review of current student services and supports.

1022
02:29:27,060 --> 02:29:32,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So this came up in varied ways during my community meetings.

1023
02:29:33,543 --> 02:29:46,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Some were around college prep, some were around supports for caregivers, around social emotional supports that the school could help them with.

1024
02:29:48,360 --> 02:29:57,102
[SPEAKER_04]: It came in lots of different veins, but really the importance to this was to make sure that we review current practices and materials.

1025
02:29:58,262 --> 02:30:03,803
[SPEAKER_04]: That is happening now in a lot of our conversations and will be developed throughout the year.

1026
02:30:05,443 --> 02:30:13,664
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also was making sure that we are developing and distributing those resources so that caregivers know where they are.

1027
02:30:14,044 --> 02:30:15,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the ways we've done that is,

1028
02:30:17,797 --> 02:30:25,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Our comms director, Mr. Will Pippicelli has built out part of our website to include a lot of those supports.

1029
02:30:25,839 --> 02:30:32,100
[SPEAKER_04]: There's now at the hands ready resources and support for our immigrant families.

1030
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:46,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've been having conversations around with other department leaders around how can we really be building our website to make sure that it is an area of resource and support for the community.

1031
02:30:47,624 --> 02:30:52,609
[SPEAKER_04]: and then making sure that our professional development is aligned with this core focus.

1032
02:30:53,410 --> 02:31:07,443
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things we're looking at is co-teaching practices and places where they're really rock solid that could model for other areas that might need a little bit of increased professional development.

1033
02:31:09,228 --> 02:31:12,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Another focus area was increased rigor and student voice and learning.

1034
02:31:12,429 --> 02:31:17,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I've mentioned this before, but this is where it shows up in action.

1035
02:31:17,931 --> 02:31:21,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our instructional vision has given the path to that.

1036
02:31:22,312 --> 02:31:27,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Our aligned professional development consultancies and coaching also support that.

1037
02:31:27,914 --> 02:31:33,276
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we're really making sure we're working on is when we're in a classroom,

1038
02:31:34,197 --> 02:31:37,701
[SPEAKER_04]: The lesson plan and the content may be grade level.

1039
02:31:38,302 --> 02:31:45,450
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we're asking students to do to show that learning is the area of focus for us this year.

1040
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:46,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's in the planning.

1041
02:31:47,592 --> 02:31:52,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that looks like, students that might need some scaffolded supports,

1042
02:31:53,559 --> 02:32:00,570
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't want to over support because then we're going to drop that rigor and we're going to have that that lesson now be not grade level.

1043
02:32:01,331 --> 02:32:06,720
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in areas where students might be exceeding above grade level, what does that look like?

1044
02:32:07,765 --> 02:32:10,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the work that we have ongoing this year.

1045
02:32:10,988 --> 02:32:17,234
[SPEAKER_04]: The next professional development day, just two weeks away, is also going to be continuing this.

1046
02:32:17,635 --> 02:32:25,963
[SPEAKER_04]: We have unbounded coming back and continuing that sustained professional development that they did in August.

1047
02:32:27,978 --> 02:32:29,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Instructional technology.

1048
02:32:29,980 --> 02:32:31,481
[SPEAKER_04]: This, this was also a thread.

1049
02:32:31,902 --> 02:32:42,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the things that came up the most, and especially from from caregivers but also from staff was a review of screen time policies and finding that balance.

1050
02:32:43,172 --> 02:32:45,173
[SPEAKER_04]: to technology and offline learning.

1051
02:32:45,634 --> 02:32:56,821
[SPEAKER_04]: And that came through in even right down to not just instructional classroom spaces, but also it's an indoor recess day and do we have to have screen time to fill that time.

1052
02:32:57,642 --> 02:33:03,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a review of how and when we're using technology in classrooms.

1053
02:33:05,248 --> 02:33:09,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And how like the AI policy comes into play is all is all conversation.

1054
02:33:10,714 --> 02:33:13,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course a review and enhancement of monitoring systems.

1055
02:33:14,539 --> 02:33:19,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have firewalls in school but if students are taking those Chromebooks home, what does that look like.

1056
02:33:19,845 --> 02:33:21,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So making sure that we are.

1057
02:33:23,334 --> 02:33:29,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Also providing that communication to caregivers so that they're really clear is a focus area for us.

1058
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:34,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as previously mentioned, continuing to diversify our educator staffing.

1059
02:33:35,365 --> 02:33:38,868
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a significant challenge for Medicare public schools.

1060
02:33:39,649 --> 02:33:43,972
[SPEAKER_04]: We have tried multiple avenues in order to have greater success with this.

1061
02:33:46,054 --> 02:34:04,693
[SPEAKER_04]: We are continuing, well we are starting an audit of our recruitment efforts and procedures, but I think some of the biggest pieces that we're really trying to leverage is our partnerships with local universities for student teachers, as well as our City Year reps.

1062
02:34:04,713 --> 02:34:06,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have some City Year Corps members

1063
02:34:07,175 --> 02:34:10,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And this year we have some city year student teachers.

1064
02:34:10,957 --> 02:34:16,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they were core members in the past, and now they're coming back to Medford Public Schools as student teachers.

1065
02:34:16,619 --> 02:34:26,303
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're hoping that this might be a nice partnership that will provide us with some diverse candidates, as well as the universities that we are partnering with.

1066
02:34:27,023 --> 02:34:34,626
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dr. Talbot is leading that work to bring in more diverse representation within our student teaching

1067
02:34:37,470 --> 02:34:37,831
[SPEAKER_04]: fellows.

1068
02:34:40,035 --> 02:34:43,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last pillar is coherence.

1069
02:34:44,744 --> 02:34:48,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And so coherence is putting all of this together.

1070
02:34:49,127 --> 02:34:53,109
[SPEAKER_04]: It's aligning systems, priorities, and partnerships.

1071
02:34:53,910 --> 02:34:59,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our strength for coherence is a shared vision for student success and community partnership.

1072
02:35:00,594 --> 02:35:03,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a strong sense of purpose and collaboration.

1073
02:35:04,076 --> 02:35:07,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what does it look like when a system is coherent?

1074
02:35:07,858 --> 02:35:17,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it ensures that every part of the district, operations, instruction, and communication work in sync toward a shared purpose.

1075
02:35:18,042 --> 02:35:29,647
[SPEAKER_04]: When systems are aligned and information is clear, families understand expectations, staff can focus on instruction, and students experience stability and trust.

1076
02:35:30,647 --> 02:35:40,935
[SPEAKER_04]: In a coherent system, messages, maintenance, and mission all move together to support learning and belonging for everybody.

1077
02:35:44,037 --> 02:35:48,780
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does this look like for our focus areas?

1078
02:35:49,741 --> 02:35:56,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is really where we start to see the systems that were in some areas woefully needed.

1079
02:35:57,495 --> 02:36:03,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So our first focus area is to improve communication and communication alignment district-wide.

1080
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:13,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I was gathering this information, some of this review of the current systems in place has already started.

1081
02:36:14,226 --> 02:36:19,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we had the SMORES platform for a very long time.

1082
02:36:19,990 --> 02:36:24,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think when I came in as interim, that was one of those intentional,

1083
02:36:24,993 --> 02:36:38,658
[SPEAKER_04]: decisions that I made to make sure that the Friday memo is using the platform that we want school leaders to be using and that there's that consistency for caregivers so that they know what that format is and they can navigate it with ease.

1084
02:36:39,338 --> 02:36:49,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there were places where that maybe wasn't as aligned to the district expectations and there are still areas for improvement.

1085
02:36:49,582 --> 02:36:51,403
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably never going to be perfect, but

1086
02:36:51,970 --> 02:36:55,051
[SPEAKER_04]: That review is ongoing and needed.

1087
02:36:55,672 --> 02:36:58,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to streamline processes and communication chains.

1088
02:36:59,353 --> 02:37:00,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So this came up a lot.

1089
02:37:00,453 --> 02:37:03,155
[SPEAKER_04]: So when parents have questions, who should they reach out to?

1090
02:37:03,935 --> 02:37:08,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So establishing that chain of command was important.

1091
02:37:09,257 --> 02:37:20,982
[SPEAKER_04]: The update of our org chart, which is on the website, I think gives a snapshot for caregivers to understand where they can reach out to

1092
02:37:22,467 --> 02:37:24,189
[SPEAKER_04]: pertaining to what their question may be.

1093
02:37:24,829 --> 02:37:29,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know Principal Cabral at the high school has created her own chain of command.

1094
02:37:30,435 --> 02:37:38,062
[SPEAKER_04]: She has her own org chart so that you can look and see where the key personnel lie and it makes it a little easier.

1095
02:37:38,102 --> 02:37:40,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of that work is in process.

1096
02:37:41,365 --> 02:37:43,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I heard over and over again,

1097
02:37:45,073 --> 02:37:47,174
[SPEAKER_04]: from staff as well as caregivers.

1098
02:37:47,835 --> 02:37:50,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you please do this at least once a year?

1099
02:37:51,297 --> 02:37:58,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that format, which was for my meetings, my community meetings, it was agenda free.

1100
02:37:58,941 --> 02:38:08,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think people really appreciated a dialogue and a discourse to just talk about what they really appreciate and what they really hope.

1101
02:38:09,060 --> 02:38:23,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to make sure that I honor that and that we figure out a way and that we are scheduling and making sure that we're doing in community forums to inform practice, to honor that stakeholder input.

1102
02:38:24,532 --> 02:38:26,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also strengthens belonging.

1103
02:38:26,213 --> 02:38:30,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have some upcoming forums, I think, which will be critical for caregivers around

1104
02:38:33,348 --> 02:38:44,054
[SPEAKER_04]: the vision, the mission, and the leadership of Medford Public Schools, but that is something that I want to make sure stays at least an annual basis.

1105
02:38:44,974 --> 02:38:47,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Continuing facilities maintenance and safety upgrades.

1106
02:38:48,436 --> 02:38:53,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And so some of this work, so you saw this evening the conditions report that has come in, and

1107
02:38:55,160 --> 02:39:02,745
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be aligning that work to our district work as well as the capital planning moving forward.

1108
02:39:03,585 --> 02:39:09,649
[SPEAKER_04]: The creation of the chief operations officer, that position oversees facilities, IT, and security.

1109
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:19,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are three areas that were in desperate need of systems and structures.

1110
02:39:20,726 --> 02:39:24,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mr. Lord has already begun to do that work.

1111
02:39:25,009 --> 02:39:26,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot more to go.

1112
02:39:26,790 --> 02:39:30,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's only been three months, but I am very grateful for that.

1113
02:39:32,333 --> 02:39:43,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I know that this body has already been reported on, but it's very important to note that the security camera upgraded every school, the keyless entry and the vape detectors at the secondary level.

1114
02:39:44,642 --> 02:39:49,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Those upgrades should be finished by the end of this calendar year.

1115
02:39:50,427 --> 02:39:51,448
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go, that's perfect.

1116
02:39:54,050 --> 02:39:56,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's very exciting to us.

1117
02:39:58,548 --> 02:40:00,109
[SPEAKER_04]: really need the keyless entry.

1118
02:40:00,890 --> 02:40:09,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to help the just the overall functioning of the district in ways that we should have been doing a very long time ago.

1119
02:40:10,295 --> 02:40:11,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really excited for that one.

1120
02:40:12,577 --> 02:40:19,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we, Mr. Lord is spearheading the establishment of a district safety committee.

1121
02:40:19,721 --> 02:40:20,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think

1122
02:40:22,462 --> 02:40:28,424
[SPEAKER_04]: in partnership with that, each school has their own, is developing their own safety committee.

1123
02:40:29,865 --> 02:40:51,812
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a lot of interested and dedicated administrators who signed up to be on the district safety committee, but this is gonna be an opportunity for us to make sure we're having frequent and regular conversations with our community and city partners so that we are all aligned in the loop

1124
02:40:52,636 --> 02:40:59,724
[SPEAKER_04]: and making sure that we keep the safety of our buildings and our staff and our students top priority.

1125
02:41:01,026 --> 02:41:02,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Academic coherence and alignment.

1126
02:41:03,681 --> 02:41:06,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is the piece that really is gonna focus on.

1127
02:41:06,182 --> 02:41:13,226
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want it to look different depending on which teacher you get or what school you're in or what team you have at middle school.

1128
02:41:13,386 --> 02:41:16,888
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs to be here are expectations across the district.

1129
02:41:17,509 --> 02:41:25,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So promoting that rigor and that equity and that belonging across all schools and all departments is the priority of this year.

1130
02:41:26,153 --> 02:41:32,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dr. Talbot is leading this work with the school and department leaders.

1131
02:41:33,893 --> 02:41:42,899
[SPEAKER_04]: making sure that we are having high quality instructional materials in the hands of our teachers for our students is critical.

1132
02:41:43,519 --> 02:41:49,082
[SPEAKER_04]: There are places in this district where that is a growing edge for us and that's a focus for this year.

1133
02:41:50,363 --> 02:41:55,106
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will plant a seed that some of that does cost money.

1134
02:41:55,426 --> 02:42:00,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there will be ongoing conversations around needed curriculum.

1135
02:42:02,531 --> 02:42:02,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And then

1136
02:42:03,824 --> 02:42:19,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I've highlighted on it before, but where we are now in terms of taking our instructional vision, the findings of this and more findings to come, and what that looks like for our strategic planning for Metro Public Schools.

1137
02:42:20,935 --> 02:42:30,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And then certainly not least, but lastly, the expansion of our afterschool programs and the capacity for access and equity.

1138
02:42:31,684 --> 02:42:36,067
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of work has been done with this and I'm just, I'm actually really proud of this collaborative effort.

1139
02:42:36,608 --> 02:42:40,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So a task force was established and it is regularly meeting.

1140
02:42:40,290 --> 02:42:41,852
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have a meeting tomorrow night.

1141
02:42:43,032 --> 02:42:47,014
[SPEAKER_04]: We have very dedicated and invested caregivers.

1142
02:42:47,635 --> 02:42:50,096
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two school leaders, two site coordinators.

1143
02:42:51,276 --> 02:42:53,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Pippicelli helps facilitate that.

1144
02:42:53,918 --> 02:42:56,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Megan Fidlecari is also part of that committee.

1145
02:42:56,799 --> 02:42:59,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's doing some great work.

1146
02:42:59,780 --> 02:43:06,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, we've seen about 68 seats added to our afterschool programming just this year alone.

1147
02:43:07,664 --> 02:43:16,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And the basic consultancy, Mr. Andrew Mumford and oh my goodness, I'm going to forget the other gentleman's name.

1148
02:43:16,774 --> 02:43:17,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very sorry.

1149
02:43:18,036 --> 02:43:26,004
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be joining our task force meeting tomorrow as they're beginning their work this school year to really kind of

1150
02:43:26,865 --> 02:43:39,938
[SPEAKER_04]: get a sense as to how we're operating and give us some areas for improvement to really help us be able to grow our capacity in a sustained and meaningful way in benefit of our students and families.

1151
02:43:41,651 --> 02:43:45,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we did see, just one more thing, Mr. Pippisali, I'm sorry.

1152
02:43:45,132 --> 02:43:47,693
[SPEAKER_04]: We did see a staffing upgrade there.

1153
02:43:47,753 --> 02:44:06,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So two of our site coordinators are now full-time, which gives the program a little added support to really be working on making sure that we're as staffed as we possibly can be and what that recruitment looks like and working on what the curriculum looks like.

1154
02:44:07,718 --> 02:44:09,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now you may go, Mr., thank you.

1155
02:44:13,055 --> 02:44:18,340
[SPEAKER_04]: All in all, if we're building for our future together, what does that look like?

1156
02:44:19,081 --> 02:44:25,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think you could see through all of these slides, Medford's greatest strength is really its people.

1157
02:44:26,068 --> 02:44:26,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It really truly is.

1158
02:44:27,029 --> 02:44:32,154
[SPEAKER_04]: We have caring educators, families, and students that are committed to one another.

1159
02:44:32,655 --> 02:44:35,157
[SPEAKER_04]: You see that in every space you go in.

1160
02:44:37,993 --> 02:44:45,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next chapter is now about focus and alignment as we build systems that match our heart with our practice.

1161
02:44:46,495 --> 02:44:49,956
[SPEAKER_04]: so that every student learns, thrives and belongs.

1162
02:44:50,676 --> 02:44:54,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wanna make sure that teachers, that we're equipping teachers with, what does that mean?

1163
02:44:55,237 --> 02:45:02,659
[SPEAKER_04]: You can protect and care for your students while also having high expectations for them academically.

1164
02:45:02,939 --> 02:45:06,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's the work, that's the push this year.

1165
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:08,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Our students are ready and we have to push them.

1166
02:45:09,482 --> 02:45:23,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And so part of this is engaging stakeholders in defining priorities for our vision, mission, and leadership for Medford Public Schools and making sure that we capture those diverse voices in Medford in that work.

1167
02:45:25,335 --> 02:45:36,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the varied format that was discussed at the subcommittee really will go a long way to making sure that we capture every voice in Medford.

1168
02:45:37,461 --> 02:45:53,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And then using these findings between the findings that I have presented here to you this evening and the findings that we will gather through that work, we're gonna have a great pool of resource to be able to pull from in developing Medford's next strategic plan.

1169
02:45:54,705 --> 02:46:09,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And that strategic plan will be a coherent roadmap for systematic improvement and student achievement, detailing the actions and the benchmarks required to achieve sustained success.

1170
02:46:12,136 --> 02:46:19,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that concludes my report of entry findings in building belonging, excellence, and opportunity across Medford Public Schools.

1171
02:46:20,441 --> 02:46:23,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am happy to answer any questions that you may have.

1172
02:46:27,287 --> 02:46:28,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeldt.

1173
02:46:29,468 --> 02:46:30,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Reinfeldt.

1174
02:46:31,249 --> 02:46:31,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1175
02:46:31,609 --> 02:46:35,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to limit myself to one question, at least for now.

1176
02:46:35,892 --> 02:46:37,633
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would love for you to tell us.

1177
02:46:37,813 --> 02:46:49,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think what I love about these findings in this report is that it really does frame what the conditions for learning look like and what we need to do to really maximize those.

1178
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:54,703
[SPEAKER_08]: What I would love to hear from you about is how academic achievement

1179
02:46:55,703 --> 02:47:00,307
[SPEAKER_08]: factors into all of these things, particularly in terms of real-time monitoring.

1180
02:47:00,327 --> 02:47:04,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, you showed the accountability scores, which are informative.

1181
02:47:05,391 --> 02:47:07,213
[SPEAKER_08]: They also tell us what happened.

1182
02:47:08,254 --> 02:47:10,595
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't tell us what is happening actively.

1183
02:47:10,716 --> 02:47:12,197
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would love your thoughts on that.

1184
02:47:12,217 --> 02:47:13,298
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great question.

1185
02:47:13,318 --> 02:47:16,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to remember everything that's in my head right now.

1186
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:22,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for, yeah, I mean, first and foremost, I think you have like the, the high arcing answer to that question.

1187
02:47:23,006 --> 02:47:24,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have some of the,

1188
02:47:24,987 --> 02:47:26,628
[SPEAKER_04]: The nuts and bolts at the bottom.

1189
02:47:28,669 --> 02:47:34,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if I like, I can pick out one small thing around, let's say writing, so one of the areas in which.

1190
02:47:35,832 --> 02:47:40,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford Public Schools probably lost a little bit of the accountability was writing.

1191
02:47:40,756 --> 02:47:52,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we did see in areas that students that were maybe, let's say, you know, classified as meeting expectations, once you calculated that writing score, it dropped them a little bit.

1192
02:47:53,765 --> 02:47:59,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of the areas that we've had discussion about and that, you know, Dr. Talbot is working on is writing.

1193
02:47:59,489 --> 02:48:01,431
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like a nitty gritty piece.

1194
02:48:02,744 --> 02:48:13,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Overarching, I would say, and what I really wanted to kind of point out in this report is that we have all of this data that has helped us inform a little bit about where we're going.

1195
02:48:13,707 --> 02:48:31,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the neutral reports that we've been able to pull from, and a lot of the observations that we've been able to pull from, and some of the data that school leaders get is in our classroom spaces, let's say.

1196
02:48:33,358 --> 02:48:36,100
[SPEAKER_04]: as I mentioned before, but I can kind of like explain a little bit more.

1197
02:48:36,721 --> 02:48:47,369
[SPEAKER_04]: We have really, we have engaged students that are presenting as ready to learn, and we have content that is grade level.

1198
02:48:48,672 --> 02:48:54,894
[SPEAKER_04]: but what we're asking our students to do may not always match that grade level expectation.

1199
02:48:55,714 --> 02:49:02,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think maybe what we're seeing is there's, we need a higher level of discourse in our classrooms.

1200
02:49:02,977 --> 02:49:17,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And so part of the ways that students really understand what they're learning is to grapple with it, is to talk about it with their peers, is to not work maybe in silos or in isolation

1201
02:49:18,150 --> 02:49:19,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know.

1202
02:49:20,062 --> 02:49:21,383
[SPEAKER_04]: spit out content or data.

1203
02:49:21,803 --> 02:49:24,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that is a muscle that we need to flex.

1204
02:49:25,266 --> 02:49:29,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and we need to, excuse me, we need to build, we need to build that.

1205
02:49:29,609 --> 02:49:42,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've kind of seen some of those opportunities, or I could maybe say missed opportunities, that that's part of the professional development that we're doing this year with staff.

1206
02:49:42,899 --> 02:49:44,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does your planning look like?

1207
02:49:44,360 --> 02:49:48,223
[SPEAKER_04]: When you sit down to plan, are we making sure that you're planning

1208
02:49:48,603 --> 02:49:50,845
[SPEAKER_04]: so that your instruction is grade level.

1209
02:49:51,165 --> 02:49:52,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I think we can check the box.

1210
02:49:53,226 --> 02:49:54,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Our instruction is grade level.

1211
02:49:54,687 --> 02:50:01,052
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we move on to those next levels, right, are we making sure that that is engaging for our students?

1212
02:50:01,392 --> 02:50:02,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, how?

1213
02:50:02,493 --> 02:50:03,614
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you making it engaging?

1214
02:50:03,794 --> 02:50:10,098
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you making it affirming for them so that they can see themselves in what they're learning and why it's important?

1215
02:50:10,698 --> 02:50:12,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And then how are you making it meaningful?

1216
02:50:12,460 --> 02:50:12,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So

1217
02:50:14,092 --> 02:50:30,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the levers that I think we need to be pushing and leaning into a little bit more, because I think that leads to a level of understanding that maybe not all of our students are able to engage in.

1218
02:50:30,705 --> 02:50:34,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's doing these walks.

1219
02:50:35,009 --> 02:50:35,789
[SPEAKER_04]: This is learning.

1220
02:50:35,829 --> 02:50:37,611
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see it with our students today, right?

1221
02:50:38,031 --> 02:50:42,475
[SPEAKER_04]: That is happening in some of our challenge classes, because students are actively engaged.

1222
02:50:43,275 --> 02:51:03,740
[SPEAKER_04]: They are problem solving in real time, they are engaged in project based learning, you see it in the vocational schools, you walk in any shop, any student is going to be able to stop and tell you what they're doing, how it aligns to state standards, why it's important, and what they're going to get at the end of this, but that might not be happening in every academic space.

1223
02:51:04,880 --> 02:51:30,332
[SPEAKER_04]: and our students need to be experienced and exposed to that so that when it comes time for standardized tests or an important project where they have to show what they know, we've given them the opportunity to grapple with that and understand that at a level that's much deeper than just

1224
02:51:31,911 --> 02:51:36,374
[SPEAKER_04]: copying something off the board or just spitting back facts.

1225
02:51:36,974 --> 02:51:37,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?

1226
02:51:37,975 --> 02:51:38,355
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.

1227
02:51:38,435 --> 02:51:45,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there's also a component of making sure teachers have the tools to recognize that and draw it out.

1228
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:48,022
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it's not happening, how to intervene.

1229
02:51:48,962 --> 02:51:51,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So how do you know that it's happening in real time?

1230
02:51:53,025 --> 02:51:55,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So to that, I think the things that we put in place

1231
02:51:56,814 --> 02:52:03,837
[SPEAKER_04]: last year, still ongoing, but what has been implemented for this year is one, that GLEAM planning.

1232
02:52:04,718 --> 02:52:11,761
[SPEAKER_04]: We now have an aligned walkthrough tool that has created a crosswalk between GLEAM and our instructional vision.

1233
02:52:12,401 --> 02:52:20,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And so school leaders, department leaders, when they walk in, they're all on the same walkthrough rubric.

1234
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:26,403
[SPEAKER_04]: so that everyone's looking for the same things, talking about the same strengths, growth areas.

1235
02:52:26,863 --> 02:52:33,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the Lynch Leadership Academy professional development that's happening right now is with our school and department leaders.

1236
02:52:33,906 --> 02:52:34,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's coaching.

1237
02:52:35,767 --> 02:52:39,149
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's coaching for observational feedback.

1238
02:52:39,849 --> 02:52:41,230
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coaching to have

1239
02:52:41,861 --> 02:52:44,063
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe some challenging or difficult conversations.

1240
02:52:44,943 --> 02:52:50,467
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Lynch Leadership Academy that comes in is coaching our administrators.

1241
02:52:51,268 --> 02:52:58,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll go through observational rounds and they're coaching our administrators as to how to engage in those conversations.

1242
02:52:59,153 --> 02:53:07,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're observing that inaction so that they're giving our administrators direct feedback.

1243
02:53:08,908 --> 02:53:09,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1244
02:53:09,349 --> 02:53:14,119
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I could talk about this for a very long time, but I see lots of green lights, so I will yield to colleagues.

1245
02:53:18,733 --> 02:53:19,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1246
02:53:20,194 --> 02:53:27,779
[SPEAKER_01]: To go back a little bit to the belonging portion of the slideshow, you talked quite a bit about the fidelity to responsive classrooms and restorative justice.

1247
02:53:27,799 --> 02:53:30,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit more about what that actually looks like?

1248
02:53:30,461 --> 02:53:38,286
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've been discussing that for quite a little while now, and the cost and implementation of these types of practices is very lengthy and can be quite difficult.

1249
02:53:38,306 --> 02:53:39,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to hear a little bit more about that.

1250
02:53:39,987 --> 02:53:40,567
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank you.

1251
02:53:40,768 --> 02:53:42,329
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another thing I could probably talk about all day.

1252
02:53:43,289 --> 02:53:47,412
[SPEAKER_04]: The responsive classroom really came in district-wide alignment during COVID.

1253
02:53:49,599 --> 02:53:55,361
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to make sure that, I mean, that focus was really on social emotional learning at that time.

1254
02:53:55,501 --> 02:53:58,361
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a different level for like that safety feeling.

1255
02:54:00,002 --> 02:54:04,803
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the elementary level, there is responsive classroom.

1256
02:54:04,863 --> 02:54:07,564
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of responsive classroom professional development.

1257
02:54:08,044 --> 02:54:12,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year during the induction week for new teachers, there's training on responsive classroom.

1258
02:54:13,665 --> 02:54:16,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's built in to the elementary schedule.

1259
02:54:17,169 --> 02:54:23,495
[SPEAKER_04]: So every day, elementary students are starting their day in a morning meeting.

1260
02:54:24,496 --> 02:54:25,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's tier one.

1261
02:54:26,398 --> 02:54:28,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So all students are gathered together.

1262
02:54:28,139 --> 02:54:29,961
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no services during that time.

1263
02:54:30,402 --> 02:54:31,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing else is happening.

1264
02:54:32,183 --> 02:54:33,785
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be a blip of like,

1265
02:54:34,657 --> 02:54:40,399
[SPEAKER_04]: a violin or an orchestra lesson once a week, because that's difficult to schedule.

1266
02:54:40,439 --> 02:54:46,201
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is a sacred preserved time so that teachers have their entire class.

1267
02:54:46,361 --> 02:54:48,022
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you build community.

1268
02:54:48,502 --> 02:54:53,324
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you also build expectations, and you are modeling those expectations.

1269
02:54:53,744 --> 02:54:56,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes, as always with students,

1270
02:54:57,045 --> 02:55:04,753
[SPEAKER_04]: There are moments where you have to remodel expectations and that community space is the perfect space to do that.

1271
02:55:05,654 --> 02:55:12,921
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, we also had a teacher that worked on quite well and all summer long.

1272
02:55:12,981 --> 02:55:16,225
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jen Ellis is a teacher at the Brooks.

1273
02:55:16,765 --> 02:55:18,147
[SPEAKER_04]: She worked on aligning

1274
02:55:19,857 --> 02:55:23,999
[SPEAKER_04]: the morning meeting so that we have a district-wide focus once a month.

1275
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:30,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So every month, there is a different focal point for morning meeting, and it starts with the principal.

1276
02:55:30,943 --> 02:55:37,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And the principal is doing grade span assemblies, and they're setting the tone for the entire month.

1277
02:55:37,987 --> 02:55:43,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's other morning meeting activities and lessons that the teachers are carrying out.

1278
02:55:43,514 --> 02:55:47,839
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's this continuous thread throughout the district.

1279
02:55:48,500 --> 02:55:50,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Talbot, this month is responsibility?

1280
02:55:52,292 --> 02:55:53,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, okay, just checking.

1281
02:55:54,472 --> 02:56:09,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not remember it every month, but, and it was great when we were doing some walkthroughs, you could see on the board how the teachers were connecting their morning meeting message to what the principal had just done in the assembly, you know, the day before or the week before.

1282
02:56:09,635 --> 02:56:13,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that thread is pretty well established.

1283
02:56:13,656 --> 02:56:17,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's always areas of focus.

1284
02:56:17,516 --> 02:56:20,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the biggest piece is the restorative practices.

1285
02:56:21,715 --> 02:56:29,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the time when we really made a conscious effort to bring responsive classroom in, it did not exist at the secondary level.

1286
02:56:30,021 --> 02:56:37,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I will have you know, it now goes up to grade eight and this year they're piloting high school.

1287
02:56:38,803 --> 02:56:41,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have, there are two educators in the district.

1288
02:56:42,566 --> 02:56:45,369
[SPEAKER_04]: One is in the process of getting trained by Responsive Classroom.

1289
02:56:45,829 --> 02:56:52,334
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one is a trainer for Responsive Classroom and works for Responsive Classroom.

1290
02:56:52,495 --> 02:56:55,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a high school art teacher, Jen Belanger.

1291
02:56:56,106 --> 02:56:58,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's looking into the high school component just to see.

1292
02:56:59,610 --> 02:57:08,240
[SPEAKER_04]: The restorative practices piece is a high quality instructional material that really works on creating this community.

1293
02:57:09,241 --> 02:57:15,408
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought it in for our secondary staff so that we could create this circle time.

1294
02:57:16,109 --> 02:57:21,471
[SPEAKER_04]: for teachers to be able to do this building of community at the secondary level.

1295
02:57:22,191 --> 02:57:43,897
[SPEAKER_04]: It also is a space where sometimes where trust has been broken or expectations have to be re-established, there is a component to that program that is bringing people together, students and affected students, affected staff, so that there can be a conversation

1296
02:57:45,090 --> 02:57:47,512
[SPEAKER_04]: to repair something that has happened.

1297
02:57:48,212 --> 02:57:55,516
[SPEAKER_04]: The way at the time that this was rolled out at the secondary level around COVID time was like a train the trainer model.

1298
02:57:56,517 --> 02:58:06,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And so bringing on Dr. Talbot, what we're in the process of doing is kind of like looking at what that structure was, because that is something that's a little siloed

1299
02:58:07,003 --> 02:58:07,964
[SPEAKER_04]: across the district.

1300
02:58:08,484 --> 02:58:14,790
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some school leaders and some teachers that are really using restorative practices very well.

1301
02:58:14,810 --> 02:58:22,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there are areas where it's just needs a refresher or not happening at all.

1302
02:58:22,676 --> 02:58:32,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And so first and foremost was equipping everybody with the text, which Dr. Talbot made sure was in the hands of all the school leaders and department leaders.

1303
02:58:33,805 --> 02:58:47,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And then looking at that list of who are our trainers and what can we do, I will say we have made a very intentional effort so that new teachers are trained in restorative practices during induction week.

1304
02:58:47,482 --> 02:58:52,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have two, I believe it's Colleen Mahaney and Cheryl Giordano.

1305
02:58:52,928 --> 02:58:56,790
[SPEAKER_04]: to teachers at the secondary level that have led that in the induction program.

1306
02:58:57,190 --> 02:59:06,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So our new teachers have a frame, but the fidelity of its use is really what we're working on.

1307
02:59:06,355 --> 02:59:08,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

1308
02:59:09,496 --> 02:59:09,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1309
02:59:10,076 --> 02:59:13,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, then our student rep, and member Rousseau, if I have it in order.

1310
02:59:16,059 --> 02:59:16,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1311
02:59:16,459 --> 02:59:20,501
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to say thank you for all of this work.

1312
02:59:22,768 --> 02:59:28,252
[SPEAKER_16]: when we asked you to step into this role, it wasn't on anybody's agenda for the year.

1313
02:59:28,272 --> 02:59:34,117
[SPEAKER_16]: And we also gave you enough time to settle into the job.

1314
02:59:34,417 --> 02:59:38,940
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think by all accounts, you did that very rapidly.

1315
02:59:39,621 --> 02:59:46,485
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm just so thankful that you have done more than just settle into the job and keep the lights on in your time here.

1316
02:59:47,486 --> 02:59:55,135
[SPEAKER_16]: You are creating coherence, to use your word, to the vast majority of things that need to happen here.

1317
02:59:55,395 --> 03:00:00,380
[SPEAKER_16]: And not only are you naming it and framing it, but you also are leading the work.

1318
03:00:00,981 --> 03:00:08,008
[SPEAKER_16]: So I thought this was just a really nice summary that started in, why did you go about things the way that you did?

1319
03:00:09,590 --> 03:00:11,771
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just really wanted to say how much I appreciate it.

1320
03:00:11,831 --> 03:00:22,133
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do agree with you that when we get to, I promise I'll be super fast when we talk about strategic planning, but there's a lot of like interwoven pieces of this that we can build on and move quickly.

1321
03:00:22,253 --> 03:00:22,753
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

1322
03:00:23,173 --> 03:00:23,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1323
03:00:25,394 --> 03:00:29,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve.

1324
03:00:29,975 --> 03:00:30,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Our student rep.

1325
03:00:31,755 --> 03:00:33,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. On top is Mike, please.

1326
03:00:35,096 --> 03:00:35,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do it.

1327
03:00:35,716 --> 03:00:36,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Kat's been doing it for me.

1328
03:00:41,128 --> 03:00:43,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

1329
03:00:44,530 --> 03:00:54,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess this is probably a very small detail, but I wanted to know how to interpret the accountability rating graph, because what exactly is accountability rating?

1330
03:00:54,894 --> 03:00:55,895
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that mean?

1331
03:00:56,195 --> 03:00:57,515
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great question.

1332
03:00:58,376 --> 03:00:59,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Great question.

1333
03:00:59,896 --> 03:01:05,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Department of Education every year gives targets to schools to meet.

1334
03:01:06,758 --> 03:01:16,126
[SPEAKER_04]: and they measure it on a scale of like little progress, moderate progress, substantial progress, well above.

1335
03:01:16,146 --> 03:01:32,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what this means is when we look at all students, we even declined for looking at everyone globally, but then it's really important to look at smaller subgroups of students as well.

1336
03:01:32,999 --> 03:01:35,441
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll see here we have high needs, which encompasses

1337
03:01:36,133 --> 03:01:37,974
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of these categories together.

1338
03:01:38,895 --> 03:01:45,500
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the group of English learners, students that are low income, students with disabilities.

1339
03:01:46,601 --> 03:01:48,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have our racial groups.

1340
03:01:48,162 --> 03:01:53,506
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Asian, Black, African-American, Hispanic, Latino, multi-race, and white.

1341
03:01:54,346 --> 03:02:03,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what the Department of Education looks at is they look globally at how did everybody do in meeting the targets that they established for us.

1342
03:02:04,550 --> 03:02:19,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they also look at all of this subgroups to see in some places, when you first look at the scores or your accountability ratings, it might be that like everyone's looks like they're doing a really great job.

1343
03:02:20,166 --> 03:02:26,493
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you dig a little deeper, sometimes there's groups of students that aren't meeting the targets.

1344
03:02:27,204 --> 03:02:33,107
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really on us to be looking into what's happening here, and how can we help?

1345
03:02:34,068 --> 03:02:47,255
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other piece is that the accountability rating that the Department of Education gives us is they take last year's rating, and then they take the current years.

1346
03:02:47,756 --> 03:02:53,959
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, they took 2024 and 2025, and they did like an average.

1347
03:02:54,960 --> 03:02:56,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how they get their accountability rating.

1348
03:02:58,679 --> 03:03:03,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this done based on like testing based on MCAS?

1349
03:03:03,763 --> 03:03:04,944
[SPEAKER_09]: MCAS.

1350
03:03:05,124 --> 03:03:06,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It is based on the MCAS course.

1351
03:03:08,366 --> 03:03:09,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Only MCAS.

1352
03:03:17,093 --> 03:03:17,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that helpful?

1353
03:03:17,693 --> 03:03:18,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have another question?

1354
03:03:21,716 --> 03:03:24,298
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think I'm good.

1355
03:03:24,738 --> 03:03:25,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1356
03:03:25,719 --> 03:03:26,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau?

1357
03:03:28,858 --> 03:03:40,209
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I actually ask one more thing regarding the... Yeah, I just wanted to try and get a more concrete answer.

1358
03:03:40,229 --> 03:03:49,058
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that you gave a very detailed explanation about how this process is conducted and the importance of this process.

1359
03:03:49,118 --> 03:03:53,042
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we were asking... I don't wanna presume, but I believe we were asking...

1360
03:03:53,936 --> 03:03:58,800
[SPEAKER_18]: mainly for what is the actual accountability rating as a statistic?

1361
03:03:59,301 --> 03:04:02,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it the percentage of students which meet grade level expectations?

1362
03:04:02,323 --> 03:04:02,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it like?

1363
03:04:03,344 --> 03:04:04,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you for that.

1364
03:04:05,026 --> 03:04:05,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1365
03:04:05,566 --> 03:04:06,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

1366
03:04:06,347 --> 03:04:08,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's based on MCAS.

1367
03:04:09,009 --> 03:04:19,338
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a rating as to how Medford Public Schools met the targets that the Department of Education assigned

1368
03:04:20,543 --> 03:04:24,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're using MCAS as the tool in how we met that target.

1369
03:04:24,406 --> 03:04:29,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are looking at all the tests from grade three up to grade 10.

1370
03:04:31,431 --> 03:04:32,072
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize.

1371
03:04:32,112 --> 03:04:33,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I was not clear enough.

1372
03:04:34,874 --> 03:04:36,315
[SPEAKER_18]: What exactly?

1373
03:04:37,816 --> 03:04:39,417
[SPEAKER_18]: Accountability rating is a percentage.

1374
03:04:40,718 --> 03:04:41,979
[SPEAKER_18]: It is a percentage of what?

1375
03:04:46,542 --> 03:04:46,662
[SPEAKER_04]: It's.

1376
03:04:47,995 --> 03:04:49,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry if I'm not clear.

1377
03:04:49,835 --> 03:04:51,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a percentage.

1378
03:04:51,576 --> 03:04:53,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you, you can actually see this yourself.

1379
03:04:53,656 --> 03:05:16,082
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go on the department of education or you just go to Google and you type in Medford accountability rating, it will bring up so that you can see there's a calculation there where they look at it's, I'm going to have to go back and look, I don't want to like misquote the exact calculations, but I want to say it's like, you know, a percentage of how we did last year.

1380
03:05:17,085 --> 03:05:23,767
[SPEAKER_04]: and they take a percentage of how we did this year, and they kind of average that together to give us our accountability rating.

1381
03:05:23,807 --> 03:05:26,028
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're looking over a two-year span.

1382
03:05:26,868 --> 03:05:29,329
[SPEAKER_18]: So it has a temporal aspect.

1383
03:05:29,349 --> 03:05:31,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, what?

1384
03:05:31,230 --> 03:05:33,491
[SPEAKER_18]: So there is a temporal aspect here.

1385
03:05:33,511 --> 03:05:36,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this regarding improvement from prior years?

1386
03:05:36,972 --> 03:05:43,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to- Well, so the importance of this, so as we all know, last year in November, voters did pass

1387
03:05:46,754 --> 03:05:52,678
[SPEAKER_04]: that the MCAS is no longer used as the sole reason for graduation requirements.

1388
03:05:54,139 --> 03:06:04,005
[SPEAKER_04]: But MCAS is still the tool that the Department of Ed is using to make sure that districts are providing grade level standards.

1389
03:06:04,706 --> 03:06:15,853
[SPEAKER_04]: So the MCAS measures how well our students are doing taking a test that is assessing their capacity on grade level standards.

1390
03:06:16,302 --> 03:06:16,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1391
03:06:21,305 --> 03:06:26,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Talbot, I don't want to put you on the spot, but if you think there's any clarity to add, come on up.

1392
03:06:28,510 --> 03:06:29,150
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to.

1393
03:06:29,170 --> 03:06:34,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was a good answer.

1394
03:06:35,894 --> 03:06:37,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1395
03:06:37,415 --> 03:06:38,716
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that was a great answer.

1396
03:06:38,736 --> 03:06:39,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau?

1397
03:06:48,102 --> 03:06:57,624
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the complexity here is that it's, I mean, I'm looking at it right now and it's, there's achievement, growth, high school completion.

1398
03:06:57,664 --> 03:07:06,926
[SPEAKER_13]: There's like many things and many categories and many possible points you can earn and there's points earned and the waiting.

1399
03:07:06,946 --> 03:07:13,287
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, they simplify it and call it a target, but it's not like,

1400
03:07:14,177 --> 03:07:17,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Your MCAT scores this year versus your MCAT scores next year.

1401
03:07:17,818 --> 03:07:24,661
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like most of the DESI data.

1402
03:07:25,601 --> 03:07:33,164
[SPEAKER_13]: They try to give us a number for something that is many, many, many, many numbers that they have a formula for.

1403
03:07:34,161 --> 03:07:41,526
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's this axis that says percentage.

1404
03:07:41,606 --> 03:07:44,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Percentages are supposed to be zero to 100.

1405
03:07:44,128 --> 03:07:45,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody gets a zero, nobody gets 100.

1406
03:07:45,629 --> 03:07:59,679
[SPEAKER_13]: And year over year that is going, if you were doing, if everybody in the district did better, every student, that wouldn't be 100%.

1407
03:08:02,158 --> 03:08:11,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Because unless every student went from wherever they were this year to a perfect MCAS score next year, then I guess everybody would have 100%.

1408
03:08:12,321 --> 03:08:15,462
[SPEAKER_13]: and there would be no possible growth the following year.

1409
03:08:16,682 --> 03:08:27,005
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's when you would get a growth percentage, your growth expectation for next year would be zero because if everybody got 100% on the MCAS this year, you can't do better than that.

1410
03:08:27,585 --> 03:08:35,467
[SPEAKER_13]: And this becomes a real problem in certain very affluent communities where everybody does in fact score very, very high.

1411
03:08:36,308 --> 03:08:37,828
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very challenging.

1412
03:08:38,048 --> 03:08:41,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Their expected growth year over year is very low because

1413
03:08:42,636 --> 03:08:47,878
[SPEAKER_13]: there's no way to measure that anybody's learning anything more because their MCAS scores are so high.

1414
03:08:48,319 --> 03:09:01,925
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's, we as a committee just talk about this and look at this number and mostly we're looking at the lines and how they're going up and down, but what's behind it is very detailed and messy.

1415
03:09:03,305 --> 03:09:10,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I have, thank you to my fellow representative, I've just reviewed the formula posted on,

1416
03:09:12,325 --> 03:09:15,726
[SPEAKER_18]: website, and I understand why you're speaking in such vague terms.

1417
03:09:19,808 --> 03:09:26,130
[SPEAKER_18]: But I, so I apologies for my insistence on that front.

1418
03:09:26,750 --> 03:09:30,272
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I think that given the

1419
03:09:36,504 --> 03:09:49,159
[SPEAKER_18]: far removed nature of this metric from an easily quantifiable improvement or achievement by our students.

1420
03:09:53,494 --> 03:09:57,135
[SPEAKER_18]: sort of would like to know your input on how you plan to interpret this data.

1421
03:09:57,895 --> 03:10:08,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Additionally, Member Ruscio mentioned interpreting the lines on the graph, which is another point of misleading.

1422
03:10:09,218 --> 03:10:11,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, given that it's a bar, it should be bars.

1423
03:10:14,880 --> 03:10:25,828
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I guess for our superintendent here, how do you take this data and interpret it to executive action that you want to take?

1424
03:10:25,908 --> 03:10:28,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Great question.

1425
03:10:30,832 --> 03:10:35,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say that MCAS is just one measure.

1426
03:10:36,356 --> 03:10:44,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what this does is it allows us to see how we are meeting grade level standards

1427
03:10:44,716 --> 03:10:45,899
[SPEAKER_04]: from grades 3 to 10.

1428
03:10:47,283 --> 03:10:52,336
[SPEAKER_04]: It also shows us the areas in which we might want to dig a little bit deeper and look at other data.

1429
03:10:53,184 --> 03:10:56,827
[SPEAKER_04]: because having that like corresponding set would be important.

1430
03:10:56,967 --> 03:11:14,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things we have in the district is the district wide map and WEA map test, which is another data source that gives us information again on grade level standards, but it's nationally normed.

1431
03:11:14,960 --> 03:11:21,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And it allows us to dig a little bit deeper to see the areas and the strands in which students are

1432
03:11:22,418 --> 03:11:27,219
[SPEAKER_04]: doing quite well and then the areas that they may need a little bit more additional support.

1433
03:11:28,440 --> 03:11:38,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Another area of data that I think would be important to look at is also, I'll just maybe say for like the high school level of which you all represent.

1434
03:11:39,219 --> 03:11:44,361
[SPEAKER_04]: would be what do some of our course selections look like?

1435
03:11:45,182 --> 03:11:47,263
[SPEAKER_04]: What do AP classes look like?

1436
03:11:47,703 --> 03:11:49,524
[SPEAKER_04]: What do honors classes look like?

1437
03:11:50,104 --> 03:11:51,304
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the representation?

1438
03:11:51,765 --> 03:11:52,945
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the methodology?

1439
03:11:53,365 --> 03:11:55,326
[SPEAKER_04]: What is happening in those classrooms?

1440
03:11:56,607 --> 03:12:06,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows us to look at our district data in terms of benchmarks that the science teachers are using so that they can talk about how students are doing.

1441
03:12:06,671 --> 03:12:07,532
[SPEAKER_04]: MCAS has some,

1442
03:12:08,372 --> 03:12:22,139
[SPEAKER_04]: great reports that allow us to also dig down to the strands, so that we can see, well maybe Medford Public Schools is doing great in this area of science, but in this particular area of science,

1443
03:12:23,324 --> 03:12:26,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Across the board, students struggled.

1444
03:12:26,686 --> 03:12:33,969
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's gonna be an area for us to say, oh, okay, well, where does this particular area in science come up in our teaching?

1445
03:12:34,689 --> 03:12:38,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it coming up in May so we're not having enough time to actually teach it?

1446
03:12:38,911 --> 03:12:47,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it coming up so that, I don't know, there was something that happened that impact that score or that rating?

1447
03:12:48,195 --> 03:12:51,477
[SPEAKER_04]: But between taking MCAS

1448
03:12:52,648 --> 03:13:14,180
[SPEAKER_04]: and digging down there and then branching it off to our own data that we have internally to really look at what's the story here, that's what's going to help us be able to not only remediate or enhance, but show us what that path could be.

1449
03:13:15,181 --> 03:13:16,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you have to be honest with me.

1450
03:13:17,723 --> 03:13:19,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that direct or clear enough?

1451
03:13:19,944 --> 03:13:21,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, absolutely.

1452
03:13:23,463 --> 03:13:36,011
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, I know that you might want to talk, but I want to ask one more question, which is, this was, my understanding, a statistic that you chose to include on the slides for your presentation.

1453
03:13:36,071 --> 03:13:43,656
[SPEAKER_18]: What about this particular data made you feel that it was indicative of the story you're trying to tell?

1454
03:13:45,017 --> 03:13:46,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Great question.

1455
03:13:47,039 --> 03:13:52,042
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, I think there was a lot of data I could do.

1456
03:13:53,687 --> 03:14:06,815
[SPEAKER_04]: My presentation wasn't necessarily on student data sets, but I really did want to paint a picture that we have some work to do in Medford.

1457
03:14:08,116 --> 03:14:19,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it is only one measure, MCAS is only one measure, but our accountability measures should be higher than they are.

1458
03:14:20,655 --> 03:14:35,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to show on just a landscape that we to encompass what it was last year, what it was this year, and just of the work that we need to do ahead.

1459
03:14:37,925 --> 03:14:38,205
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1460
03:14:39,686 --> 03:14:40,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

1461
03:14:40,926 --> 03:14:43,828
[SPEAKER_18]: I think

1462
03:14:44,979 --> 03:14:52,102
[SPEAKER_18]: drawing concrete conclusions from maybe a nebulous source such as this can be difficult.

1463
03:14:53,983 --> 03:15:08,530
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's some level of concern on that front from my perspective, but I understand that there are alternative sources of data, which I would urge you to use as the basis for your analysis.

1464
03:15:08,610 --> 03:15:11,031
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds like you already are to some extent, but just.

1465
03:15:12,252 --> 03:15:12,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1466
03:15:13,407 --> 03:15:17,789
[SPEAKER_18]: It's important to understand the statistics on which you are basing your actions.

1467
03:15:21,150 --> 03:15:21,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1468
03:15:23,411 --> 03:15:25,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to make sure that I'm getting this right.

1469
03:15:26,632 --> 03:15:38,196
[SPEAKER_09]: So it says overall trends based on the MCAS, which is a very vague sort of data set in general, because it's like standardized testing, and then the sort of

1470
03:15:39,660 --> 03:15:49,745
[SPEAKER_09]: changes from that you use to target the more actually meaningful data sets to see where the actual problem is?

1471
03:15:50,046 --> 03:15:51,566
[SPEAKER_04]: This did not frame everything.

1472
03:15:51,727 --> 03:15:51,907
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1473
03:15:52,007 --> 03:15:56,209
[SPEAKER_04]: This was one data set amongst many data sets.

1474
03:15:56,369 --> 03:16:06,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So the other pieces were my community input, surveys, observations, leadership meetings,

1475
03:16:07,852 --> 03:16:13,754
[SPEAKER_04]: there were lots of data sets in what was informing my report.

1476
03:16:14,274 --> 03:16:16,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was just, MCAS was just one of them.

1477
03:16:20,495 --> 03:16:22,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Pelosi.

1478
03:16:22,336 --> 03:16:24,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1479
03:16:24,736 --> 03:16:26,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Russo, were you all finished?

1480
03:16:26,077 --> 03:16:27,437
[SPEAKER_13]: I hadn't started.

1481
03:16:27,457 --> 03:16:28,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Russo?

1482
03:16:29,458 --> 03:16:29,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1483
03:16:33,671 --> 03:16:36,633
[SPEAKER_13]: I just checked the budget, and we don't have a budget for recruitment.

1484
03:16:36,893 --> 03:16:44,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there actually a recruitment budget sort of tucked in some other line item, or do you plan to add one in the next budget cycle?

1485
03:16:45,579 --> 03:16:48,281
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, no, there is not.

1486
03:16:48,722 --> 03:16:56,367
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are just starting to have conversations right now to inform the budget for fiscal year 27.

1487
03:16:57,268 --> 03:16:57,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1488
03:16:57,668 --> 03:16:59,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So that and professional development

1489
03:17:01,716 --> 03:17:04,597
[SPEAKER_13]: I next unrelated the consistency thing.

1490
03:17:04,637 --> 03:17:10,119
[SPEAKER_13]: I really appreciated that because ironing out these differences between classrooms and schools.

1491
03:17:10,899 --> 03:17:25,824
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when we talk about students that aren't having their needs met or where there's areas that need to focus in the positive way, looking at everything, when everything is different, you don't know where to look.

1492
03:17:26,324 --> 03:17:27,105
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that,

1493
03:17:28,447 --> 03:17:38,193
[SPEAKER_13]: removing as much variation as possible so you can see those differences is a critical first step, a hard first step.

1494
03:17:39,894 --> 03:17:53,283
[SPEAKER_13]: But as a school committee member, hearing one of the things I've heard countless times is parents from one school or classroom who will be friends of parents from another school

1495
03:17:55,894 --> 03:17:56,494
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I'm saying?

1496
03:17:57,935 --> 03:18:01,097
[SPEAKER_13]: And they'll hear about these great things happening at another school.

1497
03:18:01,237 --> 03:18:03,179
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not saying schools should all be the same.

1498
03:18:04,219 --> 03:18:05,680
[SPEAKER_13]: They certainly all have their own cultures.

1499
03:18:05,761 --> 03:18:13,166
[SPEAKER_13]: But they will be things that you're like, yeah, why wouldn't that be happening in every third grade classroom, for instance?

1500
03:18:13,426 --> 03:18:17,569
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's sort of just been a theme, something I've heard over and over for years.

1501
03:18:18,109 --> 03:18:24,814
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad that that's a focus that you recognize as being very important.

1502
03:18:25,797 --> 03:18:41,963
[SPEAKER_13]: I won't bemoan the MCAS data, but I printed the high level reports for MCAS for this year, for the school committee form we just had, and it was two and a half inches thick, and that was the top level summary forms only.

1503
03:18:41,983 --> 03:18:50,686
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's important to understand that the MCAS data you're given would take a staff the whole school year to understand and analyze.

1504
03:18:51,347 --> 03:18:54,968
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a shocking amount of information that you are given

1505
03:18:55,599 --> 03:19:13,495
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't even, the state's website does not show even a fraction, a tiny, it shows a small fraction of the data that you actually have, because you have the student level data, the teacher level data, the school level data in very, very,

1506
03:19:14,223 --> 03:19:15,183
[SPEAKER_13]: graphic detail.

1507
03:19:16,024 --> 03:19:20,566
[SPEAKER_13]: And obviously, much of that can't be public, because it's going to have student information.

1508
03:19:20,686 --> 03:19:29,350
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't have like an individual teacher's performance on the state website, because that doesn't necessarily mean what somebody might conclude.

1509
03:19:30,210 --> 03:19:31,711
[SPEAKER_13]: But you have all that data.

1510
03:19:32,191 --> 03:19:39,154
[SPEAKER_13]: And when it's released, it takes a lot of time and effort to figure out where to go.

1511
03:19:40,578 --> 03:20:01,455
[SPEAKER_13]: And this whole consistency thing is going to be helpful because when I printed out all of these reports to prepare for this forum last week, one of the things that was noticeable was there was a large increase in the dropout rate, also known as a large decrease in the graduation rate.

1512
03:20:02,015 --> 03:20:04,717
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you looked, it was students of

1513
03:20:07,548 --> 03:20:10,410
[SPEAKER_13]: who were very likely immigrants.

1514
03:20:11,470 --> 03:20:12,851
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's been happening?

1515
03:20:12,991 --> 03:20:15,112
[SPEAKER_13]: They've been disappearing from school.

1516
03:20:15,813 --> 03:20:19,515
[SPEAKER_13]: And when a student disappears from school, they're a dropout.

1517
03:20:20,256 --> 03:20:28,200
[SPEAKER_13]: However, if they then re-enroll in a school anywhere else in the country, we get a request for their transcript and they don't count as a dropout.

1518
03:20:28,340 --> 03:20:29,181
[SPEAKER_13]: They're a transfer.

1519
03:20:30,261 --> 03:20:34,624
[SPEAKER_13]: But if they go to another country and they don't ask for their paperwork, they count as a dropout.

1520
03:20:35,309 --> 03:20:39,953
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, a dropout sounds like such a negative way of saying it, but as having dropped out.

1521
03:20:40,914 --> 03:20:51,784
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's important to understand that like a huge increase in, a huge decrease in graduation rates does not necessarily mean anything is happening in the schools.

1522
03:20:53,105 --> 03:21:00,872
[SPEAKER_13]: It could just mean that students have stopped coming to school because of the stuff going on at the federal level that has made

1523
03:21:01,632 --> 03:21:11,757
[SPEAKER_13]: coming to school for many students or staying in the country for many students just and their families not what they want to be doing or they have a choice about.

1524
03:21:12,938 --> 03:21:19,741
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's important not to just look at these high level numbers and decide you know what they mean.

1525
03:21:19,761 --> 03:21:24,364
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's really like we want to interpret the numbers.

1526
03:21:24,604 --> 03:21:25,524
[SPEAKER_13]: They're in our face.

1527
03:21:26,465 --> 03:21:30,747
[SPEAKER_13]: But like this Hispanic Latino number going way down.

1528
03:21:33,174 --> 03:21:37,589
[SPEAKER_13]: it does not necessarily mean that the students that sat and took the test did worse.

1529
03:21:38,377 --> 03:21:40,358
[SPEAKER_13]: could be that they didn't take the test.

1530
03:21:40,458 --> 03:21:45,260
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be the MCAS is required to be taken, well, was required to be taken.

1531
03:21:45,740 --> 03:21:55,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if you didn't speak a single word of English and you showed up the day before MCAS, you were sat down in front of a computer and expected to take a test for which you could not even read.

1532
03:21:56,564 --> 03:22:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think it's important to note that attendance and participation are also part of that factor.

1533
03:22:04,147 --> 03:22:19,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think if we recall last year, we had a school that actually received, they went down in their accountability because in a particular subgroup, there was some students that elected not to take the MCAS.

1534
03:22:19,351 --> 03:22:22,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it is not just achievement data.

1535
03:22:23,212 --> 03:22:27,073
[SPEAKER_04]: There are multiple factors that go into creating the accountability data.

1536
03:22:28,594 --> 03:22:31,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And at standing right now, Medford Public Schools has won

1537
03:22:32,923 --> 03:22:34,264
[SPEAKER_04]: person in the data department.

1538
03:22:35,786 --> 03:22:47,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So to your point about all of the reports, about our compliance with the Department of Education, that's an area that is understaffed, quite honestly.

1539
03:22:47,579 --> 03:22:52,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one person is kind of in charge of or responsible for doing all of the above.

1540
03:22:53,756 --> 03:23:02,602
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to highlight that it is a sea of data, and figuring out where to focus is in many regards a prioritization.

1541
03:23:02,722 --> 03:23:10,847
[SPEAKER_13]: And this report really helps me understand where you're going to look, because the sea is just too much data.

1542
03:23:11,107 --> 03:23:11,807
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

1543
03:23:12,088 --> 03:23:12,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1544
03:23:15,293 --> 03:23:15,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1545
03:23:16,073 --> 03:23:16,954
[SPEAKER_05]: No further questions.

1546
03:23:16,994 --> 03:23:18,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the presentation.

1547
03:23:18,174 --> 03:23:27,998
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll move on to, we do not have any presentations of student council, reports of subcommittees, and no presentations of the public.

1548
03:23:28,738 --> 03:23:38,101
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have continued business, strategic planning update, member Graham, community outreach survey, community input focus group surveys running October through January.

1549
03:23:42,799 --> 03:23:43,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1550
03:23:43,559 --> 03:23:59,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, so the strategic planning subcommittee met last week and we talked about based on the resolution that we all passed unanimously a few weeks back about how do we sort of big reignite our strategic planning process?

1551
03:23:59,342 --> 03:24:11,425
[SPEAKER_16]: So a lot of what Doctor Lucy has talked about today like will all fit nicely, but one of the things that we've never done here from a strategic planning perspective is actually talk to the community at the beginning of the strategic planning process.

1552
03:24:12,405 --> 03:24:15,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I have lots of feelings about what a strategic plan looks like.

1553
03:24:15,568 --> 03:24:23,173
[SPEAKER_16]: And if it's going to be effective, it starts with your constituents, whoever they are, your customers, your constituents.

1554
03:24:23,193 --> 03:24:27,757
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to know what they want before you can build a plan to achieve that thing.

1555
03:24:27,777 --> 03:24:35,963
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you all recall, we explicitly put the strategic plan on hold.

1556
03:24:36,763 --> 03:24:47,128
[SPEAKER_16]: about a year ago, maybe a year and a half, maybe two years ago now, because we were focused on the work that had to be done to advance the high school project.

1557
03:24:47,789 --> 03:24:54,392
[SPEAKER_16]: And then when it became clear that we were going to be making a superintendent transition, it seemed like not the right time to ask a superintendent to

1558
03:24:55,593 --> 03:24:56,894
[SPEAKER_16]: ignite a strategic plan.

1559
03:24:57,094 --> 03:24:58,997
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we asked you to stabilize the district.

1560
03:25:00,238 --> 03:25:02,801
[SPEAKER_16]: And then summer approached and so here we are.

1561
03:25:02,921 --> 03:25:07,246
[SPEAKER_16]: So, like the first possible chance that we have had to sort of get this going again.

1562
03:25:07,926 --> 03:25:12,932
[SPEAKER_16]: So we did meet, and we talked a little bit about wanting to hear from the community in a variety of ways.

1563
03:25:13,792 --> 03:25:16,913
[SPEAKER_16]: And we came up with like two things.

1564
03:25:17,193 --> 03:25:18,174
[SPEAKER_16]: One is a survey.

1565
03:25:18,754 --> 03:25:26,116
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you all remember that when we hired our last superintendent, we did a superintendent survey, we did a survey about what the community was looking for.

1566
03:25:26,136 --> 03:25:30,418
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you also remember we back

1567
03:25:31,233 --> 03:25:43,900
[SPEAKER_16]: six years ago when the mayor took office, her transition planning team, of which I was a part, held a community focus group that talked about what does the community want to see for Medford Public Schools.

1568
03:25:43,980 --> 03:25:49,663
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to bring those two things forward again as good tools to start to hear from folks.

1569
03:25:49,703 --> 03:25:54,546
[SPEAKER_16]: So you all do have in your packet the proposed survey.

1570
03:25:56,006 --> 03:25:57,427
[SPEAKER_16]: I will note a couple things.

1571
03:25:57,987 --> 03:26:22,915
[SPEAKER_16]: The survey is trying to get at questions about our mission as a district, as well as about who you are as a respondent, and to also get some input for all of us as we head into the spring of next year around what people are looking for in a permanent leader of Medford public schools.

1572
03:26:24,096 --> 03:26:31,742
[SPEAKER_16]: So rather than trying to survey people on multiple occasions, trying to sort of wrap all of that in and still be concise so that people will answer it.

1573
03:26:32,903 --> 03:26:50,778
[SPEAKER_16]: So the survey would go out soon and it would obviously be translated, it would be pushed out in a variety of ways, but the demographic information in particular is one of the ways that we will be able to keep tabs on who we're hearing from and who, more importantly, we're not hearing from.

1574
03:26:51,559 --> 03:26:54,443
[SPEAKER_16]: as we collect this information.

1575
03:26:54,563 --> 03:27:07,142
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we did this similar survey about the superintendent search seven years ago, we heard from a lot of people who look like me and not a lot of people who look like Mambarolapati.

1576
03:27:07,882 --> 03:27:16,087
[SPEAKER_16]: And we knew that at the time and we couldn't really do anything about it because we had to hire a new superintendent.

1577
03:27:17,028 --> 03:27:27,174
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think as we have continued our work, we have better tools and strategies to connect to various people, including some of the community liaisons that work for City Hall.

1578
03:27:28,414 --> 03:27:31,876
[SPEAKER_16]: our director of English learner services and others.

1579
03:27:31,956 --> 03:27:38,439
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have to figure out like how do we start to start to like reach those communities in a proportional way.

1580
03:27:38,459 --> 03:27:49,364
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's part of the hope for this survey is not just that we do it and we get information, but that we can collect input from something that resembles our actual population and demographics.

1581
03:27:50,505 --> 03:28:04,505
[SPEAKER_16]: The second thing that we'll do, and I put in here a proposed agenda is hold a series of focus groups where we can do a little bit more freeform dialogue around sort of what comes next for Medford Public Schools from a strategic planning perspective.

1582
03:28:05,286 --> 03:28:09,570
[SPEAKER_16]: And the idea is we'll hold like five or six meetings between now and, say, the end of January.

1583
03:28:09,590 --> 03:28:16,637
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll try to do at least one on Zoom to capture the people who may legitimately not be comfortable coming in person to a meeting.

1584
03:28:17,558 --> 03:28:26,046
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll make sure there's translation services available, but we're interested in hearing from people in that more flexible setting around our mission.

1585
03:28:27,287 --> 03:28:34,788
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the idea once we're done with both of these things is we will have like a clearer picture of what that mission, that working mission might be.

1586
03:28:35,809 --> 03:28:40,209
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we can say, okay, now how do we move that mission forward?

1587
03:28:40,629 --> 03:28:46,150
[SPEAKER_16]: And how do we create a plan that has priorities around the work that we're doing?

1588
03:28:46,190 --> 03:28:55,892
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that's sort of where the work that Dr. Glucy is doing likely fits very nicely into that frame, but we'll see what the frame is and then we'll make decisions about how to go forward.

1589
03:28:57,452 --> 03:29:16,320
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing that I would mention is we are in discussions with the architect because we will also be starting a big amount of community engagement activity for the high school and we are actually talking with them later this week and we've asked them to think about what would their projected timeline look like so we don't survey everybody out all at once.

1590
03:29:17,420 --> 03:29:24,863
[SPEAKER_16]: But are there places where there's some natural overlap that would allow us to reach a single group

1591
03:29:25,563 --> 03:29:27,604
[SPEAKER_16]: And talk to them about a bunch of things at the same time.

1592
03:29:27,684 --> 03:29:31,945
[SPEAKER_16]: So they were going to come prepared with some information about that later this week.

1593
03:29:32,005 --> 03:29:36,105
[SPEAKER_16]: So whether it's five or six exactly when they'll happen exactly where they'll happen.

1594
03:29:36,165 --> 03:29:40,126
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to wait for that information and then go from there.

1595
03:29:40,426 --> 03:29:45,468
[SPEAKER_16]: So the only thing that I would say the minutes did not come forward in this meeting.

1596
03:29:45,488 --> 03:29:46,788
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll have to give you the minutes.

1597
03:29:47,148 --> 03:29:55,980
[SPEAKER_16]: at our next meeting, but the two big outputs from the meeting and the substance of the meeting were what you have in front of you around survey and the proposal for the focus groups.

1598
03:29:56,922 --> 03:30:03,711
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would love it if this group said, yes, we think this is a good plan so that we can get moving because

1599
03:30:04,972 --> 03:30:08,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Every day seems like it burns up faster than the last right now.

1600

1642
03:33:29,766 --> 03:33:36,252
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the, um The list of the so this is a little confusion about this.

1643
03:33:36,292 --> 03:33:37,473
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a new process.

1644
03:33:37,553 --> 03:33:39,515
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is our second or third year, but

1645
03:33:40,288 --> 03:33:45,411
[SPEAKER_13]: second year, but these are the professional associations resolutions.

1646
03:33:45,631 --> 03:33:50,094
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the legislative priorities for them what they try to get the state house to pass.

1647
03:33:51,194 --> 03:33:55,237
[SPEAKER_13]: So we we tell our professional association what to focus on.

1648
03:33:55,937 --> 03:34:05,402
[SPEAKER_13]: And because that list had become untenably long, because they would be there forever until they finally got passed by the state house.

1649
03:34:05,422 --> 03:34:09,765
[SPEAKER_13]: And as you know, our state house is not exactly moving along quick on anything.

1650
03:34:11,200 --> 03:34:24,490
[SPEAKER_13]: So now they expire after three years unless school committees in a majority at the association conference in November vote to reassert that this should be priorities.

1651
03:34:24,770 --> 03:34:36,620
[SPEAKER_13]: So I certainly recommend that all of these things, which we did in fact vote for when they were originally presented, that we would support sending them all back up.

1652
03:34:38,497 --> 03:34:43,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and there's a motion on the floor ready for approval and already seconded so all those in favor.
