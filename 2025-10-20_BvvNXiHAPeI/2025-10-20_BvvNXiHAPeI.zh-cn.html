    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=2623.923s">[Nick Tucci]</a>: 晚上好，Lungo-Koehn 市长、学校委员会成员、Galussi 博士和我们学校委员会的成员。
 我很高兴能在这里向您介绍我们的两位出色的学生，他们在这里分享他们在科学挑战课程中的一些经验，参与我们新的中年级 STEM 计划 Robotics 360。
 Robotics 360 是一个机器人项目，旨在将现实世界的问题解决和 21 世纪技能融入我们的课程中。
 该项目的独特之处在于创造性、协作和技术学习的有意结合。
 学生在本课程中只是简单地构建机器人，它们是工程解决方案。
 他们团队合作应对真正的挑战，在设计、建造和测试机器人的同时，他们还学习编程。
 在课堂环境中，学生们非常热情、投入、积极性很高。
 他们学习的不仅仅是机器人技术，还有如何思考、如何迭代、如何通过一些学术斗争坚持下去。
 这些正是我们打算让高中生参与的年级任务类型。
 我还请切里先生讲几句话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=2696.629s">[Rocco Cieri]</a>: 晚上好，市长、Lungo-Koehn、学校委员会成员和学监。
 和我的同事 Tucci 先生一样，我很高兴在我们学校介绍这项新的 STEM 项目计划。
 我今天下午的发言将很简短。
 我唯一想强调的是，Robotics 360 不是乐高机器人。
 它是一个使用机器人技术的综合 K-12 STEM 教育解决方案。
 其中一个高中组件使用了名为 Lego Spike 的机器人系统。
 它鼓励学生尝试解决这些现实世界的问题。
 编码环境使用基于块的编程，本质上是 Scratch。
 但他们可以轻松地在基于块的编程和允许 Python 编程的屏幕之间切换。
 所以他们可以看到块编程并切换到Python编程。
 他们可以对每一个机器人进行编码，也可以对机器人进行编码。
 这种多功能性是 Robotics 360 所独有的。
 此外，随着学生从幼儿园到高中的课程进展，如果他们愿意，如果他们有完整的课程，课程中的机器人就会发生变化。
 课程挑战发生变化。
 课程会根据学生的水平进行调整，为我们提供未来双向扩展的选择和机会。
 值得注意的是，平台和编程语言永远不会改变。
 因此，当学生学习使用不同的机器人进行编程时，他们不需要每一步都学习全新的编程语言。
 这确保了他们发展真正的编程知识，而不是重新学习所有不同的编码语言。
 今晚您将听到的大部分内容都是学生的经历。
 从我的所见所闻来看，这个计划是成功的。
 虽然才几个月的时间，但学生和老师们都对参加科学挑战课程感到兴奋。
 Robotics 360 继续支持我们的学习分析，在学生对机器人进行编程并通过不同模块时详细收集有关学生学习的定量数据。
 动态地为学生提供课程，以便他们的进步速度与您在课堂上的成功相匹配。
 我将把电话转给图奇先生，介绍麦格林的学生。
 我感谢您今天下午聆听我们的讲话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=2868.801s">[Nick Tucci]</a>: 今晚，我很自豪地向您介绍两位出色的学生，他们是 Robotics 360 试点项目的一部分。
 他们在学年的第一季度参加了科学挑战班。
 今天他们将发自内心地讲述他们的求学经历。
 请和我一起欢迎八年级学生 A.B.
 安娜贝尔·福斯特和奥利弗·恩多耶斯克-桑托斯，六年级学生。
 首先我欢迎安娜贝尔上台。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=2900.253s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 晚上好，我叫安娜贝尔·福斯特，是麦格林中学的八年级学生。
 每个季度我们都有机会根据新的高中时间表参加挑战课程。
 我的第一季度挑战课是科学挑战，我们有机会参与机器人的构建和编码。
 我想简要概述一下科学挑战。
 该课程包括一个带有经过修改的乐高积木的套件和一个用于编码的在线程序。
 我们不仅学习了真实机器人的力学，还学习了如何使用块编码进行编码，这是未来所有编码的基础。
 本学期到目前为止，我和我的小组成员已经进入了第四单元。
 我们目前的任务是建造一个类似螃蟹的机器人，旨在收集水下信息、扫描海洋温度并收集可能有助于未来研究水生生物的数据点。
 除了教授编码之外，它还鼓励我们协作工作，识别和分享我们的个人技能，以提高整个团队的水平。
 编码和团队建设都具有其他主题中经常缺少的实际应用程序。
 作为学生，我们最常问自己的是如何在现实世界中使用它？
 我们如何利用毕达哥拉斯定理赚取收入或纳税？
 该程序有许多实际应用。
 该计划带来了团队建设的各个方面，以及学习如何追随自己的优势和劣势并为团队做出贡献。
 具有挑战性的课程提供对其他主题的深入接触，从而改变人们对某些可能不喜欢的领域的看法。
 科学挑战需要分组编码。
 这意味着我们必须在小组内划分任务并制定一个连贯的计划。
 尽管我无意成为一名程序员，但该程序和科学挑战有多种应用。
 显然，它教您如何编码，但它也可以帮助人们一起工作，了解他们的个人优势，并允许他们以独特且有意义的方式做出贡献。
 团队学会分担责任。
 我渴望有一天能在医疗领域工作，特别是外科手术。
 参与这样的任务可以更好地帮助我培养实现目标所需的技能。
 特别是这门课程为我提供了协作方面的知识，并挑战我坚持从事有意义的科学任务。
 感谢您花时间聆听我今年迄今为止的经历，我很高兴回答您的任何问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3040.609s">[Nick Tucci]</a>: 接下来登上领奖台的是六年级的奥利弗·多耶斯基-桑托斯 (Oliver Doyeski-Santos)。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3049.333s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 晚安。
 我叫奥利。
 我在麦格林中学读六年级。
 这是我在梅德福公立学校的第一年。
 有一天，我希望能为 NASA 工作，我很兴奋，因为在六年级时，我们已经在学习如何编码和构建机器人，这是我将来可以用来帮助我实现目标的一项技能。
 我第一次学习编程是在四年级。
 不幸的是，我并没有从中得到什么，因为班上有很多孩子。
 但今年，在我的科学挑战课上，我有机会参与这项工作。
 在科学挑战课程中，我们面临的挑战是使用 Chromebook 和乐高积木一起编码和构建机器人。
 今年与我的团队一起工作真的很有趣，因为我们都有不同的使用机器人的方式。
 例如，我的小组中的一些成员想要建造一只机器狗，另一个小组想要建造机器企鹅。
 作为一个团队，我们必须决定如何创建不同的功能和附加组件，以提高机器人的功能。
 例如，我们为机器人添加了轮子和脚，以帮助我们更好地了解哪些功能可以帮助机器人更有效地移动。
 在这门课上，我感觉自己像一名工程师，因为我们面临着困难的情况或障碍，我们必须解决出现的不同问题。
 我们将通过实验并与班上其他小组讨论来解决这些问题。
 当我们克服这些挑战时，它会给我们一种成就感。
 我真的很喜欢在学校与机器人一起工作，并且迫不及待地想在未来使用我的编码技能。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3149.158s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 米姆布罗·因托帕。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3154.286s">[John Intoppa]</a>: 极好的。
 我只是想感谢你们两位通过这个项目来谈论你们的经历。
 你知道，我很喜欢这些举措，你知道，当我上小学时，就像是这样，然后就是，你知道，乐高头脑风暴，看到它在中学发展成如此大的东西绝对是令人惊奇的。
 好吧，你自己说过，即使你最终没有成为一名程序员，你也知道，世界生活和现实生活中有如此多的应用程序，你知道，这是一种不同的思维方式。
 这是一种不同的逻辑感觉。
 这是解释数据和情况的不同方式。
 即使不编码，
 它仍然可以帮助您作为个人发展并适应学校系统。
 它为您提供了这样做的实践经验，这很棒。
 阿里，你也说了同样的话。
 阿里，我只想说，我听说最后一个来自梅德福公立学校系统的人想为美国宇航局工作，最终成为黑洞摄影团队中最年轻的人。
 因此，请保持这个梦想远大，因为您可以成为那样的人。
 你可能会的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3218.542s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 卢索议员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3222.905s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 谢谢。
 我没想到我会是下一个。
 对不起。
 我是一名 Python 程序员，我会这样说，我在 Dana Farber 癌症研究所工作，并且
 许多不是程序员的人都使用它。
 因此，我认为如果您可以自己编写代码来解决某些问题而不是将其委托给其他人，那么您在任何领域都将拥有巨大的优势。
 所以不要仅仅因为你不想成为一名程序员就认为这不是你的未来。
 因为能够做到这一点将对您有很大帮助，即使这不是您的日常工作。
 所以这很令人兴奋。
 我希望我们小时候就有这个。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3264.487s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢。
 我认识格雷厄姆委员，所以我们会将其交给我们的学生代表。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3270.712s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 谢谢。
 感谢您将其纳入轮换中，因为当我们完成所有时间表更改并提出挑战课程的概念时，可以理解的是，对于它会是什么样子以及它会是什么样子存在很多疑问。
 当你以前从未做过或没有任何参考资料时，很难理解改变。
 所以我真的很高兴知道实践中发生了什么，因为我认为这就是高中所缺少的兴奋。
 在我看来，有两个不再上高中的孩子，他们回家谈论他们的课程以及发生在他们身上的酷事，但这对于高中来说似乎是一件特别的事情，需要真正思考并开始接受我们以 CCSR 保留的方式谈论的基于项目的学习的所有这些方面。
 基于项目的学习并不是
 预留给放学后有时间做的事情。
 它应该成为你每天所做的事情的一部分。
 所以我很高兴听到你说，我们正在学习团队合作，因为你猜怎么着？
 这就是你将永远做的事情。
 所以一切都很棒。
 感谢你们今晚过来告诉我们你们的课程。
 看到这些事情的实际应用确实很有帮助。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3362.827s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢你，格雷厄姆会员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3368.513s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 我只是想说，作为梅德福高中机器人和工程研讨会以及我们的水下设计项目“Sunk Robotics”的成员，我只想说，知道在这方面已经制定了这样的道路，这是非常有启发性的，我们很高兴在一四年左右的时间内见到你，因为真的感觉你正在为这方面的成功奠定基础。
 如果您需要帮助或想要开始，请给我们发送电子邮件，我们一定可以为您提供帮助。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3404.824s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢。
 赖因菲尔德议员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3406.085s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 我再次感谢您的分享。
 我想知道您能否给我们一些建议，告诉我们我们将来可以做些什么来做好准备
 考虑到这一点，你希望下一步去哪里，不是就个人而言，而是就课堂上接下来发生的事情而言？
 你们中有人吗？
 这并不是要让你陷入困境。
 是的，那么我们能做什么呢？
 不，当然。
 梅德福公立学校可以采取哪些措施来让您做好应对这些挑战的准备？您希望看到它们下一步走向何方？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3448.591s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 我认为梅德福公立学校无法为我们做太多准备，因为显然时间表的变化是新的。
 我觉得如果我们能够在未来巩固它，显然有一些问题需要解决，因为这个项目已经成为，我们就像美国第二所利用这个项目的学校。
 显然存在一些问题，我认为包括解决这些问题。
 有时一两个词会被误译并且没有意义。
 或者有时代码不会让您通过并且不会告诉您原因。
 因此，一旦所有这些小问题得到解决，我认为这将是这些项目未来的下一步（如果有意义的话）。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3498.501s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 是的。
 谢谢。
 这真的很有用。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3502.284s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 是的，我想说确实没有太多，因为它是一个新程序，但就像你说的，有几次代码没有让你通过，但你做的一切都是正确的，所以是的，我觉得只有在他们修复它并且它是完美的之后。
 我真的很喜欢上这门课。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3523.708s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 极好的。
 我很高兴听到这个消息。
 我希望您告诉您的老师我们可以做些什么来更好地支持他们。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=3826.043s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Thank you.
 Okay, well, good evening to the mayor, the interim superintendent and members of the school committee.
 Thank you for having me.
 My name is Kevin Provencher.
 I'm an architect and president of Habib and Associates Architects.
 We've been working with public schools in Massachusetts for the past 27 years.
 And this year we were asked by Medford Public Schools to prepare a facilities condition assessment for the five elementary and middle schools, Brooks, Missittuc, Roberts, Andrews and McGlynn.
 We've prepared a great many of these.
 And the districts that we've worked with have found them to be an extremely useful capital planning tool.
 And I'm hoping that you'll find the same results here tonight.
 If you've had a chance to review the full report, and I understand that you haven't had it for very long,
 But there's a great deal of detail in there we won't be able to get to that depth tonight.
 So I'm going to try to give you an overview of the process, how we work, how we collect the information, and how we arrive at some of the conclusions that I think will be helpful.
 So there's a great number of people that are involved in putting one of these things together.
 But I think the most successful results are always when we get a high level of participation from the school department.
 And that was the case here.
 All of the school principals and the custodial staff, in addition to the facility staff,
 All participated, and it's a very important part of the process.
 If we don't have access to these people, there's a lot of information that we simply just can't collect.
 And so we're very grateful for that.
 Our team consisted of myself as the project manager and my coworkers.
 And we also had a team of consulting engineers from GGD who joined us on our tours and evaluated the mechanical, electrical and the fire protection systems as well.
 So we have a good deal of expertise on the team.
 So just a little bit about the process and the purpose or the why we do this.
 Very simply put, we describe the current conditions that we observe at the schools.
 And taking those observations, we set priorities and make recommendations of things that we think need to be addressed, things that need to be repaired, replaced, and then we provide budget estimates for those items.
 And as I mentioned earlier, those cost estimate supports the development of the capital plan.
 So the scope of the process, we start with reviewing the concerns with the facilities staff, including the chief operations officer, the director of the buildings and grounds, John McLaughlin, and the head custodians that I mentioned a bit earlier.
 Principals also provide us with some good detail of things that they want us to know.
 We tour all of the schools and we visit as many of the interior spaces as we can.
 That took place over the February break when students were not in the building.
 So it gives us a lot of access that we can't get at any other time of the year.
 We don't open every locked door, look in every closet or under every rug, but it's really more of a high level overview of what we see.
 We identify the deficiencies in the materials and the systems that we would recommend for repair or replacement.
 We prepare work items for each of those observations, and we assign each of those a priority, which I'll talk about in a little bit more detail in a few minutes.
 We estimate the quantities involved, and we assigned unit costs to those quantities, which help us to calculate the total cost per each work item.
 And that includes soft costs and escalation.
 And I'll explain what that part means in a later slide.
 So in summary, the method, the assessment is based on our visual inspection and our observations of what we can see.
 We rely on those interviews that I mentioned.
 We also have access to the original construction drawings.
 These schools are relatively new compared to other schools in the Commonwealth.
 And all of those construction drawings were available to us, which provide us with a lot of detail.
 We review the buildings and the systems in their entirety.
 And again, we identify those deficiencies and they're typically deficiencies that are related to the age of the building or the useful life, things that should be considered for replacement for lifecycle costing and 21st century learning practices.
 So each of the work items, we assign a priority.
 We call them scope categories.
 And so for this assessment, we had three scopes in order of priority.
 Scope number one are items that are necessary but not yet critical.
 And what I mean by that is
 If you had a critical item that needs to be addressed, you would have addressed it already because that's something that's, you know, it's an emergency or something that has to be addressed immediately.
 We didn't see any of that in our assessment, which is good.
 But these are items that will deteriorate predictably.
 and could involve some downtime if things needed to be shut down to make a repair.
 And these are things that will continue to deteriorate over time and become more and more expensive to address if deferred.
 The second scope category
 are the things that we recommend, and these are things that are needed immediately, but are sort of in that mid-range, which are improvements that school departments should consider to be making based on the age of the building, the systems, and the equipment, and the expected lifespan of that.
 Scope three is the third and last priority category.
 And this category is reserved for items that may not comply with current codes and regulations.
 And the best examples that I can give you are the accessibility regulations and fire sprinklers.
 And so in the Commonwealth, we have laws and regulations
 that stipulate if a significant amount of work or if a major renovation is done to a building, there are some triggers that require upgrading for fire sprinklers and for incremental compliance with accessibility regulations.
 All of these buildings have fire sprinklers, so that's not an issue here.
 And then there were some minor accessibility items that we did
 Note, there's nothing that is required to be done now.
 But as I mentioned, if there were other work being performed in the future of a certain dollar value, those items may need to be corrected.
 And then finally, for scope category number three, this also includes building systems or equipment that are approaching the end of their service life.
 And the useful service life is the point in time where the costs of continued maintenance and repair will start to outweigh the cost of simply just replacing the equipment or the item.
 We can go to the next.
 I think we need to flip back on one.
 So the work items are compiled into one of five different assessment categories, the first one being the site.
 And so these are all the areas that are outside of the building, the parking areas, the walkways, the landscaping, the playgrounds, et cetera, the storm drainage.
 The second category is the building envelope.
 So these are the walls, the roof, the doors, the windows, and so forth.
 Building interiors are fairly self-explanatory.
 It's all the things that we see right here in this room, the floor finishes, the ceilings, the walls, accessibility items when they're there, doors, toilet rooms, and so forth.
 Mechanical systems include our domestic plumbing systems, our fire protection systems, gas, heating, ventilation, air conditioning.
 And the electrical systems would include the main electrical service, all of the distribution wiring, panel boards, fire alarm system, lighting,
 emergency lighting and egress, communication systems such as phones, paging systems, clock and bell systems, security, computer networking, switches, data wiring, and so forth.
 Next one.
 Okay.
 I wanna be able to look at my,
 slide a little closer.
 So there is a page very similar to this one, which you'll find in the complete report, which is an explanation of how to read the assessment.
 So what this shows is an example of a typical work item that you will find in the assessment.
 And there are dozens of these.
 This example is from Misutak.
 And it's the first item in the site category.
 And it describes potholes, cracking at the paving in the parking lot.
 The recommendation here is to repave
 parking lot and to provide new painted striping.
 It's a pretty typical item that we see everywhere.
 The quantity of this particular item is approaching 20,000 square feet.
 The unit cost that we assigned to this item is $11.90.
 So multiply that gives us a total of almost $237,000.
 And then we apply the soft costs.
 So these are the indirect costs that would include the district's administration costs, contingencies, architectural and engineering fees.
 And that's a simple multiplier of 30%.
 So we add 30% on top of those construction costs to get a total cost to address that particular item.
 And then we assign that item into a scope category that I described earlier.
 And this item we assign to scope category two.
 It's worth noting here that each of the scope categories has a timeline associated to it.
 So for this assessment, scope one are items that are recommended to be addressed within two years.
 Scope number two, two to five years, and scope number three is five years and beyond.
 Considering that these items will all be addressed at some point in the future, we also have to account for escalation in construction costs.
 And I'll show you on a later slide on how those are applied.
 But at the moment, we've been using about 5% compounded on an annual basis.
 It has been higher.
 And during COVID, it was
 significantly higher.
 Historically, it's been around 4%, but based on current economic conditions, it's about 5%.
 That's what we've been seeing.
 So just a very quick snapshot of each of the schools with some basic data.
 You can see that the construction dates are all within a couple of years of each other from 2001 to 2003.
 So all built at relatively the same time.
 Brooks is three stories at 95,000 square feet.
 Missittuck
 four stories, a little bit smaller, about 93,000.
 Roberts, also four stories and about 95,000 square feet.
 Andrews, middle, a bit bigger, 104,000 square feet.
 And McGlynn, the largest of the group at 186,000 square feet.
 So all together,
 This is almost 574,000 square feet.
 And be mindful of the size of the school.
 I would just mention that this total does not include the high school Curtis Tops or any of the other buildings in the school system.
 Okay, so you'll also see this table in the full report, the executive summary.
 Now, this is the table that totals all of the work items that were identified for each of the schools and all of the scope categories for each.
 So reading left to right,
 The total of the scope categories for each school is in the column on the right hand side, and reading top to bottom are the totals for each scope category.
 So our highest priority category is scope one, and we identified almost $17 million of work.
 Scope two, 39.2 million, and scope three,
 11.8 million approximately.
 So across the bottom of the table, you'll see the inflation factor at 5% so compounded on an annual basis.
 For scope one, two years, it's 18.6.
 Scope two, at five years, 50 million.
 Scope three, also at five years, 15 million.
 So with escalation, all work included, everything that was identified for this report, it totals 83.7 million.
 Okay, so I'll give you some idea of some of the things that without going into too much detail of some of the typical things that we found in our assessment.
 Most of the observations were due to deterioration because of age and deferred maintenance.
 And it was, I think, pretty typical or average of any school of this age, approximately 20, 23 years, 25 years.
 So no real surprises there and no real big concerns either.
 On the site, on every location, we noticed issues with pavements, the walkways and curbs, some issues with chain link fences, which are perhaps less critical, but these are items that we want to pay attention to because they are potential safety and tripping hazards and always find a high priority in our reports.
 The building envelope, all of the roofs are a combination of membrane and shingle, mostly membrane, and they are all past their warranty.
 and they are at the age where they should strongly be considered for replacement.
 Roofs are absolutely critical.
 Once they start leaking, it's hard to get them to stop.
 And they cause a lot of problems and potentially some environmental problems if left for long enough.
 We did a more of a detailed analysis of the roofs and the exterior walls, which was prepared in support of the preparation of the statement of interest to the MSBA.
 And Ken has told me that recently the MSBA toured Brooks Roberts and
 Mr. Tuck and took a look at those roofs and they will be considered for inclusion.
 in the MSBA's accelerated repair program, which is good.
 It's good to be in the MSBA pipeline.
 Otherwise, the exterior walls of all these schools are some combination of brick or concrete block.
 There's some minor cracking, some sealants that need to be addressed.
 Nothing really serious or of great concern.
 A few issues with windows.
 The windows are all original.
 Some of the glazing units in the windows have failed, which means the perimeter seal has failed and condensation is inside the glass.
 And that's that milky appearance that you see sometimes.
 It looks like it's fogged up.
 And those can be replaced.
 You do not have to replace the entire window unit to address that.
 Otherwise, issues with exterior doors and frames, rust buildup, very, very common, you know, due to exposure to the elements, but also there's a lot of heavy salting and ice melt that we have in front of the entrances.
 And so that really accelerates the corrosion.
 And that's very common.
 We see that at almost every school that we look at.
 Interiors, no great surprises.
 The deterioration there is very predictable.
 Carpets get worn out.
 Walls get scuffed.
 Ceiling tiles get stained.
 The flooring, there's a lot of VCT, vinyl tile.
 Every school has it.
 There's a couple of areas of concern there.
 Despite all of the cleaning and the waxing, the Brooks and Missittuck in particular appear to have an issue on the ground floor.
 So the ground floor is a concrete slab on grade.
 And there's a lot of failure in both of those.
 Missittuck being, I think, significantly worse than Brooks.
 Brooks is also an issue.
 So the tiles are cracking, they're popping up, they're chipping, and just coming up all over.
 So there's something going on there and the cause of that is something that goes beyond the scope of this exercise, but
 It could be an issue related to having excessive moisture in the floor slab or perhaps a structural issue where the slab is moving due to unstable soils.
 There would be some further testing and investigation, I think, to determine exactly what is going on there.
 It can be a potential tripping or safety hazard.
 So we recommend that that be addressed.
 Toilet rooms, I mean, we see all of the things that we expect to see in the toilet rooms.
 Typically the toilet partitions in most cases need to be replaced.
 Fixtures oftentimes need to be replaced as well.
 The mechanical systems, so these include all of the HVAC equipment and the controls.
 We do know that the equipment and the controls are currently being replaced.
 It's ongoing at Andrews and McGlynn.
 So we did not evaluate that.
 That's being addressed in another project.
 But we did look at everything else.
 All the major pieces of equipment are approaching the end of their useful service life.
 The boilers, the chillers, the circulator pumps, air handlers, unit ventilators are the things that we see in the classrooms that are underneath the windows.
 condensers and exhaust fans.
 So these are fairly costly pieces of equipment.
 But as I mentioned earlier, at some point, the cost of maintenance and repair will begin to eclipse the cost of replacement.
 So just keep that in mind when you're considering your capital plan.
 Electrical systems, there really wasn't anything urgent that we saw there and no major concerns.
 The electrical switchgear and the standby generators, every school has them.
 Those are critical pieces of equipment and need to be monitored very carefully, especially the standby generator needs regular maintenance and exercise.
 Fire alarm systems should always be maintained and upgraded and tested.
 There are some opportunities for improvements with some of the communication systems, such as a voice over IP telephone system or replacement of the paging in the time clock systems, which are fairly obsolete.
 And then finally, security is always a primary concern and any opportunities to improve security at building entrances for access control is always encouraged.
 So just to wrap things up, I find it's helpful to remind ourselves sometimes of why we do this.
 How do we support the goals
 of the schools and the facilities.
 And it's really what it comes down to is the learning environment.
 We wanna provide the best learning environment that we can for our students.
 And if there are problems with the building that compromise that learning environment, if they compromise safety, if they compromise security, those are the things that should always be top priority.
 We also look for opportunities to decrease operating and lifecycle costs for the school district and any improvements that can be made to the operations and maintenance.
 And finally, any opportunity to reduce energy costs by replacing equipment with more efficient equipment can also contribute to ongoing cost savings.
 So that's what we have.
 I hope that was helpful.
 If you do have the opportunity to review the full report, there's a lot more detail in there.
 And if there are any questions now, I can try to answer those.
 Or Ken, I don't know if you had anything else that you wanted to add to that.
 Member Ruseau.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5438.067s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 谢谢你。
 我很高兴我们没有经历一切。
 实际报告。
 我们可以在这里待一整夜。
 150 页。
 是的，这将是一个漫长的夜晚。
 我不介意晚上睡得很晚，但睡得不多。
 你说考虑到年龄，事情并不太令人惊讶，但我意识到这是一个估计，但其中年龄与延期维护的百分比是多少？
 和
 我们之所以来这里是因为 10% 的延期维护，还是 80%？
 我知道我要的是一个你没有的确切数字。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5478.526s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 是的，我们不会用这些术语来审查它，但如果我不得不猜测的话，可能是 80-20 有利于年龄。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5489.758s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 所以年龄是
 80 年代。
 是的。
 啊，这比我想象的要好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5495.568s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 他比你好吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5497.209s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 好吧，我本来以为是这样。
 因为当我加入学校委员会时，我们的维护预算约为 0.03 美元。
 这是夸张的说法。
 不管怎样，电气系统，我认为我们不能做电磁炉，因为我们没有足够的电力。
 所以当你说那里的事情真的很好时，那就真的很好。
 维持现状，对吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5524.305s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 是的。
 因此，如果您想引入其他设备导致电力负荷增加，并不一定意味着建筑物无法承受。
 它只是意味着必须对其进行检查。
 那里很可能还有一些额外的容量。
 我应该注意到所有的照明都得到了改善。
 LED 代表着电能使用量的普遍减少。
 所以那里必须有一些额外的容量。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5561.014s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 是的，我们买了电磁炉，不得不退货，因为街上没有足够的电。
 然后我认为建筑物也没有足够的能力来处理它，因为它们消耗大量的能源。
 但我想知道现状是否如所决定的那样……是的。
 好的。
 你提到时钟已经过时了。
 我想那里一定有一些过去的老钟表……
 百万年前，因为我们有一个全新的时钟系统，实际上已经有两个月了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5591.628s">[Kenneth Lord]</a>: 指的是教室对讲和时钟系统，而不是时钟系统。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5596.55s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 哦。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5596.65s">[Kenneth Lord]</a>: 这是门铃，对讲系统。
 我明白。
 该系统是建筑物的原创系统。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5600.632s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 好的，谢谢。
 是的，我认为任何学校都没有正确的时钟。
 世界上的学校有正确的时钟吗？
 不管怎样，一切都很好，谢谢。
 这更有意义。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5611.958s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢小熊会员。
 格雷厄姆议员？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5616.707s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我认为我的问题更多是针对肯的，但我认为这是一条评论。
 当我们推进资本规划时，这些信息将非常有用。
 学校委员会这里的季节，所以这些会议已经安排在 11 月，我们将在肯和我一直在联系如何将这些信息整合到将提交给学校委员会的资本规划中。
 所以这一切都在进行中，但是。
 我想我遇到的另一类问题是，我们是否拥有这个操作英雄系统，从系统的角度来看，我现在可以称之为婴儿，它的使用量正在增加，但尚未达到全速，在我看来，所有这些东西都将被添加到这个系统中，以便我们可以跟踪何时完成它们，而不是获取 150 页的报告等等。
 手动追踪，你也是这么想的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5678.277s">[Kenneth Lord]</a>: 是的，这里有几类东西。
 我们将通过运营预算、内部团队或与 DPW 合作或类似的方式来完成一些事情。
 有些事情我们将通过较小的项目在我们的运营预算范围内完成，有些事情我们需要寻求资本融资。
 根据这些项目的级别，它们将在不同的区域投入运行，我们现有的系统需要在这里进行分类，以便我们可以开始构建驱动所有这一切的预防性维护计划。
 因此，我们的第一个重大推动将是所有正在安装的新东西，卢林和安德鲁正在确保对所有预防性维护周期进行正确编目，这些周期会自动生成我们可以与我们自己的团队解决或分配给承包商的票证。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5723.573s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 这一切听起来都很棒，我很期待所有这些工作。
 显然，我们将收集大量此类信息并讨论资本计划。
 但我希望我们报告其中一些工作的总体进展，因为我认为，正如我所说，其中一些事情将会完成，因为我们将在我们的常规预算过程中完成它们。
 我希望我们能够量化这一点。
 我的清单上有 20 件物品，我们做了 5 件，占总数的 5%，因为我认为
 你知道，这个数字很大，这里没有人对此感到太惊讶。
 我不是特别因为我们有五十万平方英尺的建筑物，我们有很多屋顶，很多锅炉，很多很多很多东西。
 然后所有这些东西就会积累起来，尤其是当它们都老了的时候。
 但我认为如果我们了解我们收到了这份报告将会有所帮助。
 我们在这方面取得了哪些进展？
 所以当人们说，好吧，我们给了他们很多钱。
 你用它做了什么？
 有一种简单的方法可以展示我们正在取得的进展，以及坦率地说，我们没有取得的进展。
 因为如果我们想取得重大进展，我们可能需要另一名维护技术人员。
 我们可能还需要两名维护人员。
 这些是我们需要进行的对话，但我们认为，如果我们想在这个清单上向前推进而不扰乱学生的学习，那么这就是我们所需要的。
 我认为对我们来说分析数据很重要，也许是在每个学年结束时或类似的预算时间。
 开始帮助社区了解我们正在取得的真正进展。
 我们正在取得巨大进步。
 我认为我们从未报告过这件事，主要是因为我们担心我们不会这样做。
 我认为无论我们是否是这样，我只是希望这个清晰的故事能够被公开，让我们所有人都能够证实这些事实。
 我的另一个问题是这种类型的评估应该定期进行。
 这是正确的吗？
 在每 X 年的一个周期中，您应该进行此类评估吗？这个数字是多少？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5860.543s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 我的意思是，我会推荐
 可能每五年进行一次。
 我的意思是，我认为这可能取决于后者。
 当然。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5876.437s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 所以第一个永远是最糟糕的，对吧？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5879.238s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 运气好的话。
 但是，你知道，本次评估确定的时间段
 长达五年。
 确实没那么长。
 我们时不时地会收到更长期限（10 年、15 年）的请求。
 所以简短的答案是：如果报告为期五年，那么您应该每五年做一次。
 我认为它可能是最具攻击性的，可能接近 10。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5914.529s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 好的，太好了。
 谢谢。
 奥拉帕德副手，然后是赖因菲尔德副手。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5924.622s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 谢谢。
 为了跟进我同事的问题，您认为该设施的某些部分是否应该更定期地进行监控？
 那么，管道、暖通空调或电气安装，或者您认为我们应该普遍遵循相同的时间表，即 10 年建议还是 5 年建议（如果您想更加积极）？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5944.348s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 那么，该类别范围内的任何内容都将成为优先事项。
 这一类别的许多美元实际上来自这些上限。
 所以这可能应该是重中之重。
 参与 MSBA 流程是一个完美的开始方式。
 但任何导致水渗透的事情
 如果窗户开始漏水，如果屋顶变得更糟，那就是问题的开始。
 所以我会重点关注这些领域。
 这是一个有用的答案吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=5983.538s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 是的，那就完美了。
 好的。
 然后我对这个评估又产生了疑问。你知道，我还没有完全审阅这份150页的文件。
 但是，当谈到从当前的评估转向实际的原理图设计和招标流程时，您认为从我们现在所处的位置到开始招标的这一部分的典型时间表是什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6005.41s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 噢，孩子。
 是的，这可能是一个非常漫长的过程，具体取决于时间表。
 所以，你知道，一个小项目，你知道，我们可能会在六个月或更短的时间内启动并运行它。
 较大的项目可能需要一年或更长时间，具体取决于该市在许可证方面所需的审批级别。
 但这实际上只取决于项目的规模。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6036.652s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 我认为你所说的，我认为对我来说重要的是，委员会和可能正在倾听的公众，在大多数情况下，他们在这次评估中发现的事情，在有关学生安全或受影响的学生学习的设施方面没有出现重大的新担忧。
 因此，如果进入这部分比赛的过程较长，学生的安全不会受到影响，因为需要更长的时间。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6062.001s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 事实上，我们没有看到任何主要问题。
 正如我所提到的，我认为当我们开始谈话时，如果存在那么严重的问题，它们可能已经得到解决。
 所以不，我们什么也没看到。我认为这将是一个严重的问题。
 短期内的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6083.588s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 谢谢。
 然后最后一种问题评论，您在评估机械和电气系统的最后一部分中提到的有关维修成本的问题，您知道，最终可能会超过更换它的成本。
 是的。
 你能多谈谈这个吗？
 我知道社区对设施成本方面的总体情况有很多担忧。
 而且，你知道，我们正在讨论，你知道，一个新的翻新或
 梅德福新建高中，因此有很多关于短期成本与长期成本的讨论。
 我只知道你提到我想知道你是否有任何专业经验，知道这最终会在什么时候超过更换成本。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6123.283s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 是的。
 是的，我认为需要更深入的分析才能充分回答这个问题，但是
 我们熟悉生活循环的概念和存在的过程，考虑到机械设备的例子、设备的替代品和设备的能源经济问题。比较 isso com 操作人员对这些设备进行管理，但不进行替代。
 您可以从中得到一些非常好的结果。
 因此，我建议进行生命周期成本分析，这可能是最好的方法。
 谢谢。
 当然。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6176.257s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 莱因菲尔德成员？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6180.374s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 我有一个可能不公平的问题，因为您非常明确地指出，出于显而易见的原因，高中不在本分析的范围之内。
 但我很好奇，尤其是我们即将进行的可行性研究，这显然将由我们的 MSBA 完成。
 委员会和设计公司。
 这些数字、这些价值分配在多大程度上可以转化为像高中这样比这些建筑更古老的建筑？
 但我想知道我们可以在多大程度上看待这一点，并说我们是否在瓷砖、这些信封中看到了这些变化。
 挑战。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6223.0s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 如果可以的话，您是否想知道如果我们进行此类分析，是否可以将类似的成本应用于高中？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6231.662s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 是的，或者由于它是一座老建筑，它会明显更高吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6235.243s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 我预计，由于我们发现的建筑物的年龄，如果我们从每平方英尺的成本角度考虑，仅仅因为它的年龄，接近高中的费用会更高。
 我认为那栋建筑建于 1970 年，比我们这里的建筑古老得多。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6261.01s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 太好了，因为我认为社区将非常认真地研究我们如何管理我们的建筑物以及这对新建和翻新意味着什么。
 所以感谢您超出了范围。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6273.094s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 好的，不客气。谢谢。卢梭议员，然后转向梅格·梅奥-布朗博士的演讲。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6284.833s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 谢谢。
 我认为每年这个 5%，我们不做这项工作，价格和成本会上升是一个重要的考虑因素，特别是因为提案 2.5 意味着我们只能多获得 2.5%。
 于是我们就在洞里越陷越深。
 我只是看了这些数字：如果我们七年什么都不做，就会比我们所能支付的多花费 1500 万美元。
 不管怎样，我不认为我们有钱来支付大部分这些事情，但我认为重要的是要记住，你知道，这 1950 万或 1860 万用于外展，这些是我们应该做的事情。
 以及我们现在所处的 2026 财年。
 不适用于 EF27、EF28 和 EF29。
 这就是今年的工作。
 我不知道从哪里或者我们是否知道从哪里可以得到这笔钱。
 但如果我们今年不这样做，这一切加起来将超过一百万美元。
 明年将再增加一百万美元以上。
 与此同时，所有其他东西也将变得更加昂贵。
 一方面，我对这些数字并不感到惊讶。
 另一方面，我希望能有某种药物来帮助我停止过度换气，因为我的意思是，8300 万美元是我们整个学校的预算。
 而且每年都会有新的事情出现，这里面的五年，明年的这五年是我们的二到五年。
 之后还添加了一些内容。
 我真的很高兴看到这些数字，但我也认为它们不是基于拆掉屋顶并发现所有东西都漏水而得出的数字，你必须更换整个墙壁或其他疯狂的东西。
 所以这些是，
 更好的猜测，而不必侵入性地观察建筑物来弄清楚到底发生了什么。
 因此，在我看来，我将它们视为下限，因为我的意思是，我们已经经历了很多年所谓的延期维护，这只是说没有维护的另一种方式。
 我认为我们做得很好。
 最后，要达到规范要求某些 HVAC 系统必须在这些特定学校运行。
 而且，你知道，我们研究了其他学校，例如高中，我知道这不包括在内，但我们研究了改善学校的成本。
 一些建筑物的供暖系统，其中一些建筑物的供暖系统。
 事实证明，没有办法让它更便宜，因为它们已经很多年没有工作了。
 因此，它不可能比使用零能量更有效。
 我真的很担心这个数字很低，而且我们没有计划如何...我的意思是，我们今年就用完了所有的免费资金。
 明年，将没有更多的钱来支付这些费用。
 所以我有点害怕。
 我想我们很多人都是如此。
 我认为我们需要确保公众非常清楚地知道我们每年为学校提供的资金不足数千万美元。
 这太棒了，但我认为
 格雷厄姆议员关于实现这一目标的论点。
 我认为这应该出现在我们的网站上，并应该显示今年的进展。
 我认为这应该表明我们每年都没有取得进展。
 我们向洞深处走去。
 我不知道如何用图形来表示，但这些东西会继续增加，我们花的钱会比增加的少。
 这就是为什么我要感谢您的报告。
 现在我睡不着了。
 对不起。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6537.969s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 米姆布罗·因托帕。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6540.151s">[John Intoppa]</a>: 感谢您将这份报告汇总到本摘要中。
 查看故障非常有用。
 从可访问性需求的角度来看，从现在需要做的事情、需要做的事情、不能再推迟的事情，以及也许不需要立即解决的事情来看，这确实很有帮助。
 我不知道我为什么这样
 回到这个问题，但是我们的窗户都是双层玻璃窗吗？
 是的，它们有双层隔热层。
 那么我们是否必须将它们重新气化以再次绝缘或避免冷凝？
 我的意思是，我知道我们必须对它们进行监管，但我们是否必须同时进行这一过程，或者从这个意义上说它们仍然是全面的？
 这是一个非常具体的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6586.334s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 要相信，
 大多数窗户都有两个窗框，顶部和底部。
 因此，每个部分都有一个玻璃单元。
 例如，其中一副眼镜可能出现故障。
 然后，您所要做的就是拆下玻璃单元并更换新的。
 噢，难以置信。
 是的，这是一件非常简单的事情。
 合法的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=6615.608s">[John Intoppa]</a>: 出色的。
 是的。
 我想我还想强调这一点，你知道，因为我们正在推迟维护方面提出要点，并且所有这些要谈论的事情，你知道，我们必须拿出钱来解决问题。
 我们还必须修复它们。
 好的。
 我们必须正确地做到这一点。
 我们无法让产品变得更便宜，因为 C3 就是这样。
 我们建造了C3。
 我们游行C3。
 C3很棒。
 这是新的科学翼。
 我们将会玩得很开心。
 这将会非常棒。
 然后，一年后，屋顶漏水。
 好的。
 太可怕了。
 刚装修完的教室里不应该有四个垃圾桶什么的。
 因此，确实要确保，是的​​，正如卢梭议员所说，当我们拆除屋顶时，我们需要确保，正如您提到的，事情会变得更糟。
 有时，一处裂缝会引发几处裂缝，进水。
 不幸的是，当谈到这些事情时，水才是真正的敌人。
 但要确保你知道我们没有把自己置于我们花钱的另一种情况，我不是委员会成员，我当时在读高中，我们花了多少钱去看三个只是为了可能把事情搞砸，特别是在科学翼，污染物你好。
 可能会受到影响。
 因此，为了确保我们使用正确的材料，我们使用了对材料有了解的正确人员，因为我们不想更换瓷砖然后踩到它们导致它们破裂或使用错误的粘合剂。
 这发生了，那也发生了。
 再说一次，我不想推测我们会变得更便宜，或者推测任何事情，但只是说我们需要确保，如果我们要花这笔钱，我们不妨花更多。
 因为如果它坏了，我们将不得不花更多的钱。
 它只会更多。
 你知道，你口袋里的东西越多，花费就越多，我们第一次做的事情不如第二次清理烂摊子好。
 所以谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=7134.273s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  Thank you.
 So good evening, Madam Mayor and esteemed members of the school committee.
 I'm quite honored to be presenting my interim findings as they are to date.
 So when I began my tenure as interim superintendent eight months ago I did so with deep gratitude and a strong sense of purpose as someone who grew up in Medford, and is proud to have been educated through its public schools, serving this community has been both a personal honor and a professional privilege.
 Over these past months, I've had the opportunity to view the district through a new lens, as I listened closely, engaged with stakeholders, and learned from the diverse perspectives that define our school communities.
 Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of our district's many strengths, as well as areas where continued focus and alignment are needed.
 So this report captures that learning and this reflection.
 I think it's important to also note that the insights that were gleaned from this process will inform our collective work ahead as we develop a cohesive district strategic plan designed to advance belonging, equity, and excellence for Medford Public Schools.
 So part of this was taken from the transition plan that I presented to this body in January, but I'm calling it the transition slash entry plan since I have been in Medford Public Schools for 29 years.
 But this just highlights a little bit of the purpose of that plan.
 So first and foremost, it was to maintain consistency and calm in a moment of transition.
 It was to inform the school community about transition activities and to maintain open communication.
 Part of that was strengthening the relationships that I had already had with staff, with families, with caregivers, with students.
 It was to also look at Medford Public Schools in a new lens and to identify strengths and areas of focus that will help us inform our work moving ahead.
 and it was to outline the next steps of our work.
 So these are the buckets of work that I've been doing since January of 2025.
 So part of this process included gathering stakeholder voice and input.
 So I facilitated over 30 listening sessions at school communities via Zoom.
 I met with caregivers, I met with staff.
 I attended and participated in district and community events.
 district wide school and leadership meetings, and I reviewed survey data.
 I do think it's very critical and important to mention that in this bucket of work, I would say that I did not
 gather a really diverse input from our diverse community of Medford.
 I would say that moving forward and to inform the work that we have to do for the strategic plan, I think it's really critical to make sure that we are meeting people where they're at.
 Though I offered multiple modalities in order for people to participate, it still wasn't representative of what Medford is today.
 The other bucket of work that informed this was observing in schools, one of my favorite things.
 But to date, between January and today, I've conducted over 200 classroom visits and observations.
 And I've reviewed that data with our senior leadership and school leadership as well.
 I also worked to enhance my understanding of district operations.
 I think we know my background here in Medford.
 I've gone from being an educator to a school leader, to the assistant superintendent for elementary schools, to the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.
 So operations was something I needed to lean into and build that muscle.
 And so what I did in that area was held a lot of meetings
 with finance, facilities, IT, athletics, and community schools.
 I reviewed overall functioning and current structures.
 And a lot of that led me to making sure that we had positions in place that could help lead a lot of that work.
 And so hiring key personnel in these areas to assist the overall functioning of the district, the support needs, the structure and the growth was critical.
 I think you saw a little snapshot this evening for the chief operations officer position that was created that has been tremendous in establishing much needed structure, which we'll get to, but in the areas of operations within the city of Medford, the Medford Public Schools.
 And then the last area was to advance
 and establish shared understanding, alignment, and next steps.
 So really, through all of this information that I was gathering, establishing and enhancing district organizations, systems, and structures was and is and always will be critical, continuing instructional alignment that has already been in progress, and informing the upcoming strategic plan.
 So I think it's important to give a little bit of reminder or context about what we've done so far and where we have come.
 So since being, I would say, I'll go back to 2022 was the time in which my position shifted from the assistant superintendent of elementary to the assistant superintendent of academics and instruction.
 That position is critical to see the vertical alignment of our academics and our instruction district wide, which we did not have that lens before.
 That was a big learning year for me.
 And that was really the year where I had to do a lot of learning at the secondary level in a lot of middle school and high school classrooms.
 And there were a lot of aha moments during that year.
 And that was really the year that we decided that we needed to be grounding our work in an instructional vision.
 Because it didn't matter if I was in a kindergarten classroom or in AP
 physics.
 Standard one content may look different, but how we're teaching all students and the learning environment we're creating for students, that mattered district wide.
 So that instructional alignment kind of began, I would say, in 2022.
 That summer, which was 2023, Medford Public Schools attended the Department of Education's first Instructional Leadership Institute.
 We were lucky that one was housed at Tufts.
 We didn't have far to drive.
 But that learning for us as a district instructional leadership team was very profound.
 That's where we grounded in a lot of work that helped us inform our instructional practices.
 In combination, around that same time, as this body may remember, we had Spring Point, which is, and we had DESE Air Report come.
 Those were two neutral reports that spoke about the instruction that our students are experiencing every day.
 That work, along with what we received in terms of professional development, really began to our work in looking at what is the student experience?
 What are we doing for our planning and for our instruction?
 That came with us to the development of the instructional plan.
 That work was done collaboratively with school leaders, with department leaders, with teachers.
 And I know that I have presented on this work before to this body, but I think it's very important to remember that this work was aligned to the Department of Education's expectations for the instructional vision of districts.
 And it also is where our core values came from.
 This work also encompassed our access and opportunity for all.
 So when we were at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Instructional Institute over the summer, we were introduced on a district level to the opportunity myth.
 which is TNTPs, the new teacher project, well-researched, study on how students, even though we're saying that we're providing grade level content, they're just not meeting grade level standards, and why is that?
 We really dug in to this research as a district team.
 And teachers, we created a professional development series that lasted the year.
 and teachers received that.
 This past year in 2024, 2025, we brought on some sustained coaching for our staff.
 We've brought on through the Barr Foundation, Unbound Ed, Lynch Leadership Academy, and we've continued our partnership with Hill for Literacy since 2019, I believe.
 All of this work has come together
 in our advancement of what we want to see the student experience be.
 Part of this work also is creating aligned schedules and walkthrough tools so that our school leaders and our department leaders are coming together and not just like coalescing, but aligning in what we want to see in classrooms.
 And through this work, as we've explained before, we also at the secondary level, our teachers are
 We are making sure that our teachers are planning for GLEAM instruction, which means they are planning so that their lessons are grade level, engaging, affirming, and meaningful to our students.
 Thank you.
 So I thought it would be very fitting and really help us continue the work that we have been doing thus far in this district to continue the work
 with TNTP's national framework, their next year, they went from the opportunity myth to opportunity makers.
 And so this framework, my findings are going to be grounded in this framework of belonging, consistency, and coherence.
 In everything that I've gathered, this frame not only fits the work we've currently been doing, but also fits the work that we have to do.
 It is aligned completely with our instructional vision and I think would be a great launch for the work that we have upcoming for our strategic plan.
 So just to capture before we move on, the three pillars.
 Belonging is just to make sure every student feels known, safe, and valued, and my findings will reflect that.
 Consistency, every student experiences high-quality, grade-level learning in a safe, well-maintained environment.
 And the coherence is that every system, from instruction to communication to facilities, works together to support learning.
 These are overall just highlights of the strengths and areas for growth that I found in gathering all of this information.
 Our strengths, we have engaged and supportive stakeholders.
 I think you can see it in the Mustang moment.
 I think you can see it with our student representatives.
 From our students to our educators, to our staff, to our caregivers, to our community, and to our city partners, we have engaged and supportive stakeholders.
 We are very lucky that we are in a system where we have so much support.
 Our students represent diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and talents.
 That's an asset.
 We have deep community commitment to students' success and well-being.
 Over and over again, through anecdotes, through data, there are so many examples of how the community rallies to support our students and our staff and our communities.
 And it's just a wonderful part of Medford Public Schools.
 And another strength is our shared value for inclusion, equity, safety and excellence, which we see on a continuous basis, even here during these meetings with your resolutions and your support for the work that we're doing.
 Areas of growth.
 for the previous report.
 Maintenance of facilities and security upgrades.
 We're going to talk about some of this.
 There is work ongoing.
 There's work still to be done, but that is an area of growth for us.
 Alignment and coherence of communication.
 So I think this one, there was a wide spectrum of input that I received during my time gathering information, but things that rose to the top and continuously were just the alignment of school to school, that communication varies widely.
 Classroom communication methods and I would say schedule also varies.
 Athletic communication and just
 overall communication chain.
 The other piece of area for growth is capacity expansion of the afterschool program.
 which we've been doing consistently, but there is still a lot of work to be done.
 Diversifying our educator staffing.
 That is a big growth area for us.
 I'll talk a little bit about that, but that is work that needs to be prioritized.
 Our students need to see representation in their classrooms and in the hallways.
 And then creating more visible and supportive opportunities for neurodivergent and LGBTQ plus students.
 That also came up in a lot of my community meetings, making sure that all of our students can visibly see the supports that Medford Public Schools is offering them and provides for them.
 So the first pillar is belonging.
 And that means knowing, supporting, and growing every one of our students.
 So strengths in this pillar were strong relationships among educators, students, and families, a shared value for inclusion and equity, and deep community connection and pride.
 The reason why the pillar of belonging is so critical is because it's not something we feel, it's something we build.
 When schools design systems, environments, and routines that are safe, inclusive, and well-cared for, they send a powerful message that everyone matters here.
 Through these structural commitments, everyone is supported to grow, achieve, and believe in their own success.
 The next slide is going to detail some of the focus areas and a little bit of the action items.
 And I will narrate a little bit, some that have been already in progress, some that are yet to come.
 So the first focus area for belonging is expand student voice and opportunities for leadership.
 Now the current implementation of the instructional vision focuses on that.
 And that GLEAM framework that educators are following also focuses on that.
 We want to make sure that we're allowing a lot more opportunity for student voice in classrooms.
 through the feedback we've received from neutral observations to school and district leadership observations, we need to capitalize a little bit more on the amount of time and access students have for voice in classrooms.
 The instructional vision is providing us that pathway, and we're working on aligned professional development and observational feedback.
 Fidelity to social emotional learning practices that are already in place is also critical to this work, which is responsive classroom and restorative practices.
 Some of what we're really working on is pushing the restorative practices piece a little bit more.
 It's responsive classroom is a little bit, has more of a solid footing at the elementary level, but restorative practices is a little bit of a growing edge right now.
 Dr. Talbot has made sure that everyone has access to that high-quality text.
 We are making sure that we're modeling some of this at district leadership meetings, but that is work that is ongoing to make sure we have refreshers in place for our teachers.
 And then the Mustang moment, I think, is a really great example of how we are modeling elevating that student voice and why it is so important for the community to hear and just making sure that that transcends into all areas for students.
 Another focus area is to build structures that help every student and staff and caregiver feel seen, heard, valued, and supported.
 I think structure is probably going to be a big thread that you see throughout this report.
 First and foremost, I think the foundation of all of this was the collective charge this year was on belonging.
 And so we really want to make sure that students feel that sense in their learning environments so that they feel safe enough to learn and challenge themselves.
 But what we want to make sure is that connection to how
 making sure we're holding rigor and expectations for students is also showing them that they belong.
 Review of engagement strategies across school communities.
 So this is work that we have started but is also ongoing.
 So continued support for our LGBTQ plus student groups and increased visibility initiatives.
 Some of those conversations have started.
 They 100% will be continuing and need to be prioritized.
 We are in the process of reviewing instructional supports and enrichment for neurodivergent students, especially at the elementary level.
 I think in course selection at the high school level, we see a little bit of autonomy and power that students and family members have when they're choosing classes.
 And at the middle school level, as was evidenced here tonight, with our new schedule, we have more opportunity for this.
 It's the elementary that we really need to be focusing on.
 What does that spectrum look like?
 How are we enriching neurodivergent students who need a challenge and who need to have some meaningful exposure and access?
 The professional development that we are continuing in this realm, as I spoke about, instructional vision, GLEAM, but it's also culturally responsive, equity-centered, trauma-informed approaches.
 In relation to what I spoke about before, it's also safe schools.
 We brought on, as I reported before, we brought on safe schools this year at the elementary level, all of the elementary staff.
 had very critical training on safe schools on that first professional development day.
 That has also led into our elementary principals working with their staff to make sure that we are establishing rainbow clubs at the elementary level.
 That is work that is beginning right now so that our elementary students and families have that support.
 Again, fidelity to responsive classroom, equitable access to programs and supports, and then policies that affirm and protect every student's identity.
 I think it's really important to call this out, especially for this board here.
 The school committee has really made sure that this
 is a priority in the policies that they have brought forward, that they have passed, that they have stamped, that we have made sure are established in Medford Public Schools.
 First and foremost, I think, is the non-discrimination policy, which included harassment and retaliation.
 There was the non-discrimination on the basics of gender identity.
 the immigration enforcement policy, the equal education opportunity policy, the dress code policy, the bullying policy, just to name a few.
 The last focus area is to update and modernize facilities and security.
 critical to ensure that safety measures are in place and followed.
 I'm not going to stand here and say that this is all perfectly in place.
 There are places where this is solidly in place.
 I would say gold star goes to the Mississippi elementary school.
 Every time
 Dr. Talbot and I are visiting for our rounds.
 We are greeted with a pleasant greeting and then asked what our purpose is.
 We have to make sure that that model is at every school building.
 Safe, well-maintained facilities.
 I think we heard from Habib and we had Mr. Lord at the podium.
 And though there are some maybe frightening things about it, I welcome the conversation.
 to get to some decision-making around what Medford Public Schools can handle in these updates, what needs to be placed in capital planning.
 I have all the faith in Mr. Lord and his leadership.
 He has already been establishing wonderful structures, and that's just been three months.
 So I have a lot of faith in where we're headed.
 And then the other piece is consistent communication and family engagement, which I alluded to before, but the family engagement is definitely a muscle that we need to be flexing a little bit more and building.
 Moving on to the next pillar, which is consistency.
 And that's ensuring equitable access to high quality learning.
 Our strengths are dedicated, skilled educators committed to growth and improvement.
 And we see that every single day.
 I just have to call out our educators who it is so evident as we go from classroom to classroom, how much they care about their students and how much work they are putting in to their lessons so that students are getting all that they need and feel supported.
 A collaborative culture among instructional teams is a strength.
 And our students are a huge strength.
 They are invested and ready for learning.
 I think one of the poignant pieces that I'll expand upon a little bit is no matter what level from classroom to classroom, our students are engaged and they are compliant and they are ready.
 They are ready for the next level of Medford Public Schools to make sure that we are providing them the excellence, the rigor, the challenge that they deserve, the support that they deserve.
 And then again, huge strength for us is engaged caregivers and community members.
 They are completely committed to advancing instructional excellence and that is seen on a daily basis.
 So what does this pillar of consistency mean?
 It means that building trust and ensuring that every student in every school experiences the same high standard of excellence.
 It extends beyond instruction to include the environment, the resources, and the communication systems that sustain learning.
 The biggest piece of this is that true consistency means a student's opportunity to succeed doesn't depend on the teacher or the school in which they attend.
 It is up to us to ensure that that consistency is throughout the entire district.
 So moving on to our areas of growth.
 Oh, well, before I get to that one, I'm sorry, I forgot about this.
 This is just a brief snapshot.
 There is a lot more data to pour over.
 when it comes to ensuring equitable access.
 But I think this is our accountability data for the past two years.
 It is just an overview and just a snapshot so that you can see a little bit of where we have been just in the past two years.
 Now, I think it's very easy to say there was a lot that was happening last year.
 around MCAS and regulations that had shifted and executive orders that were in place, but it is still work for us to be looking that our performance overall declined in a lot of subgroups.
 And so our Asian and multi-race subgroup
 showed the most improvement.
 And so those two subgroups made substantial progress in meeting goals.
 And we have work to do across the district and in other subgroups.
 And so really, these results highlight the need for consistent instructional quality
 data informed and inclusive supports, and targeted interventions to promote equitable progress for all of our learners.
 This is a little bit what I highlighted before, we need to make sure that that is happening across the district and not siloed in areas.
 So leading to our focus areas,
 Thank you.
 Strengthen vertical alignment and instructional coaching across levels.
 So that vertical alignment that I spoke about before, how we're going to get to that is first and foremost, we're looking at conducting a humanities curriculum review.
 and alignment, we need to make sure that curriculum materials and instruction is inclusive and that they are high quality instructional materials.
 That is work that is ongoing, that Dr. Talbot is leading in direct work with Dr. Chiesa and her department.
 Increased time on learning that we saw through the updated school schedule, which we saw a little bit tonight, has really provided and opened up access and opportunity for our students.
 Oh, thank you.
 And then our district walkthrough schedule, we have been aligning that and developing that so that it is consistent across the district.
 So during,
 school leadership meetings, during district leadership meetings, everyone is on the same page and everyone is talking about instruction that is aligned to our instructional vision.
 And then our continued partnership with UnboundEd, with the Lynch Leadership Academy and with Hill for Literacy.
 I think it's important to note that on the side here, these are some quotes that were gathered in the community meetings and the surveys.
 And so one of them that spoke profoundly to me that I wanted to make sure that I included here was, to collect and analyze student data, to design and implement differentiated structures of support,
 coaching, and professional development to build the capacity of staff, which includes principals, department leads, and teachers, to deliver and support culturally responsive instruction.
 And I view that quote as a charge, and that is work that we are making sure that we can meet for the community member that so profoundly mentioned it.
 Another focus area is a review of current student services and supports.
 So this came up in varied ways during my community meetings.
 Some were around college prep, some were around supports for caregivers, around social emotional supports that the school could help them with.
 It came in lots of different veins, but really the importance to this was to make sure that we review current practices and materials.
 That is happening now in a lot of our conversations and will be developed throughout the year.
 And it also was making sure that we are developing and distributing those resources so that caregivers know where they are.
 So some of the ways we've done that is,
 Our comms director, Mr. Will Pippicelli has built out part of our website to include a lot of those supports.
 There's now at the hands ready resources and support for our immigrant families.
 And so we've been having conversations around with other department leaders around how can we really be building our website to make sure that it is an area of resource and support for the community.
 and then making sure that our professional development is aligned with this core focus.
 One of the things we're looking at is co-teaching practices and places where they're really rock solid that could model for other areas that might need a little bit of increased professional development.
 Another focus area was increased rigor and student voice and learning.
 I've mentioned this before, but this is where it shows up in action.
 And so our instructional vision has given the path to that.
 Our aligned professional development consultancies and coaching also support that.
 But what we're really making sure we're working on is when we're in a classroom,
 The lesson plan and the content may be grade level.
 But what we're asking students to do to show that learning is the area of focus for us this year.
 And that's in the planning.
 So what that looks like, students that might need some scaffolded supports,
 But we don't want to over support because then we're going to drop that rigor and we're going to have that that lesson now be not grade level.
 And then in areas where students might be exceeding above grade level, what does that look like?
 So that's the work that we have ongoing this year.
 The next professional development day, just two weeks away, is also going to be continuing this.
 We have unbounded coming back and continuing that sustained professional development that they did in August.
 Instructional technology.
 This, this was also a thread.
 And so the things that came up the most, and especially from from caregivers but also from staff was a review of screen time policies and finding that balance.
 to technology and offline learning.
 And that came through in even right down to not just instructional classroom spaces, but also it's an indoor recess day and do we have to have screen time to fill that time.
 And so a review of how and when we're using technology in classrooms.
 And how like the AI policy comes into play is all is all conversation.
 And then of course a review and enhancement of monitoring systems.
 So we have firewalls in school but if students are taking those Chromebooks home, what does that look like.
 So making sure that we are.
 Also providing that communication to caregivers so that they're really clear is a focus area for us.
 And then as previously mentioned, continuing to diversify our educator staffing.
 This has been a significant challenge for Medicare public schools.
 We have tried multiple avenues in order to have greater success with this.
 We are continuing, well we are starting an audit of our recruitment efforts and procedures, but I think some of the biggest pieces that we're really trying to leverage is our partnerships with local universities for student teachers, as well as our City Year reps.
 So we have some City Year Corps members
 And this year we have some city year student teachers.
 And so they were core members in the past, and now they're coming back to Medford Public Schools as student teachers.
 And we're hoping that this might be a nice partnership that will provide us with some diverse candidates, as well as the universities that we are partnering with.
 And Dr. Talbot is leading that work to bring in more diverse representation within our student teaching
 fellows.
 And then the last pillar is coherence.
 And so coherence is putting all of this together.
 It's aligning systems, priorities, and partnerships.
 And so our strength for coherence is a shared vision for student success and community partnership.
 And it's a strong sense of purpose and collaboration.
 And so what does it look like when a system is coherent?
 Well, it ensures that every part of the district, operations, instruction, and communication work in sync toward a shared purpose.
 When systems are aligned and information is clear, families understand expectations, staff can focus on instruction, and students experience stability and trust.
 In a coherent system, messages, maintenance, and mission all move together to support learning and belonging for everybody.
 So what does this look like for our focus areas?
 I think this is really where we start to see the systems that were in some areas woefully needed.
 So our first focus area is to improve communication and communication alignment district-wide.
 So when I was gathering this information, some of this review of the current systems in place has already started.
 I think we had the SMORES platform for a very long time.
 And I think when I came in as interim, that was one of those intentional,
 decisions that I made to make sure that the Friday memo is using the platform that we want school leaders to be using and that there's that consistency for caregivers so that they know what that format is and they can navigate it with ease.
 And so there were places where that maybe wasn't as aligned to the district expectations and there are still areas for improvement.
 It's probably never going to be perfect, but
 That review is ongoing and needed.
 And then to streamline processes and communication chains.
 So this came up a lot.
 So when parents have questions, who should they reach out to?
 So establishing that chain of command was important.
 The update of our org chart, which is on the website, I think gives a snapshot for caregivers to understand where they can reach out to
 pertaining to what their question may be.
 And I know Principal Cabral at the high school has created her own chain of command.
 She has her own org chart so that you can look and see where the key personnel lie and it makes it a little easier.
 So some of that work is in process.
 And then I heard over and over again,
 from staff as well as caregivers.
 Can you please do this at least once a year?
 And I think that format, which was for my meetings, my community meetings, it was agenda free.
 And I think people really appreciated a dialogue and a discourse to just talk about what they really appreciate and what they really hope.
 And so I want to make sure that I honor that and that we figure out a way and that we are scheduling and making sure that we're doing in community forums to inform practice, to honor that stakeholder input.
 And it also strengthens belonging.
 And so we have some upcoming forums, I think, which will be critical for caregivers around
 the vision, the mission, and the leadership of Medford Public Schools, but that is something that I want to make sure stays at least an annual basis.
 Continuing facilities maintenance and safety upgrades.
 And so some of this work, so you saw this evening the conditions report that has come in, and
 We will be aligning that work to our district work as well as the capital planning moving forward.
 The creation of the chief operations officer, that position oversees facilities, IT, and security.
 Those are three areas that were in desperate need of systems and structures.
 And Mr. Lord has already begun to do that work.
 And there's a lot more to go.
 I know it's only been three months, but I am very grateful for that.
 And then I know that this body has already been reported on, but it's very important to note that the security camera upgraded every school, the keyless entry and the vape detectors at the secondary level.
 Those upgrades should be finished by the end of this calendar year.
 There we go, that's perfect.
 And that's very exciting to us.
 really need the keyless entry.
 And that's going to help the just the overall functioning of the district in ways that we should have been doing a very long time ago.
 So we're really excited for that one.
 And then we, Mr. Lord is spearheading the establishment of a district safety committee.
 And so I think
 in partnership with that, each school has their own, is developing their own safety committee.
 We've got a lot of interested and dedicated administrators who signed up to be on the district safety committee, but this is gonna be an opportunity for us to make sure we're having frequent and regular conversations with our community and city partners so that we are all aligned in the loop
 and making sure that we keep the safety of our buildings and our staff and our students top priority.
 Academic coherence and alignment.
 And so this is the piece that really is gonna focus on.
 We don't want it to look different depending on which teacher you get or what school you're in or what team you have at middle school.
 It needs to be here are expectations across the district.
 So promoting that rigor and that equity and that belonging across all schools and all departments is the priority of this year.
 And Dr. Talbot is leading this work with the school and department leaders.
 making sure that we are having high quality instructional materials in the hands of our teachers for our students is critical.
 There are places in this district where that is a growing edge for us and that's a focus for this year.
 And I will plant a seed that some of that does cost money.
 And so there will be ongoing conversations around needed curriculum.
 And then
 I've highlighted on it before, but where we are now in terms of taking our instructional vision, the findings of this and more findings to come, and what that looks like for our strategic planning for Metro Public Schools.
 And then certainly not least, but lastly, the expansion of our afterschool programs and the capacity for access and equity.
 A lot of work has been done with this and I'm just, I'm actually really proud of this collaborative effort.
 So a task force was established and it is regularly meeting.
 We actually have a meeting tomorrow night.
 We have very dedicated and invested caregivers.
 We have two school leaders, two site coordinators.
 Mr. Pippicelli helps facilitate that.
 And then Megan Fidlecari is also part of that committee.
 And it's doing some great work.
 So far, we've seen about 68 seats added to our afterschool programming just this year alone.
 And the basic consultancy, Mr. Andrew Mumford and oh my goodness, I'm going to forget the other gentleman's name.
 I'm very sorry.
 They will be joining our task force meeting tomorrow as they're beginning their work this school year to really kind of
 get a sense as to how we're operating and give us some areas for improvement to really help us be able to grow our capacity in a sustained and meaningful way in benefit of our students and families.
 And then we did see, just one more thing, Mr. Pippisali, I'm sorry.
 We did see a staffing upgrade there.
 So two of our site coordinators are now full-time, which gives the program a little added support to really be working on making sure that we're as staffed as we possibly can be and what that recruitment looks like and working on what the curriculum looks like.
 And then now you may go, Mr., thank you.
 All in all, if we're building for our future together, what does that look like?
 And so I think you could see through all of these slides, Medford's greatest strength is really its people.
 It really truly is.
 We have caring educators, families, and students that are committed to one another.
 You see that in every space you go in.
 Our next chapter is now about focus and alignment as we build systems that match our heart with our practice.
 so that every student learns, thrives and belongs.
 And we wanna make sure that teachers, that we're equipping teachers with, what does that mean?
 You can protect and care for your students while also having high expectations for them academically.
 And so that's the work, that's the push this year.
 Our students are ready and we have to push them.
 And so part of this is engaging stakeholders in defining priorities for our vision, mission, and leadership for Medford Public Schools and making sure that we capture those diverse voices in Medford in that work.
 And I think the varied format that was discussed at the subcommittee really will go a long way to making sure that we capture every voice in Medford.
 And then using these findings between the findings that I have presented here to you this evening and the findings that we will gather through that work, we're gonna have a great pool of resource to be able to pull from in developing Medford's next strategic plan.
 And that strategic plan will be a coherent roadmap for systematic improvement and student achievement, detailing the actions and the benchmarks required to achieve sustained success.
 And so that concludes my report of entry findings in building belonging, excellence, and opportunity across Medford Public Schools.
 And I am happy to answer any questions that you may have.

 谢谢。
 我将只回答一个问题，至少现在是这样。
 所以我希望你能告诉我们。
 因此，我认为我喜欢这份报告的发现之处在于，它们真正定义了学习的条件是什么样的，以及我们需要做什么才能真正最大化这些条件。
 我很想听听你的学术表现如何
 所有这些因素，特别是在实时监控方面。
 我认为你展示了责任分数，这些分数提供了丰富的信息。
 他们还告诉我们发生了什么。
 他们不会主动告诉我们发生了什么事。
 所以我很想听听你对此的看法。
 这是一个很好的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10033.318s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 我会尽力记住现在脑子里的一切。
 我想，是的，我的意思是，首先，我认为你对这个问题有很高的答案。
 然后你有一些，
 底部有螺母和螺钉。
 我想如果我愿意的话，我可以选择一件小事，比如说一件事情，其中​​一个领域。
 梅德福公立学校可能失去了一些书面责任。
 然后我们看到，在某些领域，那些可能被归类为符合期望的学生，一旦计算出写作成绩，他们就会下降一点。
 因此，我们讨论的、塔尔伯特博士正在研究的领域之一就是写作。
 这是必不可少的一部分。
 总的来说，我想说的是，我在这份报告中真正想指出的是，我们拥有所有这些数据，这些数据帮助我们了解了我们的发展方向。
 比方说，我们能够获得的一些中立报告、我们能够获得的大量观察结果以及学校领导获得的一些数据都在我们的教室里。
 正如我之前提到的，但我可以解释一下。
 我们真正吸引了那些准备好学习并根据他们的年级水平提供内容的学生。
 但我们对学生的要求并不总是符合他们学校水平的期望。
 我认为也许我们所看到的是我们需要在课堂上进行更高水平的讨论。
 因此，学生真正理解他们正在学习的内容的一部分方法是努力解决它，与同龄人讨论它，而不是在孤岛或孤立地工作。
 你知道。
 吐出内容或数据。
 我认为这是我们需要锻炼的肌肉。
 所以，我们必须，抱歉，我们必须建造，我们必须建造这个。
 因此，我们看到了其中一些机会，或者你可能会说错过了一些机会，这是我们今年与团队一起进行的专业发展的一部分。
 那么，您的计划是什么样的？
 当您坐下来计划时，我们确定您在计划吗？
 以便您的指导符合年级水平。
 是的，我想我们可以勾选这个框。
 我们的教学是在学校层面。
 但如果我们进入下一个阶段，我们能确保它对我们的学生有吸引力吗？
 如果是这样，怎么办？
 你如何让它有吸引力？
 您如何确保他们能够在所学内容中看到自己以及为什么这很重要？
 那么如何让它变得有意义呢？
 然后
 我认为我们需要更多地拉动和支持这些杠杆，因为我认为这会带来一定程度的理解，但也许并非所有学生都能参与其中。
 我认为他正在散步。
 这就是学习。
 今天你可以和我们的学生一起看到这一点，对吗？
 这种情况发生在我们一些具有挑战性的课程中，因为学生积极参与。
 他们实时解决问题，他们进行基于项目的学习，你在专业学校看到这一点，你走进任何商店，任何学生都能够停下来告诉你他们在做什么，它如何与国家标准保持一致，为什么它很重要，以及他们最终会得到什么，但这可能不会在每个学术领域发生。
 我们的学生需要有经验并接触它，这样当他们需要参加标准化考试或一个大项目时，他们必须展示他们所知道的知识，我们给他们机会去应对它并在比仅仅更深层次上理解它
 从板上复制一些东西或者只是吐出事实。
 这有道理吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10297.975s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 他做到了。
 我认为还有一个组成部分要确保教师拥有识别它并揭示它的工具。
 当这种情况没有发生时，如何进行干预。
 那么你怎么知道这是实时发生的呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10313.025s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 所以我认为我们实施的事情
 去年还在进行中，但今年实施的是GLEAM规划。
 我们现在拥有一个一致的旅程工具，它在 GLEAM 和我们的教学愿景之间建立了交叉。
 所以学校的领导、部门的领导，他们来的时候，都是同一个旅程。
 这样每个人都在寻找相同的东西，谈论相同的优势和增长领域。
 因此，林奇领导力学院的专业发展现在正在与我们的学校和部门领导一起进行。
 这就是训练。
 这就是观察反馈的指导。
 这就是训练要具备的
 也许是一些具有挑战性或困难的对话。
 新的林奇领导力学院正在培训我们的管理人员。
 他们将进行巡视并培训我们的管理员如何参与这些对话。
 他们正在观察这种不作为，以便向我们的管理员提供直接反馈。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10388.908s">[Erika Reinfeld]</a>: 谢谢。
 你知道我可以谈论这个问题很长时间，但我看到很多绿灯，所以我给我的同事让路。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10398.733s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: 谢谢。
 回到演讲的相关部分，您谈到了很多关于忠诚于响应式课堂和恢复性司法的问题。
 你能多谈谈它的实际情况吗？
 我知道我们已经讨论这个问题有一段时间了，这种做法的成本和实施非常耗时，而且可能相当困难。
 所以我只是想多听听一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10419.987s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 不，谢谢。
 这是我可能会谈论一整天的另一件事。
 在新冠疫情期间，响应式课堂在整个学区真正发挥了作用。
 我们希望确保当时的重点确实是社交情感学习。
 这种安全感是不同层次的。
 因此，在小学阶段，有一个响应式课堂。
 课堂上有很多积极响应的专业发展。
 每年在新教师入职周期间，都会提供响应式课堂培训。
 并将其纳入小学课程表中。
 这就是为什么小学生每天都以晨会开始新的一天。
 这是第一级。
 然后所有的学生都聚集在一起。
 在此期间没有任何服务。
 没有其他事情发生。
 也许有那么一段时间，
 每周一次的小提琴或管弦乐队课程，因为很难安排。
 但这是为老师保留全班的神圣时间。
 这就是社区建立的地方。
 您还可以在这里创建期望并为这些期望建模。
 有时，正如学生们经常发生的那样，
 有时必须重塑期望，而这个社区空间就是完美的空间。
 今年我们还有一位整个夏天都表现出色的老师。
 珍·埃利斯 (Jen Ellis) 是布鲁克斯大学的教授。
 她致力于对齐
 晨会，以便我们每月一次进行全区范围的重点会议。
 因此，每个月的早会都有不同的焦点，由总监开始。
 导演正在组织系列集会并为整个月定下基调。
 然后还有老师们主持的早会上的其他活动和课程。
 因此，整个地区都有一条连续的线路。
 塔尔博特博士，这个月有责任吗？
 是的，好的，只是检查一下。
 我不是每个月都记得这一点，但是，当我们进行一些旅行时，你可以在黑板上看到老师们如何将早上会议的信息与校长刚刚在集会上所做的事情联系起来，你知道，前一天或前一周，这很酷。
 所以我认为这个话题已经非常确定了。
 我确信总会有令人担忧的领域。
 我认为最重要的部分是恢复性实践。
 因此，当我们真正有意识地努力纳入响应式课堂时，它们在中学阶段并不存在。
 如您所知，我们现在是八年级，他们今年将在中学进行试点。
 没错，该区有两名教育工作者。
 其中之一正在响应式课堂进行培训。
 另一位是响应式课堂培训师，为响应式课堂工作。
 这是一位高中艺术老师 Jen Belanger。
 所以他看高中部分只是为了看看。
 关于恢复性实践的文章是高质量的教学材料，真正有助于创建这个社区。
 我们把这个带到了我们的二级团队，这样我们就可以创造这个循环时间。
 以便教师能够在中学阶段进行社区建设。
 有时，当信任被打破或需要重新设定期望时，这也是一个空间，该计划的一个组成部分可以将人们聚集在一起，受影响的学生和学生，受影响的工作人员，以便可以进行对话。
 来弥补已经发生的事情。
 新冠疫情期间，这种方式在中学的实施方式就像火车到公交车的模式。
 因此，引入塔尔伯特博士，我们正在做的就是研究这个结构是什么，因为它是一种孤立的东西。
 整个区。
 有一些学校领导和一些老师确实很好地使用了恢复性实践。
 在某些区域，更新是完全必要的，或者根本不需要更新。
 最重要的是，为每个人提供文本，塔尔伯特博士确保所有学校和部门领导都掌握了该文本。
 然后看看我们的培训师名单以及我们能做什么，我会说我们非常有意地努力让新教师在入职周期间接受恢复性实践培训。
 所以我们有两个人，我想他们是科琳·马哈尼和谢丽尔·佐丹奴。
 感谢带领他完成入门课程的中学教师。
 我们的新老师有一个框架，但我们实际上正在致力于其使用的保真度。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10746.355s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 非常感谢。
 谢谢。
 格雷厄姆议员，然后是我们的学生代表和卢梭议员，如果我理解正确的话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10756.059s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 谢谢。
 我只是想感谢你所做的所有这些工作。
 当我们邀请他担任这个角色时，这并没有出现在今年任何人的议程上。
 我们也给了他足够的时间来适应这份工作。
 我认为，从各方面来看，你都做得很快。
 我非常感激你在这里所做的不仅仅是适应工作和保持正常工作。
 用他们的话来说，他们正在为这里需要发生的绝大多数事情创造一致性。
 你不仅要命名和框架，还要领导这项工作。
 所以我认为这只是一个很好的总结，开头是：你为什么这样做？
 我真的很想说我是多么感激它。
 我同意你的观点，当我们谈到这一点时，我保证当我们谈论战略规划时我会非常快，但是我们可以快速构建和移动许多相互关联的部分。
 所以谢谢你。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10825.394s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 史蒂夫.
 我们的学生代表。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10831.755s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 楼上的先生是迈克，请。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10835.096s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 我可以做到这一点。
 凯特为我做了这件事。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10841.128s">[Christine DesAutels]</a>: 开始了。
 我认为这可能是一个小细节，但我想知道如何解释责任评级图表，因为责任评级到底是什么？
 这意味着什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10856.195s">[Unidentified]</a>: 这是一个很好的问题。
 很好的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10859.896s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 因此，教育部每年都会制定学校必须达到的目标。
 他们按照小进步、中等进步、实质性进步、远高于进步的标准来衡量。
 这意味着，当我们关注所有学生时，我们甚至拒绝关注全球范围内的每个人，但关注较小的学生群体也非常重要。
 所以你在这里看到我们有很大的需求，其中包括
 许多这样的类别在一起。
 我们有一群英语学生、低收入学生、残疾学生。
 然后我们有我们的种族群体。
 我们有亚洲人、黑人、非裔美国人、西班牙裔、拉丁裔、多种族和白人。
 因此，教育部关注的是全球范围内每个人在实现他们为我们设定的目标方面的表现。
 然后你还会查看所有这些子组，看看在某些地方，当你第一次查看分数或他们的责任评级时，他们可能看起来都做得很好。
 但当你深入挖掘时，有时会发现有一些学生没有达到目标。
 我们有责任调查这里发生的事情以及我们如何提供帮助？
 另一部分是，教育部给我们的问责评级是去年的评级，然后是今年的评级。
 在本例中，他们选择了 2024 年和 2025 年，并希望取平均值。
 这就是他们获得责任评级的方式。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10978.679s">[Christine DesAutels]</a>: 这是基于类似的基于 MCAS 的测试吗？
 机动CAS。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=10985.124s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 它基于 MCAS 课程。
 仅限 MCAS。
 这有用吗？
 您还有其他问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=11001.716s">[Christine DesAutels]</a>: 不，我想我很好。
 好吧，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=11005.719s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 卢索议员？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=11008.858s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 我真的可以再问一件事吗？是的，我只是想尝试得到更具体的答案。
 我知道您对这个过程是如何完成的以及这个过程的重要性给出了非常详细的解释。
 我想我们在问……我不想吹牛，但我想我们在问……
 主要是因为责任作为统计数据的实际分类是什么？
 学生的百分比是否达到年级水平预期？
 是这样吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=11043.344s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 哦，谢谢你。
 当然。
 是的。
 所以它是基于MCAS的。
 因此，这是对梅德福公立学校如何实现教育部指定目标的评估。
 因此，他们使用 MCAS 作为实现这一目标的工具。
 他们会关注从三年级到十年级的每一次考试。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=11071.431s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 我很抱歉。
 也许是我表达得不够清楚。
 到底是什么？
 责任评级是一个百分比。
 它的百分比是多少？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=11086.542s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 和。
 如果我不清楚，我很抱歉。
 这是一个百分比。
 所以如果是的话，你可以自己看看。
 如果你去教育部或者只是谷歌并输入梅德福责任评级，它就会出现，这样你就可以看到那里有一个计算，他们在哪里查看，我必须回去看看，我不想错误引用确切的计算，但我想说，这就像我们去年的表现的百分比。
 他们从我们今年的业绩中抽取一定比例，然后对其进行平均，从而得出我们的责任评级。
 所以他们的研究期限为两年。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=11126.868s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 然后它具有时间方面。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=11129.349s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: 对不起，什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BvvNXiHAPeI&t=11131.23s">[Alachie Yeager]</a>: 所以这里有一个时间方面。
 这比往年有进步吗？</p>
