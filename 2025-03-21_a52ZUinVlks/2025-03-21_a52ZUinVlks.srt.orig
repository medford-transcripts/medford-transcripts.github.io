82
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:40,409

00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:26,096
[SPEAKER_16]: have a determination as to whether or not they need a special license for extended hours at this point in time?

99
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:27,357
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't know.

100
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:29,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we don't have the particulars on that.

101
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't feel so comfortable.

102
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,365
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could just find out if there's a problem, let the gentleman know that he has to obtain a 24-hour license.

103
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:39,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'd be supportive of the measure if we granted a normal

104
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:49,860
[SPEAKER_16]: license and allowed the gentleman to come back and petition for extended hours at a later date.

105
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Provided.

106
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,201
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no request for extended hours of operation.

107
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,881
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at the petition, it says 24-7.

108
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:56,702
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry?

109
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:57,662
[SPEAKER_16]: The petition says 24-7.

110
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:08,980
[SPEAKER_16]: So my concern would be that we're approving it for 24 seven, but he may have a requirement to go through a special permit as well.

111
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:09,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

112
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,821
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a motion for approval on the floor.

113
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:23,586
[SPEAKER_11]: What does the council wish to do with the amendment that if there is, if there is, uh, uh, if it has to be changed, if they have to come back to change the hours, we'll, we'll notify the gentleman.

114
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,588
[SPEAKER_19]: So, uh, approval is granted.

115
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:31,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, and if they need a permit to have 24 hour operation,

116
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,470
[SPEAKER_19]: they will be notified by the city clerk's office.

117
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:37,871
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

118

121
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:42,993

00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:16,977
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it resolved.

153
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,857
[SPEAKER_19]: That lane markings be painted on Route 60 West heading into Medford Square, starting at Pure Hockey.

154
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:38,610
[SPEAKER_19]: Additionally, that clearly marked left turn lanes coming from City Hall Mall Road onto Route 60 be painted in the interest of public safety.

155
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:54,173
[SPEAKER_19]: There we are.

156
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:55,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Max.

157
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:56,174
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize.

158
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:57,655
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

159
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:04,157
[SPEAKER_22]: And, um, I know we have a resident here, Max, uh, that would like to speak on the issue.

160
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:11,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, this has been an issue that's, uh, been, um, on the agenda for the city for several months now.

161
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:20,624
[SPEAKER_22]: And if anyone's familiar with the area, if you're coming down route 60 going West, heading into the square, uh, right around, uh, pure hockey,

162
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:24,957
[SPEAKER_22]: the lane markings are non-existent.

163
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:32,901
[SPEAKER_22]: And when cars are merging onto that portion of Salem Street, they really don't know which lane to be in.

164
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:49,470
[SPEAKER_22]: And coupled with the fact that if you're on City Hall Mall Road, which is right next to City Hall, and you're coming onto Route 60 from City Hall Mall Road, and you're taking a left there,

165
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:54,624
[SPEAKER_22]: There are no markings when you get onto Salem Street which lane you should be in.

166
00:10:54,644 --> 00:11:00,629
[SPEAKER_22]: So you could be in the far left lane trying to get into the right lane so you can go towards West Method.

167
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,071
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's really a free for all.

168
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:12,478
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm shocked there hasn't been a major, major accident or even pedestrian safety concern there based on the lack of markings.

169
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:18,182
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, this has been reported for the past, I believe, close to two months.

170
00:11:18,732 --> 00:11:28,901
[SPEAKER_22]: on C-Click fix and it's been escalated up to the DPW, but I'm not quite sure why lane markings that were already established.

171
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:30,942
[SPEAKER_22]: We're not recreating a new road.

172
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:34,225
[SPEAKER_22]: We're not asking for engineers to go out there.

173
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:40,010
[SPEAKER_22]: We're asking to repaint the lane marking in the area of, in the interest of public safety.

174
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,829
[SPEAKER_22]: why this can't be done.

175
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:49,112
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm offering it tonight, Mr. President, with the hopes that this will go immediately to DPW.

176
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,293
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think this is a traffic commission issue.

177
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:56,876
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just a mere painting of already existing faded lane markings.

178
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:59,957
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would ask that the DPW go out there immediately

179
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:17,909
[SPEAKER_22]: in the interest of public safety and rectify the left turn lanes coming from City Hall Mall Road onto Route 60, and also coming down Route 60 West, heading into Meffitt Square, right about where Pure Hockey is going forward.

180
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,911
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would ask that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

181
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:24,732
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know we have a resident that has the same concern, Mr. President.

182
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,053
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councillor.

183
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:29,595
[SPEAKER_19]: And on the motion for approval by Councillor Max, Councillor Knight.

184
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I think this is a great resolution.

185
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,860
[SPEAKER_16]: It's something that I'm going to be supporting.

186
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:49,234
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope the gentleman doesn't mind if I amend it to request the same at the foot of Forest Street at Salem with a right turn onto Forest Street and a left turn onto Main as well as the arrow that goes straight up High Street because I see a lot of confusion in front of Modern Pastry in that area as well.

187
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:53,278
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think it's a great resolution and it's certainly something that I support wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

188
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,900
[SPEAKER_19]: As amended by Councilor Knight and seconded.

189
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,701
[SPEAKER_19]: Sir, you wish to address the council?

190
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:00,121
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.

191
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Please state your name and address for the record.

192
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:06,243
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Maxim Weinstein, 57 Ashland Street in Medford.

193
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:19,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was one of the people who contributed to what has become a fairly lengthy comment thread on the see if you click fix item that was reported by another resident six or seven weeks ago at least.

194
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:42,587
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I want to first say that, you know, I want to give credit to the administration and to the city council for supporting the C-Click Fix efforts because I think it is a really valuable tool both to improve the ability of residents to report these issues and for the city to be aware of them and to track them and to provide visibility.

195
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:44,604
[SPEAKER_12]: into what's going on.

196
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:53,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think one of the sort of growing pains we've seen with the system so far is that issues get added.

197
00:13:53,927 --> 00:14:02,269
[SPEAKER_12]: And frankly, I will say that some of the residents don't seem entirely clear on how to use the system to the maximum effect either.

198
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,490
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I think the city has at times

199
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:15,514
[SPEAKER_12]: It left some of these issues languishing without any sort of response or communication back as to what state they're in.

200
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:24,622
[SPEAKER_12]: I noticed this particular issue when I just looked at it about 15 minutes ago was marked as closed for no apparent reason.

201
00:14:24,642 --> 00:14:28,985
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the way, I think anyone with a login can mark an issue as closed.

202
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:31,748
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think only the city has the power to do that.

203
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:32,128
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not 100% sure.

204
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,973
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just sitting there marked as closed, even though clearly it isn't.

205
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,913
[SPEAKER_12]: I walked out there before the meeting.

206
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,454
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not resolved.

207
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,355
[SPEAKER_12]: So I marked it open again, by the way.

208
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:57,379
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I do think that as much as anything, you know, first of all, I agree with Councillor Marks that it doesn't seem like repainting the lines should be something that should take that long necessarily.

209
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:00,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know all the processes of the city, but it does seem like a long time.

210
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:24,046
[SPEAKER_12]: But it also is a communications issue, and I think the administration should be encouraged to ensure that they're making use of this system, not just to record these issues and to address them, but also to ensure they're communicating effectively with the people who are reporting them and other people who are looking at the system and trying to use it for that purpose.

211
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,106
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's all.

212
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:25,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

213
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:40,838
[SPEAKER_22]: I think what we heard tonight is yet again more important feedback that Max just mentioned about when we met with the mayor last week about how we can improve C-Click Fix.

214
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:49,604
[SPEAKER_22]: And one of the issues was that we noticed that C-Click Fix is turning into a blog session where people just blog back and forth.

215
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:51,185
[SPEAKER_22]: And you could say, well, I think

216
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,059
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, we need to paint the crosswalk.

217
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,800
[SPEAKER_22]: And then someone else comes on there and says, Oh, that's ridiculous.

218
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,821
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, you know, what do you, what do you think you're doing?

219
00:15:57,901 --> 00:16:00,422
[SPEAKER_22]: Or, you know, and that's not what the intent is.

220
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:11,788
[SPEAKER_22]: The intent is as Max mentioned, uh, to get a quick response from city hall, uh, and also to be logged into the system and then get a response back on when a completion shall take place.

221
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:14,689
[SPEAKER_22]: And clearly that's not currently happening right now.

222
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:21,112
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think there is an omission in the system with reporting back to residents and, uh,

223
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:28,859
[SPEAKER_22]: just to close out an item to make it look like the city is responding is not necessarily the best approach.

224
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:37,103
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'd rather see items open and still trying to be resolved than just to quickly close an item and then hope it goes away.

225
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:39,744
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I think that's what's currently taking place right now.

226
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:42,206
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's why I put this on tonight, Mr. President.

227
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:48,789
[SPEAKER_22]: And I want to thank Max for coming up and the other residents that brought this to the attention.

228
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:49,736
[SPEAKER_22]: of the city.

229
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:51,096
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much, Councilor.

230
00:16:51,116 --> 00:17:01,719
[SPEAKER_19]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, and amended by Councilor Knight, roll call has been requested.

231
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,119
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Clerk, if you would kindly call the roll.

232
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:14,197
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

233
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:15,618
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

234
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:17,278
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

235
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:19,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Seven in the affirmative.

236
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,319
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

237
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,259
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello to take a paper off the table.

238
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:26,419
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

239
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,360
[SPEAKER_19]: On motion of Councilor Caviello to take 16-522.

240
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,080
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

241
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,700
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

242
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,201
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

243
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:40,382
[SPEAKER_19]: 16-522, Class 2 Auto Deal License A-Tech, 67 Mystic Street in Medford.

244
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:42,057
[SPEAKER_19]: It was tabled last week.

245
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:50,100
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a public hearing on the matter that was voted favorably on the petitioner's behalf.

246
00:17:50,220 --> 00:18:00,403
[SPEAKER_19]: However, when we got to dealing with the issuing of the license, the petitioner somehow had exited the building.

247
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:02,084
[SPEAKER_19]: And so now we have her here.

248
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,845
[SPEAKER_19]: If you would come state your name and address for the record.

249
00:18:07,158 --> 00:18:09,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for coming down in this delicate time in your life.

250
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:10,099
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

251
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,619
[SPEAKER_26]: Eliane Ferreira.

252
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,920
[SPEAKER_26]: And my address is 51 Tufts Street, Summerville, Mass.

253
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:16,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

254
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

255
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

256
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

257
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:24,582
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize for last week and for the mix-up.

258
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:25,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Quick question.

259
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:28,802
[SPEAKER_11]: How many cars did you plan on having in the lot?

260
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,343
[SPEAKER_26]: Twenty.

261
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:30,943
[SPEAKER_11]: How many?

262
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:31,523
[SPEAKER_26]: Twenty.

263
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:32,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Twenty.

264
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:32,663
[SPEAKER_26]: Twenty.

265
00:18:32,843 --> 00:18:33,783
[SPEAKER_11]: How many are there now?

266
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:34,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there 20 there now?

267
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:40,729
[SPEAKER_26]: No, it is, what I have now, it is 12.

268
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,131
[SPEAKER_11]: You only have 12 now?

269
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:46,395
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a possibility for 20 and a lot.

270
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:52,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I don't know if the property is capable of handling 20.

271
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:54,984
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to keep it at 12, that's there now.

272
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:02,024
[SPEAKER_11]: for at least a six month review.

273
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:08,649
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we feel that she can add eight more there, then she can come back for a review.

274
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:17,257
[SPEAKER_19]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, amended that there be a limitation of 12 cars on the property and that the petitioner report back to us.

275
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:25,457
[SPEAKER_19]: for a six-month review to see how the operation goes and if it's capable of accepting more automobiles on the premises.

276
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,600
[SPEAKER_11]: On that, Mr. President, I find the papers in order.

277
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,501
[SPEAKER_11]: I recommend approval.

278
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:29,642
[SPEAKER_19]: On that motion, all those in favor?

279
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:30,263
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

280
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:30,684
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion carries.

281
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:32,966
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations, as amended.

282
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:33,327
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

283
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:33,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

284
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:34,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Councillor Knight.

285
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:42,504
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm seeing here in the paperwork that was submitted by the code enforcement officer that an auto establishment in the C2 zone requires a special permit from the city council.

286
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:49,450
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the matter that these people are here before us for, but he also made a recommendation that the parking area associated with the business be limited.

287
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,273
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that that's what Councilor Cabello is trying to implement at this point in time.

288
00:19:53,413 --> 00:20:00,698
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I think that it's also important that they produce to this council a copy of their parking plan so that we can actually see.

289
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:03,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight, they don't park any cars on Mystic Avenue.

290
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,102
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all in the back there, but again,

291
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:11,658
[SPEAKER_11]: With the mechanic shop going in there and the used car, I think 20 might be pressing it a little bit.

292
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,298
[SPEAKER_19]: We just disposed of them all.

293
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:14,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I know, but I meant by that.

294
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,259
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's all right.

295
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,580
[SPEAKER_19]: I rest my case, Mr. President.

296
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

297
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,060
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

298
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam Council.

299
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:23,702
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have a motion to return back to the regular order of business?

300
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:24,362
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

301
00:20:24,402 --> 00:20:25,002
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

302
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:29,683
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion carries 16-529, authored by Vice President Langel-Kern.

303
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:34,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it resolved that a member of the President be allowed to address the City Council with regard to public

304
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:37,766
[SPEAKER_19]: pedestrian public safety, I apologize.

305
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:39,026
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Vice President.

306
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:40,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

307
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:43,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to actually move to table this until next week.

308
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:45,409
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Vice President Langel-Kern to table the matter.

309
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:46,450
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

310
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for suspension of the rules after that.

311
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,671
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

312
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:49,631
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion carries.

313
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:55,074
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Vice President Langel-Kern for suspension of the rules for what purpose, Madam Vice President?

314
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:59,295
[SPEAKER_10]: To take paper from the hand of the clerk with regards to the Shaw's development.

315
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:02,117
[SPEAKER_19]: We have residents- On the motion of Vice President Langel-Kern

316
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:07,568
[SPEAKER_19]: Paper from the hand of the clerk in regards to the Shaw's development.

317
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:08,689
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

318
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,791
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

319
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:12,172
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion carries.

320
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:30,525
[SPEAKER_19]: Offered by Vice President Longo Kern, be it resolved that the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals refrain from rendering, I apologize, a written opinion with regards to the development at the Shaw's site unit after next week.

321
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:39,051
[SPEAKER_19]: until after the next city council meeting and after an open public hearing on that motion.

322
00:21:39,471 --> 00:21:40,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

323
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:41,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, president dollars.

324
00:21:41,312 --> 00:21:45,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the council would like to have been more up to date on this issue.

325
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:57,460
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure we each know a good deal, but not in its entirety, what's going on with the Shah's development because the last two zoning board of appeals meetings were held during our city council meetings.

326
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:19,023
[SPEAKER_10]: In the meantime, I know the last, within the last couple days, it was brought to my attention that a decision is going to be rendered in favor of the 400, and this could be rumor, but in favor of the 490 units proposed, apartment units proposed at the site, including retail space, with only, I believe, 781 parking spaces.

327
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:19,824
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also a request by the

328
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:41,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I mentioned linkage by, I can be correct, stand corrected, but a million dollars, which I haven't heard of that in my tenure as a city councilor, and I find definitely concern with that figure being reduced.

329
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:43,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Linkage has never been reduced.

330
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:53,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Within the last, I think it was probably 10 years ago now, with regards to the apartments behind 9th Street, I remember attending a meeting opposing

331
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:56,235
[SPEAKER_10]: the massive size of that development.

332
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:58,456
[SPEAKER_10]: And at that time, there was a public meeting.

333
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:00,256
[SPEAKER_10]: It was held at the McGlynn Middle School.

334
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:02,177
[SPEAKER_10]: It was highly attended by the residents.

335
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:08,599
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's one thing that I'm definitely looking to ask the Zoning Board of Appeals to do before a decision's rendered.

336
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:20,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this, a lot of people want to come, a lot of residents want to come to the council meeting, and I believe at least one or two councillors want to put this on for next week to have a formal discussion in council chambers.

337
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:23,585
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the meantime, I'm just simply asking that

338
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:36,788
[SPEAKER_10]: The zoning board of appeals let the council catch up, let the residents be heard, and hold off on filing that decision.

339
00:23:36,908 --> 00:23:43,229
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there has been a possible complaint filed with regards to how those meetings were run.

340
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,310
[SPEAKER_10]: That's definitely an issue that I need to look into further.

341
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:53,392
[SPEAKER_10]: And the massive size with the traffic and parking impact in that neighborhood is something that people are,

342
00:23:54,865 --> 00:24:07,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Those meetings were highly attended, but more people, obviously, we need more attention to this issue, we need more publicity to this issue, and we need more time to allow the residents to voice their concerns.

343
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:19,974
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that I see that should be reduced in size, and that's just my opinion, but no matter what, we just need public input, and the council needs to, obviously, we're getting calls since we've heard the decision is gonna be rendered,

344
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,648
[SPEAKER_10]: phone calls and emails and reading about people being unhappy.

345
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:35,476
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just believe that the residents deserve, and the city of Medford as a whole deserves, time to voice those concerns and ask questions in a more appropriate manner.

346
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:39,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Vice President, if I might ask, why wasn't this brought to the council before?

347
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:44,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I had asked questions of residents.

348
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:45,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you talking about from me?

349
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:45,864
[SPEAKER_10]: From me?

350
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:47,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Or in general?

351
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,847
[SPEAKER_17]: No, why wasn't it brought to the city council?

352
00:24:49,647 --> 00:24:51,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it under our jurisdiction to have approved this?

353
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,408
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have approval as variances.

354
00:24:55,468 --> 00:25:02,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm asking for the public meeting that the zoning board had when the 9th Street apartments went up.

355
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,850
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't get involved.

356
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think the council got involved.

357
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't think it was going to happen this fast.

358
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:15,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I did have opinions that I planned on voicing when I caught up with the issue, but I think anything's under our purview when people are complaining and have concerns.

359
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:18,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we definitely need to get on top of it.

360
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,406
[SPEAKER_18]: But we don't have jurisdiction over the project.

361
00:25:21,806 --> 00:25:23,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not asking for jurisdiction.

362
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:33,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm asking for the zoning board to give it more time before the actual decision is rendered so the public has more time to voice their concerns.

363
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:35,592
[SPEAKER_10]: A public meeting, an open public meeting.

364
00:25:35,852 --> 00:25:37,232
[SPEAKER_10]: The last one was held at the McGlynn.

365
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:38,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Hundreds of people were there.

366
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:42,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And this issue is catching on where I think we could get close to that.

367
00:25:42,795 --> 00:25:47,837
[SPEAKER_10]: 490 units, not enough parking, a million dollars in linkage.

368
00:25:48,862 --> 00:25:49,462
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unheard of.

369
00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:52,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe that that was even being allowed.

370
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:53,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew it was thrown out there.

371
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,266
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew it was a request to the developer.

372
00:25:55,546 --> 00:26:01,690
[SPEAKER_10]: But I never in a million years would have ever believed that that reduction in linkage would be approved.

373
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:02,971
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to learn.

374
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:07,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there's any residents in the audience that can speak to the fact.

375
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:09,716
[SPEAKER_10]: The decision hasn't been in view.

376
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:14,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Whether it was that allegiance that a dispensation was granted?

377
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:18,950
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the rumors, and that's what I want to try to get to the bottom of.

378
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:19,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

379
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:21,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

380
00:26:23,592 --> 00:26:24,033
[SPEAKER_18]: You all set?

381
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:25,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Vice President?

382
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:26,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'd like to.

383
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:27,354
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

384
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:28,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening.

385
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:28,795
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.

386
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:31,036
[SPEAKER_19]: Please state your name and address for the record.

387
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:33,157
[SPEAKER_25]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

388
00:26:33,297 --> 00:26:35,258
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I'm a direct abutter to this project.

389
00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:37,439
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak.

390
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:46,063
[SPEAKER_25]: I went to the meeting last week, and the residents, first of all, I want to humanize the residents in that small scale residential neighborhood.

391
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:52,693
[SPEAKER_25]: that abuts this project, that's how they referred to us, the small-scale residential neighborhood.

392
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:54,934
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what Cumming Street was.

393
00:26:58,335 --> 00:27:00,956
[SPEAKER_25]: Four of the direct abutters down the street were there.

394
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:05,518
[SPEAKER_25]: They're all women, all senior citizens.

395
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:07,839
[SPEAKER_25]: Two of them have been in that neighborhood.

396
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:09,360
[SPEAKER_25]: They were second mothers to me.

397
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,681
[SPEAKER_25]: I take one of them to their doctor's appointments.

398
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:16,323
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want you to know that these people that directly abut this property,

399
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:23,290
[SPEAKER_25]: You may have opinions on me, that's fine, but they all showed up, these four women at the bottom of the street, all senior citizens.

400
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,511
[SPEAKER_25]: They're intimidated to speak.

401
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:30,594
[SPEAKER_25]: One of them didn't speak at all because she just, the process just intimidates her.

402
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:36,416
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm going to try to get them to come down to this open meeting next week if we can, so that they can have a voice.

403
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:41,559
[SPEAKER_25]: We had each three minutes a piece to speak on the issue and that wasn't enough time.

404
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:42,419
[SPEAKER_25]: This is 490 units.

405
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:47,806
[SPEAKER_25]: It's too big of a scale of a project in my neighborhood.

406
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,588
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm having a not in my backyard moment here.

407
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:52,890
[SPEAKER_25]: This is directly in my backyard.

408
00:27:53,710 --> 00:28:03,517
[SPEAKER_25]: And they designed it so that they could maximize the lot to put the most units in to get the most money out of this.

409
00:28:04,338 --> 00:28:06,159
[SPEAKER_25]: It's clear because they go all the way to the boundaries.

410
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,480
[SPEAKER_25]: They said that they were going to put in retail space.

411
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:12,283
[SPEAKER_25]: They said that they were going to have 7,000 square feet or something.

412
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,872
[SPEAKER_25]: And they are going to keep my bank, which is great.

413
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:15,873
[SPEAKER_25]: I go to Eastern Bank.

414
00:28:15,913 --> 00:28:16,793
[SPEAKER_25]: They're going to keep the bank.

415
00:28:17,914 --> 00:28:20,417
[SPEAKER_25]: But outside of that, they're going to have one or two more stores.

416
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:25,041
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not going to be completely storefronts on the bottom and then condos on top.

417
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,983
[SPEAKER_25]: That would benefit me as a neighbor.

418
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:29,685
[SPEAKER_25]: I wouldn't have as much of a problem with that.

419
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:33,668
[SPEAKER_25]: Put in a CVS or a Rite Aid or something that can be used by everybody.

420
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:34,729
[SPEAKER_25]: Put in a coffee shop.

421
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:35,369
[SPEAKER_25]: That would be good.

422
00:28:37,685 --> 00:28:40,248
[SPEAKER_25]: maybe 150 to 200 condos above it.

423
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:52,079
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that that's gonna blow their minds and that it impacts their bottom line, but they are business people, they are developers, and they're looking out for themselves and their bottom line.

424
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,944
[SPEAKER_25]: It's up to the zoning board to look out for us, the people of Medford that are here now.

425
00:28:57,544 --> 00:29:00,187
[SPEAKER_25]: This is just too large of a project.

426
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:06,725
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, if you put in 200 units, maybe it... I don't mind businesses on Locust Street.

427
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:12,707
[SPEAKER_25]: I've lived on Cumming Street all my life, and I have no problem with the businesses that are on Locust Street.

428
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:14,527
[SPEAKER_25]: Businesses don't bother me.

429
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:15,708
[SPEAKER_25]: They bring in money to the city.

430
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,649
[SPEAKER_25]: If they want to use it for business, please do.

431
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:20,229
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean commercial business.

432
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:21,709
[SPEAKER_25]: I have no problem with that.

433
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:22,870
[SPEAKER_25]: I've lived with it all my life.

434
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,051
[SPEAKER_25]: They bring in income for the city, and there's not as much traffic.

435
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:29,312
[SPEAKER_25]: But that aside, if you're going to put in

436
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:37,924
[SPEAKER_25]: condos, please make the whole bottom floor retail spaces and make it friendly for us to walk in and walk through.

437
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:49,908
[SPEAKER_25]: They want to keep the entrance to Cumming Street open to this project, and that's because they are going to have pedestrians and they are going to have bicyclists that need a safe road to go up to Riverside Ave.

438
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:54,069
[SPEAKER_25]: And we are very convenient for them to go up to Riverside Ave.

439
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:58,030
[SPEAKER_25]: So if I wanted to, I could talk to my residents, my people,

440
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:01,988
[SPEAKER_25]: and have them block it off with a fence, because it's legally their property.

441
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,169
[SPEAKER_25]: And they could fence it off.

442
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:05,290
[SPEAKER_25]: We could gate that off if we want to.

443
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,890
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to.

444
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,532
[SPEAKER_25]: We actually fought when, not Shaw's, but the Star Market went in there.

445
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:17,975
[SPEAKER_25]: And we fought to keep that pedestrian walkthrough so that it would benefit us to get to Shaw's, to get to the Star Market.

446
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:19,416
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to block it off.

447
00:30:19,716 --> 00:30:25,218
[SPEAKER_25]: But if they're going to block us off, why not block them off, just to not be nice neighbors?

448
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:26,779
[SPEAKER_25]: If they're not going to be nice neighbors, why should we?

449
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:33,192
[SPEAKER_25]: And so that's a lousy way to look at it, but that's how I feel.

450
00:30:33,392 --> 00:30:41,778
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel like this is being rammed through, rammed down my throat, and I'm going to be living with the consequences on Riverside Ave and Locust Street.

451
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:42,898
[SPEAKER_25]: The traffic is crazy.

452
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:49,263
[SPEAKER_25]: As it is, they should take out a couple of the businesses on Riverside Ave just so the buses and the trucks can get through.

453
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:51,104
[SPEAKER_25]: That is a trucking zone.

454
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:56,488
[SPEAKER_25]: Trucks and buses go down Locust Street from Riverside Ave, and they can hardly make that corner now.

455
00:30:57,309 --> 00:30:57,629
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

456
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:02,814
[SPEAKER_25]: So when you have all those cars, it's going to be backed up to, to, to, and wait until the casino comes in.

457
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:04,575
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just going to get really fun.

458
00:31:05,055 --> 00:31:12,602
[SPEAKER_25]: But, but, but that aside, that's casinos, you know, we, you don't have any say over the casino, but you do over this project.

459
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:14,703
[SPEAKER_25]: And I want you to scale down this project.

460
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:21,889
[SPEAKER_25]: I want the powers that be listen, these women that live down the street have been there for all their lives.

461
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,771
[SPEAKER_25]: They cook for me.

462
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:24,451
[SPEAKER_25]: I cut their grass.

463
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,032
[SPEAKER_25]: They cook for me.

464
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:25,452
[SPEAKER_25]: I love them.

465
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:27,711
[SPEAKER_25]: They are people.

466
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:33,338
[SPEAKER_25]: They are people and they're not a small-scale residential neighborhood.

467
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:38,204
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, you can have arguments with me all day long, but you can't argue with them.

468
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:42,609
[SPEAKER_25]: They've been in this city forever and they deserve to be respected.

469
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:43,250
[SPEAKER_25]: They came out.

470
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:45,229
[SPEAKER_25]: without my prompting.

471
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:48,150
[SPEAKER_25]: They got the letters, and they came out without my prompting.

472
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:54,412
[SPEAKER_25]: Now I'm going to let them know so that they can come down to speak and hopefully talk.

473
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:59,133
[SPEAKER_25]: But remember, these are old school people, and they're very intimidated by the whole process.

474
00:31:59,713 --> 00:32:01,394
[SPEAKER_25]: And they're intimidated, and they might not speak.

475
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:03,875
[SPEAKER_25]: They might be here, but they might not have the gumption to speak.

476
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,756
[SPEAKER_25]: So I hope their presence alone makes a statement.

477
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:09,176
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you very much for listening.

478
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:11,717
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Jean.

479
00:32:14,928 --> 00:32:15,388
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.

480
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:16,149
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

481
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:18,530
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't taken a name and address for the record.

482
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,611
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm Jean Nuzzo.

483
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:22,552
[SPEAKER_28]: I live at 35 Paris street.

484
00:32:23,172 --> 00:32:27,474
[SPEAKER_28]: I thank you for your time tonight to hear our concerns about this topic.

485
00:32:28,355 --> 00:32:33,417
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, first I'd like to tell you that I am a lifelong Medford resident by choice.

486
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:36,859
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I purposefully made the choice when it came time.

487
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,100
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

488
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,642
[SPEAKER_28]: I purposefully, how's that?

489
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:53,212
[SPEAKER_28]: So I purposefully made the choice to stay in Medford and it is my desire and intent to age here and remain here a lifelong resident.

490
00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:54,373
[SPEAKER_28]: I love this city.

491
00:32:55,473 --> 00:33:00,856
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm passionate about Medford and I am very passionate about construction and development.

492
00:33:01,036 --> 00:33:02,657
[SPEAKER_28]: It is what I do for a living.

493
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:09,280
[SPEAKER_28]: So to say I'm fully in support of responsible development of the city

494
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:11,886
[SPEAKER_28]: of Medford would be an understatement.

495
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:17,753
[SPEAKER_28]: I see our city as beautiful, even in its dusty and dirty state.

496
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:19,415
[SPEAKER_28]: I love it here.

497
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:27,785
[SPEAKER_28]: I do, however, believe that there are some people, rather than seeing Medford as a diamond

498
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:41,341
[SPEAKER_28]: that should be studied before it's cut apart and turned into something as merely the ugly sister who can't get a date so we should accept whatever developer comes in and wants to put a building up.

499
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:43,602
[SPEAKER_28]: And that is what this feels like to me.

500
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:53,885
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm confused as to why our Board of Appeals entertained this application for the duration that they did

501
00:33:55,925 --> 00:34:01,128
[SPEAKER_28]: or the amount of time that was given to them the night of the meeting.

502
00:34:01,688 --> 00:34:02,868
[SPEAKER_28]: We were there very late.

503
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:15,614
[SPEAKER_28]: They had the floor for a majority of the meeting, and when the residents got up to speak, I would say by about 10.30, they kind of cut off

504
00:34:16,164 --> 00:34:18,767
[SPEAKER_28]: folks because it was, in fact, getting late.

505
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:30,101
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'm confused as to why the application for the variance was considered because the request doesn't meet the requirements of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 48, Section 10.

506
00:34:31,183 --> 00:34:34,527
[SPEAKER_28]: The three arguments that they made are invalid.

507
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:42,323
[SPEAKER_28]: Their arguments were that they needed relief because the property was brownfield property, but they purchased it that way.

508
00:34:43,063 --> 00:34:50,906
[SPEAKER_28]: They made the argument that because of the groundwater underneath, they could not put underground parking, so they had to build the structure higher.

509
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:58,208
[SPEAKER_28]: However, they could do as they're doing on Rivers Edge, the new development by Davis.

510
00:34:58,928 --> 00:35:00,769
[SPEAKER_28]: They're doing what they call a Texas wrap.

511
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:07,610
[SPEAKER_28]: So they put the parking in the middle and the units around the perimeter so you don't have to go into the ground at all.

512
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:16,753
[SPEAKER_28]: And then the third position I heard from them was that they could not find a commercial solution for the property.

513
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:27,650
[SPEAKER_28]: that they had looked but nobody was interested because of the Wegmans building going across the street and because of its location.

514
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:37,054
[SPEAKER_28]: Although Assembly Row, which has 441 units and 256,000 square feet of retail space is going into its phase two development and will gain another 157,000.

515
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:49,950
[SPEAKER_28]: putting it just shy of 500,000 square feet of retail space.

516
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:56,735
[SPEAKER_28]: They, if they could find a way to build more buildings and put more retail, they could lease more space.

517
00:35:57,396 --> 00:36:03,601
[SPEAKER_28]: So I would ask, and I did ask, why then they couldn't find more retail?

518
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:09,726
[SPEAKER_28]: In addition to that, the city of Cambridge has a deficit of life science property.

519
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:14,690
[SPEAKER_28]: And there is a outward migration, not only of residents,

520
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:26,804
[SPEAKER_28]: but of Cambridge businesses in the smaller life science groups that are moving out to Somerville and Belmont and Watertown, which are all further away than Medford.

521
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:35,806
[SPEAKER_28]: So I would argue that their positions were perhaps not as well thought out of what the marketplace would actually bear.

522
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:42,307
[SPEAKER_28]: I think there's good opportunity for Medford to avail themselves of this potential type of development.

523
00:36:43,784 --> 00:37:02,060
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd also like to point out for your consideration that although the abutters will be impacted and they were in attendance, those that were there expressed the fact that they were never provided an opportunity to participate in the development or provide feedback on any portion of the design of that unit.

524
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:08,445
[SPEAKER_28]: The first time they were seeing it was either at the community development meeting or at

525
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:14,388
[SPEAKER_28]: at the variance application meeting, that hearing that we were in attendance.

526
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:15,789
[SPEAKER_28]: And I did attend both.

527
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:17,450
[SPEAKER_28]: I attended the development board meeting.

528
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,851
[SPEAKER_28]: I attended the board of appeals meeting.

529
00:37:23,113 --> 00:37:29,798
[SPEAKER_28]: In both instances, residents expressed the desire to reject this application and that it wasn't good for the city.

530
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:35,141
[SPEAKER_28]: And in both instances, everybody was looking to come to

531
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:42,533
[SPEAKER_28]: a compromise, asking them to make it smaller, to design it more to the intent of what Medford architecture looks like.

532
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:46,386
[SPEAKER_28]: a bit belligerent.

533
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:52,170
[SPEAKER_28]: They were very sure they were going to get their variance and they didn't really care to listen to what Medford residents had to say.

534
00:37:53,271 --> 00:38:14,867
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd also like to point out that I think true public hearings are critical because although this affects the abutters, it affects the city, not just from a traffic perspective, but if we have this unit come in this large, that doesn't consider a strategic plan for the city of Medford.

535
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:20,812
[SPEAKER_28]: We are inviting other developers of this type to come in.

536
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:34,216
[SPEAKER_28]: And we miss the opportunity to work with some of the big developers that I'm feeling certain would be interested that have helped to develop some really landmark properties around the greater Boston area.

537
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:43,658
[SPEAKER_28]: We should really be looking to benefit from what they're calling the urban edge or the urban ring outward migration.

538
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:45,966
[SPEAKER_28]: We are centrally located.

539
00:38:46,547 --> 00:38:49,849
[SPEAKER_28]: We, you know, real estate, location, location, location.

540
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:56,575
[SPEAKER_28]: So we can either just take whatever comes our way, or we can really be mindful.

541
00:38:57,315 --> 00:39:03,280
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'd like you to, if you've seen, I'm hoping you guys have all seen the rendering, it's a very tall building.

542
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,682
[SPEAKER_28]: It's 75 feet or so tall.

543
00:39:06,482 --> 00:39:11,466
[SPEAKER_28]: It's glass, but the perimeter of the building matches the perimeter of the property.

544
00:39:11,987 --> 00:39:13,648
[SPEAKER_28]: There are few trees at the front.

545
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:18,298
[SPEAKER_28]: but the true courtyard space is reserved specifically for residents.

546
00:39:19,158 --> 00:39:27,161
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd like you to consider developments like that on High Street and Salem Street and Mystic Ave and Riverside Ave.

547
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:39,504
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd like you to consider that if we let this unit go through, we are sending a signal to this type of developer that they can come in and put those units wherever they see fit.

548
00:39:39,884 --> 00:39:42,825
[SPEAKER_28]: Now certainly, I know that some people don't

549
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:44,972
[SPEAKER_28]: like station landing.

550
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:47,453
[SPEAKER_28]: It didn't turn out the way that we were all promised.

551
00:39:48,014 --> 00:39:51,776
[SPEAKER_28]: But where it was located, it was not an eyesore.

552
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:54,137
[SPEAKER_28]: There was nothing there.

553
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:59,841
[SPEAKER_28]: So what it was was better than a big barren field.

554
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:06,625
[SPEAKER_28]: But in these instances, we would be losing real estate opportunities to these huge developments.

555
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:12,428
[SPEAKER_28]: And I understand the need for housing, but I think that there's a balance that we should look to

556
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:32,225
[SPEAKER_28]: attain and I urge you all to consider that and I would urge the people, residents sitting behind me in attendance and if there are folks watching at home, I would urge them to think about that and think about if this is their vision for the city of Medford.

557
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:36,409
[SPEAKER_28]: And if not, I call you to action because now is the time.

558
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:38,591
[SPEAKER_28]: If we do not step forward

559
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:51,286
[SPEAKER_28]: and say, not in this way, not without purpose, then these developers will come, and Medford will be another type of city, and it may not be the type of city we want it to be.

560
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,307
[SPEAKER_28]: So I thank you for your time.

561
00:40:53,888 --> 00:41:02,475
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd urge you to put forth a letter requesting the board to withhold a final judgment until the general public truly gets to speak on the matter.

562
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:03,216
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

563
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:12,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

564
00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:13,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

565
00:41:13,729 --> 00:41:16,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I thank Councilor Longo for bringing this forward.

566
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:27,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've all either heard, either through the social media, people about the project and how large it is and people's concerns about it.

567
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:36,461
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, in my short time here, in my four years, five years here, other companies have had the courtesy to come before this board and show us their plans of what they're going to do.

568
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:39,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wish this company had the same

569
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:46,036
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would hope that all companies coming into the city would have the courtesy to come before this board and at least give us the opportunity to see what they're going to be doing.

570
00:41:46,676 --> 00:42:06,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a problem and I understand our options here are limited what we can do, but the same appeal board denied a project which was of much smaller size for parking reasons and similar to this.

571
00:42:09,015 --> 00:42:12,217
[SPEAKER_11]: and which made the building owner unhappy.

572
00:42:13,518 --> 00:42:21,024
[SPEAKER_11]: In this project, you know, we talk about affordable housing, they're only giving us 3% of affordable housing out of this here.

573
00:42:21,044 --> 00:42:24,106
[SPEAKER_11]: From what I understand, there's only going to be 14 units of affordable housing?

574
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:24,106
14.

575
00:42:25,607 --> 00:42:35,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's, I think we should be getting more affordable housing out of this, which is another, but again,

576
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:49,864
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, this property is also zoned industrial, and it's time that we look at our zoning laws and maybe start looking at changing them to the current times, Mr. President.

577
00:42:49,904 --> 00:42:57,432
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I thank Council Member for bringing this up, and maybe they're moving a little too fast, but again, and I know our options are limited here.

578
00:43:05,864 --> 00:43:07,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falcone.

579
00:43:07,725 --> 00:43:08,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

580
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:13,328
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to also thank Councilor Longo for bringing this up tonight as well.

581
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:20,131
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been one of my major concerns as being elected.

582
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:28,315
[SPEAKER_07]: And I made a resolution earlier in the year, back in March, that we need to take a complete look and review our zoning.

583
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:32,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's at the point now where Mefford has become very desirable, which is great.

584
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:37,389
[SPEAKER_07]: We have all kinds of developers that want to come in and do whatever they want.

585
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a problem.

586
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm for development.

587
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:41,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I like development.

588
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:44,131
[SPEAKER_07]: But it needs to be smart development.

589
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:45,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be well thought out.

590
00:43:46,432 --> 00:43:48,353
[SPEAKER_07]: We are in a great location.

591
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:49,353
[SPEAKER_07]: We're close to Boston.

592
00:43:49,473 --> 00:43:51,654
[SPEAKER_07]: But development needs to be thought out.

593
00:43:52,074 --> 00:43:55,875
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a lot of our zoning is outdated.

594
00:43:56,116 --> 00:43:57,036
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be looked at.

595
00:43:57,396 --> 00:44:03,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're at the point now where we've let it go for so long that trying to reel it in is going to be pretty tough.

596
00:44:04,082 --> 00:44:09,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a resolution to take a look at complete zoning for the city of Medford.

597
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:10,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an expensive endeavor.

598
00:44:10,804 --> 00:44:31,909
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably costs probably maybe about a quarter of a million dollars, but I think in my mind, it's probably money well spent because we are at a pivotal moment now where we have a lot of developers coming in and we're either gonna go in a direction where we're gonna just develop all over the place or we're gonna put on the brakes and say, wait a minute, we need to actually have a master plan

599
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,638
[SPEAKER_07]: as to where we want our city to go.

600
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,760
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really think that we need to take a look at this.

601
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,782
[SPEAKER_07]: My opinion, I will be honest with you, I think it's too big.

602
00:44:41,783 --> 00:44:47,508
[SPEAKER_07]: 492 units in that neighborhood with Wegmans coming in, a casino down the road.

603
00:44:48,388 --> 00:44:50,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the traffic, it's a two-lane road now.

604
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine the traffic when you have 492 units of Wegmans

605
00:44:56,018 --> 00:44:59,581
[SPEAKER_07]: the casino and just the traffic that we have in that neighborhood now.

606
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:00,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be out of control.

607
00:45:01,503 --> 00:45:03,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I recommended early in the year that we hire a traffic engineer.

608
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:05,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not in the budget this year.

609
00:45:06,348 --> 00:45:06,949
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not in the budget.

610
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:08,970
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a traffic engineer now more than ever.

611
00:45:10,432 --> 00:45:13,074
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're going to have development, it has to be thought out.

612
00:45:14,436 --> 00:45:16,798
[SPEAKER_07]: The way I look at this, this has not been well thought out.

613
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:23,280
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to come in, they're going to try to build this huge development, and this is going to be a major problem for everyone in this city.

614
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not just in that neighborhood.

615
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,641
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually have traffic nightmares everywhere.

616
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:29,602
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of concerns here.

617
00:45:29,622 --> 00:45:30,582
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to be addressed.

618
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,662
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to be addressed now.

619
00:45:32,382 --> 00:45:36,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the resolution I had with regard to zoning went to the zoning subcommittee.

620
00:45:36,844 --> 00:45:42,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we've had one meeting on it so far, and we'll have more to look at it, you know, again.

621
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:44,906
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's something that we need to act on now.

622
00:45:45,832 --> 00:45:49,473
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank Councilor Longo for bringing this forward.

623
00:45:49,733 --> 00:45:53,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's, you know, the citizens need to speak up about this.

624
00:45:54,314 --> 00:45:55,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone should have a chance to weigh in.

625
00:45:56,634 --> 00:46:05,116
[SPEAKER_07]: With regard to the project that Donna, I believe Councilor Carviello mentioned earlier at 7 Canal, I was against that one as well.

626
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually spoke up on it at the meeting.

627
00:46:09,377 --> 00:46:10,637
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how strongly I feel about it.

628
00:46:10,817 --> 00:46:15,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not, it's not that I'm against development, but it needs to be smart, well thought out development.

629
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:19,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of these developers will come in and say, well, it's going to be transit-oriented.

630
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,352
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to walk to Wellington Station.

631
00:46:22,672 --> 00:46:23,932
[SPEAKER_07]: They cannot guarantee that.

632
00:46:24,412 --> 00:46:29,173
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't guarantee that people are not going to have cars and that they're going to walk to Wellington Station.

633
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:33,715
[SPEAKER_07]: They always claim, well, they're millennials, and millennials don't own cars.

634
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:35,635
[SPEAKER_07]: They take public transit everywhere.

635
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:38,316
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they were trying to sell us in the project at Seven Canals.

636
00:46:39,316 --> 00:46:40,036
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not true.

637
00:46:41,737 --> 00:46:42,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I know plenty of millennials.

638
00:46:42,977 --> 00:46:45,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a millennial, but I know plenty of them, and they all own cars.

639
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:51,404
[SPEAKER_07]: They all need a place, they all need a way to get somewhere other than public transportation.

640
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:54,166
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, you know, we are at a pivotal point.

641
00:46:54,906 --> 00:46:57,629
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank Councilor Longo-Kern for bringing this up.

642
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:00,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is something that the residents should weigh in on.

643
00:47:01,912 --> 00:47:07,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I welcome their thoughts and opinions on this and, you know, I look forward to talking about this issue.

644
00:47:07,556 --> 00:47:10,239
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will be honest with you, I feel it's too big for the neighborhood.

645
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:11,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

646
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,041
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor.

647
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

648
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:16,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

649
00:47:16,727 --> 00:47:18,508
[SPEAKER_22]: And I want to thank also Councilor Longo.

650
00:47:19,228 --> 00:47:22,429
[SPEAKER_22]: And I want to thank some of the residents for coming down tonight.

651
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,050
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, this is nothing more than just pure greed.

652
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:37,814
[SPEAKER_22]: The size of the project, without any hesitation, is purely based on how they can cram the most units in and the biggest bang for their buck.

653
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:41,155
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's without any regards to infrastructure improvements.

654
00:47:41,555 --> 00:47:43,956
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't heard anything about infrastructure improvements.

655
00:47:44,386 --> 00:47:50,268
[SPEAKER_22]: Tonight we were talking in budget regarding some of the concerns we hear on Riverside Ave.

656
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:56,490
[SPEAKER_22]: I happen to live off of Riverside Ave, so I'm fighting that traffic almost on a daily basis.

657
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:07,073
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can tell you, when you're coming down Riverside Ave, going to the square, right before you get to Locust Street, the cars queue up from Locust Street to the new Panera.

658
00:48:07,613 --> 00:48:09,774
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a nightly religious thing now.

659
00:48:10,094 --> 00:48:13,935
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to wait in 15 minutes of traffic just to get up to Locust Street.

660
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:15,994
[SPEAKER_22]: The other side is the same.

661
00:48:16,414 --> 00:48:18,315
[SPEAKER_22]: The cars queue up on the other side.

662
00:48:18,655 --> 00:48:26,640
[SPEAKER_22]: So clearly, this development is not in it for anything other than getting the biggest bang for their buck.

663
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,121
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, you talk about transit-oriented.

664
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:36,846
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, living in the area, I live on Wellington Road, but I could actually walk across the street to Station Landing.

665
00:48:37,286 --> 00:48:39,367
[SPEAKER_22]: But let me tell you, and I advise my kids also,

666
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:45,303
[SPEAKER_22]: You never cross any of those streets because you risk your life crossing those streets.

667
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:55,346
[SPEAKER_22]: So if they want to sell these seven, $800,000 condos or these $3,000 a month units and tell people they're going to be able to walk to Wellington, good luck to them.

668
00:48:55,986 --> 00:48:59,347
[SPEAKER_22]: They better sign a big health insurance policy because

669
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:03,449
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me tell you, that's not going to be an easy task walking to Wellington.

670
00:49:04,669 --> 00:49:11,432
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it was mentioned also about this community not being in front of the curve.

671
00:49:12,093 --> 00:49:18,936
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, I'd have to state, our Office of Community Development consists of one director and one part-time person.

672
00:49:20,096 --> 00:49:22,557
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what the Office of Community Development consists of.

673
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:26,039
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, if you look at the Green Line extension where

674
00:49:26,382 --> 00:49:28,064
[SPEAKER_22]: Mephitt had no seat at the table.

675
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:35,491
[SPEAKER_22]: If you look at any development in the city, it allows the developers to come in and the city takes a back seat.

676
00:49:35,811 --> 00:49:37,773
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's exactly what happened in this project.

677
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:39,795
[SPEAKER_22]: The speaker prior was exactly right.

678
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:46,822
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no one out there from the city administration looking out for the interests of the residents.

679
00:49:47,388 --> 00:49:54,290
[SPEAKER_22]: And let me tell you, Madam Mayor, who was quoted in the paper saying, this is great for the community, that she's excited about it, and so forth.

680
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,811
[SPEAKER_22]: People live in that area, Madam Mayor.

681
00:49:56,931 --> 00:50:00,292
[SPEAKER_22]: You may not think so, but people actually live in that area.

682
00:50:01,012 --> 00:50:12,476
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, the whole talk about quality of life, whether you live on Placelet Road, or if you live on Cummings, or if you live on Riverside Ave or Parish Street, quality of life is the same throughout the community.

683
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:19,931
[SPEAKER_22]: So whether you're about a commercial district or live in purely a residential district, you have that same right for quality of life.

684
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:30,896
[SPEAKER_22]: And to think that there's no residents that live in this area, and geez, we're putting in an area that really no one's going to notice, is being shortsighted, in my opinion.

685
00:50:31,197 --> 00:50:41,302
[SPEAKER_22]: I like the idea of asking the board, because we have no control over the board, but asking them to hold off their final judgment until there is a full

686
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:43,213
[SPEAKER_22]: public hearing where people can attend.

687
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:50,756
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, I've never seen, since I've been on the council, the number of variances issued for a project.

688
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:51,897
[SPEAKER_22]: It's unheard of.

689
00:50:52,577 --> 00:50:55,799
[SPEAKER_22]: I've never seen that number of variance issued.

690
00:50:56,359 --> 00:51:09,405
[SPEAKER_22]: And to stick a project in where, you know, we have Wegmans, you know, the Shaw site, for a number of years, people probably heard the rumors a market basket was going to go into the Shaw site.

691
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:18,564
[SPEAKER_22]: And people of the community, because Market Basket has very competitive prices, were welcoming Market Basket into the community.

692
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:23,868
[SPEAKER_22]: And from what I heard, the owners of the property, for whatever reason, kept Market Basket out.

693
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:25,530
[SPEAKER_22]: They didn't want Market Basket in there.

694
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,452
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of the other shopping markets didn't want the competition.

695
00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:45,219
[SPEAKER_22]: and now we're stuck with 490 units, of which my kids won't be able to afford, your kids won't be able to afford, and many people in this community are priced out of even the affordable units you can't afford in these particular buildings.

696
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:56,568
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, when we sold the old schools back some years ago, we went to centralized schools, we had the unique opportunity with city-owned buildings to use for purposes we needed in the community.

697
00:51:58,396 --> 00:52:00,697
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, there are purposes in the community right now.

698
00:52:01,097 --> 00:52:07,378
[SPEAKER_22]: If you have a senior parent that lives in the community and they need assisted living, guess what?

699
00:52:07,638 --> 00:52:11,019
[SPEAKER_22]: You got to send them out to Reading, Andover, not Method.

700
00:52:11,399 --> 00:52:12,780
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't offer that in Method.

701
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,540
[SPEAKER_22]: You got to send your parents outside somewhere else.

702
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:16,801
[SPEAKER_22]: Senior housing.

703
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,821
[SPEAKER_22]: When seniors call me up and say, I'd love to get into senior housing.

704
00:52:20,502 --> 00:52:25,483
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, ma'am, I'm sorry to tell you, you may be 75 years old, but there's a five-year wait.

705
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:31,069
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, these are the issues that we're confronted with in the community that we don't have.

706
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:43,033
[SPEAKER_22]: And if the city had some vision for assisted living, senior housing, more affordable housing, these are the things I think that we should have given direction to and maybe offered incentives.

707
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:54,777
[SPEAKER_22]: I realize it's private property, but offer a tax incentive asking that anyone would like to bid on assisted living would get whatever tax reduction to come into the community.

708
00:52:55,337 --> 00:53:03,483
[SPEAKER_22]: These are the benefits we see, and just adding housing for the sake of adding housing over and over again really is doing nothing for our community.

709
00:53:04,043 --> 00:53:13,390
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really, when you think about it, if anything, you're doing away with the commercial, who pays a higher tax rate, you're bringing in residential, which pays a lower tax rate,

710
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:21,354
[SPEAKER_22]: Eventually, when all our commercial areas are dried up to housing, which that's the way we're going, your property tax is going to go through the roof.

711
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:23,475
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me tell you, your property tax.

712
00:53:23,735 --> 00:53:32,580
[SPEAKER_22]: And we already heard from the city assessor last night that the assessments are going way up again, which is another thing we're going to have to tackle soon.

713
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,622
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, Mr. President, I thank Councillor Lungo for offering this.

714
00:53:37,362 --> 00:53:42,205
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope this is not the end, but the beginning of some discussion and dialogue.

715
00:53:42,898 --> 00:53:53,847
[SPEAKER_22]: I know within the budget, the Office of Community Development, the Board of Appeals asked the mayor for an increase in their stipend because they work so hard.

716
00:53:54,588 --> 00:53:55,969
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm not doubting they work hard.

717
00:53:56,289 --> 00:54:01,554
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that board does do a lot of work and, you know, they work very hard.

718
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:05,457
[SPEAKER_22]: But I would say, Mr. President, at this particular time,

719
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:15,558
[SPEAKER_22]: that I would hope that the board hold back on their final judgment until this is open and notorious throughout the entire community.

720
00:54:16,678 --> 00:54:18,359
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no reason to ramrod this.

721
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:33,343
[SPEAKER_22]: Give people enough ample time to digest it, see what's going on, talk about infrastructure improvements, talk about lighting improvements in the area, pedestrian safety that we've been talking about, talk about ways that maybe we can reduce traffic flow in the area,

722
00:54:34,115 --> 00:54:36,877
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, their traffic report said no traffic impact.

723
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:38,797
[SPEAKER_22]: Traffic impact?

724
00:54:39,478 --> 00:54:46,241
[SPEAKER_22]: You're creating 743 parking spots, 490 units, no traffic impact.

725
00:54:46,962 --> 00:54:48,022
[SPEAKER_22]: I find that hard to believe.

726
00:54:48,062 --> 00:54:57,847
[SPEAKER_22]: I turn on the news tonight, Channel 5, they said over the next few years, there's going to be an additional 80,000 cars on the road because of the housing market in this particular area.

727
00:54:59,437 --> 00:55:12,220
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, they're talking about congestion already in the roads, coupled with that, coupled with these giant projects, you know, we're just, we're gonna kill the quality of life in this community, and we're gonna get nothing in return.

728
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:26,683
[SPEAKER_22]: We got nothing in return for station landing, our taxes didn't go down, our city services didn't improve, and now we're gonna add a giant other project, yeah, and we're gonna get a million dollars in, what's the, linkage money.

729
00:55:27,379 --> 00:55:28,339
[SPEAKER_22]: which goes to the city.

730
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:34,842
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to get a million dollars in linkage, and the mayor's going to have a ball spending the linkage money, along with the council president.

731
00:55:35,122 --> 00:55:37,162
[SPEAKER_22]: There's three people that spend the linkage money.

732
00:55:37,803 --> 00:55:54,448
[SPEAKER_22]: And other than that, we're not going to get any benefits, other than the additional traffic, the additional smog in the city, and the addition of, in my opinion, housing that we're already overhoused in this community, and we need better use and utilization of what we currently have.

733
00:55:54,788 --> 00:55:56,209
[SPEAKER_22]: So I thank you, Mr. President, for the time.

734
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,251
[SPEAKER_19]: No, thank you, Councilor.

735
00:55:58,511 --> 00:55:59,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

736
00:56:00,272 --> 00:56:01,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

737
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:03,454
[SPEAKER_16]: I, too, am opposed to the project.

738
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:05,195
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel as though the scope is far too large.

739
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:20,383
[SPEAKER_16]: The impact that it's going to have on traffic, the potential impact it could have on our public schools, the certain impact that it's going to have on the quality of life of the surrounding neighborhood, as well as the lack of affordable units certainly make this a project that I feel as though something that I can't personally support.

740
00:56:21,604 --> 00:56:23,585
[SPEAKER_16]: However, this matter is not something that's before the council.

741
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:34,166
[SPEAKER_16]: And I, for one, would certainly support and stand away from trying to influence unduly the decision that the Zoning Board of Appeals makes.

742
00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:39,689
[SPEAKER_16]: However, the matter that's before this council doesn't ask the Zoning Board of Appeals to oppose the project or to approve the project.

743
00:56:40,089 --> 00:56:44,811
[SPEAKER_16]: The matter asks for the Zoning Board of Appeals to delay its decision until more community input can be made.

744
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:47,392
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's something, Mr. President, that I can certainly support.

745
00:56:48,352 --> 00:56:52,774
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel as though that the Zoning Board of Appeals should operate free from or under influence, but I also feel as though

746
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:58,054
[SPEAKER_16]: The decisions that they're making have a direct and significant impact on the quality of life of the residents in this community.

747
00:56:59,035 --> 00:57:05,320
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing that I haven't heard any of my colleagues talk about is, with an addition of 790 units, there's going to be a need to provide additional city services.

748
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:14,027
[SPEAKER_16]: And although we've seen an improvement in the way we've been providing services in recent weeks, in recent months, I don't think we have the capacity to deal with that as well right now.

749
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:21,593
[SPEAKER_16]: The impact that it's going to have on our actual underground and aboveground infrastructure, Mr. President, is something that's going to have to be looked at a little bit more.

750
00:57:22,285 --> 00:57:22,845
[SPEAKER_16]: with scrutiny.

751
00:57:22,965 --> 00:57:30,527
[SPEAKER_16]: So for those reasons, Mr. President, I am going to be in support of this resolution, asking that the Zoning Board of Appeals delays this decision until a public hearing can be heard.

752
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:32,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, councillor.

753
00:57:32,728 --> 00:57:34,928
[SPEAKER_20]: Chair recognizes Councillor Falco.

754
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:36,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

755
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:45,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to amend the resolution to get a report back with the, to find out what the variances that were requested are.

756
00:57:48,192 --> 00:57:51,453
[SPEAKER_19]: Report back an amendment on this

757
00:57:52,403 --> 00:58:04,708
[SPEAKER_19]: paper which is offered under suspension of the vice-president Long and Kern that amended by Councilor Falco that we receive a report back on how many and what were the variances requested.

758
00:58:04,968 --> 00:58:05,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

759
00:58:05,668 --> 00:58:07,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess which ones were approved.

760
00:58:07,649 --> 00:58:08,989
[SPEAKER_19]: And which ones were approved.

761
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:11,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

762
00:58:15,152 --> 00:58:15,432
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it?

763
00:58:16,232 --> 00:58:16,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

764
00:58:16,632 --> 00:58:17,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

765
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:19,213
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much Councilor.

766
00:58:19,253 --> 00:58:21,294
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

767
00:58:22,094 --> 00:58:22,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

768
00:58:23,535 --> 00:58:29,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I, too, thank Vice President Longwood-Curran for bringing this forward.

769
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:46,708
[SPEAKER_02]: That area alone is, I believe I made a resolution a few months back when this was discussed about, I know Councilor Knight brought it up a bit, but the impact on the McGlynn and the Columbus schools.

770
00:58:47,308 --> 00:58:50,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're talking about 400 and some odd units,

771
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:55,456
[SPEAKER_02]: and families coming in, the impact that'll make and that's in the school department.

772
00:58:56,096 --> 00:59:00,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we still hadn't heard anything and what kind of an impact that would make.

773
00:59:00,477 --> 00:59:14,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I too echo the remarks of council Falco and understanding where we want to go as a community and having a plan in place of our vision, whether it be two year or four year or 10 year.

774
00:59:14,941 --> 00:59:18,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I believe that's what neighboring communities have done and looking in

775
00:59:19,788 --> 00:59:20,949
[SPEAKER_02]: the direction they want to go.

776
00:59:21,029 --> 00:59:31,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I too have heard the stories in the last week that, you know, the new auto mile on Mystic Ave and what we could have done there as development.

777
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:48,148
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand that I also agree with Councilor Knight that the Board of Appeals has their own process, but I think that we need a voice from the community to share their thoughts and their concerns because

778
00:59:49,293 --> 00:59:54,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a major concern, I think, for me, is the safety of that area.

779
00:59:54,735 --> 01:00:02,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about cut-throughs and traffic issues and the heights and the cut-throughs and how dangerous the areas are.

780
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:09,541
[SPEAKER_02]: What frightens me is how crazy that area is at the McGlynn School.

781
01:00:09,601 --> 01:00:16,084
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked about that being not a commuter school at a time when we were on the school committee.

782
01:00:16,773 --> 01:00:25,094
[SPEAKER_02]: and the number of cars, and lack of parking, and the congestion in that area, and the effect it's going to have on the educational piece.

783
01:00:25,214 --> 01:00:27,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it needs to be weighed.

784
01:00:27,395 --> 01:00:40,297
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, I thank my colleagues, and it's good to see the community stand up and have that love of Medford and passion to see the other directions it might go in.

785
01:00:40,557 --> 01:00:41,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you.

786
01:00:43,117 --> 01:00:44,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

787
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:46,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

788
01:00:46,845 --> 01:00:47,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, Mr. President, thank you.

789
01:00:47,826 --> 01:00:49,267
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to further amend the paper as well.

790
01:00:49,487 --> 01:00:56,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I'd like to ask that the zoning administrator report back to the city council as to what the current zoning is at the site, what the conforming uses are.

791
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:09,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Further amended by council night that the zoning administrator, um, report back to the city council as to what the zoning, how the property is now zoned and,

792
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:19,482
[SPEAKER_16]: How the property is now zoned and... How the property is now zoned and what the conforming uses are currently based upon a zoning table.

793
01:01:19,502 --> 01:01:20,623
[SPEAKER_19]: And what the conforming uses are.

794
01:01:21,423 --> 01:01:24,445
[SPEAKER_19]: And the zoning officer would be the... Building Commissioner.

795
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:25,425
[SPEAKER_19]: Building Commissioner.

796
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:26,406
[SPEAKER_19]: My apologies.

797
01:01:26,426 --> 01:01:35,471
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm done.

798
01:01:36,332 --> 01:01:37,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you all set, Councillor?

799
01:01:37,292 --> 01:01:37,692
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I am.

800
01:01:38,393 --> 01:01:40,134
[SPEAKER_19]: The Chair recognizes Vice President Longo.

801
01:01:40,174 --> 01:01:42,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Just briefly, I know there's people that want to speak.

802
01:01:42,692 --> 01:01:49,175
[SPEAKER_10]: While we're making our amendments, I just want to ask if Councillor Carviello offered that the developer come before us.

803
01:01:49,435 --> 01:01:52,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure that's in the official record.

804
01:01:52,557 --> 01:01:52,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

805
01:01:52,857 --> 01:01:54,617
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you get that as a resolution?

806
01:01:56,578 --> 01:01:56,979
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you did.

807
01:01:58,419 --> 01:02:00,680
[SPEAKER_19]: That he asked for the developer to come.

808
01:02:01,201 --> 01:02:02,181
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was an amendment.

809
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:03,161
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize, Councillor.

810
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:04,182
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't catch it as such.

811
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,000
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.

812
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:13,582
[SPEAKER_19]: Please state your name and address for the record.

813
01:02:14,503 --> 01:02:15,484
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Robert Penter.

814
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:19,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at zero summit road, Medford mass, a former member of this August body.

815
01:02:19,908 --> 01:02:23,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, to get to council night's question brought up at the council, at the, uh, appeals meeting.

816
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:26,133
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an industrially zoned piece of property.

817
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:30,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, and it's 490 units that are being asked over there.

818
01:02:30,436 --> 01:02:35,240
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 11 variances that were being presented, 11 variances more than any other time.

819
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,822
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe all 11 of them were asking for relief.

820
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to the preliminary decision, they've been granted.

821
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:44,956
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an awful lot of variances on a one single piece of property.

822
01:02:46,238 --> 01:02:51,002
[SPEAKER_00]: I think folks really need to understand something, that that night on that, it was an extremely hard night.

823
01:02:51,903 --> 01:03:01,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And the residents that were there, they waited all night long to make sure that their comments were made, while the developer took as much time as needed, and rightfully so, to present their position.

824
01:03:01,772 --> 01:03:04,393
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were some comments that some folks still wanted to make.

825
01:03:04,433 --> 01:03:10,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, at the very end, they weren't allowed to because I don't know if it was because of the time or for whatever the reasons might be.

826
01:03:11,296 --> 01:03:15,658
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are two sites and sections of our own municipal laws that need to be reviewed.

827
01:03:16,398 --> 01:03:23,421
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Chapter 94, Section 1, which is our zoning ordinance, which says that the change cannot cause congestion or confusion.

828
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:26,723
[SPEAKER_00]: And also under our site plan review under Section 94, Section 33.1,

829
01:03:31,439 --> 01:03:36,746
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, section 331, it states that the community, the neighborhood has to be taken into consideration.

830
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it compatible with the neighborhood as it relates to this?

831
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:43,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just think of the traffic on the traffic issue alone.

832
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:48,570
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start off with the new Lumineers, which is 160 units.

833
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the ice skating rink.

834
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have across the street, you have Coles and Marshalls.

835
01:03:53,352 --> 01:03:54,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to have the new Wegmans.

836
01:03:55,092 --> 01:03:59,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to have 490 units if that goes through, 7,000 square feet of office space.

837
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:07,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to have, going down the street a little bit further, two office buildings, and I think there's six remaining commercial pieces of property.

838
01:04:07,996 --> 01:04:12,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that and then go to Wellington Circle, where 200 more units of affordable housing

839
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,156
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be taking place and coming on.

840
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:26,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just imagine in the middle of the day, 8, 9, 10, weekends, night times, whatever it might be, taking into consideration once the new casino comes in.

841
01:04:27,602 --> 01:04:34,726
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Riverside Avenue, you have Locust Street, Mystic Valley Parkway, Harvard Street, and all the side streets that spin off of that.

842
01:04:35,766 --> 01:04:38,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you realize how much traffic that that's going to cause?

843
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:43,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And for them to say it has no traffic input makes absolutely no sense at all.

844
01:04:43,785 --> 01:04:51,787
[SPEAKER_00]: I would respectfully ask whoever made that request for next Tuesday night to ask how they made that determination of no traffic input.

845
01:04:52,387 --> 01:04:58,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the developer himself acknowledged that on an annual basis, at a minimum of 1%, traffic will increase.

846
01:04:58,808 --> 01:05:03,109
[SPEAKER_00]: And they acknowledged by their own development that traffic will increase in that particular area.

847
01:05:03,689 --> 01:05:06,610
[SPEAKER_00]: But to get back to what you were talking about, smart growth, Councilor Falco.

848
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:11,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years ago, I made an offering regarding growth and development here in this community.

849
01:05:11,612 --> 01:05:14,194
[SPEAKER_00]: for which we didn't have any review with the prior administration.

850
01:05:14,914 --> 01:05:21,278
[SPEAKER_00]: We asked for a moratorium for which at that point in time the council was in favor of, but the city's administration never went forward with it.

851
01:05:21,878 --> 01:05:31,804
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no development that takes place in any part of this city that can tell you it's going to work, whether it be smart or not, whether it be compatible or not.

852
01:05:32,784 --> 01:05:39,228
[SPEAKER_00]: This development that's taking place down there off of Riverside Avenue in the Wellington area has an environmental impact.

853
01:05:40,022 --> 01:05:41,903
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a community impact.

854
01:05:42,163 --> 01:05:43,624
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a neighborhood impact.

855
01:05:44,424 --> 01:06:09,498
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the development that's taking place by this developer wanting 490 units and a full packed room of residents that were there, and you go back a month prior to, and you look at the 40 units to a four-story building in West Medford that didn't have anywhere near the amount of complete neighborhood support for not wanting the project, how can you say one gets supported and one doesn't?

856
01:06:10,421 --> 01:06:11,402
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't fit well.

857
01:06:11,502 --> 01:06:12,322
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't bode well.

858
01:06:12,342 --> 01:06:18,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that the majority of almost every one of you councilors are on board for not only having the meeting, but to having open public dialogue.

859
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:20,066
[SPEAKER_00]: And Councilor Langel-Kern is correct.

860
01:06:20,527 --> 01:06:34,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years ago when they were doing the 9th Street project, because it was such a large particular project, at that point in time the council asked, and the developer agreed, they came before the council, committee of the whole, and then before the council, and we had a complete community meeting on that.

861
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:38,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Talked about what units were going to be affordable, which ones weren't going to be affordable.

862
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:48,126
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really needs to be understood, and I think Jeannie Martin, you said it right in the beginning, small-scale residential neighbors.

863
01:06:49,587 --> 01:06:52,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's one person that's impacted, that's one too many.

864
01:06:52,569 --> 01:06:59,593
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get the administration, and this President Mayer and her administration, making the comment on April 27th, as reported in the paper,

865
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:03,795
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is a great place to develop a new neighborhood and we're excited about it.

866
01:07:04,376 --> 01:07:09,680
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you be excited about it when the neighborhood itself wasn't even aware of it, didn't even have an opportunity to come and speak?

867
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe the Board of Appeals offered their opportunity for the public hearing and never got here.

868
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,761
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right when you're saying that your zoning should be reviewed.

869
01:07:18,241 --> 01:07:22,143
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be reviewed only because of the fact you don't want to keep going through things of this nature.

870
01:07:22,643 --> 01:07:24,424
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge development.

871
01:07:24,765 --> 01:07:25,765
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't singular.

872
01:07:25,805 --> 01:07:28,746
[SPEAKER_00]: This is coupled upon that for which is already there.

873
01:07:29,247 --> 01:07:33,509
[SPEAKER_00]: And that for which is already there will totally decimate that particular neighborhood.

874
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:35,870
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't even a three or a four-way road.

875
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,551
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a two-way road going in.

876
01:07:38,231 --> 01:07:41,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And just imagine all the stores that I just mentioned, Coles, Marshall, Wegmans.

877
01:07:43,149 --> 01:07:54,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Luminaires, the ice skating rink, 490 units, 7,000 square feet of office space, two apartment buildings, and seven other, you know, public, other commercial pieces of property at any one point in time, at any one day.

878
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:55,897
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think's gonna happen?

879
01:07:55,977 --> 01:08:04,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilman Marks is right when he talks about what the three new stores that opened up on Riverside Avenue, on any one given night or weekend, or especially on holidays or shopping.

880
01:08:04,803 --> 01:08:10,687
[SPEAKER_00]: You need not only smart development, you need a stop and look to see where this city is going.

881
01:08:11,427 --> 01:08:14,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Just development for the sake of development doesn't mean anything.

882
01:08:15,189 --> 01:08:34,198
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to have something that reaches the niche of every single person, whether it be senior citizen housing, whether it be more medical space, whether it be more space for your education, or whatever it might be, I don't know if it's going to take $250,000, but I know this, you would want a complete community interest.

883
01:08:34,818 --> 01:08:36,419
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't have to be like some of them.

884
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:42,673
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can beg, borrow, and steal like Somerville does in a smaller way in smaller sections of the city.

885
01:08:43,173 --> 01:08:45,094
[SPEAKER_00]: And let us not forget one important thing.

886
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:53,258
[SPEAKER_00]: At that meeting last Tuesday night, the neighborhood was most conciliatory by saying it wasn't that they were against the project.

887
01:08:53,698 --> 01:09:02,102
[SPEAKER_00]: It was way too large, didn't fit the neighborhood, and they were willing for something that would be much more reduced, that would be more compatible, and at least people could live with.

888
01:09:02,664 --> 01:09:22,440
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that they're looking for, something that they can live with, not something that's going to be thrown down their throat because they didn't have an opportunity for input, but more importantly, just because the city's going to garner approximately $2 million in taxes and approximately $1.6 million in linkage fees, this administration's looking at the money and they're cutting the beans as fast as they can.

889
01:09:23,281 --> 01:09:24,242
[SPEAKER_00]: And who's going to pay for it?

890
01:09:24,783 --> 01:09:26,125
[SPEAKER_00]: The neighborhood's going to pay for it.

891
01:09:26,785 --> 01:09:29,949
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who have been there, who have taken care of their property for years.

892
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,272
[SPEAKER_00]: All the side streets off of Riverside Avenue.

893
01:09:32,632 --> 01:09:39,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get off of Harvard Street now in the morning, add this to the congestion, and wait until Wellington Circle takes place and the 200 units over there.

894
01:09:40,001 --> 01:09:41,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everybody going to have a car?

895
01:09:41,202 --> 01:09:41,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.

896
01:09:42,183 --> 01:09:46,306
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if it's 10% more on that road, it's 10% more that it can't handle.

897
01:09:46,826 --> 01:09:49,028
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a police department that's in desperate need of help.

898
01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:50,649
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a school department.

899
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:52,831
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's getting maxed out because of these units.

900
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:54,772
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a fire department that's stretched.

901
01:09:54,792 --> 01:10:06,922
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know because the administration won't let them do a trial run into Wellington Circle to make sure we have a satellite fire station or a police station there for which the prior administration looked into but never did anything about it.

902
01:10:07,642 --> 01:10:19,888
[SPEAKER_00]: You have so many issues that are confronting you here, and to have the Board of Appeals just vote preliminarily to go forward and grant the easement, it's only going to satisfy those money-hungry developers coming in.

903
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:20,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Lumineers.

904
01:10:21,169 --> 01:10:25,711
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even in there a year, and they sold out for $66.6 million.

905
01:10:25,731 --> 01:10:26,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.

906
01:10:26,712 --> 01:10:28,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's to say this company won't do the same thing?

907
01:10:29,413 --> 01:10:37,337
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one thing that you can't sell out, and that's the integrity and the brains of the people that live in the neighborhood, because they know what's right

908
01:10:37,755 --> 01:10:48,979
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what's good for them, and they're paying their taxes, and I'm quite sure they don't want their taxes paid for something like this, which is going to absolutely make their neighborhood a deplorable place to live.

909
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:49,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

910
01:10:58,182 --> 01:10:58,562
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.

911
01:10:58,762 --> 01:11:00,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Please state your name and address for the record.

912
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,515
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

913
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:09,818
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 281 Park Street, which may not sound like in a butter, but I am a perfect cut through from the Fellsway to Riverside will lead right to this development.

914
01:11:10,878 --> 01:11:19,361
[SPEAKER_23]: I attended both meetings, the community development meeting and the zoning board meeting and Bill Brown, Park Avenue, New York represented equity one.

915
01:11:20,081 --> 01:11:25,263
[SPEAKER_23]: And the statement that is ringing in my ears from that meeting at the end, he turned around and looked right at us.

916
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:29,784
[SPEAKER_23]: All the citizens who'd sat there for an hour and a half presentation,

917
01:11:30,388 --> 01:11:32,129
[SPEAKER_23]: And then he got a rebuttal after that.

918
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:34,811
[SPEAKER_23]: And he said, it's coming.

919
01:11:35,651 --> 01:11:36,432
[SPEAKER_23]: Just deal with it.

920
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,974
[SPEAKER_23]: It may not be me, but it's coming.

921
01:11:39,414 --> 01:11:44,097
[SPEAKER_23]: You live in Medford, you're close to Boston, and people are going to build and build and build.

922
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:49,841
[SPEAKER_23]: My response to that was, no, Medford's going to say no.

923
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:53,703
[SPEAKER_23]: We're not going to let anybody come in and build anything they want.

924
01:11:54,524 --> 01:11:55,985
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to have some common sense.

925
01:11:57,175 --> 01:11:58,436
[SPEAKER_23]: Unfortunately, I was wrong.

926
01:11:59,156 --> 01:12:10,383
[SPEAKER_23]: But some of the things that he asked for and is granted, I did speak to Dennis McGonnell, I believe it is, and he said that this has passed.

927
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,065
[SPEAKER_23]: They just haven't had time to write it up.

928
01:12:12,765 --> 01:12:19,449
[SPEAKER_23]: He is adding over 1,000 toilets to Locust Street, and the city engineer asked him to expand the water line.

929
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:21,931
[SPEAKER_23]: He said, sure, I'll expand the water line.

930
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:22,711
[SPEAKER_23]: It'll cost me about $950,000.

931
01:12:22,851 --> 01:12:26,674
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like that deducted directly from my linkage fees.

932
01:12:27,729 --> 01:12:28,569
[SPEAKER_23]: The city said yes.

933
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:40,094
[SPEAKER_23]: He said, I'd also like to build a path to get to Freedom Way, probably because the people renting those units don't want to pay for the second parking space if they want, and he's going to charge rent for that.

934
01:12:40,614 --> 01:12:41,455
[SPEAKER_23]: They'll park at Hormel.

935
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:47,900
[SPEAKER_23]: He also wants to, the city is going to pay for that pathway because it's cheaper for him to build it, but he shouldn't have to pay for it.

936
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,080
[SPEAKER_23]: He also wants to build a path to Cummings.

937
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,701
[SPEAKER_23]: Someone from Spring Street said, is that so people can park on Spring Street?

938
01:12:55,442 --> 01:12:59,883
[SPEAKER_23]: He asked the city to pay for that because it's on city property, so he shouldn't have to pay for it.

939
01:13:00,663 --> 01:13:02,183
[SPEAKER_23]: He wants to give the city nothing.

940
01:13:02,584 --> 01:13:03,784
[SPEAKER_23]: He wants to take everything.

941
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:08,432
[SPEAKER_23]: He thinks nobody drives, but he's building 781 parking spaces.

942
01:13:08,912 --> 01:13:17,256
[SPEAKER_23]: He said that the community will not be coming onto this property because he's going to build 7,000 square feet of retail, but it's just going to be convenience.

943
01:13:17,876 --> 01:13:19,637
[SPEAKER_23]: Someone said, will that include a coffee shop?

944
01:13:19,677 --> 01:13:21,478
[SPEAKER_23]: He said, no, that won't include a coffee shop.

945
01:13:21,918 --> 01:13:26,322
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're talking convenience store dry cleaner, possibly, and an Eastern Bank.

946
01:13:26,342 --> 01:13:30,005
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're going to have three new driveways that are going to feed traffic onto Locust.

947
01:13:30,485 --> 01:13:33,087
[SPEAKER_23]: His traffic study only included Locust Street.

948
01:13:33,747 --> 01:13:34,648
[SPEAKER_23]: No other streets.

949
01:13:35,569 --> 01:13:37,030
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to impact Riverside.

950
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:37,891
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to impact 16.

951
01:13:38,131 --> 01:13:39,612
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to impact Park Street.

952
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:40,953
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to impact the square.

953
01:13:41,273 --> 01:13:42,835
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to impact everywhere.

954
01:13:43,435 --> 01:13:44,236
[SPEAKER_23]: It's too large.

955
01:13:45,526 --> 01:13:47,467
[SPEAKER_23]: More of the room was full of residents.

956
01:13:47,547 --> 01:13:48,507
[SPEAKER_23]: It was 85 degrees.

957
01:13:48,547 --> 01:13:51,969
[SPEAKER_23]: They turned the lights out on us so they could show their PowerPoint presentation.

958
01:13:52,389 --> 01:13:57,751
[SPEAKER_23]: We all sat and we waited and we waited and we all said, we're not opposed to development here.

959
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:03,554
[SPEAKER_23]: We were told in the transcript article, it said the mayor was expecting a stations landing type development.

960
01:14:03,854 --> 01:14:05,675
[SPEAKER_23]: This is not a stations landing type development.

961
01:14:06,415 --> 01:14:07,135
[SPEAKER_23]: It's too big.

962
01:14:07,556 --> 01:14:08,796
[SPEAKER_23]: It needs to be scaled back.

963
01:14:08,856 --> 01:14:10,597
[SPEAKER_23]: We need to consider the needs of the city.

964
01:14:10,957 --> 01:14:12,438
[SPEAKER_23]: The schools are already crowded.

965
01:14:13,485 --> 01:14:15,185
[SPEAKER_23]: And they're building a pathway to Freedom Way.

966
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:17,646
[SPEAKER_23]: You think that's not because they're going to have children in the schools?

967
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:18,046
[SPEAKER_23]: It is.

968
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:19,406
[SPEAKER_23]: We need to consider this.

969
01:14:20,027 --> 01:14:23,027
[SPEAKER_23]: Seriously, we need to stop this, or everyone else will keep coming.

970
01:14:24,368 --> 01:14:24,628
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

971
01:14:30,749 --> 01:14:32,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Citizen, please welcome.

972
01:14:32,329 --> 01:14:33,850
[SPEAKER_19]: State your name and address for the record.

973
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:35,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. President.

974
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Andrew Castanetti, Method, Massachusetts.

975
01:14:39,811 --> 01:14:41,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I was only going to bring up one point when Ms.

976
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:42,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Jean had spoken.

977
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:47,083
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a lengthy conversation and I come up with some more points.

978
01:14:47,503 --> 01:14:50,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure I'm not going to take up 10 minutes, whoever knowing me.

979
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:56,529
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, first off, I'm not for or against this development.

980
01:14:58,571 --> 01:15:01,653
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know enough about it.

981
01:15:01,673 --> 01:15:04,355
[SPEAKER_08]: 490 units of apartments for residential.

982
01:15:05,256 --> 01:15:09,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that's the number that's they have applied for.

983
01:15:09,099 --> 01:15:11,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like a big number to me.

984
01:15:12,952 --> 01:15:19,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Can someone give me an idea like a block away from this location behind the old metal glam mall?

985
01:15:20,536 --> 01:15:21,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, where miss is gonna go.

986
01:15:21,696 --> 01:15:22,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Marauder.

987
01:15:22,777 --> 01:15:37,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Marauder built some condominium complex kind of a large built I'd say does anyone can answer my question like how many units that is to give a comparison perspective a little bit someone please ballpark anyone 140

988
01:15:43,735 --> 01:15:47,356
[SPEAKER_16]: I can say that the building on the corner of Winthrop Street and High Street has 116 units in it.

989
01:15:49,017 --> 01:15:50,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know who Mr. Marauders is?

990
01:15:50,877 --> 01:15:58,279
[SPEAKER_16]: That was one of his buildings, and I think it's a... You think it's a... There's 116 units on the corner of Winthrop and High at that building.

991
01:15:58,299 --> 01:15:58,279
116?

992
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,520
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's just in one building.

993
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:02,121
[SPEAKER_16]: So, if it's a... The scope of that's six times the size.

994
01:16:02,221 --> 01:16:06,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Approximately, if it's a twin size, that's about 100 units, 120.

995
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:12,964
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is like three, four, five times, who knows, if we're accurate, number one.

996
01:16:14,101 --> 01:16:14,621
[SPEAKER_08]: That's huge.

997
01:16:15,582 --> 01:16:20,144
[SPEAKER_08]: However, Ms.

998
01:16:20,204 --> 01:16:43,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Jean brought up a good point, and I believe ex-councilor Pinter, who spoke a little while ago, alluded to this same comment that Jean had made at past council meetings, when he said we should, I believe his words were, something to the effect that we should have bought

999
01:16:43,602 --> 01:16:51,324
[SPEAKER_08]: that corner piece of real estate on Riverside Avenue, Locust Street, where the trucks have trouble making that turn.

1000
01:16:52,584 --> 01:16:58,286
[SPEAKER_08]: When we had the muscle, it was more affordable, and maybe we had some free cash back then also.

1001
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:10,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe the building is up for sale now, or it was recently sold, and maybe that's part of a development cost for a developer.

1002
01:17:14,104 --> 01:17:24,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I read in the local newspaper, method transcript, that someone was quoted, I believe, saying that this building was going to be mixed use.

1003
01:17:25,132 --> 01:17:26,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Mixed use is great.

1004
01:17:27,094 --> 01:17:29,876
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how the Roman Empire took care of business in Europe.

1005
01:17:30,256 --> 01:17:33,959
[SPEAKER_08]: When they would conquer a city, like whatever it was, they'll call it Paris.

1006
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:35,440
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to fight.

1007
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,141
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be your army.

1008
01:17:38,342 --> 01:17:40,924
[SPEAKER_08]: We build a round wall, plenty of land.

1009
01:17:41,577 --> 01:17:43,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're going to put the Coliseum in the center.

1010
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:44,178
[SPEAKER_08]: That's your entertainment.

1011
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,100
[SPEAKER_08]: No more blood and war.

1012
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:51,342
[SPEAKER_08]: We built City Hall, the Forum, the churches.

1013
01:17:53,524 --> 01:18:00,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, what they did was once they filled up that community in a round circle, they farmed the land outside.

1014
01:18:00,627 --> 01:18:06,931
[SPEAKER_08]: But then they would not develop from Boston to Somerville to South Medford to North Medford.

1015
01:18:07,311 --> 01:18:09,172
[SPEAKER_08]: They would say, let's go 50 miles away.

1016
01:18:09,312 --> 01:18:10,613
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll call it Worcester instead.

1017
01:18:11,085 --> 01:18:12,225
[SPEAKER_08]: and start a new development.

1018
01:18:12,886 --> 01:18:17,007
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was perfect mixed-use from 2,000 years ago or more.

1019
01:18:19,188 --> 01:18:20,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So mixed-use is great.

1020
01:18:21,429 --> 01:18:25,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember from the North End, they had businesses downstairs, upstairs.

1021
01:18:26,471 --> 01:18:28,051
[SPEAKER_08]: They would sleep in their apartments.

1022
01:18:29,152 --> 01:18:30,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't need a car or a bicycle.

1023
01:18:31,313 --> 01:18:32,673
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes great sense, mixed-use.

1024
01:18:33,533 --> 01:18:35,174
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if you're talking 500 units and

1025
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:44,592
[SPEAKER_08]: The average apartment is supposed to be 1,000 square feet, I believe, from my real estate days, I recollect.

1026
01:18:45,673 --> 01:18:49,195
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a half a million square feet of residential space.

1027
01:18:50,556 --> 01:18:58,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're talking 7,000 square feet on the ground floor for the mixed use end, not even a coffee shop.

1028
01:18:59,442 --> 01:19:00,223
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not even 1%.

1029
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:06,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, 10% of half a million is $50,000.

1030
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:07,922
[SPEAKER_08]: They're talking $7,000.

1031
01:19:09,604 --> 01:19:11,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I'm over here.

1032
01:19:15,929 --> 01:19:22,434
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this doesn't make sense.

1033
01:19:25,517 --> 01:19:33,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, my major concern as being a person that's trying to get owner-occupied real estate tax exemption for Medford,

1034
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:39,450
[SPEAKER_08]: because some of our Everett and Malden does it, but we don't do it for the owner occupies in this city.

1035
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,631
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd be concerned if this was a sweetheart deal.

1036
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:51,674
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I'd like to know what the residential real estate tax value is going to be before it's built.

1037
01:19:53,954 --> 01:20:02,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to know, I request to know what the tax rate is going to be.

1038
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:12,497
[SPEAKER_08]: for, and what it is called, if it's called residential, or condominiums, if they go condominium down the road.

1039
01:20:13,617 --> 01:20:14,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1040
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:31,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco has been trying for zoning, or looking at new zoning, and I think it makes good sense for the new development that's coming in.

1041
01:20:31,712 --> 01:20:32,392
[SPEAKER_08]: As a matter of fact, in 1960,

1042
01:20:33,884 --> 01:20:35,945
[SPEAKER_08]: As a child, I was living on Mystic Avenue.

1043
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:51,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of my ideas was the city should have taken all of Mystic Avenue only on the Route 93 side.

1044
01:20:54,755 --> 01:20:57,957
[SPEAKER_08]: And they could build a ring road

1045
01:21:00,476 --> 01:21:11,025
[SPEAKER_08]: to keep the people that would be living in the new buildings off Main Street, unless they really wanted to go to deeper squalor in those days.

1046
01:21:11,885 --> 01:21:16,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would have built all high rise office buildings, even 20 stories high.

1047
01:21:19,551 --> 01:21:30,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you worked there, you'd be at work now, as Marshall Sloan took the idea and put it on his billboard five years ago.

1048
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:37,323
[SPEAKER_08]: and helped to lower the real estate tax on Mar and Pa back in the 60s, mind you.

1049
01:21:38,184 --> 01:21:39,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's 2016.

1050
01:21:40,785 --> 01:21:44,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the people realize we're not a bedroom community.

1051
01:21:45,227 --> 01:21:46,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Route 93 is here.

1052
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:48,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Boston is five miles away.

1053
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:50,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

1054
01:21:58,474 --> 01:22:00,535
[SPEAKER_19]: The chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

1055
01:22:01,477 --> 01:22:02,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1056
01:22:02,478 --> 01:22:10,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd just like to make one more amendment to the resolution, and that is if we could obtain a copy of the traffic study.

1057
01:22:11,423 --> 01:22:20,848
[SPEAKER_19]: That the Medford City Council be given a copy of the traffic study that was presented to the Board of Appeals?

1058
01:22:21,068 --> 01:22:21,688
[SPEAKER_07]: You are correct.

1059
01:22:21,969 --> 01:22:22,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1060
01:22:24,727 --> 01:22:28,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Did this also appear before, did this go to the OCD board or whatever it is?

1061
01:22:28,269 --> 01:22:31,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It did go to the OCD board and then it went from there to the ZBA.

1062
01:22:31,731 --> 01:22:31,971
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1063
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:35,413
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll send that up to, we'll send that to both offices.

1064
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:36,773
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure one of them have it.

1065
01:22:37,074 --> 01:22:37,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1066
01:22:37,854 --> 01:22:38,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1067
01:22:40,676 --> 01:22:41,496
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome citizen.

1068
01:22:41,936 --> 01:22:43,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1069
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:45,898
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Pasquale Nuzzo.

1070
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:54,183
[SPEAKER_27]: I live at 35 Paris street and I can help out a little bit with the traffic study as to how they came up with no impact.

1071
01:22:54,844 --> 01:23:06,951
[SPEAKER_27]: What they did was they removed the traffic that was impacted by the grocery store and did not factor in the traffic from Wegmans so that they were able to have a zero impact.

1072
01:23:07,532 --> 01:23:17,478
[SPEAKER_27]: It was pretty much a wash, the same numbers for the grocery store would probably be about the impact for the Wegmans in their opinion, but they never added it into the final total.

1073
01:23:18,857 --> 01:23:19,738
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's one thing.

1074
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:40,714
[SPEAKER_27]: The other thing is, of the people that were there, there was one person that was for it, and I believe that it was for the low income, but I believe he was confused because the difference between low income and affordable is low income is based on the income of the area.

1075
01:23:41,314 --> 01:23:44,136
[SPEAKER_27]: Affordable housing is something completely different.

1076
01:23:45,137 --> 01:23:47,579
[SPEAKER_27]: From what I was told with the community development meetings,

1077
01:23:48,217 --> 01:23:55,101
[SPEAKER_27]: people brought up elderly housing, veterans, stuff like that, and they were vehemently denied.

1078
01:23:57,142 --> 01:23:59,503
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the base of what I've heard from them.

1079
01:24:00,764 --> 01:24:06,987
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, when we were sitting in there, they were talking about how they were going to get reimbursed for this or reimbursed for that.

1080
01:24:07,027 --> 01:24:08,228
[SPEAKER_27]: They were calling it easements.

1081
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:12,430
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm a general contractor, a much smaller scale.

1082
01:24:13,718 --> 01:24:15,599
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't get reimbursed for anything.

1083
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:20,162
[SPEAKER_27]: If I pull a water line, I factor it into my budget.

1084
01:24:20,402 --> 01:24:23,684
[SPEAKER_27]: If I have to upgrade something, I factor it into my budget.

1085
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:29,528
[SPEAKER_27]: In their plans, there was nothing for, like you were speaking, Councillor, about infrastructure.

1086
01:24:29,808 --> 01:24:32,410
[SPEAKER_27]: There was nothing for the power to drain from the building.

1087
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:35,232
[SPEAKER_27]: We have brownouts constantly in the city.

1088
01:24:36,131 --> 01:24:42,413
[SPEAKER_27]: Imagine 490 more air conditioners going on a 90-degree day.

1089
01:24:42,893 --> 01:24:43,993
[SPEAKER_27]: City's going to be dark.

1090
01:24:45,834 --> 01:24:47,795
[SPEAKER_27]: I won't even get started at the sewer system.

1091
01:24:47,855 --> 01:24:49,655
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a messy situation.

1092
01:24:50,675 --> 01:24:58,238
[SPEAKER_27]: But the water demand, they're upgrading the pipes because they think that it's a benefit to us.

1093
01:24:59,658 --> 01:25:03,079
[SPEAKER_27]: If they brought that building up, they would pump those lines up to over 80% of capacity.

1094
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:07,050
[SPEAKER_27]: which means they have to do that.

1095
01:25:08,251 --> 01:25:13,652
[SPEAKER_27]: They were talking in there about how they would have to build and conform to energy code.

1096
01:25:13,672 --> 01:25:17,153
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay, everybody that builds something now has to conform to this.

1097
01:25:17,453 --> 01:25:19,874
[SPEAKER_27]: This is no special thing that they're offering us.

1098
01:25:20,694 --> 01:25:24,235
[SPEAKER_27]: They're trying to say, oh, yay, I'm doing my job.

1099
01:25:24,575 --> 01:25:27,036
[SPEAKER_27]: Please help me out because I want to make more money.

1100
01:25:28,203 --> 01:25:32,587
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry if that sounds a little harsh, but I'm not a friendly public speaker.

1101
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:38,933
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, yes, people develop.

1102
01:25:39,113 --> 01:25:41,115
[SPEAKER_27]: People are going to build something there.

1103
01:25:41,855 --> 01:25:42,876
[SPEAKER_27]: Progress happens.

1104
01:25:44,357 --> 01:25:45,819
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't need anything that big.

1105
01:25:45,839 --> 01:25:47,440
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't want anything that big.

1106
01:25:48,461 --> 01:25:54,306
[SPEAKER_27]: And there are so many other ways that this project could have been done that would benefit everyone.

1107
01:25:55,828 --> 01:26:05,330
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't believe that they presented even a fully thought out plan as to what the impact of the area is to anyone involved.

1108
01:26:06,671 --> 01:26:12,072
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'll probably think of more when I step away from the mic, but I think that's about enough for today.

1109
01:26:12,552 --> 01:26:13,752
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much for your time.

1110
01:26:19,293 --> 01:26:19,694
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.

1111
01:26:20,094 --> 01:26:21,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1112
01:26:25,165 --> 01:26:26,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1113
01:26:26,325 --> 01:26:36,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Rob Capucci of 71 Evans Street, which is not a direct abutter, but very close proximity to this massive project that's coming.

1114
01:26:36,429 --> 01:26:48,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's not too much more to add to the conversation except to touch upon the infrastructure problems that the city already has.

1115
01:26:48,673 --> 01:26:54,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, here in this building, the high school, the police department,

1116
01:26:55,178 --> 01:26:57,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I was up here last week talking about Evans Street.

1117
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:14,827
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not against the development, but something this big, I definitely agree with Councillors Knight and Falco, that this is just something that seems to be too big, and it seems to be coming in with the impression I'm getting, with a lot of expediency.

1118
01:27:14,847 --> 01:27:20,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, actually being told, the citizens, by this developer, it's coming, deal with it.

1119
01:27:20,229 --> 01:27:21,290
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unprecedented.

1120
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank all the other speakers that spoke.

1121
01:27:24,993 --> 01:27:37,081
[SPEAKER_03]: When this traffic impact happens, you know, and it gets clogged on Felsway and Riverside Ave, these folks are going to be looking for, you know, quick shortcuts to get back to their house.

1122
01:27:37,342 --> 01:27:38,742
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be going down Evans Street.

1123
01:27:39,043 --> 01:27:40,103
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not fixed yet.

1124
01:27:40,664 --> 01:27:45,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councillor Knight for informing me that the bids are in to replace the water pipes.

1125
01:27:46,368 --> 01:27:53,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And once those bids seep through and one is decided on, they're going to come in and fix Evans Street, which is in the top five.

1126
01:27:54,409 --> 01:27:55,950
[SPEAKER_03]: of streets that needs to be fixed.

1127
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:59,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's probably a hundred or more streets that needs to be fixed.

1128
01:28:00,132 --> 01:28:08,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens when this added traffic is on the roads when Evans Street is shut down for, who knows, a month for fixing?

1129
01:28:08,897 --> 01:28:10,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And other streets are too.

1130
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:17,462
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to me that we don't want to discourage development.

1131
01:28:17,822 --> 01:28:20,164
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, we got to fix what we got first.

1132
01:28:20,624 --> 01:28:22,646
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't build on a faulty foundation.

1133
01:28:23,426 --> 01:28:27,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Our streets and roads, our water pipes, the parks are being looked at.

1134
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:36,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this location seems to me a good location to put a joint police and fire station instead of this massive project.

1135
01:28:38,538 --> 01:28:40,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems to me that there are other things to look at.

1136
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:51,597
[SPEAKER_03]: in this city first that need almost at a critical level of attention before we start entertaining massive, massive projects like this.

1137
01:28:51,758 --> 01:28:54,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a public safety issue too with all these cars going down the streets.

1138
01:28:55,380 --> 01:29:00,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in my neighborhood, there's at least 20 young kids that live on that street that are all over it.

1139
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:04,547
[SPEAKER_03]: If they can navigate through all the rocks on Evans Street,

1140
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:19,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for the jab on that one again, but still, I mean, in all of these neighborhoods with more cards on there, the safety risk goes up, and if it goes up even 1%, that's, I'm sorry, that's too much for my liking.

1141
01:29:21,384 --> 01:29:30,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't understand how this city council doesn't have jurisdiction over the appeal or whoever's approving this.

1142
01:29:31,467 --> 01:29:33,728
[SPEAKER_03]: It would seem that you must have something in the books

1143
01:29:34,465 --> 01:29:35,706
[SPEAKER_03]: put some kind of injunction.

1144
01:29:36,186 --> 01:29:37,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another thing.

1145
01:29:38,007 --> 01:29:47,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Why doesn't this body communicate with the DPW or with the police station or with other things to find out, you know, there's a lot of infrastructure problems in this city.

1146
01:29:47,974 --> 01:29:53,757
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, let's talk about this impact on the city and the taxpayers.

1147
01:29:53,938 --> 01:29:56,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we get together and maybe not

1148
01:29:56,517 --> 01:30:05,824
[SPEAKER_03]: approve this, especially in the manner with which they're keeping people in a dark room on a hot night and giving them three minutes to speak, and then they're being told.

1149
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:15,712
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the speakers that spoke earlier that called everybody to a public action, I can't emphasize and ditto her and echo her more.

1150
01:30:16,012 --> 01:30:23,538
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we need, not for just this issue, but I would love to see more people at this podium and in these chambers every week

1151
01:30:25,248 --> 01:30:46,279
[SPEAKER_03]: because when more voices are heard from all different parts of this city, more projects will have a fire lit under them, and more things will get done for the benefit of all of us, everybody on the city council, the administration, all the small businesses, and all the taxpayers, and all the residents, the kids in the schools, and everything else.

1152
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:49,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Politics is really not a spectator sport.

1153
01:30:50,241 --> 01:30:53,923
[SPEAKER_03]: But I hope you consider all the things everybody said tonight, and I thank you for your time.

1154
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:55,920
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, citizen.

1155
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:59,041
[SPEAKER_19]: The chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

1156
01:30:59,381 --> 01:30:59,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1157
01:30:59,961 --> 01:31:06,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, if I could amend my earlier motion about viewing the project, if we could also view the Wakeman's project also.

1158
01:31:07,202 --> 01:31:09,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Further amended by Councilor Caviello.

1159
01:31:09,342 --> 01:31:11,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Side by side, across from each other.

1160
01:31:12,383 --> 01:31:13,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing that we're doing it, we might as well look at both of them.

1161
01:31:14,883 --> 01:31:15,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1162
01:31:16,224 --> 01:31:16,804
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1163
01:31:19,404 --> 01:31:19,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.

1164
01:31:19,884 --> 01:31:21,525
[SPEAKER_19]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1165
01:31:22,045 --> 01:31:22,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

1166
01:31:22,725 --> 01:31:23,985
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Christopher Donovan.

1167
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:25,712
[SPEAKER_01]: and I live at 4 Lorraine Road.

1168
01:31:26,453 --> 01:31:27,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to speak loud.

1169
01:31:27,553 --> 01:31:36,576
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to speak clearly because I was in the back of the room and I have a difficult time hearing maybe because I'm getting old, but I think it may have to do with some of the infrastructure.

1170
01:31:37,517 --> 01:31:48,100
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I wanted to say thank you to all the counselors because I was lucky enough to be at the last two budget meetings, subcommittee meetings, and I saw the amount of time that you all put into the subcommittee meetings.

1171
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you for doing that because it takes a lot of time.

1172
01:31:51,271 --> 01:32:08,017
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have to say I was shocked and a little embarrassed to see department manager after department manager come up and say that where city is outdated, the infrastructure is old, and the communication between departments is almost non-existent.

1173
01:32:09,057 --> 01:32:17,640
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone here in the room knows me, and most of the councils know, I'm a big advocate for access, public, educational, and government.

1174
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:22,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's been issues with the public access side, and that's a story for another day.

1175
01:32:23,554 --> 01:32:28,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Educational is the high school, and that's the school committee, and that's a story for another day.

1176
01:32:29,358 --> 01:32:31,339
[SPEAKER_01]: But the government channel is your channel.

1177
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:35,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand there's jurisdiction, and I'm not sure where that falls under.

1178
01:32:36,103 --> 01:32:43,048
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think one of the main reasons, and I'll get to the Shaw's thing in a minute, that there is no one here is because there's no communication.

1179
01:32:43,768 --> 01:32:45,690
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw it in the departmental level.

1180
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:51,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it in the sound system and the video system that's been here since 1980.

1181
01:32:52,114 --> 01:32:53,716
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't get information.

1182
01:32:54,276 --> 01:32:59,020
[SPEAKER_01]: We're lucky enough to have some great people here who use Facebook and send the information out.

1183
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I learned about the city.

1184
01:33:02,582 --> 01:33:06,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucky we have Alex here from the transcript who sends information out.

1185
01:33:06,285 --> 01:33:09,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I wouldn't know a thing about the city.

1186
01:33:09,808 --> 01:33:12,350
[SPEAKER_01]: And I challenge all you counselors in a positive way

1187
01:33:12,851 --> 01:33:14,193
[SPEAKER_01]: to get your messages out there.

1188
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:16,215
[SPEAKER_01]: People are looking for these messages.

1189
01:33:16,655 --> 01:33:22,502
[SPEAKER_01]: People see what we talk about, or people, when they talk to you individually, see that you're with them.

1190
01:33:22,922 --> 01:33:25,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're up at the council, here's where I get confused.

1191
01:33:25,965 --> 01:33:31,552
[SPEAKER_01]: It may lead to chatter of you, which I'm not strong enough to understand what that's about.

1192
01:33:31,972 --> 01:33:34,435
[SPEAKER_01]: But if all of you are against this kind of project,

1193
01:33:35,385 --> 01:33:43,208
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who's for this project, and if we can't stop it between this body right here, maybe charter review is the key.

1194
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:56,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I don't understand what charter review is about, but I saw people make an effort to try and make something happen for charter review and change the city to get updated, to be compared to the cities around us.

1195
01:33:56,693 --> 01:33:59,674
[SPEAKER_01]: We ask our students to get graded all the time.

1196
01:34:00,509 --> 01:34:08,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's grade our city, not by ourselves, by about some other entities finding out if our city is up to spec.

1197
01:34:09,072 --> 01:34:10,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love Medford.

1198
01:34:10,453 --> 01:34:11,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Boston.

1199
01:34:11,593 --> 01:34:12,934
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the United States.

1200
01:34:12,994 --> 01:34:14,494
[SPEAKER_01]: We are so lucky.

1201
01:34:14,954 --> 01:34:18,216
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sitting back there five rows deep and I cannot hear.

1202
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:23,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a channel that I don't watch.

1203
01:34:24,598 --> 01:34:29,700
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask you, I have a very wise owl that told me, take small incremental steps.

1204
01:34:30,591 --> 01:34:32,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the incremental step I'm asking you to do.

1205
01:34:33,853 --> 01:34:38,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Put $1,000 into an audio system that people in the chamber can hear.

1206
01:34:39,976 --> 01:34:43,418
[SPEAKER_01]: As people get older, it's more difficult to hear, so it should be easier.

1207
01:34:43,438 --> 01:34:49,682
[SPEAKER_01]: A speaker, a speaker, pretty simple, but a line item budget for sound system to be improved.

1208
01:34:50,203 --> 01:34:53,765
[SPEAKER_01]: because I can't hear and I'm determined to listen to what's going on.

1209
01:34:54,426 --> 01:35:03,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other small step, that being step one, step two, replay this video, this council meeting, four times a day, every day.

1210
01:35:04,472 --> 01:35:06,033
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing else on the channel.

1211
01:35:06,653 --> 01:35:08,534
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing else on our government channel.

1212
01:35:08,774 --> 01:35:09,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it on.

1213
01:35:09,815 --> 01:35:14,037
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't watch it at six o'clock, seven, whatever time it's on live or rebroadcast.

1214
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:14,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.

1215
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:18,263
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a new information age where it's on demand.

1216
01:35:18,323 --> 01:35:24,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for whoever is posting these things online through some other external system.

1217
01:35:24,654 --> 01:35:29,622
[SPEAKER_01]: We have people that are being paid huge money in this town for communications offices.

1218
01:35:30,062 --> 01:35:36,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get to personalities or responsibilities, but it's not getting done, and that's why there's no one here.

1219
01:35:36,525 --> 01:35:37,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because they're indifferent.

1220
01:35:38,306 --> 01:35:45,410
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be family life, and that's why I thanked you early for spending that time to try and make Medford better, but get the message out.

1221
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:47,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the stuff on Facebook.

1222
01:35:47,371 --> 01:35:49,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it on our old, outdated website.

1223
01:35:49,992 --> 01:35:51,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Upgrade, change.

1224
01:35:51,193 --> 01:35:52,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the budget.

1225
01:35:52,093 --> 01:35:54,054
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you councils are fighting for it.

1226
01:35:54,474 --> 01:35:58,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Push harder, but find out who is stopping you from doing what you need to do.

1227
01:35:59,877 --> 01:36:00,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1228
01:36:07,438 --> 01:36:07,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.

1229
01:36:07,918 --> 01:36:09,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1230
01:36:10,019 --> 01:36:10,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1231
01:36:10,699 --> 01:36:13,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street in Medford.

1232
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:19,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's late and I've appreciated all that I've heard tonight and I'll be very short.

1233
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:29,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a contracting officer for the federal government for 22 years and we build things and I understand about building things and from what I've heard,

1234
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:31,902
[SPEAKER_04]: we are not ready to go forward with this project.

1235
01:36:32,622 --> 01:36:47,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I understand that it's not easy for you either, but I do hope that you will look into and try and get as much information as you can up front.

1236
01:36:47,533 --> 01:36:48,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1237
01:36:49,495 --> 01:36:50,416
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

1238
01:36:53,778 --> 01:36:54,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome.

1239
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:55,960
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1240
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:56,800
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

1241
01:36:57,161 --> 01:36:58,341
[SPEAKER_24]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1242
01:36:59,968 --> 01:37:02,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Medford Mass, 02155.

1243
01:37:05,769 --> 01:37:12,110
[SPEAKER_24]: Joyce Paul, Chris Donovan, and Mr. Cappucci all echoed things that I was going to say.

1244
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:12,590
[SPEAKER_24]: Amazing.

1245
01:37:12,990 --> 01:37:13,370
[SPEAKER_24]: Amazing.

1246
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:16,831
[SPEAKER_24]: So the community is in agreement.

1247
01:37:18,311 --> 01:37:24,152
[SPEAKER_24]: The late Patrick Fiorello came up to this council and complained about Eastern Bank going into the LOCA staff.

1248
01:37:25,372 --> 01:37:28,393
[SPEAKER_24]: And the council didn't know how to deal with my good friend, Pat.

1249
01:37:28,993 --> 01:37:34,276
[SPEAKER_24]: And I went over and tapped him on the shoulder and said, Pat, we have bigger fish to fry today, meaning TV3.

1250
01:37:34,897 --> 01:37:36,198
[SPEAKER_24]: And Pat walked away.

1251
01:37:36,258 --> 01:37:36,838
[SPEAKER_24]: God bless him.

1252
01:37:37,859 --> 01:37:39,180
[SPEAKER_24]: We did have bigger fish to fry.

1253
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:47,285
[SPEAKER_24]: Patrick, if you're watching us, we need you, because now this is the issue that you really want to sink your teeth into, Pat, with your TV camera.

1254
01:37:48,546 --> 01:37:51,828
[SPEAKER_24]: No public access and an issue so vitally important.

1255
01:37:53,249 --> 01:37:57,952
[SPEAKER_24]: Locust Street is, Mr. Capucci, a good place to put the fire station and the police station.

1256
01:37:58,623 --> 01:37:59,844
[SPEAKER_24]: It's innovative, it's novel.

1257
01:38:01,105 --> 01:38:02,286
[SPEAKER_24]: You have plenty of buildings there.

1258
01:38:02,686 --> 01:38:10,212
[SPEAKER_24]: When you look behind the new Wegman structure, there's a river, a stream, and there's so much trash in there.

1259
01:38:11,132 --> 01:38:13,354
[SPEAKER_24]: What are we, a third world country?

1260
01:38:13,434 --> 01:38:16,717
[SPEAKER_24]: And if they build this new development, will we have more trash behind it?

1261
01:38:17,917 --> 01:38:19,619
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to clean up what we have right now.

1262
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:24,382
[SPEAKER_24]: You got that road, I think it's Commercial Street, which goes by the

1263
01:38:25,967 --> 01:38:29,690
[SPEAKER_24]: the storage unit and the old DPW and stop and shop and harbor freight.

1264
01:38:30,451 --> 01:38:31,512
[SPEAKER_24]: And that road's a mess.

1265
01:38:31,852 --> 01:38:32,993
[SPEAKER_24]: And you've got the courthouse there.

1266
01:38:33,493 --> 01:38:35,615
[SPEAKER_24]: So you have all these cars coming through.

1267
01:38:36,516 --> 01:38:39,178
[SPEAKER_24]: And now you're going to add more cars, but the streets are a mess.

1268
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:42,421
[SPEAKER_24]: So now they want to build something while the infrastructure.

1269
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:47,405
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you all recall, Central Ave and Locust were two of the worst streets in Medford.

1270
01:38:47,865 --> 01:38:51,128
[SPEAKER_24]: How long did it take them to fix Locust, which was like a roller coaster ride?

1271
01:38:51,853 --> 01:38:55,174
[SPEAKER_24]: right at the bottom of the street where all the police cars usually are at that fix-it shop.

1272
01:38:55,374 --> 01:38:56,595
[SPEAKER_24]: It was like a roller coaster ride.

1273
01:38:56,935 --> 01:38:58,356
[SPEAKER_24]: Now the street still isn't even.

1274
01:38:59,536 --> 01:39:05,418
[SPEAKER_24]: And as you turn into Eastern Bank, there are potholes galore, which they fixed three or four years ago, and they're back.

1275
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:06,899
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, huge.

1276
01:39:06,919 --> 01:39:09,640
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if they've been fixed today, but last week they were not.

1277
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:15,642
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have to fix the infrastructure before we make great plans to build this new empire.

1278
01:39:16,302 --> 01:39:18,663
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to clean up behind Wegmans.

1279
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:20,124
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to clean up these streets.

1280
01:39:21,267 --> 01:39:24,969
[SPEAKER_24]: There are streets near Evans Street that are even worse than Evans Street, Bob.

1281
01:39:25,369 --> 01:39:26,930
[SPEAKER_24]: There are streets that are even worse.

1282
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:29,051
[SPEAKER_24]: Garfield Ave needs a new pave over.

1283
01:39:29,452 --> 01:39:36,095
[SPEAKER_24]: And I thought the council president said that National Grid was supposed to put all these streets back into pristine condition.

1284
01:39:36,896 --> 01:39:41,098
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm hearing from other cities and towns that it's the MO of National Grid that they do not.

1285
01:39:41,638 --> 01:39:45,781
[SPEAKER_24]: So they're not just taking Medford and making Medford an example.

1286
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:50,203
[SPEAKER_24]: I hear that National Grid allegedly is not doing business.

1287
01:39:50,696 --> 01:39:52,537
[SPEAKER_24]: the way they should in other cities and towns.

1288
01:39:52,597 --> 01:39:56,640
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe we should get together with the other cities and towns and say, hey, these roads need to be paved.

1289
01:39:56,921 --> 01:39:59,142
[SPEAKER_24]: They dug up our roads, let's pave them.

1290
01:39:59,803 --> 01:40:03,225
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's impressive seeing people here, and I agree with Mr. Donovan.

1291
01:40:03,345 --> 01:40:06,468
[SPEAKER_24]: If we had public access TV, there would be more people here.

1292
01:40:06,928 --> 01:40:07,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1293
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:19,317
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Councilor Langel-Kern, as amended by Councilors Caviello, Falco, Mox, Scarpelli, and Knight.

1294
01:40:23,077 --> 01:40:23,978
[SPEAKER_19]: One final amendment.

1295
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:25,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Just a quick one.

1296
01:40:26,398 --> 01:40:37,041
[SPEAKER_22]: Where this council is going to have an open public meeting next week through a resolution, I would ask that the administration do a reverse 911 call.

1297
01:40:41,282 --> 01:40:43,822
[SPEAKER_22]: This is an extremely important meeting, Mr. President.

1298
01:40:44,263 --> 01:40:50,244
[SPEAKER_22]: And if they want, I would hope they do the entire city, but if they want to do just particular areas,

1299
01:40:50,905 --> 01:40:56,368
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be fine with me, but a reverse 9-1-1 call needs to go out to notify residents.

1300
01:40:56,748 --> 01:40:59,450
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we get calls for returning your old prescriptions.

1301
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:06,273
[SPEAKER_19]: I get three or four phone calls a week, Mr. President, for things that don't concern me.

1302
01:41:06,353 --> 01:41:09,315
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I'm still speaking.

1303
01:41:10,536 --> 01:41:14,658
[SPEAKER_22]: I get three or four calls a week on things that really don't concern me.

1304
01:41:15,458 --> 01:41:16,959
[SPEAKER_22]: And I hear the same thing for residents.

1305
01:41:17,369 --> 01:41:22,173
[SPEAKER_22]: And the things that do concern me, I think we should be receiving phone calls about.

1306
01:41:22,753 --> 01:41:24,995
[SPEAKER_22]: And these are the important quality of life issues.

1307
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:30,239
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would hope that a call go out immediately notifying people next Tuesday at 7 p.m.

1308
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:38,486
[SPEAKER_22]: There's going to be a public meeting, not a hearing, a public meeting on the Locust Street project, the 490 units.

1309
01:41:38,846 --> 01:41:45,912
[SPEAKER_22]: And residents are more than happy to come up and voice their opinion on the project itself, Mr. President.

1310
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:47,714
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Longo.

1311
01:41:48,074 --> 01:41:49,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Briefly, thank you, President De La Rosa.

1312
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:54,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Just one more amendment, because I don't think it was put forth.

1313
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:57,296
[SPEAKER_10]: We are seven people.

1314
01:41:57,336 --> 01:41:58,297
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the city council.

1315
01:41:58,337 --> 01:42:00,537
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously, we don't have as much power as the mayor.

1316
01:42:00,597 --> 01:42:10,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So I respectfully request that she reach out to the Board of Appeals and let the Board of Appeals know how the council voted and that she strongly feels the same way.

1317
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,280
[SPEAKER_10]: This issue is going to

1318
01:42:15,415 --> 01:42:20,499
[SPEAKER_10]: That is something that is needed to stall this decision, whether or not she opposes it.

1319
01:42:20,899 --> 01:42:27,144
[SPEAKER_10]: There are grave concerns here, and we've seen it tonight, and we didn't even actually put it on the agenda.

1320
01:42:27,264 --> 01:42:30,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week it will be on the agenda, and we're going to have more people speak out.

1321
01:42:30,967 --> 01:42:39,974
[SPEAKER_10]: This is of grave concern, and as I've heard the rumors that it is being approved, I've also heard rumors that there's a possibility of lawsuits by the neighbors.

1322
01:42:40,394 --> 01:42:43,857
[SPEAKER_10]: We all know what happened several years back with the VNA.

1323
01:42:45,855 --> 01:42:47,055
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want it to happen again.

1324
01:42:47,256 --> 01:42:50,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Please stall that decision from being rendered and do the right thing.

1325
01:42:51,897 --> 01:42:58,859
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have an open public meeting, but the city should have one in a bigger form than this, just like we did years ago with the 9th Street development.

1326
01:42:59,299 --> 01:42:59,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1327
01:43:00,199 --> 01:43:00,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1328
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:08,042
[SPEAKER_19]: On the main motion as amended, all those in favor?

1329
01:43:08,102 --> 01:43:08,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call.

1330
01:43:09,011 --> 01:43:10,432
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1331
01:43:10,472 --> 01:43:12,392
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

1332
01:43:12,572 --> 01:43:14,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1333
01:43:14,173 --> 01:43:16,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1334
01:43:16,194 --> 01:43:16,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1335
01:43:17,074 --> 01:43:18,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1336
01:43:18,775 --> 01:43:19,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1337
01:43:20,896 --> 01:43:21,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1338
01:43:21,716 --> 01:43:26,118
[SPEAKER_19]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion carries.

1339
01:43:31,724 --> 01:43:37,367
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Councillor Marks to refer to the regular order of business, seconded by Councillor Knight.

1340
01:43:37,407 --> 01:43:38,128
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favour?

1341
01:43:38,148 --> 01:43:38,908
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

1342
01:43:39,429 --> 01:43:41,530
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion is granted.

1343
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:52,516
[SPEAKER_19]: 16-535, offered by Councillor Marks, be it resolved that the municipal and school budgets for fiscal year 17 include a line item under the operational budget for water and sewer expenses.

1344
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,036
[SPEAKER_19]: Councillor?

1345
01:43:54,797 --> 01:43:55,818
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1346
01:43:56,418 --> 01:43:59,160
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a great issue to talk about,

1347
01:44:00,004 --> 01:44:07,487
[SPEAKER_22]: during budget deliberations, which this council for the past two nights have met with department heads.

1348
01:44:08,367 --> 01:44:19,972
[SPEAKER_22]: A little known fact that people may not be aware of that the municipal side of the city and the school side do not pay a water and sewer bill.

1349
01:44:21,112 --> 01:44:29,095
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, in my opinion, water and sewer, like any other utility, should be part of the operating budget.

1350
01:44:31,359 --> 01:44:32,819
[SPEAKER_22]: in the city.

1351
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:47,665
[SPEAKER_22]: And the annual non-payment right now of water and sewer by both the municipal and the school department results in an annual deficit of roughly $400,000 a year.

1352
01:44:48,726 --> 01:44:52,127
[SPEAKER_22]: And the city's quick to say, not a problem.

1353
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:54,968
[SPEAKER_22]: All we do is pass this on to the ratepayers.

1354
01:44:56,069 --> 01:44:56,869
[SPEAKER_22]: They'll pay for it.

1355
01:44:57,429 --> 01:44:58,550
[SPEAKER_22]: So depending on

1356
01:44:59,358 --> 01:45:11,825
[SPEAKER_22]: your water consumption, it adds between $30 to $90 for each of the 14,000 meters in this community onto your water and sewer rate a year.

1357
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:18,068
[SPEAKER_22]: That may not seem like a big cost, but that cost should be included within the confines of the budget.

1358
01:45:18,428 --> 01:45:21,290
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no reason why that should be outside of the budget.

1359
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:27,833
[SPEAKER_22]: It's part of electricity bill, a gas bill, water and sewer bill, like every homeowner pays.

1360
01:45:28,267 --> 01:45:30,448
[SPEAKER_22]: It's part of your operating expenses.

1361
01:45:31,389 --> 01:45:49,861
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would ask, Mr. President, that the city and its budget deliberations include a line item in the operating side of the school and on the city side that would include operating expense for water and sewer.

1362
01:45:50,862 --> 01:45:57,486
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, when we talk about accountability, what better when we talk about accountability that the city knows

1363
01:45:57,959 --> 01:46:02,242
[SPEAKER_22]: exactly what they're using for water and sewer, and exactly what they should be paying.

1364
01:46:02,862 --> 01:46:04,223
[SPEAKER_22]: We talk about conservation.

1365
01:46:04,604 --> 01:46:13,310
[SPEAKER_22]: How can the city say, let's conserve Method residents, where they don't really care what their bill is, because they're just passing it on to you, the rate payer.

1366
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:17,372
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, you could take a look at conservation.

1367
01:46:18,073 --> 01:46:20,955
[SPEAKER_22]: Any day you go out in front of City Hall, it's like Niagara Falls out there.

1368
01:46:22,016 --> 01:46:24,537
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, with the water sprinklers going on all day.

1369
01:46:26,008 --> 01:46:29,969
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that's one of the reasons why we need to take control of this particular issue.

1370
01:46:31,469 --> 01:46:40,131
[SPEAKER_22]: The MWRA has a giant meter, believe it or not, and that's how they charge the city for water that's coming into the community.

1371
01:46:40,892 --> 01:46:48,994
[SPEAKER_22]: And roughly 19 to 20% of the water coming into our community is what they refer to as unaccounted for.

1372
01:46:50,474 --> 01:46:52,475
[SPEAKER_22]: And you'd say to yourself, well, how is it unaccounted for?

1373
01:46:52,515 --> 01:46:54,395
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a giant meter that's accounting for it.

1374
01:46:54,765 --> 01:46:57,406
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we have separate meters here at City Hall.

1375
01:46:57,727 --> 01:46:58,987
[SPEAKER_22]: We have them at the school buildings.

1376
01:46:59,247 --> 01:47:00,828
[SPEAKER_22]: We have separate meters in everyone's home.

1377
01:47:01,228 --> 01:47:02,829
[SPEAKER_22]: How do we have unaccounted for water?

1378
01:47:03,289 --> 01:47:06,431
[SPEAKER_22]: And there are different ways that we do have unaccounted for water.

1379
01:47:06,831 --> 01:47:10,033
[SPEAKER_22]: One of them is leaks through the distribution system.

1380
01:47:10,653 --> 01:47:16,316
[SPEAKER_22]: And the city tries to address those particular leaks within the water grid that we have.

1381
01:47:17,116 --> 01:47:24,220
[SPEAKER_22]: And the other is there are still some entities in the community on the municipal side and on the school side

1382
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,022
[SPEAKER_22]: that aren't needed currently right now.

1383
01:47:28,042 --> 01:47:33,967
[SPEAKER_22]: And the lion's share of it is the municipal school side and the municipal and the school side.

1384
01:47:34,547 --> 01:47:38,630
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's what I'm trying to address through this resolution tonight.

1385
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:46,896
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we have to be mindful that, you know, the ratepayers are paying enough on their water and sewer now.

1386
01:47:47,356 --> 01:47:53,721
[SPEAKER_22]: And just to add on the city and school side, like it's not their responsibility,

1387
01:47:54,215 --> 01:47:55,576
[SPEAKER_22]: To me, I have a problem with that.

1388
01:47:56,296 --> 01:48:06,541
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't think anyone should be paying over and above, other than the operating costs, to run a water and sewer program, which is included in the rate payers' bills.

1389
01:48:07,201 --> 01:48:09,362
[SPEAKER_22]: They shouldn't be paying for this unaccounted for water.

1390
01:48:09,662 --> 01:48:10,443
[SPEAKER_22]: Because guess what?

1391
01:48:10,843 --> 01:48:11,843
[SPEAKER_22]: We can account for it.

1392
01:48:12,204 --> 01:48:14,985
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have a sheet in front of me, for instance,

1393
01:48:16,148 --> 01:48:18,889
[SPEAKER_22]: As I mentioned, it was about $400,000 in unaccounted for water.

1394
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:21,889
[SPEAKER_22]: The schools are about $190,457 broken by school by school.

1395
01:48:21,989 --> 01:48:23,390
[SPEAKER_22]: And municipal buildings are about $43,566.

1396
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:25,190
[SPEAKER_22]: Irrigation, so these are the different parks throughout the community, $152,000.

1397
01:48:44,403 --> 01:48:46,044
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we have the fire stations.

1398
01:48:47,365 --> 01:48:47,705
[SPEAKER_22]: That is $6,290.

1399
01:48:47,805 --> 01:48:56,350
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you add these all up, and the water commissioner voted to, we have a tiered system now, three tiers.

1400
01:48:56,650 --> 01:49:00,412
[SPEAKER_22]: They voted to do tier two, which is the middle of the pricing system.

1401
01:49:00,973 --> 01:49:03,154
[SPEAKER_22]: And that comes out to about $393,000, almost $400,000.

1402
01:49:03,194 --> 01:49:04,955
[SPEAKER_22]: So that would be my resolution and motion tonight, Mr. President.

1403
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:22,318
[SPEAKER_22]: to have the city administration include a line item for water and sewer, and the operating expense on the municipal and on the school side in the interest of fairness, the interest of accountability, and the interest of water conservation in our community.

1404
01:49:27,341 --> 01:49:29,122
[SPEAKER_16]: On that motion, Councilor Knight.

1405
01:49:30,322 --> 01:49:34,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I think we discussed this matter just a few weeks ago, and I think this was something that we were all on the same page

1406
01:49:35,496 --> 01:49:37,997
[SPEAKER_16]: We're sitting here, we're asking our school department to conserve water.

1407
01:49:38,097 --> 01:49:43,358
[SPEAKER_16]: We're establishing a tiered system to encourage our residents to conserve water.

1408
01:49:43,958 --> 01:49:45,399
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're not monitoring our own intake.

1409
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:47,940
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think what's good for the goose should be good for the gander.

1410
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:51,761
[SPEAKER_16]: And I certainly support Councilor Moxley's resolution wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

1411
01:49:53,581 --> 01:49:55,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes Vice President Alago-Kern.

1412
01:49:56,102 --> 01:49:56,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1413
01:49:57,076 --> 01:49:57,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

1414
01:49:58,037 --> 01:50:02,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I also concur with my colleagues, Councillor Moxon and Councillor Knight.

1415
01:50:02,421 --> 01:50:06,905
[SPEAKER_10]: I, too, agree that $400,000 should be a separate line item.

1416
01:50:07,425 --> 01:50:12,529
[SPEAKER_10]: We, as the city, pay for all other utilities except for water and sewer.

1417
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:20,116
[SPEAKER_10]: It brings no accountability for the use and misuse of this utility.

1418
01:50:20,136 --> 01:50:24,019
[SPEAKER_10]: $400,000 is being put onto the ratepayers' backs rather than

1419
01:50:25,938 --> 01:50:29,941
[SPEAKER_10]: being put into the city budget, which I believe is where it should be as well.

1420
01:50:30,322 --> 01:50:32,223
[SPEAKER_10]: So I 100% agree with this.

1421
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:48,557
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to also amend while we're on the water and sewer issues, if we can, get an update from the mayor's office with regards to the leak detection program that Louise Miller and the Water and Sewer Commission put into the budget, I believe, probably six months ago.

1422
01:50:48,577 --> 01:50:51,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I did hear that that was taken out of the budget.

1423
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:53,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we can get an explanation as to why.

1424
01:50:53,965 --> 01:51:00,266
[SPEAKER_10]: This council advocated for a leak detection system, I think, many, many times.

1425
01:51:00,326 --> 01:51:02,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And we finally got the resolution we wanted.

1426
01:51:02,987 --> 01:51:05,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Water and Sewer Commission is in full support of this.

1427
01:51:05,188 --> 01:51:06,308
[SPEAKER_10]: They voted to approve it.

1428
01:51:06,808 --> 01:51:09,308
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was recently taken out of the budget.

1429
01:51:09,369 --> 01:51:15,690
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we could get a report back with regards to why the leak detection system was taken out of the budget, if that is the case.

1430
01:51:17,862 --> 01:51:24,163
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, and as amended by Vice President Longo Kern.

1431
01:51:24,583 --> 01:51:25,344
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

1432
01:51:25,464 --> 01:51:26,144
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks?

1433
01:51:27,284 --> 01:51:33,945
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to give a special thanks to who provided some information to me, Mr. Dominic Camara, was very helpful.

1434
01:51:34,326 --> 01:51:45,448
[SPEAKER_22]: And just to touch upon what Councilor Longo mentioned, that was also a bullet point mentioning that the Water and Sewer Commission voted to approve funding for citywide leak detection.

1435
01:51:46,504 --> 01:51:57,590
[SPEAKER_22]: So I guess that is going to take place through maybe the MWRA leak detection program or through the assessments here in the city.

1436
01:51:57,610 --> 01:52:04,274
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure how it's going to take place.

1437
01:52:04,474 --> 01:52:11,658
[SPEAKER_10]: As of today, I did hear from a very similar source that it was taken out of the budget completely.

1438
01:52:11,758 --> 01:52:15,200
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to make sure either it's put in some sort of

1439
01:52:16,468 --> 01:52:23,571
[SPEAKER_10]: some other way or, you know, want to get a report back from the mayor's office of if we're not going to do it at all, because I think that's important to discuss.

1440
01:52:23,591 --> 01:52:24,932
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe we'll ask that during the budget to see.

1441
01:52:24,952 --> 01:52:28,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'll ask that during the budget too, but if we could get a report from the mayor's office on what the plan is.

1442
01:52:28,694 --> 01:52:30,775
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

1443
01:52:30,795 --> 01:52:31,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call.

1444
01:52:31,675 --> 01:52:32,095
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call.

1445
01:52:32,355 --> 01:52:33,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

1446
01:53:01,823 --> 01:53:03,804
[SPEAKER_19]: 16-534.

1447
01:53:07,785 --> 01:53:22,209
[SPEAKER_19]: President De La Russo and members of the Medford City Council, from Mayor Stephanie Burke, re-authorization to engage in community electricity aggregation under General Laws, Chapter 164, Paragraph 134A.

1448
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:31,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Dear President De La Russo and members of the Medford City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body authorize the city of Medford to engage

1449
01:53:31,583 --> 01:53:39,226
[SPEAKER_19]: in community electricity aggregation pursuant to the provisions of General Laws, Chapter 164, Paragraph 134A.

1450
01:53:39,266 --> 01:53:43,728
[SPEAKER_19]: The appropriate language for this authorization is as follows.

1451
01:53:44,588 --> 01:54:00,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it ordered that the Mayor and the City Council authorize the City of Medford Office of Energy and Environment to research, develop, and participate in a contract or contracts to aggregate the electricity load of the residents and businesses in the city and for other related services independently

1452
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:09,423
[SPEAKER_19]: are in joint action with other municipalities and authorize the Mayor to execute all documents necessary to accomplish the same.

1453
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:15,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Alicia Hunt will be in attendance at the City Council meeting to describe the elements of this program.

1454
01:54:15,966 --> 01:54:21,328
[SPEAKER_19]: Sincerely yours, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor, signature on file.

1455
01:54:22,249 --> 01:54:30,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Before us at the podium is the Director of the Office of Energy and Environment, Alicia Hunt, and she'll explain this to us.

1456
01:54:30,859 --> 01:54:32,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1457
01:54:33,081 --> 01:54:33,581
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening.

1458
01:54:34,082 --> 01:54:36,924
[SPEAKER_29]: Alicia Hunt, 41 Wasson Street here in Medford.

1459
01:54:37,444 --> 01:54:48,473
[SPEAKER_29]: With me this evening is Patrick Roche of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, our regional planning agency, because they have a lot of experience with this and they've been offering us help and guidance in this area.

1460
01:54:50,134 --> 01:54:53,657
[SPEAKER_29]: There may be regional questions that he would know the answer to that I didn't.

1461
01:54:54,017 --> 01:54:59,542
[SPEAKER_29]: We did discuss this at a committee of the whole, and so Patrick did research a number of the questions that were asked for.

1462
01:54:59,985 --> 01:55:16,257
[SPEAKER_29]: but for the benefit of everybody who did not have the benefit of the Committee of the Whole, I don't usually prepare a written statement, but because it's long and it's late, I do have it sort of spelled out that I'm gonna primarily read to make sure that I don't miss any of the key points.

1463
01:55:18,699 --> 01:55:28,447
[SPEAKER_29]: So municipal aggregation, on every electric bill, there's a separate charge for the electricity supplied and charges for the distribution of the electricity.

1464
01:55:29,705 --> 01:55:35,710
[SPEAKER_29]: Massachusetts electricity has been deregulated in an effort to provide competition in the electricity market.

1465
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:36,910
[SPEAKER_29]: This is not new.

1466
01:55:37,391 --> 01:55:44,176
[SPEAKER_29]: However, under Massachusetts law, electricity utilities only profit from the distribution charges.

1467
01:55:44,576 --> 01:55:47,819
[SPEAKER_29]: The supply charges are just a straight pass-through to them.

1468
01:55:48,439 --> 01:55:56,245
[SPEAKER_29]: Therefore, they don't benefit from supply, and our utility is perfectly happy that we get our electricity from whoever we want to.

1469
01:55:57,150 --> 01:56:02,712
[SPEAKER_29]: Large consumers of electricity take advantage of this and buy their electricity on the open market.

1470
01:56:03,073 --> 01:56:17,319
[SPEAKER_29]: Electricity is a commodity traded in this area, and the price fluctuates constantly and is dependent on many things, including how much you buy, the length of time of your contract, and the exact timing of when you make your purchase.

1471
01:56:18,879 --> 01:56:23,882
[SPEAKER_29]: As with any commodity, it goes up and down day to day, in fact, hour to hour.

1472
01:56:25,173 --> 01:56:27,174
[SPEAKER_29]: You can buy it on a spot market, in fact.

1473
01:56:27,754 --> 01:56:37,538
[SPEAKER_29]: The city has been buying electricity through a secondary supplier at a good time of year for us, aggregating our use and getting good pricing.

1474
01:56:38,359 --> 01:56:46,542
[SPEAKER_29]: And we usually sign contracts between one and three years, depending on what's being offered to us at the time, what's the best rate.

1475
01:56:47,283 --> 01:56:55,730
[SPEAKER_29]: So right now, National Grid purchases and supplies electricity to all of our residences that have not signed up with another supplier.

1476
01:56:56,250 --> 01:57:00,393
[SPEAKER_29]: However, the state regulates when National Grid can buy the electricity.

1477
01:57:01,174 --> 01:57:04,597
[SPEAKER_29]: They're limited to one specific day in October and one in April.

1478
01:57:05,317 --> 01:57:11,102
[SPEAKER_29]: As such, the price changes for our consumers twice a year, April and October.

1479
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:30,057
[SPEAKER_29]: While they buy a large supply, so you would think they could get a good rate, as anybody knows, when you have to make a purchase on a particular day, you're not getting the best rate you could if you could time it, your purchase, to when there's a sale or a large supply so you can work with the market.

1480
01:57:31,738 --> 01:57:35,459
[SPEAKER_29]: So they are regulated by the state and do not get good

1481
01:57:35,889 --> 01:57:38,371
[SPEAKER_29]: the best prices possible for our residents.

1482
01:57:39,031 --> 01:57:51,180
[SPEAKER_29]: So municipal aggregation allows the city of Medford to contract with a consultant that would help us aggregate the volume of our residents and businesses who have not already done their own contract on their behalf.

1483
01:57:51,561 --> 01:58:00,167
[SPEAKER_29]: For example, Tufts University has already done this same process, and so they would not be part of this because they already contract for their supply.

1484
01:58:01,588 --> 01:58:02,749
[SPEAKER_29]: They would be able to do that.

1485
01:58:02,909 --> 01:58:04,450
[SPEAKER_29]: They would be able to time the market

1486
01:58:04,787 --> 01:58:07,689
[SPEAKER_29]: to make a strategic purchase on behalf of our residents.

1487
01:58:08,129 --> 01:58:13,433
[SPEAKER_29]: So they'd both be aggregated and the purchase would be timed to be best for them.

1488
01:58:14,313 --> 01:58:19,157
[SPEAKER_29]: And they would be able to look, we would look at the timing of that as well.

1489
01:58:19,737 --> 01:58:21,899
[SPEAKER_29]: And so how long the contract is.

1490
01:58:22,899 --> 01:58:25,441
[SPEAKER_29]: Sometimes you get a better rate if you commit to two years.

1491
01:58:25,681 --> 01:58:28,563
[SPEAKER_29]: Sometimes you get a better rate if you commit to one year.

1492
01:58:29,003 --> 01:58:30,384
[SPEAKER_29]: It's very market dependent.

1493
01:58:31,045 --> 01:58:34,087
[SPEAKER_29]: So this would provide for our residents two major benefits.

1494
01:58:34,625 --> 01:58:42,969
[SPEAKER_29]: a competitive price compared to what they're getting from National Grid, and also price stability, because at least for a full year they would know what the price is.

1495
01:58:43,769 --> 01:58:48,611
[SPEAKER_29]: So while no one can guarantee price savings, that is the goal of this program.

1496
01:58:49,532 --> 01:58:51,533
[SPEAKER_29]: And we could guarantee price stability.

1497
01:58:51,593 --> 01:58:53,974
[SPEAKER_29]: We could tell them, here's when your price will change again.

1498
01:58:53,994 --> 01:59:02,538
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is especially helpful for those who are on fixed incomes to know what the rate is going to be.

1499
01:59:02,975 --> 01:59:04,997
[SPEAKER_29]: for a longer period of time than six months.

1500
01:59:05,757 --> 01:59:08,720
[SPEAKER_29]: So you may have already heard from some Medford residents about this.

1501
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:11,722
[SPEAKER_29]: This is because Melrose did this last year.

1502
01:59:11,902 --> 01:59:18,107
[SPEAKER_29]: So this past January, Melrose residents started participating in a municipal aggregation.

1503
01:59:18,948 --> 01:59:22,591
[SPEAKER_29]: Melrose is one of 70 municipalities that are doing this in the state.

1504
01:59:23,772 --> 01:59:25,633
[SPEAKER_29]: There are a number of others who are in the process.

1505
01:59:25,974 --> 01:59:27,815
[SPEAKER_29]: I've been talking with Cambridge.

1506
01:59:29,236 --> 01:59:30,057
[SPEAKER_29]: They do their own thing.

1507
01:59:30,939 --> 01:59:48,438
[SPEAKER_29]: But Somerville, which is another of our neighbors, sorry, Cambridge is complicated in this area right this minute, but they do have every intention of contracting on behalf of their residents, and Somerville is actually going through this process right now, as is Winchester, Woburn, and Arlington, which are some of our neighbors.

1508
01:59:48,478 --> 01:59:51,602
[SPEAKER_29]: They're in this stage of the process, actually.

1509
01:59:53,940 --> 02:00:01,301
[SPEAKER_29]: So the municipal aggregation program would allow residents and businesses to leave the program at any time with no penalty cost.

1510
02:00:01,622 --> 02:00:10,283
[SPEAKER_29]: So if we contracted for a rate and a resident said, I want to go back to National Grid, they could just call up National Grid, call up the consultant and say, I'm out.

1511
02:00:10,723 --> 02:00:15,604
[SPEAKER_29]: And they would be out and there would be no penalty to them to be getting to leave the aggregation.

1512
02:00:16,604 --> 02:00:19,145
[SPEAKER_29]: This would provide residents with an additional choice.

1513
02:00:19,722 --> 02:00:24,024
[SPEAKER_29]: in addition to being able to pay the national, like instead of National Grid, this would be a choice for them.

1514
02:00:25,285 --> 02:00:27,426
[SPEAKER_29]: However, so let me just keep going.

1515
02:00:28,067 --> 02:00:29,167
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't want to confuse things.

1516
02:00:29,328 --> 02:00:40,994
[SPEAKER_29]: As part of the program, a consultant would create an outreach plan specifically for Medford that would educate our residents on electricity purchases and give them the option to opt out of this program if they want to.

1517
02:00:42,195 --> 02:00:47,078
[SPEAKER_29]: That same consultant would take us out to bid for an electricity supply and oversee the program.

1518
02:00:51,481 --> 02:01:00,327
[SPEAKER_29]: I also like that because it gives us an opportunity to educate people about electricity, and I would want to educate them about conservation as well.

1519
02:01:01,107 --> 02:01:09,032
[SPEAKER_29]: In addition, we can use the municipal aggregation to lower the carbon footprint and greenhouse gases of the Medford community as a whole.

1520
02:01:09,832 --> 02:01:17,157
[SPEAKER_29]: Specifically, this program would allow us to increase the amount of local clean energy in each resident's electricity supply.

1521
02:01:17,742 --> 02:01:21,604
[SPEAKER_29]: a small amount above the minimum that's currently required by state law.

1522
02:01:22,305 --> 02:01:37,713
[SPEAKER_29]: That small amount allows us to maintain the price savings of the program, but it adds up to a very large purchase on behalf of all the residents, and such a large purchase is likely to help add new local clean energy to our electricity grid over time.

1523
02:01:39,555 --> 02:01:53,178
[SPEAKER_29]: The outreach program would allow residents to opt out of the program completely, opt out of just the extra renewable energy portion of the program, or actually to opt in to 100% renewable energy if they wanted to.

1524
02:01:54,639 --> 02:02:00,960
[SPEAKER_29]: If approved tonight, we would have permission to begin pursuing municipal aggregation on behalf of our residents.

1525
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:08,302
[SPEAKER_29]: To start, we would contract with a consultant who would create an aggregation plan, which includes the local outreach plan.

1526
02:02:08,897 --> 02:02:14,419
[SPEAKER_29]: There would be a public comment period and the City Council would have to approve that public outreach plan.

1527
02:02:14,899 --> 02:02:21,722
[SPEAKER_29]: We would then send that to the Department of Public Utilities for approval and the Department of Energy Resources for their review.

1528
02:02:22,462 --> 02:02:28,204
[SPEAKER_29]: Once all the approvals are received, we actually anticipate that to take two to three months.

1529
02:02:28,704 --> 02:02:30,025
[SPEAKER_29]: The consultant would then

1530
02:02:30,594 --> 02:02:33,255
[SPEAKER_29]: time the market to get us the best possible price.

1531
02:02:33,375 --> 02:02:37,976
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know I've spoken with a couple of you about the fact electricity rates are lower in the fall.

1532
02:02:38,196 --> 02:02:39,477
[SPEAKER_29]: They're lower in the spring.

1533
02:02:40,097 --> 02:02:43,778
[SPEAKER_29]: You cannot get a good rate for electricity in the summer or the winter.

1534
02:02:43,798 --> 02:02:48,279
[SPEAKER_29]: So you actually do have to pay attention to when you're implementing the program.

1535
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:57,582
[SPEAKER_29]: So if this was approved tonight, our current plan, what we would like to do is to work with Good Energy, who is a consultant that MAPC

1536
02:02:58,175 --> 02:03:01,016
[SPEAKER_29]: has done a selection process for, has identified.

1537
02:03:01,436 --> 02:03:03,736
[SPEAKER_29]: I myself have met with them and looked at the documents.

1538
02:03:04,677 --> 02:03:14,379
[SPEAKER_29]: They would also actually aggregate our load with Somerville, Brookline, Gloucester, Woburn, Arlington, Winchester, Sudbury, and Stoneham, and possibly others.

1539
02:03:14,419 --> 02:03:19,260
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a few others they're still talking to, to get the best possible rate for our customers.

1540
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:22,361
[SPEAKER_29]: So they would not just put out Medford's electricity.

1541
02:03:22,661 --> 02:03:26,962
[SPEAKER_29]: They would put all of it and say to the companies, look at all these residents you would get,

1542
02:03:27,403 --> 02:03:29,143
[SPEAKER_29]: give us a good rate for this right now.

1543
02:03:30,143 --> 02:03:35,344
[SPEAKER_29]: And our goal would be for the new rates to take effect in January 2017, if not sooner.

1544
02:03:35,364 --> 02:03:39,845
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think that we could make this process move any faster than that.

1545
02:03:39,885 --> 02:03:48,947
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that would be the soonest that we could get it all done, but we would need, the goal is to have them buy the electricity this fall, or to make the contract this fall.

1546
02:03:50,027 --> 02:03:56,148
[SPEAKER_29]: So we do have some answers to some of the questions that you had asked previously, or if you have any other questions right now.

1547
02:03:59,268 --> 02:04:06,392
[SPEAKER_29]: So one of them was how many of the communities that have been doing, so this has been an option for almost 15 years now.

1548
02:04:07,092 --> 02:04:12,534
[SPEAKER_29]: And of the communities that have been doing it, how many stopped?

1549
02:04:12,774 --> 02:04:21,178
[SPEAKER_29]: And three of them have stopped, like out of all of them that have ever been approved, Ashland, Lunenburg, and Marlborough have stopped.

1550
02:04:21,558 --> 02:04:27,301
[SPEAKER_29]: And all of them are actually now in the process of reactivating and looking to go back into doing this as well.

1551
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:38,588
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that I was asked, sorry, it was, what's the opt-out rate, like how many people choose to opt out?

1552
02:04:38,968 --> 02:04:44,752
[SPEAKER_29]: So we're only able to really get that for the companies with good energy, because we don't have access to the other consultants' datas.

1553
02:04:45,293 --> 02:04:50,957
[SPEAKER_29]: So they have 24 municipalities in Massachusetts for whom they've already gone through the full process.

1554
02:04:51,537 --> 02:04:53,899
[SPEAKER_29]: Their average opt-out rate among residents is 6.5%.

1555
02:04:55,535 --> 02:05:01,037
[SPEAKER_29]: with a minimum of 4% and a maximum of 9% in those 24 municipalities.

1556
02:05:02,417 --> 02:05:03,617
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that was it.

1557
02:05:07,479 --> 02:05:08,259
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Vice President.

1558
02:05:08,339 --> 02:05:10,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President De La Rousseau.

1559
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:11,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1560
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Hunt, thank you for your explanation.

1561
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it answered some of my questions, too.

1562
02:05:14,741 --> 02:05:21,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to confirm, you said the residents could opt out with a simple phone call?

1563
02:05:22,398 --> 02:05:22,658
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1564
02:05:22,978 --> 02:05:24,779
[SPEAKER_29]: And so you have the experience with how they're doing it.

1565
02:05:24,919 --> 02:05:29,961
[SPEAKER_29]: So, um, the original opt out will actually be sent to them.

1566
02:05:30,882 --> 02:05:38,545
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, and they would have the choice of going on a web form and opting out through a phone call or they could send a paper letter if they so choose to do so.

1567
02:05:42,347 --> 02:05:48,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and how does the city plan on educating each, you know, rate payer?

1568
02:05:49,268 --> 02:05:52,710
[SPEAKER_10]: with regards to the possibility and the option to opt out?

1569
02:05:54,110 --> 02:05:59,493
[SPEAKER_29]: So part of what the consultant would do would be to design a plan for the city of Medford.

1570
02:05:59,893 --> 02:06:02,675
[SPEAKER_29]: So we're very open to how they should do that.

1571
02:06:03,415 --> 02:06:05,536
[SPEAKER_29]: But obviously, we have traditional methods.

1572
02:06:05,996 --> 02:06:09,798
[SPEAKER_29]: We would hope that our local paper would write one or more articles about it.

1573
02:06:09,818 --> 02:06:11,859
[SPEAKER_29]: And we'll certainly issue them press releases.

1574
02:06:12,479 --> 02:06:14,941
[SPEAKER_29]: But I think the articles are more stimulating sometimes.

1575
02:06:15,361 --> 02:06:17,622
[SPEAKER_29]: We would put stuff on the web, through Facebook,

1576
02:06:18,358 --> 02:06:21,480
[SPEAKER_29]: I would suspect that this would be worthy of a robocall.

1577
02:06:22,301 --> 02:06:24,502
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe the plan has to have a public meeting.

1578
02:06:24,522 --> 02:06:30,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

1579
02:06:31,186 --> 02:06:31,367
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1580
02:06:31,447 --> 02:06:33,628
[SPEAKER_29]: Everybody gets a paper mailing, at least one.

1581
02:06:34,809 --> 02:06:43,174
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I was trying to think about how you would roll the robocall in, because this would be something that you want to make sure residents hear about.

1582
02:06:43,735 --> 02:06:45,576
[SPEAKER_29]: And I feel like it's more than just

1583
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:49,262
[SPEAKER_29]: doing a call saying, hey, you got this in the mail, make sure you look at it.

1584
02:06:49,962 --> 02:06:54,585
[SPEAKER_29]: But trying to think about what would be, how you would best educate that.

1585
02:06:55,105 --> 02:07:00,068
[SPEAKER_29]: I would expect Good Energy would have a table at the Harvester Energy Festival to talk to people about it.

1586
02:07:00,548 --> 02:07:07,393
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would certainly see about my energy committee having some time at the farmer's market to let people know about it.

1587
02:07:07,673 --> 02:07:10,154
[SPEAKER_29]: Although I think that's a very small population.

1588
02:07:10,414 --> 02:07:15,037
[SPEAKER_29]: Although I think it's actually a pretty big population that comes there, but the same people every week.

1589
02:07:16,349 --> 02:07:17,650
[SPEAKER_10]: I was looking for the answer, too.

1590
02:07:18,410 --> 02:07:30,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything helps, but I was looking for the answer of the paper mailing, because we can try and try to get public educated, just like we tried to get them with the CPA, and obviously people were upset.

1591
02:07:31,059 --> 02:07:32,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people were upset with that.

1592
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:36,743
[SPEAKER_10]: So conventional methods aren't always the best.

1593
02:07:36,783 --> 02:07:38,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the paper mailing is definitely a must.

1594
02:07:39,705 --> 02:07:44,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the question I sent to you over the week, which I'm not sure if you addressed tonight,

1595
02:07:45,236 --> 02:07:51,198
[SPEAKER_10]: there's no possible way we can enter into the program with allowing people to opt-in.

1596
02:07:51,818 --> 02:07:54,079
[SPEAKER_29]: So let me, so I can clarify that.

1597
02:07:54,119 --> 02:07:57,840
[SPEAKER_29]: So a couple of people have asked overall about sort of having an opt-in program.

1598
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:03,982
[SPEAKER_29]: So the way the municipal aggregation law is written, you cannot, it requires opt-out.

1599
02:08:04,222 --> 02:08:13,105
[SPEAKER_29]: So if we were to say this is municipal aggregation, this is what we're doing, we're using this format through DPU, it cannot be an opt-in program, it has to be an opt-out.

1600
02:08:14,170 --> 02:08:21,616
[SPEAKER_29]: We have sort of looked into could you put out a solicitation, could you identify a company, that sort of thing.

1601
02:08:22,316 --> 02:08:38,809
[SPEAKER_29]: And there are other states where they do opt-in programs, and the take-up rate is so low that electricity companies, companies that sell electricity, don't want to give you a good rate because it's not a good enough number of people who opt into programs like that.

1602
02:08:39,489 --> 02:08:43,072
[SPEAKER_29]: Or if they're willing to give you a good rate, they don't give you very good terms.

1603
02:08:43,623 --> 02:08:55,390
[SPEAKER_29]: And so that's one of the things that we can also, like having this no termination fee is a big deal because many companies who want you to sign up as an individual have a large termination fee.

1604
02:08:55,771 --> 02:09:00,914
[SPEAKER_29]: And so that's actually one of the better terms that we can provide to residents.

1605
02:09:01,334 --> 02:09:07,598
[SPEAKER_29]: But if you do that, you wouldn't be able to control, you would either lose price or you would lose terms.

1606
02:09:08,038 --> 02:09:09,619
[SPEAKER_29]: based on experience in other state.

1607
02:09:10,119 --> 02:09:35,428
[SPEAKER_29]: I would also selfishly say it would be significantly more work for the municipality to do it in that sort of program as often, and I'm not sure that it would be worth it for, if we were gonna have 10% or 15% of people enroll in it, is it actually the best use of your municipal resources to be doing something like that when you're not gonna get them as good a rate as this would get you?

1608
02:09:37,795 --> 02:09:46,739
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can't guarantee, thank you for the answer, you can't guarantee price savings, so there's a possibility that the rates would be higher than what National Grid's offering?

1609
02:09:46,959 --> 02:09:49,340
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's sort of the problem with anything.

1610
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:51,200
[SPEAKER_29]: There's no guarantee, right?

1611
02:09:51,261 --> 02:09:57,403
[SPEAKER_29]: So we would contract in November, we would go out in that window, which is a traditionally good time.

1612
02:09:57,923 --> 02:10:04,666
[SPEAKER_29]: We would absolutely get a rate that is better than the current National Grid rate, or we wouldn't accept it.

1613
02:10:05,133 --> 02:10:07,955
[SPEAKER_29]: If they were offering us rates that were higher, we would say, no, thank you.

1614
02:10:08,496 --> 02:10:09,717
[SPEAKER_29]: We'll try again in the spring.

1615
02:10:10,337 --> 02:10:12,219
[SPEAKER_29]: So at that time, the rate would be lower.

1616
02:10:12,519 --> 02:10:18,885
[SPEAKER_29]: But because National Grid contracts buys electricity twice a year, something could happen to the electricity market.

1617
02:10:19,245 --> 02:10:24,129
[SPEAKER_29]: There could be a crazy dip in electricity prices, and they could drop dramatically.

1618
02:10:24,539 --> 02:10:26,020
[SPEAKER_29]: and we would have no control over that.

1619
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:30,441
[SPEAKER_29]: Residents would, they would still be allowed to opt out of the program.

1620
02:10:30,801 --> 02:10:35,043
[SPEAKER_29]: So if our rate was suddenly not better, they could choose to leave.

1621
02:10:35,803 --> 02:10:50,268
[SPEAKER_29]: Our goal is that on average over the course of the year, the rate is better, such that over the course of a year's use of electricity, the rate, what you pay is less than you would have paid if you'd stayed with National Grid that entire time.

1622
02:10:53,989 --> 02:11:01,151
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess my last question, because I see the problems, and that's where I'm having a problem with a yes vote right now.

1623
02:11:01,171 --> 02:11:04,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, you know, I'm on the fence.

1624
02:11:06,293 --> 02:11:07,073
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a tough issue.

1625
02:11:07,113 --> 02:11:15,616
[SPEAKER_10]: But my last question, you said this would go out to a public hearing and have to come back to the city council for definite approval.

1626
02:11:15,636 --> 02:11:18,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, that language in 16-534,

1627
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:26,283
[SPEAKER_10]: that we allow research development and participation in a contract throws me off.

1628
02:11:27,204 --> 02:11:27,464
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1629
02:11:27,744 --> 02:11:29,405
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that something you can answer?

1630
02:11:29,425 --> 02:11:31,727
[SPEAKER_29]: Because she's right.

1631
02:11:31,787 --> 02:11:32,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1632
02:11:32,467 --> 02:11:44,275
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think when it talks about the contract, I believe that's the contract with the consultant or the broker who's going to help design the plan and would eventually be your broker to take you out to bid.

1633
02:11:44,858 --> 02:11:47,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you don't approve the plan, then the process stops.

1634
02:11:47,859 --> 02:11:48,059
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1635
02:11:48,259 --> 02:11:50,040
[SPEAKER_29]: So actually, I think I can get that.

1636
02:11:50,881 --> 02:12:02,766
[SPEAKER_29]: So for example, I'm saying that if you approve it tonight, then we will sign something with Good Energy and MAPC that says, we want you to create a plan for us and get this project started.

1637
02:12:03,586 --> 02:12:10,529
[SPEAKER_29]: The point that it's of no return is the point at which the electricity prices come back to us in November.

1638
02:12:10,949 --> 02:12:14,671
[SPEAKER_29]: And if in November, the prices come back and the price is not good,

1639
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:17,442
[SPEAKER_29]: then we throw it out the window and we say we don't do it.

1640
02:12:17,862 --> 02:12:19,843
[SPEAKER_29]: And if the price is good, we would move forward.

1641
02:12:20,224 --> 02:12:34,434
[SPEAKER_29]: There is a, so in order for us to submit to DPU our outreach plan and our plan for how we're gonna do this, we have to be able to say that the Medford City Council saw this outreach plan and approved it.

1642
02:12:34,855 --> 02:12:42,941
[SPEAKER_29]: So at this point, you're approving us, allowing us to work with Good Energy to develop the plan, then you would have to approve the outreach plan

1643
02:12:43,552 --> 02:12:47,213
[SPEAKER_29]: before the Department of Public Utilities can review it.

1644
02:12:49,914 --> 02:12:51,334
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all the questions I have for now.

1645
02:12:51,354 --> 02:12:54,255
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate your passion for this issue.

1646
02:12:54,295 --> 02:13:00,657
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know it must make sense on a serious level.

1647
02:13:01,417 --> 02:13:04,298
[SPEAKER_10]: It just seems a little risky at the same time.

1648
02:13:04,538 --> 02:13:11,640
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't love the fact that people have to be put into the program and have to take the time, energy,

1649
02:13:14,009 --> 02:13:15,209
[SPEAKER_10]: know that they can opt out of it.

1650
02:13:15,289 --> 02:13:16,949
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where my concern lies.

1651
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:22,891
[SPEAKER_10]: But I appreciate, you know, you putting it together and starting the conversation, at least, depending on how my colleagues feel.

1652
02:13:22,971 --> 02:13:23,311
[SPEAKER_29]: So, thank you.

1653
02:13:23,371 --> 02:13:33,575
[SPEAKER_29]: If I might actually sort of point out the way this works is if we—if, say, you take the chance, we approve it tonight, and you

1654
02:13:34,811 --> 02:13:48,875
[SPEAKER_29]: decide in two weeks that this was a bad idea and you don't want us to do it and go further, maybe you hear from residents or whatever, then if the city council never approves the outreach plan, then I cannot submit it to DPO.

1655
02:13:49,055 --> 02:13:50,195
[SPEAKER_29]: They won't accept it from me.

1656
02:13:50,676 --> 02:13:54,757
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's like another place where you have another check.

1657
02:13:55,057 --> 02:13:59,058
[SPEAKER_29]: So it might be, well, I don't object to the outreach plan, but I'm not voting for it because I don't like it.

1658
02:13:59,577 --> 02:14:05,199
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't see why that would happen, because I think this is a really good program, or I wouldn't be bringing it to the city council.

1659
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:08,701
[SPEAKER_29]: But you do have that step in there.

1660
02:14:15,144 --> 02:14:15,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1661
02:14:15,604 --> 02:14:15,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1662
02:14:16,424 --> 02:14:17,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1663
02:14:17,705 --> 02:14:19,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falcone.

1664
02:14:19,645 --> 02:14:20,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1665
02:14:20,626 --> 02:14:21,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Alicia.

1666
02:14:22,387 --> 02:14:28,229
[SPEAKER_07]: So you had mentioned earlier, you had mentioned that three communities decided to get out,

1667
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:34,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we talked briefly about that at the Committee of the Whole.

1668
02:14:34,924 --> 02:14:37,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we figured out the length of contract.

1669
02:14:37,826 --> 02:14:47,792
[SPEAKER_07]: They only did it for a year, so they really couldn't get the discount that they wanted, because the length of the term wasn't really long enough to get the savings that they thought they were going to get.

1670
02:14:47,992 --> 02:14:48,852
[SPEAKER_29]: Right, six months.

1671
02:14:49,033 --> 02:14:49,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1672
02:14:51,754 --> 02:14:52,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So they decided to leave.

1673
02:14:53,956 --> 02:14:55,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we know why they're going back in now?

1674
02:14:56,486 --> 02:14:59,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it truly because of the terms?

1675
02:15:00,689 --> 02:15:09,734
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't speak completely to their situations, maybe Patrick can, but I can tell you that historically there was a period of time where this was considered a great idea.

1676
02:15:09,754 --> 02:15:18,300
[SPEAKER_29]: There was a period of time about five years ago where people thought that cities could make a lot of money from this and do great things.

1677
02:15:18,896 --> 02:15:21,337
[SPEAKER_29]: generate revenue for energy efficiency programs.

1678
02:15:21,737 --> 02:15:25,918
[SPEAKER_29]: And there were some consultants who actually tried to get us to get in on this windfall.

1679
02:15:25,958 --> 02:15:27,718
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm like, I don't like the sound of windfall.

1680
02:15:28,038 --> 02:15:29,218
[SPEAKER_29]: That makes me nervous.

1681
02:15:29,839 --> 02:15:30,679
[SPEAKER_29]: And we stepped back.

1682
02:15:30,739 --> 02:15:38,161
[SPEAKER_29]: We actually had Tufts students do a study on community aggregation on that time about three years ago, because I was here.

1683
02:15:38,201 --> 02:15:41,982
[SPEAKER_29]: Actually, it was when Kerry Dukes was still the director.

1684
02:15:43,082 --> 02:15:47,083
[SPEAKER_29]: The Tufts students did a study for MAPC and the city of Medford jointly.

1685
02:15:47,123 --> 02:15:47,963
[SPEAKER_29]: We were the clients.

1686
02:15:48,297 --> 02:15:50,778
[SPEAKER_29]: And they were like, you can't do this windfall stuff.

1687
02:15:50,939 --> 02:15:53,140
[SPEAKER_29]: This is not as good as it sounds.

1688
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:56,422
[SPEAKER_29]: And we were like, oh, and we backed off.

1689
02:15:57,262 --> 02:16:00,104
[SPEAKER_29]: What's happened now is the electricity market has gone way up.

1690
02:16:00,164 --> 02:16:01,845
[SPEAKER_29]: And electricity is way more expensive.

1691
02:16:02,005 --> 02:16:11,070
[SPEAKER_29]: And we can really get better rates for our residents by timing the market, by buying the electricity at a good time, by aggregating.

1692
02:16:11,471 --> 02:16:13,012
[SPEAKER_29]: So we know that we can do that.

1693
02:16:13,132 --> 02:16:17,134
[SPEAKER_29]: And we're not trying to go after a windfall that the city is going to get a pile of money.

1694
02:16:17,612 --> 02:16:19,133
[SPEAKER_29]: And so that's sort of been pushed off.

1695
02:16:19,934 --> 02:16:23,356
[SPEAKER_29]: These communities were part of it at that time.

1696
02:16:23,937 --> 02:16:26,398
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think there were some problems with that.

1697
02:16:26,759 --> 02:16:31,182
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm pretty sure that Lunenburg was one of the ones that was named in that report.

1698
02:16:31,622 --> 02:16:35,685
[SPEAKER_29]: I haven't actually pulled it back up as sketchy.

1699
02:16:36,045 --> 02:16:37,626
[SPEAKER_29]: It wasn't clear what was going on there.

1700
02:16:38,247 --> 02:16:38,887
[SPEAKER_29]: They stopped.

1701
02:16:39,307 --> 02:16:40,388
[SPEAKER_29]: They have new consultants.

1702
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:41,169
[SPEAKER_29]: They're starting over.

1703
02:16:41,209 --> 02:16:42,930
[SPEAKER_29]: They're doing it fresh.

1704
02:16:43,530 --> 02:16:43,771
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1705
02:16:44,231 --> 02:16:45,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So now, if I'm correct,

1706
02:16:46,657 --> 02:16:50,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently in our current state, I could go out and negotiate my own rate with a supplier, right?

1707
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:51,860
[SPEAKER_29]: In theory.

1708
02:16:52,060 --> 02:16:52,600
[SPEAKER_07]: In theory, okay.

1709
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:53,161
[SPEAKER_07]: In theory.

1710
02:16:53,181 --> 02:16:53,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1711
02:16:54,501 --> 02:16:58,263
[SPEAKER_29]: How much they would negotiate with an individual is the theoretical part.

1712
02:16:58,523 --> 02:16:59,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1713
02:16:59,584 --> 02:17:10,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because I know, I talk to a lot of just residents after the committee, the whole, and a lot of them actually seem to be interested, especially because if there could potentially be a savings there, why not?

1714
02:17:11,651 --> 02:17:15,933
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially if you can opt out, that seems to be a pretty good deal.

1715
02:17:16,421 --> 02:17:23,607
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the communities that have actually gone with this, do they find, is there an average cost savings over a year?

1716
02:17:23,627 --> 02:17:28,210
[SPEAKER_29]: I think, is there a number that's being sort of looked at?

1717
02:17:29,271 --> 02:17:40,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so for good energies programs that are being implemented currently for those 24 municipalities, they're looking, I think, towards the end of this year,

1718
02:17:41,217 --> 02:17:45,580
[SPEAKER_06]: for around, I think it's around like $60 per household.

1719
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:49,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But the range that they sort of would talk about expecting might be $40 to $120.

1720
02:17:49,723 --> 02:17:52,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you say that again?

1721
02:17:52,324 --> 02:17:53,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be $40 to $120.

1722
02:17:53,425 --> 02:17:59,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So it could possibly be in the range of savings per year between $40 and $120 a year.

1723
02:17:59,429 --> 02:17:59,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1724
02:18:01,530 --> 02:18:02,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1725
02:18:02,291 --> 02:18:05,573
[SPEAKER_29]: Of course, the more electricity you use, the more you save.

1726
02:18:05,673 --> 02:18:09,436
[SPEAKER_29]: But I don't like to say that because I would like everybody to use less electricity.

1727
02:18:09,496 --> 02:18:09,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1728
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:10,680
[SPEAKER_07]: deserve.

1729
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:12,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1730
02:18:13,361 --> 02:18:14,202
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor.

1731
02:18:16,383 --> 02:18:18,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

1732
02:18:18,643 --> 02:18:19,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1733
02:18:19,304 --> 02:18:20,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Alicia, I thank you.

1734
02:18:20,844 --> 02:18:25,326
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a good meeting last week, and I appreciate all the hard work you do for the city in saving energy.

1735
02:18:26,227 --> 02:18:32,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Since we last talked, I had the opportunity to talk to two electrical consultants that do similar work.

1736
02:18:32,349 --> 02:18:37,491
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them was a Constellation person, and he explained to me that when it works, it works.

1737
02:18:40,367 --> 02:18:43,508
[SPEAKER_11]: When it doesn't work, you get a problem, he says, especially on the city side.

1738
02:18:44,309 --> 02:18:57,593
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things he told me to ask is, is the city of Medford willing to accept any liability if the rate goes up and the residents start saying, hey, I'm paying more on my electric bill?

1739
02:18:58,814 --> 02:19:04,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are we willing to buy an insurance policy to cover the liability in the case that this does go up?

1740
02:19:08,252 --> 02:19:13,594
[SPEAKER_29]: taught by my lawyer friends that if you're asking about liability, we should ask the city solicitor, not me.

1741
02:19:13,674 --> 02:19:15,114
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't speak to liability.

1742
02:19:17,475 --> 02:19:20,416
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, actually, Patrick actually has an answer for you.

1743
02:19:20,436 --> 02:19:27,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would just like to say that in the aggregation programs that operate in Massachusetts, municipalities do not take out any additional insurance.

1744
02:19:31,711 --> 02:19:40,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Individuals can leave at any time, and so there is no contractual obligation for the city to pay a certain sum of money or to use a certain amount of energy.

1745
02:19:41,178 --> 02:19:45,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So if everyone left, that is a risk that the supplier takes.

1746
02:19:46,242 --> 02:19:52,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, in the other question you told me, it says most people don't opt out, because they never even were aware they were in the plan.

1747
02:19:52,747 --> 02:19:59,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Because again, like Mr. Dunman spoke a little earlier, we have a communication problem in the city.

1748
02:20:01,776 --> 02:20:03,857
[SPEAKER_11]: We have no access to television to get the message out.

1749
02:20:04,837 --> 02:20:10,120
[SPEAKER_11]: When we sweep the streets, I get a thousand phone calls, nobody told me, nobody knows.

1750
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:13,701
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been in the papers, and when there's a snow emergency, you get the same calls.

1751
02:20:13,781 --> 02:20:14,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know, nobody told me.

1752
02:20:15,742 --> 02:20:20,765
[SPEAKER_11]: How do we get to everybody in the whole city to say, I want in, I want out?

1753
02:20:21,585 --> 02:20:30,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, somebody owns a three-family house, so they get a bill there for the owner gets the bill, and what do they do with the tenants?

1754
02:20:31,165 --> 02:20:33,326
[SPEAKER_29]: Each tenant should be getting their own electric bill.

1755
02:20:34,046 --> 02:20:37,927
[SPEAKER_11]: In all due respect, most people don't, most people when they get the bill, they open and they pay it.

1756
02:20:38,167 --> 02:20:39,808
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't look at all those little things that are in there.

1757
02:20:40,868 --> 02:20:51,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, my other question is, um, if more people start opting out, uh, how does that affect your rate, our rate to the city?

1758
02:20:51,272 --> 02:20:53,233
[SPEAKER_11]: If, if, if more than six or 7% does that,

1759
02:20:54,438 --> 02:21:06,120
[SPEAKER_29]: So this, one of the terms, so when you go out and buy electricity, you look at the terms, and the terms include what if your usage varies, that your contractual usage varies.

1760
02:21:06,460 --> 02:21:18,982
[SPEAKER_29]: And so one of the terms that we would look for was something that your friends at Constellation would understand, 100% swing, which means that if 100% of the people opted out, it would be no effect, it would be no change.

1761
02:21:20,082 --> 02:21:23,823
[SPEAKER_29]: So that would not have an impact on the program if everybody chose to opt out.

1762
02:21:24,579 --> 02:21:27,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, we're also going to be dependent on advice from an outside source.

1763
02:21:28,922 --> 02:21:31,464
[SPEAKER_11]: So what if the person we hire gives us bad advice?

1764
02:21:31,484 --> 02:21:38,430
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, that's a risk we take every time we hire a consultant, but if we never—but we can't all be expected to know everything.

1765
02:21:38,470 --> 02:21:39,971
[SPEAKER_29]: That's why consultants exist.

1766
02:21:40,471 --> 02:21:45,215
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm also told that, you know, I know you said about National Grid.

1767
02:21:45,235 --> 02:21:52,380
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also told that when you opt out of National Grid and you want back in, they're not the happiest person to let you go back in, and you may not get brought in.

1768
02:21:53,792 --> 02:21:55,453
[SPEAKER_11]: at the same rate you went out at either.

1769
02:21:55,853 --> 02:21:58,234
[SPEAKER_29]: So by law, National Grid has to take you back?

1770
02:21:58,454 --> 02:22:00,335
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll take you back, but they don't have to give you the same rate.

1771
02:22:00,675 --> 02:22:06,418
[SPEAKER_29]: I do want to point out that Good Energy and Constellation are direct competitors, just so you're aware of that.

1772
02:22:06,939 --> 02:22:10,740
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I talked to a couple of them, two different companies.

1773
02:22:11,661 --> 02:22:16,583
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, I'm afraid for the city liability end.

1774
02:22:18,244 --> 02:22:19,825
[SPEAKER_11]: If the rate goes up, if something goes bad,

1775
02:22:21,306 --> 02:22:25,648
[SPEAKER_11]: I can hear everyone's phone is going to scream on the thing.

1776
02:22:26,769 --> 02:22:36,235
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I have no problem doing this on a voluntary basis, but I don't know if we have the ability to get the word out to everybody that has an electric bill in the city.

1777
02:22:37,356 --> 02:22:40,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we say we just don't have the resources to do that.

1778
02:22:40,898 --> 02:22:47,642
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, and also, maybe before we vote on this, I prefer maybe have a public hearing.

1779
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:53,363
[SPEAKER_11]: with a robot with a call going out to say to me, listen, this is what we're going to do.

1780
02:22:53,583 --> 02:22:54,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's have a public meeting.

1781
02:22:54,784 --> 02:22:56,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, I have an all-electric house.

1782
02:22:56,165 --> 02:22:58,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the first guy looking to save money on electric.

1783
02:22:58,546 --> 02:23:00,607
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, I'll, you know, so.

1784
02:23:02,429 --> 02:23:08,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, but I'm just, I'm afraid that if it doesn't go good, it's not going to go good for the room, yeah.

1785
02:23:09,193 --> 02:23:17,898
[SPEAKER_29]: So, I would suggest respectfully that a public hearing on something very concrete, like a plan presented by the consultant,

1786
02:23:18,447 --> 02:23:27,932
[SPEAKER_29]: would potentially be useful, but that a public hearing on a theoretical idea would be very difficult for residents to get their teeth into and to understand.

1787
02:23:28,352 --> 02:23:33,314
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I would like to take it to that step where we have a plan that the public could weigh in on.

1788
02:23:33,734 --> 02:23:42,819
[SPEAKER_29]: And if the public was then opposed to a municipal aggregation, you would then disapprove the plan at that time.

1789
02:23:42,979 --> 02:23:44,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I have reservations.

1790
02:23:45,805 --> 02:23:50,608
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unfortunate that the city of Medford is in the function hall business that some people want us to get into.

1791
02:23:50,628 --> 02:23:53,830
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the auditorium business that we shouldn't be in.

1792
02:23:53,850 --> 02:23:56,811
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if we need to be in the electric business.

1793
02:23:57,352 --> 02:23:59,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we have a hard time doing government sometimes.

1794
02:23:59,933 --> 02:24:04,796
[SPEAKER_29]: So this is providing an additional choice for our residents that they don't otherwise have.

1795
02:24:05,316 --> 02:24:11,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I have reservations and I would want more public input before I made a decision on this.

1796
02:24:16,696 --> 02:24:17,517
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councillor.

1797
02:24:20,699 --> 02:24:22,180
[SPEAKER_20]: Chair recognizes Councillor Knight.

1798
02:24:23,381 --> 02:24:24,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1799
02:24:25,002 --> 02:24:26,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you both for being here this evening too.

1800
02:24:26,384 --> 02:24:28,345
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate your presentation.

1801
02:24:29,366 --> 02:24:41,115
[SPEAKER_16]: So as I understand it, based upon what you're telling us, the paper before us is for the city council to authorize your office via the mayor to enter into a contract with the MAPC in good energy.

1802
02:24:41,670 --> 02:24:41,910
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1803
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:46,772
[SPEAKER_16]: And how did the MAPC and Good Energy become the people that we said, these are the ones we're going to go with?

1804
02:24:47,672 --> 02:24:54,534
[SPEAKER_29]: So MAPC does regional procurements on a variety of various topics, and sometimes it makes sense to work with them.

1805
02:24:55,155 --> 02:24:57,896
[SPEAKER_29]: I had met with Good Energy as well a few times.

1806
02:24:58,316 --> 02:25:03,477
[SPEAKER_29]: I've actually met with other consultants about this in the past as well when I was less enamored of the program.

1807
02:25:04,658 --> 02:25:10,840
[SPEAKER_29]: MAPC went out and did a full search, a request for qualifications, reviewed various programs.

1808
02:25:11,826 --> 02:25:18,133
[SPEAKER_29]: What I really actually like best about their program is Good Energy has been working with the Mass Energy Consumer Alliance.

1809
02:25:18,607 --> 02:25:23,169
[SPEAKER_29]: to include this additional clean energy as part of the purchase.

1810
02:25:23,609 --> 02:25:31,051
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a proposal that's a new idea from them that other consultants had not thought of before.

1811
02:25:32,112 --> 02:25:33,692
[SPEAKER_29]: It actually came out of Melrose.

1812
02:25:34,372 --> 02:25:47,897
[SPEAKER_29]: And I really like how this would, by everybody having a tiny bit more renewable energy, it would actually be a pretty significant renewable energy credit purchase on behalf of the city.

1813
02:25:48,428 --> 02:25:51,689
[SPEAKER_29]: and make an impact on our greenhouse gases.

1814
02:25:52,249 --> 02:25:56,931
[SPEAKER_29]: So that is actually particularly why I'm interested in this specific program.

1815
02:25:58,552 --> 02:26:01,793
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the cost of usually doing business historically?

1816
02:26:01,833 --> 02:26:07,355
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure Good Energy and the MAPC have gotten together and entered into these contracts in the past with municipalities.

1817
02:26:07,415 --> 02:26:09,435
[SPEAKER_15]: And what's the average cost for a contract like that?

1818
02:26:09,475 --> 02:26:16,858
[SPEAKER_29]: So the way they would be paid is that they are paid a very tiny percentage on the electrical bill.

1819
02:26:17,335 --> 02:26:23,881
[SPEAKER_29]: So the city of Medford would not actually pay the MAPC or Good Energy directly.

1820
02:26:25,582 --> 02:26:36,772
[SPEAKER_29]: Residents pay their bills to National Grid, passes the money to whoever it is that the contract is with for the supply, and the supplier gives them a very tiny percentage.

1821
02:26:38,253 --> 02:26:42,037
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe it's one thousandth of a penny.

1822
02:26:43,358 --> 02:26:44,479
[SPEAKER_29]: One thousandth of a penny.

1823
02:26:45,064 --> 02:26:46,406
[SPEAKER_29]: per kilowatt hour.

1824
02:26:46,727 --> 02:26:48,550
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, one one thousandth of a dollar.

1825
02:26:50,112 --> 02:26:52,095
[SPEAKER_29]: One one hundredth of a penny.

1826
02:26:52,396 --> 02:26:56,683
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's a fraction of a penny per kilowatt hour that the consultant.

1827
02:27:19,479 --> 02:27:21,621
[SPEAKER_06]: $100,000?

1828
02:27:20,981 --> 02:27:21,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, for the year.

1829
02:27:22,002 --> 02:27:22,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Per annum?

1830
02:27:23,764 --> 02:27:29,310
[SPEAKER_29]: And so that would be for all the outreach and stuff that they do, the buying of the electricity.

1831
02:27:30,751 --> 02:27:33,915
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reason I ask is because it seems like

1832
02:27:34,316 --> 02:27:36,056
[SPEAKER_16]: This is going to be a contract that's over $10,000.

1833
02:27:36,316 --> 02:27:40,557
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like it's something you're negotiating, and you've selected the vendors already.

1834
02:27:40,977 --> 02:27:45,498
[SPEAKER_16]: We might be able to get more bang for our buck if we put out an IRP and said, three vendors come and give it to us.

1835
02:27:45,858 --> 02:27:49,219
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if we can do that through municipal aggregation, and I guess that's one of the questions.

1836
02:27:49,279 --> 02:27:49,479
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1837
02:27:49,499 --> 02:27:56,741
[SPEAKER_29]: So part of actually why I like sometimes doing regional procurements is because this was a procurement on behalf of a lot of municipalities.

1838
02:27:57,261 --> 02:28:03,362
[SPEAKER_29]: So if we went out right now, we would be doing it on behalf of Medford and asking a consultant to work with just Medford.

1839
02:28:03,837 --> 02:28:08,501
[SPEAKER_29]: Right now, Good Energy is working with, who are the ones that are going out right now?

1840
02:28:08,541 --> 02:28:10,182
[SPEAKER_29]: About eight or ten?

1841
02:28:10,202 --> 02:28:11,764
[SPEAKER_29]: The one, all those that I just listed.

1842
02:28:12,264 --> 02:28:13,245
[SPEAKER_16]: So actually.

1843
02:28:13,265 --> 02:28:14,466
[SPEAKER_16]: The RFP is going out.

1844
02:28:14,606 --> 02:28:17,068
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, I mean, a request for proposals and bids are going out.

1845
02:28:17,108 --> 02:28:18,429
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are doing it on a larger scale.

1846
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:18,990
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1847
02:28:19,050 --> 02:28:21,112
[SPEAKER_29]: They do it on a larger scale when they can do it on behalf.

1848
02:28:21,132 --> 02:28:22,713
[SPEAKER_16]: They're doing the administrative work for us.

1849
02:28:23,133 --> 02:28:23,373
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1850
02:28:23,453 --> 02:28:26,456
[SPEAKER_29]: And so they actually did the administrative work.

1851
02:28:26,676 --> 02:28:32,381
[SPEAKER_29]: If we were to start from scratch right now, we would do a request for qualifications for consultants

1852
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:35,842
[SPEAKER_29]: we would have to have, I would have to have a procurement officer on board.

1853
02:28:35,862 --> 02:28:40,685
[SPEAKER_29]: That would take period would take a couple of months, a couple, two months easily.

1854
02:28:41,025 --> 02:28:44,587
[SPEAKER_29]: And then, um, we would then start the rest of this process.

1855
02:28:44,807 --> 02:28:51,832
[SPEAKER_29]: So we would not be able to do it for this winter because we could never complete it just by the legal procurement laws by this winter.

1856
02:28:51,992 --> 02:28:56,415
[SPEAKER_29]: And so it would be another year before Medford residents would see reduced electricity rates.

1857
02:28:56,655 --> 02:28:59,637
[SPEAKER_16]: So what I'm understanding is that good energy is the,

1858
02:29:00,365 --> 02:29:05,107
[SPEAKER_16]: preferred vendor that's been selected by MAPC through their due diligence process?

1859
02:29:05,127 --> 02:29:06,287
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, through their due diligence.

1860
02:29:06,567 --> 02:29:06,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1861
02:29:07,288 --> 02:29:22,553
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you were filling me in on some of these questions that I had, I did hear you say, so we'd get a bill and a bill would come in the mail and it would be, today it's national grid, tomorrow we're entering into municipal aggregation.

1862
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it, you know, good guy energy or is it still a national grid bill?

1863
02:29:25,581 --> 02:29:27,281
[SPEAKER_29]: The bill would still be national grid.

1864
02:29:27,861 --> 02:29:30,582
[SPEAKER_29]: And there's one line on that bill that says supply.

1865
02:29:30,602 --> 02:29:34,262
[SPEAKER_29]: And in that place, it would be, it would not say good energy.

1866
02:29:36,643 --> 02:29:36,863
[SPEAKER_29]: Sorry.

1867
02:29:37,003 --> 02:29:38,343
[SPEAKER_29]: It would not say good energy.

1868
02:29:38,563 --> 02:29:42,824
[SPEAKER_29]: It would say the name of whoever the electricity ended up being purchased from.

1869
02:29:42,844 --> 02:29:50,406
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, for example, direct energy is a company that, uh, I can't even remember who this is.

1870
02:29:50,996 --> 02:29:55,401
[SPEAKER_16]: we might contract with.

1871
02:29:55,601 --> 02:30:02,028
[SPEAKER_16]: We enter into a three-year contract for municipal aggregation, and I decide to opt out.

1872
02:30:04,611 --> 02:30:06,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Two and a half, I say, I want to opt back in.

1873
02:30:06,853 --> 02:30:11,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I allowed to opt out and in as many times as I want with no penalty, no charge, no fee, no pain, no suffering?

1874
02:30:11,645 --> 02:30:12,365
[SPEAKER_28]: I have no idea.

1875
02:30:12,905 --> 02:30:14,886
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

1876
02:30:15,126 --> 02:30:21,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally, I believe when you opt out, you can get back in at the next contract start.

1877
02:30:22,668 --> 02:30:32,570
[SPEAKER_06]: We have seen, in a rare case, I think the city of Lowell has gone three years, but most cities go one or two years, often a lot do one year for their first year of the program, too.

1878
02:30:32,590 --> 02:30:36,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you opt out, you're up for the term of the contract.

1879
02:30:36,191 --> 02:30:41,232
[SPEAKER_29]: You would opt out for the rest of that term of the contract, and then you could come in on the next contract.

1880
02:30:41,612 --> 02:30:45,393
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the scope of contract would be limited to a three year contract by law because it's a municipal contract.

1881
02:30:45,413 --> 02:30:50,775
[SPEAKER_29]: Right, so you would never actually strategically buy electricity for any longer than three years either.

1882
02:30:52,235 --> 02:30:57,336
[SPEAKER_29]: Right now, one to two year contracts seem to be the right length of time to enter into.

1883
02:30:57,836 --> 02:31:00,777
[SPEAKER_29]: Things are in flux in the electricity utility world.

1884
02:31:01,117 --> 02:31:03,298
[SPEAKER_29]: Longer than that, you don't know what you're getting into.

1885
02:31:07,395 --> 02:31:08,796
[SPEAKER_16]: That answers all my questions, Mr. President.

1886
02:31:08,816 --> 02:31:09,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1887
02:31:09,397 --> 02:31:10,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for your time.

1888
02:31:10,317 --> 02:31:10,617
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate it.

1889
02:31:11,858 --> 02:31:15,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1890
02:31:15,661 --> 02:31:17,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

1891
02:31:18,623 --> 02:31:19,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1892
02:31:20,124 --> 02:31:21,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ms.

1893
02:31:21,205 --> 02:31:22,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Hunt, for everything you do.

1894
02:31:22,946 --> 02:31:27,209
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so important that you're involved in our community and pushing us in the right direction.

1895
02:31:27,249 --> 02:31:35,515
[SPEAKER_02]: But my question is, for those people that have been proactive and they've purchased their own electricity and they like their rate,

1896
02:31:37,966 --> 02:31:40,347
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen to those people?

1897
02:31:40,647 --> 02:31:47,210
[SPEAKER_29]: For anybody who has already contracted with another company for their supply, they would not be included in this automatically.

1898
02:31:47,751 --> 02:31:54,474
[SPEAKER_29]: They would have to independently exit that contract if they wanted to be part of this, but they would not be automatically included.

1899
02:31:54,514 --> 02:32:01,618
[SPEAKER_29]: This is only for people and businesses on the default rate, not on—who already have a supply.

1900
02:32:02,530 --> 02:32:07,792
[SPEAKER_29]: So it would actually include all small businesses that have not gotten outside contracts.

1901
02:32:08,312 --> 02:32:10,953
[SPEAKER_29]: They would be included in this as well, the better rate.

1902
02:32:12,134 --> 02:32:16,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm with Zoom Energy and my rate is better, I can stay?

1903
02:32:17,176 --> 02:32:18,916
[SPEAKER_29]: You in fact would stay.

1904
02:32:18,936 --> 02:32:19,897
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1905
02:32:20,077 --> 02:32:27,299
[SPEAKER_29]: You could only join if you made an effort and you contacted them and quit being with them and then asked to be part of it.

1906
02:32:29,848 --> 02:32:31,469
[SPEAKER_29]: we would not automatically enroll you.

1907
02:32:31,489 --> 02:32:32,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So wouldn't, okay.

1908
02:32:32,370 --> 02:32:48,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, that, that, that was my biggest fear is like what Councilor Caviello said, the lack of information sharing is probably my biggest fear as well.

1909
02:32:48,503 --> 02:32:52,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm making sure that we have those ants, those questions answered.

1910
02:32:53,066 --> 02:32:53,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1911
02:32:53,446 --> 02:32:57,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can, so constituents don't fall into that, that same situation.

1912
02:32:57,870 --> 02:32:57,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

1913
02:32:58,606 --> 02:33:02,729
[SPEAKER_29]: So we do have residents who have contracted with other companies.

1914
02:33:03,850 --> 02:33:11,596
[SPEAKER_29]: My general, what we've generally seen is that those companies offer a good rate but very difficult terms for ending the contract.

1915
02:33:12,177 --> 02:33:19,682
[SPEAKER_29]: And in fact, they do end contracts but keep you on with them at the, what they call the market rate.

1916
02:33:19,762 --> 02:33:28,169
[SPEAKER_29]: But because the market fluctuates hour to hour, they tend to charge varying amounts and nobody can say whether those amounts are reasonable or not.

1917
02:33:28,831 --> 02:33:38,247
[SPEAKER_29]: One of the benefits that this provides is that we, our consultant, would know when this contract was ending and would make arrangements.

1918
02:33:59,358 --> 02:34:02,499
[SPEAKER_29]: because it's the better rate right now, and that's what our consultant.

1919
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:06,681
[SPEAKER_29]: We have a contract.

1920
02:34:09,402 --> 02:34:10,942
[SPEAKER_29]: National grid can offer us.

1921
02:34:10,962 --> 02:34:11,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1922
02:34:14,864 --> 02:34:16,264
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor Schiappelli.

1923
02:34:18,185 --> 02:34:20,706
[SPEAKER_20]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

1924
02:34:21,606 --> 02:34:22,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1925
02:34:24,307 --> 02:34:25,687
[SPEAKER_07]: One quick question.

1926
02:34:25,707 --> 02:34:27,888
[SPEAKER_07]: That is, do we know how many

1927
02:34:28,873 --> 02:34:31,134
[SPEAKER_07]: residents in Medford are on the default rate?

1928
02:34:32,955 --> 02:34:33,816
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd like a percentage.

1929
02:34:33,856 --> 02:34:34,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any idea?

1930
02:34:35,597 --> 02:34:36,357
[SPEAKER_29]: Percentage?

1931
02:34:36,377 --> 02:34:36,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1932
02:34:36,997 --> 02:34:40,339
[SPEAKER_29]: I would, I mean, I'm going to guess easily 95% of residents.

1933
02:34:40,399 --> 02:34:41,180
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1934
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:50,825
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, not of necessarily our load because large businesses, the hospital tops, those big eight companies, they use a lot of electricity.

1935
02:34:51,645 --> 02:34:54,827
[SPEAKER_29]: I would hope that they've all actually gone through this process themselves.

1936
02:34:55,310 --> 02:34:56,610
[SPEAKER_29]: and contracted separately.

1937
02:34:56,810 --> 02:35:04,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, just thinking and talking to people in the community, it just seems like most people would be on the default, right?

1938
02:35:04,273 --> 02:35:07,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think they're just not aware of what they can do with regard to electric.

1939
02:35:07,454 --> 02:35:13,135
[SPEAKER_29]: And a lot of them have had their doors knocked on by companies that are trying to get them to sign up.

1940
02:35:13,155 --> 02:35:21,378
[SPEAKER_29]: And part of my concern, there is another reason to do this, and that is that those companies offer poor terms.

1941
02:35:22,228 --> 02:35:29,831
[SPEAKER_29]: And I have to be careful, because I can't legally speak poorly of any specific company, but there have been problems with them.

1942
02:35:30,091 --> 02:35:42,896
[SPEAKER_29]: And if you looked at, like, exposés on the news, and the people who are most likely to end up signed up with one is actually somebody who is extremely careful and watches their bills very, very closely and has read all those terms.

1943
02:35:43,416 --> 02:35:46,117
[SPEAKER_29]: Or sometimes we have people who don't pay attention.

1944
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:55,065
[SPEAKER_29]: think they've gotten a really good deal, and then a year down the road, they're suddenly getting huge electric bills, and they don't know why or what to do about it.

1945
02:35:56,065 --> 02:35:57,446
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I get nervous.

1946
02:35:57,546 --> 02:36:12,394
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is a way of once you've done this in the city, those companies probably, as their experience, don't go door to door in your community anymore, because you're all signed up already with somebody else.

1947
02:36:12,874 --> 02:36:12,934
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1948
02:36:13,495 --> 02:36:14,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1949
02:36:17,857 --> 02:36:18,677
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor.

1950
02:36:18,877 --> 02:36:20,438
[SPEAKER_22]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1951
02:36:21,958 --> 02:36:22,979
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1952
02:36:23,199 --> 02:36:29,120
[SPEAKER_22]: And Alicia, I appreciate the time and effort, and also the gentleman next to you who appeared before the Committee of the Whole meeting.

1953
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:34,422
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a little different slant on this, and I think I mentioned it at the Committee of the Whole meeting.

1954
02:36:35,622 --> 02:36:42,744
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't feel comfortable as an elected official dictating to residents who their supplier should be.

1955
02:36:43,104 --> 02:36:46,665
[SPEAKER_22]: That's, first, my fundamental difference with this.

1956
02:36:47,459 --> 02:36:49,100
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm all in favor of giving savings.

1957
02:36:49,180 --> 02:37:04,004
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's a great concept and I think we could have some type of voluntary plan where the city goes out and procures a supplier to come in, a reputable supplier, and you get as many residents who voluntarily want to sign up and good luck to them.

1958
02:37:04,984 --> 02:37:11,146
[SPEAKER_22]: Second point is that this would have been an easier pill to swallow if you came to us and said, you know what?

1959
02:37:12,818 --> 02:37:20,299
[SPEAKER_22]: The city of Method wants to embark on this particular plan, this aggregation plan.

1960
02:37:21,059 --> 02:37:23,720
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're not going to consider the residents right now.

1961
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:26,180
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have the city embark on it.

1962
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:30,161
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have all the municipal buildings go into this municipal aggregation.

1963
02:37:30,681 --> 02:37:36,402
[SPEAKER_22]: In over a two-year process, we're going to let the residents know how much money we saved as a city.

1964
02:37:36,962 --> 02:37:38,803
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we're going to roll out to the residents.

1965
02:37:39,343 --> 02:37:40,723
[SPEAKER_22]: But what we're doing is the reverse.

1966
02:37:41,492 --> 02:37:43,713
[SPEAKER_22]: The city's not going to get involved in this, is that correct?

1967
02:37:44,714 --> 02:37:55,421
[SPEAKER_29]: The city actually already has a secondary supplier for our electricity rates, and we've had that one for longer than I've worked for the city, but we contract periodically for that.

1968
02:37:55,441 --> 02:37:57,122
[SPEAKER_22]: But the city is not taking part of this.

1969
02:37:57,702 --> 02:38:10,350
[SPEAKER_22]: So whatever is decided with this particular proposal, because there's a lot of things that have to be decided with the proposal, we can go through the organizational and role responsibility of the public entity.

1970
02:38:10,737 --> 02:38:13,458
[SPEAKER_22]: We can go through the degree of local control.

1971
02:38:13,918 --> 02:38:20,780
[SPEAKER_22]: We can go through the energy service side, renewable energy components, what percentage you want to have for renewable energy.

1972
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:22,660
[SPEAKER_22]: The city's not going to partake in that.

1973
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:25,861
[SPEAKER_22]: You're already out in your own little island doing whatever you're doing.

1974
02:38:26,401 --> 02:38:27,982
[SPEAKER_22]: So you're separating it now.

1975
02:38:28,382 --> 02:38:30,703
[SPEAKER_22]: You're separating the residents from the city.

1976
02:38:31,223 --> 02:38:32,423
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that's a mistake.

1977
02:38:32,863 --> 02:38:39,325
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think whatever was done, maybe you should have included the city to take part in this as well as the residents all at once.

1978
02:38:40,443 --> 02:38:41,604
[SPEAKER_22]: so we could do this together.

1979
02:38:42,584 --> 02:38:45,107
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that was the number one mistake that was made.

1980
02:38:46,228 --> 02:38:50,992
[SPEAKER_22]: Second point, when the city comes to me and says, you know what, we're going to save you money, guess what?

1981
02:38:51,312 --> 02:38:53,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Big red flag goes off in my head.

1982
02:38:53,774 --> 02:38:54,575
[SPEAKER_22]: Big red flag.

1983
02:38:55,155 --> 02:39:05,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Because if the city was that concerned, they would have looked at my cable bill five years ago and said, you know what, you're paying for a community access station that we haven't provided in five years.

1984
02:39:06,660 --> 02:39:08,881
[SPEAKER_22]: They would have saved me money then for the last five years.

1985
02:39:09,222 --> 02:39:12,744
[SPEAKER_22]: The city is not in the business of saving residents money.

1986
02:39:13,024 --> 02:39:14,625
[SPEAKER_22]: You know that as well as I know.

1987
02:39:14,645 --> 02:39:18,327
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just not in the business of saving residents money.

1988
02:39:18,607 --> 02:39:21,649
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's the second red flag in this particular proposal.

1989
02:39:22,429 --> 02:39:24,771
[SPEAKER_22]: The way I read it too, you mentioned about ARPA,

1990
02:39:25,796 --> 02:39:27,819
[SPEAKER_22]: This is from the Department of Energy Resources.

1991
02:39:28,240 --> 02:39:37,772
[SPEAKER_22]: It says, in a municipal aggregation, customers have the right to return to standard offer service without penalty by opting out before enrollment or up to 180 days after enrollment.

1992
02:39:39,536 --> 02:39:40,556
[SPEAKER_22]: Has that changed?

1993
02:39:40,696 --> 02:39:42,437
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's actually different.

1994
02:39:43,637 --> 02:39:50,658
[SPEAKER_29]: If you, if the program rolls out and over the first bill or two, suddenly a resident says, Hey, I didn't sign up for that.

1995
02:39:51,358 --> 02:39:59,119
[SPEAKER_29]: They can actually be removed from the program and charged for those previous two months as if they had never been in it.

1996
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:03,360
[SPEAKER_29]: So if this rate was lower than national grid, they would suddenly owe the difference.

1997
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:07,901
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, if this rate was higher, but we would never contract if this rate was higher.

1998
02:40:08,280 --> 02:40:18,766
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's talking about them withdrawing as if they had never been in it, as opposed to opting out of the program at any time, where you say, I've had my six months of savings.

1999
02:40:19,426 --> 02:40:21,287
[SPEAKER_29]: Now I don't want to be in this.

2000
02:40:21,348 --> 02:40:23,649
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to go back to the default rate.

2001
02:40:24,269 --> 02:40:25,250
[SPEAKER_29]: Then they can opt out.

2002
02:40:25,310 --> 02:40:29,392
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's a different piece there, subtlety.

2003
02:40:30,293 --> 02:40:32,854
[SPEAKER_22]: So the state legislature was wise when they created this.

2004
02:40:33,354 --> 02:40:36,116
[SPEAKER_22]: They created an opt-out rather than an opt-in.

2005
02:40:36,601 --> 02:40:38,403
[SPEAKER_22]: Because if it was an opt-in, you'd probably be at 6%.

2006
02:40:39,704 --> 02:40:41,046
[SPEAKER_22]: You'd probably be at the reverse.

2007
02:40:41,566 --> 02:40:42,467
[SPEAKER_22]: So they were smart.

2008
02:40:42,487 --> 02:40:44,009
[SPEAKER_22]: They said, take on the masses.

2009
02:40:44,429 --> 02:40:48,353
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the masses aren't going to be wise enough, because they're not going to get the notification.

2010
02:40:48,914 --> 02:40:54,019
[SPEAKER_22]: And a majority of the people are going to stay on there, because they're not even aware that the electricity was changed.

2011
02:40:54,399 --> 02:40:55,140
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not even aware.

2012
02:40:55,473 --> 02:40:57,955
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, and I'm not saying this is a bad idea.

2013
02:40:58,095 --> 02:41:05,862
[SPEAKER_22]: I just fundamentally disagree with me deciding what someone's supply is going to be.

2014
02:41:06,423 --> 02:41:08,825
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think that's my role as an elected official.

2015
02:41:09,665 --> 02:41:11,587
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think I should be in that business.

2016
02:41:12,668 --> 02:41:17,012
[SPEAKER_22]: Secondly, we're hearing a lot about having the council take a vote, take a vote, take a vote.

2017
02:41:18,273 --> 02:41:20,475
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't know the cost of implementing the program.

2018
02:41:21,113 --> 02:41:23,654
[SPEAKER_22]: And you're saying all these other cities and towns that have already done it.

2019
02:41:24,055 --> 02:41:32,640
[SPEAKER_22]: The cost of implementing the program in terms of staff time, external consultants necessary to design and operate the load aggregation plan, that's number one.

2020
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:39,904
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the city needs to determine whether or not if this cost outweighs what the benefit is going to be to the residents.

2021
02:41:40,564 --> 02:41:43,125
[SPEAKER_22]: So why isn't that presented to me first?

2022
02:41:43,626 --> 02:41:45,407
[SPEAKER_29]: So there is no request for money.

2023
02:41:45,487 --> 02:41:49,209
[SPEAKER_29]: The only cost to the city is some of my staff time.

2024
02:41:49,767 --> 02:41:53,030
[SPEAKER_29]: There is no charge to the city for a consultant.

2025
02:41:53,470 --> 02:42:00,656
[SPEAKER_29]: So there will be no future charges and there will be no money gained by the city from this program.

2026
02:42:00,716 --> 02:42:10,504
[SPEAKER_29]: So there's no reason for us to trick residents into joining it or the state legislature to trick them because they don't, the state doesn't get money out of this and the city doesn't.

2027
02:42:10,544 --> 02:42:12,206
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you saying we're not going to hire a consultant?

2028
02:42:13,045 --> 02:42:20,630
[SPEAKER_29]: We, so the consultant is paid out of a slight, a small amount on the electricity bill.

2029
02:42:20,670 --> 02:42:20,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2030
02:42:21,610 --> 02:42:22,751
[SPEAKER_29]: On the electricity bill.

2031
02:42:23,291 --> 02:42:26,574
[SPEAKER_29]: So we don't directly pay the consultant.

2032
02:42:26,654 --> 02:42:26,834
[SPEAKER_29]: No.

2033
02:42:27,054 --> 02:42:27,234
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

2034
02:42:27,934 --> 02:42:36,860
[SPEAKER_22]: And who decides what percent of, uh, the, um, renewable energy is going to be part of a particular program.

2035
02:42:37,540 --> 02:42:39,922
[SPEAKER_29]: So there's an amount regulated by state law.

2036
02:42:40,399 --> 02:42:40,899
[SPEAKER_29]: This year, it's 11%.

2037
02:42:41,380 --> 02:42:43,221
[SPEAKER_29]: It goes up 1% annually.

2038
02:42:44,401 --> 02:42:49,885
[SPEAKER_29]: The amount on top of that is an amount that we've been discussing with consultants in other municipalities.

2039
02:42:50,405 --> 02:43:00,471
[SPEAKER_29]: How much can you buy that it makes a difference and it's worthwhile, but does not impact significantly the price that residents would pay?

2040
02:43:00,631 --> 02:43:02,552
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm asking, who makes the decision?

2041
02:43:03,613 --> 02:43:07,295
[SPEAKER_22]: What percentage of renewable energy will be part of this proposal?

2042
02:43:09,508 --> 02:43:14,912
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, I haven't had this discussion with the current mayor, but the former mayor said he made all decisions.

2043
02:43:15,092 --> 02:43:19,816
[SPEAKER_29]: And so I would hesitate to say I make that decision because it would have to be approved.

2044
02:43:19,836 --> 02:43:23,059
[SPEAKER_22]: So someone from the city is going to say, okay, you know what?

2045
02:43:23,519 --> 02:43:26,642
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to opt in as 6% renewable energy.

2046
02:43:26,842 --> 02:43:27,783
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's, that's great.

2047
02:43:27,863 --> 02:43:29,184
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a, it's a worthy cause.

2048
02:43:29,904 --> 02:43:31,606
[SPEAKER_22]: I get my bill and I said, wow,

2049
02:43:32,813 --> 02:43:33,953
[SPEAKER_22]: What's the extra cost here?

2050
02:43:34,073 --> 02:43:34,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, renewable energy.

2051
02:43:35,473 --> 02:43:38,074
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to now opt out of that, right?

2052
02:43:38,754 --> 02:43:45,075
[SPEAKER_22]: Once I'm opted in, then I have to opt out of that portion from what you stated earlier, which is another step.

2053
02:43:45,095 --> 02:43:52,377
[SPEAKER_29]: The amount we're looking at is looking at would be two-tenths of a penny per kilowatt hour.

2054
02:43:53,037 --> 02:43:56,357
[SPEAKER_29]: I find it unlikely that any- I don't think you understand.

2055
02:43:56,377 --> 02:44:00,098
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the question is, residents should have the right to determine

2056
02:44:00,629 --> 02:44:06,173
[SPEAKER_22]: Because right now, I could determine, when I get my bill, it says, do you want to have a portion of it for renewable energy?

2057
02:44:06,854 --> 02:44:08,154
[SPEAKER_22]: And I make that determination.

2058
02:44:09,055 --> 02:44:10,696
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want you making that determination.

2059
02:44:11,257 --> 02:44:15,580
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want some bureaucrat here at City Hall making that determination, with all due respect.

2060
02:44:16,280 --> 02:44:18,122
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's what you're saying is going to be done right now.

2061
02:44:18,422 --> 02:44:25,927
[SPEAKER_22]: So whether it's a penny or a small amount or this or that, I just fundamentally, I just have a problem with this.

2062
02:44:25,987 --> 02:44:29,610
[SPEAKER_22]: If people want to go out in the open market, and if the city wants to assist,

2063
02:44:31,869 --> 02:44:38,374
[SPEAKER_22]: and trying to get as many people as possible in this city to join those other communities, then I'm sure they'll take us on.

2064
02:44:38,754 --> 02:44:40,015
[SPEAKER_22]: Fine, let it go that way.

2065
02:44:40,996 --> 02:44:43,738
[SPEAKER_29]: They won't take us as an opt-on.

2066
02:44:44,038 --> 02:44:46,400
[SPEAKER_29]: They will not agree with that as part of the plan.

2067
02:44:46,460 --> 02:44:47,921
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, we don't know.

2068
02:44:48,081 --> 02:44:49,943
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe the state legislature can create a new law.

2069
02:44:51,304 --> 02:44:54,586
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, there's just too many what-ifs on this.

2070
02:44:55,167 --> 02:44:59,170
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm not going to be one that's going to tell the homeowner

2071
02:44:59,517 --> 02:45:02,678
[SPEAKER_22]: that all of a sudden now you have to use this supplier.

2072
02:45:03,458 --> 02:45:07,199
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're going to have a set of eyes on it, whether it's a consultant or someone at City Hall.

2073
02:45:07,559 --> 02:45:09,440
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're going to try to save you as much as possible.

2074
02:45:09,680 --> 02:45:14,201
[SPEAKER_22]: And like Councilor Caviello said, if things go wrong, who are they going to point the finger to, Alicia Hunt?

2075
02:45:14,221 --> 02:45:17,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Or are they going to call the council and say, why the hell did you vote on that?

2076
02:45:17,502 --> 02:45:19,262
[SPEAKER_22]: My bill is more than it was last year.

2077
02:45:20,323 --> 02:45:21,783
[SPEAKER_22]: Who are you to get into my business?

2078
02:45:22,243 --> 02:45:23,343
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what's going to happen.

2079
02:45:23,924 --> 02:45:24,704
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what's going to happen.

2080
02:45:24,724 --> 02:45:26,984
[SPEAKER_22]: And ultimately, I have a problem with this.

2081
02:45:27,024 --> 02:45:28,385
[SPEAKER_22]: So you're not going to get my vote.

2082
02:45:28,405 --> 02:45:29,365
[SPEAKER_22]: I told you this last week.

2083
02:45:29,672 --> 02:45:31,193
[SPEAKER_22]: So this shouldn't be a surprise to you.

2084
02:45:31,293 --> 02:45:32,554
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not going to get my vote on this.

2085
02:45:34,194 --> 02:45:47,702
[SPEAKER_22]: If you came with some facts and figures on what it's going to cost for time, staffing, consultants, and then determine what the savings is and compare that, compare to what it's going to cost us in our budget to run this, then maybe I'd take a look at it.

2086
02:45:48,002 --> 02:45:49,502
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm not going to do that after the fact.

2087
02:45:49,823 --> 02:45:54,705
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not going to let the horse go down the street and say, well, now we're going to determine.

2088
02:45:55,346 --> 02:45:55,966
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know.

2089
02:45:57,691 --> 02:46:00,392
[SPEAKER_22]: Not gonna get my support tonight, but I wish you well on it.

2090
02:46:00,832 --> 02:46:08,815
[SPEAKER_29]: So I appreciate your candor, and I will repeat that there is no cost to the budget, and there will not be, there would also be no revenue in this to the city.

2091
02:46:09,235 --> 02:46:15,418
[SPEAKER_29]: So this is a benefit only to the residents and small businesses, and not a financial benefit or cost to the city.

2092
02:46:15,438 --> 02:46:21,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Alicia, if you take five minutes out of your day to do something regarding this program, that's a cost to the city and a cost to the budget.

2093
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:24,201
[SPEAKER_22]: And you've already spent numerous time on this already.

2094
02:46:24,581 --> 02:46:26,262
[SPEAKER_22]: So to say there's no cost to the budget,

2095
02:46:26,655 --> 02:46:29,838
[SPEAKER_22]: is being naive, to say the least.

2096
02:46:30,478 --> 02:46:32,280
[SPEAKER_22]: There is a cost in the budget.

2097
02:46:32,300 --> 02:46:38,224
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a cost of doing business, and there's a cost for consultants, and every other underlying issue in here.

2098
02:46:38,445 --> 02:46:39,946
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a cost for renewable energy.

2099
02:46:40,246 --> 02:46:42,047
[SPEAKER_22]: You may want to do renewable energy.

2100
02:46:42,308 --> 02:46:46,151
[SPEAKER_22]: My mother, who can't afford to do it, may not want to do renewable energy.

2101
02:46:47,552 --> 02:46:49,674
[SPEAKER_22]: And she shouldn't have to opt out every time.

2102
02:46:49,714 --> 02:46:50,514
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to opt out of this.

2103
02:46:50,534 --> 02:46:51,295
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to opt out of this.

2104
02:46:51,749 --> 02:46:53,429
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, because we know what's going to happen.

2105
02:46:53,489 --> 02:46:54,670
[SPEAKER_22]: Residents aren't going to opt out.

2106
02:46:55,110 --> 02:46:55,550
[SPEAKER_22]: We know it.

2107
02:46:56,030 --> 02:46:57,090
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, let's face it.

2108
02:46:58,050 --> 02:46:58,470
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's face it.

2109
02:46:58,490 --> 02:46:59,270
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what's going to happen.

2110
02:46:59,310 --> 02:47:01,751
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why the state legislature created the way they did.

2111
02:47:02,051 --> 02:47:03,291
[SPEAKER_22]: You opted in automatically.

2112
02:47:03,611 --> 02:47:04,871
[SPEAKER_22]: What a crazy idea that is.

2113
02:47:05,832 --> 02:47:06,452
[SPEAKER_22]: Opt everyone in.

2114
02:47:07,232 --> 02:47:08,192
[SPEAKER_22]: But I thank you for your time.

2115
02:47:14,293 --> 02:47:14,613
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2116
02:47:14,653 --> 02:47:17,114
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2117
02:47:17,134 --> 02:47:18,514
[SPEAKER_20]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

2118
02:47:19,702 --> 02:47:28,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I think it's rather clear, based upon the tenor and tone of the discussions that we've had this evening, that we're not going to be able to make a decision as to whether or not this is a matter that should go forward.

2119
02:47:28,725 --> 02:47:32,366
[SPEAKER_16]: And as such, I would recommend to make a motion that the matter be tabled.

2120
02:47:32,386 --> 02:47:34,247
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion to table by Councillor Knight.

2121
02:47:35,407 --> 02:47:36,387
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

2122
02:47:36,667 --> 02:47:38,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I withdraw my motion to table.

2123
02:47:39,168 --> 02:47:40,389
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion is withdrawn.

2124
02:47:40,809 --> 02:47:43,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes Vice President Langel-Kern.

2125
02:47:43,330 --> 02:47:45,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree that's probably the best thing to do.

2126
02:47:45,370 --> 02:47:47,751
[SPEAKER_10]: But my suggestion would be, if it

2127
02:47:48,172 --> 02:47:49,873
[SPEAKER_10]: tabled and it can come up again.

2128
02:47:49,893 --> 02:48:00,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I would ask that you look into a public comment period, whether that be, not necessarily a public hearing, but some way that residents can voice their opinions on this to give us some feedback.

2129
02:48:01,363 --> 02:48:07,888
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd be happy to put out a survey online that people could fill in whether they'd be interested in such a thing.

2130
02:48:08,309 --> 02:48:13,273
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know how much of a response we'd get to something like that or ask people to send

2131
02:48:14,179 --> 02:48:15,679
[SPEAKER_29]: you email or me email?

2132
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:19,120
[SPEAKER_29]: I certainly am not encouraging residents to email their counselors.

2133
02:48:19,540 --> 02:48:19,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2134
02:48:20,641 --> 02:48:26,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think something that should be discussed tonight, but maybe that would be something that would help the council in deciding on their vote.

2135
02:48:26,462 --> 02:48:28,182
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love the input from our residents.

2136
02:48:28,542 --> 02:48:31,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, cause I think my vote is, I'm not ready to vote on this tonight.

2137
02:48:32,063 --> 02:48:38,625
[SPEAKER_10]: So I agree to take, um, counseling nights, motion table, but I'm just, I'm just giving a suggestion to try to hook a few people.

2138
02:48:38,765 --> 02:48:39,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

2139
02:48:40,605 --> 02:48:42,826
[SPEAKER_29]: If there were other questions that we could answer,

2140
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:47,101
[SPEAKER_29]: Other than that, I mean, to further inform you.

2141
02:48:49,261 --> 02:48:50,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

2142
02:48:50,622 --> 02:48:54,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I don't think that it would be harmful either if I'm in part of the motions table.

2143
02:48:54,483 --> 02:49:00,884
[SPEAKER_16]: We also put a referral maybe to the subcommittee on energy and environment for further investigation.

2144
02:49:00,904 --> 02:49:06,846
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2145
02:49:07,706 --> 02:49:08,766
[SPEAKER_19]: He withdrew it already.

2146
02:49:08,786 --> 02:49:12,167
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to let some residents speak if you would.

2147
02:49:13,789 --> 02:49:15,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2148
02:49:15,870 --> 02:49:16,950
[SPEAKER_25]: Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

2149
02:49:17,390 --> 02:49:18,770
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do appreciate Ms.

2150
02:49:18,810 --> 02:49:20,571
[SPEAKER_25]: Hunt and all the work that she does.

2151
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:26,212
[SPEAKER_25]: And if I can, if they make it affordable, I'll put solar panels on my roof.

2152
02:49:26,372 --> 02:49:31,194
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd be the first one to talk to her if I was going to put solar panels on my roof or do something like that.

2153
02:49:32,794 --> 02:49:35,055
[SPEAKER_25]: But the government is in my life too much as it is.

2154
02:49:35,995 --> 02:49:37,235
[SPEAKER_25]: Believe me, they're in my life.

2155
02:49:37,956 --> 02:49:43,117
[SPEAKER_25]: And the CPA has required me now

2156
02:49:43,883 --> 02:49:48,884
[SPEAKER_25]: I had to go and get the exemption for low income, and I had to present my birth certificate.

2157
02:49:48,904 --> 02:49:50,704
[SPEAKER_25]: I had to present my tax return.

2158
02:49:50,824 --> 02:49:56,325
[SPEAKER_25]: I had to present, which I never had to do, just for this one little thing in the city, just for this one little thing.

2159
02:49:56,766 --> 02:49:58,526
[SPEAKER_25]: I had my tax return.

2160
02:49:58,646 --> 02:50:00,906
[SPEAKER_25]: I had to put in—I get rental income.

2161
02:50:01,527 --> 02:50:03,947
[SPEAKER_25]: They never had to know what my rental income was.

2162
02:50:04,027 --> 02:50:04,807
[SPEAKER_25]: Not that I care.

2163
02:50:05,227 --> 02:50:06,548
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't overcharge my tenant.

2164
02:50:06,708 --> 02:50:07,748
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, I undercharge him.

2165
02:50:08,268 --> 02:50:09,008
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not the point.

2166
02:50:09,483 --> 02:50:13,006
[SPEAKER_25]: It's nobody's business if I charge them $1,200 or $2,200.

2167
02:50:13,046 --> 02:50:14,026
[SPEAKER_25]: It shouldn't be their business.

2168
02:50:14,327 --> 02:50:24,374
[SPEAKER_25]: But it is now because for the first time, I have to give this information out to the city just for my taxes.

2169
02:50:24,834 --> 02:50:28,337
[SPEAKER_25]: And I mean, everybody knows everything about my economic status.

2170
02:50:28,437 --> 02:50:29,378
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, it's not news.

2171
02:50:29,858 --> 02:50:31,519
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's an invasion of privacy.

2172
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:33,961
[SPEAKER_25]: And back to the city and how they do business.

2173
02:50:34,362 --> 02:50:37,464
[SPEAKER_25]: The water and sewer business is what you're in.

2174
02:50:37,813 --> 02:50:43,158
[SPEAKER_25]: which is a commodity or it's a mandated thing, the water and sewer.

2175
02:50:43,599 --> 02:50:47,703
[SPEAKER_25]: And look at the situation that the city is in with water and sewer.

2176
02:50:48,363 --> 02:51:00,707
[SPEAKER_25]: And that is a, and I'm not against the saving money and the electricity and all of that, but we don't need one more layer of bureaucracy in this city for the reasons that Mr. Carviello pointed out.

2177
02:51:01,268 --> 02:51:10,031
[SPEAKER_25]: And, um, the water and sewer pipes need replacement and we can't demand from the government that they get replaced under the ground.

2178
02:51:11,271 --> 02:51:13,132
[SPEAKER_25]: We can't, we can't get them to move on that.

2179
02:51:13,352 --> 02:51:16,833
[SPEAKER_25]: We can't get the city government to run properly now.

2180
02:51:17,345 --> 02:51:24,812
[SPEAKER_25]: whether it's a fire department, police department, there's a lot of areas that are insufficient in the city government now, especially water and sewer.

2181
02:51:24,852 --> 02:51:29,657
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's comparable to what this issue is, which is electricity.

2182
02:51:29,984 --> 02:51:32,685
[SPEAKER_25]: which is something you need in your house right now.

2183
02:51:33,405 --> 02:51:41,329
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm all for, if I can afford to put solar panels on my house and go, you know, renewable, all the more power to me, right?

2184
02:51:41,849 --> 02:51:42,369
[SPEAKER_25]: That's awesome.

2185
02:51:42,729 --> 02:51:44,650
[SPEAKER_25]: There's other also complexities.

2186
02:51:45,190 --> 02:51:51,953
[SPEAKER_25]: At one point, I needed National Grid to give me a cut in my electric bill because my income was low.

2187
02:51:52,454 --> 02:51:55,356
[SPEAKER_25]: before I got my disability check.

2188
02:51:55,916 --> 02:51:57,577
[SPEAKER_25]: So I needed that extra money.

2189
02:51:57,678 --> 02:51:58,498
[SPEAKER_25]: So that was another thing.

2190
02:51:58,538 --> 02:52:03,361
[SPEAKER_25]: I had to go to the National Grid and I got a break in my electric bill when I had a very, very low income.

2191
02:52:04,042 --> 02:52:09,806
[SPEAKER_25]: So would I be able to negotiate that with the new provider or whatever?

2192
02:52:10,306 --> 02:52:11,587
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just too complicated.

2193
02:52:12,531 --> 02:52:17,172
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's just one more layer of the local government.

2194
02:52:17,232 --> 02:52:19,693
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, I want her to work here.

2195
02:52:19,753 --> 02:52:25,214
[SPEAKER_25]: I want her to save money for the city and put up solar panels and wind farms if it's doable.

2196
02:52:25,534 --> 02:52:32,416
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, the wind farms should be going towards putting this city electric bill on wind farms and on solar.

2197
02:52:32,776 --> 02:52:35,157
[SPEAKER_25]: More power to her if she can figure out a way to do it.

2198
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:37,040
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what she should be doing.

2199
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:43,322
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I just think that there's enough government in my life.

2200
02:52:43,482 --> 02:52:44,782
[SPEAKER_25]: Trust me on this.

2201
02:52:45,242 --> 02:52:46,322
[SPEAKER_25]: I live inside the government.

2202
02:52:46,342 --> 02:52:47,602
[SPEAKER_25]: The government lives inside my head.

2203
02:52:48,142 --> 02:52:50,003
[SPEAKER_25]: So we get enough of that going.

2204
02:52:50,383 --> 02:52:51,483
[SPEAKER_25]: So anyway, thank you for listening.

2205
02:52:51,623 --> 02:52:51,883
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye-bye.

2206
02:52:54,524 --> 02:52:55,064
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address.

2207
02:52:56,024 --> 02:52:57,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Longo-Kern.

2208
02:52:57,904 --> 02:52:59,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

2209
02:53:02,492 --> 02:53:07,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say really briefly, I really enjoy saying President Lungo Kern.

2210
02:53:07,816 --> 02:53:10,397
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a great thing for this body.

2211
02:53:10,838 --> 02:53:11,818
[SPEAKER_03]: But I digress.

2212
02:53:12,419 --> 02:53:13,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this matter going to be tabled?

2213
02:53:18,503 --> 02:53:19,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.

2214
02:53:19,304 --> 02:53:21,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we're going to have that offering, yes.

2215
02:53:21,525 --> 02:53:22,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confused.

2216
02:53:22,426 --> 02:53:31,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all through this discussion, a couple of things came to my mind that Ronald Reagan often said.

2217
02:53:32,310 --> 02:53:35,112
[SPEAKER_03]: as scary as nine words, I'm here from the government and I'm here to help.

2218
02:53:36,293 --> 02:53:39,736
[SPEAKER_03]: And the government that governs least is the government that governs best.

2219
02:53:40,937 --> 02:53:49,063
[SPEAKER_03]: President Longo-Kern, what Councilor Marks said tonight was 1,000% spot on.

2220
02:53:49,083 --> 02:53:54,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the vote should be taken and this should be voted down.

2221
02:53:55,988 --> 02:53:56,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confused.

2222
02:53:59,410 --> 02:53:59,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

2223
02:53:59,651 --> 02:54:01,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Hunt said to

2224
02:54:02,088 --> 02:54:15,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello that she wouldn't want to have a public hearing on a theoretical proposition, but they want to have the vote tonight on a solid proposal.

2225
02:54:16,316 --> 02:54:22,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't understand how it changes from a solid proposal to the city council to take a vote.

2226
02:54:22,878 --> 02:54:28,662
[SPEAKER_03]: to a theoretical proposition to the citizens that are suffering, do as I say, not as I do.

2227
02:54:29,923 --> 02:54:31,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really confused on that.

2228
02:54:32,405 --> 02:54:37,648
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that possible, that for the residents, it's a theoretical proposition?

2229
02:54:38,108 --> 02:54:44,673
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's an ironclad proposal here tonight that's going to bind the residents of Medford Inn.

2230
02:54:44,713 --> 02:54:46,975
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I asked President Longo-Kern.

2231
02:54:48,049 --> 02:54:54,554
[SPEAKER_03]: this was going to be tabled, because if it's going to be tabled, then my point is moot.

2232
02:54:54,634 --> 02:55:05,763
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really think this should be voted down, unless the city's going to get in on it, too, like Councilor Marks said.

2233
02:55:06,463 --> 02:55:17,892
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the residents of this city need to have 1,000 questions, all sorts of input.

2234
02:55:18,288 --> 02:55:24,109
[SPEAKER_03]: since, you know, they're being basically forced into something.

2235
02:55:24,209 --> 02:55:25,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President.

2236
02:55:25,770 --> 02:55:27,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Kouchi.

2237
02:55:30,090 --> 02:55:34,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Ladies and gentlemen of the council, Dave Champey, 35 Greenhall Street, Medford.

2238
02:55:38,432 --> 02:55:46,974
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole thing, the item number request, I don't know if you people read the last line, and authorize the mayor.

2239
02:55:48,681 --> 02:55:52,164
[SPEAKER_09]: to execute all documents necessary to accomplish the same.

2240
02:55:54,045 --> 02:55:55,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like republic parking all over again.

2241
02:55:58,669 --> 02:56:12,259
[SPEAKER_09]: And tell you the truth, if I'm opted in, well, the city goes for this, I'm opted in, I opt out because national grid basically does have a better rate over the long run than good energy.

2242
02:56:14,165 --> 02:56:23,591
[SPEAKER_09]: and I have to go into default payment plan with National Grid because I was out, then I opted back in, who's going to cover that?

2243
02:56:25,632 --> 02:56:26,793
[SPEAKER_09]: City of Method going to cover that?

2244
02:56:28,514 --> 02:56:31,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Unwilling participant forced into something by the city government.

2245
02:56:32,556 --> 02:56:34,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to suffer financial loss.

2246
02:56:36,718 --> 02:56:41,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, if you go and, you know, the consultant, oh, the consultant is going to get $100,000.

2247
02:56:43,761 --> 02:56:47,822
[SPEAKER_09]: 0.1, what is it, a tenth of a percent per kilowatt hour?

2248
02:56:54,564 --> 02:56:57,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what is it?

2249
02:56:57,324 --> 02:56:57,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Through the chair.

2250
02:56:57,904 --> 02:57:03,106
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a thousandth of a dollar.

2251
02:57:03,606 --> 02:57:04,946
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a thousandth of a dollar.

2252
02:57:05,686 --> 02:57:06,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Per kilowatt hour.

2253
02:57:08,267 --> 02:57:08,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Tenth of a penny.

2254
02:57:09,567 --> 02:57:09,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2255
02:57:15,009 --> 02:57:19,572
[SPEAKER_09]: So this consultant isn't going to be just a consultant for the city of Medford.

2256
02:57:19,612 --> 02:57:40,583
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a compilation and the consultant is going to come from metropolitan area planning council, which was when it was created, a bureau for retired hacks, political consultants and anybody else that needed a job.

2257
02:57:41,884 --> 02:57:42,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I've worked with them.

2258
02:57:43,870 --> 02:57:46,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I've written grants for them.

2259
02:57:49,995 --> 02:58:03,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe this is a good plan for the city of Medford, especially if people are going to get screwed and be forced to pay a higher rate because the city thinks it's a better plan.

2260
02:58:04,047 --> 02:58:06,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we know how this, is that going to be like the water account?

2261
02:58:08,491 --> 02:58:11,974
[SPEAKER_09]: We're paying so much, you know, one year we have a budget

2262
02:58:12,838 --> 02:58:18,883
[SPEAKER_09]: surplus, and next year we have a deficit, and meanwhile we've got, what, eight, nine million dollars sitting in the fund.

2263
02:58:19,704 --> 02:58:27,270
[SPEAKER_09]: How can you have a deficit one year and, you know, this is ridiculous.

2264
02:58:28,111 --> 02:58:37,698
[SPEAKER_09]: People have got to come up with a system better than this, and like I said, the last line, and authorize the mayor to execute all documents necessary to accomplish the same.

2265
02:58:40,208 --> 02:58:44,410
[SPEAKER_09]: If you vote yes on this tonight, you're basically telling the mayor, go ahead.

2266
02:58:46,991 --> 02:58:47,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Been advised.

2267
02:58:47,632 --> 02:58:48,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Republic.

2268
02:58:49,012 --> 02:58:49,993
[SPEAKER_09]: You've given us a great example.

2269
02:58:50,433 --> 02:58:50,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

2270
02:58:51,153 --> 02:58:52,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table, Madam President.

2271
02:58:55,975 --> 02:58:56,356
[SPEAKER_16]: One more?

2272
02:58:57,156 --> 02:58:58,977
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we're all going to vote to table this thing.

2273
02:59:00,297 --> 02:59:04,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. President, Madam President, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.

2274
02:59:06,861 --> 02:59:07,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to withdraw.

2275
02:59:08,341 --> 02:59:08,781
[SPEAKER_00]: My motion.

2276
02:59:08,802 --> 02:59:09,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to table.

2277
02:59:09,482 --> 02:59:09,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2278
02:59:10,397 --> 02:59:12,438
[SPEAKER_00]: I can appreciate the idea that Ms.

2279
02:59:12,458 --> 02:59:21,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunt and the Energy Office has brought before the council, but I don't think her tenure here has been long enough to understand what the citizens of our community have expected.

2280
02:59:21,563 --> 02:59:24,464
[SPEAKER_00]: We can digress and go back a few years and talk about Stations Landing.

2281
02:59:25,024 --> 02:59:35,150
[SPEAKER_00]: When Stations Landing was coming here into the city of Medford, people, or we were told, that that would be the new panacea of no new growth in this community or a stability in growth.

2282
02:59:35,710 --> 02:59:37,811
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've all seen what's happened since that point in time.

2283
02:59:38,333 --> 02:59:44,615
[SPEAKER_00]: The taxes have gone up each and every year while we've collected well in excess of a million and a half new dollars each and every year from there.

2284
02:59:45,395 --> 02:59:49,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next argument could possibly be the banks here in the City of Meffitt.

2285
02:59:49,757 --> 02:59:57,039
[SPEAKER_00]: The City of Meffitt goes out on a daily basis to get the best possible rate on interest rates for the money that they deposit.

2286
02:59:57,880 --> 03:00:04,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the City of Meffitt going to go out of its way now to tell the taxpayers of this community to go to a particular bank that they go to?

2287
03:00:05,222 --> 03:00:08,263
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more people that go to that bank, they're going to get a better interest rate?

2288
03:00:08,863 --> 03:00:12,804
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're getting a good interest rate, which is better than the bank that you're going to.

2289
03:00:13,644 --> 03:00:15,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the insurance company.

2290
03:00:15,525 --> 03:00:16,665
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to buy our insurance.

2291
03:00:16,685 --> 03:00:17,925
[SPEAKER_00]: We go out and we get the best bid.

2292
03:00:18,345 --> 03:00:23,227
[SPEAKER_00]: The best bid will probably be less than the bid that you, Mr. and Mrs. Meffitt, possibly might be getting.

2293
03:00:23,647 --> 03:00:24,127
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

2294
03:00:24,747 --> 03:00:28,508
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mr. Champ, you just brought up a very interesting point when you talked about water and sewer.

2295
03:00:29,448 --> 03:00:33,069
[SPEAKER_00]: You folks have in your budget right now in excess of a $400,000 deficit or a debt on the water

2296
03:00:36,389 --> 03:00:38,290
[SPEAKER_00]: and the suicide from the city and the school committee.

2297
03:00:39,331 --> 03:00:40,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Why isn't the city paying for that?

2298
03:00:41,272 --> 03:00:54,081
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, they're so concerned about your electric bill, but they're not concerned about the $400,000 that every single taxpayer in this city is paying for because the school department in the city side won't account for their own water.

2299
03:00:54,682 --> 03:00:57,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, you people will pass that when the budget comes.

2300
03:00:58,284 --> 03:01:02,267
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you talk about the state legislature passing these laws, and I think you're right, Councilman Marks.

2301
03:01:02,307 --> 03:01:03,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they got this upside down.

2302
03:01:04,682 --> 03:01:06,194
[SPEAKER_00]: opting in rather than opting out.

2303
03:01:07,082 --> 03:01:25,229
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way a community or a city can operate, when they talk to their taxpayers, when they have better communication, but when they don't have good communication, and the only public forum that they have is this council, and the rail here at this council that they can come up and talk, then that's what the conversation should be about.

2304
03:01:25,769 --> 03:01:34,172
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be talking about taking a vote which mandates somebody that they have to join, and then they might have to figure out when, within 180 days, have to opt out.

2305
03:01:35,953 --> 03:01:37,114
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the right way to go.

2306
03:01:37,634 --> 03:02:00,623
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're going to expend municipal time through its employees on projects on behalf of every single taxpayer in this community, then why are you mandating it rather than making it voluntarily so you could show them this is a better way for you, Mr. and Mrs. Medford, to save money rather than be at the option of April or October to a $100,000 consultant

2307
03:02:02,712 --> 03:02:14,936
[SPEAKER_00]: who was going to be making money trying to tell the city of Medford who might, on a particular day, get the best possible rate, and who might not get that best possible rate during that period of time, but the consultant still makes his money.

2308
03:02:15,556 --> 03:02:16,937
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this is a good idea.

2309
03:02:17,297 --> 03:02:24,600
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are more important things to do here in the city of Medford, and I would hope that this Medford City Council does not entertain this particular matter.

2310
03:02:24,820 --> 03:02:25,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2311
03:02:26,100 --> 03:02:26,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2312
03:02:26,520 --> 03:02:31,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address, please.

2313
03:02:33,293 --> 03:02:37,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Andrew Castanetti, Method, Massachusetts.

2314
03:02:39,175 --> 03:02:39,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2315
03:02:39,615 --> 03:02:44,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get mad at me, but you're the prettiest VP, Vice President I've seen today.

2316
03:02:44,716 --> 03:02:45,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2317
03:02:45,957 --> 03:03:01,801
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, I want to thank Mrs. Alicia Hunt for performing her job and trying or implying to save us the residential

2318
03:03:04,470 --> 03:03:12,335
[SPEAKER_08]: electric payers some money on their bills, hopefully, if it ever goes through there.

2319
03:03:12,715 --> 03:03:30,125
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I know what I pay for my supply service side of the electric bill from National Grid on Cushing Street, and that rate is X amount of cents per kilowatt hour.

2320
03:03:34,383 --> 03:03:39,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Coincidentally, direct energy, I'm sorry, you didn't get that?

2321
03:03:42,049 --> 03:03:46,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm paying X amounts cents per kilowatt hour.

2322
03:03:47,012 --> 03:03:49,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I left it blank on purpose.

2323
03:03:49,094 --> 03:03:49,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2324
03:03:49,914 --> 03:03:50,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for paying attention.

2325
03:03:53,357 --> 03:04:04,105
[SPEAKER_08]: So coincidentally, direct energy knocked on my door and I actually gave them half hour of my time this time instead of zero time.

2326
03:04:05,082 --> 03:04:10,186
[SPEAKER_08]: And they gave me a contract just to use and read, but he didn't want me to keep it.

2327
03:04:10,706 --> 03:04:11,627
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is it.

2328
03:04:13,888 --> 03:04:17,551
[SPEAKER_08]: He came back later, and I compared it to what he offered.

2329
03:04:17,591 --> 03:04:21,054
[SPEAKER_08]: He offered X amount of cents less than what I'm paying.

2330
03:04:22,155 --> 03:04:26,978
[SPEAKER_08]: And much to my chagrin, he told me a lot of my neighbors are paying less than I am.

2331
03:04:28,279 --> 03:04:29,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did not know that.

2332
03:04:31,081 --> 03:04:33,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So I presume some people are paying

2333
03:04:34,583 --> 03:04:35,503
[SPEAKER_08]: even more than I am.

2334
03:04:36,024 --> 03:04:41,725
[SPEAKER_08]: That sort of tells me that there is no set rate, I guess, period.

2335
03:04:42,446 --> 03:04:43,546
[SPEAKER_08]: It could vary.

2336
03:04:44,186 --> 03:04:46,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure how much it could fluctuate.

2337
03:04:47,707 --> 03:05:01,432
[SPEAKER_08]: So through the chair, I never did hear what the cost would be, presently speaking, or through Alicia's energy connections in her department.

2338
03:05:02,677 --> 03:05:08,641
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the latest rate that you heard of per kilowatt hours on the supply side?

2339
03:05:09,181 --> 03:05:10,122
[SPEAKER_08]: No one would I pay.

2340
03:05:10,642 --> 03:05:17,506
[SPEAKER_08]: And people out there that may be in the audience listening, that they may go home and check their bill, see what they're paying.

2341
03:05:17,807 --> 03:05:19,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you please answer me for the chair?

2342
03:05:19,908 --> 03:05:20,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Good question.

2343
03:05:21,649 --> 03:05:25,592
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the kilowatt hour rate, the latest that you know of?

2344
03:05:25,652 --> 03:05:26,392
[SPEAKER_10]: With good energy.

2345
03:05:26,412 --> 03:05:30,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you understand the question?

2346
03:05:30,355 --> 03:05:32,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you understand the question?

2347
03:05:34,538 --> 03:05:40,540
[SPEAKER_29]: So just to be clear, we would go out to bid in November and we would get a rate given to us then.

2348
03:05:40,760 --> 03:05:48,424
[SPEAKER_29]: So we can't guarantee that, but we do know what rate Melrose got last year for their aggregation.

2349
03:05:48,724 --> 03:05:50,604
[SPEAKER_29]: I had it, but I don't have it in front of me.

2350
03:05:50,664 --> 03:05:52,685
[SPEAKER_29]: Patrick knows the rates Melrose has.

2351
03:05:53,186 --> 03:05:58,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think Melrose has a rate of 9.6 cents and the other

2352
03:05:59,738 --> 03:06:01,900
[SPEAKER_06]: three communities that Good Energy has got a rate of 9.4.

2353
03:06:02,480 --> 03:06:05,162
[SPEAKER_06]: They contracted for different term lengths.

2354
03:06:07,224 --> 03:06:10,106
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, from the chair then, and what is National Grid?

2355
03:06:10,287 --> 03:06:11,267
[SPEAKER_10]: So what is the savings?

2356
03:06:12,268 --> 03:06:18,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So National Grid's winter rate was, gosh, I think it was about 11 cents.

2357
03:06:19,214 --> 03:06:20,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have it on my list.

2358
03:06:21,905 --> 03:06:22,105
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

2359
03:06:22,185 --> 03:06:28,127
[SPEAKER_29]: So just to be clear, there was a rate, um, national grid had a rate in the winter time and that rate.

2360
03:06:28,207 --> 03:06:34,389
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you look at your bill, November through, uh, April, you'll see one rate.

2361
03:06:34,549 --> 03:06:38,011
[SPEAKER_29]: And then I think it's may through October, you'll see another rate.

2362
03:06:38,831 --> 03:06:47,474
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I know that their amount was much better than the winter rate and may not have beat the new summer rate.

2363
03:06:47,494 --> 03:06:47,974
[SPEAKER_29]: Gotcha.

2364
03:06:47,994 --> 03:06:48,214
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

2365
03:06:48,874 --> 03:06:49,494
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much.

2366
03:06:50,335 --> 03:06:50,595
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2367
03:06:50,615 --> 03:06:50,975
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2368
03:06:51,396 --> 03:06:53,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Mrs. Hunt.

2369
03:06:57,378 --> 03:07:11,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, direct energy offered me 0.09 cents, which is, as they would say, two-tenths of a cent less than what the latest one in Melrose was.

2370
03:07:11,964 --> 03:07:20,587
[SPEAKER_08]: So direct energy, I believe, is two-tenths of a cent cheaper per kilowatt hour on the supply service charge.

2371
03:07:22,876 --> 03:07:31,662
[SPEAKER_08]: If I took this offer from direct energy, if it's still available today, from May 30th, I'd be saving 16%, and that would always be 16%.

2372
03:07:32,883 --> 03:07:36,046
[SPEAKER_08]: For one full year thereafter, there is no guarantee in life.

2373
03:07:37,727 --> 03:07:39,008
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the market rate would be.

2374
03:07:39,548 --> 03:07:51,277
[SPEAKER_08]: If someone brought up solar energy, if I may go off course, but stay on the grid of solar energy, this is from a method transcript

2375
03:07:51,868 --> 03:07:52,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe.

2376
03:07:55,289 --> 03:07:59,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a picture of Senator Patricia G. Holland.

2377
03:08:01,271 --> 03:08:02,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Jalen, thank you.

2378
03:08:04,812 --> 03:08:11,414
[SPEAKER_08]: She was among one of those who voted to pass the solar energy bill signed into law by the governor on April 11.

2379
03:08:11,454 --> 03:08:13,355
[SPEAKER_08]: This is in the transcript on April 28, 2016.

2380
03:08:20,762 --> 03:08:29,167
[SPEAKER_08]: And in a nutshell, it says, legislature passes solar energy bill, lifting the net metering cap.

2381
03:08:30,188 --> 03:08:38,193
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first paragraph I'll only read, the Massachusetts legislator recently passed legislation that raises the solar net metering cap.

2382
03:08:38,793 --> 03:08:48,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Net metering allows consumers, businesses, and municipalities to produce solar power and feed it back into the electric grid

2383
03:08:49,622 --> 03:08:51,843
[SPEAKER_08]: for discounts on electric expenses.

2384
03:08:52,344 --> 03:09:09,193
[SPEAKER_08]: The legislator raises the net metering cap 3 percent for private facilities and 3 percent for public facilities, which will allow solar projects currently in the development pipeline to move forward.

2385
03:09:09,213 --> 03:09:17,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it is an incentive of sorts to get these projects more off the oil addiction, as Mr. Bush would say.

2386
03:09:19,585 --> 03:09:28,151
[SPEAKER_08]: My point or question is, if the state really cared about us, they wouldn't have any cap whatsoever.

2387
03:09:28,852 --> 03:09:33,335
[SPEAKER_08]: And we could sell it all back to the electric company and tell them to get a real job instead.

2388
03:09:34,315 --> 03:09:35,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for listening.

2389
03:09:35,176 --> 03:09:35,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2390
03:09:35,516 --> 03:09:37,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to table.

2391
03:09:37,998 --> 03:09:39,259
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

2392
03:09:39,899 --> 03:09:39,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

2393
03:09:40,940 --> 03:09:41,560
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

2394
03:09:42,321 --> 03:09:43,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Papers tabled.

2395
03:09:44,783 --> 03:09:45,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilman.

2396
03:09:46,072 --> 03:09:49,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Paper 16-537 offered by Councilor Scott Pelley.

2397
03:09:52,056 --> 03:10:03,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Be resolved that the DPW Director or Energy City Engineer report back to the City Council on what type of patching material must be used when utility companies perform work on our city streets and roads.

2398
03:10:04,283 --> 03:10:05,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

2399
03:10:05,183 --> 03:10:05,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2400
03:10:05,583 --> 03:10:07,104
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can, can you tie in the second one?

2401
03:10:07,505 --> 03:10:07,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

2402
03:10:07,845 --> 03:10:09,806
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can, I should have put it together.

2403
03:10:09,986 --> 03:10:11,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do them together.

2404
03:10:11,627 --> 03:10:13,408
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-536 offered by Councilor Scott Pelley.

2405
03:10:13,812 --> 03:10:24,440
[SPEAKER_10]: be it resolved that the city engineer report back to the Medford City Council with guidelines dealing with hours of operations for patching streets from work performed by utility companies.

2406
03:10:24,981 --> 03:10:25,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor Scafelli.

2407
03:10:25,801 --> 03:10:27,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

2408
03:10:28,463 --> 03:10:41,974
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can, I know it's been a long day and night for us, but I'm getting a little concerned and upset with our public utility companies that are coming into our community.

2409
03:10:42,588 --> 03:10:48,350
[SPEAKER_02]: and understanding when the hours of operations.

2410
03:10:49,431 --> 03:10:57,754
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an issue on Butler Street last Tuesday evening when National Grid did a service change.

2411
03:10:58,554 --> 03:11:09,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And that evening at 1030, the construction company for National Grid came in and put hot top down.

2412
03:11:10,279 --> 03:11:11,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a few phone calls.

2413
03:11:11,460 --> 03:11:12,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in the neighborhood.

2414
03:11:12,762 --> 03:11:15,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out, I talked to the gentleman, and they stopped.

2415
03:11:16,104 --> 03:11:27,469
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know I talked to the acting DPW director today, and what's alarming to me, they don't have a record in who was working there.

2416
03:11:28,289 --> 03:11:35,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other piece of this that we need some clarification on is that the street's relatively new.

2417
03:11:35,593 --> 03:11:37,354
[SPEAKER_02]: They did this over about less than 10 years ago.

2418
03:11:38,014 --> 03:11:41,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the sidewalk in front of 12 Butler Street

2419
03:11:43,170 --> 03:11:47,654
[SPEAKER_02]: is now half cement, half concrete, half hot top.

2420
03:11:48,214 --> 03:11:57,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can, we just need some guidance in understanding what we're doing with our utilities.

2421
03:11:58,442 --> 03:12:03,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the more and more in the short time that I've been on this council, it's really irritating.

2422
03:12:04,086 --> 03:12:07,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they can get back to us, it would be greatly appreciated.

2423
03:12:07,209 --> 03:12:07,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2424
03:12:09,291 --> 03:12:11,352
[SPEAKER_10]: What time were they doing work on Butler, if I may ask?

2425
03:12:11,372 --> 03:12:11,352
10, 10.30.

2426
03:12:13,300 --> 03:12:16,401
[SPEAKER_02]: At night with two families with small children.

2427
03:12:16,881 --> 03:12:18,562
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're moving approval on these two papers?

2428
03:12:19,062 --> 03:12:19,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

2429
03:12:20,542 --> 03:12:21,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councillor Knight.

2430
03:12:21,783 --> 03:12:22,603
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favour?

2431
03:12:22,623 --> 03:12:23,583
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2432
03:12:23,663 --> 03:12:24,804
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

2433
03:12:24,844 --> 03:12:25,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Papers pass.

2434
03:12:27,465 --> 03:12:33,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved, offered by Councillor Falco, be it resolved that the Mayor contact the DCR

2435
03:12:37,691 --> 03:12:40,132
[SPEAKER_10]: To turn the gas at the corner of Webster and Fountain Street, Councillor Falco.

2436
03:13:04,789 --> 03:13:07,931
[SPEAKER_07]: This has come to my attention over the past, well, recently.

2437
03:13:10,373 --> 03:13:16,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's DCR property that it's at the intersection of Webster Street and Fountain.

2438
03:13:16,577 --> 03:13:24,862
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you took a left on the Fountain, it's that really odd, it's like an off-ramp, but you can go left and you can, it's like a two-way street.

2439
03:13:25,283 --> 03:13:27,144
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very dangerous to begin with.

2440
03:13:27,224 --> 03:13:31,847
[SPEAKER_07]: But the grass there has gotta be, if I'm guessing, two and a half to three feet tall.

2441
03:13:32,543 --> 03:13:38,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you come out of there, if you're taking a left, it's really a safety issue if you're trying to take a left coming out of there.

2442
03:13:38,425 --> 03:13:46,427
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would ask that the mayor contact the DCR to actually have that cut as soon as- It's the DOT?

2443
03:13:46,767 --> 03:13:52,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the DOT, whoever owns that property, DOT, DCR, to have that trimmed immediately.

2444
03:13:52,809 --> 03:13:56,010
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a safety hazard and it needs to be addressed as soon as possible.

2445
03:13:56,663 --> 03:13:57,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2446
03:13:57,683 --> 03:14:02,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion approval by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2447
03:14:05,506 --> 03:14:10,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the City Engineer report back to the, that's the same thing?

2448
03:14:12,409 --> 03:14:13,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Done twice, okay.

2449
03:14:13,710 --> 03:14:22,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford High School crew team be commended for winning the silver medal at the State Rowing Championship.

2450
03:14:22,493 --> 03:14:25,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that they appear before the City Council

2451
03:14:25,592 --> 03:14:26,113
[SPEAKER_10]: citations.

2452
03:14:26,273 --> 03:14:26,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval.

2453
03:14:27,033 --> 03:14:28,495
