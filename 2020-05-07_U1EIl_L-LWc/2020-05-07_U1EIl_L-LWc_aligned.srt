00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:18,717
Greetings and welcome, Andrews Middle School Class of 2023.

2
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:25,719
You are about to embark on a three-year adventure that will not only prepare you for high school, but will give you lots of opportunities to shine in and out of the classroom.

3
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,340
I'm a proud alumni of AMS and a soon-to-be grad of Medford High School.

4
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,663
As I head to the University of Rhode Island in the fall, I'll be taking with me many valuable academic, artistic, social lessons, and tools that I learned from AMS.

5
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:41,265
enjoy your time at the Anders Middle School because it's truly a special place.

6
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:42,506
Hi future AMSers.

7
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:56,577
It's my pleasure to introduce to you some of our amazing faculty and staff that are going to be incredibly dedicated to you during your time here and you know we're all just so excited for you to come and join us in the AMS family.

8
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:58,118
So welcome to the school.

9
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,662
Hello to our incoming sixth graders and their families.

10
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:04,363
My name is Miss Santos.

11
00:01:04,423 --> 00:01:06,445
I'll be one of your guidance counselors next year.

12
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:07,886
At the AMS,

13
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:13,677
All of our faculty and staff are dedicated to support and guide all of our AMS students.

14
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,758
We're really looking forward to seeing you all in the fall.

15
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,318
Hello, everybody.

16
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,238
My name is Ms.

17
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:19,298
Xu.

18
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:20,879
I teach sixth grade math.

19
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,420
I would like to share with you what makes Andrews Middle School a special place to learn and grow.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:37,362
When you come to Andrews Middle School next fall, you'll soon discover that it is a place where students find compassion, kindness, and caring from staff, teachers, and students.

21
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:45,209
One piece of advice I would like to give to incoming sixth graders is that you should take advantage of talking to your teachers.

22
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:59,101
If you have any questions on homework, classwork, quiz or test, talking to teachers after class or after school is a good way to get personal attention and to get help from your teachers.

23
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:03,505
I look forward to meeting all of you and hope to see you soon.

24
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:04,106
Bye.

25
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:07,945
Hello incoming Andrews Middle School 6th graders and families.

26
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:09,347
Hi, I'm Mr. Gallagher.

27
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:10,828
Welcome to the Andrews Middle School.

28
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:22,041
Today I just wanted to give you one tip on making the transition to middle school, and that is take your time, be patient, expect new things to happen, expect new people to do new things,

29
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:26,125
in new ways, but know that it's still school, like it's always been.

30
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,526
It's a safe place for you.

31
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:31,929
It's a place for learning, a place for new experiences, and a place for growing.

32
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,873
And that's the main point, you growing, becoming more of who you are.

33
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:39,895
Hi everyone, this is Mr. Michi.

34
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:46,360
I'd like to welcome every sixth grader and their families and all new students to Andrews Middle School.

35
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:55,537
I teach Italian and I give you my warmest and most cordial welcome in the Italian class.

36
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:56,938
So, welcome.

37
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,279
This is a song.

38
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:04,083
It's called Felicità by Albano and Romina Power that means happiness.

39
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:13,369
Felicità, è un bicchiere di vino Con un panino la felicità E lasciar camminare dentro al cassetto la felicità

40
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,375
I don't like this at all

41
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:31,251
Hey everybody, my name is Mr. Lam, I teach 6th grade at the Andrews, and one of the things that I think makes the Andrews such a special place to go to school is all the supports that we have as students and teachers.

42
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:47,635
We've got a great custodial staff at the Andrews, we've got great cafeteria workers, an incredibly dedicated group of paraprofessionals, great librarians, guidance counselors, school psychologists, all sorts of folks that are here to make your 6th grade and your whole middle school experience great.

43
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:50,097
Hola, I'm Ms.

44
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:50,717
Kammerer.

45
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:52,098
Hola, I'm Ms.

46
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:52,838
Kitchajian.

47
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,121
And we are the Spanish teachers at the Andrews Middle School.

48
00:03:57,898 --> 00:04:04,724
Should know if you ever have any questions or you're confused about something in class, you can always ask either of us to stay after with you.

49
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:07,646
We're both willing to stay after if you have any questions.

50
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:12,910
If you need to review something you didn't understand something or you just need help with your homework or project.

51
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:17,594
So don't be afraid to reach out and ask us after class.

52
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:19,236
If you need some extra help.

53
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:21,417
I'm seniorita Cameron.

54
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:24,320
I am so excited to meet you guys in the fall.

55
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:31,002
We hope that you have a safe and healthy summer, and we're so excited for the new year.

56
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:32,223
Adios!

57
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:32,884
Adios!

58
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:36,568
My name is Mrs. Baptiste, and I'm the band teacher at the middle school.

59
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:43,735
Middle school is going to be a wonderful phase of your academic career, and I can't wait to see my future band students on week one.

60
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:45,457
Until then, take care,

61
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,713
stay well, and keep practicing those instruments.

62
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:50,634
Bye!

63
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:55,597
Hello future sixth graders of the Andrews Middle School grade six.

64
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:59,520
My name is Mrs. Boost and I'm an ELA teacher on side 6B.

65
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,742
I love the Andrews and I know that you're going to love it too.

66
00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:06,525
If I had to give you one piece of advice for the new year,

67
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:11,171
is to come in with an open mind.

68
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:15,135
We promise to take care of you and guide you.

69
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,259
There's really nothing to be nervous about at all.

70
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,201
Welcome to the Andrews, everybody.

71
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,484
I can't wait to get to know each and every one of you.

72
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:24,066
See you in the fall.

73
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,375
Hello Andrews Middle School's incoming sixth graders.

74
00:05:27,896 --> 00:05:32,396
Just wanted to wish you all a wonderful virtual open house.

75
00:05:33,257 --> 00:05:37,357
You are coming into a really, really great atmosphere at the Andrews.

76
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:39,538
Teachers work very hard for you.

77
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:42,238
The kids work very hard for each other.

78
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:44,479
We have a really awesome motto.

79
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,919
It's called excellence through responsibility and respect.

80
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,080
And we abide by that in all of our facets of our school.

81
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,781
I hope you have a great rest of the school year and summer.

82
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:57,322
Look forward to seeing you guys in the fall.

83
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:12,888
AMS offers many after-school clubs and activities, including the CCSR, Builders Club, Drama Club, Boston Shakespeare Project, Art Club, GSA, Diversity Club, Dodgeball, Movie Club, Outing and Environmental Club, Yearbook Club, Soccer, and Basketball.

84
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:19,091
There will be a club and activity fair in the fall that will give you the opportunity to explore and sign up for these great activities.

85
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:34,236
Hello, I'm Sarah, president of the NJHS.

86
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:39,679
And I'm Lindsay, vice president, and we are very excited to welcome you to the Andrews Middle School.

87
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:46,462
We can't wait to tell you all about it, but first, here are some messages from the NJHS talking about what to expect and a little advice.

88
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,224
Make sure you stay kind to all peers, teachers, and other school staff.

89
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,125
Form good studying habits.

90
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:53,966
Don't stress studying for a test or quiz.

91
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:56,505
Be friendly to one another.

92
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:57,885
We're all in this together.

93
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:00,146
I hope you all have a great time here at the Andrews.

94
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:05,869
Hey guys, it's really important that you do your homework, because homework helps you prepare for tests and quizzes.

95
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:11,371
Make sure you're always going to class prepared with a pencil, necessary books, and materials.

96
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,633
Don't hesitate to ask teachers for help.

97
00:07:14,673 --> 00:07:15,573
They're here to help you.

98
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:20,976
Most teachers stay after school to help with classwork or homework to better understand the topics you're learning.

99
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:24,127
Use your agenda and write down assignments.

100
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:25,488
It will be your lifesaver.

101
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:35,355
It is very important that you stand on top of all the chapters and pages that your teacher signs for a certain book so that you do not get confused or behind on any of the homework and assignments.

102
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:40,559
Always listen to your teachers because they will provide helpful information that you don't want to miss.

103
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,222
Keep your blockers, notes, and everything else organized.

104
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,843
Don't be scared to make new friends and talk to new people.

105
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:53,371
You shouldn't fall behind or reward your schoolwork if it is not good for you or your grades, and it will add up in the end.

106
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:57,196
To all the incoming 6th graders, have fun in middle school.

107
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,278
It goes by super fast.

108
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:28,930
Hi, my name is Ms.

109
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,491
Van Doyen.

110
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:32,853
I am one of the CCSR advisors at the Andrews Middle School.

111
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:37,397
I am also one of the physical education teachers, so I am looking forward to meeting you all next year.

112
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:45,783
CCSR is a project-based group that focuses on giving back to the community, and we welcome anyone to come and join us.

113
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,925
So I hope to see you guys join next year.

114
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:53,547
I joined CCSR in fifth grade because it was on the list of clubs and I decided to try it out.

115
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,950
I'm still in CCSR to this day.

116
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:03,356
I look forward to doing CCSR in the future because it is a place where I can do good things for others and great things for the community.

117
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,898
Hi, I'm Sophia.

118
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:15,027
For CCSR, my group did a fundraiser for an animal shelter called Skylands and basically we made it so that they could get some extra money for the proper food and shelter for their animals.

119
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,633
I joined CCSR because you can do really fun projects in a great environment and help out your community at the same time.

120
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:31,261
I joined CCSR because I want to be part of the community and have fun and donate money for good causes.

121
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:36,720
Our project was to find ways to decorate the school to make it a happier and more cheerful place.

122
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:45,065
We did this because we feel that kids who are happy will learn better and be able to feel excited about learning in different ways.

123
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,326
Hi future Andrews students!

124
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:50,289
My name is Mr. Zizzo and I am a 7th grade social studies teacher here at the Andrews.

125
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:55,112
In the 7th grade in social studies you'll be learning about world cultures and

126
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,833
You'll also have the opportunity to take part in a program that's called Global Scholars.

127
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:08,559
In Global Scholars, you get to connect with students from all around the world through a digital classroom, Skype chats, and so much more.

128
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,744
During this program, you'll have the opportunity to learn about environmental issues and ways to solve those issues.

129
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:23,210
You'll also have the opportunity to create some wonderful digital projects and share them with those international classmates in the eClassroom.

130
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:29,745
I am very much looking forward to meeting you all, and can't wait to see you soon when you join the Andrews community.

131
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:30,586
Have a great day.

132
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:45,678
Hey there, future AMSers.

133
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:47,520
This is Miss Grant, your music teacher.

134
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,163
And I'm really looking forward to meeting you all and singing the Andrews Middle School anthem, Hey You're OK.

135
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:18,190
The differences between us can make each other stronger Unexpected friendships last much longer We can help each other shine much brighter If we band together, we'll reach much higher You won't ever learn anything new If you only talk to people who are just like you See you in the fall!
