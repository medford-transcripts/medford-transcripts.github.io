[SPEAKER_17]: You are about to embark on a three-year adventure that will not only prepare you for high school, but will give you lots of opportunities to shine in and out of the classroom.

3
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,340
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a proud alumni of AMS and a soon-to-be grad of Medford High School.

4
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,663
[SPEAKER_17]: As I head to the University of Rhode Island in the fall, I'll be taking with me many valuable academic, artistic, social lessons, and tools that I learned from AMS.

5
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:41,265
[SPEAKER_17]: enjoy your time at the Anders Middle School because it's truly a special place.

6
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:42,506

00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:56,577
[SPEAKER_12]: It's my pleasure to introduce to you some of our amazing faculty and staff that are going to be incredibly dedicated to you during your time here and you know we're all just so excited for you to come and join us in the AMS family.

[SPEAKER_12]: So welcome to the school.

9
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello to our incoming sixth graders and their families.

10
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:04,363
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Miss Santos.

11
00:01:04,423 --> 00:01:06,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be one of your guidance counselors next year.

12
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:07,886

00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:13,677
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our faculty and staff are dedicated to support and guide all of our AMS students.

14
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,758
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really looking forward to seeing you all in the fall.

15
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody.

16
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,238
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Ms.

17
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:19,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Xu.

18
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:20,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach sixth grade math.

19
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to share with you what makes Andrews Middle School a special place to learn and grow.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:37,362
[SPEAKER_02]: When you come to Andrews Middle School next fall, you'll soon discover that it is a place where students find compassion, kindness, and caring from staff, teachers, and students.

21
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:45,209
[SPEAKER_02]: One piece of advice I would like to give to incoming sixth graders is that you should take advantage of talking to your teachers.

22
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:59,101
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions on homework, classwork, quiz or test, talking to teachers after class or after school is a good way to get personal attention and to get help from your teachers.

23
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:03,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to meeting all of you and hope to see you soon.

24
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:04,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

25
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:07,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello incoming Andrews Middle School 6th graders and families.

26
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:09,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Mr. Gallagher.

27
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:10,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Andrews Middle School.

28
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:22,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I just wanted to give you one tip on making the transition to middle school, and that is take your time, be patient, expect new things to happen, expect new people to do new things,

29
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:26,125
[SPEAKER_01]: in new ways, but know that it's still school, like it's always been.

30
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,526
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a safe place for you.

31
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:31,929
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a place for learning, a place for new experiences, and a place for growing.

32
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the main point, you growing, becoming more of who you are.

33
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:39,895
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi everyone, this is Mr. Michi.

34
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:46,360
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to welcome every sixth grader and their families and all new students to Andrews Middle School.

35
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:55,537
[SPEAKER_22]: I teach Italian and I give you my warmest and most cordial welcome in the Italian class.

36
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:56,938
[SPEAKER_22]: So, welcome.

37
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,279
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a song.

38
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:04,083
[SPEAKER_22]: It's called Felicità by Albano and Romina Power that means happiness.

39
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:13,369
[SPEAKER_22]: Felicità, è un bicchiere di vino Con un panino la felicità E lasciar camminare dentro al cassetto la felicità

40
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,375
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like this at all

41
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:31,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey everybody, my name is Mr. Lam, I teach 6th grade at the Andrews, and one of the things that I think makes the Andrews such a special place to go to school is all the supports that we have as students and teachers.

42
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:47,635
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got a great custodial staff at the Andrews, we've got great cafeteria workers, an incredibly dedicated group of paraprofessionals, great librarians, guidance counselors, school psychologists, all sorts of folks that are here to make your 6th grade and your whole middle school experience great.

43
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:50,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Hola, I'm Ms.

44
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:50,717

[SPEAKER_09]: And we are the Spanish teachers at the Andrews Middle School.

48
00:03:57,898 --> 00:04:04,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Should know if you ever have any questions or you're confused about something in class, you can always ask either of us to stay after with you.

49
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:07,646
[SPEAKER_08]: We're both willing to stay after if you have any questions.

50
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:12,910
[SPEAKER_08]: If you need to review something you didn't understand something or you just need help with your homework or project.

51
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:17,594
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't be afraid to reach out and ask us after class.

52
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:19,236
[SPEAKER_08]: If you need some extra help.

53

[SPEAKER_09]: I'm seniorita Cameron.

54
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:24,320

57
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:32,884
[SPEAKER_26]: Adios!

58
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:36,568
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Mrs. Baptiste, and I'm the band teacher at the middle school.

59
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:43,735
[SPEAKER_26]: Middle school is going to be a wonderful phase of your academic career, and I can't wait to see my future band students on week one.

60
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:45,457
[SPEAKER_26]: Until then, take care,

61
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,713
[SPEAKER_26]: stay well, and keep practicing those instruments.

63
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:55,597

64
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:59,520
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Mrs. Boost and I'm an ELA teacher on side 6B.

65
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,742
[SPEAKER_23]: I love the Andrews and I know that you're going to love it too.

66
00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:06,525
[SPEAKER_23]: If I had to give you one piece of advice for the new year,

67
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:11,171
[SPEAKER_23]: is to come in with an open mind.

68
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:15,135

69
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,259

70
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,201

00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,484

78
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:44,479
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a really awesome motto.

79
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,919

00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,080

85
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:34,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, I'm Sarah, president of the NJHS.

86
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:39,679
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm Lindsay, vice president, and we are very excited to welcome you to the Andrews Middle School.

87
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:46,462
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't wait to tell you all about it, but first, here are some messages from the NJHS talking about what to expect and a little advice.

88
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Make sure you stay kind to all peers, teachers, and other school staff.

89
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,125

90
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:53,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't stress studying for a test or quiz.

00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:56,505

93
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:00,146
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you all have a great time here at the Andrews.

94
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:05,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey guys, it's really important that you do your homework, because homework helps you prepare for tests and quizzes.

95
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:11,371
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure you're always going to class prepared with a pencil, necessary books, and materials.

96
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't hesitate to ask teachers for help.

97
00:07:14,673 --> 00:07:15,573
[SPEAKER_13]: They're here to help you.

98
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:20,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Most teachers stay after school to help with classwork or homework to better understand the topics you're learning.

99
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:24,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Use your agenda and write down assignments.

100
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:25,488
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be your lifesaver.

101
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:35,355
[SPEAKER_18]: It is very important that you stand on top of all the chapters and pages that your teacher signs for a certain book so that you do not get confused or behind on any of the homework and assignments.

102
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:40,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Always listen to your teachers because they will provide helpful information that you don't want to miss.

103
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep your blockers, notes, and everything else organized.

104
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,843
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't be scared to make new friends and talk to new people.

105
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:53,371
[SPEAKER_19]: You shouldn't fall behind or reward your schoolwork if it is not good for you or your grades, and it will add up in the end.

106
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:57,196
[SPEAKER_18]: To all the incoming 6th graders, have fun in middle school.

107
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,278
[SPEAKER_18]: It goes by super fast.

108
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:28,930
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, my name is Ms.

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,491

[SPEAKER_20]: I am one of the CCSR advisors at the Andrews Middle School.

111
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:37,397
[SPEAKER_20]: I am also one of the physical education teachers, so I am looking forward to meeting you all next year.

112
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:45,783
[SPEAKER_20]: CCSR is a project-based group that focuses on giving back to the community, and we welcome anyone to come and join us.

113
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,925
[SPEAKER_20]: So I hope to see you guys join next year.

114
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:53,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I joined CCSR in fifth grade because it was on the list of clubs and I decided to try it out.

115
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still in CCSR to this day.

116
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:03,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to doing CCSR in the future because it is a place where I can do good things for others and great things for the community.

117
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, I'm Sophia.

118
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:15,027
[SPEAKER_11]: For CCSR, my group did a fundraiser for an animal shelter called Skylands and basically we made it so that they could get some extra money for the proper food and shelter for their animals.

119
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,633
[SPEAKER_10]: I joined CCSR because you can do really fun projects in a great environment and help out your community at the same time.

120
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:31,261
[SPEAKER_27]: I joined CCSR because I want to be part of the community and have fun and donate money for good causes.

121
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:36,720
[SPEAKER_19]: Our project was to find ways to decorate the school to make it a happier and more cheerful place.

122
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:45,065
[SPEAKER_19]: We did this because we feel that kids who are happy will learn better and be able to feel excited about learning in different ways.

123
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,326
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi future Andrews students!

124
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:50,289
