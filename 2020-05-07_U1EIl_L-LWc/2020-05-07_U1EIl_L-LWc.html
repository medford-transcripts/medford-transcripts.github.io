    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U1EIl_L-LWc&t=555.99s">I</a>  joined CCSR because you can do really fun projects in a great environment and help out your community at the same time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U1EIl_L-LWc&t=562.475s">I</a>  joined CCSR because I want to be part of the community and have fun and donate money for good causes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/U1EIl_L-LWc&t=572.597s">Our</a>  project was to find ways to decorate the school to make it a happier and more cheerful place. <a href="https://youtu.be/U1EIl_L-LWc&t=577.22s">We</a>  did this because we feel that kids who are happy will learn better and be able to feel excited about learning in different ways.</p>
