1
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:05,814
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, welcome to the March 7th, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

2
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:12,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Our first order of business is to talk about and accept the minutes.

3
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:16,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Did everyone have a chance to look at the minutes from our last meeting?

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Move approval.

5
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,784
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll second that.

6
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:23,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

7
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:24,345
[SPEAKER_13]: All in favor?

8
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:25,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

9
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:26,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

10
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:27,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

11
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:40,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so our next agenda item is we need to move on to talking about Article 6, which is financial procedures and budget.

12
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:45,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have the Collins Center here, Anthony and Frank.

13
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:49,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you two prepare a presentation or do you just want to take questions?

14
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:51,089
[SPEAKER_13]: How do we want to do it?

15
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:55,670
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not have a presentation, but we're prepared to take questions.

16
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:58,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so the main things.

17
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:04,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I've sent you guys all you've seen the template of what article six entails.

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,461
[SPEAKER_13]: So we want to just sort of

19
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:36,747
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have any questions about that or any particular issues that you want to talk about related to that, we also have on the table the budget amendment that the city council presented last year, which we should probably discuss and decide one way or the other whether we think we should recommend it as is or something else.

20
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:41,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just say what you just said one more time about last year.

21
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,351
[SPEAKER_13]: The city council.

22
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:46,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, David, that was before you joined the committee.

23
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,918
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know if you've actually seen the text and I should have sent it out.

24
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:50,899
[SPEAKER_13]: So I apologize.

25
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,381
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad.

26
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:56,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody else knows what I'm talking about, right?

27
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:58,773
[SPEAKER_13]: You're talking about the budget ordinance?

28
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:00,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Not the ordinance.

29
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:04,597
[SPEAKER_13]: There was an amendment to the charter that the city council proposed.

30
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:05,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, right.

31
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:10,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not know about it, Melva, because I don't think I was there when that was done also.

32
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:11,182
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

33
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:20,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Then it essentially, does somebody who's familiar with it want to say what it, I mean, I will share the whole text with you, but

34
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Does somebody want to summarize it?

35
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:29,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sort of drawing a blank because I've been looking at the ordinance lately.

36
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

37
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have the text up if you want me to share the screen.

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:34,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

39
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,861
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be great.

40
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me give you that.

41
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:48,724
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the city council's attempt to get control of the whole process, the timeline, what they can and what they can't.

42
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,805
[SPEAKER_05]: It was their attempt at doing a charter review.

43
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:52,929
[SPEAKER_13]: It didn't involve the timeline.

44
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:54,891
[SPEAKER_13]: The timeline is something we have to discuss.

45
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:58,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought part of it was that.

46
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:00,396
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a timeline in there, I think.

47
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It started when it was supposed to start.

48
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:04,439
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to look at it.

49
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:17,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the main thing was instead of just taking money out of the budget, they could move money in the budget as long as they didn't change the bottom line of the amount.

50
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:18,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

51
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:21,408
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is it.

52
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,409
[SPEAKER_13]: So now everybody can see it.

53
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,430
[SPEAKER_13]: And Jean, you did just sort of say what the main aspect of it.

54
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:36,452
[SPEAKER_13]: It does involve timeline issues, which is definitely something that we're going to talk about, because that is included in Article 6.

55
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:42,634
[SPEAKER_13]: But the main part of it was the power to move

56
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,501
[SPEAKER_13]: move money, right, basically, from one appropriation to another.

57
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:53,184
[SPEAKER_01]: It could subtract and add to different lines in the budget.

58
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:54,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

59
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:59,590
[SPEAKER_13]: So does anybody have any questions about it for the Collins Center?

60
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this the entirety of a text that they suggested?

61
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:06,456
[SPEAKER_13]: For the budget.

62
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:07,316
[SPEAKER_14]: There is more.

63
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:07,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

64
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:20,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, if you see the link at the top of my window there, I think this is from the city's archive.

65
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:27,519
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, let me put this into the chat for those of you that want to see the actual document.

66
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:34,008
[SPEAKER_13]: And Paulette, you, let's see, I see Paulette has a question, so.

67
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:43,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so what I'm asking is, does this mean that the city council could then change an item in the school committee budget?

68
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,218
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe.

69
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't the school committee budget separate or maybe?

70
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:57,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the city council has the authority to touch the school committee budget.

71
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Anthony or Frank, do you know?

72
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:08,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so by state law, city councils only approve the school committee budget as presented.

73
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,719
[SPEAKER_04]: They either approve it or they don't approve it.

74
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:21,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I wanted just to be very clear that this, when it says that they can move things around, does not change the process for the school committee budget.

75
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:27,033
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want the city council second-guessing the school committee.

76
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:33,234
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my understanding, Paulette, and you would know better than I do, that it's against the law to do that.

77
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I thought that that was Massachusetts general law.

78
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:38,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily our charge.

79
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:43,277
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to be clear, because we have this, and that's, you know.

80
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:51,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Massachusetts general law does not allow them to change the school committee budget.

81
00:05:51,596 --> 00:06:01,758
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Massachusetts general law also does not allow city councils to move money around in budgets or to add anything to a budget line.

82
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:04,219
[SPEAKER_04]: They're only allowed to cut.

83
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:11,720
[SPEAKER_04]: So this charter would be asking the legislature to, this charter provision,

84
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:30,263
[SPEAKER_04]: if included in a proposed new charter, would be requesting the legislature to approve a provision which would be distinct from state law as applies to other municipalities in the Commonwealth.

85
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:42,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I read this, I don't see then if what Frank just said, I don't see the distinction that would keep a city councilor from saying, well, let's move this in the school committee budget.

86
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:46,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you, Paulette.

87
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,973
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think language to that effect needs to be added.

88
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:55,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, only if we're going to include it in the charter.

89
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,684
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't even include any of this in the charter.

90
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:10,971
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, if you recall, this was the city council's way to try to take a jockey position away from the mayor, for lack of a better term.

91
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:16,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it a standing document?

92
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:19,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it have any validity?

93
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:20,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, wait a minute.

94
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:21,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I want it.

95
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,775
[SPEAKER_13]: David has a stand up, so I want to hear from him.

96
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:35,837
[SPEAKER_13]: But Phyllis, what this is, is it's an amendment that the city council proposed and asked the mayor to approve it, at which point it would have gone to the Attorney General.

97
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:41,878
[SPEAKER_13]: But she didn't do that, and it was sort of thrown back to us because we are reviewing the charter.

98
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:44,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, thank you, Milton.

99
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:46,809
[SPEAKER_04]: As a correction, it wouldn't go to the Attorney General.

100
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,793
[SPEAKER_04]: When towns make changes, they go to the Attorney General.

101
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:55,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Cities, when they propose charter changes, they go to the legislature.

102
00:07:56,278 --> 00:08:08,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, City Council specifically talked about, I'm not gonna remember the number, the provision off the top of my head, but they specifically talked about a process for making an amendment that would

103
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,257
[SPEAKER_13]: that it would go to the Attorney General.

104
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:14,099
[SPEAKER_13]: So they could have been wrong, but that is definitely what they talked about.

105
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:26,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what they're creating is a home rule petition, which goes as a... No, they weren't creating... No, but that's basically what they're doing when they're doing this without calling it that, and then it goes to the House.

106
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:33,928
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a process for making charter amendments, and that's what they were going to use.

107
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,610
[SPEAKER_13]: That would have not had it go through the State House.

108
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:44,119
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may, and I don't mean to shut down the debate, there are different processes for making charterments.

109
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:51,400
[SPEAKER_03]: to the Attorney General versus going to the legislature.

110
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:57,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one key distinction for the purpose of this discussion is on the substance of the change.

111
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:11,057
[SPEAKER_03]: This type of change being a significant change from the budget process outlined in understate law would probably have to go through the legislature and have to be approved as a special act, sort of a special exemption for Medford.

112
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:25,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's interesting because the city council, when they proposed it, specifically because it didn't affect the composition of the local government or anything like that, specifically felt that it could fall under one of those types of amendments that could go to the attorney general.

113
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:29,467
[SPEAKER_13]: But that aside, David, I'd like to hear from you now.

114
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:31,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

115
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a few different questions.

116
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:42,194
[SPEAKER_02]: 1 is I would love an overview of the current budget process because I didn't understand that.

117
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:44,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So, does the mayor produce 2 different budgets?

118
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:44,536
1.

119
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:48,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the city at large and a different 1 for the schools is 1 question.

120
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.

121
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:53,024
[SPEAKER_02]: A 2nd question is kind of a procedural question, which was.

122
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:59,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that this discussion of budget procedures and stuff was maybe going to go to a subcommittee.

123
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:29,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this like we it has gone to the subcommittee and now we're talking about as the whole um and the third thing I guess is um Uh, yeah, i'd love an overview I guess also of state law in regards to this stuff um Because I personally i'm like more than happy to to uh, write our charter in such a way that it

124
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:42,402
[SPEAKER_02]: requires special permissions under state law, but I realize that that's, you know, in a charter that is probably already going to be some work to get it passed, it kind of adds to the level of difficulty possibly.

125
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess all three of the...

126
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for having three questions.

127
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:49,191
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

128
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:52,572
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to let the Collins Center answer the main question.

129
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:58,814
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just quickly say that we have not formed a subcommittee for this, and if we feel that we need one, we will.

130
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:01,955
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanted the whole committee to have a chance to talk about it first.

131
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:09,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Frank, I was going to say, feel free to chime in here.

132
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll sort of talk at a high level to answer your question.

133
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:23,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So, generally speaking across the Commonwealth, the budget procedure, that's, you know, the steps it has to take and the timeline that it has to follow is outlined in Chapter

134
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:26,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, section 32 of chapter 44.

135
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:32,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It has some sort of explicit timelines that cities have to follow.

136
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:40,613
[SPEAKER_03]: It specifically states that there's a specific time, or sorry, a deadline in which the mayor submits their budget to the city council.

137
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:50,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And it states that the city council, and this applies to cities, not to town meeting, but it specifically states that city councils

138
00:11:50,997 --> 00:12:18,525
[SPEAKER_03]: can cut um the budget or can cut budget line items but it cannot make um it cannot increase line items or increase the budget generally um i don't i don't i don't have the specific section in here but there's a uh there's also a line stating um the uh budget creation procedure for the school committee the school committee has a little bit more leeway with the school uh department budget they the school committee itself can sort of increase and decrease and move

139
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:24,468
[SPEAKER_03]: things around in its budget, but it ultimately goes to the city council with the full mayoral budget.

140
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:32,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can't be, Frank, correct me if I'm wrong, I think it can't be reduced, but it can be rejected.

141
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's true.

142
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,533
[SPEAKER_04]: The City Council can only vote a school committee budget up and down.

143
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:48,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly what the procedure is in Medford, but my experience from other municipalities is that the superintendent

144
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:59,844
[SPEAKER_04]: along with the mayor, but primarily the superintendent, proposes a budget, which the mayor then incorporates into an overall budget to present to the city council.

145
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:07,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the superintendent and generally the finance officer from the school department will present it to the city council.

146
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:08,965
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor may be there.

147
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:12,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I've seen them there, sometimes I haven't.

148
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:18,887
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it's up to the city council, as Anthony said earlier, to either vote it up or down.

149
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,663
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no opportunity to make any amendments cuts or just a really quick follow up question to that.

150
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:29,725
[SPEAKER_02]: If the school committee votes to ask for 30Million dollars.

151
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:32,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mayor only wants to give him 5.

152
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:34,088
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that work out?

153
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:37,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it that the mayor says you have 5Million dollars to use?

154
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,051
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you want to split it up.

155
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the school committee splits it up from there.

156
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:46,009
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a collaborative process with the mayor.

157
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,890
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't, I wouldn't say they wouldn't.

158
00:13:47,930 --> 00:14:00,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Frank's been part of this process a lot, but it's, I think the ideal case is that the school department knows how much it's getting sort of in school aid.

159
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:08,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Under law, the school department has to provide, I'm not an expert in school reform, but under state law, there are certain sort of,

160
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:13,486
[SPEAKER_03]: minimums that the school department has to comply with, that the city has to comply with.

161
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:29,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So it knows those and then it knows sort of what can go over it and it's sort of a negotiation with the mayor and sort of their budget in terms of revenues and how they can divide those between, if we just think sort of basically between schools and municipal government between there.

162
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Frank, feel free to clarify anything I may have mixed up or jumbled.

163
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,765
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not an expert on school budgets either, but I think you pretty much summed it up.

164
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,126
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my experiences.

165
00:14:41,226 --> 00:14:44,148
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a collaborative process and ultimately.

166
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,333
[SPEAKER_04]: The superintendent draft the initial budget and.

167
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:59,115
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, with them as input, because obviously there's an overall budget amount that the city has to work with.

168
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:03,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the mayor obviously has other needs beyond the schools.

169
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:14,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they try to present, they try to work together so that what they present to the city council that they both can stand behind and be comfortable with.

170
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:14,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

171
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:24,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I met, I don't mean to bore the committee, but but I'll just let me just read a quick excerpt from the section having to do with the school committee.

172
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:41,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the case of the school budget or in the case of a regional district assessment, the city council on the recommendation of the school committee or recommendation of the regional district school may by two thirds vote, increase the total amount appropriated for the support of the schools or the regional school district.

173
00:15:42,012 --> 00:15:42,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was

174
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:50,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's the ability to increase the school budget only with the approval over over that requested by the mayor.

175
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:51,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

176
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:54,459
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at the end of the day, my question was, who's requesting the money?

177
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,520
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the mayor who's requesting.

178
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:02,163
[SPEAKER_02]: The money is, I think, kind of an important power bit there.

179
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thanks.

180
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:08,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, Anthony, did you have your hand raised?

181
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:10,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I did.

182
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:13,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just wondering if the comment center can comment.

183
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:25,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that Boston had adopted this type of budgeting process, and it's only been around for about two years, and they had quite a bit of trouble with it.

184
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:53,652
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a problem, too, when it comes to collective bargaining, where the city council could, in effect, kind of interfere with the ability of a mayor or a bargaining unit to bargain with a union when they don't have the final authority of the funds.

185
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:54,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

186
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, just a couple.

187
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,150
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very new.

188
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not so I would say sort of take everything that I say with a little bit of a grain of salt.

189
00:17:06,432 --> 00:17:14,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But I thought we sort of maybe did a memo on this, but I may be mixing up my projects, but.

190
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:23,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Boston is the only community in Massachusetts right now where the city council has the ability to increase or decrease lines in the budget.

191
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:25,842
[SPEAKER_03]: As you correctly pointed out, it's new.

192
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:28,985
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened in the past two years.

193
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:33,308
[SPEAKER_03]: They just went through a budget process where it happened that

194
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:52,373
[SPEAKER_03]: from the perspective of outsiders seemed pretty contentious and one of the issues raised was I think the City Council moved some money around or took money out of one budget area where the mayor's retort was about the impact that would have on their

195
00:17:53,854 --> 00:17:58,019
[SPEAKER_03]: on the labor relations piece, the collective bargaining, as you correctly pointed out.

196
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:08,694
[SPEAKER_03]: There haven't been any specific, I think, guidelines that have come out, but when we talked to city managers, finance officials,

197
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,179
[SPEAKER_03]: There is the concern about the process in Boston.

198
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:15,980
[SPEAKER_03]: It took longer.

199
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:24,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the consensus is that their budgeting process took longer, was more contentious than it maybe had been in the past, is sort of what we're hearing generally.

200
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:27,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Frank, please chime in.

201
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:38,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a lot of expertise in what's going on in Boston, but what you're saying is consistent with my understanding, Anthony.

202
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:55,335
[SPEAKER_04]: What's important to remember is collective bargaining agreements always have a proviso that the funding of it is always subject to annual appropriation by the city council because

203
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:57,666
[SPEAKER_04]: They only have an annual budget.

204
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:58,827
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't commit money.

205
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:06,373
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have a three-year contract, but they cannot commit money that they don't have that goes beyond that first year.

206
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:20,263
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, collective bargaining agreements are generally approved or signed by the mayor, but the money for the first year is committed and appropriated oftentimes out of a

207
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:33,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Salary fund, so to speak, that that's been stabilization fund and.

208
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:43,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the administration, the mayor has control, but allowing the city council now to step in annually and make.

209
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:48,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Changes to the budget can kind of make that very, um.

210
00:19:51,756 --> 00:20:06,487
[SPEAKER_04]: less stable, I guess, situation for both the executive administration, the mayor's running of the city on a day-to-day basis, and for the collective bargaining units in the city.

211
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

212
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:11,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

213
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:12,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Gene?

214
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:31,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason City Council did this or some of the, what I've heard is that they often got the budget so late, like timing of the budget when the budget came to them was an issue.

215
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:39,283
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't always apprised of revenue or how the budget looked halfway through the process.

216
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:47,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any way of balancing the power on some of those issues, even if it's not giving them the opportunity to move money around?

217
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:52,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, can I ask a question?

218
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:17,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Is not the mayor and the city council in the process of piloting a budget process where this year they are doing this exact thing about the dates in January and in the spring, and if it works out, they plan on

219
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:21,829
[SPEAKER_08]: passing an ordinance about it next year.

220
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:23,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I correct?

221
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,730
[SPEAKER_13]: You are right.

222
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:25,950
[SPEAKER_13]: That is true.

223
00:21:26,491 --> 00:21:33,113
[SPEAKER_13]: But for us, we're looking at the question of what do we want to codify in the charter regarding the process.

224
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:41,956
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, it may, and I think as I sent out article six and timeline is covered in there.

225
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,616
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it is something we can look at.

226
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you agree, Anthony and Frank?

227
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:59,563
[SPEAKER_04]: My recollection is that Marilyn had indicated that she had seen that and had language from other municipalities consistent with that thought process.

228
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:01,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

229
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:06,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just to add on there, one of the things that we've done in other communities is

230
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:31,641
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of in working with obviously the committee and sort of balancing those issues is thinking about times when the city council, the mayor, and the school committee can meet publicly and work together to think about what are the expected revenues, what are the expected expenses, and to sort of co-create some of those high-level priorities.

231
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:40,951
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of the nitty gritty things that happens during the budget process is the mayor sort of meets internally with the departments who kind of explain here are the.

232
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:45,816
[SPEAKER_03]: The things that they that they have to do here are the things that they want to do here are things that.

233
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:51,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's how much those things cost all over the sort of oversight of the.

234
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:57,507
[SPEAKER_03]: of this sort of finance form that says, here's what we're expecting our funds to be and how they align with the things.

235
00:22:57,747 --> 00:22:59,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sort of drives the budget process internally.

236
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:19,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And so really setting a meeting between those three bodies publicly early in the process to set those priority goals, to do some level setting about here's what we're expecting in terms of revenue, and include those bodies in the process a lot earlier than may have traditionally been the practice, which it sounds like Medford's piloting now.

237
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:22,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thank you.

238
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:27,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you, is that, do you feel like you got an answer, Jean, or do you wanna?

239
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:30,548
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's good.

240
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:32,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

241
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:32,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Ron.

242
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:36,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have some information.

243
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:44,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the council president's proposed thought.

244
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:46,192
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want me to, I can share it.

245
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:47,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you talking about the ordinance?

246
00:23:48,442 --> 00:24:03,758
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm talking about the budget plan the future budget plan what it is now what they expect it to be so it may it may lighten people on you know what it is that the goal is here so do you want me to just share it, you know, I think, I think that.

247
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:16,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people can look at that if they want to, but right now, I think... The only reason why I say it is because there is a plan, there are dates, there are procedures.

248
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:24,551
[SPEAKER_05]: In April, they will sit down and do their own charter review, which they've already announced will be a separate from our charter review.

249
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:32,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to go crazy into this process because it's really... It'd be interesting to look at what their plan is, but I don't...

250
00:24:34,622 --> 00:24:37,143
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think we should pick and go.

251
00:24:37,383 --> 00:24:46,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that they've already announced that, you know, we're appointed by one person in the city and they're elected, so they'll do their own thing and they won't collaborate.

252
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:49,685
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I just wanna get that out.

253
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:50,745
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a plan out there.

254
00:24:52,506 --> 00:24:53,566
[SPEAKER_05]: They're following this plan.

255
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:55,026
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going through the details in April.

256
00:24:55,066 --> 00:25:03,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you wanted to see the plan, you can look, I'll send out, I'll email everybody the link if you want to look at.

257
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:04,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

258
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:06,123
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can look at it.

259
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:13,850
[SPEAKER_13]: My sense is that it has a lot more detail than we might include in the charter, but it definitely does include some things that we would be looking at.

260
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, the time.

261
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:17,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Surprisingly, it's not very detailed.

262
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:18,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

263
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:20,936
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll take a look at it.

264
00:25:22,597 --> 00:25:24,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Eunice, and then Aubrey, and then Paulette.

265
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks.

266
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:54,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, to provide, I think, a little bit of context, perhaps, for people, I think a lot of this stemmed from, I don't know, maybe it was three years ago, maybe 2021, when, and maybe Paulette might be able to help me out here, when there wasn't, I guess they found a pretty big shortfall and

267
00:25:57,162 --> 00:26:11,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the details, but the long and short of it was that the city council never really got, the mayor puts together a budget book, which has the entire budget for all the different departments and so forth, and a lot of overview and things.

268
00:26:11,507 --> 00:26:13,008
[SPEAKER_07]: They never got a budget book.

269
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:18,150
[SPEAKER_07]: They typically meet with department heads

270
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Each department had to find a little bit about their budget.

271
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:25,716
[SPEAKER_07]: They never got a lot of the data that they typically would get.

272
00:26:26,196 --> 00:26:28,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they did get, they got very late.

273
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:37,206
[SPEAKER_07]: And they ended up having to go through the budget process with very little information to go on.

274
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:43,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And the budget meeting went for hours upon hours upon hours, I think.

275
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:49,356
[SPEAKER_07]: It's they usually vote on the budget on the last Tuesday of June and this particular meeting.

276
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:51,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And they do other things on the agenda.

277
00:26:51,758 --> 00:27:02,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a typical city council meeting, but the meeting went until, like, 1 o'clock in the morning, which is a typical and they weren't going to pass the budget.

278
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,749
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the mayor at 1 o'clock in the morning found money for.

279
00:27:05,646 --> 00:27:09,448
[SPEAKER_07]: something that they wanted, and lo and behold, the budget passed.

280
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:23,297
[SPEAKER_07]: City Council felt that they never wanted to go through that sort of mess again, and they began crafting ways to streamline and make the process better.

281
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:30,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and so what they're in addition to the charter amendment that they've.

282
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:41,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Been talking about that we just brought up, they're also creating a whole ordinance and they've got the chief of staff and Bob Dickens in the.

283
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:47,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Finance director working with them on this.

284
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:55,474
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think my question is what we're doing with the charter and what they're doing with the ordinance.

285
00:27:56,135 --> 00:28:02,458
[SPEAKER_07]: And they talk about timing and information that's required to be provided and so forth.

286
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,422
[SPEAKER_07]: How much do we get into the weeds in article six?

287
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:16,288
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what what we're doing versus what they're doing.

288
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:21,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'm trying to spit it out is.

289
00:28:21,794 --> 00:28:24,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there overlap?

290
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:26,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we doing what they're doing?

291
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:28,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they doing what we're doing?

292
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:34,328
[SPEAKER_07]: What's our responsibility under the charter to include.

293
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:45,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know a lot of things in the overall charter, there's also ordinances under that as well and rules and so forth.

294
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:58,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that I'm making a whole lot of sense, but what are we doing in the charter and what are they doing in the ordinance and how do the two things coexist together?

295
00:28:59,011 --> 00:28:59,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

296
00:29:03,553 --> 00:29:04,653
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that makes a lot of sense.

297
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Anthony or Frank, do you want to try to answer?

298
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:19,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I may ask a clarifying question.

299
00:29:20,547 --> 00:29:30,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Assuming that you have a charter recommendation and the charter gets approved by the council, the charter supersedes any ordinances in terms of the work of the committee.

300
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:45,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, there are recommendations on best practices, but to the extent that you're aware that there are some issues, to be sensitive to them as you craft your, the process in your financial procedure section of the charter.

301
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:56,997
[SPEAKER_03]: While we recommend that there is a financial procedure section, and you, I guess in theory, you can get as detailed as you want in your financial procedure sections of the charter.

302
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:08,984
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we have examples of charters, so there are sort of best practices on what makes sense to go into that section and really how detailed to be.

303
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:12,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I think timelines are generally very helpful.

304
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:21,184
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of roles, I think you mentioned, someone mentioned something about the chief of staff being in there.

305
00:30:21,464 --> 00:30:35,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that would be our recommendation to sort of mention these specific positions rather than the authority of the established mayor and the legislative branch of city council in sort of the times when they have to do things.

306
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's probably,

307
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:41,239
[SPEAKER_03]: more appropriate for a document that could last for 100 or several hundred years.

308
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:46,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if that's responsible, but I tried.

309
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:48,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

310
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:54,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just so confused, but that's okay.

311
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I sent out, I sent the ordinance, the city clerk sent me the draft ordinance.

312
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:03,062
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been working on this for a while.

313
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:09,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And the most recent iteration of it is from just a week or so ago, February 28th.

314
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent it to Melva.

315
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:16,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it from the clerk and she can, you know, you can send it out.

316
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:18,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it makes sense for the whole group to see this.

317
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:24,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think if anybody wants to see it, they can look at it.

318
00:31:24,705 --> 00:31:32,549
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that, as Anthony pointed out, ultimately the charter will supersede any ordinance.

319
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:48,115
[SPEAKER_13]: So I also, I quickly looked at the ordinance and I do think there's probably more in it than, I mean, there's more in it, for instance, than in the example, the article six examples that we've been looking at.

320
00:31:51,528 --> 00:32:05,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I think our job is to look at Article 6 and find out, you know, think about best practices and just try to craft an Article 6 that we think makes the most sense and is the best for the city.

321
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:09,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's pretty much what our task is.

322
00:32:09,616 --> 00:32:10,956
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how I see it anyway.

323
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:14,638
[SPEAKER_13]: And Anthony?

324
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:15,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

325
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:32,333
[SPEAKER_08]: And correct me if I'm wrong, is it possible in Article 6 that we just have a framework that asks that an ordinance be created?

326
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:39,386
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, by the city council and the mayor, you know, for financial processes.

327
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:46,413
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, basically just putting a frame around it and they can fill in the blank.

328
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:50,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah.

329
00:32:51,648 --> 00:33:14,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, kind of, uh, you know, the, this is how it'll, how it'll work, but you know, the city council will create a, an ordinance, you know, for, you know, the actual times and dates and, you know, because they're going to do what, pick the dates and times that they want anyway.

330
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:16,969
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

331
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:21,151
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's maybe something that Anthony and Frank can say if that's common.

332
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:37,618
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think in the Article 6 charter, the examples that we've looked at, the example of charters, they have, you know, they have delineated timelines and dates without saying that there needs to be an ordinance to confirm them.

333
00:33:37,738 --> 00:33:40,439
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but I don't know, Anthony or Frank, what you think.

334
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:47,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just break a chance.

335
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:59,806
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, most charters, I haven't seen any charters that talk about the financial procedures and sort of refer it to an ordinance to lay them out in more detail.

336
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be something I have not seen before.

337
00:34:03,527 --> 00:34:05,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

338
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:06,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Anthony.

339
00:34:06,988 --> 00:34:10,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the charter provision would be broader.

340
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:21,330
[SPEAKER_04]: more general, and then you could fill in any specifics of, you know, any perceived blanks by ordinance.

341
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just ask a question to Anthony and Frank to clarify?

342
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:28,776
[SPEAKER_05]: The charter can be overridden at any point by an ordinance?

343
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:29,776
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

344
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:31,698
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the charter overrides ordinance.

345
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:38,223
[SPEAKER_05]: But if the charter is approved, they cannot create an ordinance that changes the charter?

346
00:34:39,571 --> 00:34:39,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

347
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:40,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

348
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:41,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

349
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:43,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll wait my turn to speak on that.

350
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to clarify.

351
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:45,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

352
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:47,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Aubrey has been waiting.

353
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:49,175
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all aligned.

354
00:34:49,195 --> 00:34:49,635
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all right.

355
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:55,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to ask a similar question to you, Mr. Naran, which was about the interaction between ordinance and charter.

356
00:34:57,418 --> 00:34:58,518
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think he just asked it.

357
00:34:58,538 --> 00:35:07,642
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess my caution is about an ordinance being passed right before a charter is passed, and then that charter will say something very different.

358
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:16,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and then the ordinance that we're talking about will certainly be passed before the charter.

359
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:30,225
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that is a reason, I guess, to look at the ordinance, but I still think that our task remains the same, which is to craft a charter that we think is best for the city.

360
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:33,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette.

361
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:38,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess I wasn't quite sure why we were going back to

362
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:54,868
[SPEAKER_09]: what the city council put out a year ago versus when Phyllis and I went and saw the mayor, the mayor very clearly expressed how she and the city council members had been working together on this budget process.

363
00:35:55,628 --> 00:36:07,656
[SPEAKER_09]: So to me, that would be the starting point, not what the city council put out a year ago when they were trying to, it just doesn't seem to, it seems like it's already,

364
00:36:09,682 --> 00:36:17,527
[SPEAKER_09]: That we need to look at what's what they're doing now and say what piece of that or pieces with that appropriately go into the charter or not.

365
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:19,568
[SPEAKER_13]: So, thanks for that.

366
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:23,130
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the reason is because 1 of it was sort of.

367
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:37,012
[SPEAKER_13]: It was thrown to us as the Charter Study Committee after the city council laid these out and the mayor said, well, the Charter Study Committee is going to study them.

368
00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:40,874
[SPEAKER_13]: And the city council also has recently referred to them.

369
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:46,116
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't think they've forgotten about them, but that's why we're discussing it anyway.

370
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:46,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, OK.

371
00:36:46,816 --> 00:36:48,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then it makes sense to look at both.

372
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:56,369
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing, Milva, I just want to mention that when I went to go look at Article 6, it said I needed permission.

373
00:36:57,802 --> 00:36:59,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I shared it.

374
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:04,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't understand why Google sharing sometimes makes people ask for permission after I share it, but I will.

375
00:37:04,964 --> 00:37:06,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's the same problem.

376
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:23,868
[SPEAKER_09]: The last thing I just wanted to mention is earlier, some time ago, when there was the whole discussion about the budget process and the school committee, the piece that was really left out was that the school committee certainly has a very major role in

377
00:37:25,428 --> 00:37:29,050
[SPEAKER_09]: reviewing and crafting the budget over the years.

378
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:31,071
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been differences.

379
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:38,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Some mayors sort of, you know, basically likes to say here to the superintendent, work, work up to this.

380
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:39,716
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what you've got.

381
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:44,539
[SPEAKER_09]: And over time, the school committee said, no, no, we need to start with what we need.

382
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:51,261
[SPEAKER_09]: and basically start from, let's start at zero and what do we need?

383
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:56,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And that of course then says, well, the first thing we need to do is we need to put in our contracts and whatever.

384
00:37:56,282 --> 00:38:02,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So the piece that was sort of left out was the very, the role of the school committee in the process.

385
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:07,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

386
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, David?

387
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:13,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

388
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:18,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm hearing that this is like a big complicated problem.

389
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes me think that that it might be worth talking about in a subcommittee.

390
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:26,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And having a subcommittee kind of present some options and ideas.

391
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,006
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I'm wondering is.

392
00:38:30,026 --> 00:38:33,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at this article 6 information that you sent out.

393
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:40,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of it is maybe a little bit more straightforward and so maybe we can start.

394
00:38:40,574 --> 00:38:43,716
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we can move this discussion off of the budget, which I think is.

395
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:48,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Big and complicated and important and probably deserve some subcommittee time.

396
00:38:49,156 --> 00:38:58,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And switch to talking about, like, uh, you know, do we want to include something like section 6, 7, which says you're not allowed to spend more money than the city appropriates.

397
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:03,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want something like section 6, 6, which requires an independent audit.

398
00:39:04,046 --> 00:39:07,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of work our way up from the bottom there with, I think, some of these.

399
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:14,376
[SPEAKER_02]: less complicated, more straightforward issues.

400
00:39:15,597 --> 00:39:15,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

401
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:16,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

402
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:18,417
[SPEAKER_13]: We definitely need to decide all those things.

403
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:24,359
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hear you, and maybe we will form a subcommittee.

404
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,819
[SPEAKER_13]: I see some hands.

405
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,260
[SPEAKER_13]: I see Ron has a hand.

406
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,061
[SPEAKER_13]: And Anthony and Aubrey, are your hands up?

407
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:31,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

408
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:32,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Anthony, is your hand up again?

409
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:34,982
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just don't know how to take it down.

410
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:35,542
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Ron?

411
00:39:35,962 --> 00:39:36,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Ron?

412
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:48,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm just going to, as you know, I'm kind of like the calendar guy that wants to make sure we have made a point of attacking all the stuff that's in front of us.

413
00:39:49,890 --> 00:40:01,843
[SPEAKER_05]: The way I understand this budget thing is the frustration that happens on June 30th that causes chaos in the school committee, the city council, and the mayor's office.

414
00:40:02,324 --> 00:40:08,551
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just an inappropriate, non-professional way of how we negotiate, okay, you get this, you get that.

415
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:11,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the root core of what the issue is.

416
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So my understanding is the council wants to set up a schedule.

417
00:40:15,902 --> 00:40:18,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about who's going to have what rights or whatever.

418
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:24,410
[SPEAKER_05]: What they've done is they've set up a schedule that's published in their documents.

419
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:32,177
[SPEAKER_05]: They've also publicly stated, and I really want to strongly emphasize this, that there'll be no collaboration with this organization and the city council.

420
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:39,343
[SPEAKER_05]: If this review board comes up with something that interests them, they will incorporate it.

421
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:41,305
[SPEAKER_05]: But there'll be no collaboration.

422
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:44,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want you to think that we're going to have our plan and their plan.

423
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:46,290
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be two separate plans going forward.

424
00:40:47,637 --> 00:40:52,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually like the calendar, the way it's set up on that site that I sent out to everybody.

425
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:58,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it does is it tells you who should be involved in that process, what timing should be done.

426
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:02,936
[SPEAKER_05]: And it mandates the fact that in April, you're talking about this issue.

427
00:41:03,437 --> 00:41:06,100
[SPEAKER_05]: In May, you've decided on this issue.

428
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:10,491
[SPEAKER_05]: In June, in June, you've talked to the school committee again.

429
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:16,737
[SPEAKER_05]: So on June 30, we're not, you know, one o'clock in the morning negotiating legal fees.

430
00:41:17,378 --> 00:41:22,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just I again, I

431
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:38,834
[SPEAKER_05]: when you all look at the calendar that they have there, it's a very comprehensive calendar, who starts the process, and then they'll have to, they're gonna, whatever we present, they're gonna decide who's the power, what kind of vote, is it a super majority vote that changes a line item?

432
00:41:39,294 --> 00:41:43,215
[SPEAKER_05]: All those things will be done, you know, post our work.

433
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:51,157
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think one of the things that should be our goal is to ensure that this budget process is not something that starts June 15th,

434
00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:53,617
[SPEAKER_05]: and ends in June 30th.

435
00:41:53,697 --> 00:42:02,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a process that should involve school committee, city council, and the mayor's office up front in January, which is when this calendar starts.

436
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:13,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just, I don't want to repeat myself, but I just think the reality is this is not something that's going to be, you know, this is what we've come up with.

437
00:42:14,402 --> 00:42:15,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Here are the details.

438
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:21,505
[SPEAKER_05]: If we go into subcommittee, which I suggest we would do if we don't want to, you know, keep a simple ruling.

439
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:26,327
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly, the reason why I asked about ordinances, we're here to write the charter.

440
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:30,488
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll write the ordinances, but they can't change what we write.

441
00:42:30,868 --> 00:42:32,229
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're going to end up approving it.

442
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:35,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want the reality of the process to be out there.

443
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:36,150
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

444
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:36,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Ron.

445
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:42,533
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to clarify, when you say calendar, you're referring to the ordinance that's under discussion right now.

446
00:42:45,587 --> 00:42:46,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to clarify that.

447
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Can Ron share what he's talking about?

448
00:42:48,912 --> 00:42:49,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm a little bit confused.

449
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure he's talking about the ordinance.

450
00:42:52,357 --> 00:42:56,402
[SPEAKER_05]: No, what they're talking about is a charter review that will start in April.

451
00:42:56,422 --> 00:43:00,348
[SPEAKER_05]: The governance committee will start a charter review process.

452
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:03,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but that's not okay.

453
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:05,234
[SPEAKER_13]: So you weren't talking about the timing.

454
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:19,982
[SPEAKER_05]: No I'm talking about a subcommittee of the city council will form to do a charter study review and when asked about this charter study review it was stated that we will not

455
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:27,905
[SPEAKER_05]: be collaborating, they'll do a separate study on whatever they want to do subsequent to what we are going to be doing.

456
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:28,685
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm saying.

457
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:29,606
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to happen.

458
00:43:29,986 --> 00:43:34,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly, this is one of the major issues that they will do.

459
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just duplication of effort, just

460
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:40,812
[SPEAKER_13]: So it remains to be seen exactly what they'll do this spring.

461
00:43:41,553 --> 00:43:45,858
[SPEAKER_13]: But regardless of that, our job, it doesn't really change our job.

462
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:58,390
[SPEAKER_13]: So I mean, I guess we just it maybe gives us a little more impetus to just stay focused and and keep on task and get our final report done by by the target date of October.

463
00:43:58,551 --> 00:43:58,971
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's

464
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:02,095
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and my point is the calendar, to me, looks very good.

465
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:14,851
[SPEAKER_05]: The calendar that's published looks like it's a common-sense approach, and Paulette, who's been involved in the process, would look at that and say, that's a very common-sense approach that should eliminate the June 30th chaos.

466
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:16,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like it.

467
00:44:17,026 --> 00:44:22,447
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, when you say calendar, you're talking about the dates that are laid out in the budget ordinance.

468
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:25,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about what they want to do.

469
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:35,951
[SPEAKER_05]: What I sent out to everybody is their proposed budget plan, which is January, the mayor, the council, the staff, residents work together to develop a budget.

470
00:44:36,471 --> 00:44:40,172
[SPEAKER_05]: In February, the school committee discusses the needs and budget recommendations.

471
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,853
[SPEAKER_05]: In March, the council submits recommendations.

472
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:46,014
[SPEAKER_05]: In April, the mayor submits budget by mid-May.

473
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:58,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Council holds budget review meetings and this details little details in here too and in june council approves amends or rejects the budget by mid-june So those that's that's kind of you know, that's kind of a nice thing.

474
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:00,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I I I think that's a really

475
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,240
[SPEAKER_05]: How they get to that point, I don't know.

476
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:13,363
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like the fact that I think in our charter, we should incorporate this calendar because it forces the fact that we're talking budget for six months versus... Okay.

477
00:45:13,383 --> 00:45:20,125
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's one of the things that we need to look at is what are best practices around those kinds of dates and those kinds of gatherings.

478
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:21,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Aubrey?

479
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:31,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Just another clarification question around once, I think you said that once a charter is passed, an ordinance cannot supersede what's in it.

480
00:45:31,756 --> 00:45:32,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

481
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:36,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anything exist that can change what is in a charter?

482
00:45:38,578 --> 00:45:45,880
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the other issues that we have to discuss eventually, which is procedures for amending the charter, which will be part of the charter.

483
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:57,278
[SPEAKER_13]: What we can put in the charter is how often a charter review will take place, but I don't think we can change how the charter is amended or changed.

484
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,419
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty set out, right?

485
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:04,901
[SPEAKER_04]: You would do that by a home rule petition to the legislature.

486
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:09,183
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it through a special act, which is

487
00:46:10,908 --> 00:46:17,654
[SPEAKER_04]: initiated as a home rule petition, which the city council passes and the mayor has to sign.

488
00:46:18,815 --> 00:46:22,918
[SPEAKER_04]: They cannot override a mayor's unwillingness to sign.

489
00:46:22,978 --> 00:46:28,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like an ordinance where they can override a mayor's veto or pocket veto.

490
00:46:29,904 --> 00:46:38,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Both the city council and the mayor can sign a home rule petition, which goes to the legislature, which if passed and signed by the governor,

491
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:48,287
[SPEAKER_04]: becomes a home rule amendment and is published as a special act, and that can amend the charter.

492
00:46:49,388 --> 00:46:53,249
[SPEAKER_13]: But that option is available whether or not we put that in the charter, correct?

493
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:57,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's state law, yes.

494
00:46:58,072 --> 00:47:05,175
[SPEAKER_11]: My preference for language in the charter will be probably more vague than we'd like and more evergreen as possible.

495
00:47:05,688 --> 00:47:05,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

496
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:11,836
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, regular charter review, for instance, is one of the things that we'll consider putting up.

497
00:47:12,156 --> 00:47:12,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

498
00:47:13,057 --> 00:47:20,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Gene and Anthony, and then I just want to get back and just see where everybody stands on the topic that we started with.

499
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:21,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Gene.

500
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:29,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to confirm the process for the charter, because I'm confused by the way we talk about it.

501
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:37,025
[SPEAKER_01]: When we finish and make our report in October, it will be to City Council, right?

502
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:39,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And City Council then can amend

503
00:47:40,755 --> 00:47:42,416
[SPEAKER_01]: what we put before them.

504
00:47:42,516 --> 00:47:52,321
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by them having a charter committee, we will propose something to them, they can amend it, and then it goes to the mayor, right?

505
00:47:52,921 --> 00:47:57,023
[SPEAKER_01]: So city council will have a say in this charter, no matter what.

506
00:47:57,423 --> 00:47:58,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanna confirm that.

507
00:47:59,384 --> 00:48:00,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, okay.

508
00:48:01,705 --> 00:48:01,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

509
00:48:03,226 --> 00:48:03,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Anthony.

510
00:48:04,526 --> 00:48:08,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Not what the city council is saying that they,

511
00:48:12,804 --> 00:48:19,668
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not even considering that we are rewriting a complete charter.

512
00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:36,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if they're just ignoring that or if they're just going to dismiss it out of hand, but they indicated that they're not expecting to vote our charter.

513
00:48:38,038 --> 00:48:41,442
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that they will look at our report seriously.

514
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:48,311
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that they are aware that they have the ability to change it.

515
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:53,397
[SPEAKER_13]: But I also think they will take our report seriously.

516
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:55,780
[SPEAKER_13]: That is my impression.

517
00:49:00,455 --> 00:49:10,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, just to go back to what we started with, I just wanted, because it was sort of we were asked to look at the amendments, I just want to go back to the initial amendment.

518
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:28,996
[SPEAKER_13]: We've talked about a lot of things in relationship to the amendment, but what do people, where are people at in terms of the giving the city council the power to move money in the budget, which is what essentially the core of that.

519
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:33,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I say something?

520
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:45,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I just like to say that, you know, there's a reason that no city or town in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts besides Boston has the ability to do that.

521
00:49:45,784 --> 00:49:59,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And that it's, it's, it's, I think it's irresponsible of us to kind of even entertain that without doing a lot of research and

522
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:10,195
[SPEAKER_08]: and really looking at and seeing what issues and problems with the process the past two years.

523
00:50:10,855 --> 00:50:26,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really think that, you know, just given some of the current events, kind of one, you know, when the city council can, you know, override a mayor and the executive,

524
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:46,114
[SPEAKER_08]: in the budget, it's really a huge change for a community like Medford, especially kind of given the financial situation Medford's in right now to kind of, to do this would be irresponsible.

525
00:50:47,035 --> 00:50:48,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thanks, Anthony.

526
00:50:48,816 --> 00:50:49,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Daveed?

527
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:52,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

528
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:57,826
[SPEAKER_02]: For 1 thing, I just want to say, I agree with Ron, I think, on a lot of levels.

529
00:50:57,966 --> 00:51:02,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the process that the city council is considering for the budget is 1.

530
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to see how it works.

531
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:08,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine it won't be perfect the 1st time through.

532
00:51:08,334 --> 00:51:10,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we should be thoughtful about.

533
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:14,860
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of it we kind of put in the charter and and.

534
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,904
[SPEAKER_02]: From my perspective, I think the.

535
00:51:21,565 --> 00:51:26,548
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I can see very good reasons why we might give the city council more budget power.

536
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:30,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I can also see that in a state where that's far out of the norm.

537
00:51:30,449 --> 00:51:32,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we probably want to take that step.

538
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:39,634
[SPEAKER_02]: In my view, a really important thing the charter could do in this section is.

539
00:51:40,074 --> 00:51:46,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Is set some really powerful rules regarding transparency.

540
00:51:47,146 --> 00:52:01,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think that's a place where, uh, you know, the, the, the thing that the city council is working through with the mayor right now says X and Y are going to meet on this date or in this month and start talking about this thing.

541
00:52:01,097 --> 00:52:04,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's a bit of a weird thing to put in a charter.

542
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:14,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I think it could be very reasonable to say, you know, on January 15th, the mayor, the city council, whoever has to release this information to the public.

543
00:52:15,593 --> 00:52:30,760
[SPEAKER_02]: right, which I think by necessity will kickstart these conversations and by necessity will avoid that kind of, what is it, July 15th to July 30th frantic scrambling of trying to figure things out, right?

544
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:44,687
[SPEAKER_02]: If we say, hey, you know, the mayor has to, like, send out a skeletonized version of the budget or something by May 1st, I don't know that that's actually exactly the day, exactly the type of thing we'd ask for.

545
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:51,007
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think those types of transparency things could be a really powerful thing to include in the charter.

546
00:52:52,767 --> 00:53:08,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I think when we look at those, we'll have to sort of maybe do it in collaboration with what other cities do and maybe how realistic they are in terms of what, you know, what the finance department can provide when, but for sure.

547
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:09,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Eunice.

548
00:53:11,653 --> 00:53:15,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think I agree with what Anthony's saying.

549
00:53:15,556 --> 00:53:37,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the fact that Boston is the only city that allows the council to move money around, either they're a complete trendsetter or there's something to the fact that the other 350 cities and towns don't do this.

550
00:53:37,974 --> 00:53:41,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we either have to reject it out of hand

551
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:52,638
[SPEAKER_07]: or do a whole lot of thoughtful consideration and research in order to determine if that's what we want to do.

552
00:53:54,258 --> 00:54:05,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's certainly great to be on the forefront or the cutting edge of something and maybe other communities will follow.

553
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:08,442
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think

554
00:54:09,736 --> 00:54:19,984
[SPEAKER_07]: if we were to go that direction, I, I, I just, I don't think it's something that we can just, you know, decide to put it in a charter after, you know, one or two meetings.

555
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:29,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think, and, uh, and of course, listening to our call and center colleagues as well, um, you know, and heating, um, any advice that they would give.

556
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:38,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I, I think it's something that either, you know, we, we say no, no to right up front or,

557
00:54:38,954 --> 00:54:45,329
[SPEAKER_07]: we take the time to do a whole lot of digging before we get there, because there's a reason 350 cities don't do this.

558
00:54:47,353 --> 00:54:48,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Eunice.

559
00:54:48,756 --> 00:54:49,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Paulette?

560
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just wanted to ask one question.

561
00:54:53,663 --> 00:55:09,874
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, from my experience, you can start the budget process early and certainly put out all your questions and listen to your administrative people about their needs and whatever, but there was always something else that needed to happen.

562
00:55:09,914 --> 00:55:15,558
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was when we learned what the appropriation would be from the state.

563
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:30,701
[SPEAKER_09]: And so up until that point of when that number was known, everything, you know, to when people sort of say, you know, we want to pack this away earlier and more calmly and all the rest of it.

564
00:55:31,601 --> 00:55:33,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's true until you know that appropriation.

565
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:52,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And when that appropriation comes, and sometimes it's been quite late, all of a sudden that's when the scramble comes, because you're trying to figure out, of course, you want more, you've put in more, and now all of a sudden reality is struck and you have to make cuts.

566
00:55:52,406 --> 00:55:54,986
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's always the most difficult part in my experience.

567
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:57,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the Cherry Sheets poet?

568
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:57,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

569
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that Chapter 70 funding or Chapter 90?

570
00:56:02,627 --> 00:56:08,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what the chapter and verse are, but I just remember that being a really critical piece.

571
00:56:08,909 --> 00:56:11,609
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm certainly not trying to argue we should let it go.

572
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:24,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, as I was on the school committee, it started earlier and earlier, very much because the school committee wanted to make sure that we had out all of our needs.

573
00:56:25,453 --> 00:56:29,215
[SPEAKER_09]: and weren't just responding to the appropriation.

574
00:56:29,915 --> 00:56:31,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, we wanted to be out there.

575
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:37,658
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the other hand, we also had to, once the appropriation is in, that certainly can upend.

576
00:56:38,618 --> 00:56:39,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Depending if it's good, it's great.

577
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:43,020
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's low, it's very difficult.

578
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:46,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't quite remember.

579
00:56:46,381 --> 00:56:50,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember appropriations differing from year to year of when we finally found out.

580
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:54,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to throw out that piece.

581
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:54,894
[SPEAKER_13]: No, thank you.

582
00:56:54,914 --> 00:56:56,515
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really important information.

583
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:58,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Ron.

584
00:56:58,857 --> 00:57:03,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know I've used up all my time, but I just want to say two things.

585
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,843
[SPEAKER_05]: One is I agree with what Paula just said.

586
00:57:05,863 --> 00:57:07,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with what David has said.

587
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:10,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And Anthony's right.

588
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:14,749
[SPEAKER_05]: The only power of the city council, and I've watched budget deliberations for

589
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:23,451
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 years, it always comes down to the last hour, and the only power the city council has is to not approve.

590
00:57:23,972 --> 00:57:29,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they don't approve in 15 days or 20 days, it automatically goes back, reverts back to last year's budget.

591
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:31,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's that pressure.

592
00:57:31,553 --> 00:57:42,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the best thing we can do is go to the root cause of all these problems, and that's to start forcing the conversation in public, transparent ways in January.

593
00:57:43,555 --> 00:57:52,179
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever the cherry sheets say, at least everybody has an understanding of how to adapt, and there's no wildness going on.

594
00:57:52,259 --> 00:58:05,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And it happens every year, where the last hour of the last minute of the last day, and the city council is hands, all they can do is not approve, knowing that last year's budget would automatically roll in in 15 days.

595
00:58:05,624 --> 00:58:06,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my point.

596
00:58:06,705 --> 00:58:08,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think we need to force a calendar.

597
00:58:08,345 --> 00:58:09,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the most important thing we can do.

598
00:58:10,392 --> 00:58:27,210
[SPEAKER_13]: So, can I ask, um, I know Anthony and Frank, I see in article six, a couple of the charters that you gave us have something called an annual budget meeting, um, which, which included the city council mayor and school committee and, um,

599
00:58:28,891 --> 00:58:33,134
[SPEAKER_13]: That wasn't maybe necessarily not public, but I suppose it could be public.

600
00:58:34,335 --> 00:58:39,639
[SPEAKER_13]: What is Melrose specified only before the commencement of the budget process?

601
00:58:39,739 --> 00:58:43,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Pittsfield said at least 60 days before the start of the fiscal year.

602
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:47,864
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, do cities, are there cities that start this kind of thing in January?

603
00:58:47,884 --> 00:58:49,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a reasonable?

604
00:58:52,848 --> 00:58:55,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I hesitate to say it's a trend only because

605
00:58:56,528 --> 00:59:05,975
[SPEAKER_03]: We're involved in a lot of these processes, a lot of questions in terms of concerns about, you know, the rush to finish the budget in time before the window closed.

606
00:59:06,315 --> 00:59:17,403
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that we hear very commonly in communities, as well as the frustration about for the city council and the mayor really having sort of that driver's seat about creating the budget.

607
00:59:20,243 --> 00:59:37,729
[SPEAKER_03]: We there are a number of charters around the state that where I think crafted by us in response to those concerns about putting those parties in the room together earlier in the process as early as January or even before that.

608
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:44,752
[SPEAKER_03]: For the the up and coming fiscal year's budget around sort of what we said that that budget meeting is really about.

609
00:59:47,893 --> 00:59:51,376
[SPEAKER_03]: discussing priorities and looking at projections for what is expected.

610
00:59:51,617 --> 01:00:08,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a very good point about the state funding, which varies significant from year to year when the state finally puts its budget out, which affects really every municipality across the state in terms of the amount of money they will have in their coffers when their fiscal year starts.

611
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:11,834
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn it over to Frank if he has anything to add.

612
01:00:13,665 --> 01:00:26,452
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I would add, I think, is that you have to keep in mind that a budget is not static, that the budget is a fluid document.

613
01:00:26,712 --> 01:00:34,036
[SPEAKER_04]: The budget is essentially a snapshot of what you think you're going to need in the next year, next fiscal year.

614
01:00:38,111 --> 01:00:49,894
[SPEAKER_04]: My experience is discussions that start early, say January, which is halfway through the fiscal year, are an analysis of how that fiscal year's budget is going.

615
01:00:51,634 --> 01:00:53,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we meeting our needs?

616
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:54,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a surplus?

617
01:00:55,895 --> 01:01:05,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a projection as to where things will go into the next fiscal year, the next budget, generally.

618
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:17,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you meet, as the year goes along, the fifth year goes along to its conclusion towards June, you can obviously get more specific.

619
01:01:18,146 --> 01:01:23,509
[SPEAKER_04]: So the earlier the meeting, I think the less specific you're going to get.

620
01:01:24,509 --> 01:01:33,874
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't expect a lot of detail beyond what's been spent and what projects, where things stand, but the,

621
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:54,030
[SPEAKER_04]: detail as to what funds are needed, what funds have been spent for the current fiscal year, needed for the next fiscal year, and what the administration is proposing for spending in the next year become clearer and clearer as you approach.

622
01:01:54,371 --> 01:02:03,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how realistic it is to have an expectation of getting a clear picture in January

623
01:02:04,396 --> 01:02:05,097
[SPEAKER_04]: or February.

624
01:02:05,897 --> 01:02:07,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably changes from year to year.

625
01:02:07,678 --> 01:02:08,199
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends.

626
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:10,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, things change.

627
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Fiscally, things change.

628
01:02:11,681 --> 01:02:14,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Project-wise, goals, et cetera.

629
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:23,930
[SPEAKER_04]: But so that's why I think a charter, you want to be careful about being too, too specific in a charter because things are fluid.

630
01:02:25,631 --> 01:02:28,573
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess those would be my comments at this point.

631
01:02:29,274 --> 01:02:29,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

632
01:02:31,035 --> 01:02:33,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Anthony Wilson, can I ask?

633
01:02:34,915 --> 01:02:44,544
[SPEAKER_13]: The charters that you mentioned that you had helped craft specifically addressing some of these budget needs, we have from you Weymouth, Pittsfield, and Melrose.

634
01:02:44,584 --> 01:02:45,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you include those in that?

635
01:02:46,185 --> 01:02:50,649
[SPEAKER_13]: And if not, can we all be referred to the charters that you mentioned?

636
01:02:52,983 --> 01:02:57,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the ones that I said, I know, I know for a fact, Pittsfields is 60 days before a budget.

637
01:02:57,687 --> 01:02:58,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget.

638
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Melrose, I think they all might be the same.

639
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might be either 60 or 90 days.

640
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:05,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel the 60.

641
01:03:05,353 --> 01:03:06,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think.

642
01:03:06,454 --> 01:03:06,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

643
01:03:08,657 --> 01:03:09,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead, sorry, go ahead.

644
01:03:09,918 --> 01:03:16,962
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think between 60 and 90 is, 60 and 90 before, you know, the fiscal year, which is, you know, July 1st of that year.

645
01:03:17,362 --> 01:03:21,244
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's probably where most of the charges we worked on have been in.

646
01:03:21,284 --> 01:03:25,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there've been a few where they go further, sort of further back.

647
01:03:26,507 --> 01:03:38,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Frank's point is very well taken in terms of the resolution on what, you know, being able to know what the future holds, sort of, you know, it dims.

648
01:03:39,778 --> 01:03:54,366
[SPEAKER_04]: The recollection in Somerville was that the meeting, it wasn't by charter, but the city council and the mayor's office had agreed that they would meet in March.

649
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hold me to that, but that's my recollection.

650
01:03:58,048 --> 01:04:00,409
[SPEAKER_13]: The fiscal year starts July 1st, is that?

651
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:02,430
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

652
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:03,130
[SPEAKER_12]: July, yes.

653
01:04:04,587 --> 01:04:04,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

654
01:04:06,568 --> 01:04:12,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so I think, Anthony, did you, does your, Anthony Andreottola, is your hand up?

655
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,850
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's just there.

656
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:27,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so it seems like maybe just to explore, there's, what I hear anyway is that we have a strong interest in being able to craft a timeline that addresses transparency,

657
01:04:29,515 --> 01:04:40,160
[SPEAKER_13]: collaboration, but we also want to make sure that it falls into best practices and that it's actually doable and reasonable.

658
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:45,023
[SPEAKER_13]: I also hear interest in forming a subcommittee to do that.

659
01:04:45,223 --> 01:04:56,008
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to go ahead and do that, but before that, I want to just see if we want to continue to consider the amendment that would allow the city council to move money.

660
01:04:56,108 --> 01:04:57,469
[SPEAKER_13]: So far, I haven't heard

661
01:04:59,037 --> 01:05:00,778
[SPEAKER_13]: people speaking in favor of it?

662
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:14,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we want to just focus on what's in article six and say, you know, we don't feel comfortable including that in the charter for the various reasons that have been expressed?

663
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:18,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Or do we, I haven't heard any motions, for instance.

664
01:05:19,473 --> 01:05:25,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm happy to make a motion to reject the idea of the city council moving money around.

665
01:05:25,877 --> 01:05:26,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

666
01:05:27,743 --> 01:05:29,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll go ahead and make that motion.

667
01:05:29,644 --> 01:05:29,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

668
01:05:29,985 --> 01:05:31,025
[SPEAKER_13]: I second it.

669
01:05:31,766 --> 01:05:32,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

670
01:05:32,686 --> 01:05:33,407
[SPEAKER_13]: All in favor?

671
01:05:34,407 --> 01:05:35,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

672
01:05:35,608 --> 01:05:36,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Should we do a roll call?

673
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:37,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

674
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:37,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

675
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:38,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

676
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:40,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Anthony Andreadola.

677
01:05:43,433 --> 01:05:49,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Voting yes means that we are giving the city council power to move money in the budget.

678
01:05:49,797 --> 01:05:49,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

679
01:05:50,678 --> 01:05:51,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

680
01:05:52,539 --> 01:05:53,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Eunice.

681
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

682
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:56,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Maury.

683
01:05:57,062 --> 01:05:57,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

684
01:05:58,855 --> 01:05:59,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Paulette.

685
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,937
[SPEAKER_13]: You're on mute, Paulette.

686
01:06:04,577 --> 01:06:06,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

687
01:06:06,618 --> 01:06:07,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Aubrey.

688
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:07,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

689
01:06:08,619 --> 01:06:09,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean.

690
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

691
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in it, but I think it's too much for us right now.

692
01:06:15,302 --> 01:06:15,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

693
01:06:15,762 --> 01:06:16,182
[SPEAKER_12]: David.

694
01:06:18,923 --> 01:06:19,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

695
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:20,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Phyllis.

696
01:06:21,164 --> 01:06:21,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

697
01:06:22,304 --> 01:06:22,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Ron.

698
01:06:23,445 --> 01:06:23,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

699
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:30,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Danielle was here, but it looks like she must have dropped off.

700
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:32,332
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

701
01:06:32,633 --> 01:06:33,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

702
01:06:33,613 --> 01:06:34,614
[SPEAKER_13]: I will also vote yes.

703
01:06:34,994 --> 01:06:35,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

704
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:35,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

705
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:37,816
[SPEAKER_13]: That's taken care of.

706
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:45,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, in terms of the subcommittee, are there people who want to be on this article six subcommittee?

707
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:48,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope.

708
01:06:49,563 --> 01:06:50,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Maury, yes?

709
01:06:50,804 --> 01:06:51,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

710
01:06:52,445 --> 01:06:52,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

711
01:06:55,027 --> 01:06:57,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Anybody else?

712
01:06:57,749 --> 01:06:58,129
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll do it.

713
01:06:58,849 --> 01:06:59,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Jean?

714
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:04,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Against my better judgment, because I'm on two others, I'll go for yes as well.

715
01:07:07,053 --> 01:07:07,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

716
01:07:07,614 --> 01:07:12,056
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have Maury, Jean, Eunice, and I will also do it.

717
01:07:12,116 --> 01:07:13,157
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's four of us.

718
01:07:15,618 --> 01:07:19,160
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we will do is we will start meeting and we will

719
01:07:22,045 --> 01:07:26,590
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I think we have pretty good guidelines with the charters we have.

720
01:07:27,932 --> 01:07:33,538
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can sort of look at the timelines and we'll bring something back.

721
01:07:35,145 --> 01:07:56,074
[SPEAKER_13]: And if there's, if anybody, I'm going to assume, and Anthony and Frank, you can say if this doesn't seem right, I'm going to assume that what's contained in those charters you gave us are reasonable practices in terms of, let's say, if we pick a timeline that's outlined in one of those charters, that that's probably going to be workable.

722
01:07:59,516 --> 01:08:02,297
[SPEAKER_13]: But is that, or would that vary from city to city?

723
01:08:03,842 --> 01:08:06,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say it probably varies from city to city.

724
01:08:07,064 --> 01:08:12,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that those are probably within the average of what places are doing.

725
01:08:13,378 --> 01:08:30,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so one of the things that we would maybe, would you recommend that the subcommittee, if we say, okay, this is the timeline that we want to propose for an annual budget meeting, for submission of budget, that it would be wise to check with the financial department?

726
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:41,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Or would, I mean, how would you recommend handling making sure that what we recommend is consistent with what is doable in Medford?

727
01:08:43,395 --> 01:08:50,659
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could, Anthony, I mean, additionally, I'd say they're reasonable from the perspective of the legislature, because they approve them.

728
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:51,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

729
01:08:51,659 --> 01:09:07,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, as far as whether it's reasonable in a particular municipality, I think because the executive runs the municipality on a day-to-day basis, that you do need the executive

730
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:20,182
[SPEAKER_04]: and I assume the executive want the finance director's input as to whether or not what's being proposed is workable.

731
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:22,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.

732
01:09:23,883 --> 01:09:30,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that can be taken into consideration before the city council.

733
01:09:31,145 --> 01:09:32,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

734
01:09:32,445 --> 01:09:33,085
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds good.

735
01:09:34,243 --> 01:09:35,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

736
01:09:36,044 --> 01:09:37,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Eunice, did you have another comment?

737
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:41,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, we two things.

738
01:09:41,246 --> 01:09:54,532
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, I think when we get to subcommittee, you know, we should be looking at, you know, not only what we've got, but we should definitely have in front of us copies of the amendment and copies of the ordinance as well.

739
01:09:55,133 --> 01:09:59,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So that we can be looking at all of that.

740
01:09:59,595 --> 01:09:59,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

741
01:10:01,598 --> 01:10:13,265
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll, if we need to inquire of the finance department, um, or any other entity, are we going to get cooperation from them?

742
01:10:13,365 --> 01:10:21,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know that the finance director has been in front of the city council, you know, for this ordinance a half a dozen times now.

743
01:10:22,069 --> 01:10:22,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um,

744
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:26,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he going to think, well, I've answered all these questions.

745
01:10:28,535 --> 01:10:31,278
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, why it again with another.

746
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:34,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Entity another body and who do I answer to?

747
01:10:35,743 --> 01:10:41,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think we'll maybe talk about that when we get in subcommittee, see what we come up with if.

748
01:10:42,827 --> 01:10:51,293
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and I think the chief of staff has always been with the chief financial officer when they've pretty much meetings.

749
01:10:51,854 --> 01:11:04,323
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe it would be just something that we could run by the chief of staff, who I think would be aware of, you know, whether this was something that, you know, they that they looked at.

750
01:11:05,364 --> 01:11:07,185
[SPEAKER_13]: So but we can we can figure that out.

751
01:11:07,205 --> 01:11:07,965
[SPEAKER_13]: We can talk about it.

752
01:11:08,446 --> 01:11:08,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

753
01:11:09,367 --> 01:11:09,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Aubrey.

754
01:11:12,162 --> 01:11:13,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a question about the document itself.

755
01:11:15,043 --> 01:11:18,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it colored by town?

756
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,385
[SPEAKER_11]: So Melrose is brown, Pittsfield is green, and Weymouth is purple.

757
01:11:21,465 --> 01:11:23,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything in purple is from Weymouth?

758
01:11:23,586 --> 01:11:38,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so for that Article 6 document is, yeah, where I included the text from each of those towns' charters under each section, and they are color-coded in that way, yes.

759
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:44,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

760
01:11:46,086 --> 01:11:51,670
[SPEAKER_13]: We also were going to talk about the draft of Articles 2 and 3.

761
01:11:53,111 --> 01:11:55,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Did people have a chance to look at it?

762
01:11:55,593 --> 01:11:58,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any concerns or questions?

763
01:11:58,535 --> 01:12:06,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of it we've already voted on, and those parts are in green, but are there any concerns or questions about the rest, anything else?

764
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:18,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice has her hand raised.

765
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that your hand or is that an old hand, Eunice?

766
01:12:20,902 --> 01:12:21,743
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's a new hand.

767
01:12:22,244 --> 01:12:22,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

768
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:23,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

769
01:12:23,326 --> 01:12:24,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead then.

770
01:12:24,368 --> 01:12:25,510
[SPEAKER_07]: The right hand is talking to the left.

771
01:12:27,445 --> 01:12:30,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I have questions, but I mean, looking at what.

772
01:12:31,628 --> 01:12:38,272
[SPEAKER_07]: What you put forth, which is a great start and looking at your little color coded thing here.

773
01:12:39,293 --> 01:12:47,799
[SPEAKER_07]: With black being subcommittee reviewed green being language by the full committee and blue language that warrants further investigation.

774
01:12:51,053 --> 01:12:59,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's only a couple of sections here where it seems to be green, which is stuff that we've all- That we voted on.

775
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

776
01:13:01,401 --> 01:13:08,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Me personally, I really feel like, and I know it's time-consuming, but I really feel like we need to go through this bit by bit.

777
01:13:10,068 --> 01:13:11,129
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean with the whole committee?

778
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:14,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of, yeah.

779
01:13:14,372 --> 01:13:16,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to have to say that.

780
01:13:16,834 --> 01:13:17,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

781
01:13:17,194 --> 01:13:19,496
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of black and a lot of blue here.

782
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:23,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, I thought we got rid of all the blue that last meeting.

783
01:13:24,782 --> 01:13:25,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there still blue there?

784
01:13:25,722 --> 01:13:30,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, blue is language that warrants by the full committee.

785
01:13:30,605 --> 01:13:35,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I thought we looked at the blue last meeting and put it in black.

786
01:13:35,907 --> 01:13:40,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe I printed mine out, and I printed it out a while ago.

787
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:44,811
[SPEAKER_02]: The only remaining blue I see is section 3.1.

788
01:13:44,851 --> 01:13:46,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what?

789
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:54,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's mayor qualifications, appointment, term of office, compensation, and prohibitions.

790
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I should actually remove the word appointment.

791
01:13:58,779 --> 01:14:00,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So the one bit that remains in blue.

792
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I can share my screen.

793
01:14:02,381 --> 01:14:07,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that'll be I think I have to give you the Oh, I see it.

794
01:14:07,323 --> 01:14:08,544
[SPEAKER_13]: I see the prohibitions.

795
01:14:08,804 --> 01:14:09,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

796
01:14:10,165 --> 01:14:11,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, let's just take a look at that.

797
01:14:12,206 --> 01:14:13,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I have it up here.

798
01:14:13,026 --> 01:14:16,328
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good place to start our discussion.

799
01:14:16,348 --> 01:14:16,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

800
01:14:17,608 --> 01:14:17,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Eunice.

801
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:21,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering when you say go through it as a group.

802
01:14:21,965 --> 01:14:28,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the idea that we had as a committee was like, we've given people, I think, almost 2 months now to read this.

803
01:14:28,906 --> 01:14:29,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

804
01:14:29,747 --> 01:14:33,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the hope was that, like, people would find things that were.

805
01:14:34,127 --> 01:14:39,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Objectionable confusing, interesting and could ask questions and if not, I think we could just move to an up and down vote.

806
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:44,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, well, I guess otherwise I think we could take.

807
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:47,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Committee time and, like, you know, read it out loud or.

808
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:51,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've gone through it by section, but.

809
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:57,416
[SPEAKER_07]: notated almost section by section questions and things like that.

810
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:57,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

811
01:14:57,857 --> 01:14:59,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we want to hear those questions.

812
01:15:00,138 --> 01:15:00,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

813
01:15:00,718 --> 01:15:05,280
[SPEAKER_13]: But first, let's look at this blue part and we can try to remember why it's still in blue.

814
01:15:06,641 --> 01:15:12,884
[SPEAKER_13]: The mayor shall hold no other city office or city employment for which a salary or other emolument is payable from the city treasury.

815
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:16,165
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that that's something like that.

816
01:15:16,205 --> 01:15:17,546
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in our current charter.

817
01:15:18,267 --> 01:15:25,271
[SPEAKER_13]: No former mayor shall hold any compensated appointed city office or city employment until one year following the date on which his former mayor's city service is terminated.

818
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you remember why it's in blue, David?

819
01:15:28,433 --> 01:15:35,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's why I think it's in blue because of the... That's why it's blue.

820
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:35,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

821
01:15:39,093 --> 01:15:46,439
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think that probably we'll just have to come back to that if and when we have the vote about the mayor's presence on the school committee.

822
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:46,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

823
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:58,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I can make a note and comment that this, you know, this needs to... Whatever vote we make can exclude this particular subsection.

824
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:00,691
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?

825
01:16:00,751 --> 01:16:01,252
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

826
01:16:02,633 --> 01:16:06,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, because if the mayor is chair of the school committee,

827
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:11,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that count as other employment?

828
01:16:12,561 --> 01:16:15,182
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, I don't know about other employment.

829
01:16:15,262 --> 01:16:17,543
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly counts as another city office.

830
01:16:17,803 --> 01:16:18,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

831
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:21,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would certainly be a violation of this clause.

832
01:16:22,184 --> 01:16:29,766
[SPEAKER_13]: So Anthony and Frank, I'm sure that this text came out, came from charter language that exists.

833
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:37,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this, how do, would this just be something that a city that had the mayor as chair of the school committee not have in their charter?

834
01:16:39,983 --> 01:16:46,886
[SPEAKER_03]: As it relates to the mayor's position on the school committee, I'm not aware of this being an issue in cities that have.

835
01:16:46,926 --> 01:16:48,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen this language before.

836
01:16:49,627 --> 01:16:54,669
[SPEAKER_03]: You may be able to resolve it just by... Accepting the school committee.

837
01:16:54,689 --> 01:16:58,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I can shed a little light.

838
01:17:00,252 --> 01:17:00,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Paula.

839
01:17:01,412 --> 01:17:07,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so long ago, what we received was a stipend.

840
01:17:08,835 --> 01:17:12,418
[SPEAKER_09]: And the mayor also received the stipend.

841
01:17:12,698 --> 01:17:13,859
[SPEAKER_09]: It was 100 bucks a month.

842
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:19,103
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the mayor, as being part of the school committee, also received that.

843
01:17:20,144 --> 01:17:23,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Over time, the state came in and said, oh, you guys can't do it as a stipend.

844
01:17:23,567 --> 01:17:24,908
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to do it as a salary.

845
01:17:25,989 --> 01:17:32,314
[SPEAKER_09]: So the mayor continued, to my knowledge, of receiving that in addition to their mayoral pay.

846
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:44,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that practice is still the same now, though we could check in the budget book to see whether in fact the mayor is receiving that.

847
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:51,092
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that's probably why it exists, is that it was sort of a leftover from a stipend to a salary.

848
01:17:51,693 --> 01:17:59,439
[SPEAKER_09]: So the question is, if you were to say, yep, the mayor should get more money than just his mayor's salary,

849
01:18:00,837 --> 01:18:02,378
[SPEAKER_09]: or her mayor salary, whatever.

850
01:18:03,619 --> 01:18:22,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the mayor's salary is in effect, the mayor's salary plus the school committee's salary, or whether the mayor's salary includes, if the mayor should be a member of the school committee, whether their salary is inclusive of all their duties.

851
01:18:23,433 --> 01:18:29,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the other thing we had talked about at another time was putting together a salary review committee

852
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:36,194
[SPEAKER_09]: to review the salaries, and certainly that might be a consideration.

853
01:18:36,874 --> 01:18:43,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, was this to go into effect, you would essentially be reducing the salary of the mayor.

854
01:18:45,593 --> 01:18:51,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, beyond the fact that I think this says that the mayor can't be on the school committee, right?

855
01:18:51,735 --> 01:18:55,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Because she'll hold no other duties.

856
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:56,817
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not considered a separate.

857
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,618
[SPEAKER_09]: It's considered part of the mayor's duties.

858
01:18:59,098 --> 01:19:00,498
[SPEAKER_09]: She's not a school committee member.

859
01:19:00,558 --> 01:19:01,179
[SPEAKER_09]: She's the mayor.

860
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:02,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

861
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:09,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Anthony and Frank, would this clause preclude a mayor being on the school committee?

862
01:19:09,762 --> 01:19:09,882
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

863
01:19:10,802 --> 01:19:15,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think, you know, this question hasn't really arisen in any of the projects I've been on.

864
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:19,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the understanding is exactly as Paulette laid it out.

865
01:19:20,525 --> 01:19:23,346
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor has a seat on the school committee as the mayor.

866
01:19:23,366 --> 01:19:24,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, gotcha.

867
01:19:25,287 --> 01:19:25,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

868
01:19:26,187 --> 01:19:26,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

869
01:19:27,288 --> 01:19:32,670
[SPEAKER_04]: And the general principle in law is the specific overrides the general.

870
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:36,551
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the mayor is specifically named as a member of the school committee,

871
01:19:37,244 --> 01:19:40,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a general clause that says they shall not hold any other position.

872
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,361
[SPEAKER_04]: then the specific would override the general.

873
01:19:44,381 --> 01:19:49,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's very specifically set up.

874
01:19:49,964 --> 01:19:55,266
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would be in the charter that would say the mayor would be on the school committee if that's what we decide.

875
01:19:56,586 --> 01:19:56,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

876
01:19:57,267 --> 01:19:58,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

877
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:07,951
[SPEAKER_13]: So then I think that this clause would not be a problem, except maybe it would interfere with the salary issue at all?

878
01:20:11,043 --> 01:20:11,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would.

879
01:20:11,864 --> 01:20:16,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to know what other cities do.

880
01:20:16,527 --> 01:20:23,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Do other cities pay the mayor a school committee salary and a mayor salary?

881
01:20:23,912 --> 01:20:27,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what I've heard we're doing in Medford.

882
01:20:27,915 --> 01:20:32,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Some school committee don't pay their school committee members at all.

883
01:20:34,384 --> 01:20:36,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And some pay them more than Medford does.

884
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:40,109
[SPEAKER_09]: It varies greatly, but many school committees are unpaid.

885
01:20:40,209 --> 01:20:40,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

886
01:20:40,649 --> 01:20:55,743
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would like to know if other cities where the mayor sits on the school committee and they pay the school committee, if they get paid for both positions, or if that's just considered part of the mayor's job and part of the mayor's salary.

887
01:20:55,943 --> 01:20:56,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?

888
01:20:57,164 --> 01:20:57,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

889
01:20:58,637 --> 01:21:00,999
[SPEAKER_03]: We can look into that.

890
01:21:01,019 --> 01:21:02,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the answer sitting right here.

891
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe the mayor gets two separate checks.

892
01:21:05,322 --> 01:21:11,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the money might come out of that school committee line item, but the mayor draws one salary.

893
01:21:13,547 --> 01:21:16,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Either way, I think maybe we come back to this.

894
01:21:16,689 --> 01:21:17,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

895
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:18,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Either way.

896
01:21:19,293 --> 01:21:26,077
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we are clear that we can keep this clause in and it's not going to interfere with the mayor being on the school committee.

897
01:21:26,137 --> 01:21:27,477
[SPEAKER_13]: At least we know that.

898
01:21:27,677 --> 01:21:29,178
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have that question answered.

899
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:32,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

900
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:33,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to add one thing.

901
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know that there are some

902
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:39,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just looking through some charters quickly.

903
01:21:40,502 --> 01:21:47,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So this isn't to say that there's a trend, but there are some where there's a line that says, the mayor shall receive no additional compensation for serving as chairperson of the school committee.

904
01:21:48,386 --> 01:21:49,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have some charters.

905
01:21:50,187 --> 01:21:51,348
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can put that in.

906
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:52,868
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

907
01:21:52,888 --> 01:21:55,330
[SPEAKER_03]: That usually goes under the mayor's compensation section.

908
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:56,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

909
01:21:57,111 --> 01:21:57,431
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

910
01:22:00,232 --> 01:22:01,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Maury, you had a call.

911
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:22,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just going to kind of say what Anthony said, but the mayor ends up, under our situation, being the highest paid person on the school committee because the mayor gets the school committee salary plus gets the bump for being the chairperson.

912
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:25,854
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it's set up right now.

913
01:22:27,034 --> 01:22:28,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.

914
01:22:28,154 --> 01:22:29,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the vice chair gets a bump.

915
01:22:30,849 --> 01:22:31,670
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the mayor.

916
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:34,332
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor gets the highest, the vice gets second.

917
01:22:36,393 --> 01:22:38,315
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I have to look into that.

918
01:22:40,737 --> 01:22:42,278
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way it is, I can tell you already.

919
01:22:43,314 --> 01:23:03,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so we'll look into that, but and the salaries come in another part of the charter and we did discuss compensation last meeting, but we didn't specifically discuss because we don't know yet if we're going to, we don't know yet what the recommendation is going to be about the mayor and the school committee.

920
01:23:03,407 --> 01:23:05,349
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll revisit it when we know.

921
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:07,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that make sense?

922
01:23:08,391 --> 01:23:10,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

923
01:23:10,272 --> 01:23:11,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Ron.

924
01:23:13,262 --> 01:23:19,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would like to see the something in there with the recommendation of the compensation review board.

925
01:23:19,509 --> 01:23:21,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the details are.

926
01:23:21,532 --> 01:23:25,897
[SPEAKER_13]: That goes in a different that goes in a different section of the chart.

927
01:23:26,197 --> 01:23:27,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, a different article.

928
01:23:27,879 --> 01:23:29,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because this actually talk.

929
01:23:29,281 --> 01:23:29,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

930
01:23:30,102 --> 01:23:30,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And

931
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:34,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Where does the recall process go?

932
01:23:34,912 --> 01:23:35,732
[SPEAKER_05]: In what section?

933
01:23:36,132 --> 01:23:43,176
[SPEAKER_13]: That's under Article 8, and we're talking, you know, the Article 8 subcommittee is talking about that, so we will get to that.

934
01:23:43,736 --> 01:23:45,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

935
01:23:45,577 --> 01:23:45,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

936
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so Paulette and Eunice have their hands up.

937
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:52,463
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we want- No, not me.

938
01:23:52,984 --> 01:23:53,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

939
01:23:53,924 --> 01:23:54,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Eunice.

940
01:23:55,685 --> 01:23:59,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, as I said, I had a variety of things.

941
01:23:59,848 --> 01:24:04,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get to the executive branch, but I've been to the legislative branch and do have a lot of questions.

942
01:24:04,751 --> 01:24:09,754
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think one of my overarching ones, going right back to section 2.1,

943
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:16,181
[SPEAKER_07]: is the term limits.

944
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:27,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that we voted earlier on that only the mayor would have the three-term limit.

945
01:24:29,013 --> 01:24:30,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm concerned.

946
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:31,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Four terms, yeah.

947
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:32,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Four terms.

948
01:24:35,092 --> 01:24:44,776
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm concerned looking at the survey results, which as they say, the survey said we want term limits.

949
01:24:45,577 --> 01:24:45,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

950
01:24:46,017 --> 01:24:51,599
[SPEAKER_07]: We had 650 people telling us that they want term limits and now we've said no to term limits.

951
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:52,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

952
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:56,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a bit concerned that we're going against what the community wants.

953
01:24:56,621 --> 01:25:01,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it wasn't all 650, but you're right, it was a big majority.

954
01:25:01,384 --> 01:25:04,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I think anecdotally, it's also what you hear out there.

955
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:05,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's right.

956
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:09,891
[SPEAKER_13]: We did talk about this at our, you know, at not the last meeting.

957
01:25:10,031 --> 01:25:14,012
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the meeting before where we decided not to have the term limits for city council.

958
01:25:14,733 --> 01:25:22,615
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't, you know, if we want to reopen the discussion, we can, but as I recall, some of the rationale was, um,

959
01:25:24,555 --> 01:25:35,422
[SPEAKER_13]: we looked at some of the research and there was research specific to legislative bodies that showed that term limits reduce the effectiveness of legislative bodies.

960
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:39,704
[SPEAKER_13]: That was one of the reasons I remember that we decided against it.

961
01:25:40,725 --> 01:25:43,026
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, are you saying you want to reopen that discussion?

962
01:25:43,047 --> 01:25:51,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I fear that once we make all of this public,

963
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:56,413
[SPEAKER_07]: And people start, I don't know how we're going to present this to the public.

964
01:25:56,933 --> 01:26:02,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is going to turn out to be 60 some odd pages in all likelihood.

965
01:26:02,877 --> 01:26:11,402
[SPEAKER_07]: And a smattering of the community will read the 60 pages, but most of the community will look for the cliff notes.

966
01:26:12,383 --> 01:26:19,728
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we say, when we break things down into bite-sized bullets and we

967
01:26:21,669 --> 01:26:28,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Say, you know, however, we put it that it's clear that the legislative branch doesn't have term limits.

968
01:26:29,915 --> 01:26:34,638
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm afraid that a lot of people are going to be like, well, that's what we wanted.

969
01:26:35,179 --> 01:26:37,180
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, how come you guys didn't do that?

970
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:43,345
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't you didn't listen to us and and I think, you know, I'm just a little bit concerned.

971
01:26:44,537 --> 01:26:56,251
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I, I obviously was here and heard and participated in the entire conversation and I think I actually abstained in that vote because I couldn't decide on the fly and.

972
01:26:56,632 --> 01:26:59,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm still, you know.

973
01:27:00,497 --> 01:27:17,761
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of ambivalent, but I'm concerned about what the community is going to think when a good portion of the community has told us that they don't want, that they want term limits and we're not giving them what they want.

974
01:27:19,582 --> 01:27:20,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I understand.

975
01:27:21,922 --> 01:27:25,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Does anybody have any thoughts about that, that they want to add?

976
01:27:25,663 --> 01:27:29,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, I think the thing I'd say is that

977
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:39,772
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, in, in, uh, Republican and representative forms of government, uh, there's what the people want, and then there's what the deciders decide.

978
01:27:40,512 --> 01:27:41,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And those things often differ.

979
01:27:43,053 --> 01:27:47,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I understand that a lot of people want term limits.

980
01:27:47,294 --> 01:27:53,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I've given them a lot of thought, um, and decided in the other direction.

981
01:27:54,476 --> 01:27:57,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, uh,

982
01:27:59,356 --> 01:28:02,418
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things people want that are not super reasonable.

983
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:05,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think term limits fall under that category.

984
01:28:07,262 --> 01:28:12,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to think that if I had a long conversation with everybody who wants term limits, I would convince them of my side.

985
01:28:14,347 --> 01:28:25,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think at the end of the day, there are, it doesn't make sense for this committee to put out something that's kind of against

986
01:28:26,269 --> 01:28:29,790
[SPEAKER_02]: what our conscience demands, what we think is best, what we think is right.

987
01:28:34,312 --> 01:28:41,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we voted on this, and I think it was pretty overwhelming that we felt that it wasn't right to put term limits on city councilors.

988
01:28:43,336 --> 01:28:51,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if you have arguments to add about why to change our mind, that's a conversation, but yeah.

989
01:28:53,884 --> 01:28:54,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I add?

990
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Anthony.

991
01:28:57,185 --> 01:29:00,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we did give them term limits for the mayor.

992
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:06,427
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we are listening to the public in that sense.

993
01:29:06,887 --> 01:29:11,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And the mayor is the executive and has the most power in the city.

994
01:29:11,468 --> 01:29:20,310
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we have another 30-year mayor, the city really becomes kind of a fiefdom at that point.

995
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:22,371
[SPEAKER_08]: So in that sense, we are

996
01:29:24,051 --> 01:29:33,478
[SPEAKER_08]: putting in term limits were limited, you know, the most powerful person, position in the city, you know, to, you know, to a certain length of time.

997
01:29:34,098 --> 01:29:51,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the, and I think term limits for, you know, a mayor, four-year terms make sense, but a city council who has to run every two years, and I think that, I think it's a good compromise.

998
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:54,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you, Jean.

999
01:29:56,072 --> 01:30:02,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think we should explain how we made our decisions because we're not here to just do what the survey says.

1000
01:30:02,755 --> 01:30:12,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a thoughtful process where we looked at research and I think we should tell the public why we made the decision and what their research was that we looked at.

1001
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:18,784
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to remember what all the reasons were for our decisions when we presented.

1002
01:30:19,565 --> 01:30:21,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's exactly right.

1003
01:30:21,286 --> 01:30:36,713
[SPEAKER_13]: And Eunice, I mean, I do think that the final report will be probably longer than most people will read, but maybe what we'll also try to do is, you know, we'll have a bullet point section in the beginning where we'll try to summarize things as succinctly as possible.

1004
01:30:36,793 --> 01:30:40,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe like, I don't know what people would call it, the Cliff Notes version, I don't know.

1005
01:30:40,814 --> 01:30:42,655
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, we'll try to make it accessible.

1006
01:30:42,675 --> 01:30:43,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Executive summary.

1007
01:30:44,056 --> 01:30:47,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we'll try to make it as accessible as possible so that people can see.

1008
01:30:51,330 --> 01:31:17,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, thinking this through a bit, what I'm hoping that I can convey to people, because I think that there is going to be backlash on this, is that you have to look at term limits and term lengths, not only in the here and now, and maybe your

1009
01:31:18,546 --> 01:31:22,067
[SPEAKER_07]: happy with our elected officials now, or maybe you're not.

1010
01:31:22,927 --> 01:31:36,772
[SPEAKER_07]: But whichever side of that fence that you fall on now, maybe you don't like our elected officials and you really want term limits because you can't get them out of here fast enough, or maybe you'll love them.

1011
01:31:37,512 --> 01:31:40,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And why would you want term limits?

1012
01:31:41,593 --> 01:31:43,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you think, oh, they can serve forever.

1013
01:31:43,694 --> 01:31:44,654
[SPEAKER_07]: They're fantastic.

1014
01:31:45,214 --> 01:31:46,655
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to think of a point where

1015
01:31:48,324 --> 01:31:51,946
[SPEAKER_07]: there are elected officials seated that you don't like.

1016
01:31:52,386 --> 01:31:56,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Those that like them now, eventually you're gonna get a bunch that you don't like or vice versa.

1017
01:31:57,728 --> 01:32:04,352
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think term limits has to be, you know, thought of in the broader spectrum.

1018
01:32:04,532 --> 01:32:10,094
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I'm just concerned about what the public's gonna say.

1019
01:32:10,134 --> 01:32:11,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, I understand.

1020
01:32:11,295 --> 01:32:17,438
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, and you know, I do think we have to think through it very carefully, especially in light of that.

1021
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:21,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just say something to that point?

1022
01:32:21,321 --> 01:32:27,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think and I know from watching what all you guys have committed to this process.

1023
01:32:30,846 --> 01:32:36,068
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody has followed what we've been doing and doesn't respect what we're doing, I don't think we can win them over.

1024
01:32:36,168 --> 01:32:39,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've done a thoughtful process in everything we've done.

1025
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:42,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some of the decisions not everybody's happy with,

1026
01:32:43,747 --> 01:32:48,368
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't please everybody, but I really think we did very thought.

1027
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing was rushed through.

1028
01:32:49,768 --> 01:32:53,869
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all thoughtful and everybody had their opinion.

1029
01:32:54,169 --> 01:33:07,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that everybody feels very proud of the work you guys are doing because if anybody wants to complain, you can send them down here to the Cape and we'll have a complaint department down here for them.

1030
01:33:08,531 --> 01:33:09,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Ron.

1031
01:33:09,372 --> 01:33:10,452
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll make them sit in the deck.

1032
01:33:12,213 --> 01:33:12,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1033
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:16,556
[SPEAKER_13]: So back to this Article 2 and 3 draft.

1034
01:33:16,636 --> 01:33:29,084
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think, you know, exactly what Naveed said earlier, the hope is that committee members can read this, review it, and then we can vote on it.

1035
01:33:29,184 --> 01:33:34,347
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why I was asking if there are any particular questions or concerns with any of this text.

1036
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:46,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to say really quick, my plan is like at 825, I'm going to move to approve articles two and three.

1037
01:33:46,585 --> 01:33:48,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love for the next 20 minutes.

1038
01:33:49,106 --> 01:33:51,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Before 825, because we have a couple of other items.

1039
01:33:52,978 --> 01:33:59,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, so, you know, 820, whenever it is before the end of this meeting, I'm hoping we have a vote up or down on it.

1040
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:04,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd love there is 1. there is 1 other blue section or I'm not looking at.

1041
01:34:04,601 --> 01:34:05,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1042
01:34:05,261 --> 01:34:05,741
[SPEAKER_13]: What is it?

1043
01:34:05,862 --> 01:34:06,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Which section?

1044
01:34:07,722 --> 01:34:06,582
3.

1045
01:34:10,223 --> 01:34:15,544
[SPEAKER_05]: 3, 5, where it talks about special meetings of the city council.

1046
01:34:15,744 --> 01:34:18,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did actually vote on that and it should be green.

1047
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:22,814
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember maybe I'm looking at my draft here.

1048
01:34:23,255 --> 01:34:25,037
[SPEAKER_12]: It is still in blue blue.

1049
01:34:25,217 --> 01:34:28,020
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I remember correctly, we voted on it and it should be green.

1050
01:34:28,801 --> 01:34:29,782
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be green.

1051
01:34:30,063 --> 01:34:31,104
[SPEAKER_12]: You think is everybody.

1052
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:31,244
[SPEAKER_02]: But

1053
01:34:35,514 --> 01:34:36,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Melville, I can't read it.

1054
01:34:36,695 --> 01:34:40,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you just read that section to me because I can't read it so fine.

1055
01:34:41,018 --> 01:34:44,341
[SPEAKER_13]: The mayor may call a special meeting of the city council for any purpose.

1056
01:34:44,441 --> 01:34:58,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Noting notice of meeting shall, except in an emergency which shall be designated by the mayor, be delivered at least 48 weekday hours in advance of the time set and shall specify the date, time, and location of the meeting and the purpose for which the meeting is to be held.

1057
01:34:58,893 --> 01:35:04,257
[SPEAKER_13]: A copy of the notice shall be posted immediately or as required by the general laws relative to such a posting.

1058
01:35:05,238 --> 01:35:08,680
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically it just allows the mayor to call a special meeting of the city council.

1059
01:35:09,081 --> 01:35:12,103
[SPEAKER_10]: And has to give 48 hours notice, weekday notice.

1060
01:35:12,183 --> 01:35:12,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1061
01:35:12,663 --> 01:35:19,107
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I remember correctly, Daveed, I mean, we gave city council the ability to call a special meeting, right?

1062
01:35:19,207 --> 01:35:25,652
[SPEAKER_13]: So we, and we talked about how well there's, you know, there may actually be occasion

1063
01:35:27,283 --> 01:35:38,206
[SPEAKER_13]: And we talked about the regularity of the city council meeting anyway, but they do now meet every other week, twice a month, so we felt like this was reasonable.

1064
01:35:39,446 --> 01:35:41,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is very reasonable.

1065
01:35:41,927 --> 01:35:42,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1066
01:35:42,407 --> 01:35:43,147
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my vote.

1067
01:35:43,807 --> 01:35:44,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Move to turn it into green.

1068
01:35:45,048 --> 01:35:45,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Green.

1069
01:35:45,368 --> 01:35:46,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

1070
01:35:48,359 --> 01:36:00,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, we can move to turn that into green and vote on that specifically, but I guess first I want to ask, does everybody feel like they've had enough time to look at this text of these articles?

1071
01:36:01,326 --> 01:36:01,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1072
01:36:02,347 --> 01:36:02,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1073
01:36:03,628 --> 01:36:03,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1074
01:36:03,888 --> 01:36:11,012
[SPEAKER_13]: And do we have any other specific concerns or questions about any aspect of it or objections?

1075
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:17,434
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I went through it, but it seems like there's no appetite for a whole lot of further discussion, so.

1076
01:36:18,195 --> 01:36:23,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if there's a specific aspect that you want to discuss, Eunice, we definitely want to discuss it, so.

1077
01:36:26,241 --> 01:36:27,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever notes you have, share them.

1078
01:36:28,123 --> 01:36:28,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1079
01:36:28,824 --> 01:36:29,164
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1080
01:36:29,204 --> 01:36:30,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then I'll go for it.

1081
01:36:31,686 --> 01:36:39,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So under Section 2.1, eligibility, I'm curious.

1082
01:36:41,831 --> 01:36:43,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Are the Collins folks still with us?

1083
01:36:43,613 --> 01:36:43,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1084
01:36:44,393 --> 01:36:46,315
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, great.

1085
01:36:48,017 --> 01:37:01,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Do any other communities, and well, I found one for each, but I'd be wondering about eligibility of people getting elected.

1086
01:37:01,569 --> 01:37:06,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tossed these things out, and I don't think they're going to be well-received, but I'll toss them out anyway.

1087
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:23,970
[SPEAKER_07]: length of residency in the city, minimum and maximum age, let's see, clean quarry, and a couple of these things I found.

1088
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:37,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going through some different charters the other night because I'm on the school subcommittee as well and I was looking for something and I can't remember what it was now, but I came across a couple of interesting things.

1089
01:37:38,553 --> 01:37:41,403
[SPEAKER_07]: and Everett has a

1090
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:44,891
[SPEAKER_07]: section in their charter.

1091
01:37:45,971 --> 01:37:52,153
[SPEAKER_07]: It's under school committee prohibitions, but I suspect that it could be under any of the branches.

1092
01:37:53,314 --> 01:37:56,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's entitled felony conviction.

1093
01:37:56,735 --> 01:38:09,940
[SPEAKER_07]: And it says any person who has been finally convicted of a state or federal felony shall not be eligible to petition for or serve in any elected or appointed office in the city.

1094
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:25,884
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm wondering if that's something that we should be including in all of our branches so that we are ensuring that we're not employing criminals.

1095
01:38:28,345 --> 01:38:34,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just say before we start discussing that, the things you listed were not things that we considered.

1096
01:38:34,247 --> 01:38:38,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not something we debated and rejected.

1097
01:38:40,197 --> 01:38:42,518
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not there because we didn't consider it.

1098
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:43,498
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1099
01:38:44,078 --> 01:38:50,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Following that up... Can the Collins Center tell us if in mass general laws it's prohibited?

1100
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:55,941
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

1101
01:38:56,081 --> 01:38:59,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Convicted felons can run for municipal office.

1102
01:38:59,961 --> 01:39:01,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there's quite a few in the state house.

1103
01:39:04,102 --> 01:39:06,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Anthony or Frank, do you have any comments about this?

1104
01:39:08,036 --> 01:39:17,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess I'll just start with, you know, we don't give legal advice, but I'm not aware of any state law prohibiting that for local.

1105
01:39:18,447 --> 01:39:26,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Positions from the state level, I don't think it's something we've ever recommended and sort of, I guess, an unflattering response from us is.

1106
01:39:28,674 --> 01:39:34,478
[SPEAKER_03]: To look and determine how common it is, we'd have to do some research.

1107
01:39:34,619 --> 01:39:41,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some charters where there's a, particularly for ward Councilors, a time limit to live in the particular ward.

1108
01:39:42,485 --> 01:39:43,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've seen that.

1109
01:39:44,166 --> 01:39:48,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen too many regarding the felony conviction piece.

1110
01:39:48,698 --> 01:39:51,520
[SPEAKER_07]: The felony one in Everett appears to be new.

1111
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:56,424
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it was amended as part of an October 2021 update.

1112
01:39:57,845 --> 01:40:03,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Acts of 2021, chapter 14, amended as part of the October 2021 update.

1113
01:40:03,249 --> 01:40:05,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So that appears to be relatively new.

1114
01:40:05,651 --> 01:40:15,019
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in regards to length of residency, I came across this in Chickapee's

1115
01:40:17,381 --> 01:40:25,026
[SPEAKER_07]: charter, and it comes under Article 8 general provisions, certain persons not eligible.

1116
01:40:25,967 --> 01:40:40,018
[SPEAKER_07]: No person shall be eligible to any of the offices of the city government except superintendent of schools, city solicitor, and city engineer, unless he is a citizen and has been a resident of the city for at least two years.

1117
01:40:43,758 --> 01:40:59,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if there's something, and I suppose there would be some debate as to what that number of years would be, two or more, but there's precedent for it.

1118
01:41:00,509 --> 01:41:00,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1119
01:41:01,892 --> 01:41:03,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette.

1120
01:41:04,233 --> 01:41:15,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, when I looked at some things pertaining the school committee, it specified that a person should be a resident for a year.

1121
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:17,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1122
01:41:19,102 --> 01:41:19,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1123
01:41:19,582 --> 01:41:23,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen those questions come up.

1124
01:41:28,047 --> 01:41:30,168
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to include something like that,

1125
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:42,456
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be very specific because I've seen the issue come up and the question then becomes, well, a year from when?

1126
01:41:42,976 --> 01:41:45,238
[SPEAKER_04]: A year from when they pull papers?

1127
01:41:46,018 --> 01:41:49,820
[SPEAKER_04]: A year from the date of their preliminary?

1128
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,481
[SPEAKER_04]: A year from the date of the general election?

1129
01:41:52,581 --> 01:41:55,983
[SPEAKER_04]: A year from the date that they would take office?

1130
01:41:58,582 --> 01:42:14,285
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you're going to go down that road, you want to be sure to be very specific as to what your residency requirement is as relates to a calendar.

1131
01:42:15,726 --> 01:42:24,648
[SPEAKER_04]: The only observation I would make as to residency requirements beyond elected officials is

1132
01:42:28,085 --> 01:42:32,469
[SPEAKER_04]: My experiences is a sense that if you have a residency requirement.

1133
01:42:34,150 --> 01:42:40,756
[SPEAKER_04]: City offices, the department heads, et cetera, that you limit the pool from which.

1134
01:42:41,617 --> 01:42:42,778
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to hire.

1135
01:42:44,115 --> 01:42:49,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Professionals generally, by and large, or anybody who's going to be an employee of the city.

1136
01:42:50,117 --> 01:42:56,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as far as the quality of your candidates will be a much limited, more limited pool.

1137
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:00,661
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, if you're looking at a city engineer, or you're looking.

1138
01:43:01,501 --> 01:43:04,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, etc, etc, you know, it employees.

1139
01:43:08,123 --> 01:43:10,505
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's a policy decision you have to make.

1140
01:43:11,305 --> 01:43:18,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you want to limit yourself to the 50 or 1,000 residents of Medford?

1141
01:43:19,931 --> 01:43:29,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And of that group, how many have interest in working for the city versus a much broader pool of people in, say, the greater Boston area who might be interested?

1142
01:43:32,243 --> 01:43:32,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

1143
01:43:34,204 --> 01:43:35,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Paulette, were you going to speak?

1144
01:43:36,065 --> 01:43:49,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I just wanted to, I would have no interest for it to be a residency requirement for positions, but for elected officials, if let's suppose, you know, we now have this ward system.

1145
01:43:50,432 --> 01:43:55,977
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see that there's, I really want to be elected.

1146
01:43:56,077 --> 01:43:59,540
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to rent an apartment in another ward.

1147
01:44:00,701 --> 01:44:04,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I can run in that ward, because in my ward, there's no chance.

1148
01:44:05,065 --> 01:44:08,408
[SPEAKER_09]: So the question is, that's okay if someone wants to move.

1149
01:44:08,949 --> 01:44:13,633
[SPEAKER_09]: But shouldn't they live in that ward for at least a year before they run to represent that ward?

1150
01:44:15,098 --> 01:44:27,871
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember, if you think about it on the federal level, there were discussions about opportunist nature of some people say moving to New York in order to run for whatever and however you settle, but that's what the discussion is.

1151
01:44:28,371 --> 01:44:32,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So in my mind, it actually makes some sense to say, we want you to live in

1152
01:44:35,538 --> 01:44:37,359
[SPEAKER_09]: where you're going to be elected for a year.

1153
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:45,166
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would say from the time you pull papers would be a, because remember, when you, when you pull papers, you have to, you have to put in your address.

1154
01:44:46,867 --> 01:44:56,195
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what if I'm moving from Somerville and I've got a Somerville address, you know, or whatever, I mean, it says it has to be, so I don't know.

1155
01:44:56,235 --> 01:44:58,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just, I'm thinking, yes, it makes some sense to do.

1156
01:44:59,317 --> 01:45:00,918
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would not go more than a year.

1157
01:45:01,259 --> 01:45:02,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a year is a reasonable time.

1158
01:45:04,237 --> 01:45:05,618
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, David?

1159
01:45:05,638 --> 01:45:17,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, number one, I think in terms of opportunists, a year is hardly a hindrance, right?

1160
01:45:18,486 --> 01:45:28,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think at the end of the day, this is a place where we have to trust voters to elect the people they want to elect.

1161
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:32,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why we would put arbitrary requirements in front of the voters.

1162
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:56,462
[SPEAKER_02]: um you know if you can convince your neighbors that that you're the person to represent them you know as i i think you should have to live in the city you know we shouldn't have somebody from uh living in in los angeles on uh the metford uh uh city council but um so i don't know i think that these types of things are are

1163
01:45:57,543 --> 01:46:05,967
[SPEAKER_02]: both arbitrary and kind of like weirdly take power away from the voters in a way that leaves a bad taste in my mouth, personally.

1164
01:46:07,367 --> 01:46:08,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thanks.

1165
01:46:08,548 --> 01:46:14,270
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we have Gene and Ron, but we haven't heard from Maury much, and I see Maury's hand, so can we hear from Maury?

1166
01:46:16,971 --> 01:46:17,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thanks.

1167
01:46:18,932 --> 01:46:24,515
[SPEAKER_00]: My thinking on this is I definitely agree with our elected officials to have

1168
01:46:25,897 --> 01:46:29,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of length in the city before they're eligible.

1169
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:37,741
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always used kind of like different organizations become president or executive board members.

1170
01:46:37,801 --> 01:46:40,982
[SPEAKER_00]: We always use one calendar year.

1171
01:46:43,006 --> 01:46:53,153
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can stretch it out to a year and a half, year, you know, whenever, however long that person has lived in that area, it's based on one calendar year.

1172
01:46:53,293 --> 01:46:57,837
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I have to say, but I do, I do believe in the residency requirement.

1173
01:46:59,538 --> 01:47:00,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

1174
01:47:01,319 --> 01:47:02,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Ron and then Jean.

1175
01:47:04,301 --> 01:47:05,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Jean can go first.

1176
01:47:05,802 --> 01:47:06,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Jean.

1177
01:47:08,464 --> 01:47:10,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ron.

1178
01:47:10,906 --> 01:47:15,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in the chat, but there is in section nine of the model charter something.

1179
01:47:16,952 --> 01:47:18,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you just clarify the model charter?

1180
01:47:18,874 --> 01:47:22,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you mean the generic modern charter that the Common Center provided?

1181
01:47:22,217 --> 01:47:25,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, on felony convictions.

1182
01:47:28,304 --> 01:47:34,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I would caution that if that's a route that this group wants to go down, that we do it very carefully and thoughtfully.

1183
01:47:35,349 --> 01:47:41,514
[SPEAKER_01]: People who have served time can be good elected officials if they have rehabilitated.

1184
01:47:42,955 --> 01:47:55,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we know our criminal justice system disproportionately impacts people of color who are arrested more, served longer sentences, convicted more of exact same crimes.

1185
01:47:56,425 --> 01:47:58,467
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be cautious at the same time.

1186
01:47:58,507 --> 01:48:04,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm on the group that's looking at the citizens petition, and we know what happened in Fall River.

1187
01:48:04,072 --> 01:48:14,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are times when there's been corruption cases against elected officials, and then what do you do about that?

1188
01:48:14,442 --> 01:48:19,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just think it's really complicated and something that we should be thoughtful about.

1189
01:48:20,654 --> 01:48:25,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Jean, what section nine is what, what is the heading of that section?

1190
01:48:25,641 --> 01:48:26,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1191
01:48:26,602 --> 01:48:28,164
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a catch-all.

1192
01:48:28,305 --> 01:48:29,987
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a general provisions.

1193
01:48:30,407 --> 01:48:30,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1194
01:48:31,709 --> 01:48:32,831
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may.

1195
01:48:32,871 --> 01:48:33,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead, Anthony.

1196
01:48:34,273 --> 01:48:36,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to add.

1197
01:48:37,871 --> 01:48:43,796
[SPEAKER_03]: To the extent that, so I've never dealt with felony convictions in the qualifications for office piece.

1198
01:48:44,377 --> 01:48:50,002
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some communities that have a provision on felony convictions, and they sort of fall into two categories.

1199
01:48:50,602 --> 01:48:58,770
[SPEAKER_03]: One is you're holding office and you're convicted of a felony for really anything, anywhere, and that subjecting you to possibly a censure or removal.

1200
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:11,577
[SPEAKER_03]: or two, you're holding office and you're convicted of a felony or some activity related to your office, and that also removing you or subjecting you to censure or removal from office.

1201
01:49:12,117 --> 01:49:20,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Watertown, I think, is the most recent one where they've got the broader one where if you're convicted of a felony anywhere, you are subject to censure or removal.

1202
01:49:21,563 --> 01:49:24,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just never dealt with it in the context of the application.

1203
01:49:25,637 --> 01:49:33,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So does that include somebody having been convicted of a felony in their past that comes out later while they're serving?

1204
01:49:34,402 --> 01:49:41,946
[SPEAKER_03]: So the provisions that I've seen or been a part of, they are for convictions while you're serving in office for activity.

1205
01:49:42,606 --> 01:49:49,170
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the convictions while you're in office and the activity in theory is, you know, they don't cover all possible circumstances, but in theory it sounds like.

1206
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:53,193
[SPEAKER_05]: The model shows Pittsfield and it's exactly that.

1207
01:49:54,535 --> 01:50:04,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Only elected officials who have been convicted of a state or federal felony while holding office shall be deemed to have vacated their office.

1208
01:50:04,844 --> 01:50:07,286
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a distinction for sure.

1209
01:50:07,306 --> 01:50:10,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's vacate and not become ineligible.

1210
01:50:10,749 --> 01:50:11,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you said?

1211
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:12,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1212
01:50:14,014 --> 01:50:23,860
[SPEAKER_05]: vacate so they couldn't hear run again and be re-elected probably it just says they have to vacate their office the action has to take place while they're in office according to pittsfields

1213
01:50:26,029 --> 01:50:29,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have something else on this topic as well.

1214
01:50:31,372 --> 01:50:36,996
[SPEAKER_05]: We've kind of developed over this year and a half a theme of voters trusting the voters.

1215
01:50:37,517 --> 01:50:46,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talk about the ward representation decision, and there's a lot of concern about what if a ward does not have a representative, what happens?

1216
01:50:47,561 --> 01:50:50,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in ward representation, you must be part of that ward.

1217
01:50:50,462 --> 01:50:58,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there's provisions that we've talked about that when you leave the ward, there's a process to change to make sure you always have a ward representative.

1218
01:50:58,665 --> 01:51:04,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we're sticking to ward representation, I think that that makes it a lot more personal.

1219
01:51:05,648 --> 01:51:12,330
[SPEAKER_05]: The election process becomes a lot more personal, a lot more, you identify with the candidates a lot more.

1220
01:51:12,410 --> 01:51:15,331
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think all this other stuff goes away.

1221
01:51:15,592 --> 01:51:16,652
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my opinion.

1222
01:51:18,429 --> 01:51:19,749
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, thank you.

1223
01:51:19,929 --> 01:51:20,250
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1224
01:51:20,370 --> 01:51:23,270
[SPEAKER_13]: We have we have like maybe one or one more minute on this.

1225
01:51:23,390 --> 01:51:25,771
[SPEAKER_13]: But Anthony and Phyllis want to speak.

1226
01:51:25,811 --> 01:51:34,633
[SPEAKER_08]: So just quickly, I'm a little worried about the ward stuff with the residency of living in that particular ward.

1227
01:51:34,673 --> 01:51:36,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Give a message being such a small community.

1228
01:51:37,374 --> 01:51:39,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, you can be live on the street.

1229
01:51:40,715 --> 01:51:45,416
[SPEAKER_08]: and your neighbor is in a different ward on the next block, you know.

1230
01:51:45,496 --> 01:51:49,257
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's something we need to look at further.

1231
01:51:49,877 --> 01:52:05,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And just on the felony stuff, in Massachusetts, you know, we have, you know, quarry where criminal offender record information where, you know, after 10 years, most people who have a felony don't even have to kind of,

1232
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:15,147
[SPEAKER_08]: acknowledge that felony on job applications, that box has been removed in the state, you know, if you've been convicted of felony.

1233
01:52:15,407 --> 01:52:18,570
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't even ask that of employees now.

1234
01:52:19,311 --> 01:52:26,056
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if they have a, you know, if they can pass a quarry, they, you know, they don't even have to answer that question.

1235
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:30,399
[SPEAKER_08]: So just that being said, I think we,

1236
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:35,862
[SPEAKER_08]: We shouldn't be looking at putting barriers up for people to run.

1237
01:52:35,902 --> 01:52:38,484
[SPEAKER_08]: We should be looking to kind of take them down.

1238
01:52:39,044 --> 01:52:48,328
[SPEAKER_08]: We started out wanting to make it, flatten the field and to try to be more inclusive.

1239
01:52:48,488 --> 01:52:55,592
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think we should set up a lot of kind of limitations and restrictions on who can run.

1240
01:52:56,933 --> 01:53:01,195
[SPEAKER_08]: When they can win, you know, if they get the votes, they should be elected.

1241
01:53:02,716 --> 01:53:03,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1242
01:53:03,457 --> 01:53:03,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Phyllis.

1243
01:53:05,038 --> 01:53:06,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a couple of quick things.

1244
01:53:07,479 --> 01:53:13,463
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate Eunice's bringing this information forth because we could always say that we have now had a discussion on it.

1245
01:53:14,143 --> 01:53:15,784
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's very important.

1246
01:53:16,385 --> 01:53:20,107
[SPEAKER_10]: But the most important reason I raised my hand, it is now 8-24.

1247
01:53:22,055 --> 01:53:22,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1248
01:53:22,856 --> 01:53:27,258
[SPEAKER_10]: And as much as I really, I think this meeting has been very informative.

1249
01:53:27,959 --> 01:53:32,222
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to get ready to watch the State of the Union Address by the President of the United States.

1250
01:53:33,583 --> 01:53:43,149
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I don't know, Milva, where you want to take us or where we want to end on this or that, but the time is coming short now.

1251
01:53:43,865 --> 01:53:44,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that is right.

1252
01:53:45,826 --> 01:53:56,091
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think what I want to do is I feel like we have some questions about eligibility and we're going to, I think we're going to have more discussion on that at our next meeting.

1253
01:53:56,811 --> 01:53:58,452
[SPEAKER_13]: So think it over and.

1254
01:54:01,307 --> 01:54:05,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I will put the eligibility sections in blue in Articles 2 and 3.

1255
01:54:05,652 --> 01:54:06,953
[SPEAKER_13]: We will discuss that more.

1256
01:54:06,973 --> 01:54:18,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Please carefully read Articles 2 and 3, and we will try to resolve all the issues, and we will provisionally vote on it at the next meeting.

1257
01:54:18,465 --> 01:54:19,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that sound like a plan?

1258
01:54:19,566 --> 01:54:22,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for giving it more time.

1259
01:54:22,269 --> 01:54:23,010
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.

1260
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:32,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so we only have a few minutes, and we were going to just quickly have subcommittee reports.

1261
01:54:32,736 --> 01:54:38,200
[SPEAKER_13]: I can say I did, next meeting we'll also look at Article 7, which I shared with you.

1262
01:54:38,361 --> 01:54:44,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Article 7 has a draft, so hopefully we can get that taken care of.

1263
01:54:46,006 --> 01:54:47,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other subcommittees want to chime in?

1264
01:54:49,773 --> 01:54:51,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Paula.

1265
01:54:51,334 --> 01:54:54,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to announce that we're going to set up two meetings.

1266
01:54:54,637 --> 01:55:00,902
[SPEAKER_09]: The first is Tuesday, March 19th, and the second one is Wednesday, April 10th.

1267
01:55:02,123 --> 01:55:07,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a Wednesday.

1268
01:55:09,268 --> 01:55:15,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think that we're trying to present at the meeting, what was it, April 18th meeting?

1269
01:55:16,374 --> 01:55:16,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1270
01:55:16,734 --> 01:55:17,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that sounds right.

1271
01:55:18,215 --> 01:55:20,196
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, so that's kind of our goal.

1272
01:55:22,117 --> 01:55:26,280
[SPEAKER_09]: By the 19th, we should understand whether that's really accurate, but hopefully it will be.

1273
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:28,241
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is for the school committee?

1274
01:55:28,641 --> 01:55:28,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1275
01:55:29,142 --> 01:55:30,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that's great.

1276
01:55:31,543 --> 01:55:38,968
[SPEAKER_13]: And Article 8, we're also working, and we have a lot of questions and a lot of research to do, but we're working.

1277
01:55:39,928 --> 01:55:42,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Anthony, Andrea, did you have your hand up?

1278
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:44,531
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just couldn't think of it.

1279
01:55:44,551 --> 01:55:44,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1280
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:53,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just want to say, I, I'm going to break my promise and not make that motion.

1281
01:55:54,756 --> 01:55:58,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we can get through questions at our next meeting.

1282
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:07,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I emailed them out beforehand, or is that a. A, no, no, you can email them.

1283
01:56:07,947 --> 01:56:08,828
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't talk about them.

1284
01:56:09,307 --> 01:56:19,975
[SPEAKER_13]: I think if you email them, we can just sort of prepare that to think about them, and then we would be prepared for the next meeting, but we just can't have discussion about them.

1285
01:56:21,115 --> 01:56:23,537
[SPEAKER_13]: But I am not an expert, and I'm not a lawyer, so.

1286
01:56:23,557 --> 01:56:26,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you just put them in the minutes?

1287
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:28,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry?

1288
01:56:28,921 --> 01:56:29,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in the agenda.

1289
01:56:30,562 --> 01:56:34,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, put them in the minutes, so everybody knows, or in the agenda.

1290
01:56:35,477 --> 01:56:35,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1291
01:56:36,178 --> 01:56:40,061
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you send them to me, Eunice, I'll put them in the agenda.

1292
01:56:40,241 --> 01:56:40,702
[SPEAKER_13]: How's that?

1293
01:56:41,322 --> 01:56:46,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see what I... I'll try and boil it down as best as I can.

1294
01:56:46,106 --> 01:56:49,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I went through it with a fine-tooth comb, and I apologize.

1295
01:56:49,049 --> 01:56:50,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1296
01:56:51,051 --> 01:56:53,393
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so... No, no.

1297
01:56:53,613 --> 01:56:55,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only no to apologize, like, that's awesome.

1298
01:56:55,895 --> 01:56:58,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody decides to sit down and do that.

1299
01:57:00,425 --> 01:57:00,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1300
01:57:02,027 --> 01:57:10,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Before we end, two minutes, I just want to ask if there's any members of the public that have any comments or questions or things that they want to share.

1301
01:57:14,278 --> 01:57:14,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1302
01:57:15,239 --> 01:57:18,642
[SPEAKER_13]: So, jeez, we're going to end two minutes early.

1303
01:57:19,143 --> 01:57:19,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my God.

1304
01:57:20,104 --> 01:57:21,265
[SPEAKER_13]: We can keep talking.

1305
01:57:23,367 --> 01:57:23,687
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1306
01:57:23,867 --> 01:57:24,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, everyone.

1307
01:57:25,677 --> 01:57:26,777
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll move to adjourn.

1308
01:57:26,797 --> 01:57:28,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait a minute.

1309
01:57:28,418 --> 01:57:29,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Aubrey, did you have a question?

1310
01:57:29,798 --> 01:57:29,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1311
01:57:29,978 --> 01:57:33,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you say the school committee dates one more time, Paulette?

1312
01:57:33,579 --> 01:57:41,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Tuesday, March 19th, which is not far off, and April 10th, Wednesday, April 10th.

1313
01:57:42,382 --> 01:57:42,902
[SPEAKER_07]: 7 o'clock, right?

1314
01:57:45,723 --> 01:57:47,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1315
01:57:47,403 --> 01:57:49,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Our next full committee meeting is April 4th.

1316
01:57:50,942 --> 01:57:52,505
[SPEAKER_13]: And we must have an article eight.

1317
01:57:53,167 --> 01:57:55,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next regular meeting is April 4th.

1318
01:57:56,970 --> 01:58:00,812
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will contact the Article 6 people and we'll schedule a meeting.

1319
01:58:01,333 --> 01:58:01,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

1320
01:58:02,073 --> 01:58:04,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have Article 8 meeting?

1321
01:58:04,194 --> 01:58:04,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1322
01:58:04,934 --> 01:58:05,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Did we set a date?

1323
01:58:05,975 --> 01:58:06,415
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't.

1324
01:58:06,435 --> 01:58:07,335
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we did.

1325
01:58:07,355 --> 01:58:09,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, geez.

1326
01:58:10,237 --> 01:58:11,557
[SPEAKER_13]: That fell off my radar then.

1327
01:58:11,778 --> 01:58:12,438
[SPEAKER_13]: I will do that.

1328
01:58:12,498 --> 01:58:16,600
[SPEAKER_07]: You weren't going to set a date until we got questions answered that we needed.

1329
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:17,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1330
01:58:18,641 --> 01:58:19,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what that's?

1331
01:58:19,541 --> 01:58:20,042
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1332
01:58:20,102 --> 01:58:20,542
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

1333
01:58:22,043 --> 01:58:34,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I put together a calendar and invited everybody to it on Google, and I was starting to put all of these meeting dates and other important city stuff in it, and I got feedback that nobody could see it.

1334
01:58:35,454 --> 01:58:39,037
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody wants to help me- I actually can't see it.

1335
01:58:40,098 --> 01:58:40,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1336
01:58:41,079 --> 01:58:42,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey is going to help you.

1337
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:51,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, I'll get in touch because I think this will be helpful for everybody so that we can, you know, for scheduling and so forth.

1338
01:58:51,345 --> 01:58:51,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1339
01:58:52,465 --> 01:58:58,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and Anthony Wilson, I think I sent you some questions about article eight and that must have been what I was waiting for.

1340
01:58:58,829 --> 01:59:01,270
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll send I'll resend them to you.

1341
01:59:03,412 --> 01:59:05,693
[SPEAKER_13]: They have to do with recalls and things like that.

1342
01:59:08,186 --> 01:59:11,112
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not working for anybody else but Aubrey and me.

1343
01:59:11,953 --> 01:59:12,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Gene can't see it.

1344
01:59:13,296 --> 01:59:19,026
[SPEAKER_07]: David, I think I'll work with Aubrey and see if we can make it because I think it would help people.

1345
01:59:19,467 --> 01:59:21,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, where's that motion to adjourn?

1346
01:59:22,433 --> 01:59:24,477
[SPEAKER_13]: I move that the meeting come to an end.

1347
01:59:25,118 --> 01:59:25,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1348
01:59:25,699 --> 01:59:26,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1349
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:26,741
[SPEAKER_13]: All in favor?

1350
01:59:26,761 --> 01:59:27,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1351
01:59:27,903 --> 01:59:28,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1352
01:59:28,684 --> 01:59:29,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll see you all soon.

1353
01:59:29,987 --> 01:59:30,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
