00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:14,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Alba, could we get a roll call of the commissioners?

6
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:16,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGibbon?

7
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:18,705

00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:24,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.

12
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief Buckley?

13
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Present, with four commissioners present.

14
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,490
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a quorum.

00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:44,360

00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Coordinator for the City of Medford, Jim Silver, and Director of Parking, Sarah McDermott.

20
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:49,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd Blake?

21
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I said Todd, didn't I?

22
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:51,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

23
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:52,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sorry.

24
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:53,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Alva's looking out for you, Todd.

25
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:07,656
[SPEAKER_06]: The minutes of the January traffic commission meetings have been forwarded to all commissioners.

26
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:18,244
[SPEAKER_06]: If the commissioners have seen them and have read them and have anything they want to discuss, otherwise we'll take a vote to approve the minutes.

27
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:26,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to approve.

28
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:33,610
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Commissioner McGiven to approve the January 2025 Traffic Commission meetings.

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

30
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:39,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded.

31
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:41,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

32
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Alma, roll call, please.

33
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:44,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGiven.

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:45,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

35
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:46,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

36
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:47,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

37
00:01:47,782 --> 00:01:48,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

38
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:49,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

39
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:50,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief Buckley?

40
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:51,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

41
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:57,869
[SPEAKER_06]: On the vote of four to nothing, the minutes of the January 25th Traffic Commission meeting have been accepted into the records.

42
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,611
[SPEAKER_06]: New business 2025-11.

43
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:04,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Sean Hill of 14 Winthrop Street.

44
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:07,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Request for visitor passes for Tesla Avenue.

45
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:11,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Parking is restricted on this portion of Winthrop Street for the Commissioner's

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,243
[SPEAKER_06]: as remember is Mr. Hill present and could we ask you to unmute yourself?

47
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:22,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not so sure we have many other people here present to participate.

48
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:37,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief, I don't see anybody by that name or raising their hand or indicating that they are a petitioner.

49
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:44,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither do I. And for Albert, he was notified and indicated that he would attend.

50
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:45,696
[SPEAKER_10]: He has been notified.

51
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:49,181
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been in conversation with him via telephone.

52
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:53,166
[SPEAKER_10]: He has had these business passes in previous years.

53
00:02:54,522 --> 00:03:00,190
[SPEAKER_10]: but he wasn't given them for renewal in 2025, that's why he has petitioned for them.

54
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,796
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's no parking on Winthrop Street, so he's between a rock and a hard place.

55
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:09,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and do you know if in the past he has petitioned this traffic commission for those passes?

56
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:12,193
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's not normal.

57
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the record, I'll speak to the public and to the commissioners.

58
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:18,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Winthrop Street, there's no parking on Winthrop Street.

59
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:27,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And when your legal residential address is not on a permanent parking street, but your property sits on the corner of a permanent parking street, which is this case,

60
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:34,547
[SPEAKER_06]: then the owner is entitled to automatically receive a permit for the resident permit parking street.

61
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:37,489
[SPEAKER_06]: However, they are not allowed to have visitor passes.

62
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Some members of the public do petition the traffic commission for visitor passes.

63
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:48,013
[SPEAKER_06]: And do we know, Albert, if he has petitioned this commission in the past?

64
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:51,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he has indicated to us that he's received them in the past.

65
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:54,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure on that.

66
00:03:54,646 --> 00:04:11,290
[SPEAKER_10]: In some instances where there is no parking on the main street Wentworth, they've given corner homes visitor passes, but maybe with the G zone, it might have a reflection on that and he had to petition.

67
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:14,191
[SPEAKER_10]: So he did come forward and petition for this year.

68
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:15,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

69
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:24,759
[SPEAKER_06]: If the commissioners have followed that, I will take some guidance if you have questions or suggestions on this petition without the petitioner present.

70
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:44,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I was searching our database and I'm not finding this in particular.

71
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:48,270
[SPEAKER_02]: May I speak, Chief Bursak?

72
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at the variance list and his name is there, but it does not say visitor passes.

73
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is on Tesla.

74
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:59,741
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on Winthrop Street, but it says parking on Tesla.

75
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:05,427
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't have anything in the notes that states specifically visitor passes.

76
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim, is there a historical record there that would indicate maybe last year or the year before?

77
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:19,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a carry through, it's a carry over from the list that was given originally two years ago when we implemented this process.

78
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:25,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think Alvin might have asked me that question and I did say his name was listed there.

79
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the notes are not there.

80
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:39,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back and looked through the history as much as I possibly could through the minutes from the parking meetings over the years, and I could not find that specific ruling.

81
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,715
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't give me the date when it was approved.

82
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:44,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

83
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:44,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, John.

84
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:52,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim, I felt the need to be able to replicate what you do, given your conversation earlier today.

85
00:05:52,398 --> 00:06:02,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to the file, the TC regulations complete, and would I be looking on the one that's labeled schedule F parking variances?

86
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:03,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

87
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:04,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to look at that.

88
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't see it.

89
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:10,595
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at F, if you go to the top of the page, you'll see the street listing.

90
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:17,087
[SPEAKER_02]: on the left side of this, so it's the street that they are parking on, not the street of their residence.

91
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,928
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's Tesla, it would be Tesla.

92
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,810
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two entries for Tesla.

93
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did see that.

94
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm trying to find that.

95
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:30,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to do a search on the page, but I can scroll down to Tesla.

96
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:31,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

97
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw the two

98
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:47,389
[SPEAKER_02]: This one references the parallel street that says those folks can park on Tesla, and then it has 22 Winthrop, I believe, is the address.

99
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Alvin, is that correct?

100
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:48,490
14.

101
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:54,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm having trouble loading it.

102
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:55,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's part of my trouble.

103
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:58,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go off the Wi-Fi first.

104
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:07,298
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just measured from 14 winter.

105
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:16,204
[SPEAKER_16]: If all those streets are resident permit, the visitors could park on Boston Ave, which is about 880 feet away, which is about a three and a half minute walk.

106
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:18,446
[SPEAKER_16]: If that helps the discussion.

107
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:26,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really understand why we give permits, but not visitor permits like.

108
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:34,677
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, I do like people to come and tell us what their situation is.

109
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that to be extremely helpful.

110
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:51,239
[SPEAKER_02]: During the search, we also noted that there was resident parking on Winthrop Street, and there is a legacy sign by the former Sacred Heart Church location.

111
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not inconceivable that at one point, resident parking was there.

112
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,501
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that we are petitioning to take that sign down.

113
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:04,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, there's no parking on that segment of Winthrop Street anymore, but a sign does exist.

114
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,644
[SPEAKER_06]: guess is that's extremely awful when the church was there.

115
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:34,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Well we could deny the petition based on the Traffic Commission rule related to resident permit parking variances for corner residential homes and in light of the petitioner not being present, the

116
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:50,854
[SPEAKER_06]: petitioner could always request it again in the future, moving forward, but I will leave that to the commissioners to make a decision on what to write.

117
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:52,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask a quick question?

118
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.

119
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:59,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is this something we would consider granting if they could complete their case?

120
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:01,843
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, can we table it?

121
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:03,783
[SPEAKER_03]: a month?

122
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:07,866
[SPEAKER_06]: We can table anything and we have considered this in the past.

123
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:11,028
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't tell you what level we allow.

124
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:17,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe, like Commissioner Hunt has indicated, we'd like to hear their story and their cases to what we granted.

125
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:19,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is possible in tabling.

126
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:22,575
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a resolution to this.

127
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:31,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'd support getting rid of it, but as a courtesy, I'd support tabling it just to give them another month to come talk.

128
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:34,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we have a motion to table.

129
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:35,694
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Commissioner Brzezinski.

130
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:36,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

131
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:45,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll second that.

132
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:48,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

133
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:51,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Alba, roll call, please.

134
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:53,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGiven.

135
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:54,471
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

136
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

137
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:58,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

138
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:00,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

139
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:01,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

140
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:02,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief Buckley?

141
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:03,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

142
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,262
[SPEAKER_06]: On the vote of three to one to zero, the motion is approved.

143
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:08,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Table 2025-11.

144
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:10,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll vote.

145
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:16,049
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll reach out to that petitioner and see what's going on.

146
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:16,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

147
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:18,991
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-12, perfect parking variance for Harvard Street.

148
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:21,333
[SPEAKER_06]: From Christopher Miller, 379 Main Street.

149
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:35,372
[SPEAKER_06]: The petitioner has indicated he has had a variance for permits in 2023 and 2024, but has been denied for 2025 citing changes to the policy with the adoption of the GLXR.

150
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:39,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the petitioner, Mr. Miller, present, and could we ask them to unmute?

151
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:46,635
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is somebody raising his hand, a viola, why don't I, I'll ask him to unmute.

152
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:47,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

153
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:53,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Beautiful, thank you very much.

154
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,513
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Tony Viola and good evening everybody.

155
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:05,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got a call from a landlord at 379 Main Street in Medford where Mr. Miller lives.

156
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,661
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a second floor tenant.

157
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:10,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got a call from him a few minutes ago, suggesting that he couldn't

158
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:14,507
[SPEAKER_11]: make the meeting this evening, and he asked if I would stand in for him.

159
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:23,033
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure what the protocol would be with respect to the traffic commission, and if you'd like to table this for another month, that would be perfectly fine.

160
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:28,556
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems reasonably straightforward in light of especially what the chief has just said.

161
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:34,060
[SPEAKER_11]: But if it's something that needs to be tabled, please, I would love you to consider that as well.

162
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,063
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'd be happy to sit in and explain some of the situation to you.

163
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:42,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for being present, Mr. Viola, we understand.

164
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally, the petition should be presented by the petitioner.

165
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:53,758
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we have historic rules from the Traffic Commission related to residential homes and apartments on corners.

166
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,903
[SPEAKER_06]: We have recently made Harvard Street a resident-private parking street based on the GLX zone.

167
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:08,130
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been some offline discussion I've had with Jim Silver, et cetera, but the point is,

168
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:15,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on the rule, this petitioner would be allowed a variance to park on Harvard Street.

169
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:22,439
[SPEAKER_06]: and it would be automatic and it could be granted just for the parking department.

170
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,380
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not need traffic commission approval.

171
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:34,545
[SPEAKER_06]: The difference this year would be that this individual with that variance would be given a GLX zone parking permit, which will allow them to park anywhere within the zone.

172
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:43,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I just wanted the commissioners to understand that that the new zone, there's an impact on the rule as it relates to the new GLX zone.

173
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:48,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Thoughts on this or would you like to wait for the petitioner?

174
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:56,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'd be interested to hear sort of what the issue is, if Mr. Viola can explain it to us.

175
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:12,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I recognize that Main Street is not a street that residents can park on, and this person has clearly been used to parking on Harvard Street, and they must be in the section that hasn't allowed parking recently, so he's been having to park up the street.

176
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:19,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, isn't this right near the corner is where we actually said it's not wide enough to park.

177
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been enforcing the no parking there.

178
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:29,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, this section measures the part that's no parking, which is next to that building, like I said.

179
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:35,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see that?

180
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:38,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that since Mr. Viola made the effort to come, we can at least hear what he has to say.

181
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:43,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can figure out if we can decide or if we need to table it or deny it or approve it or whatever.

182
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fair enough.

183
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:52,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other commissioners have a thoughts on Mr. Viola presenting on behalf of the petitioner and or the rule itself?

184
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:54,024
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm okay with it.

185
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:55,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree.

186
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:59,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I will turn it back to the petitioner's representative.

187
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:07,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Viola, can you just speak briefly on the reason that your tenant is, should you know, or is a need in

188
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:12,100
[SPEAKER_06]: perhaps discuss the issue of parking around the apartment building?

189
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:26,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Just very quickly, Chief, for the record, Mr. Miller discovered recently that he had a parking permit that was issued for Harvard Street back on August 25th of 2023.

190
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:33,494
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the permit number if you need me to tell it to you.

191
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:40,776
[SPEAKER_11]: He was on the impression that the permit was valid for one year from 8-25-23 to 8-25-24.

192
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:47,957
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when he went into the parking clerk's office was denied the ability to renew the permit.

193
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:51,458
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it probably expired back in 12-31-23 to start with.

194
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:08,700
[SPEAKER_11]: So now he's been parking on Main Street, and the walk is a little bit longer, obviously, to get to Main Street areas where he can park that isn't restricted by time, especially during daytime.

195
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:21,888
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been a tenant again since 2023 and had the benefit of a parking pass to park on Harvard Street, and he would like to have that renewed if possible.

196
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:34,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I under the impression that the parking variance should be automatic or is it by vote of the Traffic Commission when you have a corner lot?

197
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:43,354
[SPEAKER_11]: that is a corner lot in a GLX zone or in a corner lot on a resident permit parking street?

198
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:54,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, so by rule, the rule of the traffic commission, given that this is a corner residential property where the

199
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:04,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And in this case, Main Street is not a resident permit parking, but we have just made Harvard Street a permit parking over the past several, for this past summer.

200
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:12,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So it allows your tenant to automatically receive a permit, resident permit parking for Harvard.

201
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:16,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So by rule, you are correct in understanding that.

202
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:21,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Historically, Harvard was not a permit parking street until we made the GLX also.

203
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:28,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So does that render this the meeting that we're having now about the variance move or is it something that we would want to do?

204
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:31,067
[SPEAKER_06]: That is my next question of the commissioners.

205
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:40,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Should they agree that this is a moot point for the traffic commission and or parking director McDermott is present also if they have a thought or concern.

206
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:41,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

207
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:41,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

208
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,409
[SPEAKER_08]: May I speak to this, please?

209
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:48,771
[SPEAKER_08]: So the variance that this resident is seeking.

210
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:51,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Would kind of set the.

211
00:16:52,414 --> 00:17:00,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of set a precedent for the rest of the G L X zone and any future zones that might be created.

212
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So the I believe the reason the

213
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:14,647
[SPEAKER_08]: If they get Harvard Street as a variance, that's lumped into the G zone, which means they could park anywhere with that variance.

214
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:27,215
[SPEAKER_08]: They could park on Wareham, Marion, all those streets in that zone, Yale Street, and that hasn't been approved, which is why it was originally denied by the clerks.

215
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:33,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that's why the resident or the landlord was sent to the traffic commission to seek this variance.

216
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:43,551
[SPEAKER_08]: in granting this variance, it might set the stage for any other corner variances that would lead to a variance in the G zone.

217
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:48,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

218
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:55,293
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a valid description of the impact of the commission.

219
00:17:55,313 --> 00:18:03,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So the commissioners, do we have any concerns with upholding our, well, do we have any concerns with upholding the rule as it stands?

220
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:05,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

221
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:14,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that the corner variance rule had been contemplated with the idea of zoned parking.

222
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:25,636
[SPEAKER_01]: It would give him permission rather than just on the street throughout the whole zone, which is like a huge level of parking other than that had not been contemplated.

223
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:26,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

224
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:27,818
[SPEAKER_14]: More space.

225
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:39,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, it is possible to walk down the street down to Main Street, like three blocks, I think, two blocks in either direction, two to three, and get parking.

226
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:42,909
[SPEAKER_01]: On Harvard, he's actually going to have to walk up.

227
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:49,953
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not literally a block, but it's the same distance up Harvard Street to where parking is allowed.

228
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:58,109
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like he could just park next to his house on the side street.

229
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,690
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all factors.

230
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:16,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess if this was a street where Main Street had no options, I might feel like we've just taken away all his parking by creating the zone.

231
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:21,993
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we haven't, but it could be somewhere else in the zone.

232
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,722
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Commissioner, I think it almost is irrelevant what street we give it on.

233
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:33,163
[SPEAKER_06]: He's had Hobbit in the past.

234
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:35,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's a concern over granting Hobbit.

235
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:49,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if we granted Wareham, which we've done in the past, if we've granted Marion, which we've done in the past, the question still remained, that would entitle the owner of that variance to park anywhere within the GLX zone.

236
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I think by rule, I'm fine with that.

237
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:56,133
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is that the rest of the commission is fine with that.

238
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,862
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm okay with that, because we're just carrying through status quo.

239
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:05,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you're a corner lot, you kind of have frontage on a G zone street anyway.

240
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:09,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Buzzynski?

241
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:11,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.

242
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:19,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'd like to implement the plan that we have versus, you know, granting a variance.

243
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:23,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt, any?

244
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay with it if the others are.

245
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:37,076
[SPEAKER_06]: If the commissioners will allow, can I ask Jim Silva to weigh in on this, because he was the planner behind the GLX on.

246
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim, comments and your thoughts on this?

247
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:40,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.

248
00:20:40,977 --> 00:20:46,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this probably is the best case scenario to grant to any of those streets.

249
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:47,259
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is,

250
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:55,485
[SPEAKER_02]: If we keep granting to Harvard Street when it wasn't a zone, we don't even know how many parking spaces exist.

251
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:58,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're granting all of this opportunity to park in one location.

252
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:03,191
[SPEAKER_02]: But the zone parking perspective, now you're spreading it out dramatically.

253
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:07,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people need a place to park, they're no longer relegated to one location.

254
00:21:07,954 --> 00:21:12,418
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually able to park anywhere in the area, in the proximity to their home.

255
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:13,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So to your point,

256
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:23,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we were waiting for the G zone to become a reality from its temporary situation to a reality of a permanency.

257
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:28,928
[SPEAKER_02]: But that said, this is sort of a precedent for those corner homes going forward.

258
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:32,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not overwhelming one street, we're actually spreading it out.

259
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:35,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

260
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:42,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And Director McDermott, any issues from the parking director perspective of maintaining the same rule?

261
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:54,666
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Jim Silva and I have discussed this briefly and I'm on board with granting this and similar variances in zoned parking in the future.

262
00:21:54,686 --> 00:22:00,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think I think it makes sense that we were, we didn't have a solution for this because we weren't sure of the permanency of the G zone.

263
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:03,794
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I believe that's on the agenda tonight.

264
00:22:03,894 --> 00:22:04,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I guess, maybe we'll.

265
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:10,121
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll see what happens but for now I have no objections to granting this variance.

266
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:14,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay and no concerns if Mr. Miller shows up in the next couple of days to get his variance?

267
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:15,570
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

268
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

269
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Viola, having heard from the commissioners,

270
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:35,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I can state that this is not a matter for this traffic commission this evening and the rule of the traffic commission that would allow your tenant to receive a resident permit parking is still in existence.

271
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:47,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I would, if you have any questions, I would accept on behalf of the petitioner, a withdrawal of the petition with the understanding that he's eligible to get this without traffic commission approval.

272
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:50,004
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure he'd be very happy with that, no question.

273
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:52,266
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, no further questions.

274
00:22:53,146 --> 00:22:54,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a nice resolve.

275
00:22:55,208 --> 00:23:14,084
[SPEAKER_11]: And just from a landlord's perspective, it's so much easier to be able to tell a tenant, a prospective tenant that a permit is available to you rather than needing prior to site execution of a lease to come and appear before the traffic commission to obtain a variance for the parking.

276
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:25,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially when I back and did some research and I think I found 10 variances that were approved for corner lots over the past year and a half or so.

277
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:26,273
[SPEAKER_11]: But when the 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

278
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:37,480
[SPEAKER_11]: that was coming in for a corner lot was approved kind of in a, you know, after some discussion.

279
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,183
[SPEAKER_11]: But it will save you guys, I think, a lot more time and effort and energy that could be directed in other areas.

280
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:45,104
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, thank you so much.

281
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:46,825
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be wonderful if we could get this voted.

282
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:55,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I do appreciate your time and your presentation, first of all, and thank you on behalf of your petitioner.

283
00:23:55,883 --> 00:24:05,386
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-13, permit parking variance for Honeywell Ave from Rafael Zarzenak Gomes, 305 Riverside Ave, Apartment 4.

284
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:08,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Mr. Gomes present and could you unmute?

285
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:14,668
[SPEAKER_16]: He is here.

286
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,869
[SPEAKER_16]: He mentioned in the chat that he doesn't speak

287
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:18,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that Rafael?

288
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:19,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

289
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:21,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm asking him to unmute now.

290
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:44,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

291
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:46,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Mr. Gomes?

292
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:47,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

293
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:49,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, welcome to the Traffic Commission.

294
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,630
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a petition before us.

295
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:55,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're trying to find the chat message.

296
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:02,155
[SPEAKER_06]: You indicated through the chat that you do not speak English very well.

297
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:05,276
[SPEAKER_06]: What language do you speak primarily?

298
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:12,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he muted himself.

299
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,040
[SPEAKER_01]: There, I sent it again.

300
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

301
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:32,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Mr. Gomes, how are you?

302
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good.

303
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:34,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

304
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:40,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry, I tried to speak, but I think he was moved.

305
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:44,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I was leaving Summerville, I moved to Medford right now.

306
00:25:45,498 --> 00:25:45,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

307
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:46,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop.

308
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:56,023
[SPEAKER_07]: But I need to park my car, I'd like to park my car in this street, because I'm parked so far.

309
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:57,583
[SPEAKER_07]: It's possible.

310
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a permit to park there.

311
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:03,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so you live at 305 Riverside Ave.

312
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:05,486
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an apartment building off of that.

313
00:26:05,806 --> 00:26:08,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they provide you with a parking spot?

314
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:21,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he keeps pushing the mute button.

315
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:25,053
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope nobody else is hitting his mute button.

316
00:26:27,782 --> 00:26:28,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent him another email.

317
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:31,624
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

318
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,165
[SPEAKER_07]: In apartment, there is just one spot.

319
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:37,266
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

320
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:41,468
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have one spot provided to you by the owner of the property.

321
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:44,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you have two vehicles?

322
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't buy.

323
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Another person is using this spot.

324
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a spot to put my car.

325
00:26:55,957 --> 00:26:57,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Another person you reside with?

326
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:01,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry?

327
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:05,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it someone you live with or somebody they did not provide?

328
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

329
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

330
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,600
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

331
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,941
[SPEAKER_07]: The apartment, there are two rooms.

332
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:13,742
[SPEAKER_07]: The people are using this spot.

333
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:17,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a spot in the building, you know?

334
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to park it so far.

335
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:22,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to walk about five minutes every day.

336
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,244
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so hard for me.

337
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:25,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ask where you are?

338
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:28,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, can I ask where you are parking?

339
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:34,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm parking, let me check in the maps, one second.

340
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:45,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Some days I park in Spring Street, some days I park in Bradshaw Street.

341
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:50,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, hang on tight for one second.

342
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:53,112
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me, I saw plates,

343
00:27:54,636 --> 00:28:05,217
[SPEAKER_07]: i came parking i i don't know how can i say this is a honey hill avenue right yes yes is it possible i park there

344
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we'll debate that right now.

345
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,261
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can hang tight, we may have some further questions.

346
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:29,284
[SPEAKER_06]: So commissioners, the petitioner is requesting, because there's multiple people in his apartment, a variance for his vehicle to park on Honeywell Ave because there's no place for him to park on 305 Riverside Ave.

347
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:32,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have questions of the petitioner or concerns?

348
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,411
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a question.

349
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:45,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner McGiven.

350
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, go ahead.

351
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:54,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you realize, I guess, when you rented this place that there was only one space and that it wasn't available to you?

352
00:28:54,498 --> 00:29:03,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I can ask again.

353
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:05,045
[SPEAKER_01]: He keeps muting himself.

354
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Please leave yourself unmuted if you can.

355
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:10,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know what is happening.

356
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:11,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, can you repeat, please?

357
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:13,077
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

358
00:29:13,238 --> 00:29:19,622
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to know if you knew when you were renting this apartment that it did not have a parking space for you.

359
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:28,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I knew about it before, but she told me I can't park in 100 Hill Avenue.

360
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:30,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked her.

361
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:38,736
[SPEAKER_07]: She told me I can't park in this street, but I'm living one month and I'm parking on the street.

362
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:39,977
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, it's so bad.

363
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:41,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what I can do.

364
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:54,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

365
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief, may I speak on

366
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:14,683
[SPEAKER_02]: for the parking permitting process.

367
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:22,168
[SPEAKER_02]: They, I believe, arrived from Somerville and assumed that our parking program was similar to Somerville's.

368
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:25,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that was sort of the misconception.

369
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:37,219
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have an opportunity to speak on the way that we work, the parameters here, and coming to the Traffic Commission, hence he's here this evening.

370
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:43,560
[SPEAKER_02]: and sort of the variance rules and what is needed to actually, if it is approved to get that permitting.

371
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:51,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I think during that initial rental period, it was sort of understood that resident parking was available.

372
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:56,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that explanation, Joe.

373
00:30:58,543 --> 00:31:05,445
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Somerville, it's anybody who lives in Somerville can get a permit to park anywhere in Somerville, correct?

374
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:09,337
[SPEAKER_01]: That's surprising, you would think they'd be stricter than that.

375
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we given permits before?

376
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:31,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've done it for other buildings on Riverside Ave in general, we've given permits for some of the cross streets, but there's not a lot of permit parking in this area.

377
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:37,788
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct, we have in the past given some in that area.

378
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:42,829
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not unheard of that we would award a variance for certain areas.

379
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:46,470
[SPEAKER_06]: The same question comes up every single time that we do this.

380
00:31:48,010 --> 00:32:01,413
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we sort of stem the flow of all of these parking private, well not private, but these residential apartment buildings who provide parking but not enough park?

381
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:11,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is the responsibility of the city of Medford when those apartments are on major avenues that you can't park on?

382
00:32:12,902 --> 00:32:16,483
[SPEAKER_06]: So time old question as it relates to this.

383
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:28,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, wait till they start building the actual apartments that we've permitted where we've told them as part of the condition of construction that the residents cannot get permit parking.

384
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:34,926
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been coming through the Community Development Board, but none of those are yet occupied buildings.

385
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:51,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and in this case, if I understand, there's at least someone who indicated to Mr. Gomes that he would be eligible to park on the side streets, but that was probably under a misconception of Somerville versus Medford parking rules.

386
00:32:53,352 --> 00:32:53,592
Right.

387
00:32:58,863 --> 00:33:02,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Spring Street is unrestricted, correct?

388
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:03,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

389
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,848
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he said that he parks there sometimes.

390
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:09,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

391
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:25,639
[SPEAKER_14]: I think if buildings are, you know, building off-street parking lots and, you know, and we're having a permit street-by-street process, I think we have to be careful

392
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:30,538
[SPEAKER_14]: of granting these types of variances.

393
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:39,164
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds like the landlord may have given this person some poor information when he was leasing the apartment.

394
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:44,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Tim, I was just kind of looking at what you were looking at, see what streets are available.

395
00:33:44,427 --> 00:33:53,072
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like Pembroke and Bradshaw and Spring are available, but then some of the others that are a little closer are permanent.

396
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,542
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like there are a handful that are available and restricted.

397
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:06,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I just don't want to place the burden of some poor information from his landlord on to the folks who park on Honeywell and have permits there.

398
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:16,533
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure the public is willing to take on that burden when Spring Street is there available for this situation.

399
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:32,874
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're going to see more of this too in the future because parking doesn't get, we don't get more on-street parking.

400
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:34,394
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't usually work that way.

401
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:45,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I would find it helpful to have a map that I kept at my desk of where the permit parking is in the city, citywide.

402
00:34:45,957 --> 00:34:48,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Todd, if I can throw that your way.

403
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:51,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I just looked it up.

404
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:51,518
[SPEAKER_01]: You got one.

405
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:53,872
[SPEAKER_16]: I just looked at the park department website.

406
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:56,193
[SPEAKER_16]: For some reason, we have the list on there, but not the map.

407
00:34:56,593 --> 00:34:57,834
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to work on that.

408
00:34:57,854 --> 00:34:58,334
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a map.

409
00:34:58,354 --> 00:34:59,054
[SPEAKER_16]: I have one on my wall.

410
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:11,257
[SPEAKER_14]: It's outdated, but I need a new one now that we have the zone, the G zone, and some other things.

411
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:15,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, in this case, Spring Street is pretty closed.

412
00:35:15,499 --> 00:35:20,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, and it has a signalized crosswalks across the street.

413
00:35:32,854 --> 00:35:34,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioners, I leave it to you.

414
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:40,359
[SPEAKER_06]: We have either further debate or to make a motion on this.

415
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:48,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question to clarify.

416
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:52,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Spring Street is fine for him, correct?

417
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But Hunnewell is closer?

418
00:35:57,513 --> 00:36:02,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's my understanding and I believe that is what the petition has indicated.

419
00:36:02,576 --> 00:36:12,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Steve, if you were to walk all the way down Hunnewell and hit Bradshaw, you could park there too.

420
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:28,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I come across as the bad person when it comes to this, but from the beginning, if there's a valid alternative that's reasonably approximate, I'm not big on giving up more city resources just to make it a little bit closer.

421
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think we need to do a better job with educating these building owners.

422
00:36:36,142 --> 00:36:36,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough is enough.

423
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:40,084
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to stop lying to your tenants.

424
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:54,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would support a motion to deny I feel bad doing it but you know as Tim pointed out if we approve this one I was just trying to count the parking spots in the parking lot and we're gonna get ten more people who are gonna petition.

425
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep and there's more coming we can't grow parking spaces on a tree I mean so we got what we got.

426
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:06,884
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just trying to see if I could check.

427
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:16,548
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was an ownership building, which would result in if a unit's being rented.

428
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just checked on Zillow.

429
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:25,392
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a unit sold in 2023.

430
00:37:25,992 --> 00:37:32,155
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an issue of a landlord renting all the units, it's that an individual owner

431
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:34,338
[SPEAKER_01]: is renting out a unit.

432
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:43,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, in the distant future, if the pilot for G works, then presumably there could be a zone in this area at some point.

433
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:51,676
[SPEAKER_16]: And then that could help spread the load, just like we were talking about in the future.

434
00:37:51,696 --> 00:37:53,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the whole city.

435
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, or that too.

436
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

437
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's the right way to put it.

438
00:38:13,463 --> 00:38:16,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And that listing says one deeded parking spot.

439
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:19,607
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a condo building with one spot.

440
00:38:20,027 --> 00:38:30,013
[SPEAKER_01]: So whoever owns this unit said one thing to his tenants, as opposed to us being able to talk to an apartment manager for an apartment building.

441
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:37,677
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll point out there is an MBTA bus for 134 that goes by there that helps the tenants.

442
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:43,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that because you're forecasting my motion to deny, Todd?

443
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:48,170
[SPEAKER_16]: There it is.

444
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Spring Street is really close, too.

445
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:52,011
[SPEAKER_16]: It's less than 500 feet away.

446
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:53,812
[SPEAKER_16]: It has a safe crossing.

447
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:54,912
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

448
00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:56,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, Rafael, but that's my motion.

449
00:38:59,152 --> 00:38:59,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGiven?

450
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for reasons stated, yes.

451
00:39:04,015 --> 00:39:15,583
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Commissioner McGiven, seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski to deny the petition for a variance for Honeywell Ave.

452
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have a roll call vote, please.

453
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:18,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGiven?

454
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:19,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

455
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:20,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

456
00:39:20,846 --> 00:39:21,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

457
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:22,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

458
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:44,464
[SPEAKER_06]: yes yes on the motion on the vote of four to nothing the motion is approved uh mr gomes the uh unfortunately the petition was not successful um we have uh we weigh these uh requests and balancing them against the uh rights of private say

459
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:51,699
[SPEAKER_06]: property owners and the availability of public parking, which is getting less and less as time goes by.

460
00:39:52,179 --> 00:40:00,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I will state that there is availability of parking on Pembroke Street, Bradshaw, and Spring Street, if that helps.

461
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:03,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand it's a few minutes more walking, but

462
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:10,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that based on the vote tonight, that that's where we have to go.

463
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:15,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you understand where we are right now with this petition?

464
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I send him an unmute.

465
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:33,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, can we also advise him that if there's no emergency, he can park on the East Side Streets, where Spring Street is a major item.

466
00:40:34,422 --> 00:40:34,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Galls?

467
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:41,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Gomes, can you unmute yourself?

468
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:44,067
[SPEAKER_01]: He direct messaged me, yes.

469
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:46,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just gonna message him.

470
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:48,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

471
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:55,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And Commissioner Hantia, do you also advise him, as Sasha Rogers points out, should there be a snowstorm or an emergency?

472
00:40:56,578 --> 00:41:00,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Spring Street would be off limits, but he's allowed to park on any of the side streets at that point.

473
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:06,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So he'd be free to, he would be more availability for parking in that case.

474
00:41:09,103 --> 00:41:10,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he wrote back, I understood.

475
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:16,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

476
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:21,729
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-14, no parking at a corner distance of 30 feet on Park Street at Park Street Court.

477
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:24,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Sergeant Rogers, and I believe you have Director Blake to assist you.

478
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:35,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, I've received a couple of complaints on residents from Park Street Court that when they attempt to pull out on the Park Street, the cars are parked so close

479
00:41:37,697 --> 00:41:40,099
[SPEAKER_05]: that they have no view of oncoming traffic.

480
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:47,545
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been near collisions, although I looked up, there have not been any actual collisions.

481
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:58,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking with Director Blake, he came up to put up a sign, Park Street Court looks more like a driveway than a desert street.

482
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,636
[SPEAKER_05]: That would explain why they're parking so close.

483
00:42:04,218 --> 00:42:05,279
[SPEAKER_06]: to it.

484
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:16,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Blake, I believe that is you pulling up the images on the screen, and if you could add your input into this petition also.

485
00:42:16,427 --> 00:42:32,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think when we discussed it, we were saying how it does, even though it's a street, it may be seen as more of a, like this car on the left, Alexis, is treating it more as a driveway, two feet instead of 20 feet.

486
00:42:33,605 --> 00:42:38,870
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I think we had decided if we just signed the 20 foot restriction on either side.

487
00:42:39,511 --> 00:42:42,614
[SPEAKER_16]: That might help with this situation here that's shown.

488
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:53,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And by reference, excuse me, by ordinance and law, there is a 20 feet no parking on every corner.

489
00:42:53,827 --> 00:42:56,149
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for that safety and blind spot.

490
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:07,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And in this case, it doesn't look like it's being honored by certain people parking, but that could be directly related to the fact that it looks more like a driveway than it does look like a side street.

491
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:19,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Director Blake is suggesting that one of the solutions may be simply to sign what is currently the law as it relates to corner parking as no parking on 20 feet as opposed to the 30 feet.

492
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:20,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct, Director Blake?

493
00:43:21,204 --> 00:43:25,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, if that's the case, then there really is no vote if we could just go with the 20.

494
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:31,868
[SPEAKER_16]: But if someone wanted 30, then it would require a vote beyond the 20.

495
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, understood.

496
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:37,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any reason why this intersection needs 20?

497
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:45,486
[SPEAKER_01]: If the problem is that people need 30, if we think the problem is actually people are parking right up to it?

498
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:50,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Sergeant Rogers, you've received the complaints that the original petition came at 30 with 20 work.

499
00:43:52,456 --> 00:44:00,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it would, you can use Todd's line of sight phrase, but I have in trouble.

500
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:07,188
[SPEAKER_05]: The cars are parking almost up to that mailbox and they have no view of Park Street, Southbound.

501
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:16,016
[SPEAKER_16]: It almost looks like there was a sign maybe here at one point years ago, pre-2007.

502
00:44:22,547 --> 00:44:42,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So if Director Blake is suggesting that the petition could be modified to fit the current rule of 20 feet, the Traffic Commission would only really have to vote, and not that we even have to do that, but to have the corners signed appropriately to reflect the rule.

503
00:44:48,377 --> 00:44:53,359
[SPEAKER_16]: You can also enforce, but the sign informs people what will be enforced.

504
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,221
[SPEAKER_16]: You work with Sarah and just enforce as well, I guess.

505
00:44:58,281 --> 00:44:59,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Signage and enforcement.

506
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:01,622
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be more of what we like.

507
00:45:01,683 --> 00:45:03,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioners, questions, thoughts, and concerns?

508
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:06,004
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the sign scene like down there?

509
00:45:06,024 --> 00:45:10,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there signs all over the place, or do you have a low number of signs?

510
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:13,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Todd, do you know?

511
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,213
[SPEAKER_16]: It does not appear that there's many signs.

512
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:27,476
[SPEAKER_16]: This telephone pole's on the opposite side of the street with signs, but it doesn't look like there's any U-channels currently out there, besides the dead-end street name sign.

513
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:31,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

514
00:45:31,377 --> 00:45:34,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Ty, can you go to your screen where you can actually draw distances?

515
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:36,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

516
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:41,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes it's difficult with the trees, but let's see.

517
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:45,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so this tree is blocking up here.

518
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:59,956
[SPEAKER_16]: On this side, you kind of see 20 feet brings you measure from there, brings you like there, and we think it leaves one space between that sign and the driveway.

519
00:46:00,616 --> 00:46:01,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Then same thing on the other side.

520
00:46:02,017 --> 00:46:05,319
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we were trying to be cognizant of what's left over.

521
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:11,722
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you do 20, we think there's enough space, you know,

522
00:46:13,634 --> 00:46:17,057
[SPEAKER_16]: another, you know, it doesn't eliminate all parking on either side.

523
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:17,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

524
00:46:17,637 --> 00:46:25,264
[SPEAKER_16]: So, trying to get an angle that shows how much would be remaining.

525
00:46:25,364 --> 00:46:33,090
[SPEAKER_16]: So, in this block here, Steve, if 20 feet was restricted, there's at least one space left over before the next driveway.

526
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Same thing over here.

527
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,054
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like 20 feet restricted.

528
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:41,918
[SPEAKER_16]: You might have one space remaining instead of this squeezing two in right now.

529
00:46:42,923 --> 00:46:45,004
[SPEAKER_05]: God, where Park Street is a one-way.

530
00:46:45,044 --> 00:46:47,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really concerned where that car is parked over there.

531
00:46:47,984 --> 00:46:48,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, got it.

532
00:46:48,425 --> 00:46:48,865
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

533
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:53,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so only we can start with the approaching side if you wanted to be.

534
00:46:53,306 --> 00:46:55,106
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on them as they pull out to the left.

535
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:56,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

536
00:46:56,667 --> 00:47:01,688
[SPEAKER_16]: So this spot is more because cars are traveling, as Sergeant R just said, this direction.

537
00:47:02,308 --> 00:47:07,850
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's more important for this vehicle exiting to see this direction right here.

538
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,171
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's the spot that we're talking about.

539
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:21,127
[SPEAKER_16]: That is the side that Sergeant Rogers originally had in the agenda, so this is the focus.

540
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:28,934
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so Tim, to your point, it doesn't look like there's many U-channels in the area.

541
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:30,095
[SPEAKER_16]: There's telephone poles.

542
00:47:31,356 --> 00:47:34,398
[SPEAKER_14]: And why can't this problem be solved with enforcement?

543
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:39,483
[SPEAKER_16]: Let the enforcement folks speak.

544
00:47:40,963 --> 00:47:47,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim, I just wanted a sign to point out the law.

545
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:50,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Because obviously they don't get it down there.

546
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:52,705
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a problem spot is what I'm hearing.

547
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:00,527
[SPEAKER_14]: So one sign, go parking here to corner?

548
00:48:01,227 --> 00:48:01,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

549
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:03,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we start with 20 feet?

550
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:04,827
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 feet's the law, right?

551
00:48:05,788 --> 00:48:07,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

552
00:48:07,128 --> 00:48:08,008
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 feet would require us.

553
00:48:09,688 --> 00:48:10,910
[SPEAKER_03]: to grant a variance?

554
00:48:12,331 --> 00:48:22,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, and I thought, Todd, if I'm not mistaken, 30 feet would have some issues with the parking and the driveway.

555
00:48:22,101 --> 00:48:24,503
[SPEAKER_16]: 30, we thought it might impact that second parking space.

556
00:48:24,523 --> 00:48:30,269
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to be sensitive, so 20 might be enough to provide the sight line and still preserve a parking space.

557
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:39,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we start with just, I mean, I know it's the law, but there's a lot of laws I don't know of and I don't mind putting a sign up because I do see them through town.

558
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:42,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we start with 20 and just dedicate a sign?

559
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:45,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim, I don't think, is that an issue to dedicate a sign?

560
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we can't start with 20 and then move to 30 because then we put up two signs.

561
00:48:50,522 --> 00:48:52,043
[SPEAKER_14]: So we should add two signposts.

562
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:53,344
[SPEAKER_14]: So we should pick one.

563
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,065
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 will allow for a parking spot?

564
00:48:55,085 --> 00:48:55,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Todd said no.

565
00:49:02,615 --> 00:49:02,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

566
00:49:02,955 --> 00:49:10,841
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like the 20 feet because that allows somebody to still park there, but it makes it really clear that there's not two parking spots.

567
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:16,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you put it at 30, then you're going to have people like blocking that driveway behind them, right?

568
00:49:16,764 --> 00:49:18,666
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to try and squeeze in anyhow.

569
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:21,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And be like, why can't I park here?

570
00:49:21,748 --> 00:49:25,770
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something I would just ask an engineer, Todd, to tell us where to put it.

571
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,951
[SPEAKER_14]: 20 or 30.

572
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:27,832
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the safest?

573
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:30,053
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about sight distance and safety on that turn.

574
00:49:30,073 --> 00:49:30,113
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

575
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:40,283
[SPEAKER_16]: So are you comfortable with approving it as me and Larry will go through and measure it and mark if we think it's appropriate?

576
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:46,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, 20 or 30 as measured out by the engineering division.

577
00:49:46,964 --> 00:49:47,004
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

578
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:56,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you're seeing one stump is better than two.

579
00:49:56,686 --> 00:49:59,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Sergeant Rogers, are you OK with that if we just give Todd leeway?

580
00:50:01,012 --> 00:50:02,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

581
00:50:02,253 --> 00:50:03,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I want 20 feet.

582
00:50:03,674 --> 00:50:05,275
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not an issue.

583
00:50:06,656 --> 00:50:12,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, before the commission's motion, I just want to make sure nobody in the public wants to speak in this matter.

584
00:50:14,182 --> 00:50:20,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone present who wishes to speak for or against this signage?

585
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:28,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, seeing none, I defer back to the commissioners.

586
00:50:30,317 --> 00:50:36,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And if at all possible, I formulate a quick motion on this to.

587
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:48,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to approve 20 to 30 feet based off of layout by engineering division.

588
00:50:51,764 --> 00:50:52,465
[SPEAKER_06]: With signage.

589
00:50:53,785 --> 00:50:54,425
[SPEAKER_14]: With signage, yep.

590
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:59,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Commissioner McGibbon to approve

591
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:14,233
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-14, giving the Director of Traffic and Engineer the ability to review the layout 20 to 30 feet and sign it appropriately.

592
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:15,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

593
00:51:17,234 --> 00:51:17,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

594
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:22,922
[SPEAKER_06]: seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

595
00:51:23,442 --> 00:51:24,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Bravo roll call.

596
00:51:24,663 --> 00:51:25,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGibbon?

597
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:26,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

598
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:27,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

599
00:51:27,925 --> 00:51:28,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

600
00:51:28,865 --> 00:51:29,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

601
00:51:30,366 --> 00:51:30,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

602
00:51:31,186 --> 00:51:31,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Buckley?

603
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:32,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

604
00:51:32,347 --> 00:51:36,329
[SPEAKER_06]: On a vote of four to nothing, the petition is approved.

605
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:37,910
[SPEAKER_10]: May I ask one question?

606
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,372
[SPEAKER_10]: What corner on Park Street Todd usually gives?

607
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,073
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be the north.

608
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:49,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be the west side of Park Street.

609
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:51,406
[SPEAKER_05]: the north side of Park Street Court.

610
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:56,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Agreed, Director Blake?

611
00:51:57,851 --> 00:52:01,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, west side of Park, 20 to 30 feet north of Park Court.

612
00:52:05,777 --> 00:52:06,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

613
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:10,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

614
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:15,184
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-15, Salem Street Municipal Parking Lot, Designate Business Parking Only.

615
00:52:15,805 --> 00:52:18,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Special Projects Coordinator Jim Silva, the floor is yours.

616
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:37,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we spoke of this last meeting in regards to some of the abutters that were interested in how the status of this law changed from a municipal public parking lot to a special type of status to allow parking.

617
00:52:37,994 --> 00:52:46,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our understanding that the assessor's office denoted this as a property owned by Verizon and not the city of Medford.

618
00:52:47,238 --> 00:53:03,060
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time, it was recommended that we would change the status for that special parking program, which is business slash health care at this point versus deriving income from a property we don't own.

619
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:06,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So the designation was changed.

620
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:18,811
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want an official perspective on this and on the books as a business slash or business parking lot, which allows health care folks to park in there as well.

621
00:53:22,253 --> 00:53:24,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so no real change.

622
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:27,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Just trying to memorialize the traffic commission.

623
00:53:27,477 --> 00:53:30,339
[SPEAKER_06]: What is currently in place that fair enough?

624
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:36,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't miss that all together.

625
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:44,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, I thought we'd voted on this already, so.

626
00:53:47,785 --> 00:53:49,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I guess that's my question.

627
00:53:50,106 --> 00:53:57,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I guess maybe I thought we were told we couldn't do it, so I may have assumed we didn't even need to vote.

628
00:53:57,428 --> 00:53:59,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have any jurisdiction here, if it's not our lot?

629
00:54:00,148 --> 00:54:00,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

630
00:54:06,861 --> 00:54:08,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's a point of clarification.

631
00:54:08,622 --> 00:54:10,502
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not the city's lot.

632
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:11,382
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not our lot.

633
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:28,488
[SPEAKER_01]: National Grid owns it, but my understanding is they've given us permission to use it for public parking, but the problem is that the assessor has concerns about us making money off of something that we don't own.

634
00:54:28,908 --> 00:54:30,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

635
00:54:31,229 --> 00:54:34,950
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a written operating agreement or lease agreement with the lot?

636
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:35,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

637
00:54:36,842 --> 00:54:39,665
[SPEAKER_02]: We need 1, this was somewhat of a discovery.

638
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:42,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was a lot of back taxes that were involved.

639
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I sort of.

640
00:54:47,544 --> 00:54:57,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been waiting for a little bit of information, but again, I think we were acting prudently to not to derive income off this particular location.

641
00:54:57,512 --> 00:55:00,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly they provided the lot to the City of Medford.

642
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:07,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a special program is doable in case there's any issue or pushback.

643
00:55:08,732 --> 00:55:10,874
[SPEAKER_03]: But the health care use, who is that?

644
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:12,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that for the group across the street?

645
00:55:13,696 --> 00:55:15,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, it's for health care workers.

646
00:55:16,198 --> 00:55:28,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you all voted on including health care pass holders to park in business parking throughout the city as an additional location.

647
00:55:28,609 --> 00:55:30,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, health care pass.

648
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're in a special program as well.

649
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:41,251
[SPEAKER_03]: But one last question, I promise to leave you alone, but we can't give the owner of the after school care.

650
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:46,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Use of a space in this lot from my understanding.

651
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:46,178
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

652
00:55:48,903 --> 00:56:01,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there could be a petition for that, but actually, if you look at the next item on the list, we've included some additional parking or some potential changes in that location that seem to satisfy the abutter.

653
00:56:02,366 --> 00:56:06,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let Sarah speak on that in the next step, but that seems to work for her.

654
00:56:06,686 --> 00:56:13,868
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some business parking that we could not find the history of that on Salem Street, the street itself.

655
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:24,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So we pulled that business parking off there, made it just metered parking for public and moved the business people into the business.

656
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,511
[SPEAKER_02]: So we sort of swapped out when we made this change last year.

657
00:56:29,371 --> 00:56:34,532
[SPEAKER_01]: But she and her employees could get business permits and could park there.

658
00:56:34,712 --> 00:56:38,453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just available to her clients as a public.

659
00:56:38,993 --> 00:56:39,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

660
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:39,873
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

661
00:56:40,073 --> 00:56:40,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

662
00:56:42,175 --> 00:56:45,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if this is just memorializing exactly what's going on motion.

663
00:56:47,263 --> 00:56:47,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

664
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:49,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, Tim.

665
00:56:50,848 --> 00:56:57,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we don't want to preclude any potential agreement between a private landowner in the city.

666
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:01,615
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're the authority on off-street parking lots.

667
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:03,396
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is not an off-street parking lot.

668
00:57:03,956 --> 00:57:10,679
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a private parking lot that has a handshake agreement between the city and a private entity.

669
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:22,683
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we should do, I believe, and I'm obviously not the only one on this commission, we should probably advise the mayor to enter an agreement if she hasn't already

670
00:57:25,865 --> 00:57:30,428
[SPEAKER_14]: And then to give us her view over the parking lot in that agreement.

671
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:36,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that agreement can solve a lot of issues here, like the people next door and you parking that child place or whatever.

672
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:39,535
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we don't want to preclude anything that.

673
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:42,717
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor might want to do an agreement with this other.

674
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,739
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's my stance on this.

675
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:45,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think we have authority anyway.

676
00:57:46,682 --> 00:57:57,690
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do believe that part of the problem is that they've been trying to get an agreement for a while, and National Grid actually moves more slowly than government.

677
00:57:59,271 --> 00:58:01,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody should be parking there in the meantime.

678
00:58:02,374 --> 00:58:03,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

679
00:58:03,454 --> 00:58:09,839
[SPEAKER_14]: So it might stay at a handshake back of the envelope agreement for a little while, but it really needs to be inked.

680
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:14,983
[SPEAKER_06]: As chair, I suggest that this

681
00:58:19,383 --> 00:58:20,844
[SPEAKER_06]: parking at municipal parking lots.

682
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:23,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see how this falls under either.

683
00:58:25,146 --> 00:58:29,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was my secondary point, which I don't even think we have any authority here.

684
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:39,114
[SPEAKER_14]: If the mayor gives us authority through an agreement that she signs with another entity that says the Traffic Commission has purview over it as a public parking lot, so be it, then we do.

685
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:44,998
[SPEAKER_03]: But didn't Jim say that we have done something in the past on this lot already?

686
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:46,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Mistakenly.

687
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,100
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought the city owned it.

688
00:58:56,022 --> 00:58:57,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we know the city doesn't own it.

689
00:58:58,683 --> 00:59:01,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

690
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:04,366
[SPEAKER_03]: As an attorney, I definitely support Tim's position.

691
00:59:04,446 --> 00:59:12,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love for us to get some operating agreement in place, particularly that at night you can actually lease it out to all the people coming to the Chevalier, but we don't have that.

692
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:17,252
[SPEAKER_03]: To the extent it's not applicable, let's get rid of it and move on.

693
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:24,464
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe this is a question for Alva, but could we generate a recommendation through the mayor via traffic commission?

694
00:59:27,805 --> 00:59:29,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim, that's an interesting point.

695
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:38,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually suggest that if the mayor enters an agreement with a private entity regarding parking, she can just do that on her own and would not even need traffic commission approval.

696
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:41,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, she doesn't need our approval.

697
00:59:41,073 --> 00:59:44,434
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my first point was we shouldn't preclude anything that the mayor would do.

698
00:59:44,955 --> 00:59:57,879
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we say we voted, like if we said we're memorializing this into, you know, business parking, and then later on she enters an agreement with that entity that contradicts that, then, you know, we're kind of in a problem.

699
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:03,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Or if we have to unwind that so she can make some sort of agreement, even though we don't have authority.

700
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,301
[SPEAKER_14]: It just creates a mess that we don't need to create.

701
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:07,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Agreed.

702
01:00:09,102 --> 01:00:19,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And that goes along with the, we don't have the authority type stuff, but what I suggested that the mayor did enter an agreement, she would have the authority to basically say, we can allow a business parking here.

703
01:00:19,406 --> 01:00:26,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a non-regulatory issue for the Traffic Commission and it's private property with an agreement.

704
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:28,710
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know that this has to come back to us at all.

705
01:00:33,372 --> 01:00:34,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt?

706
01:00:35,212 --> 01:00:36,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm just clearing my throat.

707
01:00:43,596 --> 01:00:55,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm concerned that any decision by us tonight might be set aside when this is memorialized between a private entity and the city.

708
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we can place on file and

709
01:01:11,129 --> 01:01:13,051
[SPEAKER_14]: inform the mayor that we placed on file?

710
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:16,934
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

711
01:01:17,955 --> 01:01:23,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll make a motion to inform the mayor that we placed on file.

712
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:25,181
[SPEAKER_14]: In other words, inform the mayor we took no action on it.

713
01:01:28,183 --> 01:01:33,208
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Commissioner McGibbon to place petition 2025-15 on file, do I have a second?

714
01:01:33,228 --> 01:01:33,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

715
01:01:39,803 --> 01:01:41,305
[SPEAKER_06]: seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

716
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:44,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGibbon?

717
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:44,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

718
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:46,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

719
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:46,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

720
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:48,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

721
01:01:49,017 --> 01:01:49,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

722
01:01:50,077 --> 01:01:50,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief Buckley.

723
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:56,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, on the vote of four nothing petition has been placed on file 2025-16.

724
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:04,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Change the spaces in front of 36 Salem Street from 30 minutes to two hours and replace time monitor devices with standard meter heads.

725
01:02:05,202 --> 01:02:09,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Special projects coordinator Jim Silva, the floor is again yours.

726
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:19,252
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the spaces in front of Pure Hockey that are currently the three spaces that have the monitoring devices.

727
01:02:21,293 --> 01:02:30,238
[SPEAKER_02]: In the request for the abutter to the business parking lot, wanted to ensure that there was at least two-hour parking.

728
01:02:30,598 --> 01:02:33,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn this over to Sarah.

729
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,982
[SPEAKER_02]: She had a conversation with the Pure Hockey folks as well.

730
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:39,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

731
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Director McDermott, the floor is yours.

732
01:02:52,992 --> 01:02:54,113
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't hear you.

733
01:02:55,594 --> 01:02:56,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless that's me.

734
01:02:57,096 --> 01:02:57,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't hear either.

735
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:01,519
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard you earlier.

736
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:02,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's strange.

737
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:03,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?

738
01:03:03,922 --> 01:03:04,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we do.

739
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:04,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

740
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:05,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

741
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:30,041
[SPEAKER_08]: So I reached out to Pure Hockey, the manager of Pure Hockey, since the last Traffic Commission meeting, and they have no objection to us changing the meters, the three spaces out front from 30-minute free parking to two-hour paid metered parking, because they have so much parking in the back of their store, which they seem to believe people know about and utilize regularly.

742
01:03:30,141 --> 01:03:36,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So additionally, I spoke to our meter foreperson, Mike Viola, and we do have

743
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:44,252
[SPEAKER_08]: the necessary equipment to swap those meters out and change them without any cost to the city with what we already have in inventory.

744
01:03:44,272 --> 01:03:52,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see no reason not to make this change as it will satisfy

745
01:03:53,683 --> 01:04:04,311
[SPEAKER_08]: the request of the business there who lost that lot for their customers unexpectedly and, you know, involuntarily, which by everybody.

746
01:04:04,391 --> 01:04:09,896
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's a reasonable request on her part and I'm supportive of it.

747
01:04:11,457 --> 01:04:12,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's really all I've got to say.

748
01:04:13,018 --> 01:04:14,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any questions about it?

749
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:15,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

750
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:18,443
[SPEAKER_16]: We also want to add this space here.

751
01:04:23,616 --> 01:04:28,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if, Todd, I'm all for adding that space if the measurements are correct.

752
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:38,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if we have the inventory or the equipment to add a meter there, but we can always make it something if there's enough room.

753
01:04:38,489 --> 01:04:48,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Todd, that curb was original, just a new curb added to that location.

754
01:04:52,634 --> 01:04:57,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it looks like there was some work done when that business was rehabbed.

755
01:04:58,158 --> 01:05:04,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the curb cut used to be right here, kind of on the edge of this parking lot we were talking about earlier.

756
01:05:05,843 --> 01:05:09,525
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it is all the way over here.

757
01:05:10,226 --> 01:05:10,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Wonderful.

758
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:16,330
[SPEAKER_16]: So we may be able to stripe this a little differently and fit to and add a space here.

759
01:05:16,987 --> 01:05:19,768
[SPEAKER_16]: But I don't think, yeah, my apologies for jumping the gun.

760
01:05:19,788 --> 01:05:24,650
[SPEAKER_16]: We were talking about these three over here, but it's related, so.

761
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:27,392
[SPEAKER_16]: So these three.

762
01:05:27,412 --> 01:05:41,178
[SPEAKER_06]: So commissioners, in dealing with it, let's talk about the three spaces, 36 South Street.

763
01:05:43,059 --> 01:05:45,700
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears to resolve some of our

764
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,106
[SPEAKER_06]: before I go to the public.

765
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I see none.

766
01:05:57,691 --> 01:06:00,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone in the public have a wish to address that?

767
01:06:01,936 --> 01:06:02,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a question.

768
01:06:02,597 --> 01:06:03,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm slow.

769
01:06:05,179 --> 01:06:10,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we made this known to Pure Hockey, like all the kind of abutting businesses?

770
01:06:12,308 --> 01:06:14,609
[SPEAKER_08]: your hockey right now is the only a budding business.

771
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:17,769
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no other business in the building where the village play spaces.

772
01:06:18,589 --> 01:06:23,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and that's the only other building or the only other business on that block.

773
01:06:24,591 --> 01:06:25,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

774
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:25,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

775
01:06:26,491 --> 01:06:29,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have no objection repeating what you said earlier, correct?

776
01:06:29,672 --> 01:06:30,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

777
01:06:30,092 --> 01:06:30,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

778
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:31,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

779
01:06:31,132 --> 01:06:31,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

780
01:06:36,217 --> 01:06:41,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone in the public wish to speak to, for, or against petition 2025-16?

781
01:06:41,859 --> 01:06:55,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, commissioners, I leave it to you for a motion for further discussion.

782
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:06,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I would move to approve these as two-hour spots and include the additional spot if there is, in fact, engineering agrees the space is there.

783
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they just said, but I know.

784
01:07:12,575 --> 01:07:34,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so on the motion of Commissioner Hart to approve 2025-16, which would change the spaces on 36 Salem Street from 30 minutes to two hours parking, and replace the monitor devices with standard meter heads, and to include the one or possibly two additional parking spaces just forward of them.

785
01:07:34,773 --> 01:07:35,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

786
01:07:36,434 --> 01:07:36,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

787
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:38,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Commissioner McGiven.

788
01:07:38,996 --> 01:07:41,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Outlaw, full call, please.

789
01:07:42,589 --> 01:07:43,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGibbon?

790
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

791
01:07:45,091 --> 01:07:45,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

792
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:47,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

793
01:07:47,853 --> 01:07:49,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

794
01:07:49,474 --> 01:07:49,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

795
01:07:50,595 --> 01:07:51,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Buckley?

796
01:07:51,415 --> 01:07:51,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

797
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,357
[SPEAKER_06]: On the vote of four to nothing, the motion is approved.

798
01:07:54,377 --> 01:07:54,397
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-17.

799
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:59,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief, could we take 2025-19 out of order because the petitioner needs to leave to go back to work?

800
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:19,658
[SPEAKER_06]: We shortly end on the request of Commissioner Hunt to take the motion on order 2025-19, permit parking variance from Mr. Richard Koenigsmann, 23 Burgett Ave.

801
01:08:20,118 --> 01:08:24,221
If the petitioner is present, we're gonna ask you to unmute and the floor will be yours.

802
01:08:26,383 --> 01:08:27,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the Traffic Commission.

803
01:08:27,924 --> 01:08:31,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, thanks for having me.

804
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:32,841
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, sir?

805
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:35,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for coming and presenting before us.

806
01:08:35,843 --> 01:08:40,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to give us a little description and understanding of your request?

807
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:42,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you.

808
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:50,595
[SPEAKER_12]: So I am running an internship in Boston and in the Boston church.

809
01:08:51,596 --> 01:08:58,982
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got a car from the Boston church, which is a commercial car, but it is unlettered.

810
01:09:00,944 --> 01:09:11,554
[SPEAKER_12]: receiving multiple parking tickets I realized that I'm not allowed to park an unlettered and a commercial car overnight in Medford.

811
01:09:12,755 --> 01:09:18,020
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would like to request a parking variance in Medford.

812
01:09:20,267 --> 01:09:21,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

813
01:09:21,348 --> 01:09:28,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for presenting that and I'm going to go to the commissioners if you could just stand by potentially answer any questions they might have.

814
01:09:29,452 --> 01:09:34,014
[SPEAKER_06]: To the commissioners, the petitioner has presented his certificate of registration.

815
01:09:34,075 --> 01:09:36,436
[SPEAKER_06]: It is on a 2014 Ford Focus.

816
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:45,841
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have commercial plates, but as the petitioner has indicated, there are no other markings indicating traditional commercial vehicles.

817
01:09:45,861 --> 01:09:47,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

818
01:09:51,847 --> 01:10:00,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any question about permit parking in this area or is this simply an issue of being allowed to park overnight?

819
01:10:01,494 --> 01:10:03,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is a permit parking street.

820
01:10:06,718 --> 01:10:08,760
[SPEAKER_01]: A resident permit.

821
01:10:10,441 --> 01:10:14,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe he said he had a commercial plate or a commercial vehicle.

822
01:10:16,265 --> 01:10:16,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

823
01:10:16,606 --> 01:10:18,067
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it registered in Medford?

824
01:10:19,975 --> 01:10:22,596
[SPEAKER_06]: it is registered technically out of Framingham.

825
01:10:23,096 --> 01:10:24,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

826
01:10:24,496 --> 01:10:25,897
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this problem, right?

827
01:10:26,037 --> 01:10:34,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It's both that it's commercial, but it's not just commercial plates, it's that he's parking in the G zone.

828
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:46,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that just granting the commercial isn't good enough, he also needs permission to park in the G zone.

829
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:58,216
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is exactly one of the type of reason that I've brought up that we ought to have some rulings to allow commercial vehicles because sometimes it is your transportation.

830
01:10:58,236 --> 01:11:05,641
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it's a commercial truck that ought to be kept in the parking lot of your business.

831
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:12,104
[SPEAKER_01]: It's provided to him to drive between his business and do his internship.

832
01:11:14,386 --> 01:11:14,626
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

833
01:11:15,454 --> 01:11:23,981
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may, there's also the question, if it's in framing or something, not being a Medford registration, we don't get this excise tax.

834
01:11:24,102 --> 01:11:26,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, it looks like that host has a driveway.

835
01:11:26,804 --> 01:11:31,968
[SPEAKER_16]: So is there a reason why they can't use the driveway and whoever doesn't have the commercial park on the street?

836
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:39,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Mr. Collins, can you speak to that?

837
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:43,512
[SPEAKER_06]: As director Blake indicates, there appears to be a driveway.

838
01:11:43,552 --> 01:11:44,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you park in the driveway?

839
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:45,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a possibility?

840
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:50,259
[SPEAKER_12]: No, parking in the driveway is not a possibility.

841
01:11:50,719 --> 01:12:03,472
[SPEAKER_12]: The house I'm living in, the household, is divided in two apartments, and the driveway is only accessible for half of the apartment.

842
01:12:09,734 --> 01:12:12,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you for that response.

843
01:12:14,256 --> 01:12:16,277
[SPEAKER_06]: To the Commissioner, this is an age-old question.

844
01:12:16,337 --> 01:12:21,899
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep getting, you know, here and there we get these requests for people to park their commercial vehicles on our streets.

845
01:12:22,499 --> 01:12:26,981
[SPEAKER_06]: We have had a long-standing rule against commercial, no overnight commercial parking.

846
01:12:29,082 --> 01:12:32,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Does not make this an easy question for debate.

847
01:12:35,648 --> 01:12:38,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we have this last week?

848
01:12:39,194 --> 01:12:39,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Or last month?

849
01:12:43,251 --> 01:12:50,476
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it look like on Boston Ave or just trying to look at the agenda or the minutes?

850
01:12:50,836 --> 01:12:52,978
[SPEAKER_01]: This has come up before.

851
01:12:53,418 --> 01:13:01,884
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a young man who had an actual work van with tools and stuff and he lived at his parents' house.

852
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:06,428
[SPEAKER_01]: His parents were like, we need the driveway and he needs to park on the street.

853
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,201
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we approved that one.

854
01:13:10,961 --> 01:13:11,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

855
01:13:11,421 --> 01:13:20,683
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just going to say, I mean, didn't the gentleman from last month, I want to say we denied it, but I'm just trying to straighten the table a bit.

856
01:13:20,723 --> 01:13:26,805
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the gentleman who lives on his corner house on Holton and Hobbit and he has that big

857
01:13:27,385 --> 01:13:29,527
[SPEAKER_06]: driveway and back, and he has his commercial vehicles.

858
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:32,849
[SPEAKER_06]: We did table that for similar concerns.

859
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:38,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I will add to Commissioner Hunt, because you actually reminded me of something.

860
01:13:38,233 --> 01:13:48,401
[SPEAKER_06]: We did approve that, and that was probably maybe two years ago, but it turned out to be a problem because I believe the parking department was not able to do what we had approved.

861
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:51,964
[SPEAKER_06]: So based on that, I'm going to see if

862
01:13:52,764 --> 01:13:54,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Director McDermott could weigh in on this.

863
01:13:54,929 --> 01:14:00,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it possible to grant the variance to a commercial motor vehicle plate for resident permit parking?

864
01:14:01,184 --> 01:14:02,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that's what...

865
01:14:03,174 --> 01:14:08,377
[SPEAKER_06]: prevented us from doing it the last time, and it was a very much debated issue either way.

866
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:14,760
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you're new here to the city right now, but I don't know if that's a possibility to the system.

867
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:23,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you put a commercial motor vehicle that's registered outside of the city into our system and give them a resident private parking pass?

868
01:14:29,927 --> 01:14:30,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me, Sarah?

869
01:14:35,226 --> 01:14:36,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, we can't hear you.

870
01:14:36,207 --> 01:14:36,487
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

871
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:43,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

872
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:45,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we got you.

873
01:14:45,451 --> 01:14:47,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what's up with that.

874
01:14:47,432 --> 01:14:48,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, everybody.

875
01:14:49,053 --> 01:14:49,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're very low.

876
01:14:49,893 --> 01:14:50,734
[SPEAKER_04]: We can barely hear you.

877
01:14:51,234 --> 01:14:52,655
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear you, but it's really low.

878
01:14:57,957 --> 01:15:01,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you how to raise the volume on it if you don't know, but.

879
01:15:01,659 --> 01:15:02,780
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one note.

880
01:15:06,182 --> 01:15:07,363
[SPEAKER_08]: things maxed out.

881
01:15:07,983 --> 01:15:10,064
[SPEAKER_08]: My microphone is at the highest volume.

882
01:15:13,246 --> 01:15:16,367
[SPEAKER_01]: The fraction of an inch you leaned in, you got much louder.

883
01:15:17,268 --> 01:15:19,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you're just going to have to stare at my face.

884
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:20,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me now?

885
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,551
[SPEAKER_06]: We have you now, yes.

886
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:26,592
[SPEAKER_08]: We can issue a permit really to any car.

887
01:15:26,853 --> 01:15:33,136
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a matter of not doing it because it's setting a precedent and that's going to be the one exception

888
01:15:34,609 --> 01:15:36,891
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a car that isn't garaged in Medford.

889
01:15:38,052 --> 01:15:40,814
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a commercial vehicle getting a variance.

890
01:15:41,475 --> 01:15:43,796
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got two variances it's requesting.

891
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:52,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Because generally, if we're issuing a residential permit, that car is garaged at a Medford address.

892
01:15:53,164 --> 01:15:57,808
[SPEAKER_08]: The person doesn't have to live in Medford per se, but that car has to live in Medford.

893
01:15:58,966 --> 01:16:02,208
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can do most anything.

894
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:09,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I could register a car from Florida with a Medford permit, but we don't as a general rule.

895
01:16:11,774 --> 01:16:14,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that clear explanation.

896
01:16:16,336 --> 01:16:17,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go back.

897
01:16:19,225 --> 01:16:25,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, I think it may be maybe a third permit to Sarah, like Alicia was saying, there's also the resident permit piece of it.

898
01:16:25,851 --> 01:16:31,556
[SPEAKER_16]: So even if you got past the garage code in the commercial, they can park on St.

899
01:16:31,616 --> 01:16:33,558
[SPEAKER_16]: George Street and non G zone.

900
01:16:33,878 --> 01:16:37,821
[SPEAKER_16]: But then if you want to G zone on Burgett, then that's a third thing.

901
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:42,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Because George Street, I was trying to highlight on the map, it's only about 400 feet away.

902
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:44,247
[SPEAKER_16]: It's non resident street.

903
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:49,376
[SPEAKER_06]: but G-Zone would allow this commercial vehicle to park anywhere.

904
01:16:50,056 --> 01:16:53,298
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already sort of ruled on it if we grant this petition.

905
01:16:55,158 --> 01:17:02,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief, is there an ordinance that was passed by city council that says specifically that you can't park a commercial vehicle overnight?

906
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:04,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious about that.

907
01:17:04,642 --> 01:17:07,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we try to do a little bit of research in regards to that.

908
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the argument in the past.

909
01:17:10,661 --> 01:17:11,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

910
01:17:11,101 --> 01:17:16,842
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an ordinance in place that does not allow commercial motor vehicles to park overnight in the city.

911
01:17:19,663 --> 01:17:20,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Passed in 2002.

912
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:23,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Coordinator Alva passed in 2002.

913
01:17:23,924 --> 01:17:36,788
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, practically, even though he said the driveway space is associated with the other unit, he could potentially have a private conversation between the two units and work out some deal.

914
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:42,384
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, because there wouldn't be an issue with the other unit getting a G zone permit if it's a residential car.

915
01:17:44,084 --> 01:17:45,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Valid point, Director Blake.

916
01:17:47,045 --> 01:17:48,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me do some business here.

917
01:17:48,685 --> 01:17:53,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone in the public here who wishes to speak for or against this petition?

918
01:17:53,726 --> 01:17:59,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Just raise a hand, wave.

919
01:18:00,847 --> 01:18:04,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, I'd like to go back to the petitioner.

920
01:18:06,995 --> 01:18:14,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you understand what's been said so far and the concerns that the Traffic Commission have?

921
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:21,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you have any questions of us at this time, Mr. Collins?

922
01:18:23,567 --> 01:18:24,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you.

923
01:18:24,668 --> 01:18:26,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I do understand everything.

924
01:18:26,689 --> 01:18:36,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe to answer the question that was posed, having a conversation

925
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:53,611
[SPEAKER_12]: with other people parking in the driveway, be helpful because I believe the other household has, I think up to five, and my household has five people as well.

926
01:18:54,472 --> 01:18:58,876
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's no spot for me.

927
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:06,442
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing I'd offer is, or for consideration for the commission,

928
01:19:07,316 --> 01:19:20,546
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm just stating what I think may contribute is someone having, you know, generally not the specific, someone having a vehicle given to them by any business that they work for in Medford or elsewhere.

929
01:19:21,026 --> 01:19:23,028
[SPEAKER_16]: That's like a perk for that employee, right?

930
01:19:24,289 --> 01:19:29,113
[SPEAKER_16]: So some things are positive, like a perk to have use of a car that you don't have to pay for yourself.

931
01:19:29,293 --> 01:19:33,236
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there are some negatives like this, like maybe not having somewhere to park.

932
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:36,038
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's something just to consider.

933
01:19:37,235 --> 01:19:40,138
[SPEAKER_16]: In terms of in general, because it could be precedent setting type thing.

934
01:19:41,038 --> 01:19:45,622
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's it's a perk to get a company car because you save on gas saving on all these other things.

935
01:19:45,642 --> 01:19:46,122
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe.

936
01:19:46,142 --> 01:19:52,427
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I don't know if that outweighs the perk of paying for private parking somewhere or not, but something consider.

937
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,190
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an ordinance, right?

938
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:58,632
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not even sure if we have an authority to grant grant variance to an ordinance.

939
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:04,597
[SPEAKER_14]: We can grant variances to traffic rules and regulations and parking rules and regulations and stuff like that, but not.

940
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:10,232
[SPEAKER_14]: from my understanding of our purview, if it's an ordinance thing.

941
01:20:11,513 --> 01:20:12,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't disagree with that.

942
01:20:12,954 --> 01:20:25,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I would still suggest we would have to deny the petition based on those facts, but... Commissioner Kavinsky, Commissioner Hunt, any further questions for discussion of the petition?

943
01:20:26,884 --> 01:20:43,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Sarah's point about the car, not the person, was really salient to me because if this person, say, goes away and this car is then, you know, retains ownership, then they may assign it to somebody else in Medford and then we lost track of it.

944
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:46,303
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's a really important point.

945
01:20:47,306 --> 01:20:48,346
[SPEAKER_14]: So we gotta get our act together.

946
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:49,247
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're in the same position.

947
01:20:49,287 --> 01:20:54,688
[SPEAKER_14]: We gotta get our act together before we can grant these types of permissions in general, if we have the authority.

948
01:20:54,748 --> 01:20:57,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would motion to deny at this point.

949
01:20:57,309 --> 01:21:08,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on a motion of commission, I'm gonna give it to deny petition 2025-19 for permit parking variance for commercial motor vehicle.

950
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:10,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

951
01:21:14,154 --> 01:21:14,574
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll second.

952
01:21:15,805 --> 01:21:17,626
[SPEAKER_06]: seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

953
01:21:18,426 --> 01:21:19,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Alba, roll call, please.

954
01:21:19,967 --> 01:21:20,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGibbon?

955
01:21:21,468 --> 01:21:21,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

956
01:21:22,728 --> 01:21:23,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

957
01:21:24,489 --> 01:21:24,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

958
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:26,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

959
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:27,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

960
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:28,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief Buckley?

961
01:21:29,271 --> 01:21:30,952
[SPEAKER_06]: For all the reasons stated, yes.

962
01:21:31,272 --> 01:21:32,672
[SPEAKER_06]: On a vote of four, nothing.

963
01:21:33,253 --> 01:21:35,634
[SPEAKER_06]: The petition is denied.

964
01:21:36,814 --> 01:21:39,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Kohnsman, you indicated that you did understand

965
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:53,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Your request comes with many variables that would be contrary to the rules, plus we have an ordinance in the city that would deny this.

966
01:21:53,465 --> 01:22:05,812
[SPEAKER_06]: So with apologies and my thanks for you presenting this evening and being eloquent and understanding, I wish you a good night and I'm sorry that we could not help you out.

967
01:22:07,525 --> 01:22:14,351
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-17 Clippership Lot Agreement for Solid Waste Storage and Pickup.

968
01:22:14,831 --> 01:22:15,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner McGibbon.

969
01:22:15,652 --> 01:22:16,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

970
01:22:16,693 --> 01:22:20,736
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so this is similar to what we did in Haines.

971
01:22:20,776 --> 01:22:33,667
[SPEAKER_14]: That one actually didn't end up panning out, but if I could share my screen, there's a lot called the Clippership Lot, and there's a building owner by the name of the Hamilton Company.

972
01:22:35,387 --> 01:22:42,012
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you can see those four dumpsters there, those are not, I guess, they're not really legal.

973
01:22:42,032 --> 01:22:50,460
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not under any sort of agreement with the city, but the parking spaces are public parking spaces there that the dumpsters are in.

974
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:56,165
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a part of our public parking arsenal that isn't really used all that much.

975
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:06,050
[SPEAKER_14]: If you can see over near that white van, there is a parking kiosk that you can't see on the other side of that van.

976
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me just show you this at a couple other angles.

977
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:14,454
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically what's happening is Ebisuya, which is the Japanese market, it is in this building.

978
01:23:14,895 --> 01:23:18,797
[SPEAKER_14]: It creates a ton of recycling boxes, basically.

979
01:23:19,277 --> 01:23:23,259
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've driven around the square at five in the morning on a Tuesday,

980
01:23:24,081 --> 01:23:25,603
[SPEAKER_14]: A morning, you know what I'm talking about.

981
01:23:25,643 --> 01:23:26,804
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a mountain of boxes.

982
01:23:27,004 --> 01:23:30,928
[SPEAKER_14]: So they want to put another dumpster back here during that process.

983
01:23:31,028 --> 01:23:31,949
[SPEAKER_14]: It was discovered that.

984
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:37,474
[SPEAKER_14]: These dumpsters here are not under any sort of agreement.

985
01:23:38,836 --> 01:23:47,384
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is a city lot, so I would like to ask permission from the commission to enter an agreement with the.

986
01:23:49,603 --> 01:23:53,425
[SPEAKER_14]: with the building owner to use this area for trash storage.

987
01:23:53,485 --> 01:23:55,306
[SPEAKER_14]: They have no other area, by the way.

988
01:23:55,426 --> 01:23:56,727
[SPEAKER_14]: This building is sort of landlocked.

989
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:58,287
[SPEAKER_14]: They have an easement in the back.

990
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:01,834
[SPEAKER_14]: In this picture, actually, we're looking at the easement.

991
01:24:01,854 --> 01:24:04,016
[SPEAKER_14]: The easement goes out a little bit.

992
01:24:04,496 --> 01:24:05,858
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a geometric easement.

993
01:24:05,878 --> 01:24:22,514
[SPEAKER_14]: In other words, it's drawn on the plan, but the text of the agreement is actually what's more important because it allows the building to have access to the parking lot for deliveries and access to its site.

994
01:24:26,147 --> 01:24:34,210
[SPEAKER_14]: For what it's worth, it's kind of like this land that is used for both public parking and the use of the building.

995
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:37,531
[SPEAKER_14]: As you can see, there's a loading dock that goes through here, goes through the public parking lot.

996
01:24:38,751 --> 01:24:41,072
[SPEAKER_14]: So, let me just go look at this one more picture here.

997
01:24:41,092 --> 01:24:42,472
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

998
01:24:42,492 --> 01:24:44,673
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see the loading area here that they use.

999
01:24:44,733 --> 01:24:46,433
[SPEAKER_14]: That is actually public parking lot area.

1000
01:24:46,733 --> 01:24:48,214
[SPEAKER_14]: The property line kind of

1001
01:24:49,092 --> 01:24:50,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Goes through here right here.

1002
01:24:50,572 --> 01:24:57,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess you can't see my cursor, but it's off about 15 feet from that wall that you're looking at.

1003
01:24:57,714 --> 01:25:03,535
[SPEAKER_06]: How many spaces, Tim, would you be using in the public lot?

1004
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:09,837
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know exactly how many spaces, but it's probably

1005
01:25:11,455 --> 01:25:15,398
[SPEAKER_14]: three or four, so I put the picture up that I think best shows that.

1006
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:28,266
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not even sure if they're striped for spaces, and I'm not really sure the full history of this spot, but I know, as far as I can remember, there's been dumpsters here.

1007
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:31,929
[SPEAKER_14]: The CVS, I think, had a dumpster here when CVS was there.

1008
01:25:35,285 --> 01:25:37,606
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I'd like to do is formalize an agreement.

1009
01:25:37,626 --> 01:25:39,146
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see if I can get some screening up.

1010
01:25:39,687 --> 01:25:44,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see if I can get, to get it to look a little bit nicer.

1011
01:25:44,588 --> 01:25:53,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Tim, it looks like back to 2011, it was always used for the dumpsters.

1012
01:25:53,672 --> 01:25:56,933
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's as far as back street view goes.

1013
01:25:57,948 --> 01:26:10,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and like I said, it's on the edge of their easement land, which basically gives them access loading, unloading, drive-through connection to Clippership lot and all that.

1014
01:26:10,897 --> 01:26:17,001
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the building owner has taken it upon themselves to just use the area for those purposes.

1015
01:26:19,777 --> 01:26:30,707
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I just want to formalize it into an agreement because it is partially lying on city public parking lot and see if I can get some screening up and make a nicer agreement for the for the city.

1016
01:26:32,028 --> 01:26:39,254
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, from another angle to my verify that since as far back as 2007, it's been used as you're describing.

1017
01:26:39,795 --> 01:26:41,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think it goes all the way back to when.

1018
01:26:42,737 --> 01:26:44,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, when it was created when the easement was created.

1019
01:26:46,437 --> 01:26:49,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that area actually big enough for parking spots?

1020
01:26:49,398 --> 01:27:00,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking on Google Maps, and just another angle makes it look like maybe not nose-in spots, but parallel spots might, one or two might fit there.

1021
01:27:01,402 --> 01:27:04,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I guess I'm wondering, are we really losing spots?

1022
01:27:05,992 --> 01:27:12,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the thing is, is it's been used for garbage disposal and pick up for so long.

1023
01:27:13,518 --> 01:27:19,583
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a kind of a underused section of our clipper ship lot here on that wall.

1024
01:27:23,586 --> 01:27:23,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1025
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:27,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine anybody actually ever parking there unless they lived in that building.

1026
01:27:28,627 --> 01:27:35,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this also part of the city's waste program in our effort to get things containerized?

1027
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:45,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of this request is to memorialize these, but part of it is to get Ebisuya recycling into dumpsters?

1028
01:27:46,401 --> 01:27:47,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct, yeah.

1029
01:27:47,202 --> 01:27:53,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now they have a giant pile of boxes that they put out on Riverside Avenue that waste management picks up.

1030
01:27:54,386 --> 01:27:57,569
[SPEAKER_14]: And it takes them like 15 minutes to get it into the packer truck.

1031
01:27:58,549 --> 01:28:04,833
[SPEAKER_14]: So what the recommendation is, is for a 10-yard recycling dumpster to be put somewhere.

1032
01:28:05,254 --> 01:28:07,315
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no somewhere on their private property.

1033
01:28:08,136 --> 01:28:12,339
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is what they have been using or the building owner has been using for dumpsters.

1034
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:17,675
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems to be working out okay.

1035
01:28:17,795 --> 01:28:29,484
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to see if we can either consolidate those four into, maybe there's still four, but maybe there's also recycling in there as well, because I think those are trash.

1036
01:28:30,725 --> 01:28:35,328
[SPEAKER_01]: They have residential there, although I understood the residents were moving out.

1037
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:39,171
[SPEAKER_01]: They say they ought to be having recycling as well as trash.

1038
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:51,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think to Alicia's point, it looks like it's too short to park head in like saying Alicia from what I could tell.

1039
01:28:51,901 --> 01:28:55,222
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe, I mean, it might've been built for dumpsters.

1040
01:28:55,262 --> 01:28:56,223
[SPEAKER_14]: We, I just don't know.

1041
01:28:56,243 --> 01:28:57,223
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no like history.

1042
01:28:57,263 --> 01:29:05,406
[SPEAKER_16]: We'd have to go back in time and yeah, see losing zero spaces or if it was ever spaces, maybe two parallel.

1043
01:29:06,586 --> 01:29:11,108
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if an aerial view might help, but can pull that up.

1044
01:29:13,332 --> 01:29:17,374
[SPEAKER_06]: While you pull it up, I'm just going to take time to invite the public.

1045
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:23,096
[SPEAKER_06]: If they have a comment, does anyone wish to speak to this petition for or against?

1046
01:29:23,296 --> 01:29:25,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Just raise your hand, indicate.

1047
01:29:31,919 --> 01:29:40,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, the aerial view is up and we can see the issue as described by Director Blake.

1048
01:29:41,628 --> 01:29:48,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Do other commissioners have questions or comments to Commissioner McGill?

1049
01:29:53,217 --> 01:30:00,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm in favor of getting our businesses into dumpsters and getting the trash off of our streets and the recycling off of our streets.

1050
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:07,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am aware that there are some situations where the businesses literally do not have the space to do that on their own properties.

1051
01:30:08,508 --> 01:30:09,929
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't properly designed.

1052
01:30:10,249 --> 01:30:15,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one way we can collaborate to make that happen.

1053
01:30:17,194 --> 01:30:21,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Design centers back then didn't always take into consideration solid waste removal.

1054
01:30:22,407 --> 01:30:29,593
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're ending up in, you know, not a lot, but a handful of situations where we've got to get creative for the way we do things today.

1055
01:30:31,354 --> 01:30:32,615
[SPEAKER_14]: This is one of those spots.

1056
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:44,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they don't have any property to do this, which I understand the language of the easement, and I'm happy to share with folks if folks want.

1057
01:30:46,072 --> 01:30:49,477
[SPEAKER_14]: But basically, at some point, this land was deeded to the city.

1058
01:30:49,937 --> 01:30:58,869
[SPEAKER_14]: It was part of that building lot to begin with, deeded to the city with the idea that a parking lot would be built, with the idea that clippership would be built.

1059
01:31:00,503 --> 01:31:08,467
[SPEAKER_14]: And then what the agreement said was basically, we're not gonna, you know, we can guarantee you that we're not gonna remove these access type things to your building.

1060
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:21,174
[SPEAKER_14]: So vehicular access around the building, the loading area that you saw, the operations of the buildings such as dumpsters, and this is the spot that they're in.

1061
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:26,356
[SPEAKER_14]: But like I said, it happens to be on the side of the line that is deeded public land.

1062
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:28,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

1063
01:31:29,441 --> 01:31:30,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner, do you have a motion?

1064
01:31:30,843 --> 01:31:32,926
[SPEAKER_01]: I would motion to approve.

1065
01:31:34,007 --> 01:31:40,696
[SPEAKER_06]: And seconded would most likely have to be Commissioner Brzezinski since it's a petition of Commissioner McGiven.

1066
01:31:41,597 --> 01:31:41,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded.

1067
01:31:42,919 --> 01:31:44,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

1068
01:31:44,441 --> 01:31:46,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Alba, can we get a roll call vote, please?

1069
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:47,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGiven?

1070
01:31:47,953 --> 01:31:48,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1071
01:31:48,873 --> 01:31:49,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

1072
01:31:50,074 --> 01:31:50,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1073
01:31:51,034 --> 01:31:52,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1074
01:31:52,555 --> 01:31:52,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1075
01:31:53,415 --> 01:31:54,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Buckley?

1076
01:31:54,135 --> 01:31:54,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1077
01:31:54,415 --> 01:31:59,037
[SPEAKER_06]: On the vote of four to nothing, the petition is approved.

1078
01:31:59,057 --> 01:32:01,538
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-18, no parking any time.

1079
01:32:01,878 --> 01:32:02,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

1080
01:32:02,898 --> 01:32:16,943
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may, I'll offer to bump my item back because I see Mr. Hartman and then Lisa Crossman have been waiting patiently, number 20 and number 59, but I can't make a motion because I'm not a member.

1081
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:30,275
[SPEAKER_06]: If a commissioner will agree with Director Blake, I will move to... Happy to move this to the end to take the patiently waiting people first.

1082
01:32:30,335 --> 01:32:31,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Will do.

1083
01:32:31,076 --> 01:32:36,058
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-20 permit parking variance, Mr. Ryan Hartman, 72 Sharon Street.

1084
01:32:36,138 --> 01:32:42,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Hartman, could you unmute yourself and present your petition?

1085
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the Traffic Commission.

1086
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:45,302
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for your patience.

1087
01:32:46,779 --> 01:32:48,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, can you hear me?

1088
01:32:48,921 --> 01:32:50,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we can hear you.

1089
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:52,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your time as well.

1090
01:32:53,845 --> 01:33:01,671
[SPEAKER_13]: It's similar to the motion before mine where I have a commercial vehicle that I park on my street that I'm trying to get permission to park on.

1091
01:33:02,412 --> 01:33:04,754
[SPEAKER_13]: I have accumulated multiple tickets for it.

1092
01:33:05,214 --> 01:33:08,817
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a vehicle I use for work every day.

1093
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:13,381
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not have a driveway at my location.

1094
01:33:15,253 --> 01:33:17,894
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm unable to park it off the street anywhere.

1095
01:33:19,255 --> 01:33:23,877
[SPEAKER_13]: The other alternative I know of is the Walgreens parking lot down the street from me.

1096
01:33:24,517 --> 01:33:29,340
[SPEAKER_13]: That costs some money to pay for, I think it's like $19 for five days or something.

1097
01:33:31,821 --> 01:33:35,703
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just trying to avoid continuously paying either parking tickets or parking for my vehicle.

1098
01:33:36,563 --> 01:33:40,145
[SPEAKER_13]: As much as I don't even like having the thing, I do need it for work.

1099
01:33:51,997 --> 01:33:55,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I confirm that you have a Nissan van?

1100
01:33:55,639 --> 01:34:00,181
[SPEAKER_06]: It has commercial plates and it's registered out of New Hampshire?

1101
01:34:00,702 --> 01:34:01,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1102
01:34:04,604 --> 01:34:09,446
[SPEAKER_06]: To the commission, we dealt with this issue earlier.

1103
01:34:09,626 --> 01:34:17,791
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd just like to point out for folks that one minor difference from the last one is Sharon Street does not appear to be resident permit for whatever that's worth.

1104
01:34:18,711 --> 01:34:20,512
[SPEAKER_16]: But it still has to negate the other issues, I guess.

1105
01:34:22,078 --> 01:34:26,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we're in a tough spot for things like this.

1106
01:34:26,482 --> 01:34:29,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, they seem to be growing a number.

1107
01:34:31,607 --> 01:34:33,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I don't want to keep tabling them, so.

1108
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:41,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we should talk to the City Council about whether we want to change the ordinance.

1109
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:44,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to understand how other communities handle this.

1110
01:34:45,903 --> 01:34:48,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something I should go have an intern look into?

1111
01:34:48,325 --> 01:34:49,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this thing Sarah knows about?

1112
01:34:51,248 --> 01:34:58,115
[SPEAKER_01]: But my instinct here is that we need to deny this, but we ought to keep a list of who these people are.

1113
01:34:58,255 --> 01:35:02,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we change the rules, we should let them know that the rules have changed.

1114
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I understood.

1115
01:35:04,161 --> 01:35:06,143
[SPEAKER_06]: You said a couple of things that intrigue me.

1116
01:35:06,523 --> 01:35:07,885
[SPEAKER_06]: One, the first one is the answer.

1117
01:35:07,925 --> 01:35:08,986
[SPEAKER_06]: We do keep track of these.

1118
01:35:11,722 --> 01:35:13,822
[SPEAKER_06]: to reach out and contact with these petitioners.

1119
01:35:15,683 --> 01:35:19,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, I do think we have to start doing some research on this matter.

1120
01:35:19,184 --> 01:35:29,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you did have an intern, I, as chair, would love the opportunity to see what they could do to kind of research what other cities and towns are dealing with this.

1121
01:35:29,666 --> 01:35:35,667
[SPEAKER_06]: This problem is, or this matter is not going away, and they seem to think it's only gonna grow.

1122
01:35:39,167 --> 01:35:41,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the numbers of petitions are going to be growing.

1123
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:42,831
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an ordinance.

1124
01:35:42,871 --> 01:35:48,717
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't really act well beyond that ordinance, barring, I guess, unusual circumstances.

1125
01:35:51,574 --> 01:36:02,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Mister Hartman, if you understand what's happening, you were here earlier, I believe you've already indicated that you were and you saw that there's an ordinance that prevents commercial vehicles.

1126
01:36:02,984 --> 01:36:05,927
[SPEAKER_06]: It limits what we can do here as a traffic commission.

1127
01:36:07,468 --> 01:36:16,937
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's enough of these petitions cropping up that we are gonna start doing some research to see what we can do to help you out in the future.

1128
01:36:19,093 --> 01:36:25,517
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to add anything to that, I'll allow that now at this time, and then I'm going to go back to the commissioners to take a vote.

1129
01:36:25,597 --> 01:36:31,401
[SPEAKER_06]: So the floor is yours if you want to add to this and throw anything out for us.

1130
01:36:38,285 --> 01:36:39,866
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to unmute.

1131
01:36:39,886 --> 01:36:40,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

1132
01:36:41,027 --> 01:36:42,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send that.

1133
01:36:43,449 --> 01:36:46,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of, I think, what's helpful for us to understand is like,

1134
01:36:47,662 --> 01:36:54,766
[SPEAKER_01]: how did you end up living in a place with no parking or where you're not allowed to park the vehicle overnight, but you live here?

1135
01:36:54,786 --> 01:36:57,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you had a driveway, that would be the solution.

1136
01:36:58,988 --> 01:36:59,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it would be.

1137
01:37:01,089 --> 01:37:09,713
[SPEAKER_13]: I initially lived, I lived in Medford for a few years now, and I used to be able to park in at the end of my street, because for some reason it was allowed at the end of that street.

1138
01:37:10,153 --> 01:37:13,035
[SPEAKER_13]: That is now four or five blocks from my house.

1139
01:37:15,253 --> 01:37:18,397
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't particularly want to walk a 20-minute, 30-minute walk every day.

1140
01:37:20,299 --> 01:37:24,444
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more likely that we were enforcing the rules differently at the time, honestly.

1141
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:30,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine that there's any place in Medford where the rules are different, unless it was a private way?

1142
01:37:30,932 --> 01:37:33,254
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it was a main street.

1143
01:37:33,294 --> 01:37:35,137
[SPEAKER_13]: I just never seemed to have any issues there.

1144
01:37:36,938 --> 01:37:39,820
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure, maybe it was just different, but I never had a problem over there.

1145
01:37:40,481 --> 01:37:43,283
[SPEAKER_13]: But now that I've moved, I do have a different issue, which is the car.

1146
01:37:43,683 --> 01:37:49,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a smaller vehicle than my last one, but it is still a commercial vehicle that I use for work.

1147
01:37:52,389 --> 01:37:54,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood, and thank you.

1148
01:37:54,491 --> 01:38:02,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioners, I present the petition back to you for resolution.

1149
01:38:06,249 --> 01:38:10,152
[SPEAKER_14]: motion to deny.

1150
01:38:10,252 --> 01:38:17,297
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I'll say, again, I hope as our city grows, Chief, I like your idea.

1151
01:38:17,998 --> 01:38:24,062
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got to start letting the elected officials know that we're running into issues like this.

1152
01:38:26,695 --> 01:38:28,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I agree with Commissioner McGivern.

1153
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:35,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I would vote to deny it, but I do want people to understand it's something that we're looking into to hopefully fix in the future.

1154
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:36,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have to.

1155
01:38:37,659 --> 01:38:38,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, second.

1156
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:51,604
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Commissioner McGivern to deny petition 2025-20 for a parking variance to 72 Sharon Street, seconded by Commissioner Baczynski.

1157
01:38:51,724 --> 01:38:53,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Albert, roll call vote, please.

1158
01:38:53,675 --> 01:38:54,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1159
01:38:55,116 --> 01:38:55,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1160
01:38:55,956 --> 01:38:56,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

1161
01:38:57,437 --> 01:38:57,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1162
01:38:58,197 --> 01:38:59,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1163
01:38:59,878 --> 01:39:00,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1164
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:01,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief Buckley?

1165
01:39:02,259 --> 01:39:02,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1166
01:39:02,739 --> 01:39:08,401
[SPEAKER_06]: On the vote of four to zero, the petition is denied for the reasons stated above.

1167
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:22,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will add that we will start looking into this and make it known to the city council and Commissioner Hunt, I would appreciate any services you could provide by way of internship to do some research into this.

1168
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:28,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, if I could just address Alicia and the commissioners.

1169
01:39:29,044 --> 01:39:36,831
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason for this law in 2002 was because of eight taxi cabs that were parking on LSF.

1170
01:39:38,172 --> 01:39:51,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel that they were not looking at single cars, it was commercial, but yet it was a taxi company that was parking on LSF, and that was the reason for this ordinance.

1171
01:39:55,672 --> 01:40:19,278
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean another thing to consider this particular one's also an out-of-state plate so if and when the council or this commission ever considered commercial overnight perhaps there's still somehow to get them garaged in Medford it might be a compromise of some sort because those other things complicate matters and I wanted to also I don't have

1172
01:40:19,987 --> 01:40:27,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim's Commissioner on Parking Policy and Enforcement in front of me, that they may have already done some research on what other cities and towns do.

1173
01:40:27,815 --> 01:40:28,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim, do you recall?

1174
01:40:29,657 --> 01:40:30,158
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.

1175
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:39,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the research for some of the surrounding communities, and we looked at Somerville and Cambridge, I believe, in regards to their commercial vehicle.

1176
01:40:40,276 --> 01:40:56,409
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, I think as Todd alluded to, the out-of-state plate issue with the Chapter 90 chief or something of that regard, in regards to if somebody lives in this community, it's an out-of-state plate, how is that handled in regards to the Chapter 90?

1177
01:40:56,489 --> 01:41:04,175
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some other issue that might be in addition to just an ordinance that is in place in this regard.

1178
01:41:05,675 --> 01:41:18,466
[SPEAKER_06]: understood and I think it's high time we do a little bit trying to do some research and investigate this come to some terms with we've been doing a lot of work on parking in the city we'll put the effort into this one also.

1179
01:41:21,703 --> 01:41:33,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on the request of Commissioner Hunt, 2021-59 has been, last month we removed it from table items placed on this agenda.

1180
01:41:33,094 --> 01:41:38,338
[SPEAKER_06]: 2021-59, handicapped signs, West Bedford Community Center, Arlington Street.

1181
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:46,246
[SPEAKER_06]: In September of 22, there was a request for two handicapped signs for the West Bedford Community Center.

1182
01:41:46,626 --> 01:41:54,032
[SPEAKER_06]: the traffic commission approved one sign and we set up a review for six months for an additional side.

1183
01:41:54,092 --> 01:41:59,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Well we will be on those six months and we've untabled it for discussion.

1184
01:42:01,057 --> 01:42:04,040
[SPEAKER_06]: The petitioner was present earlier.

1185
01:42:06,241 --> 01:42:06,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1186
01:42:06,502 --> 01:42:08,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Crossman is still available.

1187
01:42:08,123 --> 01:42:09,524
[SPEAKER_06]: We will ask you to unmute.

1188
01:42:10,785 --> 01:42:15,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that she has shared some emails and discussions with Director Blake

1189
01:42:20,150 --> 01:42:21,451
[SPEAKER_16]: as well as Francis.

1190
01:42:22,091 --> 01:42:23,231
[SPEAKER_06]: And Francis also.

1191
01:42:23,251 --> 01:42:25,272
[SPEAKER_06]: So Ms.

1192
01:42:25,292 --> 01:42:37,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Crossman, if you'd like to present the petition again, we understand that it was sent here for originally 2022, and then I will move to both Todd and Francis on this matter.

1193
01:42:38,018 --> 01:42:39,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the Traffic Commission.

1194
01:42:39,858 --> 01:42:40,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1195
01:42:41,539 --> 01:42:46,301
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are requesting that we move forward with the second space.

1196
01:42:47,582 --> 01:42:48,182
[SPEAKER_00]: We have

1197
01:42:49,335 --> 01:42:54,499
[SPEAKER_00]: The ride that comes to deliver folks to our activities.

1198
01:42:54,579 --> 01:43:03,985
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes the ride is dropping off in the space and another person with the placard is pulling up to park.

1199
01:43:05,727 --> 01:43:14,433
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several folks that have the placard and are in need of it as people age or they have a fall or different issues.

1200
01:43:15,513 --> 01:43:18,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd like to have access

1201
01:43:20,276 --> 01:43:21,957
[SPEAKER_00]: from the street to the door.

1202
01:43:21,977 --> 01:43:29,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we think it's time.

1203
01:43:30,119 --> 01:43:32,819
[SPEAKER_00]: We have plenty of folks that would utilize the space.

1204
01:43:33,559 --> 01:43:44,402
[SPEAKER_00]: We're challenged with folks who misuse the space and don't have a placard but are parking in the wrong direction, or they're a delivery driver and they're dropping off.

1205
01:43:45,642 --> 01:43:46,002
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.

1206
01:43:46,062 --> 01:43:53,009
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would just like to secure those two spaces for the folks that need the access.

1207
01:43:53,609 --> 01:44:01,316
[SPEAKER_00]: As we do more events, as we do more activities, that space becomes more in need.

1208
01:44:01,336 --> 01:44:03,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

1209
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:06,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you have my concern as well.

1210
01:44:08,093 --> 01:44:14,788
[SPEAKER_06]: that since we have instituted the one, there is still a need or an overwhelming need for an additional one.

1211
01:44:15,329 --> 01:44:17,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to let you speak to that, but I think you already have.

1212
01:44:18,205 --> 01:44:26,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely, because the first time around it was requested, I was first coming on to the organization, and that was post-pandemic.

1213
01:44:26,768 --> 01:44:28,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything, it was so dead at the center.

1214
01:44:29,009 --> 01:44:30,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was really happening.

1215
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:32,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was in motion.

1216
01:44:33,031 --> 01:44:38,733
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, flash forward three years later, we're doing events all the time, activities.

1217
01:44:39,153 --> 01:44:42,074
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a more diverse group coming through the door.

1218
01:44:42,835 --> 01:44:45,996
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with the city health department in doing

1219
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:50,585
[SPEAKER_00]: different health awareness activities and that's drawing different folks.

1220
01:44:50,825 --> 01:44:56,550
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we do more rentals and things like that, we have more people who need that access.

1221
01:44:57,210 --> 01:44:59,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yes, we've ramped up since then.

1222
01:45:00,713 --> 01:45:08,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, if I may, I just wanted to point out that the second one would still be within the, not that it has to be, but it would still be within the frontage of the community center.

1223
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:12,002
[SPEAKER_16]: So it wouldn't be impacting in front of anyone else's house nearby.

1224
01:45:12,022 --> 01:45:13,764
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd also like to point out that

1225
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:18,884
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't sometimes the question comes up, but there are other handicaps spaces in the area.

1226
01:45:18,924 --> 01:45:19,804
[SPEAKER_16]: Would there be too many?

1227
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:23,207
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't appear that there's any in the general vicinity besides this.

1228
01:45:23,267 --> 01:45:25,889
[SPEAKER_16]: So, it doesn't seem like it would be too many for the 1 area.

1229
01:45:25,909 --> 01:45:29,912
[SPEAKER_16]: And obviously, they'd be available for use by any of the.

1230
01:45:30,693 --> 01:45:35,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Residents in the area, especially during non community center hours for someone to park overnight that may need it as well.

1231
01:45:37,659 --> 01:45:38,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably go right here.

1232
01:45:41,053 --> 01:45:42,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Director Blake.

1233
01:45:42,754 --> 01:45:47,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Director Nwaje is also present.

1234
01:45:47,436 --> 01:45:49,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to speak on the matter?

1235
01:45:50,737 --> 01:45:54,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so, please unmute yourself and welcome to the Traffic Commission.

1236
01:45:59,206 --> 01:46:00,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

1237
01:46:00,307 --> 01:46:04,809
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just here to advocate for the second space to be put up as quickly as possible.

1238
01:46:05,489 --> 01:46:19,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that one of the things that we sometimes don't always understand is that one party may be making a request, but that request is actually a benefit to an entire community.

1239
01:46:19,577 --> 01:46:27,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I do stop by the community center on a regular basis and I observe and I notice

1240
01:46:28,401 --> 01:46:31,104
[SPEAKER_09]: the demographics in that neighborhood.

1241
01:46:31,264 --> 01:46:37,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily all attending the community center per se, but just in that neighborhood.

1242
01:46:38,229 --> 01:46:47,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I see those two spaces as a benefit to people who might need them and who would already qualify for them, which is not our jurisdiction.

1243
01:46:47,817 --> 01:46:49,939
[SPEAKER_09]: They would already have received that placard.

1244
01:46:50,559 --> 01:46:54,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I see those spaces as a benefit to helping people aged in place.

1245
01:46:56,083 --> 01:47:07,487
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I look at it on a much broader level, a little saddened that 1 was given and it was come back for the 2nd 1, but I wasn't here for that.

1246
01:47:07,547 --> 01:47:08,867
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can't speak to that.

1247
01:47:08,987 --> 01:47:12,088
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I would like to see this move forward as quickly as possible.

1248
01:47:17,543 --> 01:47:20,504
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, participation, Director Nwaje.

1249
01:47:20,584 --> 01:47:32,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioners, before I go to the public to see their input, do we have questions or concerns of either the current petitioner, Director Blake or Director Nwaje?

1250
01:47:36,728 --> 01:47:42,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had one point that what we approved going on three years now, it was basically

1251
01:47:43,418 --> 01:47:45,485
[SPEAKER_03]: To review, it's not like we denied it, right?

1252
01:47:45,505 --> 01:47:48,815
[SPEAKER_03]: We just wanted to give them one and then see if they needed another one, correct?

1253
01:47:50,277 --> 01:47:58,482
[SPEAKER_09]: The wording from what I saw stated, you could have one, and it was basically evaluate and see if you need the other one.

1254
01:47:58,602 --> 01:48:04,046
[SPEAKER_09]: So when it comes to accessibility, there really is no evaluation.

1255
01:48:04,566 --> 01:48:10,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Just by way of the person coming forward, that person is already presenting that they have a need.

1256
01:48:10,590 --> 01:48:16,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Because how would you evaluate if you were not the one that has the needs?

1257
01:48:16,214 --> 01:48:17,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see what I'm saying?

1258
01:48:18,535 --> 01:48:38,287
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we continue to have more people aging and aging that attend the community center, but people in that community that resides there that are aging, I feel like it's really time to either say we're gonna put the second space or say we're not able to put the second space.

1259
01:48:40,038 --> 01:48:41,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your comment.

1260
01:48:41,459 --> 01:48:46,722
[SPEAKER_03]: The point I just wanted to make, I think we were evaluating whether that was the proper space for you.

1261
01:48:46,762 --> 01:48:50,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's anybody on the group who would deny it.

1262
01:48:50,924 --> 01:48:53,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just basically, was there a better option for you?

1263
01:48:53,465 --> 01:49:00,489
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the other handicapped spot is the better option, barring anything from the public or from my fellow commissioners, I would go ahead and approve this.

1264
01:49:00,849 --> 01:49:03,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that was the point I was trying to make.

1265
01:49:04,631 --> 01:49:06,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Commissioner Wisniewski.

1266
01:49:07,807 --> 01:49:08,728
[SPEAKER_06]: to approve 2021-59.

1267
01:49:08,788 --> 01:49:13,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Handicap sign a second handicap sign for the West

1268
01:49:36,188 --> 01:49:37,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1269
01:49:37,709 --> 01:49:37,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1270
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:39,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

1271
01:49:39,611 --> 01:49:39,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1272
01:49:40,632 --> 01:49:41,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1273
01:49:41,813 --> 01:49:49,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1274
01:49:52,963 --> 01:49:53,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Unmute.

1275
01:49:53,784 --> 01:49:54,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sorry.

1276
01:49:55,797 --> 01:49:56,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your time.

1277
01:50:19,166 --> 01:50:20,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1278
01:50:20,186 --> 01:50:27,352
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025-18, no parking anytime south side of Fulton Spring Road from Fulton Street, a distance of 50 feet east of Fulton Street.

1279
01:50:27,773 --> 01:50:31,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Sergeant Rogers, Director Blake, who would like the floor first?

1280
01:50:35,887 --> 01:50:36,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Sergeant.

1281
01:50:36,628 --> 01:50:48,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, we've received complaints in that this area that the school buses cannot make the turn off of Fulton onto Fulton Spring Road because of parents parking on the other side.

1282
01:50:49,438 --> 01:50:51,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I take it waiting for their children.

1283
01:50:52,961 --> 01:51:01,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I also went up on off school hours and residents of Fulton Street in this area where there is no parking on Fulton Street

1284
01:51:02,972 --> 01:51:04,493
[SPEAKER_05]: are parking in the same area.

1285
01:51:05,133 --> 01:51:08,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't believe it's a school hour issue.

1286
01:51:08,554 --> 01:51:10,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's a 24-7 hour issue.

1287
01:51:10,034 --> 01:51:18,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Tara and I have come up with a plan where there'd be no parking on the south side of Fulton St.

1288
01:51:18,938 --> 01:51:21,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Road from Fulton St.

1289
01:51:21,959 --> 01:51:22,199
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 feet.

1290
01:51:24,119 --> 01:51:24,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

1291
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And Director Blake, I see you put that up.

1292
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:31,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you just kind of explain to the commissioners

1293
01:51:34,347 --> 01:51:36,088
[SPEAKER_06]: plan visually on your map?

1294
01:51:36,688 --> 01:51:41,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the thought is that 20 feet just doesn't cut it at this particular intersection.

1295
01:51:42,171 --> 01:51:55,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Fulton Spring Road is kind of tight for parking on both sides and two-way traffic, but we want to be sensitive to parking elsewhere, and it's really just the throat at the intersection that appears to be the problem, not further down the block.

1296
01:51:56,379 --> 01:52:01,542
[SPEAKER_16]: So we wanted to start with one side, 50 feet, and see if that

1297
01:52:02,215 --> 01:52:08,717
[SPEAKER_16]: rectifies any issues clogging up this area, particularly during the schools, but during all times.

1298
01:52:09,197 --> 01:52:15,740
[SPEAKER_16]: And then if this didn't remedy the situation, we'd come back and potentially modify it at a later date.

1299
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:18,020
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is what we came up with at this time.

1300
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:19,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

1301
01:52:19,981 --> 01:52:20,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1302
01:52:21,042 --> 01:52:24,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioners, questions of Sergeant Rogers and Director Blake?

1303
01:52:27,364 --> 01:52:28,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ask my standard question.

1304
01:52:28,844 --> 01:52:30,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we notified the abutting owners?

1305
01:52:33,348 --> 01:52:35,189
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have to.

1306
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:37,150
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have to.

1307
01:52:37,170 --> 01:52:40,872
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a good question.

1308
01:52:41,332 --> 01:52:50,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Just so the residents in this area or some of the parents in this area that are aware of the issue, the ones who contacted us, not necessarily the direct abutters.

1309
01:52:51,017 --> 01:52:56,179
[SPEAKER_06]: There are really no houses here.

1310
01:52:56,599 --> 01:52:57,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Blake, let me ask a question.

1311
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,642
[SPEAKER_06]: The two corner houses there, are they residents of Fulton Spring or Fulton Street?

1312
01:53:02,632 --> 01:53:09,418
[SPEAKER_16]: This one here looks like Fulton, and they do have a driveway up the page here, right here, this driveway.

1313
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:20,566
[SPEAKER_16]: And this house does appear to be a resident of Fulton Spring, but they also appear to have two current residents.

1314
01:53:20,586 --> 01:53:29,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and to both you and the sergeant, to answer Commissioner Brzezinski's question, the neighbors of those residents at a minimum haven't been notified on this.

1315
01:53:30,887 --> 01:53:34,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe they need to be.

1316
01:53:34,988 --> 01:53:36,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I support all these safety changes.

1317
01:53:36,968 --> 01:53:43,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think as a courtesy, we should do a better job of notifying the people that are affected by this.

1318
01:53:43,429 --> 01:53:44,870
[SPEAKER_03]: If nothing else, tell them we're doing it.

1319
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:45,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a safety issue.

1320
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:46,870
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope you'll understand.

1321
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:51,311
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just don't like our habit as a city of not notifying people of things.

1322
01:53:51,431 --> 01:53:51,831
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

1323
01:53:53,031 --> 01:53:53,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

1324
01:53:53,571 --> 01:53:58,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt, Commissioner McGiven, questions, comments?

1325
01:53:59,137 --> 01:53:59,997
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad we're doing this.

1326
01:54:00,778 --> 01:54:14,585
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of like on my radar as far as fixing this issue because I used to live up here and it's not just school buses, it's landscaping trucks, it's a garbage truck every now and then.

1327
01:54:16,451 --> 01:54:17,632
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think this is a good first step.

1328
01:54:18,273 --> 01:54:22,698
[SPEAKER_14]: I was even thinking, you know, expanding it and making it parking just on one side.

1329
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:28,285
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think this is a good incremental step to see if this solves some of the issues up there.

1330
01:54:28,365 --> 01:54:29,206
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm in favor of it.

1331
01:54:29,226 --> 01:54:33,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems like a reasonable safety thing to me.

1332
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:37,631
[SPEAKER_06]: go to the public.

1333
01:54:37,691 --> 01:54:38,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who's left here.

1334
01:54:39,253 --> 01:54:42,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone in the public wish to speak for or against this petition?

1335
01:54:42,637 --> 01:54:45,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even see who we have left here.

1336
01:54:45,641 --> 01:54:47,423
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just Mr. Viola hanging out.

1337
01:54:47,443 --> 01:54:52,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Viola's riveted by our actions here.

1338
01:54:54,105 --> 01:55:00,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, seeing none from the public, I send it back to the commissioners for a vote.

1339
01:55:01,191 --> 01:55:16,945
[SPEAKER_06]: From the chair, I would suggest that however this petition falls out, I would recommend that my sergeant, traffic sergeant and director Blake, do some outreach to the naval with regard, whether it passes or doesn't pass in this.

1340
01:55:19,658 --> 01:55:48,295
[SPEAKER_06]: to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve 
the motion

1341
01:55:49,458 --> 01:55:50,658
[SPEAKER_06]: unless I got those all wrong.

1342
01:55:50,778 --> 01:55:51,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Alva, vote, roll call vote.

1343
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:53,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1344
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:54,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1345
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:55,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

1346
01:55:56,641 --> 01:55:56,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1347
01:55:57,541 --> 01:55:58,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1348
01:55:59,181 --> 01:55:59,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1349
01:56:00,522 --> 01:56:01,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Buckley?

1350
01:56:01,482 --> 01:56:01,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1351
01:56:01,822 --> 01:56:05,023
[SPEAKER_06]: On the vote of Ford and Upton, the petition has been approved.

1352
01:56:06,344 --> 01:56:10,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Skipping ahead, 2025-21, crosswalk daylighting.

1353
01:56:10,945 --> 01:56:13,166
[SPEAKER_06]: First one, High Street opposite Boynton Road.

1354
01:56:13,246 --> 01:56:15,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Second one, High Street opposite Potterhouse Road.

1355
01:56:15,447 --> 01:56:18,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Blake, the petition and floor are yours.

1356
01:56:24,761 --> 01:56:26,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I'm just trying to pull up a graphic here.

1357
01:56:27,122 --> 01:56:37,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief, if you'd like to remind the commissioners that we had a child hit at this location two weeks ago.

1358
01:56:39,027 --> 01:56:44,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, luckily it was no injury, but it just highlights the fact that we need to circle back.

1359
01:56:44,769 --> 01:56:47,670
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been doing it kind of piecemeal, and this one's near a school.

1360
01:56:48,397 --> 01:56:52,338
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're trying to restrict parking ahead of a crosswalk.

1361
01:56:53,258 --> 01:57:00,260
[SPEAKER_16]: So prior to a crosswalk coming from Winthrop Circle towards Medford Square, this is in the vicinity of the school.

1362
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:03,961
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's next to the gymnasium there opposite Boynton Road.

1363
01:57:04,261 --> 01:57:05,681
[SPEAKER_16]: This is probably a better view.

1364
01:57:05,701 --> 01:57:10,262
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a crosswalk here right at the end of the gymnasium.

1365
01:57:10,722 --> 01:57:14,463
[SPEAKER_16]: When people park right up to this crosswalk, it really impacts the sightline.

1366
01:57:15,969 --> 01:57:17,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so we want restricted.

1367
01:57:18,650 --> 01:57:24,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Tim will appreciate this to this existing pool here and swap out the sign with different science and no new pool.

1368
01:57:25,914 --> 01:57:31,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and then we have hatched it, although it was raining that day.

1369
01:57:31,336 --> 01:57:37,339
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll see if it lasts, but the paint and we've had put cones there as well to try to really highlight that.

1370
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:43,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, DPW graciously also installed led flashing signs already.

1371
01:57:44,234 --> 01:57:47,776
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're just trying to do our best to improve these crosswalks wherever we can.

1372
01:57:47,796 --> 01:57:51,739
[SPEAKER_16]: And the second one that's listed on the same item is also near St.

1373
01:57:51,779 --> 01:57:54,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Joseph's School on High Street, opposite Powder House.

1374
01:57:54,701 --> 01:57:55,781
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Powder House here.

1375
01:57:55,801 --> 01:58:00,204
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a driveway before the crosswalk, but we need a little more than that.

1376
01:58:01,005 --> 01:58:05,227
[SPEAKER_16]: And that will be on an existing pole, so not a new channel either, a light pole.

1377
01:58:06,328 --> 01:58:07,389
[SPEAKER_16]: So this light pole here.

1378
01:58:07,409 --> 01:58:10,971
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's about a half a parking space and then a driveway.

1379
01:58:12,447 --> 01:58:12,728
[SPEAKER_16]: What's that?

1380
01:58:13,448 --> 01:58:13,989
[SPEAKER_16]: You're on a roll.

1381
01:58:14,489 --> 01:58:15,910
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's cool.

1382
01:58:17,411 --> 01:58:21,674
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the request, daylight, these two crosswalks.

1383
01:58:24,015 --> 01:58:31,100
[SPEAKER_16]: The other direction, there's a street on Boynton and there's a bus stop already, so it's really only the eastbound direction that we're looking for.

1384
01:58:35,448 --> 01:58:36,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Director Blake.

1385
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:41,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioners, questions or concerns related to the petition?

1386
01:58:47,216 --> 01:58:52,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question about the striping of the crosswalks.

1387
01:58:52,279 --> 01:58:54,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that will happen automatically?

1388
01:58:55,241 --> 01:58:56,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we waiting for something?

1389
01:58:57,182 --> 01:59:00,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know if the picture is accurate today, but they look faded.

1390
01:59:03,794 --> 01:59:08,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, when the weather turns in the spring, we usually do a round of paint.

1391
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:16,343
[SPEAKER_16]: So whatever is faded now, it just won't, temperature and wet weather, rain or snow, it just won't adhere.

1392
01:59:16,423 --> 01:59:20,666
[SPEAKER_16]: So we usually try to do it spring, summer, fall.

1393
01:59:21,747 --> 01:59:23,689
[SPEAKER_16]: This one in particular looks very faded, yes.

1394
01:59:24,729 --> 01:59:32,075
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have, if you drive out there, I have other photos where the LED signs really make the crosswalk pop up too.

1395
01:59:34,197 --> 01:59:35,238
[SPEAKER_14]: They were quick.

1396
01:59:35,438 --> 01:59:40,343
[SPEAKER_14]: So those ones, I think, we do once a year, the ones on High Street.

1397
01:59:42,465 --> 01:59:44,467
[SPEAKER_14]: So the answer is yes, they automatically get done.

1398
01:59:45,488 --> 01:59:45,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1399
01:59:46,208 --> 01:59:48,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one last question, how many parking spots are being lost?

1400
01:59:49,892 --> 01:59:50,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Any?

1401
01:59:51,153 --> 01:59:58,380
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like one and a half at the Boynton location and then a half of space at opposite parts.

1402
02:00:00,977 --> 02:00:03,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And just for the record, I'll ask my standard question.

1403
02:00:03,318 --> 02:00:05,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we notify the abutting homeowners of what we're doing?

1404
02:00:05,898 --> 02:00:22,863
[SPEAKER_16]: In this particular case, we did not notify this apartment building with a half space, but the school is aware because the folks running some of those programs, the young girl was walking towards a basketball practice.

1405
02:00:22,964 --> 02:00:27,805
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was the parents of the school as well as some of the administration of the school that asked for it.

1406
02:00:28,706 --> 02:00:28,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1407
02:00:29,366 --> 02:00:32,788
[SPEAKER_16]: So it would really impact them the most, that one-and-a-half space.

1408
02:00:34,129 --> 02:00:35,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in that area.

1409
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:42,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I live on Grandview, and that's a poorly lit area, particularly at night, and the kids just dart all over the place.

1410
02:00:44,235 --> 02:00:53,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, to reiterate my point on the last, I encourage us to continue to notify the people affected by this, but the safety issues, I'm all for it.

1411
02:00:53,801 --> 02:00:57,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're done with discussion, I'd be happy to put a motion forward.

1412
02:00:58,418 --> 02:01:03,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Steve, your point about the lighting too, we did check all the street lights.

1413
02:01:06,244 --> 02:01:12,068
[SPEAKER_16]: We checked the street lights in the area to see if they were working properly and at the highest illumination, so that was a good point, Steve.

1414
02:01:13,950 --> 02:01:15,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Hunt, comments and questions?

1415
02:01:16,772 --> 02:01:19,234
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it seems like a safety thing to me, so.

1416
02:01:19,254 --> 02:01:23,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me go to the public, since we still do have a number.

1417
02:01:23,537 --> 02:01:26,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone in the public wish to speak for or against the petition?

1418
02:01:30,484 --> 02:01:35,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, I send it back to the commissioners for a resolution.

1419
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:46,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioner Brzezinski was about to make a motion, but delayed.

1420
02:01:48,408 --> 02:01:51,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Presuming no other comments from the other commissioners, motion to approve.

1421
02:01:52,208 --> 02:01:55,489
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Commissioner Brzezinski.

1422
02:01:56,029 --> 02:01:59,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And one point of clarification on both, if we need to approve both.

1423
02:02:00,865 --> 02:02:01,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

1424
02:02:01,405 --> 02:02:11,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Commissioner Brzezinski to approve 2025-21 crosswalk daylight for both one High Street opposite Point Road and two High Street opposite Potterhouse Road.

1425
02:02:12,448 --> 02:02:13,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by?

1426
02:02:13,228 --> 02:02:15,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Black History Month.

1427
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:18,610
[SPEAKER_10]: The first is by Andrea Campbell.

1428
02:02:18,690 --> 02:02:20,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Commissioner McGibbon.

1429
02:02:21,491 --> 02:02:22,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Alva, roll call roll.

1430
02:02:23,011 --> 02:02:23,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1431
02:02:24,531 --> 02:02:25,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1432
02:02:25,312 --> 02:02:26,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

1433
02:02:26,632 --> 02:02:26,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1434
02:02:27,532 --> 02:02:28,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1435
02:02:29,373 --> 02:02:29,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1436
02:02:30,416 --> 02:02:31,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Buckley.

1437
02:02:31,177 --> 02:02:34,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, on the vote of 4-0, the petition is approved.

1438
02:02:36,902 --> 02:02:37,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1439
02:02:37,442 --> 02:02:43,688
[SPEAKER_16]: The Mayor and Councilor Scarpelli had requested that we do something in that regard, so it will be appreciated.

1440
02:02:43,708 --> 02:02:43,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1441
02:02:44,948 --> 02:02:46,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Director Blake.

1442
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:52,510
[SPEAKER_06]: To the two final items, I'm making sure I didn't miss anything with the jumping rocks.

1443
02:02:52,590 --> 02:02:58,551
[SPEAKER_06]: The two final items on the business tonight were our tabled items that we brought forth to the agenda.

1444
02:02:58,731 --> 02:03:05,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I will start with 2023-47, no left turn, Emerson Street to Main Street.

1445
02:03:06,193 --> 02:03:12,295
[SPEAKER_06]: This was voted on February 13th, 2024th meeting for a three-month review.

1446
02:03:14,128 --> 02:03:16,770
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you unaware, Director Blake, if you could pull this up.

1447
02:03:18,932 --> 02:03:29,340
[SPEAKER_06]: My guess is that as a result of a lot of the work that we've done at the South Street, Main and South Street intersection, Emerson Street became a larger cutthroat and we were seeing an increase of traffic accidents.

1448
02:03:30,941 --> 02:03:35,184
[SPEAKER_06]: The Traffic Commission had put up a no left turn and put some barriers across there.

1449
02:03:35,685 --> 02:03:41,049
[SPEAKER_06]: And to this point, I think we've seen a high success rate of very few, if not

1450
02:03:41,693 --> 02:03:44,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we have one accident, I think, someone, the research did since this time?

1451
02:03:44,934 --> 02:03:45,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Sargent.

1452
02:03:47,175 --> 02:03:48,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was one.

1453
02:03:51,576 --> 02:03:53,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were several that were.

1454
02:03:53,696 --> 02:03:56,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Before the change, there were several, right?

1455
02:03:56,837 --> 02:03:57,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1456
02:03:58,558 --> 02:03:58,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, one.

1457
02:03:59,258 --> 02:04:02,619
[SPEAKER_06]: So this petition is brought forth for the three-month review.

1458
02:04:09,310 --> 02:04:20,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if any of the commissioners have questions of either Sergeant Rogers, Director Boyko, or myself as to how it has been working out.

1459
02:04:22,398 --> 02:04:25,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a question about is this is what we've put up?

1460
02:04:26,501 --> 02:04:32,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's supposed to be a redesign of this area long term, but are we going to leave in place these pylons?

1461
02:04:33,185 --> 02:04:35,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the end result?

1462
02:04:35,966 --> 02:04:36,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to extend the

1463
02:04:38,264 --> 02:04:42,047
[SPEAKER_03]: The curve in the middle or the whatever that is, the flower bed.

1464
02:04:43,068 --> 02:05:00,745
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't discussed it with Tim, but I would suggest we leave these in place until the mass DOT long-term plan comes into place, because then we wouldn't spend city money to do something that we know is coming up by a different entity.

1465
02:05:00,785 --> 02:05:01,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Discussed.

1466
02:05:01,505 --> 02:05:01,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

1467
02:05:04,362 --> 02:05:05,003
[SPEAKER_03]: have a motion to approve.

1468
02:05:05,023 --> 02:05:06,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just more of a point of clarification.

1469
02:05:06,844 --> 02:05:08,925
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, no other comments from my colleagues.

1470
02:05:09,025 --> 02:05:10,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I motion to approve.

1471
02:05:10,126 --> 02:05:15,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay Uh, the most of Commissioner Brzezinski to approve 2023-47.

1472
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:22,615
[SPEAKER_06]: No left turn ever the street to Main Street after it's three months for fuel to make permanent.

1473
02:05:23,075 --> 02:05:24,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second by the

1474
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:32,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner McGiven?

1475
02:05:32,791 --> 02:05:33,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1476
02:05:34,371 --> 02:05:35,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Hunt?

1477
02:05:35,132 --> 02:05:36,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1478
02:05:36,733 --> 02:05:37,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1479
02:05:38,434 --> 02:05:38,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1480
02:05:39,434 --> 02:05:40,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief Buckley?

1481
02:05:40,235 --> 02:05:43,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, on a vote of four nothing, the petition is approved.

1482
02:05:44,077 --> 02:05:49,640
[SPEAKER_06]: In the same fashion, we have 2024-37, the G-Zone only six-month pilot review.

1483
02:05:50,501 --> 02:05:55,544
[SPEAKER_06]: This Traffic Commission has voted in the G-Zones six months ago.

1484
02:05:55,664 --> 02:05:58,465
[SPEAKER_06]: It is set for review in the January 2020 fifth meeting.

1485
02:05:58,525 --> 02:06:00,487
[SPEAKER_06]: We have now put it to the February meeting.

1486
02:06:02,329 --> 02:06:04,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I will start by reporting back.

1487
02:06:04,690 --> 02:06:06,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I think part of the pilot approval was the response

1488
02:06:19,214 --> 02:06:24,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsequent to the pilot beginning, there have been two reports of issues.

1489
02:06:25,459 --> 02:06:32,444
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them was regarding the two-day and four-day pass program in the G zone and an explanation of that.

1490
02:06:33,425 --> 02:06:43,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And the additional one was a Dexter Street resident who was concerned because they had been receiving tickets because of the 48 hours they were

1491
02:06:45,277 --> 02:06:49,580
[SPEAKER_02]: going beyond the 48-hour process, they happen to be in the G Zone.

1492
02:06:50,181 --> 02:06:52,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them have subsequently been responded to.

1493
02:06:54,303 --> 02:07:02,189
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the traffic at Medford Police Department, there have been zero reports of the G Zone, according to Sergeant Canava.

1494
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:10,215
[SPEAKER_02]: The parking department also has had zero reports of any issue with the G-Zone.

1495
02:07:11,336 --> 02:07:16,459
[SPEAKER_02]: We had set up a C-click fix for G-Zone reporting or issues.

1496
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,441
[SPEAKER_02]: There is zero there as well.

1497
02:07:19,422 --> 02:07:26,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a very limited amount of feedback that we had, and most of it had been clarification.

1498
02:07:27,563 --> 02:07:39,385
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, I have submitted to you all some of the numbers for the LPR visits and ticketing over a six-month process for our focus streets.

1499
02:07:40,726 --> 02:07:43,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a little bit of a addition to that.

1500
02:07:44,346 --> 02:07:53,568
[SPEAKER_02]: The LPR technology is just used by the parking department and not the police department to rules that they have in place moved out to privacy, et cetera.

1501
02:07:54,442 --> 02:08:01,688
[SPEAKER_02]: So the numbers that we have is, for the LPRs, over 2,000 visits to the G Zone itself and 749 tickets written by the LPR technology.

1502
02:08:01,748 --> 02:08:03,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsequent to that, we seem to have additional

1503
02:08:15,030 --> 02:08:21,499
[SPEAKER_02]: tickets that were issued on Alfred Street, a total of 37, Bow Street, a total of 317, Neal Street, 354, Marion Street, 108, Stanley, 93,

1504
02:08:33,436 --> 02:08:37,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Birgit Av, 94, and Stearns, 25.

1505
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:50,071
[SPEAKER_02]: So over a six-month period, the enforcement has been there, either in the LPR technology, also the foot patrol, more managing them differently.

1506
02:08:50,372 --> 02:08:51,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the number of visits.

1507
02:08:51,933 --> 02:08:58,319
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not part of writing the tickets, but we can assume that that visit number grows dramatically.

1508
02:08:59,607 --> 02:09:01,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good point.

1509
02:09:01,229 --> 02:09:01,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1510
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:02,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1511
02:09:12,233 --> 02:09:21,017
[SPEAKER_02]: push out the parking problem versus variances are limited to that specific street and encumbers people who live on that street.

1512
02:09:21,498 --> 02:09:25,380
[SPEAKER_02]: This sort of gives a little bit of equity for folks.

1513
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:28,101
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not telling people to park on one location.

1514
02:09:28,161 --> 02:09:32,863
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually giving them an option to park on multiple locations in an area.

1515
02:09:33,824 --> 02:09:35,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So the feedback has been

1516
02:09:36,870 --> 02:09:39,731
[SPEAKER_02]: positive from conversation, from reporting.

1517
02:09:40,031 --> 02:09:47,853
[SPEAKER_02]: People just generally do not report good issues with the mayor's office or parking, et cetera.

1518
02:09:48,333 --> 02:09:57,375
[SPEAKER_02]: But from just conversations informally with people, it seems to be something that folks are a little bit happy about going forward.

1519
02:09:57,775 --> 02:10:04,677
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, because of the G zone, some of our main streets, Boston Avenue, Winchester Street, Harvard Street,

1520
02:10:05,541 --> 02:10:14,528
[SPEAKER_02]: and also have become resident parking streets helping folks in those communities, in those areas.

1521
02:10:14,548 --> 02:10:14,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

1522
02:10:14,909 --> 02:10:16,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that presentation.

1523
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:18,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Commissioners, questions of Mr. Silva?

1524
02:10:27,899 --> 02:10:30,081
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's working the way it should be.

1525
02:10:34,333 --> 02:10:35,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your presentation.

1526
02:10:36,174 --> 02:10:39,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm probably the one who asked for the six-month review or pushed it.

1527
02:10:39,177 --> 02:10:43,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the information and I appreciate your presentation.

1528
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:43,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1529
02:11:01,870 --> 02:11:07,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry I'm seeing no public participation.

1530
02:11:07,552 --> 02:11:09,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Director McDermott the floor is yours.

1531
02:11:10,513 --> 02:11:26,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to be clear going forward I am I a member of the public in these meetings or that's why I always wait for that that the request for the public because I know I'm not on the Commission so I feel like that's my role here but anybody else wants to talk first that's fine.

1532
02:11:27,518 --> 02:11:29,419
[SPEAKER_06]: You are like

1533
02:11:36,979 --> 02:11:40,525
[SPEAKER_06]: that we need to depend on to address some of our issues.

1534
02:11:40,605 --> 02:11:44,070
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have anything, you can either wave or interject.

1535
02:11:44,971 --> 02:11:46,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Blake will show you how to do that.

1536
02:11:49,478 --> 02:11:56,081
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the chair missed asking you first before the public sometimes.

1537
02:11:56,341 --> 02:11:56,841
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.

1538
02:11:58,042 --> 02:12:05,185
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really just a recent thing that we noticed that is a benefit of the zoned parking.

1539
02:12:05,345 --> 02:12:16,570
[SPEAKER_08]: I met with Owen in engineering about, and we talked about this a little bit earlier in the parking implementation team meeting, about when

1540
02:12:17,590 --> 02:12:30,507
[SPEAKER_08]: engineering issues an on-street permit for construction and that street is permitted, then the residents of that street are displaced and communicating where they can then park.

1541
02:12:30,648 --> 02:12:31,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they're parked on

1542
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:48,621
[SPEAKER_08]: If they usually park on one street and a big chunk of that street is given away for construction to occur, then the communication to the public as to where they should then park is not always clear, and it's hard to communicate to them.

1543
02:12:49,321 --> 02:12:54,205
[SPEAKER_08]: In a zoned parking situation, that negates that issue.

1544
02:12:54,585 --> 02:13:06,493
[SPEAKER_08]: If somebody in the G-Zone, Winchester Street, a big chunk of it, a few blocks is taken up with construction, then they can park anywhere else in the G-Zone and it's not going to get them a ticket.

1545
02:13:06,973 --> 02:13:14,859
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have to worry about giving them or you have to park on this street because then inevitably somebody is going to say, I don't want that street, I want this street.

1546
02:13:16,695 --> 02:13:29,388
[SPEAKER_08]: The zone parking negates that issue for the most part and makes displacing people from one street a lot less of a burden on the citizen.

1547
02:13:43,944 --> 02:13:44,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I have nothing more.

1548
02:13:44,665 --> 02:13:46,866
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, Jim, thank you for the presentations.

1549
02:13:48,407 --> 02:13:49,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that it's working out.

1550
02:13:53,429 --> 02:14:01,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have lots of residents who live on these streets who are complaining and telling us that it's horrible and they wish we would take it away?

1551
02:14:01,213 --> 02:14:05,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for the police department.

1552
02:14:05,255 --> 02:14:05,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1553
02:14:06,876 --> 02:14:07,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for the mayor's office.

1554
02:14:08,774 --> 02:14:16,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And those residents, and they may not know we're discussing it tonight, but they knew that we said it was a pilot and we would evaluate.

1555
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:18,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, we've taken a long time for it.

1556
02:14:18,841 --> 02:14:22,985
[SPEAKER_01]: We've given them extra time to tell us if there were problems.

1557
02:14:23,005 --> 02:14:26,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good.

1558
02:14:26,787 --> 02:14:30,810
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to take a vote.

1559
02:14:31,171 --> 02:14:32,512
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.

1560
02:14:32,812 --> 02:14:34,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Move to approve it as permanent.

1561
02:14:35,143 --> 02:14:46,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Commissioner Hunt to approve 2024-37 to make the G-Zone program a permanent part of the city of Medford parking practice.

1562
02:14:47,087 --> 02:14:53,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Commissioner Hunt, seconded by... The letter that was written by... Commissioner McGiven?

1563
02:14:53,869 --> 02:14:54,289
Yup.

1564
02:14:54,689 --> 02:14:57,010
[SPEAKER_06]: You're fading, but we're almost done.

1565
02:14:57,310 --> 02:14:58,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Alba, roll call, please.

1566
02:14:58,870 --> 02:14:59,871

[SPEAKER_10]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1571
02:15:08,677 --> 02:15:08,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1572
02:15:08,957 --> 02:15:09,037

1573
02:15:09,057 --> 02:15:09,317

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1585
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:14,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1586
02:15:29,793 --> 02:15:34,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to state that we got through three more table items moving forward.

1587
02:15:36,557 --> 02:15:39,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to have maybe Sgt.

[SPEAKER_06]: Canava take a look at any of these other table items that we could present for you.

1590
02:15:55,539 --> 02:15:57,060
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to get through it.

1591
02:15:57,860 --> 02:16:07,525
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I will accept a motion to adjourn, and I thank you all, as usual, for your participation and your assistance in this matter.

1592
02:16:08,225 --> 02:16:10,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion.

1593
02:16:10,606 --> 02:16:12,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Blake, did you have a comment?

1594
02:16:12,427 --> 02:16:14,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Vail, is that what you were waiting for all this time?

1595
02:16:15,329 --> 02:16:16,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Just make sure.

1596
02:16:18,350 --> 02:16:20,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he can't unmute himself here.

1597
02:16:20,131 --> 02:16:21,352
[SPEAKER_01]: He's friendly.

1598
02:16:22,262 --> 02:16:31,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to hear a little bit more about the zone parking and I think it's been working wonderfully to be honest with you.

1599
02:16:31,608 --> 02:16:33,770
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and let me say, it's another thing.

1600
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:37,192
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great to have the parking clerk attending the meetings too.

1601
02:16:37,252 --> 02:16:39,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's going to be a benefit for everybody.

1602
02:16:39,934 --> 02:16:40,034
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

1603
02:16:40,574 --> 02:16:43,235

02:16:58,443 --> 02:16:59,884
[SPEAKER_06]: It's late.

1614
02:16:59,984 --> 02:17:00,644
