1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,012
Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:03,354
Welcome to the City of Medford Traffic Commission meeting.

3
00:00:03,394 --> 00:00:10,739
Today is Tuesday, February 11, 2025, and the time is 5.07 p.m.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,941
The meeting will now come to order.

5
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:14,882
Alba, could we get a roll call of the commissioners?

6
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:16,844
Commissioner McGibbon?

7
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:18,705
Present.

8
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:20,266
Commissioner Hunt?

9
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:21,727
Here.

10
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:23,529
Commissioner Brzezinski?

11
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:24,627
I'm here.

12
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,728
Chief Buckley?

13
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,550
Present, with four commissioners present.

14
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,490
We have a quorum.

15
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:33,573
Also present this evening is Secretary to the Traffic Commission, Alva Erickson.

16
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:39,136
I have Medford Police Traffic Sergeant Larry Rogers, Director of Traffic and Engineering.

17
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:43,219
Todd Blake is present online, as well as Jim Silver here.

18
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:44,360
He has special projects.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,163
Coordinator for the City of Medford, Jim Silver, and Director of Parking, Sarah McDermott.

20
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:49,663
Todd Blake?

21
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,304
I said Todd, didn't I?

22
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:51,544
Okay.

23
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:52,685
Okay, sorry.

24
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:53,946
Alva's looking out for you, Todd.

25
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:07,656
The minutes of the January traffic commission meetings have been forwarded to all commissioners.

26
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:18,244
If the commissioners have seen them and have read them and have anything they want to discuss, otherwise we'll take a vote to approve the minutes.

27
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:26,906
Motion to approve.

28
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:33,610
On the motion of Commissioner McGiven to approve the January 2025 Traffic Commission meetings.

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,370
Do I have a second?

30
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:39,374
Seconded.

31
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:41,475
Seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

32
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,096
Alma, roll call, please.

33
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:44,357
Commissioner McGiven.

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:45,580
Yes.

35
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:46,721
Commissioner Hunt?

36
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:47,301
Yes.

37
00:01:47,782 --> 00:01:48,963
Commissioner Brzezinski?

38
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:49,503
Yes.

39
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:50,764
Chief Buckley?

40
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:51,344
Yes.

41
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:57,869
On the vote of four to nothing, the minutes of the January 25th Traffic Commission meeting have been accepted into the records.

42
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,611
New business 2025-11.

43
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:04,915
Sean Hill of 14 Winthrop Street.

44
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:07,777
Request for visitor passes for Tesla Avenue.

45
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:11,599
Parking is restricted on this portion of Winthrop Street for the Commissioner's

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,243
as remember is Mr. Hill present and could we ask you to unmute yourself?

47
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:22,085
I'm not so sure we have many other people here present to participate.

48
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:37,093
Chief, I don't see anybody by that name or raising their hand or indicating that they are a petitioner.

49
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:44,534
Neither do I. And for Albert, he was notified and indicated that he would attend.

50
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:45,696
He has been notified.

51
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:49,181
I have been in conversation with him via telephone.

52
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:53,166
He has had these business passes in previous years.

53
00:02:54,522 --> 00:03:00,190
but he wasn't given them for renewal in 2025, that's why he has petitioned for them.

54
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,796
And there's no parking on Winthrop Street, so he's between a rock and a hard place.

55
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:09,742
Okay, and do you know if in the past he has petitioned this traffic commission for those passes?

56
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:12,193
because it's not normal.

57
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,935
And for the record, I'll speak to the public and to the commissioners.

58
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:18,377
Winthrop Street, there's no parking on Winthrop Street.

59
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:27,104
And when your legal residential address is not on a permanent parking street, but your property sits on the corner of a permanent parking street, which is this case,

60
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:34,547
then the owner is entitled to automatically receive a permit for the resident permit parking street.

61
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:37,489
However, they are not allowed to have visitor passes.

62
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,191
Some members of the public do petition the traffic commission for visitor passes.

63
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:48,013
And do we know, Albert, if he has petitioned this commission in the past?

64
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:51,235
Because he has indicated to us that he's received them in the past.

65
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:54,166
I'm not sure on that.

66
00:03:54,646 --> 00:04:11,290
In some instances where there is no parking on the main street Wentworth, they've given corner homes visitor passes, but maybe with the G zone, it might have a reflection on that and he had to petition.

67
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:14,191
So he did come forward and petition for this year.

68
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:15,392
Okay, thank you.

69
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:24,759
If the commissioners have followed that, I will take some guidance if you have questions or suggestions on this petition without the petitioner present.

70
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:44,811
I was searching our database and I'm not finding this in particular.

71
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:48,270
May I speak, Chief Bursak?

72
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,316
I looked at the variance list and his name is there, but it does not say visitor passes.

73
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,698
So it is on Tesla.

74
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:59,741
He's on Winthrop Street, but it says parking on Tesla.

75
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:05,427
But it doesn't have anything in the notes that states specifically visitor passes.

76
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,040
Jim, is there a historical record there that would indicate maybe last year or the year before?

77
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:19,222
It's a carry through, it's a carry over from the list that was given originally two years ago when we implemented this process.

78
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:25,024
So I think Alvin might have asked me that question and I did say his name was listed there.

79
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,106
Unfortunately, the notes are not there.

80
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:39,813
I went back and looked through the history as much as I possibly could through the minutes from the parking meetings over the years, and I could not find that specific ruling.

81
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,715
It doesn't give me the date when it was approved.

82
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:44,115
Excellent.

83
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:44,576
Thank you, John.

84
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:52,378
Jim, I felt the need to be able to replicate what you do, given your conversation earlier today.

85
00:05:52,398 --> 00:06:02,588
And I went to the file, the TC regulations complete, and would I be looking on the one that's labeled schedule F parking variances?

86
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:03,168
Correct.

87
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:04,149
So you're going to look at that.

88
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,430
And then I don't see it.

89
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:10,595
If you look at F, if you go to the top of the page, you'll see the street listing.

90
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:17,087
on the left side of this, so it's the street that they are parking on, not the street of their residence.

91
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,928
So if it's Tesla, it would be Tesla.

92
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,810
There's two entries for Tesla.

93
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,272
Yeah, I did see that.

94
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,292
Now I'm trying to find that.

95
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:30,435
I'm trying to do a search on the page, but I can scroll down to Tesla.

96
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:31,195
Yeah.

97
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,177
And I saw the two

98
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:47,389
This one references the parallel street that says those folks can park on Tesla, and then it has 22 Winthrop, I believe, is the address.

99
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,490
Alvin, is that correct?

100
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:48,490
14.

101
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:54,355
I think I'm having trouble loading it.

102
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:55,856
I think that's part of my trouble.

103
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:58,298
I'm going to go off the Wi-Fi first.

104
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:07,298
So I just measured from 14 winter.

105
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:16,204
If all those streets are resident permit, the visitors could park on Boston Ave, which is about 880 feet away, which is about a three and a half minute walk.

106
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:18,446
If that helps the discussion.

107
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:26,972
And I don't really understand why we give permits, but not visitor permits like.

108
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:34,677
On the other hand, I do like people to come and tell us what their situation is.

109
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,546
I find that to be extremely helpful.

110
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:51,239
During the search, we also noted that there was resident parking on Winthrop Street, and there is a legacy sign by the former Sacred Heart Church location.

111
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,200
It's not inconceivable that at one point, resident parking was there.

112
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,501
It's just that we are petitioning to take that sign down.

113
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:04,923
Obviously, there's no parking on that segment of Winthrop Street anymore, but a sign does exist.

114
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,644
guess is that's extremely awful when the church was there.

115
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:34,182
Well we could deny the petition based on the Traffic Commission rule related to resident permit parking variances for corner residential homes and in light of the petitioner not being present, the

116
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:50,854
petitioner could always request it again in the future, moving forward, but I will leave that to the commissioners to make a decision on what to write.

117
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:52,535
Can I ask a quick question?

118
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,616
Yes, sir.

119
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:59,301
I mean, is this something we would consider granting if they could complete their case?

120
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:01,843
If so, can we table it?

121
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:03,783
a month?

122
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:07,866
We can table anything and we have considered this in the past.

123
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:11,028
And I can't tell you what level we allow.

124
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:17,632
I believe, like Commissioner Hunt has indicated, we'd like to hear their story and their cases to what we granted.

125
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:19,413
So it is possible in tabling.

126
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:22,575
It is a resolution to this.

127
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:31,494
I mean, I'd support getting rid of it, but as a courtesy, I'd support tabling it just to give them another month to come talk.

128
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:34,154
Okay, so we have a motion to table.

129
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:35,694
That's Commissioner Brzezinski.

130
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:36,535
Do I have a second?

131
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:45,536
I'll second that.

132
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:48,437
Seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

133
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:51,698
Alba, roll call, please.

134
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:53,218
Commissioner McGiven.

135
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:54,471
No.

136
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,254
Commissioner Hunt?

137
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:58,475
Yes.

138
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:00,596
Commissioner Brzezinski?

139
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:01,277
Yes.

140
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:02,498
Chief Buckley?

141
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:03,759
Yes.

142
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,262
On the vote of three to one to zero, the motion is approved.

143
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:08,943
Table 2025-11.

144
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:10,585
I'll vote.

145
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:16,049
We'll reach out to that petitioner and see what's going on.

146
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:16,349
Yes.

147
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:18,991
2025-12, perfect parking variance for Harvard Street.

148
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:21,333
From Christopher Miller, 379 Main Street.

149
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:35,372
The petitioner has indicated he has had a variance for permits in 2023 and 2024, but has been denied for 2025 citing changes to the policy with the adoption of the GLXR.

150
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:39,833
Is the petitioner, Mr. Miller, present, and could we ask them to unmute?

151
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:46,635
So there is somebody raising his hand, a viola, why don't I, I'll ask him to unmute.

152
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:47,895
Sounds good.

153
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:53,788
Beautiful, thank you very much.

154
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,513
My name is Tony Viola and good evening everybody.

155
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:05,280
I just got a call from a landlord at 379 Main Street in Medford where Mr. Miller lives.

156
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,661
He's a second floor tenant.

157
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:10,285
I just got a call from him a few minutes ago, suggesting that he couldn't

158
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:14,507
make the meeting this evening, and he asked if I would stand in for him.

159
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:23,033
I'm not sure what the protocol would be with respect to the traffic commission, and if you'd like to table this for another month, that would be perfectly fine.

160
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:28,556
It seems reasonably straightforward in light of especially what the chief has just said.

161
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:34,060
But if it's something that needs to be tabled, please, I would love you to consider that as well.

162
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,063
But I'd be happy to sit in and explain some of the situation to you.

163
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:42,950
Well, thank you for being present, Mr. Viola, we understand.

164
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,032
Generally, the petition should be presented by the petitioner.

165
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:53,758
However, we have historic rules from the Traffic Commission related to residential homes and apartments on corners.

166
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,903
We have recently made Harvard Street a resident-private parking street based on the GLX zone.

167
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:08,130
There's been some offline discussion I've had with Jim Silver, et cetera, but the point is,

168
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:15,935
Based on the rule, this petitioner would be allowed a variance to park on Harvard Street.

169
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:22,439
and it would be automatic and it could be granted just for the parking department.

170
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,380
It does not need traffic commission approval.

171
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:34,545
The difference this year would be that this individual with that variance would be given a GLX zone parking permit, which will allow them to park anywhere within the zone.

172
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:43,370
And so I just wanted the commissioners to understand that that the new zone, there's an impact on the rule as it relates to the new GLX zone.

173
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:48,493
Thoughts on this or would you like to wait for the petitioner?

174
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:56,368
I mean, I'd be interested to hear sort of what the issue is, if Mr. Viola can explain it to us.

175
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:12,944
I recognize that Main Street is not a street that residents can park on, and this person has clearly been used to parking on Harvard Street, and they must be in the section that hasn't allowed parking recently, so he's been having to park up the street.

176
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:19,380
Right, isn't this right near the corner is where we actually said it's not wide enough to park.

177
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,482
And so we've been enforcing the no parking there.

178
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:29,968
Yeah, this section measures the part that's no parking, which is next to that building, like I said.

179
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:35,132
Can you see that?

180
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:38,954
I feel that since Mr. Viola made the effort to come, we can at least hear what he has to say.

181
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:43,558
And then we can figure out if we can decide or if we need to table it or deny it or approve it or whatever.

182
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,537
Okay, fair enough.

183
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:52,583
Any other commissioners have a thoughts on Mr Viola presenting on behalf of the petitioner and or the rule itself?

184
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:54,024
I'm okay with it.

185
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:55,485
Yeah, I agree.

186
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:59,990
Okay, I will turn it back to the petitioner's representative.

187
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:07,657
Mr Viola, can you just speak briefly on the reason that your tenant is, should you know, or is a need in

188
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:12,100
perhaps discuss the issue of parking around the apartment building?

189
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:26,950
Just very quickly, Chief, for the record, Mr. Miller discovered recently that he had a parking permit that was issued for Harvard Street back on August 25th of 2023.

190
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:33,494
We have the permit number if you need me to tell it to you.

191
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:40,776
He was on the impression that the permit was valid for one year from 8-25-23 to 8-25-24.

192
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:47,957
And then when he went into the parking clerk's office was denied the ability to renew the permit.

193
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:51,458
And I think it probably expired back in 12-31-23 to start with.

194
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:08,700
So now he's been parking on Main Street, and the walk is a little bit longer, obviously, to get to Main Street areas where he can park that isn't restricted by time, especially during daytime.

195
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:21,888
He's been a tenant again since 2023 and had the benefit of a parking pass to park on Harvard Street, and he would like to have that renewed if possible.

196
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:34,976
Am I under the impression that the parking variance should be automatic or is it by vote of the Traffic Commission when you have a corner lot?

197
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:43,354
that is a corner lot in a GLX zone or in a corner lot on a resident permit parking street?

198
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:54,224
Yep, so by rule, the rule of the traffic commission, given that this is a corner residential property where the

199
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:04,364
And in this case, Main Street is not a resident permit parking, but we have just made Harvard Street a permit parking over the past several, for this past summer.

200
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:12,330
So it allows your tenant to automatically receive a permit, resident permit parking for Harvard.

201
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:16,073
So by rule, you are correct in understanding that.

202
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:21,177
Historically, Harvard was not a permit parking street until we made the GLX also.

203
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:28,964
So does that render this the meeting that we're having now about the variance move or is it something that we would want to do?

204
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:31,067
That is my next question of the commissioners.

205
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:40,416
Should they agree that this is a moot point for the traffic commission and or parking director McDermott is present also if they have a thought or concern.

206
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:41,707
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:41,947
Yeah.

208
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,409
May I speak to this, please?

209
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:48,771
So the variance that this resident is seeking.

210
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:51,653
Would kind of set the.

211
00:16:52,414 --> 00:17:00,298
Kind of set a precedent for the rest of the G L X zone and any future zones that might be created.

212
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,800
So the I believe the reason the

213
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:14,647
If they get Harvard Street as a variance, that's lumped into the G zone, which means they could park anywhere with that variance.

214
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:27,215
They could park on Wareham, Marion, all those streets in that zone, Yale Street, and that hasn't been approved, which is why it was originally denied by the clerks.

215
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:33,258
I believe that's why the resident or the landlord was sent to the traffic commission to seek this variance.

216
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:43,551
in granting this variance, it might set the stage for any other corner variances that would lead to a variance in the G zone.

217
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:48,792
Excellent.

218
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:55,293
It's a valid description of the impact of the commission.

219
00:17:55,313 --> 00:18:03,875
So the commissioners, do we have any concerns with upholding our, well, do we have any concerns with upholding the rule as it stands?

220
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:05,723
Right.

221
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:14,069
And I don't think that the corner variance rule had been contemplated with the idea of zoned parking.

222
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:25,636
It would give him permission rather than just on the street throughout the whole zone, which is like a huge level of parking other than that had not been contemplated.

223
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:26,637
Yep.

224
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:27,818
More space.

225
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:39,988
Here, it is possible to walk down the street down to Main Street, like three blocks, I think, two blocks in either direction, two to three, and get parking.

226
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:42,909
On Harvard, he's actually going to have to walk up.

227
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:49,953
It's not literally a block, but it's the same distance up Harvard Street to where parking is allowed.

228
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:58,109
It's not like he could just park next to his house on the side street.

229
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,690
That's all factors.

230
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:16,972
I guess if this was a street where Main Street had no options, I might feel like we've just taken away all his parking by creating the zone.

231
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:21,993
In this case, we haven't, but it could be somewhere else in the zone.

232
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,722
So, Commissioner, I think it almost is irrelevant what street we give it on.

233
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:33,163
He's had Hobbit in the past.

234
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:35,924
I don't think there's a concern over granting Hobbit.

235
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:49,810
I mean, if we granted Wareham, which we've done in the past, if we've granted Marion, which we've done in the past, the question still remained, that would entitle the owner of that variance to park anywhere within the GLX zone.

236
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,832
Now, I think by rule, I'm fine with that.

237
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:56,133
The question is that the rest of the commission is fine with that.

238
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,862
I'm okay with that, because we're just carrying through status quo.

239
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:05,084
Because you're a corner lot, you kind of have frontage on a G zone street anyway.

240
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:09,726
Commissioner Buzzynski?

241
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:11,266
Yeah, I agree.

242
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:19,309
I mean, I'd like to implement the plan that we have versus, you know, granting a variance.

243
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:23,231
Commissioner Hunt, any?

244
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,232
I'm okay with it if the others are.

245
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:37,076
If the commissioners will allow, can I ask Jim Silva to weigh in on this, because he was the planner behind the GLX on.

246
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,297
Jim, comments and your thoughts on this?

247
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:40,137
Certainly.

248
00:20:40,977 --> 00:20:46,319
I think this probably is the best case scenario to grant to any of those streets.

249
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:47,259
The reality is,

250
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:55,485
If we keep granting to Harvard Street when it wasn't a zone, we don't even know how many parking spaces exist.

251
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:58,587
So we're granting all of this opportunity to park in one location.

252
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:03,191
But the zone parking perspective, now you're spreading it out dramatically.

253
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:07,554
So when people need a place to park, they're no longer relegated to one location.

254
00:21:07,954 --> 00:21:12,418
They're actually able to park anywhere in the area, in the proximity to their home.

255
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:13,899
So to your point,

256
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:23,145
I think we were waiting for the G zone to become a reality from its temporary situation to a reality of a permanency.

257
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:28,928
But that said, this is sort of a precedent for those corner homes going forward.

258
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:32,531
So we're not overwhelming one street, we're actually spreading it out.

259
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:35,232
Excellent.

260
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:42,277
And Director McDermott, any issues from the parking director perspective of maintaining the same rule?

261
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:54,666
No, Jim Silva and I have discussed this briefly and I'm on board with granting this and similar variances in zoned parking in the future.

262
00:21:54,686 --> 00:22:00,311
Yeah, I think I think it makes sense that we were, we didn't have a solution for this because we weren't sure of the permanency of the G zone.

263
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:03,794
So, I believe that's on the agenda tonight.

264
00:22:03,894 --> 00:22:04,955
So, I guess, maybe we'll.

265
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:10,121
we'll see what happens but for now I have no objections to granting this variance.

266
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:14,748
Okay and no concerns if Mr. Miller shows up in the next couple of days to get his variance?

267
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:15,570
No.

268
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,010
Okay.

269
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,457
Mr. Viola, having heard from the commissioners,

270
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:35,531
I can state that this is not a matter for this traffic commission this evening and the rule of the traffic commission that would allow your tenant to receive a resident permit parking is still in existence.

271
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:47,482
I would, if you have any questions, I would accept on behalf of the petitioner, a withdrawal of the petition with the understanding that he's eligible to get this without traffic commission approval.

272
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:50,004
And I'm sure he'd be very happy with that, no question.

273
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:52,266
So yeah, no further questions.

274
00:22:53,146 --> 00:22:54,628
I think it's a nice resolve.

275
00:22:55,208 --> 00:23:14,084
And just from a landlord's perspective, it's so much easier to be able to tell a tenant, a prospective tenant that a permit is available to you rather than needing prior to site execution of a lease to come and appear before the traffic commission to obtain a variance for the parking.

276
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:25,452
Especially when I back and did some research and I think I found 10 variances that were approved for corner lots over the past year and a half or so.

277
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:26,273
But when the 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

278
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:37,480
that was coming in for a corner lot was approved kind of in a, you know, after some discussion.

279
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,183
But it will save you guys, I think, a lot more time and effort and energy that could be directed in other areas.

280
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:45,104
And so, thank you so much.

281
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:46,825
That would be wonderful if we could get this voted.

282
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:55,863
I do appreciate your time and your presentation, first of all, and thank you on behalf of your petitioner.

283
00:23:55,883 --> 00:24:05,386
2025-13, permit parking variance for Honeywell Ave from Rafael Zarzenak Gomes, 305 Riverside Ave, Apartment 4.

284
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:08,427
Is Mr. Gomes present and could you unmute?

285
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:14,668
He is here.

286
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,869
He mentioned in the chat that he doesn't speak

287
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:18,738
Was that Rafael?

288
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:19,698
Yeah.

289
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:21,639
Okay, I'm asking him to unmute now.

290
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:44,228
Hello?

291
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:46,528
Hello, Mr. Gomes?

292
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:47,629
Yes.

293
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:49,990
Hi, welcome to the Traffic Commission.

294
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,630
You have a petition before us.

295
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:55,892
I think you're trying to find the chat message.

296
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:02,155
You indicated through the chat that you do not speak English very well.

297
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:05,276
What language do you speak primarily?

298
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:12,239
Oh, he muted himself.

299
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,040
There, I sent it again.

300
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,050
Hello?

301
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:32,552
Hello, Mr. Gomes, how are you?

302
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,592
I'm good.

303
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:34,073
Welcome.

304
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:40,796
Yeah, sorry, I tried to speak, but I think he was moved.

305
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:44,958
I was leaving Summerville, I moved to Medford right now.

306
00:25:45,498 --> 00:25:45,798
Yep.

307
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:46,538
Stop.

308
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:56,023
But I need to park my car, I'd like to park my car in this street, because I'm parked so far.

309
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:57,583
It's possible.

310
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,604
I have a permit to park there.

311
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:03,025
Okay, so you live at 305 Riverside Ave.

312
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:05,486
That's an apartment building off of that.

313
00:26:05,806 --> 00:26:08,767
Did they provide you with a parking spot?

314
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:21,772
Oh, he keeps pushing the mute button.

315
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:25,053
I hope nobody else is hitting his mute button.

316
00:26:27,782 --> 00:26:28,983
I sent him another email.

317
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:31,624
All right.

318
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,165
In apartment, there is just one spot.

319
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:37,266
All right.

320
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:41,468
So you have one spot provided to you by the owner of the property.

321
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:44,029
And so you have two vehicles?

322
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,170
I can't buy.

323
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,972
Another person is using this spot.

324
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,673
I don't have a spot to put my car.

325
00:26:55,957 --> 00:26:57,758
Another person you reside with?

326
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:01,599
Sorry?

327
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:05,740
Is it someone you live with or somebody they did not provide?

328
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,020
Yes.

329
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,180
Yes.

330
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,600
OK.

331
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,941
The apartment, there are two rooms.

332
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:13,742
The people are using this spot.

333
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:17,043
I don't have a spot in the building, you know?

334
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,243
I need to park it so far.

335
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:22,004
I need to walk about five minutes every day.

336
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:23,244
It's so hard for me.

337
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:25,025
Can I ask where you are?

338
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:28,866
Sorry, can I ask where you are parking?

339
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:34,468
I'm parking, let me check in the maps, one second.

340
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:45,630
Some days I park in Spring Street, some days I park in Bradshaw Street.

341
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:50,851
Okay, hang on tight for one second.

342
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:53,112
But for me, I saw plates,

343
00:27:54,636 --> 00:28:05,217
i came parking i i don't know how can i say this is a honey hill avenue right yes yes is it possible i park there

344
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,001
Okay, so we'll debate that right now.

345
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,261
If you can hang tight, we may have some further questions.

346
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:29,284
So commissioners, the petitioner is requesting, because there's multiple people in his apartment, a variance for his vehicle to park on Honeywell Ave because there's no place for him to park on 305 Riverside Ave.

347
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:32,565
Do we have questions of the petitioner or concerns?

348
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,411
I have a question.

349
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:45,792
Commissioner McGiven.

350
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,394
Yes, go ahead.

351
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:54,478
Did you realize, I guess, when you rented this place that there was only one space and that it wasn't available to you?

352
00:28:54,498 --> 00:29:03,064
I can ask again.

353
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:05,045
He keeps muting himself.

354
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,667
Please leave yourself unmuted if you can.

355
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:10,309
Yeah, I don't know what is happening.

356
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:11,710
Sorry, can you repeat, please?

357
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:13,077
That's okay.

358
00:29:13,238 --> 00:29:19,622
I just wanted to know if you knew when you were renting this apartment that it did not have a parking space for you.

359
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:28,509
Yes, I knew about it before, but she told me I can't park in 100 Hill Avenue.

360
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:30,150
I asked her.

361
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:38,736
She told me I can't park in this street, but I'm living one month and I'm parking on the street.

362
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:39,977
For me, it's so bad.

363
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:41,358
I don't know what I can do.

364
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:54,336
Thank you.

365
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,141
Chief, may I speak on

366
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:14,683
for the parking permitting process.

367
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:22,168
They, I believe, arrived from Somerville and assumed that our parking program was similar to Somerville's.

368
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:25,951
And I think that was sort of the misconception.

369
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:37,219
We did have an opportunity to speak on the way that we work, the parameters here, and coming to the Traffic Commission, hence he's here this evening.

370
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:43,560
and sort of the variance rules and what is needed to actually, if it is approved to get that permitting.

371
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:51,742
So again, I think during that initial rental period, it was sort of understood that resident parking was available.

372
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:56,183
Thank you for that explanation, Joe.

373
00:30:58,543 --> 00:31:05,445
And in Somerville, it's anybody who lives in Somerville can get a permit to park anywhere in Somerville, correct?

374
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:09,337
That's surprising, you would think they'd be stricter than that.

375
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,302
Have we given permits before?

376
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:31,068
I know we've done it for other buildings on Riverside Ave in general, we've given permits for some of the cross streets, but there's not a lot of permit parking in this area.

377
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:37,788
That's correct, we have in the past given some in that area.

378
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:42,829
It's not unheard of that we would award a variance for certain areas.

379
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:46,470
The same question comes up every single time that we do this.

380
00:31:48,010 --> 00:32:01,413
How do we sort of stem the flow of all of these parking private, well not private, but these residential apartment buildings who provide parking but not enough park?

381
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:11,102
And what is the responsibility of the city of Medford when those apartments are on major avenues that you can't park on?

382
00:32:12,902 --> 00:32:16,483
So time old question as it relates to this.

383
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:28,485
Well, wait till they start building the actual apartments that we've permitted where we've told them as part of the condition of construction that the residents cannot get permit parking.

384
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:34,926
that's been coming through the Community Development Board, but none of those are yet occupied buildings.

385
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:51,651
Yes, and in this case, if I understand, there's at least someone who indicated to Mr. Gomes that he would be eligible to park on the side streets, but that was probably under a misconception of Somerville versus Memphis parking rules.

386
00:32:53,352 --> 00:32:53,592
Right.

387
00:32:58,863 --> 00:33:02,125
Spring Street is unrestricted, correct?

388
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:03,526
Correct.

389
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,848
I think he said that he parks there sometimes.

390
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:09,269
Yep.

391
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:25,639
I think if buildings are, you know, building off-street parking lots and, you know, and we're having a permit street-by-street process, I think we have to be careful

392
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:30,538
of granting these types of variances.

393
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:39,164
It sounds like the landlord may have given this person some poor information when he was leasing the apartment.

394
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:44,347
Yeah, Tim, I was just kind of looking at what you were looking at, see what streets are available.

395
00:33:44,427 --> 00:33:53,072
It looks like Pembroke and Bradshaw and Spring are available, but then some of the others that are a little closer are permanent.

396
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,542
It looks like there are a handful that are available and restricted.

397
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:06,227
Yeah, I just don't want to place the burden of some poor information from his landlord on to the folks who park on Honeywell and have permits there.

398
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:16,533
I'm not sure the public is willing to take on that burden when Spring Street is there available for this situation.

399
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:32,874
I think we're going to see more of this too in the future because parking doesn't get, we don't get more on-street parking.

400
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:34,394
It doesn't usually work that way.

401
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:45,937
I would find it helpful to have a map that I kept at my desk of where the permit parking is in the city, citywide.

402
00:34:45,957 --> 00:34:48,417
I don't know if Todd, if I can throw that your way.

403
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:51,058
Yeah, I just looked it up.

404
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:51,518
You got one.

405
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:53,872
I just looked at the park department website.

406
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:56,193
For some reason, we have the list on there, but not the map.

407
00:34:56,593 --> 00:34:57,834
So we're going to work on that.

408
00:34:57,854 --> 00:34:58,334
We have a map.

409
00:34:58,354 --> 00:34:59,054
I have one on my wall.

410
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:11,257
It's outdated, but I need a new one now that we have the zone, the G zone, and some other things.

411
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:15,279
Yeah, in this case, Spring Street is pretty closed.

412
00:35:15,499 --> 00:35:20,020
I mean, and it has a signalized crosswalks across the street.

413
00:35:32,854 --> 00:35:34,495
Commissioners, I leave it to you.

414
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:40,359
We have either further debate or to make a motion on this.

415
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:48,368
I have a question to clarify.

416
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:52,550
Spring Street is fine for him, correct?

417
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,292
But Hunnewell is closer?

418
00:35:57,513 --> 00:36:02,556
Yes, that's my understanding and I believe that is what the petition has indicated.

419
00:36:02,576 --> 00:36:12,381
Steve, if you were to walk all the way down Hunnewell and hit Bradshaw, you could park there too.

420
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:28,300
I feel like I come across as the bad person when it comes to this, but from the beginning, if there's a valid alternative that's reasonably approximate, I'm not big on giving up more city resources just to make it a little bit closer.

421
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,462
I still think we need to do a better job with educating these building owners.

422
00:36:36,142 --> 00:36:36,783
Enough is enough.

423
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:40,084
You need to stop lying to your tenants.

424
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:54,418
So I would support a motion to deny I feel bad doing it but you know as Tim pointed out if we approve this one I was just trying to count the parking spots in the parking lot and we're gonna get ten more people who are gonna petition.

425
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,566
Yep and there's more coming we can't grow parking spaces on a tree I mean so we got what we got.

426
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:06,884
I was just trying to see if I could check.

427
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:16,548
I thought that was an ownership building, which would result in if a unit's being rented.

428
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,069
Yeah, I just checked on Zillow.

429
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:25,392
There was a unit sold in 2023.

430
00:37:25,992 --> 00:37:32,155
It's not an issue of a landlord renting all the units, it's that an individual owner

431
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:34,338
is renting out a unit.

432
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:43,908
Yeah, in the distant future, if the pilot for G works, then presumably there could be a zone in this area at some point.

433
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:51,676
And then that could help spread the load, just like we were talking about in the future.

434
00:37:51,696 --> 00:37:53,257
Or the whole city.

435
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,741
Yeah, or that too.

436
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,192
I don't know.

437
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,334
I don't know if that's the right way to put it.

438
00:38:13,463 --> 00:38:16,785
And that listing says one deeded parking spot.

439
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:19,607
So it is a condo building with one spot.

440
00:38:20,027 --> 00:38:30,013
So whoever owns this unit said one thing to his tenants, as opposed to us being able to talk to an apartment manager for an apartment building.

441
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:37,677
I'll point out there is an MBTA bus for 134 that goes by there that helps the tenants.

442
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:43,528
Is that because you're forecasting my motion to deny, Todd?

443
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:48,170
There it is.

444
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,551
Spring Street is really close, too.

445
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:52,011
It's less than 500 feet away.

446
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:53,812
It has a safe crossing.

447
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:54,912
I know.

448
00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:56,953
Sorry, Rafael, but that's my motion.

449
00:38:59,152 --> 00:38:59,832
Commissioner McGiven?

450
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,813
Yeah, for reasons stated, yes.

451
00:39:04,015 --> 00:39:15,583
On the motion of Commissioner McGiven, seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski to deny the petition for a variance for Honeywell Ave.

452
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,024
I'll have a roll call vote, please.

453
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:18,165
Commissioner McGiven?

454
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:19,245
Yes.

455
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:20,406
Commissioner Hunt?

456
00:39:20,846 --> 00:39:21,147
Yes.

457
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:22,748
Commissioner Brzezinski?

458
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:44,464
yes yes on the motion on the vote of four to nothing the motion is approved uh mr gomes the uh unfortunately the petition was not successful um we have uh we weigh these uh requests and balancing them against the uh rights of private say

459
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:51,699
property owners and the availability of public parking, which is getting less and less as time goes by.

460
00:39:52,179 --> 00:40:00,269
I will state that there is availability of parking on Pembroke Street, Bradshaw, and Spring Street, if that helps.

461
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:03,993
I understand it's a few minutes more walking, but

462
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:10,138
I think that based on the vote tonight, that that's where we have to go.

463
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:15,619
Do you understand where we are right now with this petition?

464
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,520
I send him an unmute.

465
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:33,462
Chief, can we also advise him that if there's no emergency, he can park on the East Side Streets, where Spring Street is a major item.

466
00:40:34,422 --> 00:40:34,902
Mr. Galls?

467
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:41,104
Mr. Gomes, can you unmute yourself?

468
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:44,067
He direct messaged me, yes.

469
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:46,429
So I'm just gonna message him.

470
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:48,351
Okay.

471
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:55,257
And Commissioner Hantia, do you also advise him, as Sasha Rogers points out, should there be a snowstorm or an emergency?

472
00:40:56,578 --> 00:41:00,201
Spring Street would be off limits, but he's allowed to park on any of the side streets at that point.

473
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:06,507
So he'd be free to, he would be more availability for parking in that case.

474
00:41:09,103 --> 00:41:10,784
Yes, he wrote back, I understood.

475
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:16,727
Okay, thank you.

476
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:21,729
2025-14, no parking at a corner distance of 30 feet on Park Street at Park Street Court.

477
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:24,690
Sergeant Rogers, and I believe you have Director Blake to assist you.

478
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:35,676
Chief, I've received a couple of complaints on residents from Park Street Court that when they attempt to pull out on the Park Street, the cars are parked so close

479
00:41:37,697 --> 00:41:40,099
that they have no view of oncoming traffic.

480
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:47,545
There have been near collisions, although I looked up, there have not been any actual collisions.

481
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:58,353
Speaking with Director Blake, he came up to put up a sign, Park Street Court looks more like a driveway than a desert street.

482
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,636
That would explain why they're parking so close.

483
00:42:04,218 --> 00:42:05,279
to it.

484
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:16,407
Director Blake, I believe that is you pulling up the images on the screen, and if you could add your input into this petition also.

485
00:42:16,427 --> 00:42:32,458
Yeah, I think when we discussed it, we were saying how it does, even though it's a street, it may be seen as more of a, like this car on the left, Alexis, is treating it more as a driveway, two feet instead of 20 feet.

486
00:42:33,605 --> 00:42:38,870
So, I think we had decided if we just signed the 20 foot restriction on either side.

487
00:42:39,511 --> 00:42:42,614
That might help with this situation here that's shown.

488
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:53,647
And by reference, excuse me, by ordinance and law, there is a 20 feet no parking on every corner.

489
00:42:53,827 --> 00:42:56,149
It's for that safety and blind spot.

490
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:07,019
And in this case, it doesn't look like it's being honored by certain people parking, but that could be directly related to the fact that it looks more like a driveway than it does look like a side street.

491
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:19,703
And so Director Blake is suggesting that one of the solutions may be simply to sign what is currently the law as it relates to corner parking as no parking on 20 feet as opposed to the 30 feet.

492
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:20,884
Is that correct, Director Blake?

493
00:43:21,204 --> 00:43:25,225
Yeah, if that's the case, then there really is no vote if we could just go with the 20.

494
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:31,868
But if someone wanted 30, then it would require a vote beyond the 20.

495
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,179
Okay, understood.

496
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:37,561
Is there any reason why this intersection needs 20?

497
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:45,486
If the problem is that people need 30, if we think the problem is actually people are parking right up to it?

498
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:50,710
Sergeant Rogers, you've received the complaints that the original petition came at 30 with 20 work.

499
00:43:52,456 --> 00:44:00,523
I believe it would, you can use Todd's line of sight phrase, but I have in trouble.

500
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:07,188
The cars are parking almost up to that mailbox and they have no view of Park Street, Southbound.

501
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:16,016
It almost looks like there was a sign maybe here at one point years ago, pre-2007.

502
00:44:22,547 --> 00:44:42,938
So if Director Blake is suggesting that the petition could be modified to fit the current rule of 20 feet, the Traffic Commission would only really have to vote, and not that we even have to do that, but to have the corners signed appropriately to reflect the rule.

503
00:44:48,377 --> 00:44:53,359
You can also enforce, but the sign informs people what will be enforced.

504
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,221
You work with Sarah and just enforce as well, I guess.

505
00:44:58,281 --> 00:44:59,382
Signage and enforcement.

506
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:01,622
That would be more of what we like.

507
00:45:01,683 --> 00:45:03,723
Commissioners, questions, thoughts, and concerns?

508
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:06,004
What's the sign scene like down there?

509
00:45:06,024 --> 00:45:10,666
Are there signs all over the place, or do you have a low number of signs?

510
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:13,187
Todd, do you know?

511
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,213
It does not appear that there's many signs.

512
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:27,476
This telephone pole's on the opposite side of the street with signs, but it doesn't look like there's any U-channels currently out there, besides the dead-end street name sign.

513
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:31,097
Yeah.

514
00:45:31,377 --> 00:45:34,478
Ty, can you go to your screen where you can actually draw distances?

515
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:36,659
Yeah, sure.

516
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:41,761
Sometimes it's difficult with the trees, but let's see.

517
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:45,649
Yeah, so this tree is blocking up here.

518
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:59,956
On this side, you kind of see 20 feet brings you measure from there, brings you like there, and we think it leaves one space between that sign and the driveway.

519
00:46:00,616 --> 00:46:01,977
Then same thing on the other side.

520
00:46:02,017 --> 00:46:05,319
I think we were trying to be cognizant of what's left over.

521
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:11,722
So if you do 20, we think there's enough space, you know,

522
00:46:13,634 --> 00:46:17,057
another, you know, it doesn't eliminate all parking on either side.

523
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:17,597
Let's see.

524
00:46:17,637 --> 00:46:25,264
So, trying to get an angle that shows how much would be remaining.

525
00:46:25,364 --> 00:46:33,090
So, in this block here, Steve, if 20 feet was restricted, there's at least one space left over before the next driveway.

526
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,632
Same thing over here.

527
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,054
It looks like 20 feet restricted.

528
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:41,918
You might have one space remaining instead of this squeezing two in right now.

529
00:46:42,923 --> 00:46:45,004
God, where Park Street is a one-way.

530
00:46:45,044 --> 00:46:47,964
I'm not really concerned where that car is parked over there.

531
00:46:47,984 --> 00:46:48,385
Oh, got it.

532
00:46:48,425 --> 00:46:48,865
That's right.

533
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:53,046
Yeah, so only we can start with the approaching side if you wanted to be.

534
00:46:53,306 --> 00:46:55,106
It's on them as they pull out to the left.

535
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:56,647
Correct.

536
00:46:56,667 --> 00:47:01,688
So this spot is more because cars are traveling, as Sergeant R just said, this direction.

537
00:47:02,308 --> 00:47:07,850
So it's more important for this vehicle exiting to see this direction right here.

538
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,171
So it's the spot that we're talking about.

539
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:21,127
That is the side that Sergeant Rogers originally had in the agenda, so this is the focus.

540
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:28,934
Yeah, so Tim, to your point, it doesn't look like there's many U-channels in the area.

541
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:30,095
There's telephone poles.

542
00:47:31,356 --> 00:47:34,398
And why can't this problem be solved with enforcement?

543
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:39,483
Let the enforcement folks speak.

544
00:47:40,963 --> 00:47:47,184
Tim, I just wanted a sign to point out the law.

545
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:50,405
Because obviously they don't get it down there.

546
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:52,705
It's a problem spot is what I'm hearing.

547
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:00,527
So one sign, go parking here to corner?

548
00:48:01,227 --> 00:48:01,587
Correct.

549
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:03,447
Can we start with 20 feet?

550
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:04,827
20 feet's the law, right?

551
00:48:05,788 --> 00:48:07,108
Correct.

552
00:48:07,128 --> 00:48:08,008
30 feet would require us.

553
00:48:09,688 --> 00:48:10,910
to grant a variance?

554
00:48:12,331 --> 00:48:22,080
Correct, and I thought, Todd, if I'm not mistaken, 30 feet would have some issues with the parking and the driveway.

555
00:48:22,101 --> 00:48:24,503
30, we thought it might impact that second parking space.

556
00:48:24,523 --> 00:48:30,269
We're trying to be sensitive, so 20 might be enough to provide the sight line and still preserve a parking space.

557
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:39,036
Can we start with just, I mean, I know it's the law, but there's a lot of laws I don't know of and I don't mind putting a sign up because I do see them through town.

558
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:42,258
Can we start with 20 and just dedicate a sign?

559
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:45,339
Tim, I don't think, is that an issue to dedicate a sign?

560
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,302
Well, we can't start with 20 and then move to 30 because then we put up two signs.

561
00:48:50,522 --> 00:48:52,043
So we should add two signposts.

562
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:53,344
So we should pick one.

563
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,065
30 will allow for a parking spot?

564
00:48:55,085 --> 00:48:55,966
I guess Todd said no.

565
00:49:02,615 --> 00:49:02,815
Right.

566
00:49:02,955 --> 00:49:10,841
I mean, I like the 20 feet because that allows somebody to still park there, but it makes it really clear that there's not two parking spots.

567
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:16,744
And if you put it at 30, then you're going to have people like blocking that driveway behind them, right?

568
00:49:16,764 --> 00:49:18,666
They're going to try and squeeze in anyhow.

569
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:21,167
And be like, why can't I park here?

570
00:49:21,748 --> 00:49:25,770
This is something I would just ask an engineer, Todd, to tell us where to put it.

571
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,951
20 or 30.

572
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:27,832
What's the safest?

573
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:30,053
It's about sight distance and safety on that turn.

574
00:49:30,073 --> 00:49:30,113
So.

575
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:40,283
So are you comfortable with approving it as me and Larry will go through and measure it and mark if we think it's appropriate?

576
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:46,944
Yeah, 20 or 30 as measured out by the engineering division.

577
00:49:46,964 --> 00:49:47,004
OK.

578
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:56,666
Yeah, you're seeing one stump is better than two.

579
00:49:56,686 --> 00:49:59,727
Sergeant Rogers, are you OK with that if we just give Todd leeway?

580
00:50:01,012 --> 00:50:02,133
Absolutely.

581
00:50:02,253 --> 00:50:03,654
Again, I want 20 feet.

582
00:50:03,674 --> 00:50:05,275
It's not an issue.

583
00:50:06,656 --> 00:50:12,280
Okay, before the commission's motion, I just want to make sure nobody in the public wants to speak in this matter.

584
00:50:14,182 --> 00:50:20,787
Is there anyone present who wishes to speak for or against this signage?

585
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:28,892
Okay, seeing none, I defer back to the commissioners.

586
00:50:30,317 --> 00:50:36,679
And if at all possible, I formulate a quick motion on this to.

587
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:48,263
Motion to approve 20 to 30 feet based off of layout by engineering division.

588
00:50:51,764 --> 00:50:52,465
With signage.

589
00:50:53,785 --> 00:50:54,425
With signage, yep.

590
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:59,207
Okay, on the motion of Commissioner McGibbon to approve

591
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:14,233
2025-14, giving the Director of Traffic and Engineer the ability to review the layout 20 to 30 feet and sign it appropriately.

592
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:15,394
Do I have a second?

593
00:51:17,234 --> 00:51:17,635
Second.

594
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:22,922
seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

595
00:51:23,442 --> 00:51:24,183
Bravo roll call.

596
00:51:24,663 --> 00:51:25,543
Commissioner McGibbon?

597
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:26,324
Yes.

598
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:27,685
Commissioner Hunt?

599
00:51:27,925 --> 00:51:28,165
Yes.

600
00:51:28,865 --> 00:51:29,946
Commissioner Brzezinski?

601
00:51:30,366 --> 00:51:30,606
Yes.

602
00:51:31,186 --> 00:51:31,847
Chief Buckley?

603
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:32,247
Yes.

604
00:51:32,347 --> 00:51:36,329
On a vote of four to nothing, the petition is approved.

605
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:37,910
May I ask one question?

606
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,372
What corner on Park Street Todd usually gives?

607
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,073
It would be the north.

608
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:49,136
It'd be the west side of Park Street.

609
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:51,406
the north side of Park Street Court.

610
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:56,130
Agreed, Director Blake?

611
00:51:57,851 --> 00:52:01,414
Yeah, west side of Park, 20 to 30 feet north of Park Court.

612
00:52:05,777 --> 00:52:06,177
Thank you.

613
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:10,080
Okay.

614
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:15,184
2025-15, Salem Street Municipal Parking Lot, Designate Business Parking Only.

615
00:52:15,805 --> 00:52:18,667
Special Projects Coordinator Jim Silva, the floor is yours.

616
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:37,974
Yes, we spoke of this last meeting in regards to some of the abutters that were interested in how the status of this law changed from a municipal public parking lot to a special type of status to allow parking.

617
00:52:37,994 --> 00:52:46,177
It's our understanding that the assessor's office denoted this as a property owned by Verizon and not the city of Medford.

618
00:52:47,238 --> 00:53:03,060
At that time, it was recommended that we would change the status for that special parking program, which is business slash health care at this point versus deriving income from a property we don't own.

619
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:06,603
So the designation was changed.

620
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:18,811
We just want an official perspective on this and on the books as a business slash or business parking lot, which allows health care folks to park in there as well.

621
00:53:22,253 --> 00:53:24,195
Okay, so no real change.

622
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:27,357
Just trying to memorialize the traffic commission.

623
00:53:27,477 --> 00:53:30,339
What is currently in place that fair enough?

624
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:36,562
I didn't miss that all together.

625
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:44,904
Great, I thought we'd voted on this already, so.

626
00:53:47,785 --> 00:53:49,865
Yes, I guess that's my question.

627
00:53:50,106 --> 00:53:57,308
Or I guess maybe I thought we were told we couldn't do it, so I may have assumed we didn't even need to vote.

628
00:53:57,428 --> 00:53:59,808
Do we have any jurisdiction here, if it's not our lot?

629
00:54:00,148 --> 00:54:00,488
Right.

630
00:54:06,861 --> 00:54:08,602
I guess that's a point of clarification.

631
00:54:08,622 --> 00:54:10,502
It is not the city's lot.

632
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:11,382
It's not our lot.

633
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:28,488
National Grid owns it, but my understanding is they've given us permission to use it for public parking, but the problem is that the assessor has concerns about us making money off of something that we don't own.

634
00:54:28,908 --> 00:54:30,628
Right.

635
00:54:31,229 --> 00:54:34,950
We don't have a written operating agreement or lease agreement with the lot?

636
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:35,630
Yeah.

637
00:54:36,842 --> 00:54:39,665
We need 1, this was somewhat of a discovery.

638
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:42,889
And so there was a lot of back taxes that were involved.

639
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,951
So, I sort of.

640
00:54:47,544 --> 00:54:57,412
I've been waiting for a little bit of information, but again, I think we were acting prudently to not to derive income off this particular location.

641
00:54:57,512 --> 00:55:00,835
Certainly they provided the lot to the City of Medford.

642
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:07,200
Just a special program is doable in case there's any issue or pushback.

643
00:55:08,732 --> 00:55:10,874
But the health care use, who is that?

644
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:12,936
Is that for the group across the street?

645
00:55:13,696 --> 00:55:15,938
Actually, no, it's for health care workers.

646
00:55:16,198 --> 00:55:28,048
I believe you all voted on including health care pass holders to park in business parking throughout the city as an additional location.

647
00:55:28,609 --> 00:55:30,450
So yes, health care pass.

648
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,232
So they're in a special program as well.

649
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:41,251
But one last question, I promise to leave you alone, but we can't give the owner of the after school care.

650
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:46,118
Use of a space in this lot from my understanding.

651
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:46,178
No.

652
00:55:48,903 --> 00:56:01,726
I guess there could be a petition for that, but actually, if you look at the next item on the list, we've included some additional parking or some potential changes in that location that seem to satisfy the abutter.

653
00:56:02,366 --> 00:56:06,446
I'll let Sarah speak on that in the next step, but that seems to work for her.

654
00:56:06,686 --> 00:56:13,868
We had some business parking that we could not find the history of that on Salem Street, the street itself.

655
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:24,530
So we pulled that business parking off there, made it just metered parking for public and moved the business people into the business.

656
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,511
So we sort of swapped out when we made this change last year.

657
00:56:29,371 --> 00:56:34,532
But she and her employees could get business permits and could park there.

658
00:56:34,712 --> 00:56:38,453
It's just available to her clients as a public.

659
00:56:38,993 --> 00:56:39,313
I see.

660
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:39,873
That's right.

661
00:56:40,073 --> 00:56:40,313
Okay.

662
00:56:42,175 --> 00:56:45,841
I mean, if this is just memorializing exactly what's going on motion.

663
00:56:47,263 --> 00:56:47,603
Hold on.

664
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:49,666
Oh, sorry, Tim.

665
00:56:50,848 --> 00:56:57,258
Yeah, we don't want to preclude any potential agreement between a private landowner in the city.

666
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:01,615
So we're the authority on off-street parking lots.

667
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:03,396
But this is not an off-street parking lot.

668
00:57:03,956 --> 00:57:10,679
This is a private parking lot that has a handshake agreement between the city and a private entity.

669
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:22,683
So what we should do, I believe, and I'm obviously not the only one on this commission, we should probably advise the mayor to enter an agreement if she hasn't already

670
00:57:25,865 --> 00:57:30,428
And then to give us her view over the parking lot in that agreement.

671
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:36,973
Because that agreement can solve a lot of issues here, like the people next door and you parking that child place or whatever.

672
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:39,535
So, we don't want to preclude anything that.

673
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:42,717
The mayor might want to do an agreement with this other.

674
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,739
So that's my stance on this.

675
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:45,940
I don't think we have authority anyway.

676
00:57:46,682 --> 00:57:57,690
But I do believe that part of the problem is that they've been trying to get an agreement for a while, and National Grid actually moves more slowly than government.

677
00:57:59,271 --> 00:58:01,413
And somebody should be parking there in the meantime.

678
00:58:02,374 --> 00:58:03,434
Yeah.

679
00:58:03,454 --> 00:58:09,839
So it might stay at a handshake back of the envelope agreement for a little while, but it really needs to be inked.

680
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:14,983
As chair, I suggest that this

681
00:58:19,383 --> 00:58:20,844
parking at municipal parking lots.

682
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:23,305
I don't see how this falls under either.

683
00:58:25,146 --> 00:58:29,949
Yeah, that was my secondary point, which I don't even think we have any authority here.

684
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:39,114
If the mayor gives us authority through an agreement that she signs with another entity that says the Traffic Commission has purview over it as a public parking lot, so be it, then we do.

685
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:44,998
But didn't Jim say that we have done something in the past on this lot already?

686
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:46,839
Mistakenly.

687
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,100
We thought the city owned it.

688
00:58:56,022 --> 00:58:57,422
Now we know the city doesn't own it.

689
00:58:58,683 --> 00:59:01,964
Correct.

690
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:04,366
As an attorney, I definitely support Tim's position.

691
00:59:04,446 --> 00:59:12,710
I would love for us to get some operating agreement in place, particularly that at night you can actually lease it out to all the people coming to the Chevalier, but we don't have that.

692
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:17,252
To the extent it's not applicable, let's get rid of it and move on.

693
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:24,464
And maybe this is a question for Alva, but could we generate a recommendation through the mayor via traffic commission?

694
00:59:27,805 --> 00:59:29,226
Tim, that's an interesting point.

695
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:38,450
I actually suggest that if the mayor enters an agreement with a private entity regarding parking, she can just do that on her own and would not even need traffic commission approval.

696
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:41,053
Yeah, she doesn't need our approval.

697
00:59:41,073 --> 00:59:44,434
That's my first point was we shouldn't preclude anything that the mayor would do.

698
00:59:44,955 --> 00:59:57,879
So if we say we voted, like if we said we're memorializing this into, you know, business parking, and then later on she enters an agreement with that entity that contradicts that, then, you know, we're kind of in a problem.

699
00:59:58,179 --> 01:00:03,480
Or if we have to unwind that so she can make some sort of agreement, even though we don't have authority.

700
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,301
It just creates a mess that we don't need to create.

701
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:07,061
Agreed.

702
01:00:09,102 --> 01:00:19,086
And that goes along with the, we don't have the authority type stuff, but what I suggested that the mayor did enter an agreement, she would have the authority to basically say, we can allow a business parking here.

703
01:00:19,406 --> 01:00:26,029
It's a non-regulatory issue for the Traffic Commission and it's private property with an agreement.

704
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:28,710
So I don't know that this has to come back to us at all.

705
01:00:33,372 --> 01:00:34,012
Commissioner Hunt?

706
01:00:35,212 --> 01:00:36,633
Sorry, I'm just clearing my throat.

707
01:00:43,596 --> 01:00:55,018
I mean, I'm concerned that any decision by us tonight might be set aside when this is memorialized between a private entity and the city.

708
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,220
I mean, we can place on file and

709
01:01:11,129 --> 01:01:13,051
inform the mayor that we placed on file?

710
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:16,934
I don't know.

711
01:01:17,955 --> 01:01:23,079
I'll make a motion to inform the mayor that we placed on file.

712
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:25,181
In other words, inform the mayor we took no action on it.

713
01:01:28,183 --> 01:01:33,208
On the motion of Commissioner McGibbon to place petition 2025-15 on file, do I have a second?

714
01:01:33,228 --> 01:01:33,348
Second.

715
01:01:39,803 --> 01:01:41,305
seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

716
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:44,007
Commissioner McGibbon?

717
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:44,728
Yes.

718
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:46,249
Commissioner Hunt?

719
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:46,770
Yes.

720
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:48,492
Commissioner Brzezinski?

721
01:01:49,017 --> 01:01:49,317
Yes.

722
01:01:50,077 --> 01:01:50,778
Chief Buckley.

723
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:56,439
Yes, on the vote of four nothing petition has been placed on file 2025-16.

724
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:04,762
Change the spaces in front of 36 Salem Street from 30 minutes to two hours and replace time monitor devices with standard meter heads.

725
01:02:05,202 --> 01:02:09,443
Special projects coordinator Jim Silva, the floor is again yours.

726
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:19,252
This is the spaces in front of Pure Hockey that are currently the three spaces that have the monitoring devices.

727
01:02:21,293 --> 01:02:30,238
In the request for the abutter to the business parking lot, wanted to ensure that there was at least two-hour parking.

728
01:02:30,598 --> 01:02:33,880
I'm going to turn this over to Sarah.

729
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,982
She had a conversation with the Pure Hockey folks as well.

730
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:39,500
Thank you.

731
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,562
Director McDermott, the floor is yours.

732
01:02:52,992 --> 01:02:54,113
We can't hear you.

733
01:02:55,594 --> 01:02:56,415
Unless that's me.

734
01:02:57,096 --> 01:02:57,856
I can't hear either.

735
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:01,519
We heard you earlier.

736
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:02,781
Yeah, that's strange.

737
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:03,301
Can you hear me?

738
01:03:03,922 --> 01:03:04,362
Now we do.

739
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:04,622
Yes.

740
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:05,283
Okay.

741
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:30,041
So I reached out to Pure Hockey, the manager of Pure Hockey, since the last Traffic Commission meeting, and they have no objection to us changing the meters, the three spaces out front from 30-minute free parking to two-hour paid metered parking, because they have so much parking in the back of their store, which they seem to believe people know about and utilize regularly.

742
01:03:30,141 --> 01:03:36,142
So additionally, I spoke to our meter foreperson, Mike Viola, and we do have

743
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:44,252
the necessary equipment to swap those meters out and change them without any cost to the city with what we already have in inventory.

744
01:03:44,272 --> 01:03:52,381
And I see no reason not to make this change as it will satisfy

745
01:03:53,683 --> 01:04:04,311
the request of the business there who lost that lot for their customers unexpectedly and, you know, involuntarily, which by everybody.

746
01:04:04,391 --> 01:04:09,896
So I think it's a reasonable request on her part and I'm supportive of it.

747
01:04:11,457 --> 01:04:12,798
And that's really all I've got to say.

748
01:04:13,018 --> 01:04:14,500
Is there any questions about it?

749
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:15,300
Yeah.

750
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:18,443
We also want to add this space here.

751
01:04:23,616 --> 01:04:28,420
I'm not sure if, Todd, I'm all for adding that space if the measurements are correct.

752
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:38,269
I don't know if we have the inventory or the equipment to add a meter there, but we can always make it something if there's enough room.

753
01:04:38,489 --> 01:04:48,938
Todd, that curb was original, just a new curb added to that location.

754
01:04:52,634 --> 01:04:57,958
Yes, it looks like there was some work done when that business was rehabbed.

755
01:04:58,158 --> 01:05:04,702
Yeah, the curb cut used to be right here, kind of on the edge of this parking lot we were talking about earlier.

756
01:05:05,843 --> 01:05:09,525
Now it is all the way over here.

757
01:05:10,226 --> 01:05:10,726
Wonderful.

758
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:16,330
So we may be able to stripe this a little differently and fit to and add a space here.

759
01:05:16,987 --> 01:05:19,768
But I don't think, yeah, my apologies for jumping the gun.

760
01:05:19,788 --> 01:05:24,650
We were talking about these three over here, but it's related, so.

761
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:27,392
So these three.

762
01:05:27,412 --> 01:05:41,178
So commissioners, in dealing with it, let's talk about the three spaces, 36 South Street.

763
01:05:43,059 --> 01:05:45,700
It appears to resolve some of our

764
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,106
before I go to the public.

765
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,591
I see none.

766
01:05:57,691 --> 01:06:00,554
Does anyone in the public have a wish to address that?

767
01:06:01,936 --> 01:06:02,577
I do have a question.

768
01:06:02,597 --> 01:06:03,377
I'm sorry, I'm slow.

769
01:06:05,179 --> 01:06:10,105
Have we made this known to Pure Hockey, like all the kind of abutting businesses?

770
01:06:12,308 --> 01:06:14,609
your hockey right now is the only a budding business.

771
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:17,769
There's no other business in the building where the village play spaces.

772
01:06:18,589 --> 01:06:23,911
Um, and that's the only other building or the only other business on that block.

773
01:06:24,591 --> 01:06:25,311
Okay.

774
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:25,651
Thank you.

775
01:06:26,491 --> 01:06:29,552
And they have no objection repeating what you said earlier, correct?

776
01:06:29,672 --> 01:06:30,072
Yeah.

777
01:06:30,092 --> 01:06:30,672
Okay.

778
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:31,092
Excellent.

779
01:06:31,132 --> 01:06:31,232
Yeah.

780
01:06:36,217 --> 01:06:41,839
Does anyone in the public wish to speak to, for, or against petition 2025-16?

781
01:06:41,859 --> 01:06:55,743
Seeing none, commissioners, I leave it to you for a motion for further discussion.

782
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:06,677
I would move to approve these as two-hour spots and include the additional spot if there is, in fact, engineering agrees the space is there.

783
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,420
I think they just said, but I know.

784
01:07:12,575 --> 01:07:34,332
Okay, so on the motion of Commissioner Hart to approve 2025-16, which would change the spaces on 36 Salem Street from 30 minutes to two hours parking, and replace the monitor devices with standard meter heads, and to include the one or possibly two additional parking spaces just forward of them.

785
01:07:34,773 --> 01:07:35,573
Do I have a second?

786
01:07:36,434 --> 01:07:36,674
Second.

787
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:38,976
Seconded by Commissioner McGiven.

788
01:07:38,996 --> 01:07:41,498
Outlaw, full call, please.

789
01:07:42,589 --> 01:07:43,490
Commissioner McGibbon?

790
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,450
Yes.

791
01:07:45,091 --> 01:07:45,931
Commissioner Hunt?

792
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:47,032
Yes.

793
01:07:47,853 --> 01:07:49,074
Commissioner Brzezinski?

794
01:07:49,474 --> 01:07:49,714
Yes.

795
01:07:50,595 --> 01:07:51,255
Chief Buckley?

796
01:07:51,415 --> 01:07:51,635
Yes.

797
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,357
On the vote of four to nothing, the motion is approved.

798
01:07:54,377 --> 01:07:54,397
2025-17.

799
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:59,281
Chief, could we take 2025-19 out of order because the petitioner needs to leave to go back to work?

800
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:19,658
We shortly end on the request of Commissioner Hunt to take the motion on order 2025-19, permit parking variance from Mr. Richard Koenigsmann, 23 Burgett Ave.

801
01:08:20,118 --> 01:08:24,221
If the petitioner is present, we're gonna ask you to unmute and the floor will be yours.

802
01:08:26,383 --> 01:08:27,904
Welcome to the Traffic Commission.

803
01:08:27,924 --> 01:08:31,247
Hello, thanks for having me.

804
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:32,841
How are you, sir?

805
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:35,583
Thank you for coming and presenting before us.

806
01:08:35,843 --> 01:08:40,667
Do you want to give us a little description and understanding of your request?

807
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:42,448
Yes, thank you.

808
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:50,595
So I am running an internship in Boston and in the Boston church.

809
01:08:51,596 --> 01:08:58,982
And I got a car from the Boston church, which is a commercial car, but it is unlettered.

810
01:09:00,944 --> 01:09:11,554
receiving multiple parking tickets I realized that I'm not allowed to park an unlettered and a commercial car overnight in Medford.

811
01:09:12,755 --> 01:09:18,020
So I would like to request a parking variance in Medford.

812
01:09:20,267 --> 01:09:21,248
Okay.

813
01:09:21,348 --> 01:09:28,772
Thank you for presenting that and I'm going to go to the commissioners if you could just stand by potentially answer any questions they might have.

814
01:09:29,452 --> 01:09:34,014
To the commissioners, the petitioner has presented his certificate of registration.

815
01:09:34,075 --> 01:09:36,436
It is on a 2014 Ford Focus.

816
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:45,841
It does have commercial plates, but as the petitioner has indicated, there are no other markings indicating traditional commercial vehicles.

817
01:09:45,861 --> 01:09:47,082
So,

818
01:09:51,847 --> 01:10:00,434
Is there any question about permit parking in this area or is this simply an issue of being allowed to park overnight?

819
01:10:01,494 --> 01:10:03,396
Because this is a permit parking street.

820
01:10:06,718 --> 01:10:08,760
A resident permit.

821
01:10:10,441 --> 01:10:14,764
I believe he said he had a commercial plate or a commercial vehicle.

822
01:10:16,265 --> 01:10:16,546
Right.

823
01:10:16,606 --> 01:10:18,067
But is it registered in Medford?

824
01:10:19,975 --> 01:10:22,596
it is registered technically out of Framingham.

825
01:10:23,096 --> 01:10:24,336
Right.

826
01:10:24,496 --> 01:10:25,897
It's this problem, right?

827
01:10:26,037 --> 01:10:34,159
It's both that it's commercial, but it's not just commercial plates, it's that he's parking in the G zone.

828
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:46,223
I think that just granting the commercial isn't good enough, he also needs permission to park in the G zone.

829
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:58,216
And this is exactly one of the type of reason that I've brought up that we ought to have some rulings to allow commercial vehicles because sometimes it is your transportation.

830
01:10:58,236 --> 01:11:05,641
It's not like it's a commercial truck that ought to be kept in the parking lot of your business.

831
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:12,104
It's provided to him to drive between his business and do his internship.

832
01:11:14,386 --> 01:11:14,626
Yeah.

833
01:11:15,454 --> 01:11:23,981
If I may, there's also the question, if it's in framing or something, not being a Medford registration, we don't get this excise tax.

834
01:11:24,102 --> 01:11:26,323
Also, it looks like that host has a driveway.

835
01:11:26,804 --> 01:11:31,968
So is there a reason why they can't use the driveway and whoever doesn't have the commercial park on the street?

836
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:39,014
Okay, Mr. Collins, can you speak to that?

837
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:43,512
As director Blake indicates, there appears to be a driveway.

838
01:11:43,552 --> 01:11:44,774
Can you park in the driveway?

839
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:45,895
Is that a possibility?

840
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:50,259
No, parking in the driveway is not a possibility.

841
01:11:50,719 --> 01:12:03,472
The house I'm living in, the household, is divided in two apartments, and the driveway is only accessible for half of the apartment.

842
01:12:09,734 --> 01:12:12,015
Okay, thank you for that response.

843
01:12:14,256 --> 01:12:16,277
To the Commissioner, this is an age-old question.

844
01:12:16,337 --> 01:12:21,899
We keep getting, you know, here and there we get these requests for people to park their commercial vehicles on our streets.

845
01:12:22,499 --> 01:12:26,981
We have had a long-standing rule against commercial, no overnight commercial parking.

846
01:12:29,082 --> 01:12:32,703
Does not make this an easy question for debate.

847
01:12:35,648 --> 01:12:38,252
Did we have this last week?

848
01:12:39,194 --> 01:12:39,755
Or last month?

849
01:12:43,251 --> 01:12:50,476
What does it look like on Boston Ave or just trying to look at the agenda or the minutes?

850
01:12:50,836 --> 01:12:52,978
This has come up before.

851
01:12:53,418 --> 01:13:01,884
There was a young man who had an actual work van with tools and stuff and he lived at his parents' house.

852
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:06,428
His parents were like, we need the driveway and he needs to park on the street.

853
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,201
I feel like we approved that one.

854
01:13:10,961 --> 01:13:11,401
I'm sorry.

855
01:13:11,421 --> 01:13:20,683
No, I was just going to say, I mean, didn't the gentleman from last month, I want to say we denied it, but I'm just trying to straighten the table a bit.

856
01:13:20,723 --> 01:13:26,805
This is the gentleman who lives on his corner house on Holton and Hobbit and he has that big

857
01:13:27,385 --> 01:13:29,527
driveway and back, and he has his commercial vehicles.

858
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:32,849
We did table that for similar concerns.

859
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:38,213
I will add to Commissioner Hunt, because you actually reminded me of something.

860
01:13:38,233 --> 01:13:48,401
We did approve that, and that was probably maybe two years ago, but it turned out to be a problem because I believe the parking department was not able to do what we had approved.

861
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:51,964
So based on that, I'm going to see if

862
01:13:52,764 --> 01:13:54,789
Director McDermott could weigh in on this.

863
01:13:54,929 --> 01:14:00,803
Is it possible to grant the variance to a commercial motor vehicle plate for resident permit parking?

864
01:14:01,184 --> 01:14:02,206
I believe that's what...

865
01:14:03,174 --> 01:14:08,377
prevented us from doing it the last time, and it was a very much debated issue either way.

866
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:14,760
And I know you're new here to the city right now, but I don't know if that's a possibility to the system.

867
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:23,424
Could you put a commercial motor vehicle that's registered outside of the city into our system and give them a resident private parking pass?

868
01:14:29,927 --> 01:14:30,968
Can you hear me, Sarah?

869
01:14:35,226 --> 01:14:36,086
Sorry, we can't hear you.

870
01:14:36,207 --> 01:14:36,487
Sorry.

871
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:43,830
Hello?

872
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:45,411
Now we got you.

873
01:14:45,451 --> 01:14:47,392
I don't know what's up with that.

874
01:14:47,432 --> 01:14:48,092
Sorry, everybody.

875
01:14:49,053 --> 01:14:49,873
Now you're very low.

876
01:14:49,893 --> 01:14:50,734
We can barely hear you.

877
01:14:51,234 --> 01:14:52,655
We can hear you, but it's really low.

878
01:14:57,957 --> 01:15:01,219
I can tell you how to raise the volume on it if you don't know, but.

879
01:15:01,659 --> 01:15:02,780
We have one note.

880
01:15:06,182 --> 01:15:07,363
things maxed out.

881
01:15:07,983 --> 01:15:10,064
My microphone is at the highest volume.

882
01:15:13,246 --> 01:15:16,367
The fraction of an inch you leaned in, you got much louder.

883
01:15:17,268 --> 01:15:19,629
I guess you're just going to have to stare at my face.

884
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:20,649
Can you hear me now?

885
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,551
We have you now, yes.

886
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:26,592
We can issue a permit really to any car.

887
01:15:26,853 --> 01:15:33,136
It's just a matter of not doing it because it's setting a precedent and that's going to be the one exception

888
01:15:34,609 --> 01:15:36,891
It's going to be a car that isn't garaged in Medford.

889
01:15:38,052 --> 01:15:40,814
It's going to be a commercial vehicle getting a variance.

890
01:15:41,475 --> 01:15:43,796
It's got two variances it's requesting.

891
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:52,183
Because generally, if we're issuing a residential permit, that car is garaged at a Medford address.

892
01:15:53,164 --> 01:15:57,808
The person doesn't have to live in Medford per se, but that car has to live in Medford.

893
01:15:58,966 --> 01:16:02,208
So we can do most anything.

894
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:09,852
I could register a car from Florida with a Medford permit, but we don't as a general rule.

895
01:16:11,774 --> 01:16:14,395
Thank you for that clear explanation.

896
01:16:16,336 --> 01:16:17,257
I want to go back.

897
01:16:19,225 --> 01:16:25,571
Also, I think it may be maybe a third permit to Sarah, like Alicia was saying, there's also the resident permit piece of it.

898
01:16:25,851 --> 01:16:31,556
So even if you got past the garage code in the commercial, they can park on St.

899
01:16:31,616 --> 01:16:33,558
George Street and non G zone.

900
01:16:33,878 --> 01:16:37,821
But then if you want to G zone on Burgett, then that's a third thing.

901
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:42,766
Because George Street, I was trying to highlight on the map, it's only about 400 feet away.

902
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:44,247
It's non resident street.

903
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:49,376
but G-Zone would allow this commercial vehicle to park anywhere.

904
01:16:50,056 --> 01:16:53,298
We've already sort of ruled on it if we grant this petition.

905
01:16:55,158 --> 01:17:02,361
Chief, is there an ordinance that was passed by city council that says specifically that you can't park a commercial vehicle overnight?

906
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:04,042
I'm curious about that.

907
01:17:04,642 --> 01:17:07,643
I think we try to do a little bit of research in regards to that.

908
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,121
And that was the argument in the past.

909
01:17:10,661 --> 01:17:11,041
Correct.

910
01:17:11,101 --> 01:17:16,842
We have an ordinance in place that does not allow commercial motor vehicles to park overnight in the city.

911
01:17:19,663 --> 01:17:20,443
Passed in 2002.

912
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:23,724
Coordinator Alva passed in 2002.

913
01:17:23,924 --> 01:17:36,788
I mean, practically, even though he said the driveway space is associated with the other unit, he could potentially have a private conversation between the two units and work out some deal.

914
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:42,384
you know, because there wouldn't be an issue with the other unit getting a G zone permit if it's a residential car.

915
01:17:44,084 --> 01:17:45,664
Valid point, Director Blake.

916
01:17:47,045 --> 01:17:48,645
Let me do some business here.

917
01:17:48,685 --> 01:17:53,706
Is there anyone in the public here who wishes to speak for or against this petition?

918
01:17:53,726 --> 01:17:59,247
Just raise a hand, wave.

919
01:18:00,847 --> 01:18:04,588
Seeing none, I'd like to go back to the petitioner.

920
01:18:06,995 --> 01:18:14,300
Do you understand what's been said so far and the concerns that the Traffic Commission have?

921
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:21,666
And do you have any questions of us at this time, Mr. Collins?

922
01:18:23,567 --> 01:18:24,648
Yes, thank you.

923
01:18:24,668 --> 01:18:26,669
Yes, I do understand everything.

924
01:18:26,689 --> 01:18:36,517
And maybe to answer the question that was posed, having a conversation

925
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:53,611
with other people parking in the driveway, be helpful because I believe the other household has, I think up to five, and my household has five people as well.

926
01:18:54,472 --> 01:18:58,876
So there's no spot for me.

927
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:06,442
The other thing I'd offer is, or for consideration for the commission,

928
01:19:07,316 --> 01:19:20,546
And I'm just stating what I think may contribute is someone having, you know, generally not the specific, someone having a vehicle given to them by any business that they work for in Medford or elsewhere.

929
01:19:21,026 --> 01:19:23,028
That's like a perk for that employee, right?

930
01:19:24,289 --> 01:19:29,113
So some things are positive, like a perk to have use of a car that you don't have to pay for yourself.

931
01:19:29,293 --> 01:19:33,236
And then there are some negatives like this, like maybe not having somewhere to park.

932
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:36,038
So that's something just to consider.

933
01:19:37,235 --> 01:19:40,138
In terms of in general, because it could be precedent setting type thing.

934
01:19:41,038 --> 01:19:45,622
You know, it's it's a perk to get a company car because you save on gas saving on all these other things.

935
01:19:45,642 --> 01:19:46,122
So maybe.

936
01:19:46,142 --> 01:19:52,427
You know, I don't know if that outweighs the perk of paying for private parking somewhere or not, but something consider.

937
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,190
This is an ordinance, right?

938
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:58,632
So I'm not even sure if we have an authority to grant grant variance to an ordinance.

939
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:04,597
We can grant variances to traffic rules and regulations and parking rules and regulations and stuff like that, but not.

940
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:10,232
from my understanding of our purview, if it's an ordinance thing.

941
01:20:11,513 --> 01:20:12,853
Yeah, I don't disagree with that.

942
01:20:12,954 --> 01:20:25,880
I would still suggest we would have to deny the petition based on those facts, but... Commissioner Kavinsky, Commissioner Hunt, any further questions for discussion of the petition?

943
01:20:26,884 --> 01:20:43,120
Sarah's point about the car, not the person, was really salient to me because if this person, say, goes away and this car is then, you know, retains ownership, then they may assign it to somebody else in Medford and then we lost track of it.

944
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:46,303
So I think that's a really important point.

945
01:20:47,306 --> 01:20:48,346
So we gotta get our act together.

946
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:49,247
I think we're in the same position.

947
01:20:49,287 --> 01:20:54,688
We gotta get our act together before we can grant these types of permissions in general, if we have the authority.

948
01:20:54,748 --> 01:20:57,289
So I would motion to deny at this point.

949
01:20:57,309 --> 01:21:08,432
Okay, on a motion of commission, I'm gonna give it to deny petition 2025-19 for permit parking variance for commercial motor vehicle.

950
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:10,613
Do I have a second?

951
01:21:14,154 --> 01:21:14,574
I'll second.

952
01:21:15,805 --> 01:21:17,626
seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

953
01:21:18,426 --> 01:21:19,407
Alba, roll call, please.

954
01:21:19,967 --> 01:21:20,887
Commissioner McGibbon?

955
01:21:21,468 --> 01:21:21,768
Yes.

956
01:21:22,728 --> 01:21:23,448
Commissioner Hunt?

957
01:21:24,489 --> 01:21:24,949
Yes.

958
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:26,730
Commissioner Brzezinski?

959
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:27,470
Yes.

960
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:28,711
Chief Buckley?

961
01:21:29,271 --> 01:21:30,952
For all the reasons stated, yes.

962
01:21:31,272 --> 01:21:32,672
On a vote of four, nothing.

963
01:21:33,253 --> 01:21:35,634
The petition is denied.

964
01:21:36,814 --> 01:21:39,956
Mr. Kohnsman, you indicated that you did understand

965
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:53,365
Your request comes with many variables that would be contrary to the rules, plus we have an ordinance in the city that would deny this.

966
01:21:53,465 --> 01:22:05,812
So with apologies and my thanks for you presenting this evening and being eloquent and understanding, I wish you a good night and I'm sorry that we could not help you out.

967
01:22:07,525 --> 01:22:14,351
2025-17 Clippership Lot Agreement for Solid Waste Storage and Pickup.

968
01:22:14,831 --> 01:22:15,632
Commissioner McGibbon.

969
01:22:15,652 --> 01:22:16,673
Sure.

970
01:22:16,693 --> 01:22:20,736
All right, so this is similar to what we did in Haines.

971
01:22:20,776 --> 01:22:33,667
That one actually didn't end up panning out, but if I could share my screen, there's a lot called the Clippership Lot, and there's a building owner by the name of the Hamilton Company.

972
01:22:35,387 --> 01:22:42,012
And if you can see those four dumpsters there, those are not, I guess, they're not really legal.

973
01:22:42,032 --> 01:22:50,460
They're not under any sort of agreement with the city, but the parking spaces are public parking spaces there that the dumpsters are in.

974
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:56,165
This is a part of our public parking arsenal that isn't really used all that much.

975
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:06,050
If you can see over near that white van, there is a parking kiosk that you can't see on the other side of that van.

976
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,072
Let me just show you this at a couple other angles.

977
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:14,454
So basically what's happening is Ebisuya, which is the Japanese market, it is in this building.

978
01:23:14,895 --> 01:23:18,797
It creates a ton of recycling boxes, basically.

979
01:23:19,277 --> 01:23:23,259
If you've driven around the square at five in the morning on a Tuesday,

980
01:23:24,081 --> 01:23:25,603
A morning, you know what I'm talking about.

981
01:23:25,643 --> 01:23:26,804
It's like a mountain of boxes.

982
01:23:27,004 --> 01:23:30,928
So they want to put another dumpster back here during that process.

983
01:23:31,028 --> 01:23:31,949
It was discovered that.

984
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:37,474
These dumpsters here are not under any sort of agreement.

985
01:23:38,836 --> 01:23:47,384
And it is a city lot, so I would like to ask permission from the commission to enter an agreement with the.

986
01:23:49,603 --> 01:23:53,425
with the building owner to use this area for trash storage.

987
01:23:53,485 --> 01:23:55,306
They have no other area, by the way.

988
01:23:55,426 --> 01:23:56,727
This building is sort of landlocked.

989
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:58,287
They have an easement in the back.

990
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:01,834
In this picture, actually, we're looking at the easement.

991
01:24:01,854 --> 01:24:04,016
The easement goes out a little bit.

992
01:24:04,496 --> 01:24:05,858
It is a geometric easement.

993
01:24:05,878 --> 01:24:22,514
In other words, it's drawn on the plan, but the text of the agreement is actually what's more important because it allows the building to have access to the parking lot for deliveries and access to its site.

994
01:24:26,147 --> 01:24:34,210
For what it's worth, it's kind of like this land that is used for both public parking and the use of the building.

995
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:37,531
As you can see, there's a loading dock that goes through here, goes through the public parking lot.

996
01:24:38,751 --> 01:24:41,072
So, let me just go look at this one more picture here.

997
01:24:41,092 --> 01:24:42,472
There you go.

998
01:24:42,492 --> 01:24:44,673
You can see the loading area here that they use.

999
01:24:44,733 --> 01:24:46,433
That is actually public parking lot area.

1000
01:24:46,733 --> 01:24:48,214
The property line kind of

1001
01:24:49,092 --> 01:24:50,552
Goes through here right here.

1002
01:24:50,572 --> 01:24:57,694
I guess you can't see my cursor, but it's off about 15 feet from that wall that you're looking at.

1003
01:24:57,714 --> 01:25:03,535
How many spaces, Tim, would you be using in the public lot?

1004
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:09,837
So, I don't know exactly how many spaces, but it's probably

1005
01:25:11,455 --> 01:25:15,398
three or four, so I put the picture up that I think best shows that.

1006
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:28,266
I'm not even sure if they're striped for spaces, and I'm not really sure the full history of this spot, but I know, as far as I can remember, there's been dumpsters here.

1007
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:31,929
The CVS, I think, had a dumpster here when CVS was there.

1008
01:25:35,285 --> 01:25:37,606
So what I'd like to do is formalize an agreement.

1009
01:25:37,626 --> 01:25:39,146
I'd like to see if I can get some screening up.

1010
01:25:39,687 --> 01:25:44,568
I'd like to see if I can get, to get it to look a little bit nicer.

1011
01:25:44,588 --> 01:25:53,632
Yeah, Tim, it looks like back to 2011, it was always used for the dumpsters.

1012
01:25:53,672 --> 01:25:56,933
So it's as far as back street view goes.

1013
01:25:57,948 --> 01:26:10,397
Yeah, and like I said, it's on the edge of their easement land, which basically gives them access loading, unloading, drive-through connection to Clippership lot and all that.

1014
01:26:10,897 --> 01:26:17,001
So I think the building owner has taken it upon themselves to just use the area for those purposes.

1015
01:26:19,777 --> 01:26:30,707
So, I just want to formalize it into an agreement because it is partially lying on city public parking lot and see if I can get some screening up and make a nicer agreement for the for the city.

1016
01:26:32,028 --> 01:26:39,254
Yeah, from another angle to my verify that since as far back as 2007, it's been used as you're describing.

1017
01:26:39,795 --> 01:26:41,836
Yeah, I think it goes all the way back to when.

1018
01:26:42,737 --> 01:26:44,739
Basically, when it was created when the easement was created.

1019
01:26:46,437 --> 01:26:49,338
Is that area actually big enough for parking spots?

1020
01:26:49,398 --> 01:27:00,942
I was looking on Google Maps, and just another angle makes it look like maybe not nose-in spots, but parallel spots might, one or two might fit there.

1021
01:27:01,402 --> 01:27:04,183
Because I guess I'm wondering, are we really losing spots?

1022
01:27:05,992 --> 01:27:12,157
Well, the thing is, is it's been used for garbage disposal and pick up for so long.

1023
01:27:13,518 --> 01:27:19,583
And this is a kind of a underused section of our clipper ship lot here on that wall.

1024
01:27:23,586 --> 01:27:23,766
Right.

1025
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:27,509
I can't imagine anybody actually ever parking there unless they lived in that building.

1026
01:27:28,627 --> 01:27:35,877
Is this also part of the city's waste program in our effort to get things containerized?

1027
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:45,450
So part of this request is to memorialize these, but part of it is to get Ebisuya recycling into dumpsters?

1028
01:27:46,401 --> 01:27:47,122
Correct, yeah.

1029
01:27:47,202 --> 01:27:53,066
Right now they have a giant pile of boxes that they put out on Riverside Avenue that waste management picks up.

1030
01:27:54,386 --> 01:27:57,569
And it takes them like 15 minutes to get it into the packer truck.

1031
01:27:58,549 --> 01:28:04,833
So what the recommendation is, is for a 10-yard recycling dumpster to be put somewhere.

1032
01:28:05,254 --> 01:28:07,315
There is no somewhere on their private property.

1033
01:28:08,136 --> 01:28:12,339
So this is what they have been using or the building owner has been using for dumpsters.

1034
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:17,675
It seems to be working out okay.

1035
01:28:17,795 --> 01:28:29,484
We want to see if we can either consolidate those four into, maybe there's still four, but maybe there's also recycling in there as well, because I think those are trash.

1036
01:28:30,725 --> 01:28:35,328
They have residential there, although I understood the residents were moving out.

1037
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:39,171
They say they ought to be having recycling as well as trash.

1038
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:51,881
Yeah, I think to Alicia's point, it looks like it's too short to park head in like saying Alicia from what I could tell.

1039
01:28:51,901 --> 01:28:55,222
So maybe, I mean, it might've been built for dumpsters.

1040
01:28:55,262 --> 01:28:56,223
We, I just don't know.

1041
01:28:56,243 --> 01:28:57,223
There's no like history.

1042
01:28:57,263 --> 01:29:05,406
We'd have to go back in time and yeah, see losing zero spaces or if it was ever spaces, maybe two parallel.

1043
01:29:06,586 --> 01:29:11,108
I don't know if an aerial view might help, but can pull that up.

1044
01:29:13,332 --> 01:29:17,374
While you pull it up, I'm just going to take time to invite the public.

1045
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:23,096
If they have a comment, does anyone wish to speak to this petition for or against?

1046
01:29:23,296 --> 01:29:25,416
Just raise your hand, indicate.

1047
01:29:31,919 --> 01:29:40,782
Seeing none, the aerial view is up and we can see the issue as described by Director Blake.

1048
01:29:41,628 --> 01:29:48,402
Do other commissioners have questions or comments to Commissioner McGill?

1049
01:29:53,217 --> 01:30:00,522
Well, I'm in favor of getting our businesses into dumpsters and getting the trash off of our streets and the recycling off of our streets.

1050
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:07,427
And I am aware that there are some situations where the businesses literally do not have the space to do that on their own properties.

1051
01:30:08,508 --> 01:30:09,929
They weren't properly designed.

1052
01:30:10,249 --> 01:30:15,953
And this is one way we can collaborate to make that happen.

1053
01:30:17,194 --> 01:30:21,057
Design centers back then didn't always take into consideration solid waste removal.

1054
01:30:22,407 --> 01:30:29,593
So we're ending up in, you know, not a lot, but a handful of situations where we've got to get creative for the way we do things today.

1055
01:30:31,354 --> 01:30:32,615
This is one of those spots.

1056
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:44,625
Yeah, they don't have any property to do this, which I understand the language of the easement, and I'm happy to share with folks if folks want.

1057
01:30:46,072 --> 01:30:49,477
But basically, at some point, this land was deeded to the city.

1058
01:30:49,937 --> 01:30:58,869
It was part of that building lot to begin with, deeded to the city with the idea that a parking lot would be built, with the idea that clippership would be built.

1059
01:31:00,503 --> 01:31:08,467
And then what the agreement said was basically, we're not gonna, you know, we can guarantee you that we're not gonna remove these access type things to your building.

1060
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:21,174
So vehicular access around the building, the loading area that you saw, the operations of the buildings such as dumpsters, and this is the spot that they're in.

1061
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:26,356
But like I said, it happens to be on the side of the line that is deeded public land.

1062
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:28,818
Understood.

1063
01:31:29,441 --> 01:31:30,823
Commissioner, do you have a motion?

1064
01:31:30,843 --> 01:31:32,926
I would motion to approve.

1065
01:31:34,007 --> 01:31:40,696
And seconded would most likely have to be Commissioner Brzezinski since it's a petition of Commissioner McGiven.

1066
01:31:41,597 --> 01:31:41,997
Seconded.

1067
01:31:42,919 --> 01:31:44,360
Seconded by Commissioner Brzezinski.

1068
01:31:44,441 --> 01:31:46,123
Alba, can we get a roll call vote, please?

1069
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:47,404
Commissioner McGiven?

1070
01:31:47,953 --> 01:31:48,213
Yes.

1071
01:31:48,873 --> 01:31:49,654
Commissioner Hunt?

1072
01:31:50,074 --> 01:31:50,314
Yes.

1073
01:31:51,034 --> 01:31:52,154
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1074
01:31:52,555 --> 01:31:52,835
Yes.

1075
01:31:53,415 --> 01:31:54,115
Chief Buckley?

1076
01:31:54,135 --> 01:31:54,355
Yes.

1077
01:31:54,415 --> 01:31:59,037
On the vote of four to nothing, the petition is approved.

1078
01:31:59,057 --> 01:32:01,538
2025-18, no parking any time.

1079
01:32:01,878 --> 01:32:02,778
Yes, please.

1080
01:32:02,898 --> 01:32:16,943
If I may, I'll offer to bump my item back because I see Mr. Hartman and then Lisa Crossman have been waiting patiently, number 20 and number 59, but I can't make a motion because I'm not a member.

1081
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:30,275
If a commissioner will agree with Director Blake, I will move to... Happy to move this to the end to take the patiently waiting people first.

1082
01:32:30,335 --> 01:32:31,056
Will do.

1083
01:32:31,076 --> 01:32:36,058
2025-20 permit parking variance, Mr. Ryan Hartman, 72 Sharon Street.

1084
01:32:36,138 --> 01:32:42,120
Mr. Hartman, could you unmute yourself and present your petition?

1085
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,801
Welcome to the Traffic Commission.

1086
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:45,302
And thank you for your patience.

1087
01:32:46,779 --> 01:32:48,400
Hello, can you hear me?

1088
01:32:48,921 --> 01:32:50,982
Yes, we can hear you.

1089
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:52,163
Thank you for your time as well.

1090
01:32:53,845 --> 01:33:01,671
It's similar to the motion before mine where I have a commercial vehicle that I park on my street that I'm trying to get permission to park on.

1091
01:33:02,412 --> 01:33:04,754
I have accumulated multiple tickets for it.

1092
01:33:05,214 --> 01:33:08,817
It is a vehicle I use for work every day.

1093
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:13,381
I do not have a driveway at my location.

1094
01:33:15,253 --> 01:33:17,894
So I'm unable to park it off the street anywhere.

1095
01:33:19,255 --> 01:33:23,877
The other alternative I know of is the Walgreens parking lot down the street from me.

1096
01:33:24,517 --> 01:33:29,340
That costs some money to pay for, I think it's like $19 for five days or something.

1097
01:33:31,821 --> 01:33:35,703
I'm just trying to avoid continuously paying either parking tickets or parking for my vehicle.

1098
01:33:36,563 --> 01:33:40,145
As much as I don't even like having the thing, I do need it for work.

1099
01:33:51,997 --> 01:33:55,619
Can I confirm that you have a Nissan van?

1100
01:33:55,639 --> 01:34:00,181
It has commercial plates and it's registered out of New Hampshire?

1101
01:34:00,702 --> 01:34:01,162
Correct.

1102
01:34:04,604 --> 01:34:09,446
To the commission, we dealt with this issue earlier.

1103
01:34:09,626 --> 01:34:17,791
I'd just like to point out for folks that one minor difference from the last one is Sharon Street does not appear to be resident permit for whatever that's worth.

1104
01:34:18,711 --> 01:34:20,512
But it still has to negate the other issues, I guess.

1105
01:34:22,078 --> 01:34:26,462
Yeah, we're in a tough spot for things like this.

1106
01:34:26,482 --> 01:34:29,826
Yep, they seem to be growing a number.

1107
01:34:31,607 --> 01:34:33,549
Yeah, and I don't want to keep tabling them, so.

1108
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:41,978
I feel like we should talk to the City Council about whether we want to change the ordinance.

1109
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:44,740
I'd like to understand how other communities handle this.

1110
01:34:45,903 --> 01:34:48,265
Is this something I should go have an intern look into?

1111
01:34:48,325 --> 01:34:49,947
Is this thing Sarah knows about?

1112
01:34:51,248 --> 01:34:58,115
But my instinct here is that we need to deny this, but we ought to keep a list of who these people are.

1113
01:34:58,255 --> 01:35:02,820
And if we change the rules, we should let them know that the rules have changed.

1114
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,121
I understood.

1115
01:35:04,161 --> 01:35:06,143
You said a couple of things that intrigue me.

1116
01:35:06,523 --> 01:35:07,885
One, the first one is the answer.

1117
01:35:07,925 --> 01:35:08,986
We do keep track of these.

1118
01:35:11,722 --> 01:35:13,822
to reach out and contact with these petitioners.

1119
01:35:15,683 --> 01:35:19,163
Two, I do think we have to start doing some research on this matter.

1120
01:35:19,184 --> 01:35:29,626
And if you did have an intern, I, as chair, would love the opportunity to see what they could do to kind of research what other cities and towns are dealing with this.

1121
01:35:29,666 --> 01:35:35,667
This problem is, or this matter is not going away, and they seem to think it's only gonna grow.

1122
01:35:39,167 --> 01:35:41,229
Well, the numbers of petitions are going to be growing.

1123
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:42,831
We have an ordinance.

1124
01:35:42,871 --> 01:35:48,717
We can't really act well beyond that ordinance, barring, I guess, unusual circumstances.

1125
01:35:51,574 --> 01:36:02,904
Mister Hartman, if you understand what's happening, you were here earlier, I believe you've already indicated that you were and you saw that there's an ordinance that prevents commercial vehicles.

1126
01:36:02,984 --> 01:36:05,927
It limits what we can do here as a traffic commission.

1127
01:36:07,468 --> 01:36:16,937
But there's enough of these petitions cropping up that we are gonna start doing some research to see what we can do to help you out in the future.

1128
01:36:19,093 --> 01:36:25,517
If you want to add anything to that, I'll allow that now at this time, and then I'm going to go back to the commissioners to take a vote.

1129
01:36:25,597 --> 01:36:31,401
So the floor is yours if you want to add to this and throw anything out for us.

1130
01:36:38,285 --> 01:36:39,866
You need to unmute.

1131
01:36:39,886 --> 01:36:40,507
Oh, sorry.

1132
01:36:41,027 --> 01:36:42,408
I'll send that.

1133
01:36:43,449 --> 01:36:46,651
And part of, I think, what's helpful for us to understand is like,

1134
01:36:47,662 --> 01:36:54,766
how did you end up living in a place with no parking or where you're not allowed to park the vehicle overnight, but you live here?

1135
01:36:54,786 --> 01:36:57,607
Like if you had a driveway, that would be the solution.

1136
01:36:58,988 --> 01:36:59,908
Yes, it would be.

1137
01:37:01,089 --> 01:37:09,713
I initially lived, I lived in Medford for a few years now, and I used to be able to park in at the end of my street, because for some reason it was allowed at the end of that street.

1138
01:37:10,153 --> 01:37:13,035
That is now four or five blocks from my house.

1139
01:37:15,253 --> 01:37:18,397
I don't particularly want to walk a 20-minute, 30-minute walk every day.

1140
01:37:20,299 --> 01:37:24,444
It's more likely that we were enforcing the rules differently at the time, honestly.

1141
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:30,912
I can't imagine that there's any place in Medford where the rules are different, unless it was a private way?

1142
01:37:30,932 --> 01:37:33,254
No, it was a main street.

1143
01:37:33,294 --> 01:37:35,137
I just never seemed to have any issues there.

1144
01:37:36,938 --> 01:37:39,820
I'm not sure, maybe it was just different, but I never had a problem over there.

1145
01:37:40,481 --> 01:37:43,283
But now that I've moved, I do have a different issue, which is the car.

1146
01:37:43,683 --> 01:37:49,507
So it's a smaller vehicle than my last one, but it is still a commercial vehicle that I use for work.

1147
01:37:52,389 --> 01:37:54,171
Understood, and thank you.

1148
01:37:54,491 --> 01:38:02,757
Commissioners, I present the petition back to you for resolution.

1149
01:38:06,249 --> 01:38:10,152
motion to deny.

1150
01:38:10,252 --> 01:38:17,297
One thing I'll say, again, I hope as our city grows, Chief, I like your idea.

1151
01:38:17,998 --> 01:38:24,062
We just got to start letting the elected officials know that we're running into issues like this.

1152
01:38:26,695 --> 01:38:28,616
Unfortunately, I agree with Commissioner McGivern.

1153
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:35,238
I would vote to deny it, but I do want people to understand it's something that we're looking into to hopefully fix in the future.

1154
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:36,539
Yeah, we have to.

1155
01:38:37,659 --> 01:38:38,700
So with that, second.

1156
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:51,604
On the motion of Commissioner McGivern to deny petition 2025-20 for a parking variance to 72 Sharon Street, seconded by Commissioner Baczynski.

1157
01:38:51,724 --> 01:38:53,005
Albert, roll call vote, please.

1158
01:38:53,675 --> 01:38:54,635
Commissioner McGibbon?

1159
01:38:55,116 --> 01:38:55,476
Yes.

1160
01:38:55,956 --> 01:38:56,776
Commissioner Hunt?

1161
01:38:57,437 --> 01:38:57,757
Yes.

1162
01:38:58,197 --> 01:38:59,358
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1163
01:38:59,878 --> 01:39:00,198
Yes.

1164
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:01,699
Chief Buckley?

1165
01:39:02,259 --> 01:39:02,539
Yes.

1166
01:39:02,739 --> 01:39:08,401
On the vote of four to zero, the petition is denied for the reasons stated above.

1167
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:22,888
And I will add that we will start looking into this and make it known to the city council and Commissioner Hunt, I would appreciate any services you could provide by way of internship to do some research into this.

1168
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:28,143
Chief, if I could just address Alicia and the commissioners.

1169
01:39:29,044 --> 01:39:36,831
The reason for this law in 2002 was because of eight taxi cabs that were parking on LSF.

1170
01:39:38,172 --> 01:39:51,243
I feel that they were not looking at single cars, it was commercial, but yet it was a taxi company that was parking on LSF, and that was the reason for this ordinance.

1171
01:39:55,672 --> 01:40:19,278
I mean another thing to consider this particular one's also an out-of-state plate so if and when the council or this commission ever considered commercial overnight perhaps there's still somehow to get them garaged in Medford it might be a compromise of some sort because those other things complicate matters and I wanted to also I don't have

1172
01:40:19,987 --> 01:40:27,635
Jim's Commissioner on Parking Policy and Enforcement in front of me, that they may have already done some research on what other cities and towns do.

1173
01:40:27,815 --> 01:40:28,816
Jim, do you recall?

1174
01:40:29,657 --> 01:40:30,158
We did.

1175
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:39,107
We did the research for some of the surrounding communities, and we looked at Somerville and Cambridge, I believe, in regards to their commercial vehicle.

1176
01:40:40,276 --> 01:40:56,409
In addition, I think as Todd alluded to, the out-of-state plate issue with the Chapter 90 chief or something of that regard, in regards to if somebody lives in this community, it's an out-of-state plate, how is that handled in regards to the Chapter 90?

1177
01:40:56,489 --> 01:41:04,175
There's some other issue that might be in addition to just an ordinance that is in place in this regard.

1178
01:41:05,675 --> 01:41:18,466
understood and I think it's high time we do a little bit trying to do some research and investigate this come to some terms with we've been doing a lot of work on parking in the city we'll put the effort into this one also.

1179
01:41:21,703 --> 01:41:33,074
Based on the request of Commissioner Hunt, 2021-59 has been, last month we removed it from table items placed on this agenda.

1180
01:41:33,094 --> 01:41:38,338
2021-59, handicapped signs, West Bedford Community Center, Arlington Street.

1181
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:46,246
In September of 22, there was a request for two handicapped signs for the West Bedford Community Center.

1182
01:41:46,626 --> 01:41:54,032
the traffic commission approved one sign and we set up a review for six months for an additional side.

1183
01:41:54,092 --> 01:41:59,496
Well we will be on those six months and we've untabled it for discussion.

1184
01:42:01,057 --> 01:42:04,040
The petitioner was present earlier.

1185
01:42:06,241 --> 01:42:06,421
Ms.

1186
01:42:06,502 --> 01:42:08,063
Crossman is still available.

1187
01:42:08,123 --> 01:42:09,524
We will ask you to unmute.

1188
01:42:10,785 --> 01:42:15,969
I know that she has shared some emails and discussions with Director Blake

1189
01:42:20,150 --> 01:42:21,451
as well as Francis.

1190
01:42:22,091 --> 01:42:23,231
And Francis also.

1191
01:42:23,251 --> 01:42:25,272
So Ms.

1192
01:42:25,292 --> 01:42:37,858
Crossman, if you'd like to present the petition again, we understand that it was sent here for originally 2022, and then I will move to both Todd and Francis on this matter.

1193
01:42:38,018 --> 01:42:39,438
Welcome to the Traffic Commission.

1194
01:42:39,858 --> 01:42:40,439
Thank you.

1195
01:42:41,539 --> 01:42:46,301
So we are requesting that we move forward with the second space.

1196
01:42:47,582 --> 01:42:48,182
We have

1197
01:42:49,335 --> 01:42:54,499
The ride that comes to deliver folks to our activities.

1198
01:42:54,579 --> 01:43:03,985
So oftentimes the ride is dropping off in the space and another person with the placard is pulling up to park.

1199
01:43:05,727 --> 01:43:14,433
We have several folks that have the placard and are in need of it as people age or they have a fall or different issues.

1200
01:43:15,513 --> 01:43:18,355
And we'd like to have access

1201
01:43:20,276 --> 01:43:21,957
from the street to the door.

1202
01:43:21,977 --> 01:43:29,978
Yeah, we think it's time.

1203
01:43:30,119 --> 01:43:32,819
We have plenty of folks that would utilize the space.

1204
01:43:33,559 --> 01:43:44,402
We're challenged with folks who misuse the space and don't have a placard but are parking in the wrong direction, or they're a delivery driver and they're dropping off.

1205
01:43:45,642 --> 01:43:46,002
whatever.

1206
01:43:46,062 --> 01:43:53,009
So we would just like to secure those two spaces for the folks that need the access.

1207
01:43:53,609 --> 01:44:01,316
As we do more events, as we do more activities, that space becomes more in need.

1208
01:44:01,336 --> 01:44:03,138
Excellent.

1209
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:06,341
I think you have my concern as well.

1210
01:44:08,093 --> 01:44:14,788
that since we have instituted the one, there is still a need or an overwhelming need for an additional one.

1211
01:44:15,329 --> 01:44:17,153
I'm going to let you speak to that, but I think you already have.

1212
01:44:18,205 --> 01:44:26,688
Yeah, absolutely, because the first time around it was requested, I was first coming on to the organization, and that was post-pandemic.

1213
01:44:26,768 --> 01:44:28,969
Everything, it was so dead at the center.

1214
01:44:29,009 --> 01:44:30,390
Nothing was really happening.

1215
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:32,351
Nothing was in motion.

1216
01:44:33,031 --> 01:44:38,733
And now, flash forward three years later, we're doing events all the time, activities.

1217
01:44:39,153 --> 01:44:42,074
We have a more diverse group coming through the door.

1218
01:44:42,835 --> 01:44:45,996
We're working with the city health department in doing

1219
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:50,585
different health awareness activities and that's drawing different folks.

1220
01:44:50,825 --> 01:44:56,550
So as we do more rentals and things like that, we have more people who need that access.

1221
01:44:57,210 --> 01:44:59,992
And so, yes, we've ramped up since then.

1222
01:45:00,713 --> 01:45:08,520
Yeah, if I may, I just wanted to point out that the second one would still be within the, not that it has to be, but it would still be within the frontage of the community center.

1223
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:12,002
So it wouldn't be impacting in front of anyone else's house nearby.

1224
01:45:12,022 --> 01:45:13,764
And I'd also like to point out that

1225
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:18,884
It doesn't sometimes the question comes up, but there are other handicaps spaces in the area.

1226
01:45:18,924 --> 01:45:19,804
Would there be too many?

1227
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:23,207
It doesn't appear that there's any in the general vicinity besides this.

1228
01:45:23,267 --> 01:45:25,889
So, it doesn't seem like it would be too many for the 1 area.

1229
01:45:25,909 --> 01:45:29,912
And obviously, they'd be available for use by any of the.

1230
01:45:30,693 --> 01:45:35,957
Residents in the area, especially during non community center hours for someone to park overnight that may need it as well.

1231
01:45:37,659 --> 01:45:38,920
Probably go right here.

1232
01:45:41,053 --> 01:45:42,054
Thank you, Director Blake.

1233
01:45:42,754 --> 01:45:47,396
I know that Director Nwaje is also present.

1234
01:45:47,436 --> 01:45:49,557
Would you like to speak on the matter?

1235
01:45:50,737 --> 01:45:54,519
And if so, please unmute yourself and welcome to the Traffic Commission.

1236
01:45:59,206 --> 01:46:00,066
Thank you so much.

1237
01:46:00,307 --> 01:46:04,809
I'm just here to advocate for the second space to be put up as quickly as possible.

1238
01:46:05,489 --> 01:46:19,557
I think that one of the things that we sometimes don't always understand is that one party may be making a request, but that request is actually a benefit to an entire community.

1239
01:46:19,577 --> 01:46:27,561
I do stop by the community center on a regular basis and I observe and I notice

1240
01:46:28,401 --> 01:46:31,104
the demographics in that neighborhood.

1241
01:46:31,264 --> 01:46:37,729
Not necessarily all attending the community center per se, but just in that neighborhood.

1242
01:46:38,229 --> 01:46:47,437
I see those two spaces as a benefit to people who might need them and who would already qualify for them, which is not our jurisdiction.

1243
01:46:47,817 --> 01:46:49,939
They would already have received that placard.

1244
01:46:50,559 --> 01:46:54,462
I see those spaces as a benefit to helping people aged in place.

1245
01:46:56,083 --> 01:47:07,487
So, I look at it on a much broader level, a little saddened that 1 was given and it was come back for the 2nd 1, but I wasn't here for that.

1246
01:47:07,547 --> 01:47:08,867
So I can't speak to that.

1247
01:47:08,987 --> 01:47:12,088
However, I would like to see this move forward as quickly as possible.

1248
01:47:17,543 --> 01:47:20,504
you know, participation, Director Nwaje.

1249
01:47:20,584 --> 01:47:32,287
Commissioners, before I go to the public to see their input, do we have questions or concerns of either the current petitioner, Director Blake or Director Nwaje?

1250
01:47:36,728 --> 01:47:42,410
I just had one point that what we approved going on three years now, it was basically

1251
01:47:43,418 --> 01:47:45,485
To review, it's not like we denied it, right?

1252
01:47:45,505 --> 01:47:48,815
We just wanted to give them one and then see if they needed another one, correct?

1253
01:47:50,277 --> 01:47:58,482
The wording from what I saw stated, you could have one, and it was basically evaluate and see if you need the other one.

1254
01:47:58,602 --> 01:48:04,046
So when it comes to accessibility, there really is no evaluation.

1255
01:48:04,566 --> 01:48:10,090
Just by way of the person coming forward, that person is already presenting that they have a need.

1256
01:48:10,590 --> 01:48:16,194
Because how would you evaluate if you were not the one that has the needs?

1257
01:48:16,214 --> 01:48:17,195
Do you see what I'm saying?

1258
01:48:18,535 --> 01:48:38,287
So as we continue to have more people aging and aging that attend the community center, but people in that community that resides there that are aging, I feel like it's really time to either say we're gonna put the second space or say we're not able to put the second space.

1259
01:48:40,038 --> 01:48:41,319
I appreciate your comment.

1260
01:48:41,459 --> 01:48:46,722
The point I just wanted to make, I think we were evaluating whether that was the proper space for you.

1261
01:48:46,762 --> 01:48:50,744
I don't think there's anybody on the group who would deny it.

1262
01:48:50,924 --> 01:48:53,445
It was just basically, was there a better option for you?

1263
01:48:53,465 --> 01:49:00,489
But if the other handicapped spot is the better option, barring anything from the public or from my fellow commissioners, I would go ahead and approve this.

1264
01:49:00,849 --> 01:49:03,291
So I think that was the point I was trying to make.

1265
01:49:04,631 --> 01:49:06,152
Thank you, Commissioner Wisniewski.

1266
01:49:07,807 --> 01:49:08,728
to approve 2021 dash 59.

1267
01:49:08,788 --> 01:49:13,031
Handicap sign a second handicap sign for the West

1268
01:49:36,188 --> 01:49:37,129
Commissioner McGibbon?

1269
01:49:37,709 --> 01:49:37,970
Yes.

1270
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:39,231
Commissioner Hunt?

1271
01:49:39,611 --> 01:49:39,951
Yes.

1272
01:49:40,632 --> 01:49:41,793
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1273
01:49:41,813 --> 01:49:49,220
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1274
01:49:52,963 --> 01:49:53,744
Unmute.

1275
01:49:53,784 --> 01:49:54,605
Yes, sorry.

1276
01:49:55,797 --> 01:49:56,777
I appreciate your time.

1277
01:50:19,166 --> 01:50:20,166
Thank you.

1278
01:50:20,186 --> 01:50:27,352
2025-18, no parking anytime south side of Fulton Spring Road from Fulton Street, a distance of 50 feet east of Fulton Street.

1279
01:50:27,773 --> 01:50:31,816
Sergeant Rogers, Director Blake, who would like the floor first?

1280
01:50:35,887 --> 01:50:36,588
Sergeant.

1281
01:50:36,628 --> 01:50:48,898
Chief, we've received complaints in that this area that the school buses cannot make the turn off of Fulton onto Fulton Spring Road because of parents parking on the other side.

1282
01:50:49,438 --> 01:50:51,039
I take it waiting for their children.

1283
01:50:52,961 --> 01:51:01,768
I also went up on off school hours and residents of Fulton Street in this area where there is no parking on Fulton Street

1284
01:51:02,972 --> 01:51:04,493
are parking in the same area.

1285
01:51:05,133 --> 01:51:08,154
So I don't believe it's a school hour issue.

1286
01:51:08,554 --> 01:51:10,014
I believe it's a 24-7 hour issue.

1287
01:51:10,034 --> 01:51:18,878
Tara and I have come up with a plan where there'd be no parking on the south side of Fulton St.

1288
01:51:18,938 --> 01:51:21,939
Road from Fulton St.

1289
01:51:21,959 --> 01:51:22,199
50 feet.

1290
01:51:24,119 --> 01:51:24,560
Excellent.

1291
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,220
And Director Blake, I see you put that up.

1292
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:31,182
Could you just kind of explain to the commissioners

1293
01:51:34,347 --> 01:51:36,088
plan visually on your map?

1294
01:51:36,688 --> 01:51:41,371
Yeah, the thought is that 20 feet just doesn't cut it at this particular intersection.

1295
01:51:42,171 --> 01:51:55,479
Fulton Spring Road is kind of tight for parking on both sides and two-way traffic, but we want to be sensitive to parking elsewhere, and it's really just the throat at the intersection that appears to be the problem, not further down the block.

1296
01:51:56,379 --> 01:52:01,542
So we wanted to start with one side, 50 feet, and see if that

1297
01:52:02,215 --> 01:52:08,717
rectifies any issues clogging up this area, particularly during the schools, but during all times.

1298
01:52:09,197 --> 01:52:15,740
And then if this didn't remedy the situation, we'd come back and potentially modify it at a later date.

1299
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:18,020
But this is what we came up with at this time.

1300
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:19,921
I understand.

1301
01:52:19,981 --> 01:52:20,441
Thank you.

1302
01:52:21,042 --> 01:52:24,203
Commissioners, questions of Sergeant Rogers and Director Blake?

1303
01:52:27,364 --> 01:52:28,784
I'll ask my standard question.

1304
01:52:28,844 --> 01:52:30,845
Have we notified the abutting owners?

1305
01:52:33,348 --> 01:52:35,189
We don't have to.

1306
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:37,150
We don't have to.

1307
01:52:37,170 --> 01:52:40,872
It's a good question.

1308
01:52:41,332 --> 01:52:50,797
Just so the residents in this area or some of the parents in this area that are aware of the issue, the ones who contacted us, not necessarily the direct abutters.

1309
01:52:51,017 --> 01:52:56,179
There are really no houses here.

1310
01:52:56,599 --> 01:52:57,800
Director Blake, let me ask a question.

1311
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,642
The two corner houses there, are they residents of Fulton Spring or Fulton Street?

1312
01:53:02,632 --> 01:53:09,418
This one here looks like Fulton, and they do have a driveway up the page here, right here, this driveway.

1313
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:20,566
And this house does appear to be a resident of Fulton Spring, but they also appear to have two current residents.

1314
01:53:20,586 --> 01:53:29,714
Okay, and to both you and the sergeant, to answer Commissioner Brzezinski's question, the neighbors of those residents at a minimum haven't been notified on this.

1315
01:53:30,887 --> 01:53:34,788
I don't believe they need to be.

1316
01:53:34,988 --> 01:53:36,788
I support all these safety changes.

1317
01:53:36,968 --> 01:53:43,129
I just think as a courtesy, we should do a better job of notifying the people that are affected by this.

1318
01:53:43,429 --> 01:53:44,870
If nothing else, tell them we're doing it.

1319
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:45,790
It's a safety issue.

1320
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:46,870
We hope you'll understand.

1321
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:51,311
But I just don't like our habit as a city of not notifying people of things.

1322
01:53:51,431 --> 01:53:51,831
That's all.

1323
01:53:53,031 --> 01:53:53,551
Understood.

1324
01:53:53,571 --> 01:53:58,132
Commissioner Hunt, Commissioner McGiven, questions, comments?

1325
01:53:59,137 --> 01:53:59,997
I'm glad we're doing this.

1326
01:54:00,778 --> 01:54:14,585
It was kind of like on my radar as far as fixing this issue because I used to live up here and it's not just school buses, it's landscaping trucks, it's a garbage truck every now and then.

1327
01:54:16,451 --> 01:54:17,632
And I think this is a good first step.

1328
01:54:18,273 --> 01:54:22,698
I was even thinking, you know, expanding it and making it parking just on one side.

1329
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:28,285
But I think this is a good incremental step to see if this solves some of the issues up there.

1330
01:54:28,365 --> 01:54:29,206
So I'm in favor of it.

1331
01:54:29,226 --> 01:54:33,170
Seems like a reasonable safety thing to me.

1332
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:37,631
go to the public.

1333
01:54:37,691 --> 01:54:38,853
I don't know who's left here.

1334
01:54:39,253 --> 01:54:42,617
Anyone in the public wish to speak for or against this petition?

1335
01:54:42,637 --> 01:54:45,621
I can't even see who we have left here.

1336
01:54:45,641 --> 01:54:47,423
It's just Mr. Viola hanging out.

1337
01:54:47,443 --> 01:54:52,529
Mr. Viola's riveted by our actions here.

1338
01:54:54,105 --> 01:55:00,931
Okay, seeing none from the public, I send it back to the commissioners for a vote.

1339
01:55:01,191 --> 01:55:16,945
From the chair, I would suggest that however this petition falls out, I would recommend that my sergeant, traffic sergeant and director Blake, do some outreach to the naval with regard, whether it passes or doesn't pass in this.

1340
01:55:19,658 --> 01:55:48,295
to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve the motion to approve 
the motion

1341
01:55:49,458 --> 01:55:50,658
unless I got those all wrong.

1342
01:55:50,778 --> 01:55:51,879
Alva, vote, roll call vote.

1343
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:53,699
Commissioner McGibbon?

1344
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:54,520
Yes.

1345
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:55,960
Commissioner Hunt?

1346
01:55:56,641 --> 01:55:56,881
Yes.

1347
01:55:57,541 --> 01:55:58,721
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1348
01:55:59,181 --> 01:55:59,461
Yes.

1349
01:56:00,522 --> 01:56:01,402
Chief Buckley?

1350
01:56:01,482 --> 01:56:01,742
Yes.

1351
01:56:01,822 --> 01:56:05,023
On the vote of Ford and Upton, the petition has been approved.

1352
01:56:06,344 --> 01:56:10,405
Skipping ahead, 2025-21, crosswalk daylighting.

1353
01:56:10,945 --> 01:56:13,166
First one, High Street opposite Boynton Road.

1354
01:56:13,246 --> 01:56:15,427
Second one, High Street opposite Potterhouse Road.

1355
01:56:15,447 --> 01:56:18,188
Director Blake, the petition and floor are yours.

1356
01:56:24,761 --> 01:56:26,782
Sorry, I'm just trying to pull up a graphic here.

1357
01:56:27,122 --> 01:56:37,186
Chief, if you'd like to remind the commissioners that we had a child hit at this location two weeks ago.

1358
01:56:39,027 --> 01:56:44,749
Yeah, luckily it was no injury, but it just highlights the fact that we need to circle back.

1359
01:56:44,769 --> 01:56:47,670
We've been doing it kind of piecemeal, and this one's near a school.

1360
01:56:48,397 --> 01:56:52,338
So we're trying to restrict parking ahead of a crosswalk.

1361
01:56:53,258 --> 01:57:00,260
So prior to a crosswalk coming from Winthrop Circle towards Medford Square, this is in the vicinity of the school.

1362
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:03,961
So it's next to the gymnasium there opposite Boynton Road.

1363
01:57:04,261 --> 01:57:05,681
This is probably a better view.

1364
01:57:05,701 --> 01:57:10,262
So there's a crosswalk here right at the end of the gymnasium.

1365
01:57:10,722 --> 01:57:14,463
When people park right up to this crosswalk, it really impacts the sightline.

1366
01:57:15,969 --> 01:57:17,990
Um, so we want restricted.

1367
01:57:18,650 --> 01:57:24,573
Tim will appreciate this to this existing pool here and swap out the sign with different science and no new pool.

1368
01:57:25,914 --> 01:57:31,276
Um, and then we have hatched it, although it was raining that day.

1369
01:57:31,336 --> 01:57:37,339
So we'll see if it lasts, but the paint and we've had put cones there as well to try to really highlight that.

1370
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:43,082
Um, DPW graciously also installed led flashing signs already.

1371
01:57:44,234 --> 01:57:47,776
So we're just trying to do our best to improve these crosswalks wherever we can.

1372
01:57:47,796 --> 01:57:51,739
And the second one that's listed on the same item is also near St.

1373
01:57:51,779 --> 01:57:54,681
Joseph's School on High Street, opposite Powder House.

1374
01:57:54,701 --> 01:57:55,781
This is Powder House here.

1375
01:57:55,801 --> 01:58:00,204
There's a driveway before the crosswalk, but we need a little more than that.

1376
01:58:01,005 --> 01:58:05,227
And that will be on an existing pole, so not a new channel either, a light pole.

1377
01:58:06,328 --> 01:58:07,389
So this light pole here.

1378
01:58:07,409 --> 01:58:10,971
So it's about a half a parking space and then a driveway.

1379
01:58:12,447 --> 01:58:12,728
What's that?

1380
01:58:13,448 --> 01:58:13,989
You're on a roll.

1381
01:58:14,489 --> 01:58:15,910
Yeah, that's cool.

1382
01:58:17,411 --> 01:58:21,674
So that's the request, daylight, these two crosswalks.

1383
01:58:24,015 --> 01:58:31,100
The other direction, there's a street on Boynton and there's a bus stop already, so it's really only the eastbound direction that we're looking for.

1384
01:58:35,448 --> 01:58:36,369
Thank you, Director Blake.

1385
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:41,812
Commissioners, questions or concerns related to the petition?

1386
01:58:47,216 --> 01:58:52,199
I have a question about the striping of the crosswalks.

1387
01:58:52,279 --> 01:58:54,981
Is that something that will happen automatically?

1388
01:58:55,241 --> 01:58:56,842
Are we waiting for something?

1389
01:58:57,182 --> 01:59:00,725
I mean, I don't know if the picture is accurate today, but they look faded.

1390
01:59:03,794 --> 01:59:08,457
Yeah, when the weather turns in the spring, we usually do a round of paint.

1391
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:16,343
So whatever is faded now, it just won't, temperature and wet weather, rain or snow, it just won't adhere.

1392
01:59:16,423 --> 01:59:20,666
So we usually try to do it spring, summer, fall.

1393
01:59:21,747 --> 01:59:23,689
This one in particular looks very faded, yes.

1394
01:59:24,729 --> 01:59:32,075
But we have, if you drive out there, I have other photos where the LED signs really make the crosswalk pop up too.

1395
01:59:34,197 --> 01:59:35,238
They were quick.

1396
01:59:35,438 --> 01:59:40,343
So those ones, I think, we do once a year, the ones on High Street.

1397
01:59:42,465 --> 01:59:44,467
So the answer is yes, they automatically get done.

1398
01:59:45,488 --> 01:59:45,688
Yeah.

1399
01:59:46,208 --> 01:59:48,951
And then one last question, how many parking spots are being lost?

1400
01:59:49,892 --> 01:59:50,112
Any?

1401
01:59:51,153 --> 01:59:58,380
It looks like one and a half at the Boynton location and then a half of space at opposite parts.

1402
02:00:00,977 --> 02:00:03,278
And just for the record, I'll ask my standard question.

1403
02:00:03,318 --> 02:00:05,878
Did we notify the abutting homeowners of what we're doing?

1404
02:00:05,898 --> 02:00:22,863
In this particular case, we did not notify this apartment building with a half space, but the school is aware because the folks running some of those programs, the young girl was walking towards a basketball practice.

1405
02:00:22,964 --> 02:00:27,805
So it was the parents of the school as well as some of the administration of the school that asked for it.

1406
02:00:28,706 --> 02:00:28,946
Yeah.

1407
02:00:29,366 --> 02:00:32,788
So it would really impact them the most, that one-and-a-half space.

1408
02:00:34,129 --> 02:00:35,010
I live in that area.

1409
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:42,814
I live on Grandview, and that's a poorly lit area, particularly at night, and the kids just dart all over the place.

1410
02:00:44,235 --> 02:00:53,721
Again, to reiterate my point on the last, I encourage us to continue to notify the people affected by this, but the safety issues, I'm all for it.

1411
02:00:53,801 --> 02:00:57,223
So when we're done with discussion, I'd be happy to put a motion forward.

1412
02:00:58,418 --> 02:01:03,922
Steve, your point about the lighting too, we did check all the street lights.

1413
02:01:06,244 --> 02:01:12,068
We checked the street lights in the area to see if they were working properly and at the highest illumination, so that was a good point, Steve.

1414
02:01:13,950 --> 02:01:15,211
Commissioner Hunt, comments and questions?

1415
02:01:16,772 --> 02:01:19,234
I mean, it seems like a safety thing to me, so.

1416
02:01:19,254 --> 02:01:23,517
Okay, let me go to the public, since we still do have a number.

1417
02:01:23,537 --> 02:01:26,419
Does anyone in the public wish to speak for or against the petition?

1418
02:01:30,484 --> 02:01:35,285
Seeing none, I send it back to the commissioners for a resolution.

1419
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:46,967
Commissioner Brzezinski was about to make a motion, but delayed.

1420
02:01:48,408 --> 02:01:51,288
Presuming no other comments from the other commissioners, motion to approve.

1421
02:01:52,208 --> 02:01:55,489
On the motion of Commissioner Brzezinski.

1422
02:01:56,029 --> 02:01:59,490
And one point of clarification on both, if we need to approve both.

1423
02:02:00,865 --> 02:02:01,305
Understood.

1424
02:02:01,405 --> 02:02:11,788
Okay, on the motion of Commissioner Brzezinski to approve 2025-21 crosswalk daylight for both one High Street opposite Point Road and two High Street opposite Potterhouse Road.

1425
02:02:12,448 --> 02:02:13,208
Seconded by?

1426
02:02:13,228 --> 02:02:15,849
Black History Month.

1427
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:18,610
The first is by Andrea Campbell.

1428
02:02:18,690 --> 02:02:20,370
Seconded by Commissioner McGibbon.

1429
02:02:21,491 --> 02:02:22,331
Alva, roll call roll.

1430
02:02:23,011 --> 02:02:23,951
Commissioner McGibbon?

1431
02:02:24,531 --> 02:02:25,292
Yes.

1432
02:02:25,312 --> 02:02:26,072
Commissioner Hunt?

1433
02:02:26,632 --> 02:02:26,932
Yes.

1434
02:02:27,532 --> 02:02:28,693
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1435
02:02:29,373 --> 02:02:29,593
Yes.

1436
02:02:30,416 --> 02:02:31,077
Chief Buckley.

1437
02:02:31,177 --> 02:02:34,520
Yes, on the vote of 4-0, the petition is approved.

1438
02:02:36,902 --> 02:02:37,402
Thank you.

1439
02:02:37,442 --> 02:02:43,688
The Mayor and Councilor Scarpelli had requested that we do something in that regard, so it will be appreciated.

1440
02:02:43,708 --> 02:02:43,908
Thank you.

1441
02:02:44,948 --> 02:02:46,028
Thank you, Director Blake.

1442
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:52,510
To the two final items, I'm making sure I didn't miss anything with the jumping rocks.

1443
02:02:52,590 --> 02:02:58,551
The two final items on the business tonight were our tabled items that we brought forth to the agenda.

1444
02:02:58,731 --> 02:03:05,853
I will start with 2023-47, no left turn, Emerson Street to Main Street.

1445
02:03:06,193 --> 02:03:12,295
This was voted on February 13th, 2024th meeting for a three-month review.

1446
02:03:14,128 --> 02:03:16,770
For those of you unaware, Director Blake, if you could pull this up.

1447
02:03:18,932 --> 02:03:29,340
My guess is that as a result of a lot of the work that we've done at the South Street, Main and South Street intersection, Emerson Street became a larger cutthroat and we were seeing an increase of traffic accidents.

1448
02:03:30,941 --> 02:03:35,184
The Traffic Commission had put up a no left turn and put some barriers across there.

1449
02:03:35,685 --> 02:03:41,049
And to this point, I think we've seen a high success rate of very few, if not

1450
02:03:41,693 --> 02:03:44,734
Did we have one accident, I think, someone, the research did since this time?

1451
02:03:44,934 --> 02:03:45,774
Yes, Sargent.

1452
02:03:47,175 --> 02:03:48,195
I believe it was one.

1453
02:03:51,576 --> 02:03:53,676
And there were several that were.

1454
02:03:53,696 --> 02:03:56,057
Before the change, there were several, right?

1455
02:03:56,837 --> 02:03:57,978
Yes.

1456
02:03:58,558 --> 02:03:58,978
Yeah, one.

1457
02:03:59,258 --> 02:04:02,619
So this petition is brought forth for the three-month review.

1458
02:04:09,310 --> 02:04:20,337
So I don't know if any of the commissioners have questions of either Sergeant Rogers, Director Boyko, or myself as to how it has been working out.

1459
02:04:22,398 --> 02:04:25,600
I just have a question about is this is what we've put up?

1460
02:04:26,501 --> 02:04:32,684
I know there's supposed to be a redesign of this area long term, but are we going to leave in place these pylons?

1461
02:04:33,185 --> 02:04:35,906
Is that the end result?

1462
02:04:35,966 --> 02:04:36,947
Are we going to extend the

1463
02:04:38,264 --> 02:04:42,047
The curve in the middle or the whatever that is, the flower bed.

1464
02:04:43,068 --> 02:05:00,745
I haven't discussed it with Tim, but I would suggest we leave these in place until the mass DOT long-term plan comes into place, because then we wouldn't spend city money to do something that we know is coming up by a different entity.

1465
02:05:00,785 --> 02:05:01,325
Discussed.

1466
02:05:01,505 --> 02:05:01,866
I agree.

1467
02:05:04,362 --> 02:05:05,003
have a motion to approve.

1468
02:05:05,023 --> 02:05:06,784
Yeah, just more of a point of clarification.

1469
02:05:06,844 --> 02:05:08,925
But I mean, no other comments from my colleagues.

1470
02:05:09,025 --> 02:05:10,106
I motion to approve.

1471
02:05:10,126 --> 02:05:15,870
Okay Uh, the most of Commissioner Brzezinski to approve 2023-47.

1472
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:22,615
No left turn ever the street to Main Street after it's three months for fuel to make permanent.

1473
02:05:23,075 --> 02:05:24,216
Do I have a second by the

1474
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:32,771
Commissioner McGiven?

1475
02:05:32,791 --> 02:05:33,711
Yes.

1476
02:05:34,371 --> 02:05:35,112
Commissioner Hunt?

1477
02:05:35,132 --> 02:05:36,092
Yes.

1478
02:05:36,733 --> 02:05:37,873
Commissioner Brzezinski?

1479
02:05:38,434 --> 02:05:38,774
Yes.

1480
02:05:39,434 --> 02:05:40,135
Chief Buckley?

1481
02:05:40,235 --> 02:05:43,417
Yes, on a vote of four nothing, the petition is approved.

1482
02:05:44,077 --> 02:05:49,640
In the same fashion, we have 2024-37, the G-Zone only six-month pilot review.

1483
02:05:50,501 --> 02:05:55,544
This Traffic Commission has voted in the G-Zones six months ago.

1484
02:05:55,664 --> 02:05:58,465
It is set for review in the January 2020 fifth meeting.

1485
02:05:58,525 --> 02:06:00,487
We have now put it to the February meeting.

1486
02:06:02,329 --> 02:06:04,630
I will start by reporting back.

1487
02:06:04,690 --> 02:06:06,932
I think part of the pilot approval was the response

1488
02:06:19,214 --> 02:06:24,618
Subsequent to the pilot beginning, there have been two reports of issues.

1489
02:06:25,459 --> 02:06:32,444
One of them was regarding the two-day and four-day pass program in the G zone and an explanation of that.

1490
02:06:33,425 --> 02:06:43,112
And the additional one was a Dexter Street resident who was concerned because they had been receiving tickets because of the 48 hours they were

1491
02:06:45,277 --> 02:06:49,580
going beyond the 48-hour process, they happen to be in the G Zone.

1492
02:06:50,181 --> 02:06:52,982
Both of them have subsequently been responded to.

1493
02:06:54,303 --> 02:07:02,189
As far as the traffic at Medford Police Department, there have been zero reports of the G Zone, according to Sergeant Canava.

1494
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:10,215
The parking department also has had zero reports of any issue with the G-Zone.

1495
02:07:11,336 --> 02:07:16,459
We had set up a C-click fix for G-Zone reporting or issues.

1496
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,441
There is zero there as well.

1497
02:07:19,422 --> 02:07:26,127
So it was a very limited amount of feedback that we had, and most of it had been clarification.

1498
02:07:27,563 --> 02:07:39,385
We have, I have submitted to you all some of the numbers for the LPR visits and ticketing over a six-month process for our focus streets.

1499
02:07:40,726 --> 02:07:43,746
We have a little bit of a addition to that.

1500
02:07:44,346 --> 02:07:53,568
The LPR technology is just used by the parking department and not the police department to rules that they have in place moved out to privacy, et cetera.

1501
02:07:54,442 --> 02:08:01,688
So the numbers that we have is, for the LPRs, over 2,000 visits to the G Zone itself and 749 tickets written by the LPR technology.

1502
02:08:01,748 --> 02:08:03,950
Subsequent to that, we seem to have additional

1503
02:08:15,030 --> 02:08:21,499
tickets that were issued on Alfred Street, a total of 37, Bow Street, a total of 317, Neal Street, 354, Marion Street, 108, Stanley, 93,

1504
02:08:33,436 --> 02:08:37,660
Birgit Av, 94, and Stearns, 25.

1505
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:50,071
So over a six-month period, the enforcement has been there, either in the LPR technology, also the foot patrol, more managing them differently.

1506
02:08:50,372 --> 02:08:51,793
I don't know the number of visits.

1507
02:08:51,933 --> 02:08:58,319
That's not part of writing the tickets, but we can assume that that visit number grows dramatically.

1508
02:08:59,607 --> 02:09:01,209
I think that's a good point.

1509
02:09:01,229 --> 02:09:01,590
Thank you.

1510
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:02,030
Thank you.

1511
02:09:12,233 --> 02:09:21,017
push out the parking problem versus variances are limited to that specific street and encumbers people who live on that street.

1512
02:09:21,498 --> 02:09:25,380
This sort of gives a little bit of equity for folks.

1513
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:28,101
We're not telling people to park on one location.

1514
02:09:28,161 --> 02:09:32,863
We're actually giving them an option to park on multiple locations in an area.

1515
02:09:33,824 --> 02:09:35,805
So the feedback has been

1516
02:09:36,870 --> 02:09:39,731
positive from conversation, from reporting.

1517
02:09:40,031 --> 02:09:47,853
People just generally do not report good issues with the mayor's office or parking, et cetera.

1518
02:09:48,333 --> 02:09:57,375
But from just conversations informally with people, it seems to be something that folks are a little bit happy about going forward.

1519
02:09:57,775 --> 02:10:04,677
In addition, because of the G zone, some of our main streets, Boston Avenue, Winchester Street, Harvard Street,

1520
02:10:05,541 --> 02:10:14,528
and also have become resident parking streets helping folks in those communities, in those areas.

1521
02:10:14,548 --> 02:10:14,889
Excellent.

1522
02:10:14,909 --> 02:10:16,490
Thank you for that presentation.

1523
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:18,812
Commissioners, questions of Mr. Silva?

1524
02:10:27,899 --> 02:10:30,081
I don't think it's working the way it should be.

1525
02:10:34,333 --> 02:10:35,854
I appreciate your presentation.

1526
02:10:36,174 --> 02:10:39,137
I think I'm probably the one who asked for the six-month review or pushed it.

1527
02:10:39,177 --> 02:10:43,200
I appreciate the information and I appreciate your presentation.

1528
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:43,540
Thank you.

1529
02:11:01,870 --> 02:11:07,252
I'm sorry I'm seeing no public participation.

1530
02:11:07,552 --> 02:11:09,212
Director McDermott the floor is yours.

1531
02:11:10,513 --> 02:11:26,918
So just to be clear going forward I am I a member of the public in these meetings or that's why I always wait for that that the request for the public because I know I'm not on the Commission so I feel like that's my role here but anybody else wants to talk first that's fine.

1532
02:11:27,518 --> 02:11:29,419
You are like

1533
02:11:36,979 --> 02:11:40,525
that we need to depend on to address some of our issues.

1534
02:11:40,605 --> 02:11:44,070
So if you have anything, you can either wave or interject.

1535
02:11:44,971 --> 02:11:46,454
Director Blake will show you how to do that.

1536
02:11:49,478 --> 02:11:56,081
I think the chair missed asking you first before the public sometimes.

1537
02:11:56,341 --> 02:11:56,841
It's okay.

1538
02:11:58,042 --> 02:12:05,185
It's really just a recent thing that we noticed that is a benefit of the zoned parking.

1539
02:12:05,345 --> 02:12:16,570
I met with Owen in engineering about, and we talked about this a little bit earlier in the parking implementation team meeting, about when

1540
02:12:17,590 --> 02:12:30,507
engineering issues an on-street permit for construction and that street is permitted, then the residents of that street are displaced and communicating where they can then park.

1541
02:12:30,648 --> 02:12:31,789
So if they're parked on

1542
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:48,621
If they usually park on one street and a big chunk of that street is given away for construction to occur, then the communication to the public as to where they should then park is not always clear, and it's hard to communicate to them.

1543
02:12:49,321 --> 02:12:54,205
In a zoned parking situation, that negates that issue.

1544
02:12:54,585 --> 02:13:06,493
If somebody in the G-Zone, Winchester Street, a big chunk of it, a few blocks is taken up with construction, then they can park anywhere else in the G-Zone and it's not going to get them a ticket.

1545
02:13:06,973 --> 02:13:14,859
We don't have to worry about giving them or you have to park on this street because then inevitably somebody is going to say, I don't want that street, I want this street.

1546
02:13:16,695 --> 02:13:29,388
The zone parking negates that issue for the most part and makes displacing people from one street a lot less of a burden on the citizen.

1547
02:13:43,944 --> 02:13:44,645
I have nothing more.

1548
02:13:44,665 --> 02:13:46,866
But again, Jim, thank you for the presentations.

1549
02:13:48,407 --> 02:13:49,987
I'm glad that it's working out.

1550
02:13:53,429 --> 02:14:01,193
Do we have lots of residents who live on these streets who are complaining and telling us that it's horrible and they wish we would take it away?

1551
02:14:01,213 --> 02:14:05,235
Not for the police department.

1552
02:14:05,255 --> 02:14:05,696
Great.

1553
02:14:06,876 --> 02:14:07,997
Not for the mayor's office.

1554
02:14:08,774 --> 02:14:16,360
And those residents, and they may not know we're discussing it tonight, but they knew that we said it was a pilot and we would evaluate.

1555
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:18,801
And in fact, we've taken a long time for it.

1556
02:14:18,841 --> 02:14:22,985
We've given them extra time to tell us if there were problems.

1557
02:14:23,005 --> 02:14:26,767
So that's good.

1558
02:14:26,787 --> 02:14:30,810
So we have to take a vote.

1559
02:14:31,171 --> 02:14:32,512
We do.

1560
02:14:32,812 --> 02:14:34,293
Move to approve it as permanent.

1561
02:14:35,143 --> 02:14:46,526
Okay, on the motion of Commissioner Hunt to approve 2024-37 to make the G-Zone program a permanent part of the city of Memphis parking practice.

1562
02:14:47,087 --> 02:14:53,509
Motion by Commissioner Hunt, seconded by... The letter that was written by... Commissioner McGiven?

1563
02:14:53,869 --> 02:14:54,289
Yup.

1564
02:14:54,689 --> 02:14:57,010
You're fading, but we're almost done.

I'm happy to state that we got through three more table items moving forward.

1587
02:15:36,557 --> 02:15:39,158
I would like to have maybe Sgt.

1588
02:15:39,318 --> 02:15:41,900
Rogers, Director Blake, Sgt.

1589
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:45,462
Canava take a look at any of these other table items that we could present for you.

1590
02:15:55,539 --> 02:15:57,060
to be able to get through it.

1591
02:15:57,860 --> 02:16:07,525
With that, I will accept a motion to adjourn, and I thank you all, as usual, for your participation and your assistance in this matter.

1592
02:16:08,225 --> 02:16:10,586
Motion.

1593
02:16:10,606 --> 02:16:12,407
Director Blake, did you have a comment?

1594
02:16:12,427 --> 02:16:14,929
Mr. Vail, is that what you were waiting for all this time?

1595
02:16:15,329 --> 02:16:16,589
Just make sure.

1596
02:16:18,350 --> 02:16:20,111
Oh, he can't unmute himself here.

1597
02:16:20,131 --> 02:16:21,352
He's friendly.

1598
02:16:22,262 --> 02:16:31,588
I wanted to hear a little bit more about the zone parking and I think it's been working wonderfully to be honest with you.

1599
02:16:31,608 --> 02:16:33,770
So, and let me say, it's another thing.

1600
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:37,192
It's great to have the parking clerk attending the meetings too.

1601
02:16:37,252 --> 02:16:39,894
I think that's going to be a benefit for everybody.

1602
02:16:39,934 --> 02:16:40,034
So.

1603
02:16:40,574 --> 02:16:43,235
And thank you all for tonight, I appreciate it.

1604
02:16:43,255 --> 02:16:43,756
Take care.

1605
02:16:43,796 --> 02:16:47,918
We do see the advantage in the pocket, Clark, and I appreciate your advocacy.

1606
02:16:47,938 --> 02:16:49,979
Director.

1607
02:16:50,779 --> 02:16:51,740

And thank you, Mrs. Erickson.

1609
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:54,081
I don't get to say anything.

1610
02:16:54,141 --> 02:16:54,701
I don't mind.

1611
02:16:54,821 --> 02:16:55,842
My clerks work hard.

1612
02:16:55,962 --> 02:16:57,763
I don't mind being compared to my clerks.

1613
02:16:58,443 --> 02:16:59,884
It's late.

1614
02:16:59,984 --> 02:17:00,644
It's quite all right.

1615
02:17:01,084 --> 02:17:02,385
Several hours.

1616
02:17:02,705 --> 02:17:05,266
With that, a motion to adjourn.

1617
02:17:05,306 --> 02:17:06,387
