1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:01,872
From my fellow school committee members.

2
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:03,972
Perfect.

3
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:08,714
Aloha.

4
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:11,295
Hi, Susie.

5
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:21,898
From my fellow school committee members.

6
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:23,279
Perfect.

7
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,302
You got me today, Paulette.

8
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:42,842
Say that again, Paul?

9
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:44,143
You got me.

10
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:46,523
Yep, I saw you and now I see Jenny.

11
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:52,284
So with the three of us here, I'm gonna go ahead and start the meeting.

12
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,005
If we could all rise to say the Pledge of Allegiance.

13
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:08,687
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

14
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:10,755
Thank you.

15
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:13,076
I'm gonna take the roll.

16
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:14,676
Member Graham?

17
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:17,617
Here.

18
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:29,421
Member McStone is unable to attend, but Member Russo is attending in her absence.

19
00:01:30,422 --> 00:01:30,822
I'm here.

20
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:32,202
Thank you.

21
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:36,724
And now I'm going to

22
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,181
Read the paragraph.

23
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:42,543
You would think at this point, we really should have taped it or something.

24
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:48,108
We should have thought about something more clever, but I don't think any of us ever perceived we'd be reading it this long.

25
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:52,291
Anyway, meeting date, May 31st, 5 to no later than 6.30.

26
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:55,893
Please be advised.

27
00:01:56,953 --> 00:02:00,655
On 5-3, from 5 to 6-30, there will be a curriculum subcommittee.

28
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:07,178
The purpose of this meeting is to review the health education and physical education curricula in the Medford public schools.

29
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:12,961
Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law,

30
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:19,366
and the Governor's March 15, 2020 order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place.

The meeting ID is 93008727811.

40
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:22,758
OneTap Mobile is 19292056099.

41
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:23,078
Okay.

42
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:39,631
And having said all of that, the agenda is we will review the health education and physical education curricula.

43
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:47,255
And with us today is the director of physical education and health education and assistant athletic director.

44
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:49,936
That's a long title, Rachel, but Rachel Perry.

45
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:54,318
So Rachel, I know that you have a presentation for us.

46
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:57,740
Which area are we going to discuss first?

47
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,621
We're gonna start with health education.

48
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:00,241
Okay.

49
00:04:01,336 --> 00:04:02,736
So can I turn it over to you now?

50
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:03,376
Sure.

51
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:04,697
I just need to be able to share my screen.

52
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:09,378
You should be good to go.

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,860
Nope.

54
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:26,841
Try it again.

55
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:52,502
No, it's not allowing me to.

56
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:52,562
Oh.

57
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:00,209
Up there goes possibly.

58
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:12,549
And for some reason, it's not coming up.

59
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:13,750
Peter, can you do it from there?

60
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:20,376
If you share the presentation with me, I can definitely do it.

61
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:21,858
OK, one second.

62
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:09,893
There we go.

63
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:15,376
All right, there we go.

64
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:16,997
You should be getting it.

65
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:44,098
share screen.

66
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:02,489
Is it showing or no?

67
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,290
No.

68
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:06,731
It was just up.

69
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:16,199
To member Van de Kloot's point, you think 14 months in, we'd be through our technical difficulties.

70
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:21,103
There we go.

71
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:21,623
We got it.

72
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:22,864
Awesome.

73
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:24,025
Thank you so much.

74
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:24,746
Problem.

75
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:25,887
All right.

76
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:30,590
So I'll just talk a little bit about the presentation topics first, then we'll dive right in.

77
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:34,073
First, we're going to talk a little bit about the MAS frameworks.

78
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:38,837
We'll move on to national health education and physical education standards.

79
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:53,060
And then we'll go into the elementary, middle and high school health curriculum and the physical education curriculum, talk a little bit about professional development and then moving forward 2021 and beyond.

80
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:54,801
Moving to the next slide.

81
00:07:57,984 --> 00:07:58,945
And next one.

82
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,147
Thank you.

83
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:07,872
So I'm gonna talk a little bit about our program description and then we'll talk about the frameworks.

84
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:25,280
The goal of the Physical Education and Health Education Department of Medford Public Schools is to enhance the well-being of the school community by creating a culture that integrates and balances the six dimensions of wellness, social, physical, intellectual, occupational, emotional, and spiritual.

85
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:33,225
The department strives to encourage an active, healthy lifestyle, healthy decision-making, and a lifelong commitment to wellness.

86
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:40,316
The Massachusetts state health education and physical education frameworks were last updated in 1999.

87
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:54,367
Since these frameworks are not up to date, Medford Public Schools health education and physical education curriculum are aligned to the physical education, health education, and sexual education national standards.

88
00:08:55,708 --> 00:09:00,772
Medford Public Schools health curriculum is based on the seven health education skills.

89
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:13,203
analyzing influences, accessing information, interpersonal communication, decision-making, goal-setting, practicing health-enhancing behaviors, and advocacy.

90
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:18,307
We will revise our curricula to follow updated standards as they are released.

91
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:22,590
You will find links to the state and national standards at the bottom of the slide.

92
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:30,777
Right now, from what I understand, the Department of Education is doing an update and an edit

93
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,503
to the frameworks, and then that's going to be put out for public opinion.

94
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:38,905
Then they'll do another edit from there, and then they will be released.

95
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:47,931
I don't know how long those will take, but once we get them, I will unpack them with my staff, and then we'll have to align what we're doing to those standards.

96
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:55,336
Then I imagine I'll be coming before you all again to talk about what those changes are and what changes we need to make in our curriculum.

97
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:57,798
You can go to the next slide, please.

98
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:02,685
Thank you.

99
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,146
Health education.

100
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:07,967
So the skills-based Michigan model curriculum is used in grades K to 12.

101
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:15,450
The health curriculum is also supplemented with the catch vaping curriculum and the mentors and violence prevention curriculum at the middle and high schools.

102
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:23,774
Throughout this presentation, you can access the health and physical education scope and sequence by clicking on the grade levels in each slide.

103
00:10:24,314 --> 00:10:25,355
We can move to the next slide.

104
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:31,117
Elementary health education.

105
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:38,847
At the elementary level, the Michigan model social emotional units are taught at each grade level by classroom teachers.

106
00:10:40,268 --> 00:11:01,695
Social and emotional learning is a process through which children and adults acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.

107
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:19,506
Goals of an SEL program are to promote students' self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationships, and responsible decision-making skills, and to improve students' attitudes and beliefs about self, others, and school.

108
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:27,849
The social-emotional lessons start off in kindergarten with lessons on showing respect and caring for each other.

109
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,510
Students learn how to apply please, thank you,

110
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:35,578
excuse me, and I am sorry to appropriate situations.

111
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:51,482
Students identify and practice strategies to forming friendships and learn how to identify caring touch, how to ask for a hug, how to respect other people's boundaries, including people of various ages, ethnic groups, and physical abilities.

112
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:58,324
Students learn about different kinds of feelings and identify strategies to maintain strong feelings.

113
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:03,841
Students will learn how to demonstrate giving and accepting a compliment and appreciation.

114
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:12,626
And students demonstrate ways to be responsible at home in school and to identify and locate people who can help at home in school.

115
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,147
Moving on to first grade.

116
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:28,394
Students in first grade will also continue to apply skills and apply please, thank you, excuse me, and I am sorry to appropriate situations, giving and accepting a compliment

117
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:38,495
Students will describe ways family members and friends help each other and explain the role of listening and paying attention in building and maintaining friendships.

118
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:42,418
Students will apply effective listening and attention skills.

119
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:51,045
Students will also explain decision-making and problem-solving steps and apply steps to making a decision or solve problems.

120
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:57,690
In grade two, lessons consist of recognizing a variety of personal feelings

121
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:04,385
and analyzing why it's important to identify failings to maintain personal health and healthy relationships.

122
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:08,847
Students will also learn how to express failings respectfully.

123
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:18,131
Students will identify and practice strategies for effective listening and identify ways to show respect for failings, rights, and property of others.

124
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:27,676
Students identify caring touch as a comfortable and important part of a positive relationship and demonstrate the ability to manage strong failings, including anger.

125
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:37,633
Students will identify and practice decision-making and problem-solving steps and identify people who can help them with their decision-making and problem-solving.

126
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:55,240
In grade three, lessons consist of identifying characteristics of positive role models, analyzing how friends influence others' behaviors and well-being, describe the benefits of positive friendships, and practice strategies for making and keeping positive friends.

127
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:04,201
Students recognize that each person has a unique talent or skills and identify a personal unique talent or skill in one of another person.

128
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:11,944
Students will describe ways to show acceptance of differences and demonstrate the ability to support and respect people with differences.

129
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:25,548
In fourth grade, social emotional learning lessons consist of describing strategies to manage strong failings, the practice, the use of positive self-talk to manage failings,

130
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:34,130
Students will describe the effect of teasing and bullying on others and explain what to do if you or someone else is being teased or bullied.

131
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:41,072
Students will express intentions to stop bullying as a bystander, someone who bullies others or the target of bullying.

132
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:52,777
Students will practice making a decision or solving a problem using criteria to evaluate solutions and describe and apply characteristics and practice steps of conflict resolution.

133
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:56,098
Moving on to grade five.

134
00:14:57,025 --> 00:15:03,651
The social emotional learning lessons consist of practicing strategies to continue managing strong failings to continue.

135
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:08,495
They will describe how harassing and bullying behaviors are harmful to others.

136
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:18,283
They will demonstrate how to communicate assertively and listen effectively and identify situations that might lead to trouble, including violence.

137
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:24,248
Students will identify decision-making and problem solving steps and identify people who can help.

138
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:35,434
Students will also analyze the importance of telling an adult if there are people who are in danger of hurting themselves or others and describe how to get help for that person.

139
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:42,138
Students will also set a personal goal and plan steps necessary to achieve that goal.

140
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:49,021
In fifth grade, we also have the PALS program that are presented by the Medford Police Department.

141
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:54,639
That actually replaced our old DARE program that was also outdated.

142
00:15:55,059 --> 00:16:06,622
They also review lessons on self-awareness and management, responsible decision-making skills, understanding others, communication skills, and handling responsibilities and challenges.

143
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:12,623
Another piece to fifth grade is actually presented by the nursing department.

144
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:16,444
And that is one lesson that's introduction to puberty.

145
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:22,670
And that is using the Procter and Gamble always changing curriculum.

146
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:32,652
The assessments we are using in elementary school, part of the Michigan model, we have pre and post tests provided to assess our student learning.

147
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,313
Moving on to middle school health, if we can go to the next slide.

148
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:41,154
Thank you.

149
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:45,395
So middle school health is taught by a health teacher and guidance counselors.

150
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:50,425
Guidance counselors teach the social-emotional learning units at each grade level.

151
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:57,369
And students have half a year of health and half a year of guidance in the middle school for sixth, seventh, and eighth graders.

152
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:03,612
Starting with our sixth grade, I'll go through the units and just briefly describe each unit for you.

153
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:09,536
The first one for sixth grade is drugs, tobacco, and alcohol.

154
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:13,458
In this unit, students learn the effects of alcohol, drugs, and tobacco.

155
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:20,272
and analyze why individuals choose to use or not use substances, and describe negative side effects of substances.

156
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:34,240

247
00:28:57,641 --> 00:29:01,904
We can move on to the next slide, I'm gonna be moving on to high school health education.

248
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:07,368
High school health is taught by health teachers and students here at the high school have

249
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:11,054
half a year of health and half a year of physical education every single year.

250
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:15,577
We start off with Freshman Health, which is called Introduction to Health.

Topics covered will include mental health awareness, healthy relationships, disease prevention and sexual education.

253
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:31,828

increase social emotional awareness through team building exercises.

255
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:45,769

256
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:54,753
Students will understand what health and wellness, I'm sorry, the meaning of health and wellness, and begin to evaluate their own personal meaning of what those words mean to them.

Moving on to a mental health lesson.

259
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:13,024
Again, this is also brought through all four years at the high school, so I won't repeat it when I go over the next grades.

The reason we do this through all four grades

264
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:40,165
is stress can change from year to year, what affects them can change from year to year and what works on them can change from year to year.

265
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:43,766

358
00:39:38,403 --> 00:39:46,907
Assessments, again, for high school health are rubrics and pre and post tests provided with the Michigan model curriculum to assess student learning.

359
00:39:47,207 --> 00:39:51,229
And also some of these units included some projects, which would also be an assessment of learning.

360
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,930
We can move to the next slide.

361
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,611
I think we are on to physical education.

362
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:00,133
Thank you.

363
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:04,015
And if you look at those pages there, those are actually our students.

364
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:04,855
Hi.

365
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:06,656
Rachel, hold on a second.

366
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:14,362
I just thought before we move on, it might be useful to take some questions regarding the health education piece.

367
00:40:17,747 --> 00:40:20,809
Is that okay for us to divide it up like that?

368
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:27,375
So if we do divide it that way, we just need to be cognizant of the time because we're at 540.

369
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:42,467
The PE portion will not be, I think it's more self-explanatory so that it will not take as long to give all of the descriptions and we could kind of do the

370
00:40:43,448 --> 00:41:01,953
the, you know, the headers that the key shifts between the grade levels, but I did want to ensure that for the health curriculum that we were thorough in letting, you know, the committee know the progression of health instruction from kindergarten through high school.

371
00:41:02,414 --> 00:41:07,195
So that was why, you know, we wanted to make sure that we were very thorough in that.

372
00:41:08,735 --> 00:41:12,516
Okay, so are there questions at this time on the health education?

373
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:15,457
What's the preference?

374
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:17,598
Jenny, what would you prefer to do?

375
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:18,979
Do you wanna move on or do you wanna?

376
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:24,981
I think it would make sense to ask some questions now, yeah.

377
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,822
Okay, we'll watch the time.

378
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:28,702
It's 5.41.

379
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:31,363
Let's do this like in 10 minutes or so.

380
00:41:32,263 --> 00:41:36,245
Okay, so Paul, I see your hand up.

381
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:37,999
Thank you, yes.

382
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:46,185
So I'm reviewing our presentation from February 25th from last year, you know, just before the end of days started.

383
00:41:47,266 --> 00:42:01,077
And I realized that that is the, we have the national standard that you presented, each of the different core concepts and, you know, where they occurred, what grade level.

384
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:04,480
And that presentation is a,

385
00:42:05,328 --> 00:42:09,850
as detailed as this presentation was, that one was far more granular.

386
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:15,652
And I just want to know, you know, some of the things that I didn't hear mentioned were gender identity.

387
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:21,935
I mean, telling seniors about gender identity is sort of, you know, telling an 80 year old about retirement.

388
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:24,316
It's kind of like, yeah, they've heard of it already.

389
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:30,639
And I just want to make sure that, you know, we have it listed that it will be in the six through eight.

390
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:33,080
Are we doing that in six through eight or?

391
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:39,129
Are we really not talking about it until they could teach us about gender identity?

392
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,552
So we talk a little bit in sixth grade about sexuality and gender identity.

393
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:45,012
It's very brief.

394
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:52,856
I do want to make sure you also are aware that the sexuality national guidelines have just changed.

395
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:58,178
So I need to actually unpack those and take a look at what's going on in those as well.

396
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:03,101
And I'll probably have to bring those before you to make any changes.

397
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:07,435
They do, but in sixth grade about sexuality and gender identity.

398
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:08,615
Okay.

399
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:20,459
Cause like in the, I think gender, the only thing I remember from the entire progression was around seniors and, you know, understanding gender and how gender, you know, influences everything.

400
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:32,702
Um, and my, my first reaction was, isn't that for kindergartners and first graders before they have already decided that, no, that's for boys and that's for girls and, um, waiting until their seniors seems,

401
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,331
strangely late, but maybe it's just that it's not in the presentation, right?

402
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:40,072
It's more in depth this senior year.

403
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:42,932
We do touch upon it in sixth grade, but it is more in depth senior.

404
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:47,873
We also touch upon it as freshmen in the sexual, in the sex ed piece.

405
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:48,714
Okay.

406
00:43:49,354 --> 00:44:01,617
Um, and then my other question was around, um, you know, I heard a lot of words in the elementary section that are, when I look at the, you know, the various curriculum around the word around consent, um, and,

407
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:12,218
you know, as you know, the having the right language, a consistent language that progresses all the way through so that, you know, you get to middle school and the teachers and staff aren't talking a totally different language.

408
00:44:12,938 --> 00:44:14,739
And I didn't hear the word consent.

409
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:17,321
I heard all of the pieces of consent.

410
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:30,970
But, you know, what I read is that we should be teaching consent, obviously not, you know, teach kindergartners around about sexual consent, but about touching and using the word consent so that it's literally

411
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:38,530
the word they all know and they, it's not foreign to them when it becomes a different thing as they get older.

412
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,791
Are we doing that yet?

413
00:44:41,752 --> 00:44:44,634
We do that in the elementary school about appropriate touch.

414
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:48,357
Yes, we don't call it consent, but it is appropriate touch.

415
00:44:49,637 --> 00:44:49,938
Okay.

416
00:44:50,018 --> 00:44:51,659
In having, you know, guidelines and.

417
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,120
Yeah.

418
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,243
So do we, do we, do we specifically teach positive consent?

419
00:44:58,343 --> 00:45:00,245
You know, affirmative consent, I think actually is what it's called.

420
00:45:00,285 --> 00:45:00,525
Sorry.

421
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,636
just because the girl didn't say no isn't good enough.

422
00:45:05,096 --> 00:45:06,296
In middle school, yes.

423
00:45:06,977 --> 00:45:07,577
Okay, good.

424
00:45:08,017 --> 00:45:24,421
And then my last thing was, I kept hearing, I heard the word abstinence probably 150 times, not 150 times, but I heard it more than any other word, probably three or four times more than any other word.

425
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:28,062
And I obviously don't have any problem with abstinence.

426
00:45:28,122 --> 00:45:30,543
I just, it felt a bit like,

427
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,692
here's all the bad stuff, as if sex is not a good thing.

428
00:45:36,373 --> 00:45:43,076
Everybody on this call is an adult, and I don't know your personal lives, but I'll go out on a limb, and we don't all actually think sex is a bad thing.

429
00:45:44,697 --> 00:45:47,379
And do we ever talk about sex in a positive light?

430
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,661
So we do promote abstinence.

431
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:55,179
The age of consent is 16.

432
00:45:55,219 --> 00:46:03,261
We do have students that are under 16, and we need to make sure that we are promoting abstinence and that they are aware of the laws and things like that.

433
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:10,282
We do talk about healthy relationships and being with someone you love and that being a positive thing.

434
00:46:10,522 --> 00:46:19,064
But we also need to make sure that we are following guidelines, standards, and laws, if that answers your question.

435
00:46:19,868 --> 00:46:23,949
Yeah, it just sounds like we have a curriculum to make parents happy.

436
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:31,952
We don't have one that takes the kids as the primary consideration, which is every health curriculum probably in the entire country.

437
00:46:32,032 --> 00:46:35,253
But I mean, I'm not disappointed in you.

438
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:42,375
I'm disappointed in the entire orientation that once you get to college, then you can discover that sex isn't a horrible thing.

439
00:46:44,256 --> 00:46:48,377
And all the mental health consequences of teaching our kids

440
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:53,436
that their bodies are bad for 12 straight years.

441
00:46:56,698 --> 00:46:59,620
I'm glad Stacey's not on the call.

442
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,262
I guess that's my only other comment.

443
00:47:02,382 --> 00:47:02,662
Thank you.

444
00:47:02,762 --> 00:47:02,842
OK.

445
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:04,203
Jenny, do you have any questions?

446
00:47:07,104 --> 00:47:11,087
I think my question is really about why this curriculum?

447
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:13,668
Why do we think this is the best curriculum out there?

448
00:47:13,688 --> 00:47:18,071
Are there better curricula?

449
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:27,518
This, I'm a little taken aback that we're using a video from a consumer product company to teach children about puberty.

450
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:29,880
Like that is a little bit mind-blowing.

451
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,102
I also hear that if you are my age and you went to Medford Public Schools, you watched the same video.

452
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:41,466
And I just have to feel like we've progressed beyond this point in 2021.

453
00:47:41,506 --> 00:47:42,646
So I, I'm, I, I'm,

454
00:47:48,813 --> 00:47:56,755
struggling with this being the very best representation of what we can deliver for our students.

455
00:47:57,496 --> 00:47:57,916
Absolutely.

456
00:47:57,956 --> 00:47:58,436
I understand.

457
00:47:58,496 --> 00:48:02,257
So that video is not part of the Michigan model that's used in fifth grade.

458
00:48:02,677 --> 00:48:05,238
And that is actually on going forward.

459
00:48:05,278 --> 00:48:15,961
That's something that I want to work with the director of nursing on to really unpack what that lesson is and look at the national standards and see where our gaps are and how we can do better at that level.

460
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:17,942
So that is not a Michigan model.

461
00:48:19,672 --> 00:48:23,313
And then the Michigan model was chosen because it is a skills-based model.

462
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:28,574
I looked at other area schools and districts to see what they were using.

463
00:48:28,714 --> 00:48:34,395
We actually tried it here for a year at each level and our teachers really liked it.

464
00:48:34,455 --> 00:48:38,416
So that's why we choose the Michigan model for health because it did encompass everything that we were looking for.

465
00:48:40,577 --> 00:48:41,557
Jenny, can I interrupt for a second?

466
00:48:42,177 --> 00:48:43,697
Sure.

467
00:48:44,097 --> 00:48:47,518
Are we still showing the girls, the girls' videos and the boys, the boys' videos?

468
00:48:48,953 --> 00:48:50,714
I believe they are at the fifth grade level.

469
00:48:50,774 --> 00:48:54,197
I would have to confirm that with the nursing department, but I believe they are.

470
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:57,799
And that's, again, something to look at.

471
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,021
Yeah, I mean, I think we need to urgently look at that.

472
00:49:01,842 --> 00:49:07,626
I mean, the laws of this country are written by men who don't know what women's bodies are.

473
00:49:08,086 --> 00:49:11,048
And we're literally reinforcing that.

474
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:16,032
And I think we need to urgently make sure that boys don't think

475
00:49:17,202 --> 00:49:21,686
Menstruation is this abomination that can't be mentioned or even taught to them.

476
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:30,895
I mean, we can't wait another year or two years or three years for something that should have been 50 years ago.

477
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:38,531
Rachel can we, um, is that something that you can send us the videos.

478
00:49:39,032 --> 00:49:40,514
Yeah, I can send you the link to it.

479
00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:44,479
Perhaps you could share it with, with, with us.

480
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,483
So we could see how they're handled.

481
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:49,905
And is that something you're.

482
00:49:51,479 --> 00:49:55,342
that comes under, I mean, nursing, I heard you mention Tony.

483
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:56,944
So where does it fall?

484
00:49:57,404 --> 00:50:10,875
So the nurses have been presenting that lesson, not the physical education teachers, although at some schools, I think the male physical education teachers are showing the videos to help out the nurses, but we're not necessarily, it's not in our curriculum.

485
00:50:11,316 --> 00:50:11,916
Okay, Susie.

486
00:50:11,936 --> 00:50:13,177
That's something we can look at.

487
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:17,301
Susie, I see your hand up, Susanne.

488
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:30,337
I just wanted to clarify to member Rousseau's comment that just in certain situations, the principals work with families when these videos come up.

489
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:37,602
If there are students that are transitioning or transgender, the students are choosing the,

490
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:47,016
puberty video that they want to participate in and that they relate with.

491
00:50:47,316 --> 00:50:48,997
So I just wanted to make that clear.

492
00:50:49,278 --> 00:50:57,264
Yes, the nurses typically still give it to the girls and the PE teachers will give it to the boys or they'll separate them out that way.

493
00:50:58,265 --> 00:51:02,368
But students are able to choose which video they most relate to.

494
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:12,027
It certainly would be interesting to see if there is a video which, in fact, addresses all of these questions to the kids at once.

495
00:51:12,107 --> 00:51:14,348
I mean, we have come a long way.

496
00:51:14,468 --> 00:51:20,611
So I would say that it would make sense for us to look into that right now.

497
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:21,972
Paul?

498
00:51:22,653 --> 00:51:23,593
Yeah, I just wanted to add one.

499
00:51:23,913 --> 00:51:31,397
I certainly don't have any issues with separating the students out for the videos, if that's what makes sense developmentally.

500
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:51,670
but that they would only see one side of the story of half the human race is the part that I, and I'm really happy to hear that since we are separating them out, that for students that are transitioning, that we are allowing them to pick the one that works best is I think is fabulous.

501
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:57,453
And that if the students are broken out by the binary genders,

502
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,022
that that still needs to continue.

503
00:52:01,382 --> 00:52:04,684
But the videos they're seeing is sort of was my issue.

504
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:06,006
Thank you.

505
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:11,550
I wanted to ask one question about there used to be a unit on dating violence.

506
00:52:12,871 --> 00:52:15,553
And I remember an outside group coming in and make a presentation.

507
00:52:15,573 --> 00:52:16,694
Does that still?

508
00:52:18,455 --> 00:52:24,280
We have as part of the freshman curriculum, it's mentors and violence prevention.

509
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:28,065
We actually had our health teachers trained in mentors and violence prevention.

510
00:52:28,085 --> 00:52:29,771
So we don't have an outside group come in anymore.

511
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:31,036
So they address those lessons.

512
00:52:31,156 --> 00:52:31,276
Yep.

513
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:32,358
Okay, great.

514
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:39,102
Okay, so I think at this point, it makes sense for us to move on to the physical education.

515
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:41,363
And then at the end, if anybody has thought of more questions.

516
00:52:41,403 --> 00:52:43,224
And if we have time, we can come back.

517
00:52:43,724 --> 00:52:44,725
So if you'd be so kind.

518
00:52:46,025 --> 00:52:47,366
I promise this one will be quicker.

519
00:52:49,887 --> 00:52:54,690
Alright, so starting with elementary physical education, go to the next slide.

520
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:58,452
There we go.

521
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:09,542
All right, at the elementary level, our goal is to teach students basic skills and concepts that will enable them to participate in a wide variety of physical activities with success and enjoyment.

522
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:15,685
As basic skills are learned, they apply to a wide variety of games, dance, and fitness activities.

523
00:53:16,145 --> 00:53:19,646
You'll notice in each grade level, we have the same units.

524
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:25,609
And as students advance, then move into upper grades, those skills get more difficult.

525
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:31,935
So what we kind of do is group the students into grades K to two, and then three to five.

526
00:53:32,595 --> 00:53:54,322
In K to two, we're doing some basic things like locomotor skills, walk, run, skip, hop, leap, jump, manipulative skills, underhand throwing to overhand throwing and catching, dribbling with the feet, controlling the ball, stick handling, volleying a ball, batting a ball off of a tee, stick, I already said stick handling, cooperative games,

527
00:53:54,870 --> 00:54:00,711
We do parachute games, spatial awareness games, fitness, dance, and movement, and yoga.

528
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,152
And that's, like I said, at a basic level.

529
00:54:03,552 --> 00:54:09,493
When we move on to grades three to five, we incorporate things that are a little bit more difficult.

530
00:54:09,934 --> 00:54:17,355
For example, we're refining our locomotor skills and maybe hopping, jumping, skipping over or around things to make things more difficult.

531
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:20,576
We're striking and kicking maybe at a target.

532
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:24,637
We're batting a pitched ball.

533
00:54:25,158 --> 00:54:30,640
Things like that were stick handling and shooting at an object like a net.

534
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,660
And we're also incorporating more gameplay.

535
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:39,662
So that is the basis of our elementary physical education curriculum.

536
00:54:40,002 --> 00:54:45,524
And if you want, if you can go through each one of those and read exactly what's done in each grade level.

537
00:54:46,177 --> 00:54:47,959
Moving on to middle school.

538
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,601
So the next slide.

539
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:50,482
Thank you.

540
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:57,989
The middle school physical education curriculum program builds upon the knowledge and skills that are practicing grades K to five.

541
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:04,456
Our goal is to teach more advanced skills and concepts that will allow students to continue to improve and grow their skill base.

542
00:55:05,117 --> 00:55:08,120
You'll notice the same units again in all middle school grades.

543
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:11,811
However, skills are more advanced as the students move into upper grades.

544
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:20,097
You can read it, but I'm going to give you a couple of different examples, and then I'll move on to high school so that you guys have that time.

545
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:20,958
I know you have another meeting.

546
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:29,925
For example, when we look at target games, bowling and pinball, in sixth grade, we'll go over the history and the three-step approach.

547
00:55:30,546 --> 00:55:34,589
The next year, we'll review the history, and we'll go over scoring.

548
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:39,649
In eighth grade, we'll go over a five-step approach, scoring, and a strike and a spare.

549
00:55:40,089 --> 00:55:44,691
So we have extended among that basic information.

550
00:55:45,352 --> 00:55:51,195
Invasion games, for example, soccer, we'll start with passing, trapping, and dribbling along with history.

551
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:56,258
Then we'll go on to shooting, defense, and 5v5 soccer.

552
00:55:56,778 --> 00:55:59,760
Moving into eighth grade, where we're going to go 5v5 to 7v7 soccer.

553
00:56:01,523 --> 00:56:06,167
teaching students to move to open spaces and giving goes and strategies like that.

554
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:10,830
So that's woven throughout the entire middle school curriculum.

555
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,613
We start basic and then we move on to what they should be doing in eighth grade.

556
00:56:15,093 --> 00:56:17,595
These are also based on our national standards.

557
00:56:17,615 --> 00:56:20,677
So you can see the standard for each grade and where students should be.

558
00:56:22,439 --> 00:56:29,204
And that goes on throughout the two things that were added recently to our middle school curriculum were dance and yoga.

559
00:56:29,902 --> 00:56:36,748
Those were the things that we really didn't have much of so that we wanted to make sure that we were following all of the standards and those were the things that we added.

560
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,831
So we can go to the next slide.

561
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:42,674
We're going to move on to high school physical education.

562
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:54,305
No, I think you clicked on one of the links, yeah.

563
00:56:56,499 --> 00:57:02,224
All right, high school physical education program builds upon the knowledge and skills taught at the elementary and middle schools.

564
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:13,655
The freshman physical education curriculum is fitness based and allows students to learn about the five components of fitness, fitness testing, how to improve fitness and how to set up their own fitness routine.

565
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:22,523
What we've added to our freshman physical education recently is how to stay safe in and around water and basic swim techniques.

566
00:57:25,223 --> 00:57:28,865
A sophomore physical education, which is called wellness activities.

567
00:57:29,306 --> 00:57:44,095
This course is designed to introduce the student to the seven dimensions of wellness and students learn about dimensions of wellness by participating in activities that address leadership, decision-making, commitment, risk-taking, stress management, compassion, and personal fitness.

568
00:57:46,656 --> 00:57:54,621
For juniors and seniors in physical education, as you see under sophomore on this slide, we have first aid and CPR, get fit,

569
00:57:55,068 --> 00:58:01,690
lifeguard training, lifetime activities, outdoor pursuits, team sports, water games, and yoga.

570
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:06,192
Our juniors and seniors get to choose what they want to take for physical education.

571
00:58:07,712 --> 00:58:11,314
And they take one class junior year and one class in their senior year.

572
00:58:11,854 --> 00:58:19,656
Our first aid, CPR, and our lifeguard training, you can actually get your certification through taking these courses.

573
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:21,737
So that's a great opportunity for our students.

574
00:58:22,537 --> 00:58:23,998
As you know, I oversee the pool as well.

575
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:32,097
Some of my guards have taken the class through physical education department and are employed at the pool.

576
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:33,758
So that's a great opportunity for them.

577
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:44,380
And for first aid and CPR, we have a lot of students that might work at camps or daycares and things like that part time, and they can actually obtain their certification here at school and get credit for it.

578
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,400
So that's a great opportunity as well.

579
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:53,682
Get fit, we do some walking, we do a yoga unit, and we do a lot of different workouts using our fitness center.

580
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:00,933
outdoor pursuits, which ones outdoor readiness, hiking and snowshoeing when we do have snow.

581
00:59:01,574 --> 00:59:04,155
Um, then we move on to team sports.

582
00:59:04,696 --> 00:59:06,997
We have a different team sports game units.

583
00:59:07,037 --> 00:59:12,761
We've also add some coaching and officiating into that for our students that might be interested in, in that piece.

584
00:59:13,582 --> 00:59:17,505
Um, water games was something that we've recently added as well.

585
00:59:17,665 --> 00:59:25,370
We do a water safety unit as part of that, a swimming unit, and then we go into different games that can be played in the water and then our yoga.

586
00:59:27,582 --> 00:59:34,284
We start with introduction, we move into beginner, and then we do actually go into more intermediate yoga exercises as well.

587
00:59:34,664 --> 00:59:40,026
We also do a piece of this is a journaling exercise that we're doing.

588
00:59:41,126 --> 00:59:48,849
At the end of each class, students journal about how they felt before class, how they felt after class, what might be going on with them.

589
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:55,831
It's just an opportunity for them to kind of reflect to see how class went and how they're feeling at the end, which is a great opportunity.

590
00:59:56,675 --> 01:00:03,438
Um, you can move on to the next slide on this, um, for assessment for all of these classes.

591
01:00:03,678 --> 01:00:08,860
Um, we are doing, um, skill assessment and rubrics for physical education as well.

592
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:11,802
Moving on to professional development.

593
01:00:12,702 --> 01:00:23,547
In addition to what the district has provided, uh, for professional development, the physical education and health education teachers this year have, um, done CPR certification.

594
01:00:23,747 --> 01:00:25,788
They, we just completed that in March.

595
01:00:26,355 --> 01:00:29,857
And first aid certification will be completing in June.

596
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:34,139
And they've also taken part in relaxation techniques and self-care.

597
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,601
That was a presentation by Seth Monk.

598
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:39,781
I don't know if any of you remember him.

599
01:00:39,821 --> 01:00:51,747
He's done presentations for us before to really go over some relaxation techniques that our staff can use to bring to their students, but also use for themselves during everything that's going on right now.

600
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:56,363
Um, you can actually move to the next slide.

601
01:00:59,003 --> 01:00:59,563
Thank you.

602
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:07,665
Um, so moving forward, I know in the past we've talked about, um, hiring a middle school health teacher so that we have one in each building.

603
01:01:08,405 --> 01:01:13,286
Um, so we're, we're looking to add that and to hire adaptive physical education teacher.

604
01:01:13,306 --> 01:01:15,567
We're also looking to add that still.

605
01:01:15,587 --> 01:01:18,267
We haven't been able to do that yet under curriculum.

606
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:22,188
Um, you see, I have reviewing the always changing puberty curriculum with the director of nursing.

607
01:01:23,509 --> 01:01:28,894
And I also wanted to review the flash curriculum for our special education students to make sure that we are inclusive.

608
01:01:30,075 --> 01:01:38,982
Professional development, we would look to provide some sex education professional development as we, like I spoke about before, the standards have changed.

609
01:01:40,123 --> 01:01:50,411
We need to maybe get some more training on that and unpack those as well and provide adaptive PE professional development for the entire physical education staff.

610
01:01:52,387 --> 01:02:00,393
One more piece I just wanted to add is that, due to the pandemic, the health and physical education curriculum had to be adjusted to meet the needs of our students.

611
01:02:01,374 --> 01:02:06,037
Health education covered time management skills, stress relief, and things like yoga.

612
01:02:07,818 --> 01:02:14,563
Now that we're in person, we're coming back to our curriculum set that I showed you here today.

613
01:02:15,044 --> 01:02:19,387
And physical education classes were front loaded with lessons that included no equipment.

614
01:02:19,793 --> 01:02:24,979
So at the beginning, we were doing things like fitness, yoga, relaxation, because kids were at home.

615
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,062
They don't necessarily have equipment at home.

616
01:02:27,642 --> 01:02:33,910
My teachers did a great job using what they could to get students to be active.

617
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,313
You can go to the next slide.

618
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:38,335
I believe that is it.

619
01:02:38,575 --> 01:02:39,897
And I think that's your question slide.

620
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:42,319
Great.

621
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,181
Thank you, Rachel.

622
01:02:43,601 --> 01:02:45,845
Rachel, I'm going to start off the questioning this time.

623
01:02:46,405 --> 01:02:51,793
You did on the last slide hit the most important questions for me right now.

624
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:58,123
The adaptive PE, to what level are we offering and meeting the needs of special education students?

625
01:02:58,543 --> 01:03:00,224
for instance, autistic students.

626
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:04,427
And you mentioned the flash curriculum, is it good for special ed?

627
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,149
But as we were going through all the class levels, that was exactly what I was curious about.

628
01:03:09,469 --> 01:03:20,836
For example, if we have a substantially separate high school class that's held at the high school, are those students receiving health education and how is it modified appropriately?

629
01:03:21,837 --> 01:03:27,460
So we do have some students going into health classes and we do have some students that

630
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:29,211
might be separated for certain things.

631
01:03:29,271 --> 01:03:33,413
It depends on what their IEP calls for.

632
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:36,975
We are adapting our health education units.

633
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:41,998
We do use a little bit of units that are lower grades to adapt right now.

634
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:46,241
The flash curriculum is specifically for special education students.

635
01:03:46,261 --> 01:03:52,725
So I wanted to take a look at that so that we can compare to what we have now to see if that would be a better option for us.

636
01:03:53,773 --> 01:03:57,694
And is that then an outside curriculum?

637
01:03:59,455 --> 01:03:59,675
It is.

638
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:00,195
It's an online.

639
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,355
It's actually a free curriculum.

640
01:04:02,236 --> 01:04:02,696
It's free?

641
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:03,276
Yes.

642
01:04:03,636 --> 01:04:04,497
Music to my ears.

643
01:04:04,857 --> 01:04:05,397
Yes.

644
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:06,457
I thought that would be.

645
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,238
Is there a way?

646
01:04:09,298 --> 01:04:11,459
Could you send us a link for that so we could see that?

647
01:04:11,939 --> 01:04:12,519
Absolutely.

648
01:04:12,939 --> 01:04:13,259
OK.

649
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:21,142
So to Jenny or Paul in particular, what questions might you have for Rachel?

650
01:04:23,563 --> 01:04:30,827
I just had some additional questions about the health curriculum, but I would defer if there's questions about P before we cycle back there.

651
01:04:33,629 --> 01:04:34,289
Okay, so.

652
01:04:38,555 --> 01:04:49,446
I don't feel like I totally, and maybe it's just sort of where I've entered this conversation, but I don't feel like I totally understand when you said we tried this and we liked it.

653
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:52,528
I don't understand what the methodology was there.

654
01:04:52,749 --> 01:04:54,590
Did we try two things and we liked this better?

655
01:04:56,292 --> 01:05:06,557
Do you think that there would be a change of that opinion when there are dedicated health professionals, particularly at the middle school level rather than guidance counselors conducting this training?

656
01:05:06,577 --> 01:05:13,860
I mean, just overall, like there's just nothing stand out about the description of the curriculum.

657
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:23,024
And maybe that's just the description, I'm not sure, but I'm just curious, like what is so great about this curriculum that we have in place?

658
01:05:23,564 --> 01:05:25,185
So it is a skills-based model.

659
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,751
And that's what our national standards call for.

660
01:05:28,771 --> 01:05:32,072
So we are using a skill-based model and that's what we were looking for.

661
01:05:32,452 --> 01:05:38,354
I do have designated health teachers that are licensed health teachers teaching it at the high school and one at the middle school.

662
01:05:38,674 --> 01:05:41,495
And they did try it and really liked the curriculum.

663
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:46,637
They did have second step that they were using before this.

664
01:05:46,857 --> 01:05:48,397
And that was very outdated.

665
01:05:48,457 --> 01:05:50,798
And it was something that was not very easy to follow.

666
01:05:50,898 --> 01:05:53,459
And it did not address all the skills that

667
01:05:54,399 --> 01:05:56,200
we needed to address at that time.

668
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,461
And that is why we went with the Michigan model.

669
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:04,563
Like I said, I did look at what other districts were doing, and this was something that was recommended by other districts as well.

670
01:06:05,263 --> 01:06:18,648
So Jenny, in the past, in prior years, this was a deep conversation as we were looking at our curriculum and seeing it was not adequate.

671
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:22,650
And so there was much discussion about

672
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:37,439
looking at our curriculum and looking at the Michigan model, which sort of rose like the cream to the top and talking about that, getting feedback from our principals and from our teachers.

673
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:45,964
It was, I would say that it was, you know, it's always important to review curriculum and to make sure they're still meeting our needs.

674
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:49,186
But I do want to say that this was something that was,

675
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:51,367
I don't know if that is.

676
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:54,089
Thoroughly talked about on the school committee level.

677
01:06:58,491 --> 01:06:58,832
I just.

678
01:06:59,672 --> 01:07:02,714
This the scope and sequence seems so.

679
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:11,979
Slow to me in terms of like when topics are being covered and I. That is just sort of my reaction.

680
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,019
I.

681
01:07:20,647 --> 01:07:23,971
There are fourth grade girls who get their period.

682
01:07:23,991 --> 01:07:32,021
All of these things, like as long as we might want these

683
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:37,818
life decisions to be put off as adults.

684
01:07:38,698 --> 01:07:44,901
We can want that all we want, but it's education's job to prepare students.

685
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:53,984
And I don't have a huge comfort level that we're preparing our students as best we could at the moment.

686
01:07:54,765 --> 01:07:57,686
That doesn't mean the curriculum is not capable of that.

687
01:07:58,326 --> 01:07:58,887
I don't know.

688
01:07:59,107 --> 01:08:01,648
There is still a huge gap for me that I haven't

689
01:08:02,628 --> 01:08:05,210
been able to reconcile based on this conversation.

690
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:30,544
And I just want to make sure that if there's something that you need to really have us all feel good, and you're the expert, so I care more about what you think than what I think, but I want us to feel like we are being modern in our approach and that we are

691
01:08:31,785 --> 01:08:38,788
making sure that we are preparing students for the life that they will live, whether we prepare them or not.

692
01:08:39,588 --> 01:08:56,734
And however we need to do that, if that is this curriculum, that's fabulous news, it's already in house, but if there's something else that is needed, I just want us to identify that as quickly as possible so that we can get it in place.

693
01:08:57,577 --> 01:08:58,238
Superintendent?

694
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:10,953
I just wanted to say, Memogram, in response to some of your comments, that yes, Michigan model is definitely one of the models that is respected.

695
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:15,118
And again, the fact that it's skills-based in the opening

696
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:17,580
Rachel, Ms.

697
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:27,205
Perry was sharing about following the national standards as opposed to the state standards because the national, the state curriculum, I believe, went back to 99.

698
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:31,807
It's in the process of being updated, but it hasn't happened just yet.

699
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:35,029
So the state, the national standards are the standards that

700
01:09:35,509 --> 01:09:40,191
people should be paying attention to and the fact that it is skill space.

701
01:09:40,232 --> 01:09:49,696
So I just want you to know that Michigan model is definitely respected for at least being one of the stronger programs out there.

702
01:09:50,377 --> 01:10:03,604
And in regards to your second comment about it's true, girls are developing and hitting puberty at younger ages, especially students of color.

703
01:10:04,524 --> 01:10:11,570
Black and brown are hitting, students are hitting puberty at exceptionally younger ages.

704
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:31,546
And so that is something, but research is also talking about from the health umbrella or health perspective for us also to provide education on the importance of healthy eating because certain foods right now, you know,

705
01:10:32,367 --> 01:10:53,662
people who aren't medical experts are saying, is it the hormones that's being given to corn or chicken or whatever it is that you're eating, that the hormones are also almost pushing young girls into puberty at much younger and earlier ages.

706
01:10:54,203 --> 01:10:59,927
So I do think the aspect about healthy eating, healthy lifestyle,

707
01:11:01,608 --> 01:11:30,275
you know being active because all of that and you know with the puberty onset of puberty it's also connected to weight so um if there's early obesity and other or signs of that that like one thing can trigger the other which can trigger the other so it it it definitely is something that you know I think we're aware of and we do have to definitely listen to um

708
01:11:31,135 --> 01:11:44,725
medical guidance, but I just wanted to let you know that we're aware that there are a lot of factors and how it just is impacting society in general.

709
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:49,428
So I just wanted to add that comment to what you were saying earlier.

710
01:11:49,829 --> 01:11:50,169
Thank you.

711
01:11:55,032 --> 01:11:56,093
Okay.

712
01:11:56,233 --> 01:11:58,315
Are there any other questions for Ms.

713
01:11:58,335 --> 01:11:58,575
Perry?

714
01:12:00,645 --> 01:12:04,206
Rachel, Paul, no, Jenny.

715
01:12:05,486 --> 01:12:06,246
Okay.

716
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:07,206
Great.

717
01:12:07,566 --> 01:12:07,926
Okay.

718
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:11,467
So thank you so much, Rachel, and thank you everybody else for attending who's here.

719
01:12:11,607 --> 01:12:12,547
I really appreciate it.

720
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:21,569
And we have a meeting, school committee meeting starting at, what time is it starting, six o'clock?

721
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:23,730
Seven o'clock.

722
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:24,810
Seven o'clock.

723
01:12:26,224 --> 01:12:26,404
Great.

724
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:27,988
So we'll see you all at seven o'clock.

725
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:28,689
Thank you so much.

726
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:29,270
Motion to adjourn.

727
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:30,012
Motion to adjourn.

728
01:12:30,032 --> 01:12:30,633
Motion to adjourn.

729
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:31,555
Second.

730
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:34,601
Paul Russo?

731
01:12:35,183 --> 01:12:35,363
Yes.

732
01:12:36,325 --> 01:12:36,826
Jenny Graham?

733
01:12:37,207 --> 01:12:37,407
Yes.

734
01:12:38,008 --> 01:12:38,710
Paulette VanderKloop?

735
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:38,890
Yes.
