href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=442.484s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=443.044s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=444.486s">Problem.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=445.386s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=446.007s">So</a>  I'll just talk a little bit about the presentation topics first, then we'll dive right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=451.011s">First,</a>  we're going to talk a little bit about the MAS frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=454.634s">We'll</a>  move on to national health education and physical education standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=459.829s">And</a>  then we'll go into the elementary, middle and high school health curriculum and the physical education curriculum, talk a little bit about professional development and then moving forward 2021 and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=473.901s">Moving</a>  to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=477.984s">And</a>  next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=481.607s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=482.167s">So</a>  I'm gonna talk a little bit about our program description and then we'll talk about the frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=488.69s">The</a>  goal of the Physical Education and Health Education Department of Medford Public Schools is to enhance the well-being of the school community by creating a culture that integrates and balances the six dimensions of wellness, social, physical, intellectual, occupational, emotional, and spiritual. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=505.981s">The</a>  department strives to encourage an active, healthy lifestyle, healthy decision-making, and a lifelong commitment to wellness. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=514.432s">The</a>  Massachusetts state health education and physical education frameworks were last updated in 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=521.878s">Since</a>  these frameworks are not up to date, Medford Public Schools health education and physical education curriculum are aligned to the physical education, health education, and sexual education national standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=535.708s">Medford</a>  Public Schools health curriculum is based on the seven health education skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=541.413s">analyzing</a>  influences, accessing information, interpersonal communication, decision-making, goal-setting, practicing health-enhancing behaviors, and advocacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=554.083s">We</a>  will revise our curricula to follow updated standards as they are released. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=558.987s">You</a>  will find links to the state and national standards at the bottom of the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=563.411s">Right</a>  now, from what I understand, the Department of Education is doing an update and an edit <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=571.34s">to</a>  the frameworks, and then that's going to be put out for public opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=575.963s">Then</a>  they'll do another edit from there, and then they will be released. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=579.245s">I</a>  don't know how long those will take, but once we get them, I will unpack them with my staff, and then we'll have to align what we're doing to those standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=588.372s">Then</a>  I imagine I'll be coming before you all again to talk about what those changes are and what changes we need to make in our curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=595.356s">You</a>  can go to the next slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=602.165s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=603.185s">Health</a>  education. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=604.266s">So</a>  the skills-based Michigan model curriculum is used in grades K to 12. <a

high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=616.071s">Throughout</a>  this presentation, you can access the health and physical education scope and sequence by clicking on the grade levels

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2405.595s">Rachel,</a>  hold on a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2407.875s">I</a>  just thought before we move on, it might be useful to take some questions regarding the health education piece.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2417.747s">Is</a>  that okay for us to divide it up like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2421.39s">So</a>  if we do divide it that way, we just need to be cognizant of the time because we're at 540. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2427.815s">The</a>  PE portion will not be, I think it's more self-explanatory so that it will not take as long to give all of the descriptions and we could kind of do the <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2443.448s">the,</a>  you know, the headers that the key shifts between the grade levels, but I did want to ensure that for the health curriculum that we were thorough in letting, you know, the committee know the progression of health instruction from kindergarten through high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2462.414s">So</a>  that was why, you know, we wanted to make sure that we were very thorough in that.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2468.735s">Okay,</a>  so are there questions at this time on the health education? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2473.397s">What's</a>  the preference? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2475.798s">Jenny,</a>  what would you prefer to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2477.618s">Do</a>  you wanna move on or do you wanna?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2480.299s">I</a>  think it would make sense to ask some questions now, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2485.161s">Okay,</a>  we'll watch the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2487.942s">It's</a>  5.41. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2488.942s">Let's</a>  do this like in 10 minutes or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2492.263s">Okay,</a>  so Paul, I see your hand up.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2497.058s">Thank</a>  you, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2498.359s">So</a>  I'm reviewing our presentation from February 25th from last year, you know, just before the end of days started. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2507.266s">And</a>  I realized that that is the, we have the national standard that you presented, each of the different core concepts and, you know, where they occurred, what grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2522.358s">And</a>  that presentation is a, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2525.328s">as</a>  detailed as this presentation was, that one was far more granular. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2530.63s">And</a>  I just want to know, you know, some of the things that I didn't hear mentioned were gender identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2535.713s">I</a>  mean, telling seniors about gender identity is sort of, you know, telling an 80 year old about retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2542.015s">It's</a>  kind of like, yeah, they've heard of it already. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2546.077s">And</a>  I just want to make sure that, you know, we have it listed that it will be in the six through eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2550.959s">Are</a>  we doing that in six through eight or? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2553.947s">Are</a>  we really not talking about it until they could teach us about gender identity?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2559.67s">So</a>  we talk a little bit in sixth grade about sexuality and gender identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2563.612s">It's</a>  very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2565.713s">I</a>  do want to make sure you also are aware that the sexuality national guidelines have just changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2574.157s">So</a>  I need to actually unpack those and take a look at what's going on in those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2578.519s">And</a>  I'll probably have to bring those before you to make any changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2583.934s">They</a>  do, but in sixth grade about sexuality and gender identity.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2588.435s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2588.635s">Cause</a>  like in the, I think gender, the only thing I remember from the entire progression was around seniors and, you know, understanding gender and how gender, you know, influences everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2600.479s">Um,</a>  and my, my first reaction was, isn't that for kindergartners and first graders before they have already decided that, no, that's for boys and that's for girls and, um, waiting until their seniors seems, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2613.99s">strangely</a>  late, but maybe it's just that it's not in the presentation, right?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2618.411s">It's</a>  more in depth this senior year. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2620.092s">We</a>  do touch upon it in sixth grade, but it is more in depth senior. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2623.012s">We</a>  also touch upon it as freshmen in the sexual, in the sex ed piece.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2627.894s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2629.354s">Um,</a>  and then my other question was around, um, you know, I heard a lot of words in the elementary section that are, when I look at the, you know, the various curriculum around the word around consent, um, and, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2642.291s">you</a>  know, as you know, the having the right language, a consistent language that progresses all the way through so that, you know, you get to middle school and the teachers and staff aren't talking a totally different language. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2652.938s">And</a>  I didn't hear the word consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2654.799s">I</a>  heard all of the pieces of consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2657.841s">But,</a>  you know, what I read is that we should be teaching consent, obviously not, you know, teach kindergartners around about sexual consent, but about touching and using the word consent so that it's literally <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2671.825s">the</a>  word they all know and they, it's not foreign to them when it becomes a different thing as they get older. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2679.41s">Are</a>  we doing that yet?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2681.752s">We</a>  do that in the elementary school about appropriate touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2684.974s">Yes,</a>  we don't call it consent, but it is appropriate touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2689.637s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2690.018s">In</a>  having, you know, guidelines and.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2692.88s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2693.86s">So</a>  do we, do we, do we specifically teach positive consent? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2698.343s">You</a>  know, affirmative consent, I think actually is what it's called. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2700.285s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2702.335s">just</a>  because the girl didn't say no isn't good enough.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2705.096s">In</a>  middle school, yes.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2706.977s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2708.017s">And</a>  then my last thing was, I kept hearing, I heard the word abstinence probably 150 times, not 150 times, but I heard it more than any other word, probably three or four times more than any other word. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2725.121s">And</a>  I obviously don't have any problem with abstinence. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2728.122s">I</a>  just, it felt a bit like, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2731.81s">here's</a>  all the bad stuff, as if sex is not a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2736.373s">Everybody</a>  on this call is an adult, and I don't know your personal lives, but I'll go out on a limb, and we don't all actually think sex is a bad thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2744.697s">And</a>  do we ever talk about sex in a positive light?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2748.9s">So</a>  we do promote abstinence. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2753.379s">The</a>  age of consent is 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2755.219s">We</a>  do have students that are under 16, and we need to make sure that we are promoting abstinence and that they are aware of the laws and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2763.501s">We</a>  do talk about healthy relationships and being with someone you love and that being a positive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2770.522s">But</a>  we also need to make sure that we are following guidelines, standards, and laws, if that answers your question.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2779.868s">Yeah,</a>  it just sounds like we have a curriculum to make parents happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2784.109s">We</a>  don't have one that takes the kids as the primary consideration, which is every health curriculum probably in the entire country. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2792.032s">But</a>  I mean, I'm not disappointed in you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2795.273s">I'm</a>  disappointed in the entire orientation that once you get to college, then you can discover that sex isn't a horrible thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2804.256s">And</a>  all the mental health consequences of teaching our kids <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2809.134s">that</a>  their bodies are bad for 12 straight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2816.698s">I'm</a>  glad Stacey's not on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2820.0s">I</a>  guess that's my only other comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2822.382s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2822.762s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2822.862s">Jenny,</a>  do you have any questions?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2827.104s">I</a>  think my question is really about why this curriculum? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2831.247s">Why</a>  do we think this is the best curriculum out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2833.688s">Are</a>  there better curricula? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2839.414s">This,</a>  I'm a little taken aback that we're using a video from a consumer product company to teach children about puberty. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2847.598s">Like</a>  that is a little bit mind-blowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2849.96s">I</a>  also hear that if you are my age and you went to Medford Public Schools, you watched the same video. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2855.763s">And</a>  I just have to feel like we've progressed beyond this point in 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2861.506s">So</a>  I, I'm, I, I'm, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2868.813s">struggling</a>  with this being the very best representation of what we can deliver for our students.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2877.496s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2877.956s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2878.496s">So</a>  that video is not part of the Michigan model that's used in fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2882.677s">And</a>  that is actually on going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2885.278s">That's</a>  something that I want to work with the director of nursing on to really unpack what that lesson is and look at the national standards and see where our gaps are and how we can do better at that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2896.482s">So</a>  that is not a Michigan model. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2899.672s">And</a>  then the Michigan model was chosen because it is a skills-based model. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2903.713s">I</a>  looked at other area schools and districts to see what they were using. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2908.714s">We</a>  actually tried it here for a year at each level and our teachers really liked it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2914.455s">So</a>  that's why we choose the Michigan model for health because it did encompass everything that we were looking for.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2920.577s">Jenny,</a>  can I interrupt for a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2922.177s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2924.097s">Are</a>  we still showing the girls, the girls' videos and the boys, the boys' videos?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2928.953s">I</a>  believe they are at the fifth grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2930.774s">I</a>  would have to confirm that with the nursing department, but I believe they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2934.217s">And</a>  that's, again, something to look at.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2938.74s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think we need to urgently look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2941.842s">I</a>  mean, the laws of this country are written by men who don't know what women's bodies are. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2948.086s">And</a>  we're literally reinforcing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2951.849s">And</a>  I think we need to urgently make sure that boys don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2957.202s">Menstruation</a>  is this abomination that can't be mentioned or even taught to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2962.067s">I</a>  mean, we can't wait another year or two years or three years for something that should have been 50 years ago.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2973.485s">Rachel</a>  can we, um, is that something that you can send us the videos.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2979.032s">Yeah,</a>  I can send you the link to it.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2981.675s">Perhaps</a>  you could share it with, with, with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2985.58s">So</a>  we could see how they're handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2988.904s">And</a>  is that something you're. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2991.479s">that</a>  comes under, I mean, nursing, I heard you mention Tony.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2995.943s">So</a>  where does it fall? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2997.404s">So</a>  the nurses have been presenting that lesson, not the physical education teachers, although at some schools, I think the male physical education teachers are showing the videos to help out the nurses, but we're not necessarily, it's not in our curriculum.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3011.316s">Okay,</a>  Susie.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3011.936s">That's</a>  something we can look at.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3015.719s">Susie,</a>  I see your hand up, Susanne.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3018.289s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify to member Rousseau's comment that just in certain situations, the principals work with families when these videos come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3030.417s">If</a>  there are students that are transitioning or transgender, the students are choosing the, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3040.431s">puberty</a>  video that they want to participate in and that they relate with. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3047.316s">So</a>  I just wanted to make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3049.278s">Yes,</a>  the nurses typically still give it to the girls and the PE teachers will give it to the boys or they'll separate them out that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3058.265s">But</a>  students are able to choose which video they most relate to.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3064.122s">It</a>  certainly would be interesting to see if there is a video which, in fact, addresses all of these questions to the kids at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3072.107s">I</a>  mean, we have come a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3074.468s">So</a>  I would say that it would make sense for us to look into that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3081.712s">Paul?</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3082.653s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to add one. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3083.913s">I</a>  certainly don't have any issues with separating the students out for the videos, if that's what makes sense developmentally. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3092.8s">but</a>  that they would only see one side of the story of half the human race is the part that I, and I'm really happy to hear that since we are separating them out, that for students that are transitioning, that we are allowing them to pick the one that works best is I think is fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3112.291s">And</a>  that if the students are broken out by the binary genders, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3119.2s">that</a>  that still needs to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3121.382s">But</a>  the videos they're seeing is sort of was my issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3125.425s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3126.666s">I</a>  wanted to ask one question about there used to be a unit on dating violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3132.871s">And</a>  I remember an outside group coming in and make a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3135.573s">Does</a>  that still?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3138.455s">We</a>  have as part of the freshman curriculum, it's mentors and violence prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3144.673s">We</a>  actually had our health teachers trained in mentors and violence prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3148.085s">So</a>  we don't have an outside group come in anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3149.871s">So</a>  they address those lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3151.156s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3151.798s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3153.039s">Okay,</a>  so I think at this point, it makes sense for us to move on to the physical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3159.162s">And</a>  then at the end, if anybody has thought of more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3161.403s">And</a>  if we have time, we can come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3163.724s">So</a>  if you'd be so kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3166.025s">I</a>  promise this one will be quicker.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3169.887s">Alright,</a>  so starting with elementary physical education, go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3174.71s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3179.558s">All</a>  right, at the elementary level, our goal is to teach students basic skills and concepts that will enable them to participate in a wide variety of physical activities with success and enjoyment. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3190.563s">As</a>  basic skills are learned, they apply to a wide variety of games, dance, and fitness activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3196.145s">You'll</a>  notice in each grade level, we have the same units. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3200.767s">And</a>  as students advance, then move into upper grades, those skills get more difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3206.773s">So</a>  what we kind of do is group the students into grades K to two, and then three to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3212.595s">In</a>  K to two, we're doing some basic things like locomotor skills, walk, run, skip, hop, leap, jump, manipulative skills, underhand throwing to overhand throwing and catching, dribbling with the feet, controlling the ball, stick handling, volleying a ball, batting a ball off of a tee, stick, I already said stick handling, cooperative games, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3234.87s">We</a>  do parachute games, spatial awareness games, fitness, dance, and movement, and yoga. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3241.071s">And</a>  that's, like I said, at a basic level. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3243.552s">When</a>  we move on to grades three to five, we incorporate things that are a little bit more difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3249.934s">For</a>  example, we're refining our locomotor skills and maybe hopping, jumping, skipping over or around things to make things more difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3258.135s">We're</a>  striking and kicking maybe at a target. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3260.916s">We're</a>  batting a pitched ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3265.158s">Things</a>  like that were stick handling and shooting at an object like a net. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3271.0s">And</a>  we're also incorporating more gameplay. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3275.701s">So</a>  that is the basis of our elementary physical education curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3280.002s">And</a>  if you want, if you can go through each one of those and read exactly what's done in each grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3286.177s">Moving</a>  on to middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3288.94s">So</a>  the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3290.021s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3291.022s">The</a>  middle school physical education curriculum program builds upon the knowledge and skills that are practicing grades K to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3298.47s">Our</a>  goal is to teach more advanced skills and concepts that will allow students to continue to improve and grow their skill base. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3305.117s">You'll</a>  notice the same units again in all middle school grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3308.448s">However,</a>  skills are more advanced as the students move into upper grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3312.571s">You</a>  can read it, but I'm going to give you a couple of different examples, and then I'll move on to high school so that you guys have that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3320.117s">I</a>  know you have another meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3322.92s">For</a>  example, when we look at target games, bowling and pinball, in sixth grade, we'll go over the history and the three-step approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3330.546s">The</a>  next year, we'll review the history, and we'll go over scoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3335.266s">In</a>  eighth grade, we'll go over a five-step approach, scoring, and a strike and a spare. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3340.089s">So</a>  we have extended among that basic information. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3345.352s">Invasion</a>  games, for example, soccer, we'll start with passing, trapping, and dribbling along with history. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3351.595s">Then</a>  we'll go on to shooting, defense, and 5v5 soccer. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3356.778s">Moving</a>  into eighth grade, where we're going to go 5v5 to 7v7 soccer. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3361.523s">teaching</a>  students to move to open spaces and giving goes and strategies like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3366.947s">So</a>  that's woven throughout the entire middle school curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3371.07s">We</a>  start basic and then we move on to what they should be doing in eighth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3375.093s">These</a>  are also based on our national standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3377.615s">So</a>  you can see the standard for each grade and where students should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3382.439s">And</a>  that goes on throughout the two things that were added recently to our middle school curriculum were dance and yoga. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3389.902s">Those</a>  were the things that we really didn't have much of so that we wanted to make sure that we were following all of the standards and those were the things that we added. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3398.61s">So</a>  we can go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3399.851s">We're</a>  going to move on to high school physical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3402.694s">No,</a>  I think you clicked on one of the links, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3416.499s">All</a>  right, high school physical education program builds upon the knowledge and skills taught at the elementary and middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3423.045s">The</a>  freshman physical education curriculum is fitness based and allows students to learn about the five components of fitness, fitness testing, how to improve fitness and how to set up their own fitness routine. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3434.135s">What</a>  we've added to our freshman physical education recently is how to stay safe in and around water and basic swim techniques. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3445.223s">A</a>  sophomore physical education, which is called wellness activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3449.306s">This</a>  course is designed to introduce the student to the seven dimensions of wellness and students learn about dimensions of wellness by participating in activities that address leadership, decision-making, commitment, risk-taking, stress management, compassion, and personal fitness. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3466.656s">For</a>  juniors and seniors in physical education, as you see under sophomore on this slide, we have first aid and CPR, get fit, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3475.068s">lifeguard</a>  training, lifetime activities, outdoor pursuits, team sports, water games, and yoga. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3482.591s">Our</a>  juniors and seniors get to choose what they want to take for physical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3487.712s">And</a>  they take one class junior year and one class in their senior year. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3491.854s">Our</a>  first aid, CPR, and our lifeguard training, you can actually get your certification through taking these courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3499.696s">So</a>  that's a great opportunity for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3502.537s">As</a>  you know, I oversee the pool as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3505.296s">Some</a>  of my guards have taken the class through physical education department and are employed at the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3512.117s">So</a>  that's a great opportunity for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3514.318s">And</a>  for first aid and CPR, we have a lot of students that might work at camps or daycares and things like that part time, and they can actually obtain their certification here at school and get credit for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3524.42s">So</a>  that's a great opportunity as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3528.241s">Get</a>  fit, we do some walking, we do a yoga unit, and we do a lot of different workouts using our fitness center. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3536.25s">outdoor</a>  pursuits, which ones outdoor readiness, hiking and snowshoeing when we do have snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3541.574s">Um,</a>  then we move on to team sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3544.696s">We</a>  have a different team sports game units. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3547.037s">We've</a>  also add some coaching and officiating into that for our students that might be interested in, in that piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3553.582s">Um,</a>  water games was something that we've recently added as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3557.665s">We</a>  do a water safety unit as part of that, a swimming unit, and then we go into different games that can be played in the water and then our yoga. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3567.582s">We</a>  start with introduction, we move into beginner, and then we do actually go into more intermediate yoga exercises as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3574.664s">We</a>  also do a piece of this is a journaling exercise that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3581.126s">At</a>  the end of each class, students journal about how they felt before class, how they felt after class, what might be going on with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3588.889s">It's</a>  just an opportunity for them to kind of reflect to see how class went and how they're feeling at the end, which is a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3596.675s">Um,</a>  you can move on to the next slide on this, um, for assessment for all of these classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3603.678s">Um,</a>  we are doing, um, skill assessment and rubrics for physical education as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3609.881s">Moving</a>  on to professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3612.702s">In</a>  addition to what the district has provided, uh, for professional development, the physical education and health education teachers this year have, um, done CPR certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3623.747s">They,</a>  we just completed that in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3626.355s">And</a>  first aid certification will be completing in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3630.397s">And</a>  they've also taken part in relaxation techniques and self-care. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3635.039s">That</a>  was a presentation by Seth Monk. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3638.641s">I</a>  don't know if any of you remember him. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3639.821s">He's</a>  done presentations for us before to really go over some relaxation techniques that our staff can use to bring to their students, but also use for themselves during everything that's going on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3652.662s">Um,</a>  you can actually move to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3659.003s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3660.284s">Um,</a>  so moving forward, I know in the past we've talked about, um, hiring a middle school health teacher so that we have one in each building. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3668.405s">Um,</a>  so we're, we're looking to add that and to hire adaptive physical education teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3673.306s">We're</a>  also looking to add that still. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3675.587s">We</a>  haven't been able to do that yet under curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3678.467s">Um,</a>  you see, I have reviewing the always changing puberty curriculum with the director of nursing. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3683.509s">And</a>  I also wanted to review the flash curriculum for our special education students to make sure that we are inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3690.075s">Professional</a>  development, we would look to provide some sex education professional development as we, like I spoke about before, the standards have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3700.123s">We</a>  need to maybe get some more training on that and unpack those as well and provide adaptive PE professional development for the entire physical education staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3712.387s">One</a>  more piece I just wanted to add is that, due to the pandemic, the health and physical education curriculum had to be adjusted to meet the needs of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3721.374s">Health</a>  education covered time management skills, stress relief, and things like yoga. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3727.818s">Now</a>  that we're in person, we're coming back to our curriculum set that I showed you here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3735.044s">And</a>  physical education classes were front loaded with lessons that included no equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3739.793s">So</a>  at the beginning, we were doing things like fitness, yoga, relaxation, because kids were at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3745.039s">They</a>  don't necessarily have equipment at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3747.642s">My</a>  teachers did a great job using what they could to get students to be active. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3753.93s">You</a>  can go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3756.433s">I</a>  believe that is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3758.575s">And</a>  I think that's your question slide.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3762.079s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3762.44s">Thank</a>  you, Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3763.601s">Rachel,</a>  I'm going to start off the questioning this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3766.405s">You</a>  did on the last slide hit the most important questions for me right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3772.615s">The</a>  adaptive PE, to what level are we offering and meeting the needs of special education students? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3778.543s">for</a>  instance, autistic students. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3780.985s">And</a>  you mentioned the flash curriculum, is it good for special ed? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3784.447s">But</a>  as we were going through all the class levels, that was exactly what I was curious about. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3789.469s">For</a>  example, if we have a substantially separate high school class that's held at the high school, are those students receiving health education and how is it modified appropriately?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3801.837s">So</a>  we do have some students going into health classes and we do have some students that <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3807.83s">might</a>  be separated for certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3809.271s">It</a>  depends on what their IEP calls for. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3813.653s">We</a>  are adapting our health education units. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3817.396s">We</a>  do use a little bit of units that are lower grades to adapt right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3822.739s">The</a>  flash curriculum is specifically for special education students. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3826.261s">So</a>  I wanted to take a look at that so that we can compare to what we have now to see if that would be a better option for us.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3833.773s">And</a>  is that then an outside curriculum?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3839.455s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3839.715s">It's</a>  an online. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3840.255s">It's</a>  actually a free curriculum.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3842.236s">It's</a>  free? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3843.056s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3843.636s">Music</a>  to my ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3844.857s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3845.597s">I</a>  thought that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3848.178s">Is</a>  there a way? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3849.298s">Could</a>  you send us a link for that so we could see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3851.939s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3852.939s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3855.14s">So</a>  to Jenny or Paul in particular, what questions might you have for Rachel?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3863.563s">I</a>  just had some additional questions about the health curriculum, but I would defer if there's questions about P before we cycle back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3873.629s">Okay,</a>  so. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3878.555s">I</a>  don't feel like I totally, and maybe it's just sort of where I've entered this conversation, but I don't feel like I totally understand when you said we tried this and we liked it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3889.466s">I</a>  don't understand what the methodology was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3892.749s">Did</a>  we try two things and we liked this better? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3896.292s">Do</a>  you think that there would be a change of that opinion when there are dedicated health professionals, particularly at the middle school level rather than guidance Councilors conducting this training? <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3906.577s">I</a>  mean, just overall, like there's just nothing stand out about the description of the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3914.06s">And</a>  maybe that's just the description, I'm not sure, but I'm just curious, like what is so great about this curriculum that we have in place?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3923.564s">So</a>  it is a skills-based model. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3925.59s">And</a>  that's what our national standards call for. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3928.771s">So</a>  we are using a skill-based model and that's what we were looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3932.452s">I</a>  do have designated health teachers that are licensed health teachers teaching it at the high school and one at the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3938.674s">And</a>  they did try it and really liked the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3941.875s">They</a>  did have second step that they were using before this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3946.857s">And</a>  that was very outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3948.457s">And</a>  it was something that was not very easy to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3950.898s">And</a>  it did not address all the skills that <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3954.399s">we</a>  needed to address at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3956.6s">And</a>  that is why we went with the Michigan model. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3958.481s">Like</a>  I said, I did look at what other districts were doing, and this was something that was recommended by other districts as well.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3965.263s">So</a>  Jenny, in the past, in prior years, this was a deep conversation as we were looking at our curriculum and seeing it was not adequate. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3979.849s">And</a>  so there was much discussion about <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3984.41s">looking</a>  at our curriculum and looking at the Michigan model, which sort of rose like the cream to the top and talking about that, getting feedback from our principals and from our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3998.319s">It</a>  was, I would say that it was, you know, it's always important to review curriculum and to make sure they're still meeting our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4006.524s">But</a>  I do want to say that this was something that was, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4010.807s">I</a>  don't know if that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4011.387s">Thoroughly</a>  talked about on the school committee level.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4018.491s">I</a>  just. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4019.672s">This</a>  the scope and sequence seems so. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4023.894s">Slow</a>  to me in terms of like when topics are being covered and I. That is just sort of my reaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4031.999s">I.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4040.647s">There</a>  are fourth grade girls who get their period. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4043.991s">All</a>  of these things, like as long as we might want these <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4053.796s">life</a>  decisions to be put off as adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4058.698s">We</a>  can want that all we want, but it's education's job to prepare students. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4065.161s">And</a>  I don't have a huge comfort level that we're preparing our students as best we could at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4074.765s">That</a>  doesn't mean the curriculum is not capable of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4078.326s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4079.107s">There</a>  is still a huge gap for me that I haven't <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4082.628s">been</a>  able to reconcile based on this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4085.23s">And</a>  I just want to make sure that if there's something that you need to really have us all feel good, and you're the expert, so I care more about what you think than what I think, but I want us to feel like we are being modern in our approach and that we are <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4111.785s">making</a>  sure that we are preparing students for the life that they will live, whether we prepare them or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4119.588s">And</a>  however we need to do that, if that is this curriculum, that's fabulous news, it's already in house, but if there's something else that is needed, I just want us to identify that as quickly as possible so that we can get it in place.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4137.577s">Superintendent?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4139.079s">I</a>  just wanted to say, Memogram, in response to some of your comments, that yes, Michigan model is definitely one of the models that is respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4151.333s">And</a>  again, the fact that it's skills-based in the opening <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4157.1s">Rachel,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4157.62s">Perry</a>  was sharing about following the national standards as opposed to the state standards because the national, the state curriculum, I believe, went back to 99. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4168.205s">It's</a>  in the process of being updated, but it hasn't happened just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4171.867s">So</a>  the state, the national standards are the standards that <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4175.509s">people</a>  should be paying attention to and the fact that it is skill space. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4180.232s">So</a>  I just want you to know that Michigan model is definitely respected for at least being one of the stronger programs out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4190.377s">And</a>  in regards to your second comment about it's true, girls are developing and hitting puberty at younger ages, especially students of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4204.524s">Black</a>  and brown are hitting, students are hitting puberty at exceptionally younger ages. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4212.391s">And</a>  so that is something, but research is also talking about from the health umbrella or health perspective for us also to provide education on the importance of healthy eating because certain foods right now, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4232.367s">people</a>  who aren't medical experts are saying, is it the hormones that's being given to corn or chicken or whatever it is that you're eating, that the hormones are also almost pushing young girls into puberty at much younger and earlier ages. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4254.203s">So</a>  I do think the aspect about healthy eating, healthy lifestyle, <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4261.608s">you</a>  know being active because all of that and you know with the puberty onset of puberty it's also connected to weight so um if there's early obesity and other or signs of that that like one thing can trigger the other which can trigger the other so it it it definitely is something that you know I think we're aware of and we do have to definitely listen to um <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4291.135s">medical</a>  guidance, but I just wanted to let you know that we're aware that there are a lot of factors and how it just is impacting society in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4305.305s">So</a>  I just wanted to add that comment to what you were saying earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4309.829s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4315.032s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4316.233s">Are</a>  there any other questions for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4318.335s">Perry?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4320.645s">Rachel,</a>  Paul, no, Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4325.486s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4326.926s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4327.566s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4327.967s">So</a>  thank you so much, Rachel, and thank you everybody else for attending who's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4331.607s">I</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4333.868s">And</a>  we have a meeting, school committee meeting starting at, what time is it starting, six o'clock?</p>
