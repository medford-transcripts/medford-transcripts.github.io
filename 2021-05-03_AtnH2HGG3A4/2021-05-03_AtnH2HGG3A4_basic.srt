So I'll just talk a little bit about the presentation topics first, then we'll dive right in. First, we're going to talk a little bit about the MAS frameworks. We'll move on to national health education and physical education standards.

16
00:07:39,689 --> 00:08:07,972
And then we'll go into the elementary, middle and high school health curriculum and the physical education curriculum, talk a little bit about professional development and then moving forward 2021 and beyond. Moving to the next slide. And next one. Thank you. So I'm gonna talk a little bit about our program description and then we'll talk about the frameworks.

17
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:33,385
The goal of the Physical Education and Health Education Department of Medford Public Schools is to enhance the well-being of the school community by creating a culture that integrates and balances the six dimensions of wellness, social, physical, intellectual, occupational, emotional, and spiritual. The department strives to encourage an active, healthy lifestyle, healthy decision-making, and a lifelong commitment to wellness.

18
00:08:34,432 --> 00:09:00,892
The Massachusetts state health education and physical education frameworks were last updated in 1999. Since these frameworks are not up to date, Medford Public Schools health education and physical education curriculum are aligned to the physical education, health education, and sexual education national standards. Medford Public Schools health curriculum is based on the seven health education skills.

19
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:30,777
analyzing influences, accessing information, interpersonal communication, decision-making, goal-setting, practicing health-enhancing behaviors, and advocacy. We will revise our curricula to follow updated standards as they are released. You will find links to the state and national standards at the bottom of the slide. Right now, from what I understand, the Department of Education is doing an update and an edit

20
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:57,878
to the frameworks, and then that's going to be put out for public opinion. Then they'll do another edit from there, and then they will be released. I don't know how long those will take, but once we get them, I will unpack them with my staff, and then we'll have to align what we're doing to those standards. Then I imagine I'll be coming before you all again to talk about what those changes are and what changes we need to make in our curriculum. You can go to the next slide, please.

21
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:31,257
Thank you. Health education. So the skills-based Michigan model curriculum is used in grades K to 12. The health curriculum is also supplemented with the catch vaping curriculum and the mentors and violence prevention curriculum at the middle and high schools. Throughout this presentation, you can access the health and physical education scope and sequence by clicking on the grade levels in each slide. We can move to the next slide. Elementary health education.

22
00:10:32,945 --> 00:11:01,835
At the elementary level, the Michigan model social emotional units are taught at each grade level by classroom teachers. Social and emotional learning is a process through which children and adults acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.

23
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:31,670
Goals of an SEL program are to promote students' self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationships, and responsible decision-making skills, and to improve students' attitudes and beliefs about self, others, and school. The social-emotional lessons start off in kindergarten with lessons on showing respect and caring for each other. Students learn how to apply please, thank you,

And that is using the Procter and Gamble always changing curriculum. The assessments we are using in elementary school, part of the Michigan model, we have pre and post tests provided to assess our student learning. Moving on to middle school health, if we can go to the next slide. Thank you. So middle school health is taught by a health teacher and guidance counselors.

35
00:16:45,882 --> 00:17:13,658
Guidance counselors teach the social-emotional learning units at each grade level. And students have half a year of health and half a year of guidance in the middle school for sixth, seventh, and eighth graders. Starting with our sixth grade, I'll go through the units and just briefly describe each unit for you. The first one for sixth grade is drugs, tobacco, and alcohol.

Assessments for middle school health, we are using rubrics and pre and post test provided with a Michigan model curriculum to assess student learning. We can move on to the next slide, I'm gonna be moving on to high school health education. High school health is taught by health teachers and students here at the high school have

61
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:32,108
half a year of health and half a year of physical education every single year. We start off with Freshman Health, which is called Introduction to Health. For freshmen, this course is designed to introduce students to personal health concepts. Topics covered will include mental health awareness, healthy relationships, disease prevention and sexual education. Starting out with

62
00:29:33,863 --> 00:30:03,597
increase social emotional awareness through team building exercises. We do that at the start of every health class in high school, and that helps promote a safe learning environment with clear learning expectations. Students will understand what health and wellness, I'm sorry, the meaning of health and wellness, and begin to evaluate their own personal meaning of what those words mean to them. Students will visually represent the importance of health and wellness through a creation of a vision board to help motivate them to reach health-related goals.

63
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:33,770
Moving on to a mental health lesson. Again, this is also brought through all four years at the high school, so I won't repeat it when I go over the next grades. At this level, students will identify stress, stressors, common causes of stress, side effects of stress, and ways to manage stress. Students will understand coping skills and what skills work for them. And they'll identify solutions to stress management and complete a personal support plan. The reason we do this through all four grades

64
00:30:34,023 --> 00:31:01,192
is stress can change from year to year, what affects them can change from year to year and what works on them can change from year to year. So that's why we introduce it in each year. The next unit here is healthy relationships. Students will describe criteria for selecting friends or potential romantic partners and maintaining healthy relationships. Students will explain the importance of healthy decision-making and relationships, describe different ways to communicate feelings.

65

Topics covered include how to deal with peer pressure, refusal skills, communication skills, drug, alcohol, and tobacco education, basic nutrition, body image, and fitness.

70
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:52,102

Drugs, alcohol, peer pressure, refusal skills, and communication skills is the next unit. They'll describe long and short term consequences of substance use, clarify myths regarding substances,

73
00:34:48,970 --> 00:35:18,012
analyze internal and external pressures to use alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, apply decision-making and problem-solving steps to hypothetical problems related to substances, and demonstrate skills to avoid or resist using these substances. Part of this is also the CATCH curriculum, which is the vaping curriculum that we also used in the middle school. They will review consequences and health hazards, review refusal skills and smart exit strategies to using vapes,

74
00:35:18,485 --> 00:35:46,919
develop a public service announcement that addresses misconceptions while promoting the benefits of being vape free. Moving on to junior health, it's called healthy lifestyles. And this course provides students with the tools needed to live a healthy lifestyle. Topics include stress management, goal setting, advanced nutrition, and consumer health. The goal setting unit, students will understand the components of SMART goals and ways to make goals.

75
00:35:47,341 --> 00:36:17,159
Students will identify steps in an action plan toward meeting a SMART goal, and will create long and short-term goals. Students will understand how to write an effective resume, and students will improve their interviewing skills. Moving on to stress management, students will identify stress, stressors, common causes of stress, side effects of stress, and ways to manage stress. They will understand coping skills and what skills work for them. They will identify barriers and solutions to stress management

76
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:45,442
And they'll identify positive, negative, and neutral coping skills. Students will practice deep breathing and muscle relaxation techniques during this class. Moving on to consumer awareness, students will understand influences to buying behavior, including advertising techniques used to encourage sales. They'll understand how advertisements can be used to target certain groups of individuals. And they'll analyze magazine advertisements for influences on buyer behavior.

77
00:36:46,673 --> 00:37:12,560
Students will understand how advertising biases can influence the information provided in an advertisement. And students will create a print or commercial advertisement during that unit. In advanced nutrition, students will understand relationship between consumer health and nutrition to identify health scams. And students will review and understand MyPlate recommendations for their age group and how to read a food label. They will understand the functions of different macronutrients in the human body.

78
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:41,534
and they will research and explore different diet trends and alternative diet lifestyles. Students will understand what eating disorders are and who they affect and how to manage prevention. Students will do independent research on a specific eating disorder during this unit as well. Moving on to senior health. This course provides students with the skills necessary for the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Topics covered include sexuality,

79
00:37:42,631 --> 00:38:11,183
Violence and conflict resolution. Self-advocacy. Assessing health and community health. Conflict resolution. Students will distinguish the difference between conflict and violence. They will describe the benefits. I'm sorry. Students will learn the effective interpersonal communication skills. They will apply effective communication skills to conflict resolution. And they'll be able to use interpersonal communication skills by creating a conflict resolution role play or skit in order to practice those skills.

80
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:39,348
Accessing information. Students will demonstrate the ability to access valid information or resources in one's community and on the internet related to personal health issues and concerns. Students will be able to identify family medical history and create a family tree. They will demonstrate the ability to access valid information and resources in one's community and on the internet related to personal issues and concerns. Students will describe health practices that can prevent the spread of illness,

81
00:38:39,736 --> 00:39:05,943
identify and understand the factors contributing to affecting one's health, and explain the importance of regular health screenings and exams. Students will apply knowledge about symptoms related to illness to determine if healthcare is needed. Practicing the skill of effective listening, assertive communication, and asking effective questions when accessing health. The last unit for a senior health class is gender and sexuality.

82
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:37,212
Students will build knowledge and understanding of gender, gender stereotypes, and how assumptions can lead to stereotypes and unfair judgments about individuals and or groups. They will have knowledge of gender biases and how they affect our lives. Students will increase knowledge of sexual gender terminology and they'll be able to react to struggles and successes of the LGBTQ community. Students will evaluate the effect of media on gender biases and gender discrimination through advertisements and music.

83
00:39:38,343 --> 00:40:07,216
Assessments, again, for high school health are rubrics and pre and post tests provided with the Michigan model curriculum to assess student learning. And also some of these units included some projects, which would also be an assessment of learning. We can move to the next slide. I think we are on to physical education. Thank you. And if you look at those pages there, those are actually our students. Hi. Rachel, hold on a second.

84
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:14,742
I just thought before we move on, it might be useful to take some questions regarding the health education piece.

85
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:43,328
Is that okay for us to divide it up like that? So if we do divide it that way, we just need to be cognizant of the time because we're at 540. The PE portion will not be, I think it's more self-explanatory so that it will not take as long to give all of the descriptions and we could kind of do the

86
00:40:43,328 --> 00:41:07,375
the, you know, the headers that the key shifts between the grade levels, but I did want to ensure that for the health curriculum that we were thorough in letting, you know, the committee know the progression of health instruction from kindergarten through high school. So that was why, you know, we wanted to make sure that we were very thorough in that.

87
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:36,485
Okay, so are there questions at this time on the health education? What's the preference? Jenny, what would you prefer to do? Do you wanna move on or do you wanna? I think it would make sense to ask some questions now, yeah. Okay, we'll watch the time. It's 5.41. Let's do this like in 10 minutes or so. Okay, so Paul, I see your hand up.

88
00:41:37,058 --> 00:42:04,700
Thank you, yes. So I'm reviewing our presentation from February 25th from last year, you know, just before the end of days started. And I realized that that is the, we have the national standard that you presented, each of the different core concepts and, you know, where they occurred, what grade level. And that presentation is a,

89
00:42:05,088 --> 00:42:33,320
as detailed as this presentation was, that one was far more granular. And I just want to know, you know, some of the things that I didn't hear mentioned were gender identity. I mean, telling seniors about gender identity is sort of, you know, telling an 80 year old about retirement. It's kind of like, yeah, they've heard of it already. And I just want to make sure that, you know, we have it listed that it will be in the six through eight. Are we doing that in six through eight or?

90
00:42:33,927 --> 00:43:03,661
Are we really not talking about it until they could teach us about gender identity? So we talk a little bit in sixth grade about sexuality and gender identity. It's very brief. I do want to make sure you also are aware that the sexuality national guidelines have just changed. So I need to actually unpack those and take a look at what's going on in those as well. And I'll probably have to bring those before you to make any changes.

91
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:32,922
They do, but in sixth grade about sexuality and gender identity. Okay. Cause like in the, I think gender, the only thing I remember from the entire progression was around seniors and, you know, understanding gender and how gender, you know, influences everything. Um, and my, my first reaction was, isn't that for kindergartners and first graders before they have already decided that, no, that's for boys and that's for girls and, um, waiting until their seniors seems,

92
00:43:33,850 --> 00:44:01,897
strangely late, but maybe it's just that it's not in the presentation, right? It's more in depth this senior year. We do touch upon it in sixth grade, but it is more in depth senior. We also touch upon it as freshmen in the sexual, in the sex ed piece. Okay. Um, and then my other question was around, um, you know, I heard a lot of words in the elementary section that are, when I look at the, you know, the various curriculum around the word around consent, um, and,

93
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:31,090
you know, as you know, the having the right language, a consistent language that progresses all the way through so that, you know, you get to middle school and the teachers and staff aren't talking a totally different language. And I didn't hear the word consent. I heard all of the pieces of consent. But, you know, what I read is that we should be teaching consent, obviously not, you know, teach kindergartners around about sexual consent, but about touching and using the word consent so that it's literally

94
00:44:31,765 --> 00:45:00,605
the word they all know and they, it's not foreign to them when it becomes a different thing as they get older. Are we doing that yet? We do that in the elementary school about appropriate touch. Yes, we don't call it consent, but it is appropriate touch. Okay. In having, you know, guidelines and. Yeah. So do we, do we, do we specifically teach positive consent? You know, affirmative consent, I think actually is what it's called. Sorry.

95
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:30,743
just because the girl didn't say no isn't good enough. In middle school, yes. Okay, good. And then my last thing was, I kept hearing, I heard the word abstinence probably 150 times, not 150 times, but I heard it more than any other word, probably three or four times more than any other word. And I obviously don't have any problem with abstinence. I just, it felt a bit like,

96
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:53,002
here's all the bad stuff, as if sex is not a good thing. Everybody on this call is an adult, and I don't know your personal lives, but I'll go out on a limb, and we don't all actually think sex is a bad thing. And do we ever talk about sex in a positive light? So we do promote abstinence.

97
00:45:53,339 --> 00:46:19,124
The age of consent is 16. We do have students that are under 16, and we need to make sure that we are promoting abstinence and that they are aware of the laws and things like that. We do talk about healthy relationships and being with someone you love and that being a positive thing. But we also need to make sure that we are following guidelines, standards, and laws, if that answers your question.

98
00:46:19,748 --> 00:46:48,537
Yeah, it just sounds like we have a curriculum to make parents happy. We don't have one that takes the kids as the primary consideration, which is every health curriculum probably in the entire country. But I mean, I'm not disappointed in you. I'm disappointed in the entire orientation that once you get to college, then you can discover that sex isn't a horrible thing. And all the mental health consequences of teaching our kids

99
00:46:49,094 --> 00:47:18,811
that their bodies are bad for 12 straight years. I'm glad Stacey's not on the call. I guess that's my only other comment. Thank you. OK. Jenny, do you have any questions? I think my question is really about why this curriculum? Why do we think this is the best curriculum out there? Are there better curricula?

100
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:47,549
This, I'm a little taken aback that we're using a video from a consumer product company to teach children about puberty. Like that is a little bit mind-blowing. I also hear that if you are my age and you went to Medford Public Schools, you watched the same video. And I just have to feel like we've progressed beyond this point in 2021. So I, I'm, I, I'm,

101
00:47:48,713 --> 00:48:18,042
struggling with this being the very best representation of what we can deliver for our students. Absolutely. I understand. So that video is not part of the Michigan model that's used in fifth grade. And that is actually on going forward. That's something that I want to work with the director of nursing on to really unpack what that lesson is and look at the national standards and see where our gaps are and how we can do better at that level. So that is not a Michigan model.

102
00:48:18,532 --> 00:48:47,658
And then the Michigan model was chosen because it is a skills-based model. I looked at other area schools and districts to see what they were using. We actually tried it here for a year at each level and our teachers really liked it. So that's why we choose the Michigan model for health because it did encompass everything that we were looking for. Jenny, can I interrupt for a second? Sure. Are we still showing the girls, the girls' videos and the boys, the boys' videos?

103
00:48:48,873 --> 00:49:16,092
I believe they are at the fifth grade level. I would have to confirm that with the nursing department, but I believe they are. And that's, again, something to look at. Yeah, I mean, I think we need to urgently look at that. I mean, the laws of this country are written by men who don't know what women's bodies are. And we're literally reinforcing that. And I think we need to urgently make sure that boys don't think

104
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:32,056
Menstruation is this abomination that can't be mentioned or even taught to them. I mean, we can't wait another year or two years or three years for something that should have been 50 years ago.

105
00:49:33,085 --> 00:49:50,686
Rachel can we, um, is that something that you can send us the videos. Yeah, I can send you the link to it. Perhaps you could share it with, with, with us. So we could see how they're handled. And is that something you're.

106
00:49:51,479 --> 00:50:17,821
that comes under, I mean, nursing, I heard you mention Tony. So where does it fall? So the nurses have been presenting that lesson, not the physical education teachers, although at some schools, I think the male physical education teachers are showing the videos to help out the nurses, but we're not necessarily, it's not in our curriculum. Okay, Susie. That's something we can look at. Susie, I see your hand up, Susanne.

107
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:39,083
I just wanted to clarify to member Rousseau's comment that just in certain situations, the principals work with families when these videos come up. If there are students that are transitioning or transgender, the students are choosing the,

108
00:50:39,590 --> 00:51:02,708
puberty video that they want to participate in and that they relate with. So I just wanted to make that clear. Yes, the nurses typically still give it to the girls and the PE teachers will give it to the boys or they'll separate them out that way. But students are able to choose which video they most relate to.

109
00:51:03,822 --> 00:51:32,358
It certainly would be interesting to see if there is a video which, in fact, addresses all of these questions to the kids at once. I mean, we have come a long way. So I would say that it would make sense for us to look into that right now. Paul? Yeah, I just wanted to add one. I certainly don't have any issues with separating the students out for the videos, if that's what makes sense developmentally.

110
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:58,514
but that they would only see one side of the story of half the human race is the part that I, and I'm really happy to hear that since we are separating them out, that for students that are transitioning, that we are allowing them to pick the one that works best is I think is fabulous. And that if the students are broken out by the binary genders,

111
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:24,400
that that still needs to continue. But the videos they're seeing is sort of was my issue. Thank you. I wanted to ask one question about there used to be a unit on dating violence. And I remember an outside group coming in and make a presentation. Does that still? We have as part of the freshman curriculum, it's mentors and violence prevention.

112
00:52:24,653 --> 00:52:31,437
We actually had our health teachers trained in mentors and violence prevention. So we don't have an outside group come in anymore. So they address those lessons. Yep.

113
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:58,572
Okay, great. Okay, so I think at this point, it makes sense for us to move on to the physical education. And then at the end, if anybody has thought of more questions. And if we have time, we can come back. So if you'd be so kind. I promise this one will be quicker. Alright, so starting with elementary physical education, go to the next slide. There we go.

114
00:52:59,078 --> 00:53:26,129
All right, at the elementary level, our goal is to teach students basic skills and concepts that will enable them to participate in a wide variety of physical activities with success and enjoyment. As basic skills are learned, they apply to a wide variety of games, dance, and fitness activities. You'll notice in each grade level, we have the same units. And as students advance, then move into upper grades, those skills get more difficult.

115
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:54,462
So what we kind of do is group the students into grades K to two, and then three to five. In K to two, we're doing some basic things like locomotor skills, walk, run, skip, hop, leap, jump, manipulative skills, underhand throwing to overhand throwing and catching, dribbling with the feet, controlling the ball, stick handling, volleying a ball, batting a ball off of a tee, stick, I already said stick handling, cooperative games,

116
00:53:54,850 --> 00:54:24,837
We do parachute games, spatial awareness games, fitness, dance, and movement, and yoga. And that's, like I said, at a basic level. When we move on to grades three to five, we incorporate things that are a little bit more difficult. For example, we're refining our locomotor skills and maybe hopping, jumping, skipping over or around things to make things more difficult. We're striking and kicking maybe at a target. We're batting a pitched ball.

117
00:54:25,158 --> 00:54:45,644
Things like that were stick handling and shooting at an object like a net. And we're also incorporating more gameplay. So that is the basis of our elementary physical education curriculum. And if you want, if you can go through each one of those and read exactly what's done in each grade level.

118
00:54:46,117 --> 00:55:08,240
Moving on to middle school. So the next slide. Thank you. The middle school physical education curriculum program builds upon the knowledge and skills that are practicing grades K to five. Our goal is to teach more advanced skills and concepts that will allow students to continue to improve and grow their skill base. You'll notice the same units again in all middle school grades.

119
00:55:08,408 --> 00:55:34,649
However, skills are more advanced as the students move into upper grades. You can read it, but I'm going to give you a couple of different examples, and then I'll move on to high school so that you guys have that time. I know you have another meeting. For example, when we look at target games, bowling and pinball, in sixth grade, we'll go over the history and the three-step approach. The next year, we'll review the history, and we'll go over scoring.

120
00:55:35,206 --> 00:56:01,261
In eighth grade, we'll go over a five-step approach, scoring, and a strike and a spare. So we have extended among that basic information. Invasion games, for example, soccer, we'll start with passing, trapping, and dribbling along with history. Then we'll go on to shooting, defense, and 5v5 soccer. Moving into eighth grade, where we're going to go 5v5 to 7v7 soccer.

121
00:56:01,463 --> 00:56:29,324
teaching students to move to open spaces and giving goes and strategies like that. So that's woven throughout the entire middle school curriculum. We start basic and then we move on to what they should be doing in eighth grade. These are also based on our national standards. So you can see the standard for each grade and where students should be. And that goes on throughout the two things that were added recently to our middle school curriculum were dance and yoga.

122
00:56:29,662 --> 00:56:54,805
Those were the things that we really didn't have much of so that we wanted to make sure that we were following all of the standards and those were the things that we added. So we can go to the next slide. We're going to move on to high school physical education. No, I think you clicked on one of the links, yeah.

123
00:56:56,459 --> 00:57:22,683
All right, high school physical education program builds upon the knowledge and skills taught at the elementary and middle schools. The freshman physical education curriculum is fitness based and allows students to learn about the five components of fitness, fitness testing, how to improve fitness and how to set up their own fitness routine. What we've added to our freshman physical education recently is how to stay safe in and around water and basic swim techniques.

124
00:57:25,163 --> 00:57:54,661
A sophomore physical education, which is called wellness activities. This course is designed to introduce the student to the seven dimensions of wellness and students learn about dimensions of wellness by participating in activities that address leadership, decision-making, commitment, risk-taking, stress management, compassion, and personal fitness. For juniors and seniors in physical education, as you see under sophomore on this slide, we have first aid and CPR, get fit,

125
00:57:54,948 --> 00:58:24,698
lifeguard training, lifetime activities, outdoor pursuits, team sports, water games, and yoga. Our juniors and seniors get to choose what they want to take for physical education. And they take one class junior year and one class in their senior year. Our first aid, CPR, and our lifeguard training, you can actually get your certification through taking these courses. So that's a great opportunity for our students. As you know, I oversee the pool as well.

126
00:58:25,036 --> 00:58:54,922
Some of my guards have taken the class through physical education department and are employed at the pool. So that's a great opportunity for them. And for first aid and CPR, we have a lot of students that might work at camps or daycares and things like that part time, and they can actually obtain their certification here at school and get credit for it. So that's a great opportunity as well. Get fit, we do some walking, we do a yoga unit, and we do a lot of different workouts using our fitness center.

127
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:25,550
outdoor pursuits, which ones outdoor readiness, hiking and snowshoeing when we do have snow. Um, then we move on to team sports. We have a different team sports game units. We've also add some coaching and officiating into that for our students that might be interested in, in that piece. Um, water games was something that we've recently added as well. We do a water safety unit as part of that, a swimming unit, and then we go into different games that can be played in the water and then our yoga.

128
00:59:25,921 --> 00:59:55,891
We start with introduction, we move into beginner, and then we do actually go into more intermediate yoga exercises as well. We also do a piece of this is a journaling exercise that we're doing. At the end of each class, students journal about how they felt before class, how they felt after class, what might be going on with them. It's just an opportunity for them to kind of reflect to see how class went and how they're feeling at the end, which is a great opportunity.

129
00:59:56,515 --> 01:00:25,928
Um, you can move on to the next slide on this, um, for assessment for all of these classes. Um, we are doing, um, skill assessment and rubrics for physical education as well. Moving on to professional development. In addition to what the district has provided, uh, for professional development, the physical education and health education teachers this year have, um, done CPR certification. They, we just completed that in March.

130
01:00:26,215 --> 01:00:51,967
And first aid certification will be completing in June. And they've also taken part in relaxation techniques and self-care. That was a presentation by Seth Monk. I don't know if any of you remember him. He's done presentations for us before to really go over some relaxation techniques that our staff can use to bring to their students, but also use for themselves during everything that's going on right now.

131
01:00:52,422 --> 01:01:22,308
Um, you can actually move to the next slide. Thank you. Um, so moving forward, I know in the past we've talked about, um, hiring a middle school health teacher so that we have one in each building. Um, so we're, we're looking to add that and to hire adaptive physical education teacher. We're also looking to add that still. We haven't been able to do that yet under curriculum. Um, you see, I have reviewing the always changing puberty curriculum with the director of nursing.

132
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:51,552
And I also wanted to review the flash curriculum for our special education students to make sure that we are inclusive. Professional development, we would look to provide some sex education professional development as we, like I spoke about before, the standards have changed. We need to maybe get some more training on that and unpack those as well and provide adaptive PE professional development for the entire physical education staff.

133
01:01:52,227 --> 01:02:19,447
One more piece I just wanted to add is that, due to the pandemic, the health and physical education curriculum had to be adjusted to meet the needs of our students. Health education covered time management skills, stress relief, and things like yoga. Now that we're in person, we're coming back to our curriculum set that I showed you here today. And physical education classes were front loaded with lessons that included no equipment.

134
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:40,017
So at the beginning, we were doing things like fitness, yoga, relaxation, because kids were at home. They don't necessarily have equipment at home. My teachers did a great job using what they could to get students to be active. You can go to the next slide. I believe that is it. And I think that's your question slide.

135
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:58,343
Great. Thank you, Rachel. Rachel, I'm going to start off the questioning this time. You did on the last slide hit the most important questions for me right now. The adaptive PE, to what level are we offering and meeting the needs of special education students?

136
01:02:58,343 --> 01:03:27,520
for instance, autistic students. And you mentioned the flash curriculum, is it good for special ed? But as we were going through all the class levels, that was exactly what I was curious about. For example, if we have a substantially separate high school class that's held at the high school, are those students receiving health education and how is it modified appropriately? So we do have some students going into health classes and we do have some students that

137
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:52,985
might be separated for certain things. It depends on what their IEP calls for. We are adapting our health education units. We do use a little bit of units that are lower grades to adapt right now. The flash curriculum is specifically for special education students. So I wanted to take a look at that so that we can compare to what we have now to see if that would be a better option for us.

138
01:03:53,693 --> 01:04:21,402
And is that then an outside curriculum? It is. It's an online. It's actually a free curriculum. It's free? Yes. Music to my ears. Yes. I thought that would be. Is there a way? Could you send us a link for that so we could see that? Absolutely. OK. So to Jenny or Paul in particular, what questions might you have for Rachel?

139
01:04:23,123 --> 01:04:37,231
I just had some additional questions about the health curriculum, but I would defer if there's questions about P before we cycle back there. Okay, so.

140
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:56,232
I don't feel like I totally, and maybe it's just sort of where I've entered this conversation, but I don't feel like I totally understand when you said we tried this and we liked it. I don't understand what the methodology was there. Did we try two things and we liked this better?

141
01:04:56,232 --> 01:05:25,325
Do you think that there would be a change of that opinion when there are dedicated health professionals, particularly at the middle school level rather than guidance counselors conducting this training? I mean, just overall, like there's just nothing stand out about the description of the curriculum. And maybe that's just the description, I'm not sure, but I'm just curious, like what is so great about this curriculum that we have in place? So it is a skills-based model.

142
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:53,759
And that's what our national standards call for. So we are using a skill-based model and that's what we were looking for. I do have designated health teachers that are licensed health teachers teaching it at the high school and one at the middle school. And they did try it and really liked the curriculum. They did have second step that they were using before this. And that was very outdated. And it was something that was not very easy to follow. And it did not address all the skills that

143
01:05:54,299 --> 01:06:23,830
we needed to address at that time. And that is why we went with the Michigan model. Like I said, I did look at what other districts were doing, and this was something that was recommended by other districts as well. So Jenny, in the past, in prior years, this was a deep conversation as we were looking at our curriculum and seeing it was not adequate. And so there was much discussion about

144
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:50,527
looking at our curriculum and looking at the Michigan model, which sort of rose like the cream to the top and talking about that, getting feedback from our principals and from our teachers. It was, I would say that it was, you know, it's always important to review curriculum and to make sure they're still meeting our needs. But I do want to say that this was something that was,

145
01:06:50,527 --> 01:07:19,383
I don't know if that is. Thoroughly talked about on the school committee level. I just. This the scope and sequence seems so. Slow to me in terms of like when topics are being covered and I. That is just sort of my reaction. I.

146
01:07:20,547 --> 01:07:33,423
There are fourth grade girls who get their period. All of these things, like as long as we might want these

147
01:07:33,676 --> 01:08:02,448
life decisions to be put off as adults. We can want that all we want, but it's education's job to prepare students. And I don't have a huge comfort level that we're preparing our students as best we could at the moment. That doesn't mean the curriculum is not capable of that. I don't know. There is still a huge gap for me that I haven't

148
01:08:02,448 --> 01:08:30,764
been able to reconcile based on this conversation. And I just want to make sure that if there's something that you need to really have us all feel good, and you're the expert, so I care more about what you think than what I think, but I want us to feel like we are being modern in our approach and that we are

149
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:56,954
making sure that we are preparing students for the life that they will live, whether we prepare them or not. And however we need to do that, if that is this curriculum, that's fabulous news, it's already in house, but if there's something else that is needed, I just want us to identify that as quickly as possible so that we can get it in place.

150
01:08:57,477 --> 01:09:16,900
Superintendent? I just wanted to say, Memogram, in response to some of your comments, that yes, Michigan model is definitely one of the models that is respected. And again, the fact that it's skills-based in the opening

151
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:35,429
Rachel, Ms. Perry was sharing about following the national standards as opposed to the state standards because the national, the state curriculum, I believe, went back to 99. It's in the process of being updated, but it hasn't happened just yet. So the state, the national standards are the standards that

152
01:09:35,429 --> 01:10:04,184
people should be paying attention to and the fact that it is skill space. So I just want you to know that Michigan model is definitely respected for at least being one of the stronger programs out there. And in regards to your second comment about it's true, girls are developing and hitting puberty at younger ages, especially students of color.

153
01:10:04,184 --> 01:10:32,247
Black and brown are hitting, students are hitting puberty at exceptionally younger ages. And so that is something, but research is also talking about from the health umbrella or health perspective for us also to provide education on the importance of healthy eating because certain foods right now, you know,

154
01:10:32,247 --> 01:11:01,508
people who aren't medical experts are saying, is it the hormones that's being given to corn or chicken or whatever it is that you're eating, that the hormones are also almost pushing young girls into puberty at much younger and earlier ages. So I do think the aspect about healthy eating, healthy lifestyle,

155
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:30,955
you know being active because all of that and you know with the puberty onset of puberty it's also connected to weight so um if there's early obesity and other or signs of that that like one thing can trigger the other which can trigger the other so it it it definitely is something that you know I think we're aware of and we do have to definitely listen to um

156
01:11:30,955 --> 01:11:58,715
medical guidance, but I just wanted to let you know that we're aware that there are a lot of factors and how it just is impacting society in general. So I just wanted to add that comment to what you were saying earlier. Thank you. Okay. Are there any other questions for Ms. Perry?

157
01:12:00,605 --> 01:12:25,090
Rachel, Paul, no, Jenny. Okay. Great. Okay. So thank you so much, Rachel, and thank you everybody else for attending who's here. I really appreciate it. And we have a meeting, school committee meeting starting at, what time is it starting, six o'clock? Seven o'clock. Seven o'clock.

158
01:12:26,204 --> 01:12:39,772
Great. So we'll see you all at seven o'clock. Thank you so much. Motion to adjourn. Motion to adjourn. Motion to adjourn. Second. Paul Russo? Yes. Jenny Graham? Yes. Paulette VanderKloop? Yes.
