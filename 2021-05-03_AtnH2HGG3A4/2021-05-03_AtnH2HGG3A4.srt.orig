12
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,005

[SPEAKER_05]: Read the paragraph.

23
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:42,543

24
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:48,108
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have thought about something more clever, but I don't think any of us ever perceived we'd be reading it this long.

77
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:34,073
[SPEAKER_02]: First, we're going to talk a little bit about the MAS frameworks.

78
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:38,837
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll move on to national health education and physical education standards.

79
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:53,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll go into the elementary, middle and high school health curriculum and the physical education curriculum, talk a little bit about professional development and then moving forward 2021 and beyond.

00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:54,801

81
00:07:57,984 --> 00:07:58,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And next one.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

83
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:07,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna talk a little bit about our program description and then we'll talk about the frameworks.

84
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:25,280
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal of the Physical Education and Health Education Department of Medford Public Schools is to enhance the well-being of the school community by creating a culture that integrates and balances the six dimensions of wellness, social, physical, intellectual, occupational, emotional, and spiritual.

85
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:33,225
[SPEAKER_02]: The department strives to encourage an active, healthy lifestyle, healthy decision-making, and a lifelong commitment to wellness.

86
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:40,316
[SPEAKER_02]: The Massachusetts state health education and physical education frameworks were last updated in 1999.

87
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:54,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Since these frameworks are not up to date, Medford Public Schools health education and physical education curriculum are aligned to the physical education, health education, and sexual education national standards.

88
00:08:55,708 --> 00:09:00,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Public Schools health curriculum is based on the seven health education skills.

[SPEAKER_02]: analyzing influences, accessing information, interpersonal communication, decision-making, goal-setting, practicing health-enhancing behaviors, and advocacy.

90
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:18,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We will revise our curricula to follow updated standards as they are released.

91
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:22,590

92
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:30,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, from what I understand, the Department of Education is doing an update and an edit

93
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,503
[SPEAKER_02]: to the frameworks, and then that's going to be put out for public opinion.

94
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:38,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they'll do another edit from there, and then they will be released.

95
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:47,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how long those will take, but once we get them, I will unpack them with my staff, and then we'll have to align what we're doing to those standards.

96
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:55,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I imagine I'll be coming before you all again to talk about what those changes are and what changes we need to make in our curriculum.

97
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:57,798

363
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:04,015

364
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:04,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

365
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:06,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Rachel, hold on a second.

366
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:14,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought before we move on, it might be useful to take some questions regarding the health education piece.

367
00:40:17,747 --> 00:40:20,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that okay for us to divide it up like that?

368
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:27,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we do divide it that way, we just need to be cognizant of the time because we're at 540.

369
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:42,467
[SPEAKER_04]: The PE portion will not be, I think it's more self-explanatory so that it will not take as long to give all of the descriptions and we could kind of do the

370
00:40:43,448 --> 00:41:01,953
[SPEAKER_04]: the, you know, the headers that the key shifts between the grade levels, but I did want to ensure that for the health curriculum that we were thorough in letting, you know, the committee know the progression of health instruction from kindergarten through high school.

371
00:41:02,414 --> 00:41:07,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was why, you know, we wanted to make sure that we were very thorough in that.

372
00:41:08,735 --> 00:41:12,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so are there questions at this time on the health education?

373
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:15,457
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the preference?

374
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:17,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, what would you prefer to do?

375
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:18,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you wanna move on or do you wanna?

376
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:24,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would make sense to ask some questions now, yeah.

377
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we'll watch the time.

378
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:28,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 5.41.

379
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:31,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do this like in 10 minutes or so.

380
00:41:32,263 --> 00:41:36,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Paul, I see your hand up.

381
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:37,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, yes.

382
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:46,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm reviewing our presentation from February 25th from last year, you know, just before the end of days started.

383
00:41:47,266 --> 00:42:01,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that that is the, we have the national standard that you presented, each of the different core concepts and, you know, where they occurred, what grade level.

384
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:04,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And that presentation is a,

385
00:42:05,328 --> 00:42:09,850
[SPEAKER_01]: as detailed as this presentation was, that one was far more granular.

386
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:15,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to know, you know, some of the things that I didn't hear mentioned were gender identity.

387
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:21,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, telling seniors about gender identity is sort of, you know, telling an 80 year old about retirement.

388
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:24,316
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, yeah, they've heard of it already.

389
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:30,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to make sure that, you know, we have it listed that it will be in the six through eight.

390
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:33,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing that in six through eight or?

391
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:39,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we really not talking about it until they could teach us about gender identity?

392
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,552
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk a little bit in sixth grade about sexuality and gender identity.

393
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:45,012
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very brief.

394
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:52,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to make sure you also are aware that the sexuality national guidelines have just changed.

395
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:58,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to actually unpack those and take a look at what's going on in those as well.

396
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:03,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll probably have to bring those before you to make any changes.

397
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:07,435
[SPEAKER_02]: They do, but in sixth grade about sexuality and gender identity.

398
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:08,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

399
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:20,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like in the, I think gender, the only thing I remember from the entire progression was around seniors and, you know, understanding gender and how gender, you know, influences everything.

400
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:32,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and my, my first reaction was, isn't that for kindergartners and first graders before they have already decided that, no, that's for boys and that's for girls and, um, waiting until their seniors seems,

401
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,331
[SPEAKER_01]: strangely late, but maybe it's just that it's not in the presentation, right?

402
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:40,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more in depth this senior year.

403
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:42,932
[SPEAKER_02]: We do touch upon it in sixth grade, but it is more in depth senior.

404
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:47,873
[SPEAKER_02]: We also touch upon it as freshmen in the sexual, in the sex ed piece.

405
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:48,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

406
00:43:49,354 --> 00:44:01,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then my other question was around, um, you know, I heard a lot of words in the elementary section that are, when I look at the, you know, the various curriculum around the word around consent, um, and,

407
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:12,218
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as you know, the having the right language, a consistent language that progresses all the way through so that, you know, you get to middle school and the teachers and staff aren't talking a totally different language.

408
00:44:12,938 --> 00:44:14,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't hear the word consent.

409
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:17,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard all of the pieces of consent.

410
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:30,970
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, what I read is that we should be teaching consent, obviously not, you know, teach kindergartners around about sexual consent, but about touching and using the word consent so that it's literally

411
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:38,530
[SPEAKER_01]: the word they all know and they, it's not foreign to them when it becomes a different thing as they get older.

412
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing that yet?

413
00:44:41,752 --> 00:44:44,634
[SPEAKER_02]: We do that in the elementary school about appropriate touch.

414
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:48,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we don't call it consent, but it is appropriate touch.

415
00:44:49,637 --> 00:44:49,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

416
00:44:50,018 --> 00:44:51,659
[SPEAKER_02]: In having, you know, guidelines and.

417
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

418
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So do we, do we, do we specifically teach positive consent?

419
00:44:58,343 --> 00:45:00,245
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, affirmative consent, I think actually is what it's called.

420
00:45:00,285 --> 00:45:00,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

421
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,636
[SPEAKER_01]: just because the girl didn't say no isn't good enough.

422
00:45:05,096 --> 00:45:06,296
[SPEAKER_02]: In middle school, yes.

423
00:45:06,977 --> 00:45:07,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

424
00:45:08,017 --> 00:45:24,421
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my last thing was, I kept hearing, I heard the word abstinence probably 150 times, not 150 times, but I heard it more than any other word, probably three or four times more than any other word.

425
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:28,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And I obviously don't have any problem with abstinence.

426
00:45:28,122 --> 00:45:30,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it felt a bit like,

427
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,692
[SPEAKER_01]: here's all the bad stuff, as if sex is not a good thing.

428
00:45:36,373 --> 00:45:43,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody on this call is an adult, and I don't know your personal lives, but I'll go out on a limb, and we don't all actually think sex is a bad thing.

429
00:45:44,697 --> 00:45:47,379
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we ever talk about sex in a positive light?

430
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,661
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do promote abstinence.

431
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:55,179
[SPEAKER_02]: The age of consent is 16.

432
00:45:55,219 --> 00:46:03,261
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have students that are under 16, and we need to make sure that we are promoting abstinence and that they are aware of the laws and things like that.

433
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:10,282
[SPEAKER_02]: We do talk about healthy relationships and being with someone you love and that being a positive thing.

434
00:46:10,522 --> 00:46:19,064
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also need to make sure that we are following guidelines, standards, and laws, if that answers your question.

435
00:46:19,868 --> 00:46:23,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just sounds like we have a curriculum to make parents happy.

436
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:31,952
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have one that takes the kids as the primary consideration, which is every health curriculum probably in the entire country.

437
00:46:32,032 --> 00:46:35,253
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I'm not disappointed in you.

438
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:42,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm disappointed in the entire orientation that once you get to college, then you can discover that sex isn't a horrible thing.

439
00:46:44,256 --> 00:46:48,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the mental health consequences of teaching our kids

440
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:53,436
[SPEAKER_01]: that their bodies are bad for 12 straight years.

441
00:46:56,698 --> 00:46:59,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad Stacey's not on the call.

442
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's my only other comment.

443
00:47:02,382 --> 00:47:02,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

444
00:47:02,762 --> 00:47:02,842
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

445
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:04,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, do you have any questions?

446
00:47:07,104 --> 00:47:11,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I think my question is really about why this curriculum?

447
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:13,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do we think this is the best curriculum out there?

448
00:47:13,688 --> 00:47:18,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there better curricula?

449
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:27,518
[SPEAKER_06]: This, I'm a little taken aback that we're using a video from a consumer product company to teach children about puberty.

450
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:29,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that is a little bit mind-blowing.

451
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I also hear that if you are my age and you went to Medford Public Schools, you watched the same video.

452
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:41,466
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just have to feel like we've progressed beyond this point in 2021.

453
00:47:41,506 --> 00:47:42,646
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, I'm, I, I'm,

454
00:47:48,813 --> 00:47:56,755
[SPEAKER_06]: struggling with this being the very best representation of what we can deliver for our students.

455
00:47:57,496 --> 00:47:57,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

456
00:47:57,956 --> 00:47:58,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.

457
00:47:58,496 --> 00:48:02,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So that video is not part of the Michigan model that's used in fifth grade.

458
00:48:02,677 --> 00:48:05,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is actually on going forward.

459
00:48:05,278 --> 00:48:15,961
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that I want to work with the director of nursing on to really unpack what that lesson is and look at the national standards and see where our gaps are and how we can do better at that level.

460
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:17,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is not a Michigan model.

461
00:48:19,672 --> 00:48:23,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Michigan model was chosen because it is a skills-based model.

462
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:28,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at other area schools and districts to see what they were using.

463
00:48:28,714 --> 00:48:34,395
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually tried it here for a year at each level and our teachers really liked it.

464
00:48:34,455 --> 00:48:38,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we choose the Michigan model for health because it did encompass everything that we were looking for.

465
00:48:40,577 --> 00:48:41,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny, can I interrupt for a second?

466
00:48:42,177 --> 00:48:43,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

467
00:48:44,097 --> 00:48:47,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we still showing the girls, the girls' videos and the boys, the boys' videos?

468
00:48:48,953 --> 00:48:50,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they are at the fifth grade level.

469
00:48:50,774 --> 00:48:54,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to confirm that with the nursing department, but I believe they are.

470
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:57,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, again, something to look at.

471
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think we need to urgently look at that.

472
00:49:01,842 --> 00:49:07,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the laws of this country are written by men who don't know what women's bodies are.

473
00:49:08,086 --> 00:49:11,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're literally reinforcing that.

474
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:16,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to urgently make sure that boys don't think

475
00:49:17,202 --> 00:49:21,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Menstruation is this abomination that can't be mentioned or even taught to them.

476
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:30,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can't wait another year or two years or three years for something that should have been 50 years ago.

477
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:38,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Rachel can we, um, is that something that you can send us the videos.

478
00:49:39,032 --> 00:49:40,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can send you the link to it.

479
00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:44,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps you could share it with, with, with us.

480
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,483
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could see how they're handled.

481
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:49,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that something you're.

482
00:49:51,479 --> 00:49:55,342
[SPEAKER_05]: that comes under, I mean, nursing, I heard you mention Tony.

483
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:56,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So where does it fall?

484
00:49:57,404 --> 00:50:10,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So the nurses have been presenting that lesson, not the physical education teachers, although at some schools, I think the male physical education teachers are showing the videos to help out the nurses, but we're not necessarily, it's not in our curriculum.

485
00:50:11,316 --> 00:50:11,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Susie.

486
00:50:11,936 --> 00:50:13,177
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something we can look at.

487
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:17,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Susie, I see your hand up, Susanne.

488
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:30,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to clarify to member Rousseau's comment that just in certain situations, the principals work with families when these videos come up.

489
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:37,602
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are students that are transitioning or transgender, the students are choosing the,

490
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:47,016
[SPEAKER_03]: puberty video that they want to participate in and that they relate with.

491
00:50:47,316 --> 00:50:48,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to make that clear.

492
00:50:49,278 --> 00:50:57,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the nurses typically still give it to the girls and the PE teachers will give it to the boys or they'll separate them out that way.

493
00:50:58,265 --> 00:51:02,368
[SPEAKER_03]: But students are able to choose which video they most relate to.

494
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:12,027
[SPEAKER_05]: It certainly would be interesting to see if there is a video which, in fact, addresses all of these questions to the kids at once.

495
00:51:12,107 --> 00:51:14,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have come a long way.

496
00:51:14,468 --> 00:51:20,611
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say that it would make sense for us to look into that right now.

497
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:21,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul?

498
00:51:22,653 --> 00:51:23,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to add one.

499
00:51:23,913 --> 00:51:31,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly don't have any issues with separating the students out for the videos, if that's what makes sense developmentally.

500
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:51,670
[SPEAKER_01]: but that they would only see one side of the story of half the human race is the part that I, and I'm really happy to hear that since we are separating them out, that for students that are transitioning, that we are allowing them to pick the one that works best is I think is fabulous.

501
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:57,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And that if the students are broken out by the binary genders,

502
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,022
[SPEAKER_01]: that that still needs to continue.

503
00:52:01,382 --> 00:52:04,684
[SPEAKER_01]: But the videos they're seeing is sort of was my issue.

504
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:06,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

505
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:11,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to ask one question about there used to be a unit on dating violence.

506
00:52:12,871 --> 00:52:15,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember an outside group coming in and make a presentation.

507
00:52:15,573 --> 00:52:16,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that still?

508
00:52:18,455 --> 00:52:24,280
[SPEAKER_02]: We have as part of the freshman curriculum, it's mentors and violence prevention.

509
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:28,065
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had our health teachers trained in mentors and violence prevention.

510
00:52:28,085 --> 00:52:29,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have an outside group come in anymore.

511
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:31,036
[SPEAKER_02]: So they address those lessons.

512
00:52:31,156 --> 00:52:31,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

513
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:32,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

514
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:39,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I think at this point, it makes sense for us to move on to the physical education.

515
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:41,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the end, if anybody has thought of more questions.

516
00:52:41,403 --> 00:52:43,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we have time, we can come back.

517
00:52:43,724 --> 00:52:44,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you'd be so kind.

518
00:52:46,025 --> 00:52:47,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise this one will be quicker.

519
00:52:49,887 --> 00:52:54,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so starting with elementary physical education, go to the next slide.

520
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:58,452
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

521
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:09,542
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, at the elementary level, our goal is to teach students basic skills and concepts that will enable them to participate in a wide variety of physical activities with success and enjoyment.

522
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:15,685
[SPEAKER_02]: As basic skills are learned, they apply to a wide variety of games, dance, and fitness activities.

523
00:53:16,145 --> 00:53:19,646
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice in each grade level, we have the same units.

524
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:25,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And as students advance, then move into upper grades, those skills get more difficult.

525
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:31,935
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we kind of do is group the students into grades K to two, and then three to five.

526
00:53:32,595 --> 00:53:54,322
[SPEAKER_02]: In K to two, we're doing some basic things like locomotor skills, walk, run, skip, hop, leap, jump, manipulative skills, underhand throwing to overhand throwing and catching, dribbling with the feet, controlling the ball, stick handling, volleying a ball, batting a ball off of a tee, stick, I already said stick handling, cooperative games,

527
00:53:54,870 --> 00:54:00,711
[SPEAKER_02]: We do parachute games, spatial awareness games, fitness, dance, and movement, and yoga.

528
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, like I said, at a basic level.

529
00:54:03,552 --> 00:54:09,493
[SPEAKER_02]: When we move on to grades three to five, we incorporate things that are a little bit more difficult.

530
00:54:09,934 --> 00:54:17,355
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, we're refining our locomotor skills and maybe hopping, jumping, skipping over or around things to make things more difficult.

531
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:20,576
[SPEAKER_02]: We're striking and kicking maybe at a target.

532
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:24,637
[SPEAKER_02]: We're batting a pitched ball.

533
00:54:25,158 --> 00:54:30,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like that were stick handling and shooting at an object like a net.

534
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also incorporating more gameplay.

535
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:39,662
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the basis of our elementary physical education curriculum.

536
00:54:40,002 --> 00:54:45,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want, if you can go through each one of those and read exactly what's done in each grade level.

537
00:54:46,177 --> 00:54:47,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to middle school.

538
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next slide.

539
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:50,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

540
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:57,989
[SPEAKER_02]: The middle school physical education curriculum program builds upon the knowledge and skills that are practicing grades K to five.

541
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:04,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to teach more advanced skills and concepts that will allow students to continue to improve and grow their skill base.

542
00:55:05,117 --> 00:55:08,120
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice the same units again in all middle school grades.

543
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:11,811
[SPEAKER_02]: However, skills are more advanced as the students move into upper grades.

544
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:20,097
[SPEAKER_02]: You can read it, but I'm going to give you a couple of different examples, and then I'll move on to high school so that you guys have that time.

545
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:20,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you have another meeting.

546
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:29,925
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, when we look at target games, bowling and pinball, in sixth grade, we'll go over the history and the three-step approach.

547
00:55:30,546 --> 00:55:34,589
[SPEAKER_02]: The next year, we'll review the history, and we'll go over scoring.

548
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:39,649
[SPEAKER_02]: In eighth grade, we'll go over a five-step approach, scoring, and a strike and a spare.

549
00:55:40,089 --> 00:55:44,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have extended among that basic information.

550
00:55:45,352 --> 00:55:51,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Invasion games, for example, soccer, we'll start with passing, trapping, and dribbling along with history.

551
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:56,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'll go on to shooting, defense, and 5v5 soccer.

552
00:55:56,778 --> 00:55:59,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving into eighth grade, where we're going to go 5v5 to 7v7 soccer.

553
00:56:01,523 --> 00:56:06,167
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching students to move to open spaces and giving goes and strategies like that.

554
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:10,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's woven throughout the entire middle school curriculum.

555
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,613
[SPEAKER_02]: We start basic and then we move on to what they should be doing in eighth grade.

556
00:56:15,093 --> 00:56:17,595
[SPEAKER_02]: These are also based on our national standards.

557
00:56:17,615 --> 00:56:20,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the standard for each grade and where students should be.

558
00:56:22,439 --> 00:56:29,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes on throughout the two things that were added recently to our middle school curriculum were dance and yoga.

559
00:56:29,902 --> 00:56:36,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the things that we really didn't have much of so that we wanted to make sure that we were following all of the standards and those were the things that we added.

560
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can go to the next slide.

561
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:42,674
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to move on to high school physical education.

562
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:54,305
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think you clicked on one of the links, yeah.

563
00:56:56,499 --> 00:57:02,224
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, high school physical education program builds upon the knowledge and skills taught at the elementary and middle schools.

564
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:13,655
[SPEAKER_02]: The freshman physical education curriculum is fitness based and allows students to learn about the five components of fitness, fitness testing, how to improve fitness and how to set up their own fitness routine.

565
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:22,523
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've added to our freshman physical education recently is how to stay safe in and around water and basic swim techniques.

566
00:57:25,223 --> 00:57:28,865
[SPEAKER_02]: A sophomore physical education, which is called wellness activities.

567
00:57:29,306 --> 00:57:44,095
[SPEAKER_02]: This course is designed to introduce the student to the seven dimensions of wellness and students learn about dimensions of wellness by participating in activities that address leadership, decision-making, commitment, risk-taking, stress management, compassion, and personal fitness.

568
00:57:46,656 --> 00:57:54,621
[SPEAKER_02]: For juniors and seniors in physical education, as you see under sophomore on this slide, we have first aid and CPR, get fit,

569
00:57:55,068 --> 00:58:01,690
[SPEAKER_02]: lifeguard training, lifetime activities, outdoor pursuits, team sports, water games, and yoga.

570
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:06,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Our juniors and seniors get to choose what they want to take for physical education.

571
00:58:07,712 --> 00:58:11,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And they take one class junior year and one class in their senior year.

572
00:58:11,854 --> 00:58:19,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first aid, CPR, and our lifeguard training, you can actually get your certification through taking these courses.

573
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:21,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great opportunity for our students.

574
00:58:22,537 --> 00:58:23,998
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, I oversee the pool as well.

575
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:32,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my guards have taken the class through physical education department and are employed at the pool.

576
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:33,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great opportunity for them.

577
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:44,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And for first aid and CPR, we have a lot of students that might work at camps or daycares and things like that part time, and they can actually obtain their certification here at school and get credit for it.

578
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great opportunity as well.

579
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:53,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Get fit, we do some walking, we do a yoga unit, and we do a lot of different workouts using our fitness center.

580
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:00,933
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor pursuits, which ones outdoor readiness, hiking and snowshoeing when we do have snow.

581
00:59:01,574 --> 00:59:04,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then we move on to team sports.

582
00:59:04,696 --> 00:59:06,997
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a different team sports game units.

583
00:59:07,037 --> 00:59:12,761
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also add some coaching and officiating into that for our students that might be interested in, in that piece.

584
00:59:13,582 --> 00:59:17,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, water games was something that we've recently added as well.

585
00:59:17,665 --> 00:59:25,370
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a water safety unit as part of that, a swimming unit, and then we go into different games that can be played in the water and then our yoga.

586
00:59:27,582 --> 00:59:34,284
[SPEAKER_02]: We start with introduction, we move into beginner, and then we do actually go into more intermediate yoga exercises as well.

587
00:59:34,664 --> 00:59:40,026
[SPEAKER_02]: We also do a piece of this is a journaling exercise that we're doing.

588
00:59:41,126 --> 00:59:48,849
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of each class, students journal about how they felt before class, how they felt after class, what might be going on with them.

589
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:55,831
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an opportunity for them to kind of reflect to see how class went and how they're feeling at the end, which is a great opportunity.

590
00:59:56,675 --> 01:00:03,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can move on to the next slide on this, um, for assessment for all of these classes.

591
01:00:03,678 --> 01:00:08,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we are doing, um, skill assessment and rubrics for physical education as well.

592
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:11,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to professional development.

593
01:00:12,702 --> 01:00:23,547
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to what the district has provided, uh, for professional development, the physical education and health education teachers this year have, um, done CPR certification.

594
01:00:23,747 --> 01:00:25,788
[SPEAKER_02]: They, we just completed that in March.

595
01:00:26,355 --> 01:00:29,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And first aid certification will be completing in June.

596
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:34,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've also taken part in relaxation techniques and self-care.

597
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,601
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a presentation by Seth Monk.

598
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:39,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any of you remember him.

599
01:00:39,821 --> 01:00:51,747
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done presentations for us before to really go over some relaxation techniques that our staff can use to bring to their students, but also use for themselves during everything that's going on right now.

600
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:56,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can actually move to the next slide.

601
01:00:59,003 --> 01:00:59,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

602
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:07,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so moving forward, I know in the past we've talked about, um, hiring a middle school health teacher so that we have one in each building.

603
01:01:08,405 --> 01:01:13,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we're, we're looking to add that and to hire adaptive physical education teacher.

604
01:01:13,306 --> 01:01:15,567
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also looking to add that still.

605
01:01:15,587 --> 01:01:18,267
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't been able to do that yet under curriculum.

606
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:22,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you see, I have reviewing the always changing puberty curriculum with the director of nursing.

607
01:01:23,509 --> 01:01:28,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also wanted to review the flash curriculum for our special education students to make sure that we are inclusive.

608
01:01:30,075 --> 01:01:38,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Professional development, we would look to provide some sex education professional development as we, like I spoke about before, the standards have changed.

609
01:01:40,123 --> 01:01:50,411
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to maybe get some more training on that and unpack those as well and provide adaptive PE professional development for the entire physical education staff.

610
01:01:52,387 --> 01:02:00,393
[SPEAKER_02]: One more piece I just wanted to add is that, due to the pandemic, the health and physical education curriculum had to be adjusted to meet the needs of our students.

611
01:02:01,374 --> 01:02:06,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Health education covered time management skills, stress relief, and things like yoga.

612
01:02:07,818 --> 01:02:14,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we're in person, we're coming back to our curriculum set that I showed you here today.

613
01:02:15,044 --> 01:02:19,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And physical education classes were front loaded with lessons that included no equipment.

614
01:02:19,793 --> 01:02:24,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the beginning, we were doing things like fitness, yoga, relaxation, because kids were at home.

615
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,062
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't necessarily have equipment at home.

616
01:02:27,642 --> 01:02:33,910
[SPEAKER_02]: My teachers did a great job using what they could to get students to be active.

617
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,313
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to the next slide.

618
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:38,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that is it.

619
01:02:38,575 --> 01:02:39,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's your question slide.

620
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:42,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

621
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Rachel.

622
01:02:43,601 --> 01:02:45,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Rachel, I'm going to start off the questioning this time.

623
01:02:46,405 --> 01:02:51,793
[SPEAKER_05]: You did on the last slide hit the most important questions for me right now.

624
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:58,123
[SPEAKER_05]: The adaptive PE, to what level are we offering and meeting the needs of special education students?

625
01:02:58,543 --> 01:03:00,224
[SPEAKER_05]: for instance, autistic students.

626
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:04,427
[SPEAKER_05]: And you mentioned the flash curriculum, is it good for special ed?

627
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,149
[SPEAKER_05]: But as we were going through all the class levels, that was exactly what I was curious about.

628
01:03:09,469 --> 01:03:20,836
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if we have a substantially separate high school class that's held at the high school, are those students receiving health education and how is it modified appropriately?

629
01:03:21,837 --> 01:03:27,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have some students going into health classes and we do have some students that

630
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:29,211
[SPEAKER_02]: might be separated for certain things.

631
01:03:29,271 --> 01:03:33,413
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what their IEP calls for.

632
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:36,975
[SPEAKER_02]: We are adapting our health education units.

633
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:41,998
[SPEAKER_02]: We do use a little bit of units that are lower grades to adapt right now.

634
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:46,241
[SPEAKER_02]: The flash curriculum is specifically for special education students.

635
01:03:46,261 --> 01:03:52,725
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to take a look at that so that we can compare to what we have now to see if that would be a better option for us.

636
01:03:53,773 --> 01:03:57,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that then an outside curriculum?

637
01:03:59,455 --> 01:03:59,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

638
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:00,195
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an online.

639
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a free curriculum.

640
01:04:02,236 --> 01:04:02,696
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free?

641
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:03,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

642
01:04:03,636 --> 01:04:04,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Music to my ears.

643
01:04:04,857 --> 01:04:05,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

644
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:06,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that would be.

645
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a way?

646
01:04:09,298 --> 01:04:11,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you send us a link for that so we could see that?

647
01:04:11,939 --> 01:04:12,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

648
01:04:12,939 --> 01:04:13,259
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

649
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:21,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So to Jenny or Paul in particular, what questions might you have for Rachel?

650
01:04:23,563 --> 01:04:30,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had some additional questions about the health curriculum, but I would defer if there's questions about P before we cycle back there.

651
01:04:33,629 --> 01:04:34,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so.

652
01:04:38,555 --> 01:04:49,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel like I totally, and maybe it's just sort of where I've entered this conversation, but I don't feel like I totally understand when you said we tried this and we liked it.

653
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:52,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand what the methodology was there.

654
01:04:52,749 --> 01:04:54,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we try two things and we liked this better?

655
01:04:56,292 --> 01:05:06,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that there would be a change of that opinion when there are dedicated health professionals, particularly at the middle school level rather than guidance counselors conducting this training?

656
01:05:06,577 --> 01:05:13,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just overall, like there's just nothing stand out about the description of the curriculum.

657
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:23,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe that's just the description, I'm not sure, but I'm just curious, like what is so great about this curriculum that we have in place?

658
01:05:23,564 --> 01:05:25,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a skills-based model.

659
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what our national standards call for.

660
01:05:28,771 --> 01:05:32,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are using a skill-based model and that's what we were looking for.

661
01:05:32,452 --> 01:05:38,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have designated health teachers that are licensed health teachers teaching it at the high school and one at the middle school.

662
01:05:38,674 --> 01:05:41,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did try it and really liked the curriculum.

663
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:46,637
[SPEAKER_02]: They did have second step that they were using before this.

664
01:05:46,857 --> 01:05:48,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was very outdated.

665
01:05:48,457 --> 01:05:50,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was something that was not very easy to follow.

666
01:05:50,898 --> 01:05:53,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did not address all the skills that

667
01:05:54,399 --> 01:05:56,200
[SPEAKER_02]: we needed to address at that time.

668
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is why we went with the Michigan model.

669
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:04,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I did look at what other districts were doing, and this was something that was recommended by other districts as well.

670
01:06:05,263 --> 01:06:18,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jenny, in the past, in prior years, this was a deep conversation as we were looking at our curriculum and seeing it was not adequate.

671
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:22,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there was much discussion about

672
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:37,439
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at our curriculum and looking at the Michigan model, which sort of rose like the cream to the top and talking about that, getting feedback from our principals and from our teachers.

673
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:45,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, I would say that it was, you know, it's always important to review curriculum and to make sure they're still meeting our needs.

674
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:49,186
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do want to say that this was something that was,

675
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:51,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that is.

676
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:54,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Thoroughly talked about on the school committee level.

677
01:06:58,491 --> 01:06:58,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I just.

678
01:06:59,672 --> 01:07:02,714
[SPEAKER_06]: This the scope and sequence seems so.

679
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:11,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Slow to me in terms of like when topics are being covered and I. That is just sort of my reaction.

680
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I.

681
01:07:20,647 --> 01:07:23,971
[SPEAKER_06]: There are fourth grade girls who get their period.

682
01:07:23,991 --> 01:07:32,021
[SPEAKER_06]: All of these things, like as long as we might want these

683
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:37,818
[SPEAKER_06]: life decisions to be put off as adults.

684
01:07:38,698 --> 01:07:44,901
[SPEAKER_06]: We can want that all we want, but it's education's job to prepare students.

685
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:53,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't have a huge comfort level that we're preparing our students as best we could at the moment.

686
01:07:54,765 --> 01:07:57,686
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean the curriculum is not capable of that.

687
01:07:58,326 --> 01:07:58,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

688
01:07:59,107 --> 01:08:01,648
[SPEAKER_06]: There is still a huge gap for me that I haven't

689
01:08:02,628 --> 01:08:05,210
[SPEAKER_06]: been able to reconcile based on this conversation.

690
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:30,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to make sure that if there's something that you need to really have us all feel good, and you're the expert, so I care more about what you think than what I think, but I want us to feel like we are being modern in our approach and that we are

691
01:08:31,785 --> 01:08:38,788
[SPEAKER_06]: making sure that we are preparing students for the life that they will live, whether we prepare them or not.

692
01:08:39,588 --> 01:08:56,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And however we need to do that, if that is this curriculum, that's fabulous news, it's already in house, but if there's something else that is needed, I just want us to identify that as quickly as possible so that we can get it in place.

693
01:08:57,577 --> 01:08:58,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Superintendent?

694
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:10,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say, Memogram, in response to some of your comments, that yes, Michigan model is definitely one of the models that is respected.

695
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:15,118
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, the fact that it's skills-based in the opening

696
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:17,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel, Ms.

697
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:27,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Perry was sharing about following the national standards as opposed to the state standards because the national, the state curriculum, I believe, went back to 99.

698
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:31,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the process of being updated, but it hasn't happened just yet.

699
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:35,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So the state, the national standards are the standards that

700
01:09:35,509 --> 01:09:40,191
[SPEAKER_04]: people should be paying attention to and the fact that it is skill space.

701
01:09:40,232 --> 01:09:49,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want you to know that Michigan model is definitely respected for at least being one of the stronger programs out there.

702
01:09:50,377 --> 01:10:03,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And in regards to your second comment about it's true, girls are developing and hitting puberty at younger ages, especially students of color.

703
01:10:04,524 --> 01:10:11,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Black and brown are hitting, students are hitting puberty at exceptionally younger ages.

704
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:31,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that is something, but research is also talking about from the health umbrella or health perspective for us also to provide education on the importance of healthy eating because certain foods right now, you know,

705
01:10:32,367 --> 01:10:53,662
[SPEAKER_04]: people who aren't medical experts are saying, is it the hormones that's being given to corn or chicken or whatever it is that you're eating, that the hormones are also almost pushing young girls into puberty at much younger and earlier ages.

706
01:10:54,203 --> 01:10:59,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think the aspect about healthy eating, healthy lifestyle,

707
01:11:01,608 --> 01:11:30,275
[SPEAKER_04]: you know being active because all of that and you know with the puberty onset of puberty it's also connected to weight so um if there's early obesity and other or signs of that that like one thing can trigger the other which can trigger the other so it it it definitely is something that you know I think we're aware of and we do have to definitely listen to um

708
01:11:31,135 --> 01:11:44,725
[SPEAKER_04]: medical guidance, but I just wanted to let you know that we're aware that there are a lot of factors and how it just is impacting society in general.

709
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:49,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to add that comment to what you were saying earlier.

710
01:11:49,829 --> 01:11:50,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

711
01:11:55,032 --> 01:11:56,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

712
01:11:56,233 --> 01:11:58,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other questions for Ms.

713
01:11:58,335 --> 01:11:58,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Perry?

714
01:12:00,645 --> 01:12:04,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Rachel, Paul, no, Jenny.

715
01:12:05,486 --> 01:12:06,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

716
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:07,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

717
01:12:07,566 --> 01:12:07,926

[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much, Rachel, and thank you everybody else for attending who's here.
