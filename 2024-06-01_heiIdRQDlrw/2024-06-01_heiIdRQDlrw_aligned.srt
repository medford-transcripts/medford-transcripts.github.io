00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:07,160
Medford City Council, Committee of the Whole, January 24th, 2024.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,581
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:11,363
Present.

4
00:00:12,343 --> 00:00:13,184
Present.

5
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:13,864
Present.

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:16,646
Present.

7
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:17,547
Present.

8
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:18,307
Present.

9
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:20,869
Present.

10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,072
Present.

11
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:25,992
Present.

12
00:00:26,072 --> 00:00:26,633
Seven present.

13
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:28,394
Zero absent, the meeting is called to order.

14
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:40,601
24-006, offered by myself, President Baird, is a resolution to propose a 2024-2025 council governing agenda framework and request the councilors submit proposals by January 18th, 2024.

15
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:56,307
Be it resolved by the city council that councillors submit items to be included in a 2024-2025 Manfred City Council governing agenda document, draft template attached in packet that will guide the work of this council and its committees during this term.

16
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:02,531
Be it further resolved that councillors submit items to the clerk by Thursday, January 18th, 2024 for further discussion in committee of the whole.

17
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:07,174
So thank you to everyone for your submissions to this agenda.

18
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:08,855
I was able to

19
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:19,703
get those submissions from the clerk and compile them into this larger framework, which has gone from, I think, about 18 pages to 30 something pages.

20
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:21,444
So lots of good stuff was submitted.

21
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:23,065
And I think that's great.

22
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,127
You know, we're not going to.

23
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:32,179
necessarily get through and decide on every little nitty gritty detail of every item tonight.

24
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:37,742
But my intent is to quickly summarize this document.

25
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:41,263
Again, as I did at the meeting, it was introduced, our first meeting.

26
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:55,170
Then we can go through the items that are in each committee and we can flag A, if there's a major disagreement, if there are folks, individual counselor or multiple counselors who say, I don't think this is an item we should be having on this agenda.

27
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:59,919
We can discuss that if necessary, we can vote to remove it or not.

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:11,587
We can also take a look at there are a number of items in here that have been, you know, not quite necessarily introduced yet in terms of they haven't been formally introduced as official council papers.

29
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:17,171
So we should just note that and, you know, folks should be ready to introduce items.

30
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:21,114
And then there were some items that either didn't necessarily have a lead counselor,

31
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:25,577
Or didn't have quite a didn't have a timeline or didn't have a full description or a goal.

32
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:35,583
So we can at least note those and either in committee or individual, you know, they can be discussed in committees when referred to committees, or they could be.

33
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,314
You know, individual counselors could introduce the further fleshed out more formal item.

34
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:47,320
They may have taken a very short summary and submitted it, but they may have I don't know.

35
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,403
You guys might have more information on different things and ideas that you want to do.

36
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:52,245
And also, if there's, you know.

37
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:54,968
I think this is in the wrong committee.

38
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,969
It should go somewhere else.

39
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,270
I think that's a flag as well.

40
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:07,651
And then the last thing I want to do before we get out of here tonight is just make sure that we kind of refer this document to each of the committees so that they can have a chance to review them.

41
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:11,093
I think that's a good start for the 1st meetings of those committees.

42
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:13,255
You can only committee chairs if they also want to.

43
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:16,445
formally discuss other items in addition to reviewing this.

44
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:18,186
Of course, that's the discretion of the chairs.

45
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:29,933
And also, Vice President Collins and I have talked about looking at a schedule for how often we would review this collectively and how often leadership would try to make updates to the document.

46
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:33,776
So that's pretty much what I'm thinking for tonight.

47
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:40,540
Does anyone have anything else they want to touch on this document that I didn't just kind of mention?

48
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:46,008
any other types of review we want to do of this tonight.

49
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,208
Councillor Collins, Vice President Collins.

50
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:49,348
Thank you, President Bares.

51
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:50,709
I think that plan sounds great.

52
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:56,510
Of course, with such a long document, of course, this is sketching out everything that we aspire to do over the next two years.

53
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:07,752
I think that probably the best use of our time is to, as we're going through this, if there's things that Councillors, kind of reiterating what you just said, if there's things that Councillors have questions on, like, I don't understand what this project is that we're

54
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:11,375
proposing to be referred to committee or if something seems incomplete.

55
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:17,540
Essentially, if there are any critical substance-related flags, I think that this is a good time to quickly go over those.

56
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:26,729
But in general, a lot of these projects we have touched on before, either previous term, in this term, we were talking about creating this document.

57
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:28,830
So I think this is a great time to kind of

58
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:35,016
We've all had several days to look at this after a couple weeks to submit our own proposals.

59
00:04:35,697 --> 00:04:45,159
And then, of course, the deep dives will occur in committee for any of the projects that get referred there, assuming that most, if not all, of these will end up getting referred.

60
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:46,599
Thank you.

61
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,520
Thank you.

62
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,300
Any other comments before we get going?

63
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:52,461
Cool.

64
00:04:54,938 --> 00:05:09,490
So just to summarize again, the intent of this document is a framework, a living document of the work that this council is doing actively or over the next essentially two years of this elected term.

65
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:16,807
It's kind of a document that can serve as a guidepost for us to see.

66
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:19,068
I mean, I think it's an ambitious agenda.

67
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:20,629
I think there's a ton of great stuff in here.

68
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,891
And we can see how much of it we've gotten done.

69
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:26,572
Are we keeping to timelines?

70
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:29,013
Are things that are taking longer than expected?

71
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:35,216
Are there new items that have come up that maybe need to take priority over some of the items that we have in here today?

72
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:45,097
You know, for example, I had a lot of ideas in January 2020 that were very different by April 2020, given the circumstances of the pandemic.

73
00:05:45,157 --> 00:05:47,438
So that's really the intent here.

74
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,140
This is split up by committee.

75
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,741
So there was committee of the whole.

76
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:59,132
There were a few ordinances that were in committee of the whole that we were looking at.

77
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:03,095
So those are still, we still need to work through those and hopefully work through those.

78
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:09,840
They are mostly done, I would say, or at least there have been many meetings on the way to completion.

79
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:17,467
And that's the tree ordinances, tree preservation protection or replacement ordinances, leaf blower ordinance and food truck ordinance.

80
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:21,270
So those are kind of existing projects that are carrying over.

81
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,732
Some of these other items are existing projects too, but those were,

82
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,525
really pretty fully baked and we're already in committee of the whole food truck.

83
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:35,669
And then just for the rest of this, I just want to quickly, you know, for

84
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:50,327
I'm sure councillors have read the committee assignments and whatnot, but if there is anybody, you know, for folks on zoom, anybody watching on streaming or on TV, the other seven committees are an administration and finance committee, which I am chairing.

85
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:58,294
There's an education and culture committee chaired by Councillor Scarpelli, a governance committee chaired by Councillor Sang.

86
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:02,537
Planning and Permitting Committee, chaired by Vice President Collins.

87
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:07,939
Public Health and Community Safety Committee, chaired by Councilor Lozaro.

88
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:11,581
Public Works and Facilities Committee, chaired by Councilor Callahan.

89
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:16,123
Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, chaired by Councilor Lemming.

90
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:21,965
Um, so we'll go through each of those committees, the way the committee structure works.

91
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:26,627
We are all members of all the committees in terms of we can all attend and speak up.

92
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:31,009
But in terms of voting members, 5 counselors are voting members of each committee.

93
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:38,372
Um, so that's what it will be used in terms of quorum and in terms of the votes of items out of committee.

94
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:47,433
If you are interested in even more detail, you can see on the city website, what are the former subcommittees that are now kind of making up these new committees?

95
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:57,718
What are some of the policy areas, city departments and city ordinances that each committee is responsible for reviewing and for, you know, kind of just overseeing?

96
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:00,754
So that's a general summary.

97
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:07,780
I want to get into the meat of this so we can go through each committee and flag any issues.

98
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,101
We started with Committee of the Whole.

99
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:12,964
We have the three projects in Committee of the Whole.

100
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:19,049
We have the Tree Preservation Protection Replacement Ordinance, the Leaf Blower Ordinance, and the Food Truck Ordinance.

101
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:27,496
And the goal here is to really finish those up in the next three to six months at most, so get those done early in the term.

102
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:31,494
Does anyone have any questions, objections?

103
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:32,734
Go to Councillor Callaghan.

104
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:37,958
I'm just curious about procedure, and I know that the committees were different in the last cycle.

105
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:45,782
These tree preservation leaf blower, which seem like they might be under environment, are they in Committee of the Whole because of the change of structure of the committees?

106
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:51,686
Or is there a reason why things might go to Committee of the Whole rather than be in a specific other committee?

107
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:59,139
Yeah, so these were already these had been in subcommittee and had been referred out to committee of the whole, so they kind of had moved through part of the process already.

108
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,140
I think something we're going to want to figure out this term.

109
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:08,867
Since technically every committee is a committee of the whole do we want traditionally the step had been well, I don't want to say traditionally.

110
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:16,333
A way that ordinances had been moved through a process was for it to be introduced on the council agenda.

111
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:34,064
For a draft to be created either by what we have in-house counsel, the city solicitor, the assistant solicitor, generally in the last term, it was more often the draft was created by a council member, maybe working with a member of departmental staff, occasionally in concert with the KP law.

112
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:36,870
legal counsel, the outside legal counsel for the city.

113
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:53,802
Whatever either is an idea or a formal draft would be proposed at regular meeting, that would then be referred to a subcommittee and discussed, and then that would have been referred to committee of the whole so that everyone could get a swing at it, and then it would go to regular meeting.

114
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:59,478
Maybe we don't need to take that extra step now, but given that it's a new committee structure, I think.

115
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:02,599
We can decide, you know, and committees themselves can decide.

116
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,100
All right, the 5 of us have taken a look, but we really want to take an extra step.

117
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,420
Maybe.

118
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:17,323
The charter example, if we ended up with a draft charter coming out of governance committee, maybe that should then go to committee of the whole for another meeting or 2, something like that.

119
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:18,363
But.

120
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:27,040
You know, I think that's something new in the process, but essentially those three items are a committee of the whole because they were had already moved through to that stage of the previous term.

121
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:38,887
Any questions, concerns, thoughts around the three ordinances that are in committee of the whole.

122
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,150
And obviously, we can get to the details when we meet on that.

123
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:50,777
Kit and I were trying to figure out exactly who we were waiting on, what feedback to continue on each one.

124
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:59,123
I appreciate that the current status is in there, so we can, we don't even need to ask, like, we can see immediately, like, what is it waiting on, so thank you for that.

125
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:11,873
Yes, yeah, and so that's the, you know, for these ones we have, we have that, and I think that would be good, you know, for chairs, committee chairs to maybe add that into the items in their committees once we're there.

126
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,806
All right, the next one is administration finance committee.

127
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:17,888
So we have a lot of stuff here.

128
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:28,825
The topic based committees or policy area based committees are split up into three sections, major projects, ordinances, and then oversight and engagement.

129
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:41,121
So for administration and finance, we have major projects, the annual budget process, revenue generation, proposition two and a half, and the classification and compensation study implementation.

130
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:52,586
Then we have ordinances, we have budget ordinance, commercial vacancy tax, which has yet to be introduced, good landlord tax credit local option,

131
00:11:53,306 --> 00:12:16,433
community benefits agreement ordinance which has to be introduced percent for our ordinance paid family and medical leave extended illness leave bank and then in oversight and engagement we have financial review and long-term budget planning and forecasting and we have another item and this appears in every committee review relevant city ordinances and regulations so the idea there is if we have nothing else going

132
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:29,112
There's probably an ordinance or regulation that should to be looked at for updating because there's quite a bit of anachronistic and archaic ordinance and regulatory language in the city's legal body.

133
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:35,556
And I will go to just just a question for reduced for introducing these ordinances.

134
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:38,357
So, the commercial vacancy tax could potentially.

135
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,820
be worked on in both planning and permitting committee, as noted in here, as well as admin and finance.

136
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,421
So what would the process for something being developed simultaneously in two different committees look like?

137
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:55,922
Yeah, I think it should be sequential.

138
00:12:57,003 --> 00:13:01,124
I think the question was, if there's something that maybe could fit into two committees, how would that work?

139
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:04,125
I mean, conceivably, the committees could have a joint meeting.

140
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:04,945
I don't know what that would

141
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:07,768
look like or if it necessarily would make sense.

142
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:14,812
But I think if you're thinking it could be in both, maybe send it to the one you think where it's more relevant to start.

143
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:21,277
And then if at the end of that process, it feels like it needs input from another committee, the committee could refer it to the other committee.

144
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:30,524
But I think also, you know, just given the composition of the bodies, you know, we can get that in.

145
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,325
Yeah, I'll go to Councilor Lazaro.

146
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:42,022
Yeah, it occurs to me that a lot of the projects I've been thinking of in the public health and community safety are going to overlap a lot with resident services.

147
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:46,004
But I think it's probably just a matter of picking one that makes the most sense.

148
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:53,630
If somebody is interested, they're not on that committee, but they're interested in that particular issue, they come to that meeting, they can speak on it.

149
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:58,033
It may eventually, maybe it goes to committee of the whole after, would that be an option?

150
00:13:58,053 --> 00:13:58,253
Yeah.

151
00:13:58,373 --> 00:13:58,594
Yeah.

152
00:13:58,834 --> 00:13:59,054
Okay.

153
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:01,836
And I think those, it's really not like a,

154
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:09,366
super strict and there's no checklist of steps that it has to go through.

155
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:19,429
And I think it's really whichever committee is considering it, whatever they feel comfortable with the disposition when they feel like they've done their work is probably fine.

156
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:29,132
Um, and you know, just cause it's an administration and finance doesn't mean you can't invite the planning staff if that's for your example.

157
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:47,266
So are there any anything in there that folks are really against that they don't want to have on the table for this governing agenda or think should be in a different committee or otherwise have questions and thoughts about?

158
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:49,967
Councilor Callahan.

159
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:52,891
I was so excited to see the percent for art ordinance.

160
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:55,014
Yeah.

161
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,157
Councilor Collins, Vice Mayor Collins.

162
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:06,910
Well, thank you for bringing that up because I was internally debating whether to say I noticed the percent for our ordinance was, as we can see from the paper number introduced in

163
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:08,692
year 2020.

164
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:13,235
I think it's a good one to bring forward and see if we can get to it this term.

165
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,957
Despite my day job, I don't need to be the lead counselor on it.

166
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:23,742
So I just throw that out to Councilor Callahan and all my fellow counselors if anybody sees this and wants to take point on it.

167
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:29,666
I would gladly relinquish my sponsorship or share leadership with somebody else.

168
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:33,828
Great.

169
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:34,709
Yeah, you know, again,

170
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:44,545
I think those can discussions can happen in committee unless if people are desperately formally wanting to move that they be the lead counselor percent for our ordinance, we can happily consider it.

171
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:47,127
But we have some time on those questions as well.

172
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:54,492
And then I think just going through, I just want to make sure just to flag anything else here.

173
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:57,394
It did look like.

174
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:03,278
So we had two ordinance, two items in here that did need to be introduced formally.

175
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:08,059
So that would be the commercial vacancy tax and the community benefits agreement ordinance.

176
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,060
So just flagging that we do have lead counselors.

177
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,840
We have councilor Leming on the commercial vacancy, community benefits agreement.

178
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:22,282
We had councilors Collins and saying, so at some point somebody needs to introduce those items and refer them to the administration and finance committee.

179
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:25,203
Councilor Lazaro.

180
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:47,416
just this is just a procedural question but when uh if november 2024 so if the community benefits agreement ordinance the goal of is to start that november 2024 is the idea that you would present it to in a regular meeting around that time or or anytime

181
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:49,792
think any time before.

182
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,853
And then the idea being that that project can start.

183
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:52,914
Yeah, for 2024.

184
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:53,134
Okay.

185
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:53,674
Yeah.

186
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,815
And I think again, it's a guidepost, right?

187
00:16:55,855 --> 00:17:13,322
It's like, okay, you know, and I think these chart one of the things I really appreciate the chart move, which Councillor Collins had kind of started because it's like, oh, I can visualize how much work is happening and when in the committees and the printed version doesn't quite because it's not color version doesn't quite get the, uh,

188
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:22,924
There's some color coding that the red things are major projects, the yellow things are ordinances, and the green things are oversight engagement.

189
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:30,609
May not always be true that that's like how much work is going into each of those, but I kind of just, you know, I figured it was a good first pass.

190
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:32,070
Councilor Callahan.

191
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,792
Will there be an updated digital copy of this regularly as things change?

192
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:45,411
Yes, and that's something, yeah, and so I think, Councilor Collins, you had talked about a monthly, we could take a look at it monthly and try to go monthly on it.

193
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:55,638
If that timeline becomes burdensome for us, just in terms of, maybe we'll scale back to quarterly or something, but that was our, yeah, Councilor Collins, Vice President Collins.

194
00:17:55,778 --> 00:18:04,144
Yeah, my aspiration is to check in with all committee chairs monthly to say, where are we at on what and update this document.

195
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:15,311
If that cadence doesn't quite work out, I think certainly keeping it updated on at least quarterly basis so we can track where we are and perhaps update further start dates accordingly.

196
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:16,712
So that's the plan.

197
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:17,472
Yeah, thank you for that.

198
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:20,933
Great.

199
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:25,894
So I'm just trying to set my screen up here and make sure I can see.

200
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:28,475
Councillor Scarpelli.

201
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:38,113
Yeah, so it looks like everything else in this committee had a lead and a timeline and a general description and goal.

202
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:43,238
Maybe the commercial vacancy tax could get more specific when introduced.

203
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:46,561
But other than that, that all looked good.

204
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:51,706
And certainly there's plenty of ordinances and regulations to look at too.

205
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,449
So any other thoughts around administration and finance committee?

206
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:02,062
just that I'm excited about these ideas.

207
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:02,964
Cool.

208
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:04,989
Thank you, Councillor Sayeed.

209
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:08,156
Sorry.

210
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:14,572
I just have one.

211
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:21,497
I also admire how many real already established ordinances are in that committee.

212
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:30,363
And I have a goal for the rest of the committees to look that way after this meeting, maybe, and maybe in a little while.

213
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:38,249
But that one seems really nicely like a benchmark for us, like a nice template for us to build on.

214
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:41,640
Yeah, I think it's, there's a lot in there for sure.

215
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:49,282
And yeah, I'm hoping, it'll be interesting to see something that I'm interested in.

216
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,583
Like right now we have it kind of set up.

217
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:57,025
Oh, you know, every planning and permitting, I think it's the only one that's even more fleshed out than that administration and finance.

218
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:01,846
And so that's why at least in the first passes, like that's one that should be meeting twice a month.

219
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:06,788
I think it'll be interesting to see based on, and I think this document gives us an indication

220
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:12,344
maybe there's some committees that don't need to meet every month, and maybe there's some committees that need to meet more than once a month.

221
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:19,548
And we'll start to kind of feel out what that frequency looks like, I think, as we move through the first meetings.

222
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:33,215
And I think it's important for chairs to kind of be aware, you know, I think the resident services and public engagement had a lot of stuff to, not that there's not a lot of meat in quite a few of these, but it'll be interesting to see

223
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:38,896
what needs to be more frequent and less frequent in terms of the committees.

224
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:43,880
So the next one is Education and Culture Committee.

225
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,524
This is one where there's not a ton of stuff right now, but I do know that there's a lot of conversation and engagement around it.

226
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:53,667
So I am hoping this will get filled in a little bit more as we move through.

227
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:57,210
Right now, it just has reviewing the relevant city ordinances and regulations.

228
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:03,612
But again, I know there's a lot of energy around these issues.

229
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:08,134
This would include arts, city events, education, history, recreation, youth affairs.

230
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:23,079
There's departments, Medford Public Schools, Medford Public Library, Recreation, Parks Commission, Medford Arts Council, relevant city ordinances and regulations, Chapter 2, Article 3, Boards and Commissions, Chapter 2, Article 4, Officers and Employees.

231
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:32,805
Chapter 26, Education, Chapter 62, Parks and Recreation, you know, those are, there's a whole show about parks and recreation, so I figure we can fill out a committee about it.

232
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:48,855
So, you know, I'm interested to see what we can fill in here, because I know there's a lot of great ideas, tons of ideas floating around for different cultural events that the city may want to host, and different, you know,

233
00:21:49,870 --> 00:22:11,602
Certainly the library is such an amazing, vibrant community center with the new building, even more so than it was prior so hoping, hoping that more will fill in here and I'll go to counselor say, I'm just going to take advantage of this opportunity and plug the Lunar New Year celebration on February 10, we'll have line, the lion dance will have

234
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,623
free boba and free pastries.

235
00:22:15,524 --> 00:22:19,825
We have readings for children and crafts for children as well.

236
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:21,206
It's going to be a hoot.

237
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:26,828
So I'd love to see you all down there at the library on February 10th.

238
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:29,009
I believe festivities start around noon.

239
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:36,176
So I wanted since President bears mentioned cultural events, I wanted to plug that.

240
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:48,869
I think another note that I have for this committee is that there are certain projects that are starting out and other committees, because I essentially the youth commission is the 1 I'm thinking of where I think.

241
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,614
For now, it makes more sense over there because it has to do directly with resident engagement.

242
00:22:55,415 --> 00:23:01,661
Once that's flushed out and passed, maybe the activities that the city council engages in with the youth commission fit in here more.

243
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:13,233
I think that becomes topic dependent, but there are certainly ideas in other committees that might start out there that eventually might find their way over here as well.

244
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:21,539
I want to bring up two ideas that came up as I was knocking on doors.

245
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,365
I hope to, you know, encourage these to happen.

246
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:35,255
One is to encourage our schools to offer more opportunities for our children to spend in the fells.

247
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:37,978
and in nature.

248
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:49,907
And the other one that I got from a 10-year-old at the doors is called Lemonade Stand Days, where we send out a text message to everyone in the city saying, if you're a kid, get your lemonade stand ready.

249
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:53,249
If you're a grown-up, put cash in your pocket.

250
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,232
The night before any day, it's going to be over 90 degrees.

251
00:23:59,494 --> 00:23:59,934
I love that.

252
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:01,415
Yeah, and I think those are great.

253
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:08,444
great ways that this whole thing is about bringing people together and also kids.

254
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:12,666
So I think that's a great couple of great ideas.

255
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:13,886
I'll throw them down if you want to.

256
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:16,728
I'll put them in my notes and they'll be in the committee report of course.

257
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:22,410
If they want to be formalized in any way feel free to submit any sort of agenda item and refer it over.

258
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,912
And I actually think that you know we do have our

259
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:33,680
director of community affairs in the mayor's office who tends to organize city events.

260
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,186
And I think this would be a great place to maybe interact with her and maybe also with Caché.

261
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:43,849
Ken Kraus puts out through Caché, and I know others participate.

262
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:44,690
I shouldn't just say Ken.

263
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,955
Ken and others put out a great monthly calendar of arts and culture events in the city.

264
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:53,758
So maybe there's some sort of synergy there

265
00:24:55,029 --> 00:25:04,691
bringing all of those different voices together and bringing new ideas and making sure that they're broadcast out, at least through our council, through the council's voice.

266
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:08,292
Council Vice President Collins.

267
00:25:08,992 --> 00:25:09,332
Thank you.

268
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:10,132
Appreciate that.

269
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:20,695
And it strikes me, going off of what Councilor Ziaro noted about some committees being, going into this process more flush with ordinances and projects than others, I think that

270
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:31,312
I assume that we'll see some of the work of some of these committees will be more straightforwardly legislative related to, you know, our official functions, promulgating policies.

271
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:39,863
Others, like perhaps the Education and Culture Committee is a good example of this, their role will be more broadcasting, engaging, synergistic.

272
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:57,264
You know, just in line with the, the topic of those committees and I think that would be a great way to organize kind of the various functions that this council serves between broadcasting events, helping to be a liaison between community partners city hall partners.

273
00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:05,847
And I think that that will be a good way for us to budget our capacity because probably realistically if we were working on a full slate of ordinances and every committee.

274
00:26:07,588 --> 00:26:09,469
There's only so many Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the year.

275
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:16,631
So I think this will be a great way for us to get a lot done and do the best that we can to complete all the projects that we set out to complete.

276
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:20,793
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

277
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:23,774
Any further thoughts on Education and Culture Committee?

278
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:32,657
Seeing none, I want to make sure I lose George and Matt a little bit here with this new setup.

279
00:26:32,677 --> 00:26:33,457
I'm excited for the

280
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:41,381
when we have new microphones, to be able to press a button and I'll be able to see you in a stack and call on you in the order in which you pressed your button.

281
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:47,044
So I won't have to guess on... Which is the old system.

282
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:49,606
Which is the old system, yes.

283
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:50,066
Yes.

284
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:53,548
We will be at least restoring the functionality of 2019 to this chamber.

285
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:59,491
The next item is governance committee.

286
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:05,079
This is generally looking at ordinances, rules, charter and elections.

287
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,263
Departments include the clerk's department, law department, election commission, boards and commissions.

288
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:15,067
There's relevant city ordinances and regulations.

289
00:27:15,107 --> 00:27:29,158
I think the one to note here is that this would be a committee looking at the rules of the council, special acts of the state legislature that are relevant to Medford, as well as legislative acts accepted by the city.

290
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:31,420
So provisions of state law that the city has accepted

291
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:32,712
Um...

292
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:40,375
So the major projects here are updates to the city charter, estimated length and timing of project is 12 to 18 months.

293
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:56,339
And really this is to create a proposal for an updated city charter, two with the approval of the mayor, submit to the state house and senate for approval, reviewing the charter study committee's research and draft language, as well as proposals from prior councils.

294
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,641
We had some discussion last night of items that may be included, city staff boards and commissions,

295
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:22,974
And to begin some preliminary meetings, looks like, you know, about May, June of this year, invite the charter study committee and call center to submit what they have, if that's an advance of their final recommendations, but want to give this council a good time to dig in and kind of set out its own process and procedure.

296
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:32,980
I don't think we need to go the Somerville route and take four years to put this together, especially with the Charter City Committee having done some good foundational work for us.

297
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,182
But that's really, I think, the big project of this committee.

298
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:42,024
Another piece we did discuss last night was the election department oversight report and recommendations.

299
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:44,225
We did receive the after action report.

300
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:52,169
I think there was general consensus that it was not a sufficient report and that some of the recommendations need to be stronger.

301
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:54,469
and clearer to the public.

302
00:28:54,549 --> 00:29:06,695
So we'll take that motion that went out last night, Councilor Callahan's motion around democracy, pro-democracy reforms that could be done by charter ordinance or home rule petition.

303
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:16,561
And then also reviewing city ordinances and regulations, you know, something that could come up in this committee, maybe, you know, was kind of thrown out on around,

304
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:18,282
in recent weeks.

305
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:25,651
We have a lot of boards and commissions and no rhyme or reason I can find as to who gets paid what and why.

306
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:29,917
And I think that may be a topic to discuss too.

307
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:41,385
We had members of the Parks Commission in the building last night for their meeting, and they came in and they said, we're the only commission that's existed since we became a city in 1892, and we don't get a dollar.

308
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:54,374
And the Hormel Commission, which regulates just Hormel Stadium, gets a stipend, but the Parks Commission, which regulates 27 parks and fields or something, maybe even more than that, I can't remember the number, does not get a stipend.

309
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:56,156
So there's an example of,

310
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:08,626
a little bit of confusion there, and maybe we could, so that's something that could come into here too, but those are basically the only things right now that are in this committee.

311
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:12,689
Any questions or discussions about the committee and the work that's in it?

312
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,349
Councilor Sang?

313
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:23,877
I think just to underscore what you said, much of this committee's work is stuff that will come through the process of doing one item, and so

314
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:35,585
I with this committee, even though it's short in this document, I'm expecting an avalanche of things, of fixes that need to come up.

315
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:49,995
I also think that we shouldn't underrate the work that it'll take to update the city charter and to give our feedback, given how long the city charter is and how many recommendations are coming out of the committee, of the charter review committee as well.

316
00:30:51,776 --> 00:31:04,283
I am particularly interested, this is the nerdy side of me, but going through Mass General Law, seeing what we've accepted, what we haven't accepted yet, seeing where the potential for action is there.

317
00:31:05,123 --> 00:31:05,623
So thank you.

318
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:08,725
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

319
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:11,126
Any further discussion on the Governance Committee?

320
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,270
All right, planning and permitting, we got a lot going here.

321
00:31:19,531 --> 00:31:29,475
And again, I guess I maybe should have said this earlier, but if chairs want to say anything, so far it's just been myself on administration, finance, councilor Scarpelli, education, culture, councilor second, governance.

322
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:33,976
If chairs wanna speak to the agenda here and how they feel about it, feel free to chime in.

323
00:31:35,497 --> 00:31:47,121
Planning and permitting chair, vice president Collins, we have a lot here, climate code enforcement, economic development, housing, licensing, parking, planning, permitting, science, sustainability, transportation, zoning,

324
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,211
kind of the holistic planning and permitting work of a city.

325
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:57,955
And major projects are zoning reform, which we had an interesting, good starting conversation, the vice president and I on.

326
00:31:58,596 --> 00:32:00,917
Ordinances are condo conversion ordinance.

327
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,890
housing home roll petitions, reviewing the fee schedule.

328
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:20,876
We have cycling safety ordinance, transportation demand management, energy disclosure, benchmarking ordinance, rental licensing ordinance, pesticide regulations, blasting and earth removal regulations, green score, and then oversight and engagement.

329
00:32:20,896 --> 00:32:21,297
We have

330
00:32:22,202 --> 00:32:24,304
reviewing the relevance of the ordinances and regulations.

331
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:31,132
This committee will also be reviewing licenses, permit and sign applications as needed, which is a function that has occurred in the past.

332
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:41,104
There is a specific subcommittee for that, the Subcommittee on Licensing, Permitting and Signs, chaired by Councillor Scarpelli with members Councillor Callahan and Leming.

333
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:52,487
And then efficiency retrofits for existing city buildings are sorry existing buildings in the city and transit signal priority so quite a long list.

334
00:32:52,908 --> 00:32:57,753
I will defer to Vice President Collins if you want to talk more on this committee.

335
00:32:58,934 --> 00:32:59,995
Certainly, I think that.

336
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:17,755
The way I've been conceptualizing this governing agenda overall has been to try to, you know, and of course, as we've been saying, it's a, it's a living, evolvable document, but I think that this is a tool through which we can try to project magic to ourselves, because in this committee alone, there's

337
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:20,078
certainly two years worth of work.

338
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:30,168
So thinking through how to prioritize and how to structure and schedule these projects so that we can get to everything that we want to get to for the community.

339
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:35,773
I think that this is a topic that we can revisit as a committee in our first couple of meetings.

340
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:36,374
I think that

341
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:45,047
Zoning reform is certainly going to be the characteristic project of this committee and indeed of this council this term, one of our major projects.

342
00:33:46,128 --> 00:33:54,656
And that will live in this committee and I think that so many of the major projects and ordinances that have been proposed for planning and permitting do dovetail with our zoning reform.

343
00:33:55,957 --> 00:33:57,738
Some very closely some are related.

344
00:33:58,339 --> 00:33:58,519
So,

345
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:23,349
I think it might make sense for us to begin a conversation in committee about organizing our year, you know, the work in this committee around zoning reform and structuring ordinance projects around that based on what we're talking about and when and how to make sure that our work is aligned and how to, you know, if we're touching on a topic, let's touch on it at the same time and hopefully get through our work efficiently.

346
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:28,851
And that's just because there are so many projects lined up for this committee, and they're all good ones, and we should try to get to all of them.

347
00:34:31,974 --> 00:34:34,297
Thank you, Council Vice President Collins, Councilor Seng.

348
00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:35,179
Thank you.

349
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:47,856
Um, I, you know, this is, I, this, this reminds me of what you always repeat, which is that a former Councilor told you that the three responsibilities of the City Council are really

350
00:34:48,557 --> 00:34:56,065
Um, zoning ordinances and budget, and this, I think, reflects the fact that, um, zoning takes up a third.

351
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:04,893
If not, uh, if that, um, you know, of the work that we do, and we have ordinances on top of that, that fit into this.

352
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:07,876
Um, I think vice president Collins.

353
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:10,679
This point is really important to understand.

354
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:22,308
I think, while I'm not on this committee, there are a lot of ideas in here I think that pair really well with zoning reform.

355
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:31,115
For example, I think the benchmarking, the licensing, the TDM stuff, we could talk about maybe moving it ahead in the schedule if it's feasible in the committee.

356
00:35:31,856 --> 00:35:36,380
I know there are projects that I've recommended that even with

357
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,046
with me not being on this committee, I'd be happy to show up and help pass as well.

358
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:55,102
There are some projects that other councillors have submitted that I think either I've submitted different versions of it or pretty much aligned versions of it because I reached out to them.

359
00:35:56,463 --> 00:36:01,126
the Councillors while they were still candidates to see what we could work together on.

360
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:10,071
In particular, I'm very excited about the Transportation Demand Management Ordinance idea that Councillor Lemming has also suggested and put forward.

361
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:22,198
I think it could be a really important addition to making our traffic more efficient and to incentivize the type of transit-friendly developments that we want to see in our city as well.

362
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:29,280
But the list really is countless, and these are all really great ideas, and I'm very excited for the work that can be done in this committee.

363
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:34,302
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

364
00:36:35,183 --> 00:36:38,624
Anything else that we want to talk about on the planning and permitting?

365
00:36:38,644 --> 00:36:39,244
Councilor Callahan.

366
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:49,988
I just want to highlight that the energy disclosure and benchmarking ordinances, I'm happy to take, to kind of review that and look, because certain things have to happen before other things, and

367
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:59,290
Anyway, if you want to put my name there, you can, on the Energy Disclosure, just because I want to work together with Patel in terms of looking at those

368
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:06,819
make sure.

369
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,160
And one point I forgot to make.

370
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:25,587
I think if you if folks at home take a second to peruse through this section, I've made sure to include as much as possible relevant points from the plans that we've already passed, such as a climate action plan, open space plans.

371
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:26,587
that we have.

372
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:27,748
Um comprehensive plans.

373
00:37:28,388 --> 00:37:43,476
Um I've included the points that people can go to in those documents to see how these ideas align with our city's already stated goals towards climate housing, development, urban planning, etcetera.

374
00:37:47,738 --> 00:37:47,878
Thank

375
00:37:55,791 --> 00:38:05,762
I believe the cycling safety, transportation demand management, energy disclosure, benchmarking, rental licensing, pesticide, and green score as items that need to be submitted.

376
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:11,809
We may even need to submit zoning reform formally as a new paper.

377
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:16,333
The last thing we had on there was just the RFP.

378
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:26,062
And then also the efficiency retrofits for existing buildings and the transit signal priority.

379
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:41,031
All right, next we have public health and community safety.

380
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:45,494
And we have in here, we have major projects, warming and cooling center.

381
00:38:46,112 --> 00:38:50,917
Alternative emergency response such as civilian oversight, one-stop center for public services.

382
00:38:51,718 --> 00:39:01,449
For ordinances, we have plant medicine decriminalization ordinance, overgrowth ordinance, wildlife feeding ordinance, regulating retail sales of animals raised in commercial breeding facilities.

383
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:08,253
AKA the Puppy Mills Ordinance, Gender Affirming Care and Reproductive Health Care Protection Ordinance.

384
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:21,002
Then for Oversight Engagement, we have Surveillance Ordinance Reporting, Housing Stability Notification Ordinance, Implementation and Enforcement, Emergency and Response Equipment Replacement, and Reviewing Relevant City Ordinances and Regulations.

385
00:39:21,162 --> 00:39:23,464
And I will go to Councilor Zara.

386
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:29,708
I'm so eager to get started on working on these

387
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:30,699
items.

388
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:50,515
The warming and cooling center in particular is something that's really important to me at a personal level, but I can say that the timeline in my mind would be to start talking to relevant parties after this winter is over and talk about implementing a process for next winter.

389
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:56,539
I have a question for the rest of the council about

390
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:06,114
with a new major project that hasn't happened in the city yet.

391
00:40:06,134 --> 00:40:18,798
How, as far as proposing something like this, does it start with talking to appropriate department heads and, you know,

392
00:40:20,345 --> 00:40:26,287
landowners and stuff like that before you're making a motion on the floor?

393
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:30,889
Or is it like, we're going to do this thing and then everything comes after that?

394
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,491
You know, like what's the order of operations?

395
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:39,373
Vice President Collins.

396
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:45,639
There's probably a lot to be said on this, so I'm happy to take, you know, one swing at the question.

397
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,100
I think that there's many answers to the question.

398
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,021
I think it, in general, depends on the project.

399
00:40:50,081 --> 00:41:01,247
I think that, for me, I've always found it valuable to involve potential partners and stakeholders and experts and staff that are related to the project early.

400
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:06,370
Of course, it depends on what you are trying to do.

401
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,912
Like we've talked about, some of our projects are

402
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:18,728
serving as liaison to bring together people who could work on implementing a program that's outside of our legal jurisdiction, but it's something that we have the platform to do.

403
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:24,579
There are other cases where it is an ordinance that is something that we have the power to promulgate.

404
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:32,424
If we're thinking about how to tailor this in a way that enforcement is going to go most successfully because we can do the legislation we don't do the enforcement.

405
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:41,150
I found it valuable to involve those city staff and other partners who'd be involved in enforcement and implementation early in the process so that what we are

406
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:48,756
creating can be that balance between in line with our values and our aspiration, and achievable and actionable and doable.

407
00:41:49,236 --> 00:41:52,698
So I think the short answer is, there's no right answer.

408
00:41:53,619 --> 00:42:00,243
But I found it valuable if, since most of our projects are deeply collaborative, it's I think it's completely fine to involve collaborators.

409
00:42:01,724 --> 00:42:10,150
Before the paper is formally introduced, as soon as it's formally introduced at the first meeting at the second meeting, depending on your goals.

410
00:42:12,902 --> 00:42:21,367
President, yeah, I definitely wouldn't want to alienate or steamroll any of our partners.

411
00:42:21,627 --> 00:42:37,817
So that's a concern that I have when I'm trying to think through how best to manage estimating timelines for projects that, in a perfect world, we would be able to do as soon as humanly possible because there's needs right now.

412
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:53,505
I hesitate to talk to everybody that I could possibly talk to before doing anything real, but at the same time, you know, it's a balance.

413
00:42:53,645 --> 00:43:03,167
So, but anyway, all of this to say, I'm very excited to get moving on all of these projects and get to work.

414
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:06,888
Yeah, I think just my two cents, then I'll go to Councilor Lehman and Councilor Callahan.

415
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:10,634
You know, there's been a variety of approaches.

416
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:16,023
I think it's good to kind of take a two track approach, like maybe put it on the agenda and say, hey, it's something we're looking at.

417
00:43:16,735 --> 00:43:18,136
This is a priority, right?

418
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:23,020
Stake the claim, put it out there, and then see what the options are.

419
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:28,885
Go to the city departments, go to private stakeholders, go to the community, go to potential outside funders.

420
00:43:30,026 --> 00:43:32,268
We've had a lot of examples.

421
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:45,279
The library, there were some informal conversations that Councilor Caraviello had early on with, I think, and then Director Kerr with the state board of library commissioners, and that evolved.

422
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:52,825
then into a council agenda item to request that the mayor at the time consider an application for the, and now we have a new library, right?

423
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:54,707
So that's an example.

424
00:43:54,967 --> 00:44:05,016
Councilor Marks working with a variety of people from the arts community around the arts center, you know, and it was first, it was someone looking out their window and saying, oh, this Hegner, the Hegner Center, it's a city owned building.

425
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:05,637
It's empty.

426
00:44:05,697 --> 00:44:06,958
It's kind of run down.

427
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:10,335
Could this be the Arts Center?

428
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:25,567
And then many years later, Councilor Caravaglia's involvement, you have the public-private partnership with Theory Wellness and Arts Collaborative Medford, where we have the Arts Center now on Mystic Ave, and there's ribbon-cutting next week, and there was a little opening ceremony over the weekend.

429
00:44:26,087 --> 00:44:31,132
So, you know, I could see, you know, for this, and then One Stop Service Center is really a priority of mine.

430
00:44:31,932 --> 00:44:37,135
not that the warming and cooling center isn't, maybe that's a path to go down.

431
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:52,743
But I do think, especially in this city, honestly, for the worst, I would say, it is often looking at the outside private partnership to get new stuff like this done rather than, at least in the short run of the city, being able to

432
00:44:53,923 --> 00:45:02,296
have the resources to purchase a property and then rehabilitate a property and, you know, manage a, and I know, I think the Malden Warming Center is a non-profit, private, yeah, so.

433
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:15,203
Well, there's a model that's built a little bit around the way the Malden Warming Center operates, but is implemented in Revere and Somerville this year.

434
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:24,066
Both cities have contracted with Housing Families, which is a nonprofit, but they've basically laid the foundation.

435
00:45:24,106 --> 00:45:27,107
They're doing it in their public buildings.

436
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:32,571
So Revere is hosting it in the basement of their city hall, Somerville is using the armory.

437
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:39,832
they have contracted with housing families, so they pay them.

438
00:45:39,912 --> 00:45:57,996
So I just need to, I, you know, like the fact that they've already sort of established some things with that, I think there's a lot of conversations that can be had, but it's probably, I think you're right, two pathways can put it on the agenda and also have the conversation, maybe invite folks since it's going to be on the agenda.

439
00:45:58,036 --> 00:46:02,658
And then maybe so because it's not fully fleshed out, it goes to committee after that.

440
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:04,098
And then we go from there.

441
00:46:06,218 --> 00:46:07,620
And this is a public meeting, right?

442
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,263
So it's for the parts where you want to engage the public.

443
00:46:10,923 --> 00:46:12,085
The committee serves a great role.

444
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:15,709
You know, formal agenda, we have the room, we have the space, etc.

445
00:46:16,656 --> 00:46:19,037
I'm going to Councilor Lemming, Councilor Kelly, and Councilor Sang.

446
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:19,697
Councilor Lemming.

447
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:27,040
This is just specifically regarding the plant medicine decriminalization ordinance, just to state.

448
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:35,123
The goals of that may have already been addressed by the resolution that was submitted for the next regular meeting.

449
00:46:35,143 --> 00:46:37,985
I think that

450
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:47,190
There is some work that needs to be done at the state level before that could be implemented as an ordinance locally.

451
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:58,396
So I don't necessarily want a motion to strike it now before I do a little bit more research, but it may be an update to the governing agenda in the future.

452
00:47:02,438 --> 00:47:02,618
Great.

453
00:47:02,658 --> 00:47:03,639
Thank you, Chancellor Callahan.

454
00:47:06,015 --> 00:47:06,255
Thanks.

455
00:47:06,675 --> 00:47:10,158
I'm going to bring up another idea that I heard while I was knocking on doors.

456
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:16,683
This is not at the point of writing an ordinance yet, but simply at the point of having discussions with the public.

457
00:47:17,103 --> 00:47:21,286
Someone asked if we could pass something allowing folks to have chickens in their backyard.

458
00:47:21,586 --> 00:47:26,230
And I know that the way other cities do it, it's a certain number per lake.

459
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:30,133
or nine blocks or whatever that is.

460
00:47:30,173 --> 00:47:32,734
So it's not like anyone can have as many chickens as they want.

461
00:47:32,754 --> 00:47:43,061
So, but again, not ordinance stage, simply curiosity because someone mentioned it when I was knocking on their door to see if this is something that the people in Medford are interested in.

462
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:45,983
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

463
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,806
I have things for everyone.

464
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:58,821
For Councillor Callahan, I actually have also heard this from a number of residents who are interested in the idea.

465
00:47:59,802 --> 00:48:07,207
I think, you know, as with all ordinances, it's about adapting it to our city and making sure that we have something that works for us.

466
00:48:07,307 --> 00:48:16,594
But it's an idea that I do find interesting and I do find possible, as long as we work hand in hand with city staff on it.

467
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:33,220
For Councillor Lazaro's point about the warming and cooling centre, I would recommend that you find the time to talk to Director Hunt about the why and the space at St.

468
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,620
Rayfield's.

469
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:35,841
Is it St.

470
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:36,261
Rayfield's?

471
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:37,882
I'm quoting the wrong church.

472
00:48:37,902 --> 00:48:38,082
St.

473
00:48:38,102 --> 00:48:38,342
Francis.

474
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:38,402
St.

475
00:48:38,422 --> 00:48:39,382
Francis.

476
00:48:40,262 --> 00:48:42,803
Where the city is trying to get St.

477
00:48:42,823 --> 00:48:43,444
Francis to

478
00:48:46,566 --> 00:48:47,367
Yeah, right, right.

479
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:49,148
It could just be a school.

480
00:48:49,488 --> 00:48:49,788
Yeah.

481
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:56,532
The city is trying to get the church to sell it to the Y for a longer term contract.

482
00:48:57,132 --> 00:49:00,254
And there's been talk about putting housing families in there.

483
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:11,101
Now, there's a little hesitancy on the church's end, but maybe we can coordinate efforts and get an idea about what the city's plans with that space are.

484
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:14,383
I would love to have a conversation with them, too.

485
00:49:15,216 --> 00:49:17,557
We can talk about this offline, but if you have contact info.

486
00:49:17,797 --> 00:49:18,797
Yeah, for sure.

487
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:37,163
And then for Councillor Lemming's point, I think, as with a lot of resolutions, I think oftentimes it's honestly healthy just to spark the debate to introduce the resolution in a general meeting, send it to committee.

488
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:52,948
And then in committee, discuss the idea, even if we don't reach a point, you know, reach an end point that reflects what we intended when we started, I think it's still wise to send it to committee.

489
00:49:53,368 --> 00:50:06,333
It's always healthy to have these conversations about topics, but we can also, you know, talk to the chair about these ideas and make sure that we schedule the meetings for when the sponsor is most comfortable to initiate the conversation.

490
00:50:08,732 --> 00:50:09,693
Great, thank you Councillor Saint.

491
00:50:10,494 --> 00:50:11,074
Anybody else?

492
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,636
Public Health and Community Safety.

493
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:23,525
All right, our next one is Public Works and Facilities for major, actually give me one second.

494
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:27,789
I want to be consistent here.

495
00:50:30,663 --> 00:50:51,915
looking at streets, facilities, infrastructure, utilities, departments, our DPW on the kind of the street side with our highway fleet electrical and engineering, a little bit more on the facility side with our facilities manager for street parks, cemetery department, the solid waste contract, Councilor Collins being the foremost expert on this council on that.

496
00:50:53,677 --> 00:50:53,797
And

497
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:58,740
Also, water and sewer, which we know is a huge issue in this community.

498
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:09,823
We have one of the poorest condition water and sewer systems that's going to require the most updating in Massachusetts, and also our information technology department.

499
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:16,585
The major projects we're looking at here are street and sidewalk repair and accessibility.

500
00:51:17,546 --> 00:51:24,152
the street and sidewalk pavement management reports and really understanding what is our implementation schedule.

501
00:51:24,632 --> 00:51:39,504
Are we meeting the recommended funding goals in those reports for not just maintaining the middling level of condition of our streets and sidewalks, but actually trying to really chunk off some significant change there.

502
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:42,607
City facilities and equipment in general,

503
00:51:43,457 --> 00:52:07,914
I know Councilor Sang and Collins and I have been really, and the entire city council as well, but we've had these conversations in our ordinances and rules subcommittee last term around what is the state of all of our capital assets, and what is the cost to restore all of our capital assets to a state of good repair, and we have heard

504
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:12,867
pretty consistently that we can't give you, we don't know.

505
00:52:13,227 --> 00:52:19,892
We do not know the answers to that question and we do not have the resources to put together a process to answer that question.

506
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:37,026
So we have our capital improvement plans, which spend X amount of money over the next five or six fiscal years, but there's no really goal or benchmark target to measure that other than what we have right now for street and sidewalks with the pavement management plan, which is now four fiscal years old.

507
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:37,387
So,

508
00:52:39,048 --> 00:52:40,328
That's a big one.

509
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:43,289
Really need answers there.

510
00:52:43,749 --> 00:52:45,250
Public restrooms and parks and squares.

511
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,610
I move that into a major project.

512
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:48,971
I think that's a major project.

513
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:56,893
I think that's a significant undertaking for this committee and for the city.

514
00:52:58,322 --> 00:53:00,264
And then for ordinances, we had lead ordinance.

515
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,526
We had a home rule petition to increase excise taxes for large trucks.

516
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,869
And then for oversight and engagement, we have public utility accountability.

517
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:12,874
I know our engineer, city engineer, and DPW are constantly working to try to hold public utilities accountable.

518
00:53:13,675 --> 00:53:23,163
The Governor's Municipal Empowerment Act, which was introduced late last week and started at the MMA conference over the weekend,

519
00:53:24,488 --> 00:53:30,414
Would give some some interesting teeth around double poles and some other things that utilities are just flagrantly ignoring.

520
00:53:30,434 --> 00:53:34,358
Our city engineers also working really diligently on.

521
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:42,322
Utilities funding the projects that they've paid for in terms of mitigation for grants of location or the opening of streets.

522
00:53:42,962 --> 00:53:52,626
But there's still more work to do there, given that we know that National Grid is sending, I think, $1 billion a year in profits just from Massachusetts to its Dutch parent company.

523
00:53:52,766 --> 00:53:57,888
So that's the price of privatization that we are all paying.

524
00:53:59,788 --> 00:54:02,249
There's another one, the Tree Planting Volunteer Network.

525
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:05,414
and also reviewing relevant city ordinances and regulations.

526
00:54:05,434 --> 00:54:10,856
So I will go to Councilor Callahan if there's more that you want to talk about here about the public works and facilities committee.

527
00:54:11,637 --> 00:54:12,137
Thank you so much.

528
00:54:12,997 --> 00:54:19,180
Again, I'm excited to dig into these and to work with the committee to prioritize these items.

529
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,982
I do want to say I'm happy to put the public utility accountability if you want to put my name as the lead councilor.

530
00:54:25,002 --> 00:54:25,082
Sure.

531
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:26,863
That's fine.

532
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:30,665
I'm also really grateful for seeing the lead ordinance on there.

533
00:54:31,823 --> 00:54:37,706
That was on all of my original material that I knocked on doors with in May and June.

534
00:54:37,726 --> 00:54:40,788
So I'm very happy to see that there.

535
00:54:40,808 --> 00:54:44,850
Yeah, that's it for me.

536
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:52,614
Yes, and just on a letter of insight, I know that DPW is very interested in doing something there, so that should be exciting.

537
00:54:53,535 --> 00:54:55,696
Anything else on public works and facilities, Councilor Sasse?

538
00:54:56,221 --> 00:55:00,784
Um, I, so I originally submitted the public restrooms in parks and squares here.

539
00:55:01,484 --> 00:55:04,266
Um, and I, I think it does make sense here.

540
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:08,949
Um, but I could also see an argument for being put in public health as well.

541
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:12,090
And so I'm open to that shifting back and forth.

542
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:17,534
Um, I'd be happy to talk to the two chairs and see which one it fits better in.

543
00:55:19,435 --> 00:55:22,957
I do want to say just for my two cents that it, um,

544
00:55:24,915 --> 00:55:35,848
It seems to me that the big questions, there's certainly many kind of red herring arguments about we shouldn't have public restrooms because it's not safe.

545
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,374
But it seems to me that when we are walking into the situation,

546
00:55:41,596 --> 00:55:48,400
At least when I've talked to people who are interested in building them, the bigger concerns, at least in the city side, have been infrastructure and logistics.

547
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:55,844
So that's why I think maybe throwing it in public works makes sense, because it's like, how do we build and maintain these facilities versus.

548
00:55:57,932 --> 00:56:10,641
At least to me, that seems to have been the bigger concern of the major stakeholders, while the kind of not true statements about safety and health have been more reasons to just not build them and use them.

549
00:56:11,122 --> 00:56:17,566
Yeah, I mean, I think with public health, I'm just thinking of, you know, it is a health issue not to be able to use a restroom.

550
00:56:17,767 --> 00:56:17,987
Sure.

551
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:26,210
That's more where I was coming from, but I also, you know, the logistics are very public works based.

552
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:32,292
I know there are community members with proposals floating around for how we can do it in parks.

553
00:56:33,332 --> 00:56:42,435
I also think it'd be really interesting to explore what Somerville and Cambridge have been doing in their squares with their public restrooms as well.

554
00:56:43,395 --> 00:56:43,695
Yes.

555
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:45,396
Any other comments on public restrooms?

556
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:47,877
And then there is a comment online, but I'll go to Councilor Zaro first.

557
00:56:49,088 --> 00:56:54,831
All right, I saw a hand come up during this, so I'll go to Zoom and Matthew Page-Lieberman.

558
00:56:56,632 --> 00:56:58,033
Name and address for the record, please.

559
00:56:58,393 --> 00:57:00,995
This is Matthew Page-Lieberman, 15 Pinal Street.

560
00:57:02,015 --> 00:57:05,677
I really appreciate this talk about the electrical companies, the utilities.

561
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:11,900
Councilor Bares, you mentioned something about the cost of everything being utilized.

562
00:57:12,921 --> 00:57:18,204
And I think, you know, perhaps one day we could consider having municipal energy.

563
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:22,297
There are various cities within Massachusetts that do that.

564
00:57:23,498 --> 00:57:27,302
And we can decide to only purchase renewable energy for the whole city.

565
00:57:27,342 --> 00:57:29,304
That would be a nice thing for us to aim to.

566
00:57:29,424 --> 00:57:29,784
Thank you.

567
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:37,391
Yeah, appreciate the comment.

568
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:38,312
I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

569
00:57:39,192 --> 00:57:41,654
I just wanna make sure that people, that we understood you correctly.

570
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:43,696
You're talking about municipal energy.

571
00:57:44,037 --> 00:57:45,358
It says you broke up a little bit right then.

572
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:46,239
Renewable energy.

573
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,622
Renewable energy or municipal energy.

574
00:57:50,923 --> 00:57:52,424
I think he was talking about municipal energy.

575
00:57:54,306 --> 00:57:56,288
Yeah, which I think is very exciting.

576
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,153
I'm just gonna unmute you again if you wanna clarify, Matthew.

577
00:58:04,617 --> 00:58:05,938
Yes, yeah, there are.

578
00:58:06,598 --> 00:58:10,040
So the energy sector is pretty complicated.

579
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,822
You have energy producers, and then we have these energy sellers.

580
00:58:13,482 --> 00:58:17,544
And we could decide on our end to just be the sellers that distribute it to people's homes.

581
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:18,845
It would be municipally owned.

582
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:22,427
Exactly, you're on the right page, Anna.

583
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:23,828
Sorry, Councillor Callahan.

584
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:30,932
And from that point, we would have some leverage, and we could decide to only distribute to the homes around here renewable energy.

585
00:58:31,738 --> 00:58:36,299
that it's a big project, perhaps, but perhaps it's something that we can aim for.

586
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:39,760
Great, thank you.

587
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:40,480
I appreciate that.

588
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,681
I will go next to Councillor Lazaro.

589
00:58:44,701 --> 00:58:48,722
I had a question about the water and sewer infrastructure in the city.

590
00:58:50,782 --> 00:58:52,022
I know that it's bad.

591
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,383
I guess I'm curious about if

592
00:59:02,608 --> 00:59:05,794
This might be just a conversation, not for right now.

593
00:59:07,056 --> 00:59:10,421
But there aren't, we don't really have anything on here about like,

594
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:29,074
you know, looking into it carefully and like assess, I know, I happen to know two people in town who routinely have their basements flood, like atrociously flooded basements, like ruined everything over and over again, every time it rains in Medford and different parts of the city.

595
00:59:29,314 --> 00:59:32,715
And it's because of the infrastructure on those streets.

596
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:34,236
It's just like not up to date.

597
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:35,357
So, um,

598
00:59:37,137 --> 00:59:54,006
I'm curious about where sort of the city is, it seems like they're aware that it's a problem, if there's anything that we can do to nudge that along, or if there's something that I can suggest now that I'm seeing it laid out in front of me, it kind of occurs to me that that would be, this would be a place to mention it.

599
00:59:55,558 --> 01:00:01,843
Yeah, and if fellow councilors want to chime in as well, my understanding, there's kind of three things here.

600
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:04,405
One, the system is bad because it's old.

601
01:00:04,826 --> 01:00:11,751
It's one of the older systems because a lot of development in the city happened in the early 1900s, and that's when a lot of the systems were laid.

602
01:00:12,352 --> 01:00:18,076
And a lot of the mid-century development happened with subdivisions and private ways.

603
01:00:18,497 --> 01:00:22,260
So the city is not responsible for water and sewer infrastructure on private ways.

604
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:28,584
and a lot of the water and sewer infrastructure on private ways was not built up to the code then, never mind the code today.

605
01:00:29,865 --> 01:00:32,667
So that's one piece of the puzzle.

606
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:48,179
The second piece of it is that my understanding is that the Water and Sewer Commission and the DPW and Superintendent Stoneking are working on a similar assessment to the pavement management assessments for streets and sidewalks for water and sewer.

607
01:00:48,872 --> 01:01:02,699
The third thing is that for a long time, what is called free cash on the city side, the free cash reserve on the city side of the general fund budget is known as retained earnings for this enterprise fund.

608
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:09,021
The water and sewers lives in an enterprise fund separately from most of the other city spending in the general fund.

609
01:01:11,161 --> 01:01:25,171
And most of the time for many, many years, the Water and Sewer Commission recommended and the council approved that retained earnings be used to reduce the rates for water and sewer instead of be used for capital projects and expenditures.

610
01:01:25,732 --> 01:01:33,177
And my understanding is the first time that that didn't happen in a very long time was last year when this council decided we weren't going to do that anymore.

611
01:01:36,983 --> 01:01:41,706
My understanding was also the DPW and the mayor were eventually, probably this year, going to start recommending that we not do that anymore.

612
01:01:41,766 --> 01:01:56,294
But we kind of jumped out a little bit ahead on that last year, somewhat due to procedural reasons, but also due to some discussions in this chamber with the councillors to try to use the retained earnings and keep them for capital improvements.

613
01:01:57,575 --> 01:01:58,716
We've had a bunch of stuff.

614
01:01:58,776 --> 01:02:06,959
I think we approved a loan order in our first meeting for third reading that was a bond order for MWRA loans for the water and sewer department.

615
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,580
We did a big meter replacement.

616
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:23,406
A bunch of ARPA money went to this as well because of it was allowed to by the ARPA laws, which also allows us to use it to do the water main replacement and then also do the street upgrade.

617
01:02:23,927 --> 01:02:25,928
But that's the only way you could use the ARPA money for street upgrades.

618
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:38,840
In any case, that's a long winded answer of it seems like it's being taken very seriously and a new approach is being taken, but we don't know exactly what the requests are going to be of us yet.

619
01:02:39,941 --> 01:02:41,823
And I don't, I haven't seen any sort of reporting.

620
01:02:42,283 --> 01:02:48,609
I don't know if other counselors have had other conversations with DPW or yeah.

621
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:55,040
Does the continued existence of the private ways continue to cause a problem with that?

622
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,961
Because, I mean, I know we have a huge percentage of private ways in town.

623
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:01,762
And are they less regulated still?

624
01:03:02,482 --> 01:03:02,822
Oh, yeah.

625
01:03:03,082 --> 01:03:03,322
Yeah.

626
01:03:04,002 --> 01:03:05,523
They're definitely less regulated still.

627
01:03:05,643 --> 01:03:10,544
I would say that the basement flooding problem, I don't know where these houses are.

628
01:03:11,405 --> 01:03:14,185
There's a lot of water table management issues.

629
01:03:16,721 --> 01:03:23,088
Diverted flow of stormwater, you know issues, especially on private ways because some of them don't have

630
01:03:23,496 --> 01:03:25,537
I can tell you for sure one is probably a private way.

631
01:03:25,577 --> 01:03:28,459
It's in the Heights and the other is, I don't think so.

632
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,382
I don't think it's a private way, but it's it's down in West Medford by the river.

633
01:03:32,422 --> 01:03:43,889
So yeah, there's there's some public ways that don't have storm like we had a whole bunch of meetings last term around the high street issues with the new intersection of high and Woburn changing the water flow patterns.

634
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:51,474
And if you come down high from the safe routes and you loop under, there's no storm water system on that part of the street.

635
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,210
There's issues.

636
01:03:57,411 --> 01:04:09,698
But yeah, the private way thing, and we've had a bunch of meetings, and I would definitely, I'm constantly answering questions about private ways and referring people to the video recordings of these meetings.

637
01:04:12,545 --> 01:04:19,188
the owners of the private ways would have to pay to bring the private ways up to code, and then the city could accept them as public ways and maintain them.

638
01:04:19,248 --> 01:04:21,448
But until that's done, it can't be.

639
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:28,031
Essentially, the abutters to the private way own the private way, and they are responsible for the infrastructure on the private way.

640
01:04:28,651 --> 01:04:34,173
And they would be responsible for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars of infrastructure upgrades.

641
01:04:34,213 --> 01:04:36,074
And it's incredibly burdensome for the homeowners.

642
01:04:36,314 --> 01:04:36,634
Yeah.

643
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:38,835
And that's something I think that really, you know,

644
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:44,252
Realtors selling property on those ways need to be clear that it's like you're not getting.

645
01:04:44,272 --> 01:04:45,593
I live on a private way.

646
01:04:45,613 --> 01:04:46,634
So, yeah, yeah.

647
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:50,857
So, you know, I'm going to go to Councilor Collins, Councilor Calhoun, Councilor, Vice President Collins.

648
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:52,619
Thank you, President Behrs.

649
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:57,102
I appreciate the, the question around this just, and I think that's.

650
01:04:58,844 --> 01:05:01,245
You know, the best encapsulation in terms of.

651
01:05:02,006 --> 01:05:03,948
You know, for the newer counselors in the room in terms of.

652
01:05:05,421 --> 01:05:07,082
the ways that this frequently comes to us.

653
01:05:07,162 --> 01:05:31,931
Certainly, we all have some level of understanding of the problem in its totality and why we're here and for how long it's been going on and the big pieces of why the problem is so widespread, which is our incredibly high percentage of private ways and very old infrastructure and a lot of rehabilitation and renovation that needs to be done and is incredibly expensive that we can't currently right now pay for, capital improvements.

654
01:05:35,157 --> 01:05:51,863
In my experience, how this comes up to the council on a week-by-week, month-by-month basis is residents continue to raise the issue, as is their right, and it's important for us to be a forum for them to come to with questions, whether it's, this keeps happening, who can I talk to?

655
01:05:52,304 --> 01:06:03,348
Or this keeps happening and I live on a private way, and we very frequently have to be the bearer of bad news because it is incredibly financially burdensome to people who live on private ways to do

656
01:06:05,445 --> 01:06:16,890
ideal renovations in many of those cases and it is also financially infeasible for the city at this point to just assume all of those private ways because they have to be brought to code first and that's millions and millions of dollars.

657
01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:26,997
So in my experience, when constituents come to this body and they say, hey, me and my neighbors have been having this problem, it's an opportunity to have a conversation.

658
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:32,081
And we've had that conversation at least many times in the one term that I've served so far.

659
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,842
And it's a way to convey that information.

660
01:06:33,942 --> 01:06:39,707
And I think it's a way to continue to resurface the kind of the bottom line issues that

661
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:50,167
partners in City Hall and the PPW engineering are already working on that is, you know, unfortunately, but necessarily long term projects and deeply involved with the capital future of the city.

662
01:06:54,372 --> 01:06:54,692
Thank you.

663
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:57,075
And I so appreciate this being brought up.

664
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:19,407
Given our discussion right now, and discussions that I had many times at people's doors over the summer and fall, I would love to organize one meeting of this Public Works and Facilities Committee that is devoted to discussing private ways with the public.

665
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:23,513
Hopefully we can have a lot of lead time.

666
01:07:23,533 --> 01:07:30,984
We can also come up with some written understanding of the history of private ways, how they became what they are.

667
01:07:33,957 --> 01:07:39,661
I would love to do something like that, so I don't think we'll do it right away.

668
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:50,049
It's something that will require a lot of preparation for, but I do think that that would be beneficial for our community, for people to be able to come and discuss the issue as a whole with each other.

669
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:58,735
Great, yeah, and I know, thank you, Councillor Collins, for taking some notes on our shared document.

670
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:06,833
If you could submit that and refer it to the subcommittee, I'll just reference.

671
01:08:10,663 --> 01:08:14,206
We've had a few meetings about it over the last two years, so those recordings may be valuable.

672
01:08:14,727 --> 01:08:31,023
There's some information coming from there's some information on the public works website, some information on the police department website, because around the parking and traffic enforcement on private ways, and then certainly commissioner given director Blake are.

673
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:40,426
are knowledgeable resources who could maybe, with a ton of lead, maybe we could take everything that's out there and kind of say, this is private ways in Medford.

674
01:08:41,467 --> 01:08:49,974
I would love to get to the kind of, I think, where you're going down the line of, what would it cost to fix this whole thing?

675
01:08:50,074 --> 01:08:57,519
And, you know, the commission were given a citizen, the hundreds of millions, probably mid hundreds of millions or more.

676
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:07,239
So, and then the one option that we never talk about, because I don't think we would ever do it, but, you know, there's basically 3 things the city could pay to fix it.

677
01:09:07,419 --> 01:09:08,720
And then you're talking about kind of.

678
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:14,347
In my view, a gross misallocation of general public funds for specific private benefit.

679
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:18,532
No offense to the private way residents.

680
01:09:20,749 --> 01:09:25,992
the private way owners could do it themselves and then take it out of their hands.

681
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:31,954
Apparently, also, the city could essentially eminent domain it and charge the abutters.

682
01:09:33,395 --> 01:09:36,076
So I, again, don't think that that's going to happen.

683
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:47,062
Although when I thought about that, I did have the one question, which was, if you did that at scale, would it be significantly cheaper if the city were to

684
01:09:48,502 --> 01:09:58,385
versus it's like the people on the private way are doing it one by one versus you could hire a contractor to do dozens of them every year, would that actually affect the overall cost of the project in a significant way?

685
01:09:58,465 --> 01:10:02,786
But I don't know, and I'd probably not enough to do it, right?

686
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:06,187
So, Councilor Callahan.

687
01:10:06,548 --> 01:10:07,848
I would lean toward a debt exclusion.

688
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:09,639
A debt exclusion.

689
01:10:10,519 --> 01:10:13,601
Like a real big public campaign for a debt exclusion.

690
01:10:13,661 --> 01:10:23,968
Everybody knows exactly what it's for and the public gets to decide whether or not to do that for the people who live in the city and yet do not get a lot of the services that everybody else gets.

691
01:10:24,649 --> 01:10:26,550
Really could be a question of equity.

692
01:10:28,211 --> 01:10:34,275
And then the voters are deciding and we're not doing anything that is not, we're not making the decision.

693
01:10:34,395 --> 01:10:35,215
Voters are making the decision.

694
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:35,696
Yeah.

695
01:10:35,896 --> 01:10:36,116
Yeah.

696
01:10:36,136 --> 01:10:37,377
I mean, I think those are the big,

697
01:10:38,766 --> 01:10:40,587
big questions on the big things.

698
01:10:40,687 --> 01:10:45,030
But I think that's like $500 million question number four on our list.

699
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:49,112
Is that the $64 million question?

700
01:10:49,152 --> 01:10:50,013
Yeah, right.

701
01:10:50,053 --> 01:10:52,915
We're really exceeding 70s game show amounts these days.

702
01:10:56,357 --> 01:10:56,577
Great.

703
01:10:56,637 --> 01:10:58,478
Anything else on public works and facilities?

704
01:11:00,639 --> 01:11:00,959
Cool.

705
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:01,960
Fun discussion.

706
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,942
Last, we'll go to resident services and public engagement.

707
01:11:05,582 --> 01:11:07,904
And we have in this committee,

708
01:11:09,448 --> 01:11:10,528
Give me one second.

709
01:11:10,548 --> 01:11:15,190
It's a long document.

710
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:33,156
Looking at areas of racial justice, disability, elder affairs, veterans affairs, communications, public engagement, elections, departments, diversity, equity, inclusion, council on aging, veteran services, city clerk, veteran community media, communications department, and looking at relevant city ordinances,

711
01:11:33,735 --> 01:11:35,736
Chapter 2, Article 3, Boards and Commissions.

712
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:37,857
Chapter 2, Article 4, Officers and Employees.

713
01:11:38,657 --> 01:11:54,225
We have our major projects of a Multilingual Public Participation Resident Guide, Ordinances, Gender Equity Commission, Youth Commission, Welcoming City Ordinance, Data Equity, Open Data, Immigrants Commission, Language Access Policy or Ordinance, and Human Rights Commission Reform.

714
01:11:55,286 --> 01:11:59,668
And we have Oversight and Engagement, Review Relevant City Ordinances and Regulations.

715
01:12:00,785 --> 01:12:06,908
modernizing the city council communication strategy, which I believe was just on the agenda.

716
01:12:08,188 --> 01:12:16,471
This yesterday, meetings with underrepresented groups, increased public input via open surveys and forms, twice annual training with the DEI office.

717
01:12:16,672 --> 01:12:19,833
So I will at this point turn it over to Councilor Leving.

718
01:12:20,865 --> 01:12:22,046
Um, thank you.

719
01:12:22,066 --> 01:12:39,861
Um, well, there's just a small point about this, but this particular section, so I do very much appreciate my, my colleague counselor sayings, uh, capacity for, for work, but he is listed as the lead counselor on 11 of the 12 projects.

720
01:12:40,582 --> 01:12:47,888
And so I don't have specific recommendations at this time for who should lead which project, but I.

721
01:12:48,488 --> 01:12:57,673
I am of the opinion that perhaps we should spread the work out a little bit more among the committee when designating lead councillors.

722
01:12:57,693 --> 01:13:08,338
I'm also not wholly clear how much we're really committing to the lead councillor for some of the unproposed or some of the ones that have yet to be proposed as well.

723
01:13:09,739 --> 01:13:10,039
Thank you.

724
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,100
Are you going to Councillor Sang?

725
01:13:13,401 --> 01:13:13,741
Thank you.

726
01:13:17,062 --> 01:13:20,251
I'm very appreciative of your sympathy for my workload.

727
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:35,147
I, you know, these, I, a lot of these are ideas that I'm very excited about, some of which I've already started work on, but many of which I have not.

728
01:13:35,528 --> 01:13:42,871
And I'd be very, very happy to distribute the workload if there are counselors who are interested in a lot of these ideas.

729
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:49,755
I know some of them are maybe newer ideas that we haven't talked about in the municipal space here at Medford yet.

730
01:13:51,155 --> 01:13:52,956
A lot of these ideas are,

731
01:13:55,140 --> 01:14:08,806
are ideas that other cities have been doing for a very long time that are just steps towards modernization for our city, but that also means that there's guidelines and frameworks in other cities that we could look at.

732
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:18,070
I believe that this committee can get together and we can distribute the workload if we don't decide tonight who's going to take what.

733
01:14:20,618 --> 01:14:33,545
Now, with that being said, I'd be very happy to help just as a contributor to the multilingual public participation resident guide idea, just because I can translate things in Spanish and French and Chinese.

734
01:14:34,165 --> 01:14:37,907
I know there are counselors who can translate into different languages as well.

735
01:14:38,847 --> 01:14:41,589
I know a lot of a lot of work, I think,

736
01:14:43,717 --> 01:14:57,449
I think residents should understand a lot of this work is really us writing the ordinances, us writing the documents that we want to go out because city staff is so overstretched and under-resourced.

737
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:05,516
And so, you know, as much work as we can share in this, I'd be very happy to share.

738
01:15:06,537 --> 01:15:06,778
Great.

739
01:15:06,978 --> 01:15:08,259
I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

740
01:15:09,735 --> 01:15:10,295
Thank you.

741
01:15:10,435 --> 01:15:22,417
As I was looking through our whole governing framework, I noticed that there wasn't any obvious place to put a lot of the revitalizing our squares work.

742
01:15:22,537 --> 01:15:28,378
And I thought about the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee as a good place where we might be able to do some of those.

743
01:15:28,778 --> 01:15:36,720
I know some of our neighboring cities have, they actually have city run offices that can help local businesses.

744
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:37,840
They have grants for

745
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,441
you know, both exterior and interior design.

746
01:15:41,481 --> 01:15:52,163
They have trainings in, you know, how to, you know, run, you know, employment, and how to run a business, all sorts of things.

747
01:15:52,964 --> 01:15:58,505
And I think that's, I heard so many times from people that we really want to be revitalizing our squares.

748
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:06,307
So one, it's just really a question if there is another place aside from zoning, which I know is going to be, you know, obvious, that's more obvious place.

749
01:16:06,647 --> 01:16:10,030
but if this seems like the right place to put some of those discussions.

750
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:25,642
And then I would love to offer that I will go ahead and make some suggestions for things we might be able to do based on what some other cities have done and ideas that came up during the campaign.

751
01:16:27,644 --> 01:16:31,107
Yeah, just from my thinking, I think you could go to public engagement.

752
01:16:31,127 --> 01:16:31,867
I think that's great.

753
01:16:31,968 --> 01:16:32,208
I think

754
01:16:32,779 --> 01:16:35,561
Planning and permitting is also economic development, so it could go either way.

755
01:16:35,581 --> 01:16:47,289
And I think it's really kind of what's the, you know, what framework is, do you want to apply to the question, and what would you rather be, what kind of frame would you rather be considering it under?

756
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:57,477
The city did, through ARPA, have a facades and revitalization grant program recently, so, but I think it was one-time funding, so.

757
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,081
looking at that.

758
01:17:00,363 --> 01:17:09,274
There's some beautification committee was discussed as well at one point by this council, and I don't know where that went exactly, but those are some of the things that council are saying.

759
01:17:09,355 --> 01:17:12,499
And then I'd like to move us to a vote to refer this out.

760
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:24,151
I believe for beautification it's probably stuck in the committee and I think we probably, I know we passed some resolutions as a council last year, last term.

761
01:17:25,613 --> 01:17:28,796
We could find a place for it somewhere in here as well.

762
01:17:30,558 --> 01:17:52,521
the with regards to revitalizing the square in my opinion a lot of it is zoning related and so with the RFPs that we got with the for the zoning phase two process there are plans to engage the public to hold public meetings to I believe one of the proposals actually gives us the

763
01:17:54,372 --> 01:18:01,339
proper trainings to engage with the public when it comes to zoning as well, to do public input sessions with the audience.

764
01:18:01,419 --> 01:18:14,974
And so, as President Berry said, I think a lot of it is just how we frame this idea of revitalizing the square, revitalizing local squares, because we also have to talk about Haines Square and West Memphis Square and other squares as well.

765
01:18:17,099 --> 01:18:20,840
In my opinion, I think a lot of that is the zoning process.

766
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:31,482
But of course, I think this council would be very happy to entertain ideas in supplement to that.

767
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:36,844
I think I just wanted to touch on the facades idea, but you got that.

768
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:37,664
Great.

769
01:18:39,943 --> 01:18:40,223
Cool.

770
01:18:40,943 --> 01:18:42,844
Well, that's the review of the items.

771
01:18:44,305 --> 01:18:45,386
Yes, Councilor.

772
01:18:45,606 --> 01:18:54,310
There's one idea I just noticed in my notes that I missed that I think would be good for the Education and Culture Committee to discuss.

773
01:18:54,930 --> 01:19:02,534
I would like to work with the administration to see, to identify possible internship opportunities for public school students in Medford.

774
01:19:03,575 --> 01:19:05,976
You know, something that, as a recent young person,

775
01:19:06,636 --> 01:19:22,658
I find very relatable struggle and I think a lot of my friends have gone through is this idea that we're all entering college with a lot of classmates who've had very substantive internship experience in high school, and we have the same potential for work for.

776
01:19:23,579 --> 01:19:29,627
for that type of intellectual growth and that practical experience with our high school students.

777
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:37,397
And I would love us to find opportunities at City Hall and with the city departments to link them with opportunities as well.

778
01:19:37,437 --> 01:19:39,860
But I also know having talked to department heads about

779
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:43,322
possible ideas that some departments don't have the capacity to do it.

780
01:19:43,722 --> 01:19:59,210
And so I really think this would require a big meeting with department heads and with the mayor's office to see what opportunities exist and what are the roadblocks currently for those opportunities.

781
01:19:59,471 --> 01:20:01,272
25 city council interns, that's what I heard.

782
01:20:06,363 --> 01:20:06,723
All right.

783
01:20:08,704 --> 01:20:09,444
Yeah, exactly.

784
01:20:10,344 --> 01:20:10,684
Okay.

785
01:20:11,844 --> 01:20:15,005
We'll have more time to talk about this, but just we're at this end of the section.

786
01:20:15,645 --> 01:20:19,026
Is there a motion to refer this governing agenda to each of the committees?

787
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:23,287
Motion by Councilor Callahan to refer the governing agenda to each of the committees.

788
01:20:23,427 --> 01:20:27,028
Seconded by Councilor Lemming.

789
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:29,889
Mr. Clerk, since we're on Zoom, please call the roll when you're ready.

790
01:20:37,728 --> 01:20:57,518
Councillor JOHNSTON.

791
01:20:57,538 --> 01:21:00,799
Councillor JOHNSTON.

792
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:01,720
Councillor SRI.

793
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,821
Councillor SRI.

794
01:21:05,356 --> 01:21:08,781
Yes, yes, I mean, affirmative another negative motion passes.

795
01:21:09,642 --> 01:21:14,088
Last thing we had was to talk about reviewing this very quickly, or how we want to review this.

796
01:21:14,188 --> 01:21:17,853
So, I see Councilor Collins's hand, so I'll go to Councilor Collins and then Councilor Galliano.

797
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:20,457
Thank you, President Barrett.

798
01:21:22,108 --> 01:21:35,812
Like we talked about at the beginning of the meeting, I think it makes sense for council leadership to keep a relatively close eye on this document and be in communication with committee chairs to make sure that this document stays useful by staying up to date on a reasonable timeline.

799
01:21:35,832 --> 01:21:47,316
So I would motion for council leadership to review this governing agenda monthly and for the full council to review it every six months in late June and late December so that

800
01:21:48,567 --> 01:22:00,015
as a cohort, we are discussing and keeping updated with what's where, how things are progressing, if timelines or goals need to be adjusted, that we're making those decisions as a group twice yearly.

801
01:22:02,437 --> 01:22:02,657
Great.

802
01:22:03,677 --> 01:22:04,438
Councillor Callahan.

803
01:22:05,799 --> 01:22:11,563
I simply wanted to address Councillor George, I mean, Councillor Scarpelli, and say that we miss your cheerful disposition in the chambers.

804
01:22:13,885 --> 01:22:14,686
Come back, George.

805
01:22:15,287 --> 01:22:22,396
And no, George has mentioned to me he has some work stuff, so I really appreciate him being able to be here and be where he is.

806
01:22:23,377 --> 01:22:25,019
I appreciate it, and I apologize.

807
01:22:25,059 --> 01:22:25,880
I wish I was present.

808
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:29,205
This has been a very insightful meeting, so thank you.

809
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:31,179
Thank you.

810
01:22:31,919 --> 01:22:46,103
All right, so on the motion of, is there any further discussion after, we have Councilor Collins' motion that leadership will review this monthly and update it monthly, and then we will sit down in June, December, June and December of this term to review it in committee of the whole.

811
01:22:46,123 --> 01:22:48,704
Is there a second on Councilor Collins' motion?

812
01:22:49,024 --> 01:22:50,224
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

813
01:22:50,684 --> 01:22:53,405
Is there any further discussion on the governing agenda for this evening?

814
01:22:55,505 --> 01:22:57,186
Why don't we make this a motion to adjourn as well?

815
01:22:57,998 --> 01:23:10,769
All right, on the motion that the council will review, leadership will review monthly, committee of the whole is June, December, June, December, and we will adjourn as well by Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Sang.

816
01:23:10,789 --> 01:23:11,689
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

817
01:23:14,492 --> 01:23:14,772
Yes.

818
01:23:16,393 --> 01:23:16,934
Yes.

819
01:23:17,514 --> 01:23:17,694
Yes.

820
01:23:19,736 --> 01:23:19,996
Yes.

821
01:23:22,058 --> 01:23:22,218
Yes.

822
01:23:26,792 --> 01:23:28,794
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

823
01:23:28,834 --> 01:23:31,196
The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
