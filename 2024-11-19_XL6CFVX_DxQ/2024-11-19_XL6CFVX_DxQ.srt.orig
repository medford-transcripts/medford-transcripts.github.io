00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:32,138
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone like to speak in favor of the petition?

86
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,322
[SPEAKER_37]: Yep, let's see, we have Chief of Staff, Dave Rodriguez.

87
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:48,746
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Mr. President, and sorry, I was looking for the raise hand function, I couldn't find it, so I just did it the old fashioned way.

88
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:58,110
[SPEAKER_58]: I appreciate the comments that were made by the Community Development Board, their careful consideration that was made after a number of meetings that were constructive and

89
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,472
[SPEAKER_58]: of thoughtful and very substantive.

90
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:04,896
[SPEAKER_58]: And the mayor agrees with the changes that are recommended by this community development board.

91
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:12,963
[SPEAKER_58]: She thinks that it achieves the policy objectives that were put forth and spurred off a good conversation that happened at the city board at that time.

92
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:15,726
[SPEAKER_58]: So we hope the council will give it careful consideration as well.

93
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,769

94
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,832

[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

96
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:34,451
[SPEAKER_37]: Now I open this up to anyone in opposition of the petition.

97
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:36,853
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone in opposition that would like to speak?

98
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I see someone has a hand up.

99
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:54,265
[SPEAKER_16]: Navarro?

100
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:55,265
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, Will.

101
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:55,746
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

102
00:09:58,061 --> 00:09:58,641
[SPEAKER_37]: One minute, please.

103
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,363
[SPEAKER_37]: Please have your name and address for the record.

104
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:06,023
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you, Mr. President.

105
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:07,064
[SPEAKER_56]: I hope you can hear me.

106
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:08,704
[SPEAKER_56]: Great.

107
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,386
[SPEAKER_56]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

108
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:22,709
[SPEAKER_56]: The goal as I understand this, Mr. President, and I might not be super familiar with the changes.

109
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:29,670
[SPEAKER_56]: I'm not sure if we're still considering whether or not it'll be an apartment one and an apartment two, but I'm commenting as if it is that.

110
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:35,191
[SPEAKER_56]: The goal as I understand it is to increase the commercial tax base.

111
00:10:36,872 --> 00:10:39,052
[SPEAKER_56]: I have major equity concerns with that.

112
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:44,693
[SPEAKER_56]: The present system of taxation gives a discount to housing owners,

113
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,007
[SPEAKER_56]: by taxing housing land and housing improvements at a lower rate than ones that are commercial.

114
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:59,879
[SPEAKER_56]: However, on the other side of that, it provides an incentive to create housing that housing seekers will enjoy.

115
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,942
[SPEAKER_56]: And this seems to subvert that.

116
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:05,307
[SPEAKER_56]: housing owners continue to get their discount.

117
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:14,639
[SPEAKER_56]: And it's really tough for housing seekers to have supply built for them because you got to put in commercial in order to do that.

118
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,424
[SPEAKER_56]: So I'm a little bit concerned that this is going to hamper housing production.

119
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,207
[SPEAKER_56]: All right.

120
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:37,199
[SPEAKER_56]: And I would suggest the alternative proposal that if the city wants to see more commercial go in, they consider removing that disincentive to commercial, the higher mill rate, which encourages you to put in housing rather than commercial.

121
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:41,359
[SPEAKER_56]: You can just look at some of the assessments, Mr. President.

122
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:52,846
[SPEAKER_56]: You can see that even though the bill rate is nominally higher in commercial, you can see that as a relation to land value, this is sort of what you start with and you hope they build up.

123
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:59,630
[SPEAKER_56]: You can see that the commercial properties often pay a smaller ratio of their land value in taxes.

124
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,732
[SPEAKER_56]: And that's because some commercial is not very developed.

125
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:05,714
[SPEAKER_56]: An obvious example would be on Mystic Avenue.

126
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:13,735
[SPEAKER_56]: But the new housing is, of course, well-developed, with lots of assessed improvements at each dollar of assessed land value.

127
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:30,451
[SPEAKER_56]: Even at Wellington Plaza, where it's legitimately developed, it's not an empty lot, at 760 Fells Way, I think that's where the stop and shop is, sort of that wing of the plaza.

128
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:38,794
[SPEAKER_56]: They pay less as a ratio of land value than the housing across the way at Five Cabot.

129
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:44,336
[SPEAKER_56]: You might say that's a luxury development, but that means that they're paying a lot of improvement taxes.

130
00:12:46,067 --> 00:13:04,001
[SPEAKER_56]: So when you get down to it, if you want to extract more from commercial, you can often do that just by having a flat land value tax, where you don't tax extra for the homeowners and the apartment owners for having buildings, you tax based on the value of the land that they deprive to others.

131
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:11,367
[SPEAKER_56]: And since the rate is flat, and no matter what you put there, you pay the same amount of tax, that creates a free field with no favor.

132
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:14,262
[SPEAKER_56]: All right.

133
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:15,023
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

134
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:19,947
[SPEAKER_56]: We're going to take away the incentive to leave land unproductive, vacant or blighted.

135
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:27,253
[SPEAKER_56]: The tax would furthermore encourage the owners of land on Mystic Avenue to sell it or develop it.

136
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:32,237
[SPEAKER_56]: And that's true whether or not the city decides to rezone it residential.

137
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:35,180
[SPEAKER_56]: They don't have to pay much taxes right now.

138
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,143
[SPEAKER_56]: They can wait and wait and wait until you rezone it residential.

139
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:41,966
[SPEAKER_56]: And some people don't want to do that and that's fine.

140
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:44,968
[SPEAKER_56]: They got to do something.

141
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:54,051
[SPEAKER_56]: A land value tax doesn't even need to be a sudden and abrupt change that's got to cause chaos or anything.

142
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,512
[SPEAKER_56]: You can do it slowly.

143
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:58,613
[SPEAKER_56]: Maybe one year the taxes are going up a bit.

144
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:00,773
[SPEAKER_56]: You put all the increase on the land.

145
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:02,594
[SPEAKER_56]: Maybe they're going down a bit.

146
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:05,895
[SPEAKER_56]: You take off the decrease off buildings.

147
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:09,296
[SPEAKER_56]: So it doesn't have to be a sudden change that shocks the system.

148
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:28,662
[SPEAKER_56]: We need, and I should say that generally when you do that, homeowners, especially lower income homeowners and lower income neighborhoods generally get more of a tax break and less of a tax hike when you do it that way, rather than flat on each.

149
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:32,743
[SPEAKER_56]: So it's not through this, the increase for homeowners, it's usually a decrease.

150
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:40,576
[SPEAKER_56]: We do need more commercial city of Medford, but we also need more housing in the city of Medford.

151
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:55,282
[SPEAKER_56]: And we can get more of both by removing the tax break for those who hold land out of use in the form of parking lots, vacant lots, and low intensity businesses like the sprawling large car dealerships that are really glorified parking lots on Mystic Avenue.

152
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,543
[SPEAKER_56]: That's how we can get more commercial in our city.

153
00:14:57,723 --> 00:15:03,585
[SPEAKER_56]: That's how we can get more housing in the city by using the land productively, by removing the discount for blight.

154
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:13,775
[SPEAKER_56]: and waste, and most of all, speculation as you wait for the city to improve around you to become richer or for the city council to rezone.

155
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:22,622
[SPEAKER_56]: They should build what it's zoned for, they should build commercial Mystic Valley, and they shouldn't be holding land hostage waiting for that.

156
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:24,524
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you, Mr. President.

157
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,045
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Mr. Navarro.

158
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,187
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, we have...

159
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:37,213
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

160
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:44,682
[SPEAKER_62]: Hello 46 Otis Street in Medford on I understand that we need to do zoning changes, Mr. President.

161
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:52,752
[SPEAKER_62]: But first of all, I don't think that this should be happening in the middle of the summer and the middle of a pandemic when we can't even all be in the same room.

162
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:58,695
[SPEAKER_62]: There are people that wanted to be part of this meeting tonight, but they can't communicate via a screen.

163
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:09,220
[SPEAKER_62]: So if at some point you decide to put this off to another date, there are people that have valuable information to add to this that would like to be in the council chambers and do so in person.

164
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:19,384
[SPEAKER_62]: What I will say is the way that this is written to bring commercial into apartment 1, apartment 2, or apartment 3 zones, I will tell you some of the apartment 1 zones.

165
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:24,586
[SPEAKER_62]: If you're going up Oakland Street, which is across the street from City Hall, that's all houses.

166
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:27,528
[SPEAKER_62]: But the right side of that is apartment 1 zoning.

167
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:33,030
[SPEAKER_62]: If I lived up there, I would not want stores or commercial property put in there.

168
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,692
[SPEAKER_62]: If you go down Riverside Avenue underneath the bridge from Medford Square,

169
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:41,113
[SPEAKER_62]: The right side of that is apartment one zoning.

170
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:43,474
[SPEAKER_62]: I wouldn't want stores all over there.

171
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:51,217
[SPEAKER_62]: When we go down Main Street in Medford, we're talking apartment one and apartment two zones, and it just doesn't work for that.

172
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:58,200
[SPEAKER_62]: As far as the mixed use zoning districts, Medford Square, we've been asking for mixed use zoning for 30 years.

173
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,261
[SPEAKER_62]: I would love for that to be part of this amendment here.

174
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:04,702
[SPEAKER_62]: that we can have apartments as well as commercial.

175
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:15,664
[SPEAKER_62]: And it's not that we're trying to take away things, but we have a lot of vacant storefronts across our city, and you're going to see a lot more due to COVID in people working from home.

176
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:20,625
[SPEAKER_62]: I love the recommendations from the Community Development Board, except for one.

177
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:31,208
[SPEAKER_62]: I don't think that you should require the commercial to be ground level, because maybe the commercial piece is something that's on the same lot, like what we're seeing across the street from Wegmans,

178
00:17:31,628 --> 00:17:33,129
[SPEAKER_62]: We still have a bank on the lot.

179
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:37,771
[SPEAKER_62]: Maybe that bank makes up that 25% that is needed in that zone.

180
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:53,920
[SPEAKER_62]: The other thing that we're seeing is a lot of the apartment houses and the complexes that are being built are talking with companies like WeWork, and maybe that's on the sixth floor, but it's a level of commercial property for people to be able to work at home.

181
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,640
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you.

182
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:56,521
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you.

183
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:02,722
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone else against?

184
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:03,744
[SPEAKER_37]: In opposition?

185
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:06,667
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, we have Derek Anderson.

186
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:11,573
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

187
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:14,337
[SPEAKER_54]: Oh, Derek Anderson, 16 Myrtle Street.

188
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:17,565
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you, Mr. President.

189
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:19,305
[SPEAKER_54]: I am against this proposal.

190
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:22,606
[SPEAKER_54]: I would like to second a lot of what Kelly has just said.

191
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:24,987
[SPEAKER_54]: Mixed use is very important for our community.

192
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:27,887
[SPEAKER_54]: Adding more commercial is very important.

193
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:34,489
[SPEAKER_54]: I love the idea of having commercial in some of those apartment zones and commercial zones that are affected by this amendment.

194
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:38,090
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm thinking particularly along Salem Street, a great place for it.

195
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,013
[SPEAKER_54]: But there are places that are affected by this amendment.

196
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:44,155
[SPEAKER_54]: Kelly's mentioned a number of them.

197
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:52,962
[SPEAKER_54]: I think Riverside Ave, everything along Riverside Ave from downtown Medford to Locust Street, from Riverside Ave to the river would be affected by this.

198
00:18:53,042 --> 00:19:04,092
[SPEAKER_54]: So there would be no multi dwelling apartments greater than two units, unless it's an attached single family home that would be allowed in that entire section of town from now on, unless they put in 25% commercial.

199
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:07,497
[SPEAKER_54]: There just aren't developers out there that are going to build that kind of stuff.

200
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:12,583
[SPEAKER_54]: This is a ban on multi-dwelling housing in a number of areas of our city.

201
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:22,734
[SPEAKER_54]: It's completely inappropriate to try to have this sort of quick fix zoning amendment to what is really begging for a comprehensive zoning process.

202
00:19:22,774 --> 00:19:26,017
[SPEAKER_54]: And I know that our community development group is doing a housing plan.

203
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:36,482
[SPEAKER_54]: resilience plan, they're going out for comprehensive planning, all those things can feed into real zoning reform, and I'm optimistic that that can happen.

204
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,045
[SPEAKER_54]: But we need to let that process unfold.

205
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:44,009
[SPEAKER_54]: This kind of quick fix is going to have lots of unforeseen issues.

206
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:56,490
[SPEAKER_54]: And I'm extremely concerned, particularly that there's a requirement for city council to approve, case by case, every single application that's proposed for multi-dwelling.

207
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,871
[SPEAKER_54]: That's a huge change from where we're at right now.

208
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,933
[SPEAKER_54]: It's totally inappropriate to put city council in that place.

209
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,854
[SPEAKER_54]: I assume that you guys don't wanna be put in that position.

210
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:10,777
[SPEAKER_54]: I certainly wouldn't wanna be put in that position of having politics inserted into every single application.

211
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,618
[SPEAKER_54]: And it's just the wrong way to go about this.

212
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,330
[SPEAKER_54]: Point of information Councilor Knight.

213
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,194
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a public hearing in favor or against.

214
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:22,656
[SPEAKER_43]: It should be ended.

215
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:24,277
[SPEAKER_43]: We have 35 items on the agenda.

216
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:31,624
[SPEAKER_43]: If we allow the dialogue to continue for four or five minutes on every item on the agenda this evening, we're going to be here until tomorrow morning.

217
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:34,147
[SPEAKER_43]: I appreciate what Mr. Anderson has to say and I agree with him.

218
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,109
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm not going to be supporting the zoning amendment this evening.

219
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,070
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm going to vote to reject it.

220
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:39,296
[SPEAKER_43]: for the reasons that I stated when it was introduced.

221
00:20:40,096 --> 00:20:47,721
[SPEAKER_43]: However, in the interest of getting through the agenda, Mr. President, I think it might be important for us to maybe limit the time of public participation this evening.

222
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:49,382
[SPEAKER_43]: We have 35 items on the agenda.

223
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:51,963
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, that's all right.

224
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,545
[SPEAKER_33]: Derek, did you want to conclude?

225
00:20:56,377 --> 00:21:01,281
[SPEAKER_54]: Sure, and I appreciate your position, Councilor Knight, and I apologize for taking a lot of time.

226
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:02,622
[SPEAKER_54]: I am passionate on this.

227
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:06,125
[SPEAKER_54]: I'll just conclude, it's inappropriate to have City Council involved in this.

228
00:21:06,486 --> 00:21:09,088
[SPEAKER_54]: This is a citywide ban that's totally inappropriate.

229
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:10,149
[SPEAKER_54]: This is not the way to do it.

230
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:11,069
[SPEAKER_54]: We do need commercial.

231
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,853
[SPEAKER_54]: I like the intent, but the implementation is wrong, and I'm against this.

232
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:18,976
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you very much, appreciate it.

233
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:20,758
[SPEAKER_37]: Is anyone else in opposition of this?

234
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:24,741
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone else in opposition that would like to speak?

235
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:31,934
[SPEAKER_59]: Motion to close the public air.

236
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:33,574
[SPEAKER_37]: We have one more person.

237
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,916
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see you, Roberta Cameron.

238
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:36,856
[SPEAKER_37]: Would you like to speak?

239
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:42,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you.

240
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to mention one thing that I'm concerned about the the

241
00:21:51,029 --> 00:22:01,838
[SPEAKER_10]: the uses that would be allowed within those districts are not necessarily the uses that are compatible with our vision of what mixed use looks like.

242
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:18,191
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that the underlying commercial uses that would be required to be located, co-located with commercial, with residential buildings are not necessarily the uses that would be compatible with that type of building.

243
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,515
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to add that to the argument.

244
00:22:22,756 --> 00:22:23,976
[SPEAKER_40]: Was that opposed, Mr. President?

245
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, opposed.

246
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:25,856
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

247
00:22:27,316 --> 00:22:27,977
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Roberta.

248
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:32,097
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone else in opposition?

249
00:22:32,877 --> 00:22:34,438
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone in opposition that would like to speak?

250
00:22:37,258 --> 00:22:37,698
[SPEAKER_37]: OK.

251
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:42,639
[SPEAKER_37]: Hearing and seeing none, I will this portion of the hearing close.

252
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,260
[SPEAKER_37]: Now I'll ask if the council has any questions or comments that they'd like to make.

253
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,580
[SPEAKER_40]: Motion to reject the zoning amendment, Mr. President.

254
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:55,321
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight to reject the zoning amendments.

255
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,162
[SPEAKER_49]: Second, Council President.

256
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,102
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

257
00:23:00,222 --> 00:23:01,323
[SPEAKER_37]: Any questions from the Council?

258
00:23:06,664 --> 00:23:07,204
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President?

259
00:23:07,544 --> 00:23:08,644
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, okay, Councilor Marks.

260
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:10,445
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Mr. President.

261
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:26,231
[SPEAKER_44]: You know, we are in the process, as many residents know, we hired an attorney to help us with our review of our zoning ordinances that haven't been reviewed in over 30 years.

262
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:32,676
[SPEAKER_44]: I think many people in this community realize that there are many changes that need to happen, many updates.

263
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:39,021
[SPEAKER_44]: And I would agree with some of the previous speakers that we really do need to look at a comprehensive amendment.

264
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:42,163
[SPEAKER_44]: And I appreciate the fact that the mayor is trying to

265
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:45,867
[SPEAKER_44]: put forward what she believes is in the best interest of the community.

266
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:54,115
[SPEAKER_44]: However, I'd like to look at a total picture when I arrive at a decision, and I don't believe this arrives at that.

267
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,419
[SPEAKER_44]: There is an issue, Mr. President, I've raised on many times.

268
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:12,252
[SPEAKER_44]: before the council and regarding zoning is the fact that we're seeing many buildings pop up that have very little community feel and community impact other than providing additional housing.

269
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:19,218
[SPEAKER_44]: And I've always stated, Mr. President, that we have to make sure that we're not just creating big blocks

270
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:24,222
[SPEAKER_44]: residential places that really have no community feel.

271
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:40,034

00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:41,349
[SPEAKER_37]: Any disturbed concrete sidewalk panels shall be replaced in kind.

413
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:44,191
[SPEAKER_37]: Asphalt must be replaced with asphalt.

414
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:53,006
[SPEAKER_37]: Five, the sidewalk and street temporary and permit restoration shall be done in consultation with the engineering division and per the requirements.

415
00:36:53,772 --> 00:36:55,953
[SPEAKER_37]: of an approved street opening permit.

416
00:36:56,473 --> 00:37:07,516
[SPEAKER_37]: The recent resurfacing of Boston Avenue stopped short of this location due to the anticipated and ongoing construction related to both Tufts University projects and the Green Line Extension project.

417
00:37:08,316 --> 00:37:17,238
[SPEAKER_37]: Also, the City of Medford intends to add a pedestrian crossing in this vicinity using funds obtained from the MBTA related to mitigation for the GLX project.

418
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:31,214
[SPEAKER_37]: The engineering division recommends that in lieu of performing final street restoration, a contribution be negotiated and agreed upon with the city engineer that approximates the construction cost value of finished street restoration.

419
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,675
[SPEAKER_37]: The cost should take into consideration.

420
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:51,843
[SPEAKER_37]: in consideration roadway mill and overlay restoration with a curb-to-curb offset of 25 feet, including setting curb stones and sidewalk restoration and mill and overlay restoration encompassing Tufts University utility patches from the intersection of College Avenue to the limits of Dolan Hall.

421
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:58,045
[SPEAKER_37]: This contribution will go towards final resurfacing of this section of Boston Avenue.

422
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:03,868
[SPEAKER_37]: This will provide a consistent final pavement surface along this section of Boston Avenue.

423
00:38:04,468 --> 00:38:07,350
[SPEAKER_37]: Number six, pavement markings must be restored.

424
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:16,216
[SPEAKER_37]: Number seven, the project site must be swept daily and shall be kept free of debris for the duration of the installation.

425
00:38:17,017 --> 00:38:26,603
[SPEAKER_37]: Number eight, a copy of the MWRA permit and associated plans must be submitted to the engineering division prior to releasing a street opening permit.

426
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:31,507
[SPEAKER_37]: Number nine, the plan indicates open trench construction

427
00:38:31,957 --> 00:38:39,139
[SPEAKER_37]: There is existing concrete barrier structure and cable guardrail that must be removed for the installation of the transmission line.

428
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,101
[SPEAKER_37]: These two elements should not be replaced.

429
00:38:42,141 --> 00:38:54,065
[SPEAKER_37]: The engineering division recommends that the petitioner coordinates sidewalk surface restoration with the Greenline Extension Project as there is sidewalk scope for that project on the east side of Boston Avenue.

430
00:38:54,485 --> 00:38:57,926
[SPEAKER_37]: Any temporary restoration must meet accessibility standards.

431
00:38:58,326 --> 00:39:00,587
[SPEAKER_37]: The sidewalk on the west side is likely to remain

432
00:39:01,363 --> 00:39:05,665
[SPEAKER_37]: and should be permanently restored to concrete upon completion of the crossing.

433
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:13,869
[SPEAKER_37]: Approved by the Superintendent of Wires, call 781-393-2425 for any accommodations and or aids.

434
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:21,873
[SPEAKER_37]: Plans can be reviewed at the City Clerk's Office, 781-393-2425, Adam L. Herterbe's City Clerk.

435
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:26,575
[SPEAKER_37]: I declare this public hearing open, open to those in favor of the petition.

436
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:29,937
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone that would like to speak in favor of the petition?

437
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,346
[SPEAKER_37]: Rocco, I'm trying to unmute you now.

438
00:39:39,466 --> 00:39:39,986
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, there we go.

439
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,747
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

440
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:43,447
[SPEAKER_19]: Rocco DiRico.

441
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:48,608
[SPEAKER_19]: Work address is 14 Capen Street in Medford at Tufts University.

442
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:50,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

443
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:52,729
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, members of the City Council and neighbors.

444
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:54,989
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Rocco DiRico.

445
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:57,809
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the Director of Government and Community Relations at Tufts University.

446
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:06,251
[SPEAKER_19]: We are here to seek a grant of location permit to connect a new academic building that we're building, the Cummings Center.

447
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:09,157
[SPEAKER_19]: to our central energy plant.

448
00:40:09,177 --> 00:40:12,580
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a utility connection for the Cumming Center.

449
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:18,644
[SPEAKER_19]: As some of you may know, Tufts University has set the ambitious goal of being carbon neutral by 2050.

450
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:24,789
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've built our own central energy plant to help with that goal.

451
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:34,476
[SPEAKER_19]: And what we'd like to do, if approved, we'll dig a trench underneath Boston Avenue to lay conduit cables connecting the central energy plant to the Cumming Center.

452
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:48,108
[SPEAKER_19]: This also has the additional benefit of connecting Halligan Hall, Cousins Gym, the Tisch Fitness Center, and Gancher to our central energy plant, as the other buildings on our campus are attached to.

453
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:55,540
[SPEAKER_19]: If approved, the project can start in August and will take about three to four weeks.

454
00:40:56,601 --> 00:41:02,326
[SPEAKER_19]: The working hours will be normal working hours, Monday through Saturday, between 7 AM and 6 PM.

455
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:05,428
[SPEAKER_19]: Boston Avenue will remain open.

456
00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:09,712
[SPEAKER_19]: There may be times when we need to close one lane and close the other lane, but it will remain open.

457
00:41:10,418 --> 00:41:11,478
[SPEAKER_19]: throughout the project.

458
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:19,821
[SPEAKER_19]: Our goal is to complete the project before Labor Day, before schools reopen and there's increased traffic in the area.

459
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:29,284
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had a robust communications plan for the Cummings Center, and this is part of the project.

460
00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:32,685
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had eight community meetings on this project.

461
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,065
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a public website for the project.

462
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,927
[SPEAKER_19]: I meet with a neighborhood working group that's made up of neighbors once a month.

463
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:43,396
[SPEAKER_19]: We also send monthly email updates to our neighbors.

464
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:48,339
[SPEAKER_19]: I've had several meetings, phone calls, and emails to neighbors about this project.

465
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:59,284
[SPEAKER_19]: And on this particular grant of location request, I have called and or emailed everyone on the abutters list in preparation for tonight's meeting.

466
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:05,246
[SPEAKER_19]: I am joined tonight by Ruth Bennett, who is our director of strategic capital programs.

467
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:08,288
[SPEAKER_19]: And we also have our contractors here tonight,

468
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:13,926
[SPEAKER_19]: council or the audience have any questions about the project.

469
00:42:16,188 --> 00:42:16,988
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Rocco.

470
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:20,111
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak in favor of this project?

471
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:20,432
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

472
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:33,643
[SPEAKER_38]: If you could please have your... Aaron, I'm trying to unmute you.

473
00:42:34,043 --> 00:42:34,384
[SPEAKER_38]: There we go.

474
00:42:36,368 --> 00:42:37,229
[SPEAKER_42]: Everyone must hate this.

475
00:42:37,509 --> 00:42:38,210
[SPEAKER_42]: She can't talk.

476
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,011
[SPEAKER_42]: She's being muted.

477
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:40,392
[SPEAKER_42]: This is the first time it's happened.

478
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:45,977
[SPEAKER_37]: What everyone's like, I'm trying to unmute you.

479
00:42:46,017 --> 00:42:47,599
[SPEAKER_37]: It doesn't seem I gotta go.

480
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

481
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:58,209
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, no.

482
00:42:58,269 --> 00:42:59,089
[SPEAKER_38]: Are you trying to unmute?

483
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:00,311
[SPEAKER_38]: No.

484
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:00,611
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

485
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:10,275
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, everyone, for your patience.

486
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:12,056
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, this is the public hearing portion.

487
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:14,538
[SPEAKER_42]: It's either opposed or against, right?

488
00:43:15,118 --> 00:43:15,378
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

489
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:23,545
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone else that wants to speak in favor of this project?

490
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:42,514
[SPEAKER_37]: Aaron, I can't get you to, I'm trying to unmute you and it won't let me.

491
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:44,856
[SPEAKER_29]: Aaron.

492
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:49,100
[SPEAKER_29]: Something should come up on your screen when he presses the button that says unmute.

493
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,000
[SPEAKER_29]: There you go, you're unmuted.

494
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,001
[SPEAKER_28]: You're unmuted.

495
00:43:51,822 --> 00:43:52,723
[SPEAKER_28]: I was trying to do that.

496
00:43:52,743 --> 00:43:54,844
[SPEAKER_28]: It wasn't allowing me and then they asked me not to.

497
00:43:54,984 --> 00:43:56,566
[SPEAKER_28]: But anyway, Aaron DeBenedetto, 21.

498
00:43:56,726 --> 00:43:57,907
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have one, three?

499
00:43:58,307 --> 00:44:06,874
[SPEAKER_28]: First of all, I'm all for putting more of the energy through their power system as long as it's

500
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:11,345
[SPEAKER_28]: quiet, and it has been for quite a bit.

501
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:23,455
[SPEAKER_28]: I also need to comment that the construction that's going on up across right now, they're not being neat with keeping things off the street.

502
00:44:23,616 --> 00:44:31,783
[SPEAKER_28]: Even tonight as I walked by, there was piles of sand and rock in the street with cones wrapped around it.

503
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:37,355
[SPEAKER_28]: and some trash bags behind a barrier that really doesn't, that barrier doesn't need to be there.

504
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:51,682
[SPEAKER_28]: I've called a couple of city counselors and Vice President Rick Caviello has been very helpful in getting them to clear that area so the street stays wide and safe for both pedestrians and cars.

505
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:59,085
[SPEAKER_37]: I apologize for interrupting, but we need to keep on topic with this project here.

506
00:44:59,545 --> 00:45:07,995
[SPEAKER_28]: It goes to speak as just when they're doing the Boston Ave project, I hope that they keep that area safe and clean as they do it.

507
00:45:08,135 --> 00:45:14,342
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a great improvement for their community, but while they're building, they need to be aware of the hillside community.

508
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,003
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, I would like to be re-added to the emails that Rocco mentioned.

509
00:45:20,383 --> 00:45:23,165
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to be clear that not all- What information, Mr. President?

510
00:45:23,725 --> 00:45:25,306
[SPEAKER_37]: What information, Councilor Layton?

511
00:45:25,546 --> 00:45:26,567
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a public hearing.

512
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:29,529
[SPEAKER_43]: It's either we're in opposition or we're in favor of the project.

513
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:34,452
[SPEAKER_43]: We go, again, I understand we're coming from Marion, but we have 35 items on the agenda.

514
00:45:34,492 --> 00:45:37,213
[SPEAKER_43]: If we continue down this road, we're going to be here all evening.

515
00:45:37,293 --> 00:45:41,896
[SPEAKER_43]: The common practice that's always been with the council has been public hearing in favor or opposed.

516
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:44,598
[SPEAKER_43]: When we've had people come to the podium in the council meetings, we've told them,

517
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:47,641
[SPEAKER_43]: Stop, public hearing in favor or opposed.

518
00:45:48,902 --> 00:45:51,384
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, I respect that Councilor Knight.

519
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:55,889
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanted to make sure that the project is safe for the residents as well.

520
00:45:56,169 --> 00:45:57,350
[SPEAKER_28]: So yes, I'm in favor.

521
00:45:57,731 --> 00:45:59,452
[SPEAKER_37]: Perfect, thank you very much Sharon.

522
00:45:59,472 --> 00:46:02,896
[SPEAKER_37]: Does anybody else that would like to speak in favor of the project?

523
00:46:13,362 --> 00:46:13,962
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you very much.

524
00:46:14,203 --> 00:46:15,083
[SPEAKER_60]: My name is Laurel Ruma.

525
00:46:15,463 --> 00:46:21,687
[SPEAKER_60]: I live at 149 Burgett Avenue, directly behind the current Cummings building and the proposed construction.

526
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:38,276
[SPEAKER_60]: So I had a number of qualifying questions that needed sort of a quorum to be answered, including, I'm assuming Tufts now has permanent access easement under Boston Avenue, and I'd like to know what payment structure the university worked out with the city for that permanent access.

527
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:50,112
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. President, I do believe granted locations and personal property tax are attached to any type of grant location in the underground infrastructure that they put in through the assessor's office.

528
00:46:51,693 --> 00:47:01,035
[SPEAKER_43]: And I do believe that that itemization is determined after they complete the work and construct what it is that they need to construct so that we can tax it appropriately.

529
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,611
[SPEAKER_60]: Okay, so I understand that also the payment for the new sidewalks will be deferred and so the green line construction is put in.

530
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:12,417
[SPEAKER_60]: I would just like to make the point that this neighborhood does need very specific

531
00:47:13,058 --> 00:47:15,520
[SPEAKER_60]: enhancements, including dead end signs.

532
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:26,409
[SPEAKER_60]: We need a parking mitigation plan, but most importantly, we would like Tufts to withhold some of that money and buy curtains or blinds or drapes for the building so the lights don't shine into the neighborhood.

533
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:32,174
[SPEAKER_60]: As of now, we're already looking at a massive light pollution, and it only has construction lights up.

534
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:39,040
[SPEAKER_60]: So I just want to make clear that the neighborhood is very aware that this is a continual encroachment and building of the Tufts

535
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,163
[SPEAKER_60]: so-called athletic utility district and we are still the rest of the city living here.

536
00:47:44,544 --> 00:47:48,927
[SPEAKER_60]: So we too would like attention paid to this neighborhood.

537
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:51,268
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you very much.

538
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:56,512
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak in favor of the petition?

539
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:09,158
[SPEAKER_37]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

540
00:48:09,618 --> 00:48:14,080
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone that would like to speak in opposition of the petition?

541
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,401
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone in opposition?

542
00:48:29,545 --> 00:48:33,006
[SPEAKER_37]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

543
00:48:33,046 --> 00:48:34,707
[SPEAKER_37]: Are there any questions from the council?

544
00:48:36,343 --> 00:48:37,344
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, Councilor Morrell.

545
00:48:38,305 --> 00:48:39,246
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

546
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,527
[SPEAKER_31]: Rocco, thanks for being here.

547
00:48:40,547 --> 00:48:50,015
[SPEAKER_31]: And I know we talked yesterday about this, but I just wanted, if you could address just for the public and the rest of the councilors how the anticipated length of this work and project from start to finish.

548
00:48:57,642 --> 00:48:59,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

549
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:02,464
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, after six months of Zoom, I'm still figuring this out.

550
00:49:03,725 --> 00:49:09,170

00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:29,657

00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:31,418
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, I'm sorry, Counselor Scott Pelley.

00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:46,085
[SPEAKER_37]: That's what I was going to say.

560
00:49:46,345 --> 00:49:46,925
[SPEAKER_33]: Actually, he's right here.

561
00:49:48,366 --> 00:49:49,166
[SPEAKER_36]: Counselor Scott Pelley.

562
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:51,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

563
00:49:53,244 --> 00:49:56,466

[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Mr. President.

569
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:18,955
[SPEAKER_44]: I would ask that the city of Method and Tufts University put together a list of contacts for area residents, a clerk of the work that would be responsible for the project, and any questions that residents may have.

570
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:21,817
[SPEAKER_37]: Would you like to add that as an amendment?

571
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:23,479
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, yes.

572
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,421

574
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:30,945
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm still working on Councilor Marks' amendment.

575
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:40,192
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks, you're asking the Tufts and the city put together a list of, and I lost you there, it got a little garbled on my end.

576
00:50:40,632 --> 00:50:50,821
[SPEAKER_44]: A list of project contact names and numbers, as well as the city of Method to have a clerk of the works that is responsible for the project.

577
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,914
[SPEAKER_44]: And I know Mr. DeRico said he has a list of abutters and so forth.

578
00:50:57,375 --> 00:51:05,482
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm sure he can disseminate some information that way and the city can also add it to its city website and local community access as well.

579
00:51:06,343 --> 00:51:12,809
[SPEAKER_44]: So residents know that they have a place and a person to talk to if need be.

580
00:51:13,709 --> 00:51:13,930
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

581

584
00:51:20,999 --> 00:51:32,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, and I think Mr. Benedetto spoke earlier on the concerns about keeping the sidewalks and equipment clear from the work area.

585
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:35,603
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you could make sure that gets done too, it would be appreciated.

00:57:49,642 --> 00:57:52,305
[SPEAKER_37]: Do we have Verizon with us tonight?

655
00:57:54,363 --> 00:58:03,148
[SPEAKER_57]: Mr. President, I notified National Grid, Vincent LoGiudice, he accepted the meeting and is aware.

656
00:58:03,288 --> 00:58:06,189
[SPEAKER_57]: There's another National Grid grant location on tonight as well.

657
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:14,114
[SPEAKER_57]: So I'm not sure if somebody who is in the queue is representing National Grid or Verizon tonight.

658
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:22,218
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, is there anyone here on the meeting that is representing National Grid or Verizon?

659
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:31,369
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. President, I do think it's important to point out that this measure has been recommended by the city engineer.

660
00:58:31,689 --> 00:58:40,071
[SPEAKER_43]: And as part of the Eversource project, I do believe that that area will be resurfaced curb to curb on the completion of the Eversource project.

661
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:41,591
[SPEAKER_43]: So I think that's something that's important to point out.

662
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:48,513
[SPEAKER_43]: If in fact there is any disruption or trenching that's done in that area, come completion of the Eversource project, it will be resurfaced curb to curb.

663
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:52,454
[SPEAKER_43]: I can certainly confidently vote for this paper this evening in approval.

664
00:58:53,298 --> 00:59:02,140
[SPEAKER_43]: However, I would defer to the rest of the council as to what direction they want to take, whether they want to receive them at a table of matter or a table of matter until the applicant comes back is fine with me.

665
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,441
[SPEAKER_43]: That's been a normal practice in the past, but I'm comfortable voting on it this evening.

666
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:06,501
[SPEAKER_43]: I wish you good luck.

667
00:59:07,821 --> 00:59:08,621
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

668
00:59:09,862 --> 00:59:13,082
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other councilors who want to comment on this or make a motion?

669
00:59:14,223 --> 00:59:14,883
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President?

670
00:59:15,383 --> 00:59:15,963
[SPEAKER_44]: Councilor Marks?

671
00:59:17,072 --> 00:59:28,124
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President, as many residents are aware, we're undergoing a major infrastructure project going on right now with Eversource that's coming down Winthrop Street.

672
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:36,092
[SPEAKER_44]: And there's going to be much disruption to the area, as well as South Street and Mystic Ave.

673
00:59:36,853 --> 00:59:38,795
[SPEAKER_44]: And I did have a couple of questions.

674
00:59:45,401 --> 00:59:49,704
[SPEAKER_44]: using the existing trenches that will be dug by Eversource?

675
00:59:50,225 --> 00:59:52,246
[SPEAKER_44]: Or will they be creating their own trenches?

676
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:56,990
[SPEAKER_44]: They also mentioned underground laterals and cables and wires.

677
00:59:57,591 --> 01:00:05,397
[SPEAKER_44]: Is that going to be part of the extensive digging and trenching that Eversource is going to do for their electrical transmission?

678
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:08,619
[SPEAKER_44]: So I have a number of questions, Mr. President.

679
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:14,384
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm not sure if, you know, we don't meet until the end of August.

680
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:18,090
[SPEAKER_44]: So I'm not sure if time is of the essence.

681
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:21,691
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't know if we have our city engineer on tonight as well.

682
01:00:21,711 --> 01:00:24,092
[SPEAKER_44]: I thought I may have seen his name.

683
01:00:25,233 --> 01:00:26,633
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. Clark, do you know if he's on?

684
01:00:27,694 --> 01:00:30,375
[SPEAKER_57]: I do not see him, Councilor, but I'm scrolling through now.

685
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:39,398
[SPEAKER_37]: We can, I mean, we can maybe, if you want, and I showed the representative from

686
01:00:40,472 --> 01:00:43,675
[SPEAKER_37]: Verizon or National Grid is maybe having problems logging in.

687
01:00:43,695 --> 01:00:46,598
[SPEAKER_37]: We can maybe table to the end of the meeting.

688
01:00:46,618 --> 01:00:48,139
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know if the clerk can reach out to him.

689
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,501
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm going to reach out right now.

690
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:51,403
[SPEAKER_41]: OK.

691
01:00:51,423 --> 01:00:52,504
[SPEAKER_41]: Motion to table, Mr. President.

692
01:00:53,204 --> 01:00:54,846
[SPEAKER_41]: Actually, motion to continue the public hearing.

693
01:00:55,627 --> 01:00:56,167
[SPEAKER_41]: So August 25.

694
01:00:58,601 --> 01:01:00,602
[SPEAKER_37]: What if they show up in like 10 minutes?

695
01:01:01,163 --> 01:01:03,124
[SPEAKER_44]: Why don't we just move it to the end of the meeting?

696
01:01:03,864 --> 01:01:08,027
[SPEAKER_44]: And then if they don't show up, Mr. President, I would agree with Councilor Knight.

697
01:01:08,907 --> 01:01:13,390
[SPEAKER_44]: Because there's already a major project going on there, and I'm not sure the extent of this project.

698
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,191
[SPEAKER_44]: We don't know the hours of operation.

699
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:19,874
[SPEAKER_44]: We don't know if they're going to be working in conjunction with National Grid and Eversource.

700
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:22,175
[SPEAKER_44]: I really don't know anything about the project.

701
01:01:24,861 --> 01:01:29,124
[SPEAKER_44]: So that's what I would ask, that we move this to the end of the agenda calendar.

702
01:01:29,705 --> 01:01:39,192
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so why don't we table this for now and hopefully someone from Verizon or National Group will log in and we can take it up towards the end of the meeting.

703
01:01:40,172 --> 01:01:42,634
[SPEAKER_37]: So Council Member Marks, was that a motion to table?

704
01:01:43,335 --> 01:01:47,398
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion to table, and then we can see if the city clerk can get a hold of someone.

705
01:01:47,898 --> 01:01:48,098
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

706
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:49,680

[SPEAKER_37]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

808
01:07:42,801 --> 01:07:45,562
[SPEAKER_37]: 20-484 offered by council all night.

809
01:07:45,622 --> 01:07:58,589
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a committee of the whole to discuss the future of the Memphis Fire Headquarters with the representatives from the Mayor's Task Force, Local 1032, and the Director, Finance Director, and Fire Chief.

810
01:07:59,170 --> 01:07:59,650
[SPEAKER_37]: Council all night.

811
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:04,253
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. President, I find this is a rather self-explanatory resolution.

812
01:08:04,853 --> 01:08:16,181
[SPEAKER_43]: What I'm asking for is a committee of the whole meeting with the administration and representatives of the fire department and the fire union to discuss the future of our fire headquarters, fire training tower, and the like, Mr. President.

813
01:08:16,441 --> 01:08:22,625
[SPEAKER_43]: We've had many discussions over the past three or four years relative to these projects, and many commitments were made.

814
01:08:23,085 --> 01:08:26,388
[SPEAKER_43]: And I just would like to see where we stand in this process.

815
01:08:26,948 --> 01:08:29,670
[SPEAKER_43]: I know we face very trying and scary financial

816
01:08:30,475 --> 01:08:32,356
[SPEAKER_43]: times right now, the picture isn't beautiful.

817
01:08:33,116 --> 01:08:44,062
[SPEAKER_43]: However, I think it's important that we maintain some of the commitments that we made, and at the very least communicate with friends of the fire department as to where we stand, what's going on, and what commitments still remain on the table moving forward.

818
01:08:44,603 --> 01:08:47,264
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

819
01:08:47,784 --> 01:08:56,089
[SPEAKER_43]: This is really just an effort to get more information, to find out where we are from a capital planning standpoint related to fire safety services, Mr. President.

820
01:08:59,815 --> 01:09:03,138
[SPEAKER_37]: Did any councilors have any comments or questions regarding the resolution?

821
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,540
[SPEAKER_37]: Does the resolution have a second?

822
01:09:09,242 --> 01:09:10,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded, Mr. President.

823
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:13,465
[SPEAKER_36]: I believe we have a second.

824
01:09:13,505 --> 01:09:14,645
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Scott Kelly, okay.

825
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,948
[SPEAKER_37]: Are there any questions or comments from the public regarding the resolution?

826
01:09:18,968 --> 01:09:23,992
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

827
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:30,957
[SPEAKER_37]: Hearing and seeing none, on the, let's see, on the motion of Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

840
01:09:45,605 --> 01:09:45,825
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

841
01:09:46,446 --> 01:09:47,186
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco?

842
01:09:47,786 --> 01:09:47,986
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

843
01:09:48,027 --> 01:09:50,408
[SPEAKER_37]: Sending the affirmative, zero to the negative, the motion passes.

844
01:09:51,658 --> 01:10:18,960
[SPEAKER_37]: 20-485 be it resolved, I'm sorry, 20-485 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the City Clerk be directed per Section 2-592 of the Ordinances of the City of Meffitt to provide the Meffitt City Council with copies of any application filed with Article IV Site Plan Review Sections 94-331 through 94-336 of the Ordinances of the City of Meffitt within seven days of receipt thereof.

845
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,521
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Knight?

846
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:28,218
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, Mr. President, this is just a resolution providing a directive to the city clerk to forward us certain informations that come to his office.

847
01:10:28,699 --> 01:10:37,143
[SPEAKER_43]: All too often, as a city councilor, you know, when you're down at CB Scoops getting an ice cream, someone will come up to you and say, hey, what's going on at this address or this location?

848
01:10:37,183 --> 01:10:38,224
[SPEAKER_43]: You say, what are you talking about?

849
01:10:38,244 --> 01:10:38,884
[SPEAKER_43]: I have no idea.

850
01:10:38,964 --> 01:10:40,665
[SPEAKER_43]: And they say, well, there's doing construction over there.

851
01:10:40,705 --> 01:10:41,386
[SPEAKER_43]: What's the story?

852
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:44,307
[SPEAKER_43]: Well, I've never received a paper on that.

853
01:10:45,448 --> 01:10:50,330
[SPEAKER_43]: Pursuant to the way that projects are filed through site plan review, they have to be submitted to the clerk's office, Mr. President.

854
01:10:50,350 --> 01:11:01,975
[SPEAKER_43]: So what this is is just directing the city clerk when any item that's subject to site plan review comes across his desk to include it in our council packets so that we're aware of it and then we can do our due diligence to be well informed about the certain projects that are going on.

855
01:11:03,116 --> 01:11:05,577
[SPEAKER_43]: So what this is is asking the city clerk to provide us with information

856
01:11:06,176 --> 01:11:12,621
[SPEAKER_43]: The city clerk was never directed to do this in the past, so what we're doing is just taking a step to ensure that we receive this information.

857
01:11:12,641 --> 01:11:14,022
[SPEAKER_43]: I think Adam's doing a great job.

858
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:16,224
[SPEAKER_43]: This is no reflection on the work that he's doing.

859
01:11:16,724 --> 01:11:20,967
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a new responsibility that we're tasking upon him, like we do probably every other week.

860
01:11:20,987 --> 01:11:22,208
[SPEAKER_43]: We give him something else to do.

861
01:11:22,848 --> 01:11:27,592
[SPEAKER_43]: I think pretty soon we'll have to look at giving this guy a raise or some more vacation time, Mr. President, if he's able to take it.

862
01:11:28,753 --> 01:11:38,141
[SPEAKER_43]: being said, this is just an opportunity for us to gain information and gain certain documents related to projects that are being performed in our community that are subject to the site plan review.

863
01:11:38,582 --> 01:11:43,786
[SPEAKER_43]: Those are the same projects that are also subject to our inclusionary housing ordinance.

864
01:11:43,806 --> 01:11:47,009
[SPEAKER_43]: So I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we're aware of that before the shovel goes in the ground.

865
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:49,171
[SPEAKER_37]: Well said.

866
01:11:50,092 --> 01:11:50,913
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you Councilor Knight.

867
01:11:52,114 --> 01:11:54,236
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by

868
01:11:55,922 --> 01:11:56,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Second, Mr. President.

869
01:11:56,982 --> 01:11:58,283
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by Vice President Caviello.

870
01:11:58,303 --> 01:12:00,104
[SPEAKER_37]: Are there any questions or comments from the council?

871
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:03,866
[SPEAKER_37]: Any from the public?

872
01:12:08,548 --> 01:12:11,589
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, hearing and seeing none, on the motion of councilor.

873
01:12:11,769 --> 01:12:13,850
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm sorry?

874
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:16,191
[SPEAKER_31]: Sorry, President Falco, I see Laurel has her hand up.

875
01:12:16,551 --> 01:12:17,351
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

876
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:17,752
[SPEAKER_31]: Let's see.

877
01:12:18,472 --> 01:12:19,212
[SPEAKER_37]: Laurel, there you are.

878
01:12:19,412 --> 01:12:19,973
[SPEAKER_37]: Apologize.

879
01:12:21,273 --> 01:12:22,354
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm gonna try to unmute you.

880
01:12:23,774 --> 01:12:24,074
[SPEAKER_37]: There you go.

881
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:25,315
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

882
01:12:25,962 --> 01:12:28,723
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you, Laurel Ruma, 149 Burgett Avenue, Medford.

883
01:12:29,564 --> 01:12:35,747
[SPEAKER_60]: So I just want to be clear that site plans do not, Tufts University is not required to file site plans with the city.

884
01:12:35,787 --> 01:12:43,831
[SPEAKER_60]: However, I would like this amendment to specifically say that any plan that Tufts University files also should be brought before the city council.

885
01:12:45,091 --> 01:12:46,412
[SPEAKER_60]: Okay, thank you.

886
01:12:47,372 --> 01:12:48,573
[SPEAKER_41]: For clarification, Mr. President,

887
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,302
[SPEAKER_43]: Resolution does nothing to change the existing ordinances.

888
01:12:52,362 --> 01:12:54,164
[SPEAKER_43]: It does nothing to change the approval process.

889
01:12:54,224 --> 01:12:56,746
[SPEAKER_43]: All it does is allow us to be informed with documentation.

890
01:12:57,687 --> 01:13:08,877
[SPEAKER_43]: It's really a request for public records that's an ongoing request for public records that when they come into the clerk's office, we get a copy of it, but it's not doing anything to change the existing ordinance or the existing approval process.

891
01:13:09,857 --> 01:13:16,283
[SPEAKER_43]: That's not the intent of this piece of legislation, and it's not something I'm willing to amend to reach that fire at this point in time.

892
01:13:17,145 --> 01:13:18,445
[SPEAKER_60]: Absolutely understood.

893
01:13:18,505 --> 01:13:24,207
[SPEAKER_60]: Councilor, it's just the point that when people ask what's happening at that address or this address, people also ask what's happening at Tufts University.

894
01:13:24,607 --> 01:13:26,148
[SPEAKER_60]: They also have addresses within the city.

895
01:13:26,408 --> 01:13:31,450
[SPEAKER_60]: Therefore, if a plan comes before the city clerk, it should also come before the city council.

896
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:34,271
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

897
01:13:38,032 --> 01:13:38,952
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's see.

898
01:13:40,913 --> 01:13:42,193
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to try to unmute you again.

899
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:44,154
[SPEAKER_38]: There you go.

900
01:13:44,234 --> 01:13:45,054
[SPEAKER_38]: Name, address, and record.

901
01:13:45,779 --> 01:13:47,400
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, President Flanagan.

902
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,660
[SPEAKER_28]: Erin DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn Street.

903
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:54,382
[SPEAKER_28]: I agree wholeheartedly with the addition of Tufts filing that.

904
01:13:55,082 --> 01:13:59,724
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't know in our neighborhood what is happening and what construction is happening.

905
01:14:00,024 --> 01:14:05,626
[SPEAKER_28]: And if the city council is where I go to when I ask those questions.

906
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:09,267
[SPEAKER_28]: So it would be really nice if you had that information as well.

907
01:14:09,567 --> 01:14:15,369
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm hoping that the council or one of the councilors will amend the amendment to include Tufts University.

908
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:17,382
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

909
01:14:20,563 --> 01:14:23,604
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments from the public?

910
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:31,866
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, hearing and seeing none.

911
01:14:32,366 --> 01:14:33,007
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. President.

912
01:14:33,407 --> 01:14:34,027
[SPEAKER_44]: Council Marks.

913
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:43,190
[SPEAKER_44]: I would ask that if the council is all right with that, that we amended to allow for any correspondence from Tufts University to be passed off to us as well.

914
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:44,370
[SPEAKER_41]: Motion to so.

915
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,283
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm so glad that I missed you.

916
01:14:49,303 --> 01:14:50,143
[SPEAKER_37]: Can you say again?

917
01:14:50,263 --> 01:14:51,324
[SPEAKER_43]: I'd offer a motion to sever.

918
01:14:51,844 --> 01:14:52,244
[SPEAKER_37]: To sever?

919
01:14:52,304 --> 01:14:52,584
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

920
01:14:52,944 --> 01:14:54,345
[SPEAKER_37]: So you want that to be a B paper then?

921
01:14:56,766 --> 01:14:58,687
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't want it to be any paper, but the council is adding it.

922
01:14:58,707 --> 01:14:59,907
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'm asking that it be severed.

923
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:02,588
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilman Marks, should that be a B paper?

924
01:15:02,608 --> 01:15:04,369
[SPEAKER_37]: A B paper is fine, Mr. President.

925
01:15:04,949 --> 01:15:05,369
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

926
01:15:05,409 --> 01:15:07,090
[SPEAKER_37]: So thank you, Councilman Marks.

927
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:09,551
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Urtubis, do you have the wording on the B paper?

928
01:15:13,069 --> 01:15:22,773
[SPEAKER_57]: Council Marks' B paper is to allow any correspondence from Tufts to be included as well in these types of communications.

929
01:15:24,533 --> 01:15:26,734
[SPEAKER_37]: That's accurate?

930
01:15:27,215 --> 01:15:27,815
[SPEAKER_37]: That's accurate.

931
01:15:28,295 --> 01:15:28,635
[SPEAKER_37]: OK.

932
01:15:29,415 --> 01:15:31,736
[SPEAKER_37]: So what we will do is we will vote on the B paper first.

933
01:15:32,216 --> 01:15:34,077
[SPEAKER_37]: That B paper was offered by Council Marks.

934
01:15:34,137 --> 01:15:35,398
[SPEAKER_37]: Does that B paper have a second?

935
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:38,199
[SPEAKER_29]: Second, Mr. President.

936
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:40,360
[SPEAKER_37]: That B paper is seconded by Councilor Beers.

937
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,034
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll.

938
01:15:45,935 --> 01:15:46,515
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs?

939
01:15:47,455 --> 01:15:47,735
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

940
01:15:48,876 --> 01:15:49,816
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Caravaglia?

941
01:15:50,136 --> 01:15:50,376
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

942
01:15:50,976 --> 01:15:51,496
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

943
01:15:51,856 --> 01:15:52,096
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes.

944
01:15:52,617 --> 01:15:53,157
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks?

945
01:15:53,597 --> 01:15:53,877
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

946
01:15:54,397 --> 01:15:54,997
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell?

947
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:55,797
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

948
01:15:56,657 --> 01:15:57,438
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

949
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:59,198
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

950
01:15:59,818 --> 01:16:00,558
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco?

951
01:16:00,978 --> 01:16:01,199
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

952
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:03,899
[SPEAKER_37]: Sending the affirmative, zeroing the negative, the motion passes.

953
01:16:04,779 --> 01:16:09,400
[SPEAKER_37]: On the main paper, the main resolution offered by Council, and it's seconded by Vice President Caravaglia.

954
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:10,481
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll.

955
01:16:10,501 --> 01:16:11,461
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm going to second.

956
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:20,660
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs.

957
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:21,880
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

958
01:16:22,461 --> 01:16:23,401
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Carabiello.

959
01:16:23,741 --> 01:16:24,021
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

960
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:25,021
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight.

961
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:25,641
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

962
01:16:26,061 --> 01:16:26,601
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks.

963
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:27,402
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

964
01:16:27,942 --> 01:16:28,542
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell.

965
01:16:29,102 --> 01:16:29,362
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

966
01:16:29,842 --> 01:16:30,622
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli.

967
01:16:31,562 --> 01:16:31,782
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

968
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:33,003
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco.

969
01:16:33,383 --> 01:16:33,603
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

970
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:35,503
[SPEAKER_37]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

971
01:16:35,603 --> 01:16:36,483
[SPEAKER_37]: The motion passes.

972
01:16:36,503 --> 01:16:41,685
[SPEAKER_37]: 2-0-486 offered by Councilor Knight.

973
01:16:42,105 --> 01:16:47,846
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council receive a report from the Chief of Police regarding the events of July 4th.

974
01:16:48,006 --> 01:16:48,486
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Knight.

975
01:16:49,436 --> 01:16:51,217
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, Mr. President, it's been brought to my attention.

976
01:16:51,237 --> 01:16:52,597
[SPEAKER_43]: I think it's been brought to all of our attention.

977
01:16:53,037 --> 01:17:13,163
[SPEAKER_43]: All of us in the community are well aware that a series of unfortunate events occurred on the night of July 4th down along Willis and Conger Street, I do believe, Mr. President, where there was an assault on police officers, shooting of fireworks, throwing of M-80s, quarter sticks of dynamite at our police officers under their cars.

978
01:17:14,223 --> 01:17:15,944
[SPEAKER_43]: Just a scene of unrest.

979
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:22,400
[SPEAKER_43]: in violence, Mr. President, against our police department, against members of our public safety community.

980
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:24,781
[SPEAKER_43]: Our fire department, our police department, we're on the scene.

981
01:17:25,702 --> 01:17:32,565
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'd just like to get a report, Mr. President, because unlike some people in this community that feel as though Facebook is the gospel of news, I don't.

982
01:17:33,285 --> 01:17:38,828
[SPEAKER_43]: I feel as though if we're going to find out what's going on in this community, we should get official reports from the people in the department heads that are responsible for that.

983
01:17:39,392 --> 01:17:44,973
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, I'm bringing this initiative forward so I can have a better understanding of what happened down there, Mr. President, because I really don't know.

984
01:17:45,393 --> 01:17:50,874
[SPEAKER_43]: The information that I've received about this has all been from media outlets and fake news outlets.

985
01:17:50,914 --> 01:17:54,035
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, I'm hoping that we can get a report directly from our chief of police.

986
01:17:55,355 --> 01:17:56,235
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

987
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:58,175
[SPEAKER_29]: Second, Mr. President.

988
01:17:59,235 --> 01:18:02,616
[SPEAKER_37]: So that motion is offered by Councilor Knight and seconded by Councilor Beers.

989
01:18:02,676 --> 01:18:04,856
[SPEAKER_37]: Are there any questions from the council regarding the motion?

990
01:18:08,766 --> 01:18:10,567
[SPEAKER_37]: Any questions or comments from the public?

991
01:18:19,952 --> 01:18:22,694
[SPEAKER_37]: Diane, if we could please have your name and address for the record, please.

992
01:18:23,354 --> 01:18:26,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Diane Sullivan, Jerome Street, Medford.

993
01:18:27,517 --> 01:18:29,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

994
01:18:29,558 --> 01:18:37,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious, will we have the same type of report on the events of July 15th at City Hall?

995
01:18:40,606 --> 01:18:46,470
[SPEAKER_41]: If a council has the option to offer that resolution, it will be brought up for a vote.

996
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:52,134
[SPEAKER_43]: But as of right now, the issue that's before this council is the issues and events that happened on the evening of July 4th.

997
01:18:52,174 --> 01:18:54,015
[SPEAKER_43]: And I would move for approval on that paper, Mr. President.

998
01:18:54,035 --> 01:18:56,557
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay.

999
01:18:57,138 --> 01:18:57,998
[SPEAKER_49]: Second, Mr. President.

1000
01:18:58,859 --> 01:18:59,179
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay.

1001
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:03,302
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments?

1002
01:19:06,424 --> 01:19:07,485
[SPEAKER_38]: One minute.

1003
01:19:11,994 --> 01:19:12,874
[SPEAKER_38]: Matt, did you have any hand up?

1004
01:19:12,954 --> 01:19:13,715
[SPEAKER_38]: I just want to make sure.

1005
01:19:14,795 --> 01:19:14,935
[SPEAKER_32]: No.

1006
01:19:17,376 --> 01:19:17,636
[SPEAKER_32]: OK.

1007
01:19:19,177 --> 01:19:19,517
[SPEAKER_38]: OK.

1008
01:19:20,918 --> 01:19:22,138
[SPEAKER_31]: On the motion of council night.

1009
01:19:23,999 --> 01:19:24,619
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President.

1010
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:25,319
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes.

1011
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,980
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a new hand up.

1012
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:27,900
[SPEAKER_31]: Joanna.

1013
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,561
[SPEAKER_54]: Let me, one minute.

1014
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:41,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Joanna, name and address for the record, please.

1015
01:19:42,492 --> 01:19:43,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Joanna quit hearing me.

1016
01:19:43,553 --> 01:19:45,414
[SPEAKER_06]: He had 35 early out of Medford.

1017
01:19:46,995 --> 01:19:47,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1018
01:19:48,035 --> 01:19:53,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say that I too would like to see the report from the chief of police for July 4th incident.

1019
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:54,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1020
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:55,059
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

1021
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:55,419
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1022
01:19:55,439 --> 01:20:00,662
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

1023
01:20:01,142 --> 01:20:01,442
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see.

1024
01:20:01,883 --> 01:20:03,784
[SPEAKER_37]: Uh, any other questions or comments?

1025
01:20:03,804 --> 01:20:07,026
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

1026
01:20:07,046 --> 01:20:11,208
[SPEAKER_36]: Seeing and hearing none on the motion of council and I seconded by

1027
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:15,932
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor, I believe it was Councilor Beers.

1028
01:20:15,952 --> 01:20:16,513
[SPEAKER_57]: Please call the roll.

1029
01:20:17,514 --> 01:20:18,074
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Beers?

1030
01:20:18,895 --> 01:20:19,175
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1031
01:20:20,376 --> 01:20:21,217
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Carabiello?

1032
01:20:21,658 --> 01:20:21,938
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1033
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:22,959
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

1034
01:20:23,379 --> 01:20:23,620
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1035
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:24,781
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks?

1036
01:20:25,281 --> 01:20:25,661
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1037
01:20:26,102 --> 01:20:26,702
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell?

1038
01:20:27,363 --> 01:20:27,623
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1039
01:20:28,064 --> 01:20:28,844
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1040
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:29,825
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1041
01:20:30,366 --> 01:20:31,047
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco?

1042
01:20:32,548 --> 01:20:35,250
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1043
01:20:36,215 --> 01:20:40,260
[SPEAKER_37]: 20-488 offered by Councilor Knight being resolved at the Memphis City Council.

1044
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:45,285
[SPEAKER_37]: Extend its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Elaine Honeycutt on her recent passing.

1045
01:20:46,066 --> 01:20:46,587
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Knight.

1046
01:20:47,504 --> 01:20:49,066
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1047
01:20:49,086 --> 01:20:54,751
[SPEAKER_43]: For those of us that have been around the community, we're all well aware of the Honeycutt family and the contributions that they've made to MedFed.

1048
01:20:55,631 --> 01:21:03,739
[SPEAKER_43]: We look at Bill Honeycutt and the work that he does with John Brewer's Tavern and the volunteerism and the donations that he makes to the community.

1049
01:21:04,139 --> 01:21:08,062
[SPEAKER_43]: We look at Steve Honeycutt and the work that he did on the Disability Commission before his passing.

1050
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:09,364
[SPEAKER_43]: And here we have

1051
01:21:10,856 --> 01:21:18,379
[SPEAKER_43]: Mrs. Honeycutt, who recently passed away, who's done such a great job raising children that had such a focus on community and such a focus on giving back.

1052
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:20,400
[SPEAKER_43]: It's just very sad to see her leave.

1053
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:21,860
[SPEAKER_43]: She was an integral part of this community.

1054
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:30,803
[SPEAKER_43]: She did great work raising her children, and she's raised them to be great participants in social capital and the social fabric I mentioned, Mr. President, and she will surely be missed.

1055
01:21:30,883 --> 01:21:38,506
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in expressing deepest condolences and sincere condolences to the Honeycutt family in their time of loss.

1056
01:21:40,603 --> 01:21:41,443
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1057
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:43,804
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Carviello.

1058
01:21:43,824 --> 01:21:44,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1059
01:21:44,805 --> 01:21:47,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I want to echo Councilor Knight's comments.

1060
01:21:47,766 --> 01:22:02,514
[SPEAKER_16]: The Honeycutt's contribution to the city of Medford go so far from donations they made to the contributions to the disabilities of members of the community.

1061
01:22:02,534 --> 01:22:09,138
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I thank them for all their work and send my condolences to their family also.

1062
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:12,296
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1063
01:22:12,436 --> 01:22:13,077
[SPEAKER_44]: Councilor Marks.

1064
01:22:14,038 --> 01:22:14,979
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1065
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:17,542
[SPEAKER_44]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on the agenda.

1066
01:22:18,003 --> 01:22:20,305
[SPEAKER_44]: You couldn't meet a kinder, gentler woman.

1067
01:22:21,206 --> 01:22:27,754
[SPEAKER_44]: She was truly what represented this community in everything she did, Mr. President.

1068
01:22:28,414 --> 01:22:30,857
[SPEAKER_44]: And she was a loving wife.

1069
01:22:31,758 --> 01:22:46,362
[SPEAKER_44]: mother, grandmother, sister, and just a truly great woman, as was mentioned by my colleagues, that raised a tremendous family that still continues to give back to this community, and she will be sorely missed.

1070
01:22:47,203 --> 01:22:53,104
[SPEAKER_44]: If I could, Mr. President, I'd like to have this meeting named in her honor, Mr. President.

1071
01:22:53,244 --> 01:22:53,604
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1072
01:22:54,004 --> 01:22:54,705
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Council.

1073
01:22:54,725 --> 01:22:55,585
[SPEAKER_40]: Look at the motion, Mr. President.

1074
01:22:57,526 --> 01:22:59,106
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Knight, I'm sorry, I missed that.

1075
01:23:00,447 --> 01:23:01,168
[SPEAKER_41]: I second the motion.

1076
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:01,950
[SPEAKER_37]: OK.

1077
01:23:04,213 --> 01:23:04,594
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1078
01:23:05,235 --> 01:23:05,936
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other comments?

1079
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:14,490
[SPEAKER_37]: So as we offer our deepest and sincere condolences to the Honeycup family, I'd ask everyone at this time to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

1080
01:23:33,473 --> 01:23:33,793
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1081
01:23:39,658 --> 01:23:49,146
[SPEAKER_37]: And on the motion of Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Knight, that this meeting tonight be dedicated to the family of Elaine Honeycutt on her recent passing.

1082
01:23:49,706 --> 01:23:50,827
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk, please call the roll.

1083
01:23:55,431 --> 01:23:56,051
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs?

1084
01:23:56,912 --> 01:23:57,152
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1085
01:23:57,873 --> 01:23:58,733
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Caravaglio?

1086
01:23:58,994 --> 01:23:59,174
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1087
01:24:00,026 --> 01:24:00,526
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

1088
01:24:00,967 --> 01:24:01,247
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1089
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:02,208
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks?

1090
01:24:02,988 --> 01:24:03,328
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1091
01:24:03,749 --> 01:24:04,369
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell?

1092
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:05,270
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1093
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:06,431
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1094
01:24:07,972 --> 01:24:08,252
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1095
01:24:08,733 --> 01:24:09,453
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Falco?

1096
01:24:09,994 --> 01:24:10,214
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1097
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:12,515
[SPEAKER_37]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1098
01:24:12,535 --> 01:24:26,846
[SPEAKER_37]: 20-489 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the city administration meet with the Hormel Commission in the leadership of Allentown Catholic High School to establish a plan to allow graduation ceremonies at Hormel Stadium.

1099
01:24:27,287 --> 01:24:27,807
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Knight.

1100
01:24:28,967 --> 01:24:34,731
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. President, it's my understanding that this issue has been resolved, that Arlington Catholic has decided to take their business elsewhere.

1101
01:24:35,891 --> 01:24:43,876
[SPEAKER_43]: However, I do find it quite unfortunate the series of events and circumstances that led up to Arlington Catholic having to go somewhere else to hold their graduation.

1102
01:24:45,197 --> 01:24:54,923
[SPEAKER_43]: The O'Melle Commission granted a permit, Arlington Catholic wrote a check, and they were unable to hold their graduation due to concerns around COVID-19.

1103
01:24:56,078 --> 01:25:03,982
[SPEAKER_43]: However, at the same time, Medford High School, who has a class that's twice the size, is holding graduation ceremonies at Homel Stadium.

1104
01:25:04,642 --> 01:25:10,585
[SPEAKER_43]: So for the interest of just fairness, Mr. President, I don't understand why this happened or how this happened.

1105
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:20,169
[SPEAKER_43]: I just find it unfortunate that the number of children that graduated from Island and Catholic that have Medford roots or are Medford residents are probably up to 30% or 40% of the senior class.

1106
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:24,311
[SPEAKER_43]: And to have them want to hold their ceremonies here in Medford

1107
01:25:24,932 --> 01:25:40,078
[SPEAKER_43]: This shows what a great relationship we have with Huntington Catholic and the amount of people in this community that believe in faith-based education and that send their children to Huntington Catholic but also remain members of our community that contribute quite a bit.

1108
01:25:41,078 --> 01:25:42,599
[SPEAKER_43]: So I just found that unfortunate, Mr. President.

1109
01:25:42,619 --> 01:25:43,219
[SPEAKER_43]: It's about the kids.

1110
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:59,849
[SPEAKER_43]: And I'd like to get a report back from the city, but after filing this resolution and after the agenda was published, I did receive a lengthy response from the chief of staff that I admittedly glanced over and haven't had the opportunity to really get into and to read, Mr. President.

1111
01:25:59,869 --> 01:26:10,835
[SPEAKER_43]: So I will be offering to receive and place this paper on file until I can perform my due diligence and read the report that Chief of Staff Rodriguez forwarded to my email account and all of ours earlier in the week.

1112
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:16,626
[SPEAKER_43]: But with that being said, I do find it unfortunate that, you know, things had to turn out this way.

1113
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:21,435
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think that, you know, as the months and days go by,

1114
01:26:23,223 --> 01:26:34,028
[SPEAKER_43]: we need to come to grips with what's going on in the world, but also what's going on in this community and how we can continue to better provide services under whatever they want to call this new normal or whatever it is.

1115
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:35,949
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't think there's anything normal about it, Mr. President.

1116
01:26:35,969 --> 01:26:36,750
[SPEAKER_43]: I think it's craziness.

1117
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:40,912
[SPEAKER_43]: You can go into Target, but you can't go into City Hall.

1118
01:26:41,492 --> 01:26:44,474
[SPEAKER_43]: You got to wait in line to go in City Hall, but you can't go into Target.

1119
01:26:44,614 --> 01:26:45,614
[SPEAKER_43]: It's getting nutty.

1120
01:26:46,715 --> 01:26:51,317
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that it's time that we figure out what course we're going to take, what direction we're going to go in.

1121
01:26:51,633 --> 01:26:53,314
[SPEAKER_43]: get a game plan together and let's stick to it.

1122
01:26:53,835 --> 01:27:08,226
[SPEAKER_43]: I know that there's a lot of uncertainty, there's a lot of dynamic pieces and moving pieces and moving parts, Mr. President, but for us to not be able to provide for those families and those kids a graduation ceremony after all that they've had to put up with since St.

1123
01:27:08,246 --> 01:27:12,370
[SPEAKER_43]: Patrick's Day is a little bit unfortunate and I would have liked to see it handled a little bit differently.

1124
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:16,433
[SPEAKER_43]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I will take the time

1125
01:27:22,879 --> 01:27:26,980
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I will offer to receive and place this item on file.

1126
01:27:27,521 --> 01:27:31,142
[SPEAKER_43]: However, there was a lot of concern about it that was brought up over the last several weeks.

1127
01:27:31,402 --> 01:27:33,622
[SPEAKER_43]: So I felt it was warranted to place it on the agenda this evening.

1128
01:27:34,543 --> 01:27:35,443

[SPEAKER_37]: Am I correct, Clerk Artemis?

1173
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,162
[SPEAKER_57]: I believe that's accurate.

1174
01:29:07,182 --> 01:29:07,943
[SPEAKER_57]: Hang on a second.

1175
01:29:08,023 --> 01:29:10,605
[SPEAKER_57]: Let me double check the records for the agenda.

1176
01:29:14,453 --> 01:29:15,254
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, 20481.

1177
01:29:16,275 --> 01:29:19,837
[SPEAKER_57]: The number you're looking to unmute, Mr. President, is the 617279 number.

1178
01:29:20,057 --> 01:29:24,881
[SPEAKER_57]: It's under Councilor Schiappelli on my screen.

1179
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:27,943
[SPEAKER_57]: I can try to unmute him if you'd like.

1180
01:29:28,323 --> 01:29:29,004
[SPEAKER_57]: Yeah, could you please?

1181
01:29:31,846 --> 01:29:32,507
[SPEAKER_51]: Mr. Flanagan?

1182
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:33,027
[SPEAKER_51]: Good evening.

1183
01:29:33,487 --> 01:29:34,368
[SPEAKER_51]: Yes, good evening.

1188
01:30:01,914 --> 01:30:02,395
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President?

1189
01:30:02,975 --> 01:30:03,175
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes.

1190
01:30:03,735 --> 01:30:10,998
[SPEAKER_44]: I motion that we waive the remainder of the reading and have the petition to give us a brief synopsis of the work that will take place.

1191
01:30:11,618 --> 01:30:12,658
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, if you could.

1192
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:14,319
[SPEAKER_37]: Is this Mr. Flewelling?

1193
01:30:15,179 --> 01:30:15,399
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1194
01:30:15,939 --> 01:30:18,140
[SPEAKER_37]: If you could please give us a brief synopsis.

1195
01:30:19,261 --> 01:30:20,081
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, sure.

1196
01:30:20,141 --> 01:30:20,561
[SPEAKER_39]: Good evening.

1197
01:30:20,621 --> 01:30:23,562
[SPEAKER_39]: Dave Flewelling, Comcast, Woobin, Massachusetts.

1198
01:30:24,402 --> 01:30:28,984
[SPEAKER_39]: We've received a request from the Hyatt Hotel to bring a new conduit to that address.

1199
01:30:29,451 --> 01:30:39,857
[SPEAKER_39]: We'll be starting at the existing Comcast vault, excavating into place two four-inch PVC conduits, 52 feet plus or minus, to a two-foot by three-foot vault in the sidewalk.

1200
01:30:40,278 --> 01:30:48,163
[SPEAKER_39]: And then from the newly placed vault, we'll be excavating into place one four-inch PVC conduit, three feet plus or minus, onto the private property of the hotel.

1201
01:30:48,183 --> 01:30:50,264
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

1202
01:30:51,206 --> 01:30:51,626
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1203
01:30:51,646 --> 01:30:54,730
[SPEAKER_37]: So at this point, I would declare the public hearing open.

1204
01:30:55,190 --> 01:31:02,878
[SPEAKER_37]: Actually, before I move any further, I just wanted to note that this year has been approved by the chief engineer with the following conditions.

1205
01:31:03,732 --> 01:31:07,694
[SPEAKER_37]: The engineering division recommends that this grain of location be approved with the following conditions.

1206
01:31:07,734 --> 01:31:12,116
[SPEAKER_37]: Number one, the grain of location is limited to approximately 52 feet of conduit.

1207
01:31:12,596 --> 01:31:15,938
[SPEAKER_37]: Proposed vault and service conduit as described in the petition.

1208
01:31:16,418 --> 01:31:23,082
[SPEAKER_37]: Starting at the existing Comcast vault excavating to place two four-inch PVC conduits

1209
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:29,204
[SPEAKER_37]: 52 plus or minus to a proposed two-by-three vault in the sidewalk.

1210
01:31:29,764 --> 01:31:39,814
[SPEAKER_37]: From the newly placed vault excavating to a place one four-inch PVC conduit, three plus or minus and continue on to private property.

1211
01:31:40,274 --> 01:31:47,901
[SPEAKER_37]: Number two, before starting work, the contractor shall notify DIGSAFE and shall obtain all applicable permits from the engineering division.

1212
01:31:48,041 --> 01:31:49,342
[SPEAKER_37]: The project must obtain a

1213
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:58,377
[SPEAKER_37]: Street opening permit pursuant to section 74-141 of the city ordinances prior to commencing work.

1214
01:31:58,937 --> 01:32:06,819
[SPEAKER_37]: At a minimum, the street opening permit application must include a street restoration plan and traffic management plan for review and approval.

1215
01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:14,581
[SPEAKER_37]: Number three, no other utility structures, conduits, duct banks, pipes, or any other appearances are adversely impacted.

1216
01:32:14,661 --> 01:32:20,123
[SPEAKER_37]: Comcast shall ensure that all sewer, water, and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation.

1217
01:32:20,799 --> 01:32:29,506
[SPEAKER_37]: Number four, the sidewalk and street restoration shall be done in consultation with the engineering division in further requirements of an approved street opening permit.

1218
01:32:29,966 --> 01:32:37,613
[SPEAKER_37]: This must include a site inspection with the permit officer to determine the extent of pavement restoration.

1219
01:32:37,633 --> 01:32:42,957
[SPEAKER_37]: The concrete sidewalk must be replaced in kind and cleanly cut at the control joints.

1220
01:32:45,109 --> 01:32:54,131
[SPEAKER_37]: The bituminous concrete pavement over the trench shall be milled and overlaid to an offset approved by the engineering division.

1221
01:32:54,591 --> 01:32:57,692
[SPEAKER_37]: The brick-stamped concrete edging shall be replaced in kind.

1222
01:32:57,832 --> 01:33:01,373
[SPEAKER_37]: Number five, pavement markings- President, if I could stop you on that point for a moment?

1223
01:33:01,773 --> 01:33:02,033
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1224
01:33:03,013 --> 01:33:07,194
[SPEAKER_43]: Will the resurfacing be done in a curb-to-curb fashion, or is this going to be grounded inlay in a trench?

1225
01:33:11,095 --> 01:33:12,695
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Flewellen, could you comment on that, please?

1226
01:33:13,655 --> 01:33:18,977
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, we're going to go by whatever the city engineer determines on the paving restoration.

1227
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:26,139
[SPEAKER_39]: So we're going parallel across the street.

1228
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:30,440
[SPEAKER_39]: So, you know, I don't know if that really would be considered curb to curb.

1229
01:33:36,843 --> 01:33:42,805
[SPEAKER_43]: The chief of state will have a comment on that as to what the street restoration plan would be for this.

1230
01:33:42,865 --> 01:33:44,506
[SPEAKER_43]: Dave, do you have any idea around Mr. Rodriguez?

1231
01:33:44,766 --> 01:33:47,347
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm not familiar enough with the project.

1232
01:33:47,407 --> 01:33:50,608
[SPEAKER_58]: I'd have to defer to Tim McGibbon, but I'm happy to talk with him about that.

1233
01:33:50,628 --> 01:33:53,829
[SPEAKER_58]: I'll see if I can get him on the call right now.

1234
01:33:53,849 --> 01:33:54,910
[SPEAKER_58]: I'll see if I can text him and get him on.

1235
01:33:56,644 --> 01:33:57,244
[SPEAKER_43]: Excellent, thank you.

1236
01:33:57,305 --> 01:34:02,468
[SPEAKER_43]: No, it's just, it's always been a common question we've always asked about, you know, ground opening permits and restoration.

1237
01:34:03,709 --> 01:34:09,653
[SPEAKER_43]: And when, you know, our roads get reopened, what happens is we get a trench and the trench ends up being garbage in 18 months.

1238
01:34:09,933 --> 01:34:16,558
[SPEAKER_43]: And you know, the contractor is supposed to come back and let it sit for six months and replace it, then it'll be good as new, but that never happens.

1239
01:34:17,499 --> 01:34:20,321
[SPEAKER_43]: So we've been pushing for curb to curb restoration on projects like this.

1240
01:34:20,541 --> 01:34:23,163
[SPEAKER_58]: If it's a preference, it's always going to be curb to curb, of course.

1241
01:34:23,483 --> 01:34:26,325
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, Mr. Fleming, I'm just, I'm explaining to the Comcast petitioner.

1242
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:30,932
[SPEAKER_43]: and why I ask, you know, but I understand, you know, the need for the project.

1243
01:34:31,272 --> 01:34:32,853
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't like why they ask this here.

1244
01:34:32,913 --> 01:34:39,036
[SPEAKER_43]: And I apologize for interrupting, but I just figured it would be easier to ask the question while it was on the table, as opposed to going back to it after you're finished voting.

1245
01:34:39,076 --> 01:34:39,736
[SPEAKER_43]: So thank you.

1246
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:47,922
[SPEAKER_37]: Number five, pavement markings must be restored.

1247
01:34:48,022 --> 01:34:54,605
[SPEAKER_37]: Number six, the project site must be scrubbed daily and shall be kept free of debris for the duration of the installation.

1248
01:34:54,645 --> 01:34:59,388
[SPEAKER_37]: Number seven, Riverside Avenue is a highly traveled roadway for vehicles as well as pedestrians.

1249
01:34:59,928 --> 01:35:09,133
[SPEAKER_37]: A detailed TMP must be submitted to the engineering division for review and approved prior to receiving a street opening permit.

1250
01:35:09,553 --> 01:35:12,895
[SPEAKER_37]: The TMP must include accommodations for pedestrians

1251
01:35:13,328 --> 01:35:14,549
[SPEAKER_37]: in addition to vehicles.

1252
01:35:14,669 --> 01:35:18,112
[SPEAKER_37]: Number eight, the plan does not indicate drain lines or laterals.

1253
01:35:18,172 --> 01:35:20,754
[SPEAKER_37]: Drainage pipes beneath the conduit must be replaced.

1254
01:35:21,494 --> 01:35:26,798
[SPEAKER_37]: Number nine, the conduit must cross MWRA infrastructure.

1255
01:35:26,878 --> 01:35:36,165
[SPEAKER_37]: Copies of the MWRA permit must be submitted to the engineering division prior to releasing a street opening permit approved by the superintendent of wires.

1256
01:35:36,205 --> 01:35:37,967
[SPEAKER_37]: Call 781-393-2425 for any accommodations and or aids.

1257
01:35:41,747 --> 01:35:43,168
[SPEAKER_37]: Adam L. Herneby, City Clerk.

1258
01:35:43,528 --> 01:35:48,710
[SPEAKER_37]: These plans can be viewed in the City Clerk's office at 781-393-2425.

1259
01:35:49,211 --> 01:35:53,653
[SPEAKER_37]: At this point, I would declare the public hearing open, open to anyone in favor of this project.

1260
01:35:54,793 --> 01:35:58,915
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Flewelling, I would assume you're in favor?

1261
01:35:59,996 --> 01:36:00,696
[SPEAKER_39]: Correct, yes.

1262
01:36:01,237 --> 01:36:03,018
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, thank you.

1263
01:36:03,638 --> 01:36:07,860
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak that is in favor of the project?

1264
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:16,537
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

1265
01:36:21,601 --> 01:36:25,564
[SPEAKER_37]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

1266
01:36:26,945 --> 01:36:29,907
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone in opposition of the project?

1267
01:36:30,508 --> 01:36:32,089
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone in opposition that would like to speak?

1268
01:36:44,992 --> 01:36:51,955
[SPEAKER_37]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

1269
01:36:53,235 --> 01:36:53,655
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see.

1270
01:36:55,076 --> 01:36:56,376
[SPEAKER_37]: Are there any questions from the council?

1271
01:36:58,957 --> 01:36:59,398
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President?

1272
01:36:59,978 --> 01:37:00,558
[SPEAKER_44]: Councilor Marks?

1273
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:07,301
[SPEAKER_44]: Will there be any disruption to the flow of traffic in roughly how long will this project take?

1274
01:37:08,941 --> 01:37:13,643
[SPEAKER_39]: The project should take roughly under a week, say five days, weather permitting.

1275
01:37:14,733 --> 01:37:16,915
[SPEAKER_39]: There will be some disruption to traffic.

1276
01:37:16,955 --> 01:37:25,321
[SPEAKER_39]: We already have a traffic plan prepared and ready to submit with the street opening permit that does take into account the pedestrian traffic.

1277
01:37:26,862 --> 01:37:29,804
[SPEAKER_44]: And when will most of the work be done?

1278
01:37:30,464 --> 01:37:31,645
[SPEAKER_44]: During the day or at night?

1279
01:37:33,747 --> 01:37:36,689
[SPEAKER_39]: We can do it during the day or we can do it during the night.

1280
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:41,672
[SPEAKER_39]: Again, we'll abide by whatever directions are given on the street opening permit.

1281
01:37:42,324 --> 01:37:45,926
[SPEAKER_39]: If it calls for night work, we'll do the work at night.

1282
01:37:45,966 --> 01:37:47,827
[SPEAKER_39]: If it calls for day work, we'll do it during the day.

1283
01:37:49,828 --> 01:37:53,990
[SPEAKER_44]: I will leave that call, Mr. President, up to the city engineer and the city administration.

1284
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:56,031
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1285
01:37:56,071 --> 01:37:57,052
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Knight.

1286
01:37:57,552 --> 01:38:02,075
[SPEAKER_43]: I just would recommend, Mr. President, that if night work is going to be discussed, we take the appropriate steps.

1287
01:38:02,135 --> 01:38:06,237
[SPEAKER_43]: We do have two senior buildings right across the street from that location, and we don't want to disrupt.

1288
01:38:07,355 --> 01:38:12,160
[SPEAKER_43]: that elderly population that live in our senior buildings, if in fact we can avoid that.

1289
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:23,193
[SPEAKER_43]: So I certainly appreciate Councilor Mark's position on this and I too will support the paper this evening and await the report of the city engineer relative to the curb-to-curb repayment.

1290
01:38:24,395 --> 01:38:26,317
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you Councilor Marks and thank you Councilor Knight.

1291
01:38:27,149 --> 01:38:29,692
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, I do have some interest.

1292
01:38:29,712 --> 01:38:30,793
[SPEAKER_58]: I just spoke with him on the phone.

1293
01:38:31,254 --> 01:38:32,675
[SPEAKER_58]: So this is a perpendicular trench.

1294
01:38:32,735 --> 01:38:34,777
[SPEAKER_58]: It's not a parallel trench.

1295
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:37,800
[SPEAKER_58]: If it was a parallel trench, we'd certainly consider the curb-to-curb.

1296
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:42,585
[SPEAKER_58]: But with the perpendicular trench, we'll just offset to be consistent with the current pavement condition.

1297
01:38:42,605 --> 01:38:45,528
[SPEAKER_58]: So we'll try to blend it in as much as we can.

1298
01:38:46,027 --> 01:38:47,088
[SPEAKER_58]: It will be a mill and overlay.

1299
01:38:47,128 --> 01:38:50,730
[SPEAKER_58]: We won't do full depth on something like this, because it could cause more damage than it's solving.

1300
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:53,671
[SPEAKER_58]: So we can get a little bit more information for you on that.

1301
01:38:54,071 --> 01:39:00,215
[SPEAKER_58]: But just to clarify, it's a perpendicular trench on a parallel trench where a curb would be appropriate.

1302
01:39:00,255 --> 01:39:02,376
[SPEAKER_43]: It is pretty much curb to curb because it's going across the street.

1303
01:39:02,396 --> 01:39:03,176
[SPEAKER_58]: It's just going across.

1304
01:39:03,216 --> 01:39:04,557
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, it's just more narrow.

1305
01:39:04,917 --> 01:39:07,659
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. Rodriguez, that's plenty.

1306
01:39:07,699 --> 01:39:08,339
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm no engineer.

1307
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:11,421
[SPEAKER_43]: So any other information you give me that you want me to read, I'm not going to understand anyway.

1308
01:39:12,542 --> 01:39:16,744
[SPEAKER_58]: I literally had to take notes because I'm dumber than Tim is, so I had to just say what he said.

1309
01:39:17,264 --> 01:39:17,584
[SPEAKER_43]: Sounds good.

1310
01:39:17,604 --> 01:39:17,844
[SPEAKER_43]: Excellent.

1311
01:39:17,864 --> 01:39:18,345
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you very much.

1312
01:39:18,365 --> 01:39:18,905
[SPEAKER_43]: I appreciate it.

1313
01:39:19,165 --> 01:39:19,505
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1314
01:39:19,805 --> 01:39:21,166
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

1315
01:39:21,186 --> 01:39:22,067
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Council.

1316
01:39:22,447 --> 01:39:23,587
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions from the Council?

1317
01:39:26,349 --> 01:39:26,729
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

1318
01:39:27,389 --> 01:39:30,631
[SPEAKER_37]: Hearing and seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

1319
01:39:33,353 --> 01:39:34,253
[SPEAKER_42]: Move approval, Mr. President.

1320
01:39:34,653 --> 01:39:35,034

[SPEAKER_57]: Vice president Kirby yellow.

1347
01:40:17,873 --> 01:40:18,113
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1348
01:40:18,694 --> 01:40:19,174
[SPEAKER_57]: That's a night.

1349
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:19,754
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1350
01:40:20,274 --> 01:40:20,834
[SPEAKER_57]: That's a marks.

1351
01:40:21,234 --> 01:40:21,574

1352
01:40:21,975 --> 01:40:22,555
[SPEAKER_57]: That's a morale.

1353
01:40:23,135 --> 01:40:23,375
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1354
01:40:24,115 --> 01:40:24,756
[SPEAKER_57]: I'll just go Pelly.

01:40:26,756 --> 01:40:27,456
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco.

1357
01:40:27,937 --> 01:40:28,477
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1358
01:40:28,497 --> 01:40:29,857

[SPEAKER_37]: The motion passes.

1360
01:40:31,778 --> 01:40:38,700
[SPEAKER_37]: We will now revert to the regular order of business motions orders and resolutions to zero dash four nine zero offered by council marks.

1361
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:43,882
[SPEAKER_37]: He resolved that the speeding and signage on Washington street in spring street area be discussed.

1362
01:40:44,619 --> 01:40:45,239
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Marks.

1363
01:40:46,379 --> 01:40:47,620
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1364
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:54,521
[SPEAKER_44]: And I believe there may be one or two residents from the area on with us tonight that would also want to speak.

1365
01:40:54,601 --> 01:40:56,722
[SPEAKER_44]: So I just want to let that be known.

1366
01:40:57,522 --> 01:41:10,025
[SPEAKER_44]: I received a number of phone calls and emails, Mr. President, from area residents in the Washington Street, Spring Street, Bradshaw Street area regarding speeding traffic.

1367
01:41:10,665 --> 01:41:12,886
[SPEAKER_44]: This is not common to this particular area.

1368
01:41:13,686 --> 01:41:15,988
[SPEAKER_44]: We receive calls constantly throughout the community.

1369
01:41:16,848 --> 01:41:26,094
[SPEAKER_44]: And one issue that I've brought up over many years was instituting traffic calming initiatives like they do in many other communities.

1370
01:41:27,055 --> 01:41:35,300
[SPEAKER_44]: I've been on the city of Cambridge website, the city of Somerville, and we don't have to recreate the wheel, many of the initiatives

1371
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:38,241
[SPEAKER_44]: are out there and things that we can take advantage of.

1372
01:41:39,081 --> 01:41:49,465
[SPEAKER_44]: One, Mr. President, that I believe our city has fallen short on the mark is the raised crosswalks that I've mentioned for the last at least 10 years.

1373
01:41:50,366 --> 01:41:56,028
[SPEAKER_44]: Back several years ago, Mayor McGlynn offered to do a pilot program

1374
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,690
[SPEAKER_44]: with three raised crosswalks.

1375
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:06,718
[SPEAKER_44]: And to date, we have only implemented one of the three that was studied and approved.

1376
01:42:07,619 --> 01:42:09,121
[SPEAKER_44]: And that is on Winthrop Street.

1377
01:42:09,902 --> 01:42:12,865
[SPEAKER_44]: I would ask Mr. President in the interest of public safety,

1378
01:42:13,405 --> 01:42:35,601
[SPEAKER_44]: in the interest of taking our roads back from speeding traffic, that this particular area of Washington, Bradshaw, Spring Street, receive a traffic study, a formal traffic study on speeding cars, as well as the need for additional signage, Mr. President, in the area.

1379
01:42:36,461 --> 01:42:49,695
[SPEAKER_44]: And the day after, I believe it was, that I received one of the emails, I got a follow-up email from the same gentleman that said he witnessed a young boy get hit in the street by a car, Mr. President.

1380
01:42:50,015 --> 01:42:54,660
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't think it was very serious, but it was enough, Mr. President, to alarm

1381
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:58,504
[SPEAKER_44]: residents of what is taking place in their neighborhood.

1382
01:42:59,065 --> 01:43:07,336
[SPEAKER_44]: So I would ask Mr. President, in the interest of public safety, that our Traffic Commission quickly move forward on the

1383
01:43:09,585 --> 01:43:32,722
[SPEAKER_44]: creation of a traffic study in this area, the implementation of traffic calming initiatives, whether it's widening sidewalks, whether it's putting road markings, whether it's a raised crosswalk, blinking lights, whatever it might be, Mr. President, to increase safety in the area, I think would go a long way.

1384
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:39,884
[SPEAKER_44]: We've, as a council, have mentioned this ad nauseum regarding many other streets in the community.

1385
01:43:40,525 --> 01:43:52,614
[SPEAKER_44]: And I really believe, and this is no reflection on any current administration, but we really do a poor job when it comes to controlling the speed within our community.

1386
01:43:53,354 --> 01:44:02,201
[SPEAKER_44]: And when people don't feel safe taking their dog for a walk or taking their child for a walk or going for a jog, you know there's a concern in the community.

1387
01:44:02,979 --> 01:44:15,608
[SPEAKER_44]: And many of our secondary roads are becoming cut-through roads with all the Waze applications and other applications people are using, and drivers are finding any which way to get through our neighborhoods.

1388
01:44:16,428 --> 01:44:20,371
[SPEAKER_44]: And that's creating much of the chaos we're hearing about on our streets.

1389
01:44:21,051 --> 01:44:30,798
[SPEAKER_44]: So I would put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that that be sent to the Traffic Commission, and they look at additional signage on those streets.

1390
01:44:31,437 --> 01:44:37,199
[SPEAKER_44]: and the commission of a traffic study for implementation of some traffic calming initiatives.

1391
01:44:37,739 --> 01:44:46,783
[SPEAKER_44]: And I believe we have Ed Serino from the area and maybe Tony Mosca, I believe also may be on the Zoom meeting tonight.

1392
01:44:47,303 --> 01:44:50,964
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

1393
01:44:52,185 --> 01:44:56,106
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm gonna try to find them if you could, I think the clerk has a question in the meantime.

1394
01:44:56,894 --> 01:45:00,537
[SPEAKER_57]: If I could ask Councilor Marks a question, I got most of Councilor Marks' amendment.

1395
01:45:01,657 --> 01:45:07,642
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm taking the request for a traffic study as an amendment to your motion, Councilor, am I correct in doing that?

1396
01:45:08,182 --> 01:45:11,324
[SPEAKER_57]: Well, it's currently not part, yeah, so it would be an amendment to my motion.

1397
01:45:11,785 --> 01:45:23,493
[SPEAKER_57]: So from what I have been able to write down as you spoke, the amendment is for a traffic study in the area of Washington, Bradshaw, and Spring Street.

1398
01:45:25,254 --> 01:45:31,619
[SPEAKER_57]: request for a traffic study and additional signage and to ask the Traffic Commission to move forward with this study as soon as possible.

1399
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:32,540
[SPEAKER_44]: Correct.

1400
01:45:33,421 --> 01:45:37,424
[SPEAKER_44]: And any other traffic calming initiatives that the city can think of?

1401
01:45:38,385 --> 01:45:39,766
[SPEAKER_57]: Any other traffic calming initiatives?

1402
01:45:43,624 --> 01:45:44,665
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1403
01:45:46,146 --> 01:45:47,567
[SPEAKER_57]: Mr. President, can I interrupt one more time?

1404
01:45:47,867 --> 01:45:49,128
[SPEAKER_57]: It's about a previous topic.

1405
01:45:49,769 --> 01:45:54,793
[SPEAKER_57]: John Jankowski from National Grid has been trying multiple times to get on the call.

1406
01:45:54,813 --> 01:45:59,256
[SPEAKER_57]: So he is here, and he called me in my office when Councilor Marks was speaking.

1407
01:45:59,276 --> 01:46:04,060
[SPEAKER_57]: So National Grid is trying to get on this call, and I know that Mr. Jankowski was on earlier as well.

1408
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:06,382
[SPEAKER_57]: So we'll try to figure that out.

1409
01:46:06,942 --> 01:46:09,584
[SPEAKER_37]: OK, let's continue with this, and then we'll figure out.

1410
01:46:09,825 --> 01:46:11,146
[SPEAKER_57]: I apologize for the interruption.

1411
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:12,627
[SPEAKER_57]: I just didn't want to lose that piece.

1412
01:46:13,249 --> 01:46:15,050
[SPEAKER_37]: All right, we got Mr. Serino.

1413
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:16,871
[SPEAKER_37]: Could we please have your name and address for the record?

1414
01:46:17,731 --> 01:46:20,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Ed Serino, 49 Bradshaw Street, Medford.

1415
01:46:20,933 --> 01:46:22,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1416
01:46:23,434 --> 01:46:27,436
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to thank Councilor Marks for being involved in this.

1417
01:46:27,936 --> 01:46:31,718
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, if someone's still on from the mayor's office, I talked to the mayor a few times.

1418
01:46:31,958 --> 01:46:36,600
[SPEAKER_14]: You witnessed something with me last year on spring and a ribbon cutting.

1419
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:40,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, with the part of spring where I'm at, people need to speed up.

1420
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:43,280
[SPEAKER_14]: If they're coming down from Haines, they speed down.

1421
01:46:44,541 --> 01:46:45,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I grew up on Riverside Ave.

1422
01:46:45,641 --> 01:46:53,242
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke to the council many times before about my aggravation with parking and speeding in the city, especially growing up on Riverside.

1423
01:46:53,943 --> 01:46:56,543
[SPEAKER_14]: And also working for Anheuser-Busch for 35 years.

1424
01:46:56,583 --> 01:46:58,764
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been a liaison with the company and the city.

1425
01:46:59,604 --> 01:47:00,844
[SPEAKER_14]: We always try to be a great neighbor.

1426
01:47:00,884 --> 01:47:03,625
[SPEAKER_14]: And part of that is the safety of our vehicles going on the road.

1427
01:47:04,405 --> 01:47:10,526
[SPEAKER_14]: But as Councilor Mark said, my opinion is, it's not if when a tragedy is going to happen, it's when.

1428
01:47:11,229 --> 01:47:25,720
[SPEAKER_14]: My daughter is 22 years old now, so I'm not doing this for me, but I can tell you as I petitioned my neighbors for the past two weeks for signatures, I had more people from Pembroke and Carolina, which are our neighboring streets, approach me to also sign, and I told them you can't sign.

1429
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:38,089
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just trying to make Bradshaw itself six to nine during the school hours, residents only, putting the temporary speed bumps that I see on Bonner, because it's getting bad.

1430
01:47:38,169 --> 01:47:38,990
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had a couple of,

1431
01:47:39,861 --> 01:47:47,623
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't say confrontations, but I will say the young man's lucky that I'm not in my 20s and single, because it would have been a different conversation.

1432
01:47:48,203 --> 01:47:51,684
[SPEAKER_14]: When people, I'm in a new vehicle now, I almost got hit.

1433
01:47:52,384 --> 01:47:55,064
[SPEAKER_14]: People swear there's kids coming by on motorcycles.

1434
01:47:55,584 --> 01:47:59,565
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really think it's gonna be tragic when someone gets hit.

1435
01:47:59,685 --> 01:48:07,727
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say the mayor did have a Mr. Blake from the engineering department sent me a very detailed

1436
01:48:08,522 --> 01:48:11,843
[SPEAKER_14]: email a few weeks ago on the plans he has for the area.

1437
01:48:12,684 --> 01:48:22,587
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing that he wrote in, which I think is what I'm trying to do on Bradshaw, is the city is looking at a shared street initiative that will help alleviate some of these issues.

1438
01:48:22,647 --> 01:48:26,048
[SPEAKER_14]: So I get it with COVID, everyone's stretched thin.

1439
01:48:26,229 --> 01:48:38,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I have had call traffic a few times because the other problem we have here, which makes the speeding tougher, all the rentals from Riverside and Spring, they all come to Bradshaw because we're not permit parking.

1440
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:39,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I had an issue today.

1441
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:41,041
[SPEAKER_14]: We had to go outside and move a car.

1442
01:48:41,501 --> 01:48:46,862
[SPEAKER_14]: A fire truck could not make a swing because there were people blocking the intersection across from us.

1443
01:48:47,383 --> 01:48:50,063
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank God we were home to do that and open that up.

1444
01:48:50,123 --> 01:48:54,925
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I want to thank everybody for their time.

1445
01:48:55,865 --> 01:49:03,748
[SPEAKER_14]: I know this is a citywide issue, but I really think that Councilor Marks hit it on the head that not only can we do better, but we need to do better.

1446
01:49:04,268 --> 01:49:04,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1447
01:49:05,468 --> 01:49:06,208
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much.

1448
01:49:06,228 --> 01:49:07,949
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see.

1449
01:49:09,192 --> 01:49:12,400
[SPEAKER_37]: Paul, Paul, can we please have your name and address for the record?

1450
01:49:13,122 --> 01:49:15,146
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Paul Fombell, I'm on 33 Douglas.

1451
01:49:17,006 --> 01:49:18,467
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'll be brief.

1452
01:49:18,587 --> 01:49:23,768
[SPEAKER_23]: I support all of the ideas for citywide traffic enhancements.

1453
01:49:23,808 --> 01:49:30,070
[SPEAKER_23]: My question or comment is, I would encourage it to be a much broader perspective as opposed to those limited streets.

1454
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:38,453
[SPEAKER_23]: I live off of Summer Street between Main and Winthrop, and that's a NASCAR strip during rush hour every morning and every afternoon.

1455
01:49:39,153 --> 01:49:40,514
[SPEAKER_23]: And people are cutting through, and so

1456
01:49:41,434 --> 01:49:49,397
[SPEAKER_23]: I guess my question is, why are we limiting it to these several streets that very clearly have a need and not more of a citywide initiative?

1457
01:49:49,417 --> 01:49:51,618
[SPEAKER_23]: Because that Berry Park is right there.

1458
01:49:51,638 --> 01:49:52,219
[SPEAKER_23]: There are kids.

1459
01:49:52,279 --> 01:49:53,159
[SPEAKER_23]: I have two little kids.

1460
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:57,681
[SPEAKER_23]: And Berry Park is right in the middle of that race strip.

1461
01:49:58,081 --> 01:50:00,022
[SPEAKER_23]: And cars go flying by every day.

1462
01:50:00,062 --> 01:50:04,264
[SPEAKER_23]: And there's little kids playing in the park, kids playing in the basketball courts, tennis courts.

1463
01:50:05,184 --> 01:50:07,505
[SPEAKER_23]: There's needs for this in a much broader perspective.

1464
01:50:10,117 --> 01:50:11,320
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all I got.

1465
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:12,282
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. President.

1466
01:50:12,302 --> 01:50:12,983
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Paul.

1467
01:50:14,467 --> 01:50:15,249
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

1468
01:50:16,282 --> 01:50:24,026
[SPEAKER_44]: I agree with the previous speaker, and I would ask that Todd Blake, our traffic engineer, look at a citywide approach.

1469
01:50:24,467 --> 01:50:36,793
[SPEAKER_44]: This council has been requesting that for many years, and we tend to take things up piecemeal, like we did on Salt Street and many other streets, because there hasn't been a formalized approach to look at the entire city.

1470
01:50:36,853 --> 01:50:41,716
[SPEAKER_44]: So I am in full support of looking at the entire city, but as I get calls and emails

1471
01:50:42,456 --> 01:50:56,901
[SPEAKER_44]: I react to those calls, Mr. President, and I would ask that Todd Blake be as part of my motion that he look at a citywide approach to traffic calming issues as was mentioned by the previous speaker.

1472
01:50:57,282 --> 01:50:57,642
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1473
01:50:58,222 --> 01:50:58,682
[SPEAKER_37]: Not so much.

1474
01:50:58,702 --> 01:51:00,663
[SPEAKER_37]: Do you want to amend your motion to include

1475
01:51:03,290 --> 01:51:04,791
[SPEAKER_44]: If we could, Mr. President, thank you.

1476
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:06,373
[SPEAKER_44]: I've got it, Mr. President.

1477
01:51:07,154 --> 01:51:07,534
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1478
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:08,735
[SPEAKER_37]: I've got it, Mr. President.

1479
01:51:08,755 --> 01:51:18,524
[SPEAKER_37]: So on that motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks, we have another comment, I believe.

1480
01:51:19,065 --> 01:51:20,066
[SPEAKER_37]: Kelly, did you have your hand up?

1481
01:51:23,989 --> 01:51:24,890
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to try to unmute.

1482
01:51:24,950 --> 01:51:25,671
[SPEAKER_37]: There you go.

1483
01:51:25,711 --> 01:51:26,412
[SPEAKER_62]: Name and address.

1484
01:51:27,503 --> 01:51:30,125
[SPEAKER_62]: Hello, Kelly Catalo 46 Oda Street in Medford.

1485
01:51:30,866 --> 01:51:33,328
[SPEAKER_62]: So, Councilor Marks, thank you very much.

1486
01:51:33,348 --> 01:51:40,454
[SPEAKER_62]: I've been in this neighborhood for many years, off of Washington Street, and we just recently got a sidewalk.

1487
01:51:40,874 --> 01:51:43,336
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you Rick Caraviello, I've been complaining to you for years.

1488
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:54,347
[SPEAKER_62]: a crosswalk because from these side streets to Riverside Ave, there's kind of a cut through where the people can walk with their dogs and we can run and we can get to the lake.

1489
01:51:54,407 --> 01:51:57,209
[SPEAKER_62]: And we want everybody to be able to enjoy our river.

1490
01:51:57,829 --> 01:52:04,734
[SPEAKER_62]: But going across that sidewalk, even though we have the sidewalk, Washington Street is a speedway.

1491
01:52:05,234 --> 01:52:10,296
[SPEAKER_62]: And everyone's trying to avoid Riverside, and they're trying to avoid Salem Street.

1492
01:52:10,456 --> 01:52:22,600
[SPEAKER_62]: I love the idea of the raised crosswalk, that if that crosswalk could turn into a raised crosswalk from Otis over to, I think it's Pembroke that it opens to, that would be awesome.

1493
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:25,041
[SPEAKER_62]: I do appreciate what's happening on Summer Street.

1494
01:52:25,181 --> 01:52:26,721
[SPEAKER_62]: I know what goes on over there as well.

1495
01:52:27,241 --> 01:52:29,102
[SPEAKER_62]: We've got traffic issues everywhere.

1496
01:52:29,202 --> 01:52:32,823
[SPEAKER_62]: But this particular issue, thank you for bringing it up.

1497
01:52:34,344 --> 01:52:34,624
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you.

1498
01:52:37,145 --> 01:52:38,346
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other comments?

1499
01:52:41,348 --> 01:52:44,990
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other comments or questions from the public?

1500
01:52:49,753 --> 01:52:50,334
[SPEAKER_37]: Move approval.

1501
01:52:50,774 --> 01:52:51,415
[SPEAKER_37]: Now we have one more.

1502
01:52:51,435 --> 01:52:54,196
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, it looks like, I believe it's Caitlin Murphy.

1503
01:52:55,998 --> 01:52:57,659
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record.

1504
01:52:58,499 --> 01:53:00,821
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Caitlin Murphy, 51, starting now.

1505
01:53:01,607 --> 01:53:04,948
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope you can hear me because I'm on my walk.

1506
01:53:04,968 --> 01:53:05,968
[SPEAKER_21]: I live in the area.

1507
01:53:06,508 --> 01:53:17,110
[SPEAKER_21]: I have two small children that have been walking down the street with my stroller, and people are driving 40 to 45 miles an hour, and it needs to stop.

1508
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:19,010
[SPEAKER_21]: So I fully support this.

1509
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:23,091
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Marsch, for bringing it to the Council's attention.

1510
01:53:25,491 --> 01:53:26,011
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Kayla.

1511
01:53:26,071 --> 01:53:26,371
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see.

1512
01:53:30,657 --> 01:53:33,358
[SPEAKER_37]: Derek Anderson, name and address for the record, please.

1513
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,241
[SPEAKER_54]: Hi, Derek Anderson, 16 Myrtle.

1514
01:53:37,881 --> 01:53:41,923
[SPEAKER_54]: I just want to thank Councilor Marks for introducing this.

1515
01:53:42,303 --> 01:53:43,284
[SPEAKER_54]: I totally agree.

1516
01:53:43,304 --> 01:53:44,645
[SPEAKER_54]: I wasn't aware of a petition on this.

1517
01:53:44,865 --> 01:53:48,927
[SPEAKER_54]: I live near the intersection of Washington and Spring, so I'm very aware of this.

1518
01:53:49,027 --> 01:53:51,028
[SPEAKER_54]: I drop children off in that area.

1519
01:53:51,048 --> 01:54:00,153
[SPEAKER_54]: And just from September to March of this past school year, I witnessed on at least three occasions kids almost getting hit by cars

1520
01:54:00,825 --> 01:54:07,809
[SPEAKER_54]: zooming past buses, to which point the buses are actually parking diagonally across Spring Street to try to slow those vehicles down.

1521
01:54:07,869 --> 01:54:09,530
[SPEAKER_54]: So it's definitely an issue in that location.

1522
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:11,491
[SPEAKER_54]: So I'll just voice my support for this.

1523
01:54:12,312 --> 01:54:12,632
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

1524
01:54:13,192 --> 01:54:13,593
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1525
01:54:19,116 --> 01:54:22,518
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, we have, let's see, Carolyn Morrison.

1526
01:54:24,939 --> 01:54:26,140
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

1527
01:54:26,883 --> 01:54:29,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Carolyn Morrison, 26 West.

1528
01:54:29,845 --> 01:54:34,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to voice my support as well for this motion.

1529
01:54:34,968 --> 01:54:40,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen the raised crosswalk work on Winthrop Street between 16 and Boston Ave.

1530
01:54:41,772 --> 01:54:51,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And living on West Street, it's a popular cut through from Winthrop to Route 16, and cars are flying down the road all the time.

1531
01:54:52,299 --> 01:54:54,120
[SPEAKER_07]: So I also support a more

1532
01:54:55,089 --> 01:54:59,653
[SPEAKER_07]: citywide look at this, because it is a problem.

1533
01:55:00,974 --> 01:55:01,915
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay, thank you.

1534
01:55:04,538 --> 01:55:05,879
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, we have another comment.

1535
01:55:05,919 --> 01:55:07,880
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's see, Joanna.

1536
01:55:10,963 --> 01:55:12,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Joanna, name and address for the record, please.

1537
01:55:13,525 --> 01:55:15,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Joanna Quintero Mejia, 35 Early Ave.

1538
01:55:15,647 --> 01:55:21,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually calling about my mom's house on Woburn Street, from High Street to Suffolk Street.

1539
01:55:23,211 --> 01:55:24,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've lived there my whole life.

1540
01:55:25,293 --> 01:55:27,594
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a show for my whole family.

1541
01:55:27,674 --> 01:55:35,020
[SPEAKER_06]: We sit in the window sometimes during the bad weather and just watch the cars come off of high and take that turn onto Suffolk.

1542
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:35,980
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's a cut through.

1543
01:55:37,481 --> 01:55:40,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody was hit by a car there not long ago, actually.

1544
01:55:41,264 --> 01:55:44,547
[SPEAKER_06]: And a street sweeper actually turned over when I was a kid.

1545
01:55:44,847 --> 01:55:47,549
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's a horrible, horrible turn right there.

1546
01:55:48,349 --> 01:55:51,852
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know what I'm talking about, it's high to Woburn to Suffolk.

1547
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:56,302
[SPEAKER_06]: and we watched them do complete donuts, taking the corner there.

1548
01:55:56,342 --> 01:56:02,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So that should be something to look at also, but thank you for letting me speak.

1549
01:56:02,745 --> 01:56:03,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1550
01:56:03,405 --> 01:56:03,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1551
01:56:05,566 --> 01:56:06,346
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other comments?

1552
01:56:13,529 --> 01:56:14,590
[SPEAKER_38]: Jennifer Kerwood.

1553
01:56:17,426 --> 01:56:19,827
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, I just wanted to echo what everyone else has been saying.

1554
01:56:19,887 --> 01:56:21,787
[SPEAKER_27]: I really do think this is a citywide issue.

1555
01:56:21,907 --> 01:56:23,007
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, sorry, I have to say who I am.

1556
01:56:23,307 --> 01:56:25,008
[SPEAKER_27]: Jennifer Kerwin, 43 Willis Avenue.

1557
01:56:25,288 --> 01:56:27,448
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for letting me speak.

1558
01:56:29,389 --> 01:56:30,809
[SPEAKER_27]: As I said, I live on Willis Avenue.

1559
01:56:31,349 --> 01:56:33,170
[SPEAKER_27]: Everyone is using it to avoid Mystic.

1560
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:40,072
[SPEAKER_27]: And with all of the stop signs, as it's a crisscross of one ways, it's also a bus route.

1561
01:56:40,752 --> 01:56:42,292
[SPEAKER_27]: Everyone's playing chicken every morning.

1562
01:56:42,372 --> 01:56:45,693
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that right now, obviously, with school being out and not knowing what

1563
01:56:46,235 --> 01:56:48,058
[SPEAKER_27]: that will look like come September.

1564
01:56:48,879 --> 01:57:00,775
[SPEAKER_27]: It has been a massive issue, like a rude, rage-inducing people rushing to get to work, dropping their kids off, doing whatever, and you basically, there's no movement.

1565
01:57:01,296 --> 01:57:02,017
[SPEAKER_27]: I've witnessed

1566
01:57:05,626 --> 01:57:12,994
[SPEAKER_27]: almost like fisticuffs and people beeping and just laying on the horn because they can't get through because there are cars parked on either side.

1567
01:57:13,614 --> 01:57:18,960
[SPEAKER_27]: And so once someone makes a turn off of Harvard, there's no way to see what's ahead of you.

1568
01:57:18,980 --> 01:57:22,403
[SPEAKER_27]: And if there's no way to go, everyone's just at a standstill.

1569
01:57:22,423 --> 01:57:23,364
[SPEAKER_27]: It's blocking traffic.

1570
01:57:24,512 --> 01:57:31,716
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'd also like to say that the one time that I needed emergency services, a fire truck could not get through.

1571
01:57:32,216 --> 01:57:41,361
[SPEAKER_27]: So I don't know if that's an issue of having too many cars, having cars being parked on both sides, bad, you know, poor parking jobs, but I do think that

1572
01:57:42,458 --> 01:57:54,500
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, considering changes to the way the traffic flows, one thing we could do is turn this into a revenue source at some point, because there could be fines involved.

1573
01:57:54,921 --> 01:57:59,661
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's the best way, unfortunately, to implement new changes.

1574
01:57:59,681 --> 01:58:01,962
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all.

1575
01:58:02,002 --> 01:58:02,662
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1576
01:58:05,863 --> 01:58:06,723
[SPEAKER_37]: OK, let's see.

1577
01:58:09,577 --> 01:58:12,759
[SPEAKER_37]: It doesn't appear that there's any more questions or comments regarding this.

1578
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:16,141
[SPEAKER_37]: So, Clerk Curtis, did this have a second?

1579
01:58:18,383 --> 01:58:25,027
[SPEAKER_57]: I believe the original motion was Councilor Marks as amended twice by Councilor Marks with Councilor Knight second.

1580
01:58:25,708 --> 01:58:26,008
[SPEAKER_26]: Perfect.

1581
01:58:26,068 --> 01:58:26,628
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay, great.

1582
01:58:27,309 --> 01:58:34,113
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Marks twice and seconded by Councilor Knight.

1583
01:58:34,533 --> 01:58:35,714
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Curtis, please call the roll.

1584
01:58:37,515 --> 01:58:38,056
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs.

1585
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:39,370
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1586
01:58:40,711 --> 01:58:41,592
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Carabiello.

1587
01:58:41,972 --> 01:58:42,272
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes.

1588
01:58:43,113 --> 01:58:43,553
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight.

1589
01:58:43,953 --> 01:58:44,153
Yes.

1590
01:58:44,654 --> 01:58:45,194
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks.

1591
01:58:49,877 --> 01:58:50,057
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1592
01:58:50,077 --> 01:58:51,118
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks, thank you.

1593
01:58:51,178 --> 01:58:51,378
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1594
01:58:53,319 --> 01:58:53,920
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell.

1595
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:54,740
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1596
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:55,941
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1597
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:57,240
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1598
01:58:58,001 --> 01:58:58,721
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco.

1599
01:58:59,182 --> 01:59:03,605
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1600
01:59:03,625 --> 01:59:05,346
[SPEAKER_37]: 2-0-491 offered by Vice President Carviello.

1601
01:59:05,946 --> 01:59:13,892
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council ask the Building Commissioner to address the City Council on the recent changes to the residential building permit process.

1602
01:59:14,792 --> 01:59:15,653
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Carviello.

1603
01:59:16,257 --> 01:59:17,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1604
01:59:17,278 --> 01:59:30,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, over the last week or so, I've gotten many calls with regards to a change in the building permit process for homes that are over 75 years old or older.

1605
01:59:31,209 --> 01:59:40,056
[SPEAKER_16]: From what I have been told, it was part of the historical commission, something that was passed some years ago.

1606
01:59:40,676 --> 01:59:45,360
[SPEAKER_16]: And for some reason, it's now being enforced four years later.

1607
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:50,742
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I could have the building commissioner, I think I saw him here.

1608
01:59:52,783 --> 01:59:53,664
[SPEAKER_37]: He's on the line.

1609
01:59:55,065 --> 01:59:56,925
[SPEAKER_37]: Paul Moki, the building commissioner with us.

1610
01:59:56,986 --> 01:59:58,046
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to try to, there you go.

1611
01:59:58,066 --> 02:00:01,168
[SPEAKER_37]: You're unmuted, Paul, if you wouldn't mind.

1612
02:00:01,208 --> 02:00:02,208
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1613
02:00:02,228 --> 02:00:03,529
[SPEAKER_52]: Good evening, councillors.

1614
02:00:04,709 --> 02:00:13,974
[SPEAKER_52]: To address your question, Councillor Caviello, about a week and a half ago, we had a meeting with the store commission and the mayor's office regarding some of the

1615
02:00:15,896 --> 02:00:19,798
[SPEAKER_52]: conditions in the demolition delay ordinance, as you said, was passed several years ago.

1616
02:00:20,578 --> 02:00:27,762
[SPEAKER_52]: And what the discussion really evolved around was- Mr. President, Mr. Moki, I'm sorry to interrupt.

1617
02:00:28,382 --> 02:00:39,087
[SPEAKER_43]: But I think just a few years ago, the only changes that we made to the demolition delay ordinance was homes that were constructed within 75 years and expanding the demolition delay from six months to 18 months.

1618
02:00:39,187 --> 02:00:43,148
[SPEAKER_43]: But the legislative body made no other changes other than that.

1619
02:00:43,209 --> 02:00:44,109
[SPEAKER_43]: So that's what I think is

1620
02:00:44,642 --> 02:00:45,922
[SPEAKER_43]: making this confusing to us.

1621
02:00:46,642 --> 02:00:51,683
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, when we made those changes to the demolition delay ordinance, that was it.

1622
02:00:51,703 --> 02:00:52,723
[SPEAKER_43]: It was just those two items.

1623
02:00:52,803 --> 02:00:57,284
[SPEAKER_43]: It wasn't this broad sweep to say, you know, start changing the way that you practice.

1624
02:00:57,664 --> 02:00:59,565
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that that's what the issue is.

1625
02:00:59,585 --> 02:01:09,907
[SPEAKER_43]: But I just wanted to correct what you said there, that when we changed the demolition delay ordinance, all we did was change from houses built before 1900 to houses built within the last 75 years.

1626
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:16,031
[SPEAKER_43]: expanding the demolition delay period from six months to 18 months.

1627
02:01:16,791 --> 02:01:18,752
[SPEAKER_43]: So I think that's very important that we point that out.

1628
02:01:18,772 --> 02:01:28,754
[SPEAKER_43]: There's been no passage of an ordinance that changed anything that we did here, other than the amount of time that the demolition delay was in place and the age of the home that was subject to demolition delay.

1629
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:31,395
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes, that's correct, Counselor.

1630
02:01:31,495 --> 02:01:38,157
[SPEAKER_52]: And that was, as you said, the ordinance was for the demolition delay and those were the two changes of 75 years and increasingly

1631
02:01:40,615 --> 02:01:42,355
[SPEAKER_52]: time period from 12 to 18 months.

1632
02:01:42,415 --> 02:01:48,617
[SPEAKER_52]: But what the discussion, as I was saying, really revolved around was some of the wording.

1633
02:01:48,677 --> 02:01:55,198
[SPEAKER_52]: If you look in the actual ordinance itself right now, it talks about demolition of the structure, which is pretty clear.

1634
02:01:55,318 --> 02:02:03,039
[SPEAKER_52]: And then part of that same definition, it also elaborates where it states that or any part thereof.

1635
02:02:03,159 --> 02:02:06,660
[SPEAKER_52]: And I think that's where some of the questions were concerned about

1636
02:02:07,405 --> 02:02:22,236
[SPEAKER_52]: is a total demolition of a total demolition, as I said, that's self-explanatory, but the different parts thereof that were in the definition of the demolition in the historic ordinance, that was where some of the questions were discussed in this meeting.

1637
02:02:22,776 --> 02:02:31,043
[SPEAKER_52]: And as a result of that, the historic commission has a pamphlet that they have, and it's got commonly asked questions section.

1638
02:02:31,743 --> 02:02:34,345
[SPEAKER_52]: And that was really the main focus of the meeting and in that

1639
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:41,584
[SPEAKER_52]: a section of several bullet points about different scopes of work that can be performed on different properties.

1640
02:02:41,704 --> 02:02:53,030
[SPEAKER_52]: And since that meeting, to answer your question, also Councilor Caviello, about a week and a half ago, so we've been working with the Historic Commission very closely.

1641
02:02:53,050 --> 02:03:01,595
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm in touch with the chairman almost on a daily basis right now, and I've also looped her into a software program so that she has access to the

1642
02:03:02,261 --> 02:03:07,965
[SPEAKER_52]: permits that are currently under review and what type of jobs that those permit applications entail.

1643
02:03:08,786 --> 02:03:12,289
[SPEAKER_52]: And right now, we're still, it's a fairly new process for us.

1644
02:03:12,409 --> 02:03:14,210
[SPEAKER_52]: They said it's about a week and a half old.

1645
02:03:14,791 --> 02:03:21,396
[SPEAKER_52]: And we're still working through exactly what comes under their purview and what doesn't.

1646
02:03:21,476 --> 02:03:27,981
[SPEAKER_52]: So what we started out as a guideline were the four bullet points in their pamphlet under the commonly asked questions section.

1647
02:03:28,601 --> 02:03:30,663
[SPEAKER_52]: And then because of the broad

1648
02:03:31,525 --> 02:03:34,006
[SPEAKER_52]: scope of work that's done in a lot of residential properties.

1649
02:03:34,626 --> 02:03:48,751
[SPEAKER_52]: We're just kind of, I guess, slowing the process down right now and make sure that we're on the same page in terms of what needs to review by the historic commission and what doesn't really come under their peer review.

1650
02:03:48,851 --> 02:03:52,172
[SPEAKER_52]: And as Councilor Knight said, that was a big part of the question right now.

1651
02:03:53,393 --> 02:03:53,953
[SPEAKER_43]: Councilor Knight.

1652
02:03:55,013 --> 02:03:58,575
[SPEAKER_43]: So it's my understanding that under the current application that the

1653
02:04:00,030 --> 02:04:02,411
[SPEAKER_43]: historic commission is using for a demolition delay.

1654
02:04:02,431 --> 02:04:12,733
[SPEAKER_43]: If someone wanted to change the windows out on their home, maybe move them six inches to the left, six inches to the right, they'd have to go before the historical commission in order to get an approval to do that?

1655
02:04:13,794 --> 02:04:20,956
[SPEAKER_52]: Well, that's some of the things we're working on right now, because there are some provisions in those bullet points to address windows.

1656
02:04:21,756 --> 02:04:26,157
[SPEAKER_52]: And I think it's kind of hard to paint some of these items with a broad brush.

1657
02:04:27,118 --> 02:04:31,623
[SPEAKER_52]: Because there are certain sections that reference interior renovations where windows are affected.

1658
02:04:32,183 --> 02:04:36,928
[SPEAKER_52]: And there's another section that says that, you know, it may not be required a purview.

1659
02:04:36,968 --> 02:04:41,593
[SPEAKER_52]: So again, it's not to be too vague about that, but we're trying to work through that.

1660
02:04:42,354 --> 02:04:46,498
[SPEAKER_52]: Because I think we need to get, you know, definite instructions for homeowners.

1661
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:57,422
[SPEAKER_43]: Let me ask you, if someone came today to your office and said, I want a permit to not take these windows out, blow them out and put a huge picture window in, would they be allowed to get that permit or would they have to go to the historical commission?

1662
02:04:59,902 --> 02:05:03,863
[SPEAKER_52]: That's what we try to come to terms with.

1663
02:05:03,903 --> 02:05:06,944
[SPEAKER_52]: A lot of times what we'll do is look at the elevation drawings and plans.

1664
02:05:06,984 --> 02:05:11,825
[SPEAKER_52]: And if it's, I think the way that, and we should be finalizing some of this very shortly.

1665
02:05:11,865 --> 02:05:13,605
[SPEAKER_52]: I think what happens is also,

1666
02:05:14,783 --> 02:05:16,864
[SPEAKER_52]: what the scope of the work looks like from the exterior.

1667
02:05:16,884 --> 02:05:26,105
[SPEAKER_52]: If it's, in my opinion, the way I'm interpreting it right now is if it's a minor window changes and it doesn't really affect the aesthetics of the outside too much, no, they don't.

1668
02:05:26,125 --> 02:05:28,466
[SPEAKER_52]: I don't think they're really too concerned with that.

1669
02:05:28,486 --> 02:05:37,688
[SPEAKER_52]: But if it's something that's gonna affect the, again, the exterior layout and design of the building, I think that's some of the window changes they wanna take a look at.

1670
02:05:37,708 --> 02:05:40,468
[SPEAKER_49]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1671
02:05:41,349 --> 02:05:42,869
[SPEAKER_36]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1672
02:05:44,107 --> 02:06:05,652
[SPEAKER_49]: I hate to interrupt, but Mr. Moki, if let's say my neighbor who has a house that is 80 years old and she's a senior citizen and she needs to redo her windows, we have to now wait and get approval from the historical mission to get approval to get these.

1673
02:06:06,833 --> 02:06:10,874
[SPEAKER_49]: This could be a huge burden, financial burden on our seniors.

1674
02:06:10,934 --> 02:06:11,854
[SPEAKER_49]: The only reason why I know this.

1675
02:06:12,572 --> 02:06:22,494
[SPEAKER_49]: as my brother-in-law purchased a home, didn't know it was a historical site, and what would have cost him $5,000 for windows turned into over $25,000.

1676
02:06:22,895 --> 02:06:24,015
[SPEAKER_49]: I find this a little scary.

1677
02:06:25,895 --> 02:06:40,959
[SPEAKER_52]: Well, I think there's also, in that section I was referring to, Councilor Scott, there's some notation in that also that routine maintenance, and it does include windows under routine maintenance, and I don't think that's

1678
02:06:41,821 --> 02:06:43,963
[SPEAKER_52]: That particular project we need to review now.

1679
02:06:45,944 --> 02:06:46,285
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

1680
02:06:46,305 --> 02:06:48,947
[SPEAKER_52]: Sorry.

1681
02:06:49,687 --> 02:06:52,830
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. Moki, through the president, Mr. Moki.

1682
02:06:54,111 --> 02:07:01,516
[SPEAKER_43]: Underneath the new standards that are trying to be implemented now, interior work would also have to be, certain interior work would also need to have to be approved by the historic commission.

1683
02:07:02,777 --> 02:07:03,698
[SPEAKER_52]: Am I understanding that correctly?

1684
02:07:03,738 --> 02:07:05,219
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes, it could be subject to that.

1685
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:08,762
[SPEAKER_52]: If I could read you one of the bullet points, council, it may help you.

1686
02:07:09,162 --> 02:07:09,563
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes, please.

1687
02:07:10,396 --> 02:07:22,002
[SPEAKER_52]: One of the bullet points that we have implemented since this meeting states that the gutting of a building's interior to the point where exterior features such as window, doors, walls, et cetera, are impacted.

1688
02:07:22,062 --> 02:07:24,663
[SPEAKER_52]: So again, it could be this.

1689
02:07:25,489 --> 02:07:33,896
[SPEAKER_43]: So in essence, if somebody wanted to make their house handicap accessible after a tragic event that happened in their family, they'd have to go before the historic commission to make the house handicap accessible as well?

1690
02:07:34,156 --> 02:07:35,958
[SPEAKER_43]: A circumstance could arise in that?

1691
02:07:36,418 --> 02:07:39,320
[SPEAKER_43]: It could potentially arise, yes.

1692
02:07:39,661 --> 02:07:49,629
[SPEAKER_43]: Somebody wanted to rip down a deck and put a ramp in, move a door so that they can meet the requirements of making a wheelchair pass through, they'd have to be subject to these requirements?

1693
02:07:50,174 --> 02:07:53,196
[SPEAKER_52]: Well, I don't think in that particular example you gave, no.

1694
02:07:53,236 --> 02:08:02,081
[SPEAKER_52]: I don't think they would be because it's a state zoning act which gives exemption to handicap ramps for accessibility to one or two families.

1695
02:08:02,101 --> 02:08:06,564
[SPEAKER_52]: So in that particular case, I don't think that they would need to review that, no.

1696
02:08:08,125 --> 02:08:14,789
[SPEAKER_43]: And is this commonplace in other communities that the Historical Commission goes this far and gets this far involved in building and development?

1697
02:08:16,002 --> 02:08:22,427
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm not sure, I haven't had a chance to see what some of our surrounding communities are doing on that right now, so I'm not sure about that.

1698
02:08:23,768 --> 02:08:28,032
[SPEAKER_43]: And also, Mr. Mulkey, can you answer, or maybe we'll offer this as a bee paper?

1699
02:08:28,712 --> 02:08:33,276
[SPEAKER_43]: I know you can't answer off the top of your head, but can we get a report back from the administration?

1700
02:08:34,197 --> 02:08:45,586
[SPEAKER_43]: Since amending the demolition delay ordinance, how many homes that have been subject to demolition delay have actually been restored to the historic state?

1701
02:08:47,409 --> 02:08:56,936
[SPEAKER_43]: Because I mean, we have an operative ordinance in there, but if it's not meeting the objectives, and now it's turning into this second layer of a building department, I don't know if that's good public policy, Mr. President.

1702
02:08:57,076 --> 02:09:14,207
[SPEAKER_43]: If we haven't saved any houses or restored any houses, and all this is doing is creating another layer of bureaucracy and another layer of government, the government within a government, for individuals to get permitting to make home improvements on the largest purchase that they make in their life, their kingdom, their castle, their home.

1703
02:09:15,595 --> 02:09:17,796
[SPEAKER_43]: I think this might have to be looked at.

1704
02:09:17,916 --> 02:09:25,438
[SPEAKER_43]: This certainly doesn't fall within the scope that I feel as though would be the intent of the legislation at the time it was passed or at the time that it was amended.

1705
02:09:26,159 --> 02:09:27,999
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'd like to offer that as a B paper.

1706
02:09:28,059 --> 02:09:41,444
[SPEAKER_43]: If we can find out how many homes since amending the resolution have actually been saved and restored, as opposed to how many wanted to demolish an old and decrepit building like Pacelli's

1707
02:09:42,162 --> 02:09:47,686
[SPEAKER_43]: and do something that might add some substantial community gain and also some tax revenue to the community.

1708
02:09:48,246 --> 02:10:00,134
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, how many of those projects just went to the wayside, and the building's still the building that it was, and the demolition delay, all it did was kill the sale, or kill the redevelopment or repurposing of a property.

1709
02:10:00,575 --> 02:10:11,182
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that's important to look at, Mr. President, because, you know, if the goal is to restore historic homes, and our demolition delay ordinance isn't meeting that goal, then why do we have it?

1710
02:10:17,745 --> 02:10:18,625
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1711
02:10:18,645 --> 02:10:27,249
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, so we have a number of people that have their hands up, but I believe Councilor Carviello, did you?

1712
02:10:27,869 --> 02:10:28,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Mr. President.

1713
02:10:29,390 --> 02:10:36,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Mulkey, again, the building department generates about a million and a half dollars to the city and building permits, correct?

1714
02:10:38,146 --> 02:10:42,267
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes, that's sometimes a little more than that lately, but that's a little more than that.

1715
02:10:42,287 --> 02:10:49,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, and here we are, you know, we've got a $10 million deficit, and here we are pushing money away, which is a little confusing to me.

1716
02:10:50,210 --> 02:10:53,251
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, the historical commission meets once a month.

1717
02:10:53,791 --> 02:11:00,953
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you going to, what are they going to do when there's 40 people that are going before them, you know, with permits?

1718
02:11:02,954 --> 02:11:05,395
[SPEAKER_52]: Well, I'm sorry, go ahead, Konstantin.

1719
02:11:06,427 --> 02:11:15,312
[SPEAKER_16]: They only meet once a month, and they don't have any funding to hire people to sit there and sort through all these.

1720
02:11:16,353 --> 02:11:18,194
[SPEAKER_16]: People could be waiting two months for a building permit.

1721
02:11:19,895 --> 02:11:25,839
[SPEAKER_52]: Well, I don't know, again, how this is going to play out as far as the wait that you just mentioned.

1722
02:11:25,879 --> 02:11:31,503
[SPEAKER_52]: But right now, the correspondence I've been having with them, it's been going pretty well.

1723
02:11:31,563 --> 02:11:33,284
[SPEAKER_52]: They're getting back to me pretty quickly.

1724
02:11:33,894 --> 02:11:41,677
[SPEAKER_52]: And again, I know it's just started, and I know we're still working on the kinks, but we're trying to implement this the best we can.

1725
02:11:41,697 --> 02:11:50,320
[SPEAKER_52]: I certainly, as everyone knows, we strived, and I think we've done a really good job of getting processing permits pretty quickly over the years.

1726
02:11:51,101 --> 02:12:02,525
[SPEAKER_52]: And I know this could be perceived as another layer, but I think the intent of this, we're trying to just make sure that, again, everyone's adhering to the commission's guidelines and the renovations they're doing,

1727
02:12:03,277 --> 02:12:07,340
[SPEAKER_52]: on some of these historic properties are done in a manner that the city wants it to be done.

1728
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:12,865
[SPEAKER_52]: And moving forward, I can't answer for them with the timelines, but so far so good.

1729
02:12:13,986 --> 02:12:18,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I ask what prompted this after all these years?

1730
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:25,435
[SPEAKER_52]: I think the historic commission asked for the meeting, and I think they had questions on

1731
02:12:26,075 --> 02:12:33,777
[SPEAKER_52]: some of the projects that were underway with the demolition delay ordinance and some that weren't going before them that they felt it should have.

1732
02:12:34,657 --> 02:12:54,563
[SPEAKER_52]: And when these specific bullet points that were raised during this meeting came to light as a big part of the meeting, and I think they wanted to just review why some of these projects weren't falling under these bullet points and came to a consensus of moving forward, how we want to address all these things that they have

1733
02:12:55,396 --> 02:12:56,897
[SPEAKER_52]: as recommendations in their pamphlet.

1734
02:12:58,399 --> 02:13:01,642
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd say kind of sounds like more like a bit of a power play to me than anything else.

1735
02:13:03,343 --> 02:13:06,807
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll yield the floor to my other councillors.

1736
02:13:08,528 --> 02:13:09,869
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1737
02:13:09,929 --> 02:13:11,571
[SPEAKER_37]: At this point, I recognize Councillor Marks.

1738
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:14,294
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1739
02:13:14,314 --> 02:13:17,376
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Commissioner Mulkey, for being on tonight.

1740
02:13:19,178 --> 02:13:21,040
[SPEAKER_44]: When you mentioned some projects,

1741
02:13:21,901 --> 02:13:27,245
[SPEAKER_44]: that the historic commission wanted to see come before them.

1742
02:13:27,605 --> 02:13:32,749
[SPEAKER_44]: Does that include porches?

1743
02:13:34,810 --> 02:13:37,051
[SPEAKER_52]: That's a good question, Councilor Marks.

1744
02:13:37,132 --> 02:13:49,440
[SPEAKER_52]: And again, we're trying to work through the procedures in this initial stages of this new policy or the new practice we have in reviewing these permits.

1745
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:50,881
[SPEAKER_52]: So on the one hand,

1746
02:13:51,910 --> 02:13:57,174
[SPEAKER_52]: Some of these bullet points talk about affecting different parts of the exterior of the structure.

1747
02:13:57,274 --> 02:14:11,445
[SPEAKER_52]: And again, there is a comment section to these frequently asked questions where they talk about routine maintenance, renovation, certain types of renovations that does not include new porches, decks, and windows.

1748
02:14:11,525 --> 02:14:18,410
[SPEAKER_52]: So I think as we move forward this week and next week, we're going to probably get some definitive answers on that.

1749
02:14:18,430 --> 02:14:20,532
[SPEAKER_52]: But right now, a new porch or a deck

1750
02:14:21,261 --> 02:14:27,204
[SPEAKER_52]: is one of the things they're classifying as routine maintenance and renovations that they do not need to review.

1751
02:14:28,185 --> 02:14:28,245
[SPEAKER_44]: OK.

1752
02:14:28,745 --> 02:14:30,646
[SPEAKER_44]: And would that also include vinyl siding?

1753
02:14:32,247 --> 02:14:32,507
[SPEAKER_52]: No.

1754
02:14:32,607 --> 02:14:35,209
[SPEAKER_52]: Yeah, I do not think they need to review vinyl siding.

1755
02:14:35,229 --> 02:14:40,512
[SPEAKER_52]: That's not one of the areas where they put in this pamphlet.

1756
02:14:41,112 --> 02:14:41,212
[SPEAKER_52]: OK.

1757
02:14:41,993 --> 02:14:46,015
[SPEAKER_44]: And prior to the meeting that you held with the city administration,

1758
02:14:47,541 --> 02:14:51,022
[SPEAKER_44]: What items were you actually sending?

1759
02:14:51,442 --> 02:15:05,385
[SPEAKER_44]: Was it just demolition to the historic commission or was it these generalized construction like replacement windows and porches and roof lines and everything else that's involved?

1760
02:15:06,325 --> 02:15:09,106
[SPEAKER_52]: No, prior to this meeting, it was pretty much demolition.

1761
02:15:09,646 --> 02:15:10,466
[SPEAKER_52]: It was demolition.

1762
02:15:10,806 --> 02:15:11,006
[SPEAKER_52]: Okay.

1763
02:15:12,030 --> 02:15:26,213
[SPEAKER_44]: And you're saying the language that states demolition delay or parts thereof, the or parts thereof is the issue that they're hanging their hat on saying, well, this involves more than the demolition of a building.

1764
02:15:27,434 --> 02:15:33,395
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes, I think the or parts thereof is really what brought into play some of these other issues they raised during this meeting.

1765
02:15:33,695 --> 02:15:38,396
[SPEAKER_52]: And I think that's just what it was, the wording where it said or parts thereof.

1766
02:15:38,931 --> 02:15:46,695
[SPEAKER_52]: Because that's such a vague term that that's what we were trying to clarify, get some more definition on during that meeting.

1767
02:15:46,815 --> 02:15:48,456
[SPEAKER_44]: It absolutely is a vague term.

1768
02:15:48,516 --> 02:15:58,382
[SPEAKER_44]: And I would ask, Mr. President, if we could, when the Commissioner Moki does arrive at whatever the standards are going to be that he shared with the council,

1769
02:15:59,022 --> 02:16:19,865
[SPEAKER_44]: Because I, as one member of the council, never envisioned to have residents that may want to, under this demolition delay, may want to do some work on their property and have them run into a financial cost or say, you know what, it's not worth doing this additional work because I don't feel like waiting or going through another process.

1770
02:16:20,464 --> 02:16:26,346
[SPEAKER_44]: So I, as one member of the council, am extremely interested in seeing what you come up with, Commissioner Mulkey.

1771
02:16:27,006 --> 02:16:38,630
[SPEAKER_44]: And if that's the case, I would move forward on redrafting our ordinance to exclude that language of all parts thereof to make sure that we're not putting an undue burden.

1772
02:16:38,910 --> 02:16:40,931
[SPEAKER_44]: I think we all want to save historic property.

1773
02:16:41,471 --> 02:16:47,355
[SPEAKER_44]: But I'd venture to say 70 or 80% of our homes are greater than 75 years old.

1774
02:16:48,016 --> 02:16:55,221
[SPEAKER_44]: And I don't see how logistically, we already have an overburdened historic commission, an overburdened building commission department.

1775
02:16:55,721 --> 02:17:06,469
[SPEAKER_44]: And to create another layer that may discourage residents from doing work on their personal property, and then maybe an additional expense is not something that I signed up for.

1776
02:17:06,549 --> 02:17:09,130
[SPEAKER_44]: And I'll make sure that that doesn't come to fruition.

1777
02:17:09,631 --> 02:17:09,931
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1778
02:17:10,998 --> 02:17:11,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1779
02:17:11,478 --> 02:17:11,738
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1780
02:17:11,778 --> 02:17:12,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilmembers.

1781
02:17:12,719 --> 02:17:15,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

1782
02:17:16,021 --> 02:17:17,121
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1783
02:17:17,161 --> 02:17:20,103
[SPEAKER_43]: And through you to Mr. Moki, and I apologize if you mentioned this earlier.

1784
02:17:20,743 --> 02:17:28,588
[SPEAKER_43]: Is there some sort of standard that the commission is referring to or using or utilizing that would put them in a position to expand

1785
02:17:29,286 --> 02:17:32,927
[SPEAKER_43]: the application of the Demolition Delay Ordinance this far?

1786
02:17:33,007 --> 02:17:36,647
[SPEAKER_43]: Is there a federal document, a state document, some sort of guideline that they're going by?

1787
02:17:36,707 --> 02:17:42,088
[SPEAKER_43]: Or is this just kind of willy-nilly, you're going to figure it out as we go along type of stuff?

1788
02:17:43,129 --> 02:17:47,489
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes, that's one of the items we discussed during that meeting, Counselor.

1789
02:17:47,669 --> 02:17:51,650
[SPEAKER_52]: And that is right in the Commonly Asked Questions pamphlet.

1790
02:17:52,390 --> 02:17:55,291
[SPEAKER_52]: And the guidelines they refer to is

1791
02:17:57,162 --> 02:18:01,525
[SPEAKER_52]: The guideline, the title of that is National Park Service Guidelines.

1792
02:18:02,445 --> 02:18:10,991
[SPEAKER_52]: It sounds like it's some type of federal guidelines, but that's what they are referring to where they got these different bullet points in their pamphlet.

1793
02:18:12,212 --> 02:18:13,693
[SPEAKER_52]: National Park Service Guidelines?

1794
02:18:14,773 --> 02:18:15,474
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, that's right.

1795
02:18:15,994 --> 02:18:21,618
[SPEAKER_43]: Don't you think that would be more applicable to log cabins in the woods than it would be about an urban environment with 60,000 people?

1796
02:18:24,452 --> 02:18:29,576
[SPEAKER_52]: Yeah, I'm not sure how they arrived at that particular guideline, but that's what's in there.

1797
02:18:30,737 --> 02:18:37,543
[SPEAKER_43]: And since, you know, you've been around for quite a bit of time, Mr. Moki, and you've seen, you know, how this process works.

1798
02:18:38,063 --> 02:18:47,251
[SPEAKER_43]: I mean, is demolition delay being used as a tool to preserve housing or is demolition delay being used as a tool to control development in the community?

1799
02:18:47,291 --> 02:18:50,634
[SPEAKER_43]: I mean, do you feel as though the application is appropriate?

1800
02:18:50,994 --> 02:18:58,255
[SPEAKER_43]: Do you feel as though, you know, we're really going down a street that we're looking at preserving historic houses?

1801
02:18:58,315 --> 02:19:02,156
[SPEAKER_43]: Or do you really think that we're going down the street saying, oh my God, this guy wants to do something.

1802
02:19:02,576 --> 02:19:04,097
[SPEAKER_43]: Why are we letting this happen?

1803
02:19:04,137 --> 02:19:05,277
[SPEAKER_43]: Let's go make it historic.

1804
02:19:06,317 --> 02:19:09,318
[SPEAKER_43]: Because I feel like everything we're doing is reactionary, Mr. President.

1805
02:19:09,338 --> 02:19:16,879
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't feel like there's any proactive work on establishing what houses in this community would be historic until the day they get an application that they want to knock it down.

1806
02:19:17,715 --> 02:19:28,221
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think that that's problematic, you know, if we're going to create historic districts and historic commissions, I got a phone call today from somebody who had purchased a home that I applied for a demolition delay permit.

1807
02:19:28,861 --> 02:19:35,505
[SPEAKER_43]: And, you know, they deemed the home historically significant, and they're moving to create it as a single home historic district.

1808
02:19:36,425 --> 02:19:40,948
[SPEAKER_43]: So now here we have a person that invested a ton of money in a home, you know, he was ready to move in one direction.

1809
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,742
[SPEAKER_43]: as it goes down that street, the game changes.

1810
02:19:45,262 --> 02:19:47,644
[SPEAKER_43]: So I don't think it's fair to people, Mr. President, quite frankly.

1811
02:19:47,664 --> 02:19:54,388
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, I don't mind having people come into the community and make investments in our community and play by the rules.

1812
02:19:54,488 --> 02:20:02,113
[SPEAKER_43]: But I think it's unfair to people that are trying to invest and improve our community to have to be scratching their head and wondering what the certainty and uncertainty is going to be.

1813
02:20:03,174 --> 02:20:08,337
[SPEAKER_43]: That coupled with the impacts this has on our homeowners, you know, I'm having a very difficult time with this.

1814
02:20:08,397 --> 02:20:09,618
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think, you know,

1815
02:20:10,498 --> 02:20:16,183
[SPEAKER_43]: be inclined to support Councilor Mack's amendment to the existing ordinance, you know, should this thing not be worked out appropriately.

1816
02:20:18,785 --> 02:20:19,706
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1817
02:20:21,347 --> 02:20:23,589
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions from the Council or comments?

1818
02:20:23,609 --> 02:20:31,015
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, we have a number of questions and comments from the public.

1819
02:20:31,076 --> 02:20:34,078
[SPEAKER_37]: So let's see, we have Jennifer Keenan.

1820
02:20:34,679 --> 02:20:36,260
[SPEAKER_37]: If you could please have your name and address for the record.

1821
02:20:37,748 --> 02:20:39,908
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello, Jennifer Keenan, 250 Grove Street.

1822
02:20:40,028 --> 02:20:41,869
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm also the chair of the Historical Commission.

1823
02:20:42,549 --> 02:20:44,489
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you so much for letting me speak on this matter.

1824
02:20:44,509 --> 02:20:45,509
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1825
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:59,752
[SPEAKER_25]: So just to be very clear, our biggest concern are gut rehab demolitions that are being, you know, a permit is being filled out to have, you know, minor renovations done on a property.

1826
02:21:00,332 --> 02:21:06,773
[SPEAKER_25]: And then all of a sudden, they are completely stripped of roof lines, exterior porches,

1827
02:21:07,369 --> 02:21:12,713
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, this is where this kind of clarification stemmed from.

1828
02:21:13,233 --> 02:21:15,855
[SPEAKER_25]: We are not looking to put burdens on homeowners.

1829
02:21:15,895 --> 02:21:20,678
[SPEAKER_25]: We are not looking to prevent somebody from changing windows or door.

1830
02:21:21,538 --> 02:21:24,821
[SPEAKER_25]: We are looking at larger challenges here.

1831
02:21:26,142 --> 02:21:31,085
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, we've lost several properties in the past several years.

1832
02:21:31,690 --> 02:21:42,654
[SPEAKER_25]: because a developer has filled out a permit to be one type of renovation, the permit's been approved, and then all of a sudden the house is stripped bare inside and out.

1833
02:21:43,274 --> 02:21:51,777
[SPEAKER_25]: We are not looking to police, for lack of a better word, interior renovations of any kind.

1834
02:21:52,377 --> 02:21:58,399
[SPEAKER_25]: We are concerned about gut renovations that take away the entire character of a house

1835
02:21:59,264 --> 02:22:07,387
[SPEAKER_25]: that are being slipped through the cracks because they are perpetrated as one type of project and then morph into something else.

1836
02:22:10,408 --> 02:22:11,449
[SPEAKER_41]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1837
02:22:11,849 --> 02:22:13,229
[SPEAKER_41]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1838
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:20,672
[SPEAKER_41]: Would it not be the building department's responsibility to enforce the permits that are pulled and the plans that are approved and not that of the Historical Commission?

1839
02:22:23,593 --> 02:22:27,755
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, but we are not finding that that's happening.

1840
02:22:29,502 --> 02:22:35,404
[SPEAKER_43]: So this is a reactionary response to lack of enforcement as opposed to a necessity?

1841
02:22:36,225 --> 02:22:43,748
[SPEAKER_25]: We were asked for clarification on a demo delay ordinance back in 2018 and we provided the building department with

1842
02:22:44,395 --> 02:22:50,120
[SPEAKER_25]: some clarification on how we feel the ordinance should be interpreted.

1843
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:53,702
[SPEAKER_25]: And we have support from Attorney Scanlon on that as well.

1844
02:22:54,863 --> 02:23:10,656
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's where those quote unquote five bullet points came from, because the actual ordinance is much linear than we have kind of, we've defined it and kind of put some parameters on it that are a little bit more, less restrictive, frankly, than not.

1845
02:23:11,155 --> 02:23:20,397
[SPEAKER_25]: So what happened was it, you know, this, um, the, it came, it's, you know, though we were asked for clarification, we provided it.

1846
02:23:20,957 --> 02:23:25,798
[SPEAKER_25]: And then the, it still wasn't, it still wasn't happening.

1847
02:23:26,198 --> 02:23:32,479
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, properties were being basically stripped down to their core, even with these guidelines in place from 2018.

1848
02:23:32,539 --> 02:23:38,920
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's an enforcement issue.

1849
02:23:41,018 --> 02:23:41,358
[SPEAKER_43]: Correct.

1850
02:23:42,679 --> 02:23:46,161
[SPEAKER_43]: So there really is no need to change the existing protocols.

1851
02:23:46,601 --> 02:23:50,623
[SPEAKER_43]: There is a need to invest in more rigorous enforcement.

1852
02:23:51,864 --> 02:23:52,124
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1853
02:23:52,284 --> 02:23:55,386
[SPEAKER_25]: We're not, we have not changed anything in the ordinance at all.

1854
02:23:55,406 --> 02:23:56,867
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't have the right to.

1855
02:23:57,567 --> 02:23:57,908
[SPEAKER_25]: Correct.

1856
02:23:57,988 --> 02:23:58,368
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course.

1857
02:23:58,968 --> 02:23:59,208
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

1858
02:23:59,388 --> 02:24:06,512
[SPEAKER_25]: And the only change that was made back in 2017, as we all know, was the change from 1900 to 75 years and six months to 18 months.

1859
02:24:10,224 --> 02:24:14,565
[SPEAKER_25]: All of these same kind of parameters have been in place and are still in place.

1860
02:24:15,386 --> 02:24:18,387
[SPEAKER_25]: It is about enforcement and not any sort of change.

1861
02:24:18,407 --> 02:24:22,128
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't know.

1862
02:24:22,168 --> 02:24:28,170
[SPEAKER_43]: That doesn't sound like it really aligns with the legislative intent, Mr. President, when it was passed or amended.

1863
02:24:28,930 --> 02:24:37,773
[SPEAKER_43]: But again, I will let the chips fall where they may and see where this leads us after Mr. Mulkey provides us with his comprehensive report.

1864
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:40,401
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't know.

1865
02:24:41,022 --> 02:24:43,586
[SPEAKER_43]: It gives me a bad taste in my mouth, Mr. President.

1866
02:24:43,626 --> 02:24:49,015
[SPEAKER_43]: It doesn't feel right to me that someone can invest eight, nine million dollars in a home.

1867
02:24:50,140 --> 02:24:54,801
[SPEAKER_43]: and then be bound by so many restrictions and levels of bureaucracy.

1868
02:24:54,821 --> 02:25:03,804
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, especially with all the discussion that we're having about how government operates and the problems that we've seen in Medford relative to its housing and reports that have come out.

1869
02:25:04,464 --> 02:25:07,645
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, I think that sometimes less government is better than more government.

1870
02:25:07,945 --> 02:25:15,287
[SPEAKER_43]: And if in fact, you know, there is this, you know, belief that there's, you know, systemic racism that's going on in Medford,

1871
02:25:15,646 --> 02:25:18,427
[SPEAKER_43]: then maybe we should have less bureaucracy, not more, right?

1872
02:25:18,487 --> 02:25:22,629
[SPEAKER_43]: Because if government's the problem, then why is government gonna be all over everything?

1873
02:25:23,649 --> 02:25:25,950
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case.

1874
02:25:26,010 --> 02:25:27,911
[SPEAKER_43]: I support Councilor Marks' commentary.

1875
02:25:28,331 --> 02:25:30,532
[SPEAKER_43]: And I thank Mr. Moki and Ms.

1876
02:25:30,552 --> 02:25:32,212
[SPEAKER_43]: Kena for being here this evening to explain.

1877
02:25:34,573 --> 02:25:42,936
[SPEAKER_43]: As the legislative body, these things come to us and we're asked what the intent was when it was passed and what are we trying to accomplish?

1878
02:25:45,939 --> 02:25:48,881
[SPEAKER_43]: preserving and restoring historic homes is what we're trying to accomplish.

1879
02:25:49,162 --> 02:25:52,304
[SPEAKER_43]: And if we're not doing that, then we need to take a better how to look at this.

1880
02:25:52,324 --> 02:25:53,165
[SPEAKER_43]: So thank you very much.

1881
02:25:53,185 --> 02:25:53,785
[SPEAKER_43]: I appreciate it.

1882
02:25:53,805 --> 02:25:54,326
[SPEAKER_43]: I rest my case.

1883
02:25:55,366 --> 02:25:56,187
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. President?

1884
02:25:58,169 --> 02:25:58,769
[SPEAKER_52]: Mr. President?

1885
02:25:59,310 --> 02:25:59,550
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

1886
02:25:59,990 --> 02:26:00,510
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, Paul.

1887
02:26:01,331 --> 02:26:05,034
[SPEAKER_52]: Yeah, I just wanted to just make a couple of comments, too.

1888
02:26:05,054 --> 02:26:12,540
[SPEAKER_52]: I think what led to this meeting, as Jennifer was saying, was some of the projects that were going on.

1889
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:14,682
[SPEAKER_52]: But I think that when

1890
02:26:15,805 --> 02:26:17,726
[SPEAKER_52]: My inspector was reviewing the ordinance.

1891
02:26:18,147 --> 02:26:26,793
[SPEAKER_52]: They were looking at the definition, as was mentioned earlier, that was in the ordinance and these bullet points that weren't part of the ordinance.

1892
02:26:27,353 --> 02:26:30,135
[SPEAKER_52]: And that's why it would lead to this meeting to clarify that.

1893
02:26:30,195 --> 02:26:36,019
[SPEAKER_52]: But the enforcement, they were enforcing what they felt was in the ordinance.

1894
02:26:36,199 --> 02:26:41,423
[SPEAKER_52]: And after this meeting that we had about a week and a half ago, we got more clarity on this.

1895
02:26:43,730 --> 02:26:46,572
[SPEAKER_52]: And now that they're moving forward, these are all incorporated in it.

1896
02:26:46,612 --> 02:26:51,736
[SPEAKER_52]: But they were enforcing, again, what they felt was the ordinance, what was on the books.

1897
02:26:51,816 --> 02:26:54,557
[SPEAKER_52]: So I think that just needs to be clarified.

1898
02:26:54,577 --> 02:26:59,401
[SPEAKER_52]: It wasn't that they were trying to be lax in the performance of their duties.

1899
02:26:59,581 --> 02:27:11,569
[SPEAKER_52]: And so now that we have definite clarification in the system put in place moving forward, we have to decide how the specifics of all these items are going to be enforced.

1900
02:27:12,385 --> 02:27:17,229
[SPEAKER_43]: make a mistake, Mr. President, and through to Mr. Mulkey, that this was no criticism on the work that your office does.

1901
02:27:17,409 --> 02:27:20,772
[SPEAKER_43]: Quite frankly, I think you're probably the best run office that we have in the city of Medford.

1902
02:27:21,233 --> 02:27:25,456
[SPEAKER_43]: And quite frankly, you're also overburdened as it is right now.

1903
02:27:25,556 --> 02:27:27,638
[SPEAKER_43]: And like Councilor Mack said, to add another layer of

1904
02:27:28,325 --> 02:27:33,407
[SPEAKER_43]: you know, duties and responsibilities and bureaucracy that you're going to be responsible for, you know, might not make sense.

1905
02:27:33,687 --> 02:27:36,969
[SPEAKER_43]: But I want to be clear that this was no reflection on the job that you do or your office does.

1906
02:27:37,029 --> 02:27:38,629
[SPEAKER_43]: I think you guys do a wonderful job.

1907
02:27:38,669 --> 02:27:44,572
[SPEAKER_43]: And I've always said that you're my favorite department in the city because you guys are unbelievable responsive to the things that come up.

1908
02:27:44,592 --> 02:27:46,993
[SPEAKER_43]: So please, I hope you didn't take that the wrong way.

1909
02:27:47,533 --> 02:27:54,496
[SPEAKER_52]: Well, I appreciate it, but I just didn't want a slight on the, anybody think there was a slight on the inspectors cause they were out there.

1910
02:27:55,188 --> 02:27:56,748
[SPEAKER_52]: enforcing everything that's on the books.

1911
02:27:56,828 --> 02:28:00,490
[SPEAKER_52]: And they're doing, I think, a really good job on doing this field work.

1912
02:28:00,530 --> 02:28:02,370
[SPEAKER_52]: But I just want to clarify that, too.

1913
02:28:05,291 --> 02:28:06,571
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Commissioner Mulkey.

1914
02:28:06,911 --> 02:28:08,472
[SPEAKER_37]: We have, let's see, Vice President Carvial.

1915
02:28:08,492 --> 02:28:10,452
[SPEAKER_37]: There are a number of residents that want to speak.

1916
02:28:11,013 --> 02:28:12,113
[SPEAKER_37]: And we will get to you in one minute.

1917
02:28:12,153 --> 02:28:13,833
[SPEAKER_37]: But we have Vice President Carvial.

1918
02:28:14,193 --> 02:28:14,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1919
02:28:14,774 --> 02:28:15,214
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll be brief.

1920
02:28:16,194 --> 02:28:22,796
[SPEAKER_16]: To the chair, Paul, can you send us what those bullet points are?

1921
02:28:24,736 --> 02:28:26,017
[SPEAKER_16]: at your convenience in this way.

1922
02:28:26,477 --> 02:28:34,761
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe it'd be helpful for the city council to have a committee at the whole meeting with the historic commission to figure out where we're going with this.

1923
02:28:37,103 --> 02:28:38,883
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll offer that in the form of a motion also.

1924
02:28:40,584 --> 02:28:43,446
[SPEAKER_16]: That we meet with the historic commission.

1925
02:28:44,566 --> 02:28:48,048
[SPEAKER_37]: Do you want that to be an amendment to your original motion vice president Cavill?

1926
02:28:48,788 --> 02:28:49,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Mr. President, thank you.

1927
02:28:53,192 --> 02:28:54,473
[SPEAKER_57]: Clerk, do you have that amendment?

1928
02:28:58,995 --> 02:29:00,036
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm working on it, Mr. President.

1929
02:29:00,876 --> 02:29:02,897
[SPEAKER_57]: Is it the historic commission or the historical commission?

1930
02:29:02,917 --> 02:29:06,639
[SPEAKER_16]: We're talking about the historical commission, correct?

1931
02:29:06,659 --> 02:29:08,100
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, thank you.

1932
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:09,400
[SPEAKER_43]: Historic commission, yes.

1933
02:29:09,581 --> 02:29:10,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Historic commission.

1934
02:29:12,040 --> 02:29:19,823
[SPEAKER_16]: And if Mr. Mulkey can send us the bullet points of the new enforcement, it would be helpful to us too.

1935
02:29:19,843 --> 02:29:24,065
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we receive calls from residents, we know what we're talking about.

1936
02:29:25,885 --> 02:29:31,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I myself have received probably about 25 calls from different residents about this.

1937
02:29:34,989 --> 02:29:35,229
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1938
02:29:35,849 --> 02:29:36,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1939
02:29:37,073 --> 02:29:38,274
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Vice President Caravaglio.

1940
02:29:38,334 --> 02:29:40,276
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Artemis, you have the wording for the amendment?

1941
02:29:40,556 --> 02:29:46,501
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, so Vice President Caravaglio's amendment is to the main paper, and we still have the B paper out there as well.

1942
02:29:46,921 --> 02:29:47,361
[SPEAKER_37]: Correct.

1943
02:29:48,062 --> 02:29:52,846
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, let's see, next speaker will be the president, Councilor Marks.

1944
02:29:53,556 --> 02:29:55,738
[SPEAKER_44]: Just if I could quickly, I know a lot of people want to speak.

1945
02:29:55,978 --> 02:29:56,559
[SPEAKER_44]: Absolutely.

1946
02:29:56,979 --> 02:30:02,103
[SPEAKER_44]: If I'm not mistaken, Council Vice President Caviello said to meet with the historic commission.

1947
02:30:03,044 --> 02:30:08,828
[SPEAKER_44]: I have no problem doing that, but it's my understanding this was a directive from the administration.

1948
02:30:09,469 --> 02:30:15,193
[SPEAKER_44]: And I think the best person to have in the room would probably be the city administration as well.

1949
02:30:15,693 --> 02:30:15,954
[SPEAKER_44]: Agreed.

1950
02:30:15,974 --> 02:30:18,416
[SPEAKER_44]: We're going to get to the bottom of this, Mr. President.

1951
02:30:18,716 --> 02:30:21,358
[SPEAKER_44]: We'll have all the so-called players in the room.

1952
02:30:22,332 --> 02:30:22,832
[SPEAKER_44]: Sounds good.

1953
02:30:23,273 --> 02:30:23,633
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fine.

1954
02:30:23,653 --> 02:30:26,535
[SPEAKER_57]: Do you want me to add that?

1955
02:30:28,496 --> 02:30:36,542
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilman, would you like to make an amendment adding basically it would be a member of the administration or do you have someone specific that you'd like to be invited?

1956
02:30:37,362 --> 02:30:39,184
[SPEAKER_55]: Whoever the city administration would like to send.

1957
02:30:39,824 --> 02:30:40,084
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay.

1958
02:30:43,366 --> 02:30:43,667
[SPEAKER_55]: Got it.

1959
02:30:44,867 --> 02:30:45,208
[SPEAKER_55]: Perfect.

1960
02:30:45,808 --> 02:30:46,689
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilman Marks.

1961
02:30:46,709 --> 02:30:48,350
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

1962
02:30:48,990 --> 02:30:49,250
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's see.

1963
02:30:51,957 --> 02:30:52,738
[SPEAKER_38]: Kelly Catalo.

1964
02:30:52,758 --> 02:30:55,380
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record.

1965
02:31:02,746 --> 02:31:04,327
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I got unmuted instead.

1966
02:31:04,728 --> 02:31:08,311
[SPEAKER_62]: Kelly Catalo, 46 Otis Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1967
02:31:08,651 --> 02:31:14,536
[SPEAKER_62]: Mr. President, there are 40 permits that were put on hold two weeks ago in regards to this.

1968
02:31:15,049 --> 02:31:20,431
[SPEAKER_62]: There are approximately 25,000 property owners in the city of Medford that are affected by this.

1969
02:31:21,052 --> 02:31:29,236
[SPEAKER_62]: Paul Mokey has done an exceptional job as the building commissioner, and he should be able to decide who gets a permit and who does not get a permit.

1970
02:31:29,656 --> 02:31:32,477
[SPEAKER_62]: In addition, some of these properties were already demoed.

1971
02:31:32,995 --> 02:31:38,357
[SPEAKER_62]: And this ordinance is asking for a site plan review of what they're going to put there.

1972
02:31:38,837 --> 02:31:41,838
[SPEAKER_62]: What does that matter if the property's already demoed?

1973
02:31:41,918 --> 02:31:45,339
[SPEAKER_62]: How does that affect the historic commission at that point?

1974
02:31:45,899 --> 02:31:51,081
[SPEAKER_62]: So what I would like to ask you to do is to stop and think about everything that's going on with the housing shortage.

1975
02:31:51,401 --> 02:31:55,022
[SPEAKER_62]: The more government regulation that you put on housing,

1976
02:31:55,602 --> 02:32:00,827
[SPEAKER_62]: the less likely that housing is going to be built or that housing is going to be renovated.

1977
02:32:01,247 --> 02:32:09,595
[SPEAKER_62]: People should not have to invest $800,000 into a single family house in Medford and then have to wait a month for the historic commission

1978
02:32:10,014 --> 02:32:14,275
[SPEAKER_62]: to give them an okay because they wanna change the outside of their property.

1979
02:32:14,755 --> 02:32:16,996
[SPEAKER_62]: If we have a historic district, I get it.

1980
02:32:17,456 --> 02:32:20,997
[SPEAKER_62]: I understand not wanting historic properties to be demolitioned.

1981
02:32:21,017 --> 02:32:22,517
[SPEAKER_62]: I am for that.

1982
02:32:22,997 --> 02:32:30,359
[SPEAKER_62]: But to have this go across the board and to shut down housing production for two weeks is not acceptable.

1983
02:32:30,739 --> 02:32:37,801
[SPEAKER_62]: Governor Baker himself said this morning, nobody should be doing anything that's going to hinder housing production.

1984
02:32:38,661 --> 02:32:40,323
[SPEAKER_62]: I'm going to call the elephant out in the room.

1985
02:32:40,683 --> 02:32:47,949
[SPEAKER_62]: There's a property on West Street, and there's a property on Park Street that some people think that they have over exceeded what they should have built on.

1986
02:32:48,370 --> 02:32:50,451
[SPEAKER_62]: If there's a problem, deal with the problem.

1987
02:32:50,532 --> 02:32:53,474
[SPEAKER_62]: Do not hold the entire community responsible for it.

1988
02:32:54,015 --> 02:32:54,435
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you.

1989
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:55,676
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1990
02:32:55,696 --> 02:32:58,939
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's see, we have, oh.

1991
02:33:00,305 --> 02:33:02,387
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Paul Fumble, 33 Douglas.

1992
02:33:02,728 --> 02:33:06,372
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to thank Councilor Marks and Knight for their comments.

1993
02:33:06,432 --> 02:33:07,493
[SPEAKER_23]: I really appreciate them.

1994
02:33:08,574 --> 02:33:14,560
[SPEAKER_23]: I can speak as both a homeowner in Medford and as a small business owner and developer in Medford.

1995
02:33:15,401 --> 02:33:18,625
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm all for maintaining our historic history.

1996
02:33:18,685 --> 02:33:19,385
[SPEAKER_23]: I love history.

1997
02:33:21,127 --> 02:33:24,209
[SPEAKER_23]: But I think it needs to be done in a proactive way.

1998
02:33:24,429 --> 02:33:34,413
[SPEAKER_23]: If we are deciding retroactively, once a permit is submitted, what houses are historic and which houses are not, we're putting a massive burden on the residents.

1999
02:33:36,411 --> 02:33:42,415
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm pretty sure that virtually all of us live in a house built before 1945 if we're living in Medford.

2000
02:33:42,536 --> 02:33:50,161
[SPEAKER_23]: And so suddenly the building commission has a huge second layer on top of it on almost every building project I would imagine in Medford.

2001
02:33:51,542 --> 02:33:56,306
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that just concerns me that extending time and burden on the residents.

2002
02:33:57,186 --> 02:34:02,570
[SPEAKER_23]: I can say that the commissioner's office, Paul Milwaukee and his team, have been phenomenal.

2003
02:34:03,311 --> 02:34:10,296
[SPEAKER_23]: I do not have the ability to submit a permit and then change it without their express approval.

2004
02:34:10,636 --> 02:34:15,139
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's no way that I can submit drawings for one thing and do another.

2005
02:34:15,159 --> 02:34:25,186
[SPEAKER_23]: His inspectors have been on top of everything, reviewing everything we've ever done, and making sure that we've done exactly what we've promised to do.

2006
02:34:26,927 --> 02:34:40,972
[SPEAKER_23]: If we are adding a commission's ability to add, you want to call it six months, you want to call it 18 months, you're adding thousands of dollars per month just to exist in construction.

2007
02:34:41,532 --> 02:34:47,274
[SPEAKER_23]: And if we want to talk about over a year just to exist, that's going to go back to the residents.

2008
02:34:47,754 --> 02:34:51,595
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't afford to hold a project in construction for 18 months.

2009
02:34:51,675 --> 02:34:52,996
[SPEAKER_23]: It just is not possible.

2010
02:34:53,576 --> 02:34:55,297
[SPEAKER_23]: And so as a small business owner, we're small.

2011
02:34:55,337 --> 02:35:01,339
[SPEAKER_23]: And I've restored a couple of houses in Medford and love keeping as much of the historic aspects as we can.

2012
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:04,140
[SPEAKER_23]: But sometimes that's insanely cost prohibitive.

2013
02:35:04,521 --> 02:35:11,644
[SPEAKER_23]: And I have concerns, projects that I've done that the historic commission may not have been happy with.

2014
02:35:12,164 --> 02:35:15,665
[SPEAKER_23]: Quite literally, we had to brace the walls when we started demo.

2015
02:35:15,785 --> 02:35:18,206
[SPEAKER_23]: They would have literally fallen over on themselves.

2016
02:35:18,286 --> 02:35:21,088
[SPEAKER_23]: The houses were in such a horrible condition that

2017
02:35:22,228 --> 02:35:24,189
[SPEAKER_23]: there was not possible to save them.

2018
02:35:25,449 --> 02:35:32,813
[SPEAKER_23]: And so if we're going to retroactively demand that they're, you know, deem them historic, who's going to foot the cost?

2019
02:35:33,853 --> 02:35:39,776
[SPEAKER_23]: The residents, the sellers, the buyers, somewhere along the line, someone's got to foot that bill.

2020
02:35:40,716 --> 02:35:48,139
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, it concerns me that we can do this after permits are submitted, that we can suddenly change the historic stature of a house.

2021
02:35:49,580 --> 02:35:49,800
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2022
02:35:52,088 --> 02:35:56,275
[SPEAKER_41]: Mr. President, being a small business owner that's in this type of world,

2023
02:36:04,093 --> 02:36:10,396
[SPEAKER_43]: What do banks do when you want to get financing for a project and you go into a community that has an 18-month demolition delay?

2024
02:36:10,456 --> 02:36:12,356
[SPEAKER_43]: What's it like to get financing on a project?

2025
02:36:13,917 --> 02:36:15,958
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think they would do it.

2026
02:36:16,118 --> 02:36:19,459
[SPEAKER_23]: If I had an 18-month delay, I don't think I could finance the project.

2027
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:20,700
[SPEAKER_23]: It would be dead in the water.

2028
02:36:21,500 --> 02:36:27,883
[SPEAKER_23]: And the small business and myself, I'd have to go somewhere else, which would, as a resident of Medford, I love restoring houses in Medford.

2029
02:36:27,903 --> 02:36:29,904
[SPEAKER_23]: But if I got slapped with that 18-month delay,

2030
02:36:31,188 --> 02:36:34,529
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd have to walk away, which means our housing crunch still exists.

2031
02:36:34,569 --> 02:36:38,150
[SPEAKER_23]: The houses that we're working on are often not habitable.

2032
02:36:39,130 --> 02:36:45,392
[SPEAKER_23]: The reason that they are getting fully demoed in the interiors is because you do not want residents living in them.

2033
02:36:46,492 --> 02:36:49,313
[SPEAKER_23]: And those are the type of projects that are getting flagged by the historic commission.

2034
02:36:49,793 --> 02:36:57,015
[SPEAKER_23]: They're not something that can be lived in by our residents as rentals, as apartments, or as homeowners.

2035
02:36:58,335 --> 02:37:10,782
[SPEAKER_23]: And so, no, to answer your question, if we have an 18-month burden slapped on developers or homeowners who want to do that, you're going to see home values go down and you're going to see development stagger to a halt.

2036
02:37:11,442 --> 02:37:12,723
[SPEAKER_43]: That's my opinion.

2037
02:37:13,083 --> 02:37:19,126
[SPEAKER_43]: And Mr. President, through you to the gentleman, as a small business owner, can you tell us a little bit about the business you're doing, how many employees you employ?

2038
02:37:20,778 --> 02:37:23,279
[SPEAKER_23]: It's my wife and I are the primary employees.

2039
02:37:24,579 --> 02:37:29,201
[SPEAKER_23]: Our construction team is all families.

2040
02:37:30,601 --> 02:37:34,883
[SPEAKER_23]: Our general contractor team is a husband, wife, and son.

2041
02:37:36,283 --> 02:37:39,584
[SPEAKER_23]: Plumber and electrician are small local operations.

2042
02:37:40,164 --> 02:37:40,925
[SPEAKER_23]: We've been using the same.

2043
02:37:40,945 --> 02:37:43,726
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got almost a family of our own in the small business.

2044
02:37:46,214 --> 02:37:47,836
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm trying to keep them moving.

2045
02:37:48,156 --> 02:37:51,699
[SPEAKER_23]: And so, yeah, as a small business owner, this scares me a lot.

2046
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:59,526
[SPEAKER_23]: For me to operate in Medford, this would be a major blow for my business to stay active in Medford.

2047
02:38:00,427 --> 02:38:11,417
[SPEAKER_43]: And again, Mr. President, through you to the gentleman, so you're saying that you probably create on one gut renovation, 20 jobs, 10 jobs?

2048
02:38:14,632 --> 02:38:16,754
[SPEAKER_43]: Let's see, I was at 15 or more.

2049
02:38:16,774 --> 02:38:18,115
[SPEAKER_43]: 15 or more, okay.

2050
02:38:18,275 --> 02:38:20,436
[SPEAKER_43]: And these jobs all pay a living wage, I would assume?

2051
02:38:21,257 --> 02:38:21,737
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely.

2052
02:38:22,778 --> 02:38:24,819
[SPEAKER_23]: There is good money to be made in all the trades.

2053
02:38:25,159 --> 02:38:27,761
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think we should encourage more of our kids to go that direction.

2054
02:38:28,641 --> 02:38:29,302
[SPEAKER_43]: I wish I did.

2055
02:38:30,683 --> 02:38:31,783
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you very much.

2056
02:38:31,943 --> 02:38:33,364
[SPEAKER_43]: I appreciate you taking the time, sir.

2057
02:38:33,865 --> 02:38:34,145
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2058
02:38:34,585 --> 02:38:35,466
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2059
02:38:35,546 --> 02:38:36,466
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Paul.

2060
02:38:36,506 --> 02:38:38,868
[SPEAKER_37]: Next up is, I believe his last name is Calbee.

2061
02:38:46,492 --> 02:38:46,992
[SPEAKER_32]: Help.

2062
02:38:47,772 --> 02:38:48,492
[SPEAKER_55]: He needs help.

2063
02:38:49,093 --> 02:38:50,513
[SPEAKER_32]: I just unmuted him.

2064
02:38:52,714 --> 02:38:53,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me now?

2065
02:38:54,815 --> 02:38:55,855
[SPEAKER_55]: Name and address for the record.

2066
02:38:56,656 --> 02:38:59,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim Calvi, 208 210 Forest Street, Bedford.

2067
02:39:00,177 --> 02:39:03,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of the builders in town that's directly affected by this.

2068
02:39:03,998 --> 02:39:05,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I applied for a demo permit.

2069
02:39:06,095 --> 02:39:07,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I received the demo permit.

2070
02:39:07,516 --> 02:39:09,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I demoed 208-210 Forest Street.

2071
02:39:10,377 --> 02:39:11,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an absolute wreck.

2072
02:39:12,057 --> 02:39:14,538
[SPEAKER_02]: What's still standing there, you can see, is a wreck.

2073
02:39:15,799 --> 02:39:22,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been denied my building permit because the Historical Society has stepped in and want to review all permits in the city.

2074
02:39:23,582 --> 02:39:24,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now,

2075
02:39:24,912 --> 02:39:26,212
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot do anything.

2076
02:39:26,892 --> 02:39:28,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And I disagree with Mr. Mulkey.

2077
02:39:28,753 --> 02:39:33,174
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to do porch work, if you want to do a roof, they have a say on everything.

2078
02:39:33,214 --> 02:39:34,214
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're trying to get.

2079
02:39:34,754 --> 02:39:36,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've stymied the building process.

2080
02:39:37,595 --> 02:39:44,937
[SPEAKER_02]: And answer to Mr. Knight's question about how many people you employ, it ends up being 20 to 30 people work on these projects.

2081
02:39:44,977 --> 02:39:47,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done about 60 something projects in Medford since 1971.

2082
02:39:50,862 --> 02:40:02,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've generated for the tax base when we take these wrecks, clean them out, sometimes like the previous man said, we have to gut rehab them because they're just deplorable, absolutely deplorable.

2083
02:40:02,851 --> 02:40:03,972
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't put a dog in them.

2084
02:40:04,613 --> 02:40:08,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where this ordinance, I don't know who dreamt it up.

2085
02:40:08,956 --> 02:40:13,920
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's stymie in development, it's stymie in housing and everybody's screaming for more housing.

2086
02:40:14,061 --> 02:40:21,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope the council and their infinite wisdom will change it around in a hurry because it stopped everything in Medford right now.

2087
02:40:21,727 --> 02:40:22,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2088
02:40:23,309 --> 02:40:23,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2089
02:40:23,729 --> 02:40:25,771
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's see.

2090
02:40:25,971 --> 02:40:31,296
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh, we have, um, Cheryl, Cheryl, can you please give us your name and address for the record?

2091
02:40:35,399 --> 02:40:36,280
[SPEAKER_56]: We just hear from Cheryl.

2092
02:40:37,188 --> 02:40:39,069
[SPEAKER_37]: You know what, I unmuted two people at once.

2093
02:40:39,169 --> 02:40:40,590
[SPEAKER_37]: It was a Cheryl and Will.

2094
02:40:40,650 --> 02:40:44,071
[SPEAKER_37]: I unmuted you by accident, but you can hang on.

2095
02:40:44,531 --> 02:40:44,831
[SPEAKER_56]: I'll wait.

2096
02:40:45,452 --> 02:40:47,212
[SPEAKER_37]: If you just get Cheryl first.

2097
02:40:50,334 --> 02:40:52,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I believe that's me.

2098
02:40:52,174 --> 02:40:52,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I already spoke.

2099
02:40:53,195 --> 02:40:53,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

2100
02:40:54,135 --> 02:40:55,036
[SPEAKER_37]: No worries.

2101
02:40:55,096 --> 02:40:55,476
[SPEAKER_35]: No worries.

2102
02:40:55,576 --> 02:40:56,596
[SPEAKER_35]: OK, Will, you're on.

2103
02:40:56,616 --> 02:40:57,937
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record.

2104
02:40:59,077 --> 02:41:01,499
[SPEAKER_56]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

2105
02:41:03,251 --> 02:41:06,594
[SPEAKER_56]: I really share a lot of the concerns that a lot of people have already said.

2106
02:41:06,614 --> 02:41:18,062
[SPEAKER_56]: I agree strongly with with with Councillor Knight's concern about how this is basically the government interfering with our productivity and the government, I think, has a lot of important roles.

2107
02:41:18,562 --> 02:41:23,366
[SPEAKER_56]: rules that will facilitate our cooperation and achieving common goals and that'll make us all richer.

2108
02:41:23,746 --> 02:41:25,007
[SPEAKER_56]: That's what government is for.

2109
02:41:25,027 --> 02:41:30,391
[SPEAKER_56]: But right now, I'm worried that it's getting in the way of our productivity with this.

2110
02:41:30,791 --> 02:41:34,214
[SPEAKER_56]: It's preventing it so that the housing can't be built.

2111
02:41:34,674 --> 02:41:36,195
[SPEAKER_56]: We have the people that are ready to build.

2112
02:41:36,215 --> 02:41:40,098
[SPEAKER_56]: You have the housing, you have the spots to build it.

2113
02:41:41,139 --> 02:41:41,839
[SPEAKER_56]: All ready to go.

2114
02:41:41,899 --> 02:41:44,922
[SPEAKER_56]: People are going to be barging to move in once it's done.

2115
02:41:46,254 --> 02:41:47,234
[SPEAKER_56]: Let's let it happen.

2116
02:41:47,695 --> 02:41:50,596
[SPEAKER_56]: Now, I understand if something is legitimately historic.

2117
02:41:50,656 --> 02:41:52,257
[SPEAKER_56]: I agree with somebody's suggestion.

2118
02:41:52,297 --> 02:41:56,018
[SPEAKER_56]: Maybe let's go through and mark things historic in advance, sort of flag them.

2119
02:41:56,038 --> 02:41:57,699
[SPEAKER_56]: That way people know what they're getting into.

2120
02:41:58,179 --> 02:42:02,361
[SPEAKER_56]: They're not scared to take on a project investing in our community.

2121
02:42:03,678 --> 02:42:07,801
[SPEAKER_56]: I just want to point out, this quite relates to my land value tax argument.

2122
02:42:08,301 --> 02:42:12,703
[SPEAKER_56]: This burden occurs when you want to do something productive.

2123
02:42:12,724 --> 02:42:15,445
[SPEAKER_56]: It could be a productive member of society.

2124
02:42:16,066 --> 02:42:26,092
[SPEAKER_56]: I don't think that if you buy a historic house and just let it rot and go to waste so that you can eventually build there later, you don't have to do any, you know,

2125
02:42:26,932 --> 02:42:28,132
[SPEAKER_56]: You have to do a permit for that.

2126
02:42:28,473 --> 02:42:30,994
[SPEAKER_56]: But if you want to do something productive, you do got to get a permit.

2127
02:42:31,234 --> 02:42:33,194
[SPEAKER_56]: And there are cases where the permit is legit.

2128
02:42:33,575 --> 02:42:42,338
[SPEAKER_56]: But we got to be careful with that because it will prevent us achieving our goals as a city if it gets too crazy.

2129
02:42:43,018 --> 02:42:43,358
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

2130
02:42:43,378 --> 02:42:46,740
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2131
02:42:46,880 --> 02:42:48,000
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments?

2132
02:42:50,921 --> 02:42:54,883
[SPEAKER_33]: One minute.

2133
02:43:09,171 --> 02:43:10,491
[SPEAKER_38]: Cheryl, name and address for the record.

2134
02:43:12,432 --> 02:43:15,072
[SPEAKER_63]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

2135
02:43:17,433 --> 02:43:23,214
[SPEAKER_63]: So, I'm listening to the demo delay seems to be a little bit misunderstood here.

2136
02:43:23,254 --> 02:43:24,315
[SPEAKER_63]: The delay is at most 18 months.

2137
02:43:26,581 --> 02:43:29,422
[SPEAKER_63]: Flipper that already spoke bought a house that was falling down.

2138
02:43:29,723 --> 02:43:32,564
[SPEAKER_63]: His delay would not last anywhere near 18 months.

2139
02:43:33,044 --> 02:43:35,385
[SPEAKER_63]: He would be released and allowed to demo and build.

2140
02:43:36,486 --> 02:43:40,187
[SPEAKER_63]: This is about bigger projects and projects that are slipping under the radar.

2141
02:43:40,328 --> 02:43:51,033
[SPEAKER_63]: And I have spoken to Paul Moki about 277 Park Street, probably five, six times, because this is a Flipper in our community who knows where all the loopholes are.

2142
02:43:51,173 --> 02:43:55,855
[SPEAKER_63]: And I hear when I go to the building office that he's a nice guy and he's not a nice guy.

2143
02:43:56,414 --> 02:44:02,317
[SPEAKER_63]: He will get a permit for an interior non-structural demo so that he won't trigger any oversight.

2144
02:44:02,797 --> 02:44:04,518
[SPEAKER_63]: And then he'll tear off the siding.

2145
02:44:04,578 --> 02:44:06,879
[SPEAKER_63]: He'll sledgehammer the porches into the street.

2146
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:10,861
[SPEAKER_63]: And if no one calls, he continues to work.

2147
02:44:11,322 --> 02:44:21,087
[SPEAKER_63]: So the person that lives next door or on the street has to keep calling every time he does something unsafe or outside his permit to get someone to come down and check on him.

2148
02:44:21,787 --> 02:44:28,753
[SPEAKER_63]: So maybe you need more inspectors, or maybe you need someone else to look at these plans before these projects are approved.

2149
02:44:29,313 --> 02:44:31,875
[SPEAKER_63]: He demoed a porch, which he wasn't allowed to demo.

2150
02:44:32,095 --> 02:44:33,516
[SPEAKER_63]: They called it an accident.

2151
02:44:33,957 --> 02:44:35,658
[SPEAKER_63]: He was supposed to restore the porch.

2152
02:44:35,998 --> 02:44:37,400
[SPEAKER_63]: Instead, he built a new room.

2153
02:44:37,820 --> 02:44:42,243
[SPEAKER_63]: Another violation of his plans, a violation of the historic commission rules,

2154
02:44:43,184 --> 02:44:45,566
[SPEAKER_63]: And the penalty was he was shut down for 24 hours.

2155
02:44:45,626 --> 02:44:47,849
[SPEAKER_63]: And I believe he got $1,000 fine.

2156
02:44:48,429 --> 02:44:50,331
[SPEAKER_63]: So they know what they can get away with.

2157
02:44:50,571 --> 02:44:51,612
[SPEAKER_63]: And they carry on.

2158
02:44:52,473 --> 02:45:01,321
[SPEAKER_63]: And what they're doing is they're taking moderate price housing, the house next door works to 1000 square foot apartments.

2159
02:45:01,881 --> 02:45:08,868
[SPEAKER_63]: The house costs $600,000 was livable had to working class families living in it.

2160
02:45:09,288 --> 02:45:18,393
[SPEAKER_63]: He is now flipping it into two 2,500 square foot homes that he'll sell for $800,000 to $900,000 each.

2161
02:45:18,833 --> 02:45:20,454
[SPEAKER_63]: So this is gentrification.

2162
02:45:20,474 --> 02:45:23,495
[SPEAKER_63]: This is not talking about end users.

2163
02:45:23,836 --> 02:45:29,979
[SPEAKER_63]: These are not residents buying homes and trying to change windows, porches, or decks.

2164
02:45:30,879 --> 02:45:34,761
[SPEAKER_63]: This is really a last ditch effort of people saying, help us.

2165
02:45:35,281 --> 02:45:37,902
[SPEAKER_63]: City Council, can you work on the zoning?

2166
02:45:38,002 --> 02:45:40,023
[SPEAKER_63]: Can you stop the gentrification?

2167
02:45:40,463 --> 02:45:47,206
[SPEAKER_63]: You're pushing people out, the people in this community that we say we care about, the low income,

2168
02:45:47,588 --> 02:45:54,491
[SPEAKER_63]: The minority demographic are being pushed out of our neighborhoods and we're not doing anything to stop it.

2169
02:45:54,951 --> 02:46:05,715
[SPEAKER_63]: Somerville stopped us from being able to buy and moderately priced to family and converted into condos because it was pushing out residents.

2170
02:46:09,966 --> 02:46:13,569
[SPEAKER_43]: This isn't necessarily particularly about one project, the Park Street project, number one.

2171
02:46:13,589 --> 02:46:19,173
[SPEAKER_43]: Number two, Somerville also wants to charge a person that's selling their home, I think, a 2% surcharge to move out of the community.

2172
02:46:19,193 --> 02:46:25,917
[SPEAKER_43]: So if we're using Somerville as a reference point as to what to do here in Medford, I think we're really going to be in big trouble.

2173
02:46:26,938 --> 02:46:30,901
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I appreciate the speaker, but I did want to clarify that.

2174
02:46:31,561 --> 02:46:35,364
[SPEAKER_43]: Some of the methodologies that they practice in the city of Somerville come from outer space.

2175
02:46:37,165 --> 02:46:37,966
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Councilman.

2176
02:46:39,545 --> 02:46:46,170
[SPEAKER_63]: Absolutely, and a lot of the practices that we do in Medford are just reactionary because we refuse to act before it gets too late.

2177
02:46:46,670 --> 02:46:54,195
[SPEAKER_63]: And the Nelson Properties owns at least a dozen homes in this community and is replicating these activities across the community.

2178
02:46:54,315 --> 02:47:04,222
[SPEAKER_63]: There's also one on Court Street on a parcel that's probably two thirds the size of the house next door to me going up, but the new house is the same size.

2179
02:47:04,362 --> 02:47:08,225
[SPEAKER_63]: I'm really concerned that the lot coverage rules are not being adhered to.

2180
02:47:09,307 --> 02:47:11,708
[SPEAKER_63]: And this is something that you need to look at.

2181
02:47:12,048 --> 02:47:14,768
[SPEAKER_63]: But yes, Somerville did stop condoization.

2182
02:47:15,268 --> 02:47:19,769
[SPEAKER_63]: Articles are being written that say, come to Medford, buy the two families.

2183
02:47:20,130 --> 02:47:22,170
[SPEAKER_63]: They will not stop you from condoizing.

2184
02:47:22,510 --> 02:47:25,071
[SPEAKER_63]: You can easily gentrify and make lots of money.

2185
02:47:25,171 --> 02:47:26,451
[SPEAKER_63]: And that's why people are here.

2186
02:47:27,351 --> 02:47:30,252
[SPEAKER_63]: If we care about housing, we want end users and not just

2187
02:47:31,528 --> 02:47:38,812
[SPEAKER_63]: high wage end users, the man next door told me these would be quality people because these units would be very expensive.

2188
02:47:38,972 --> 02:47:42,054
[SPEAKER_63]: And I would say that that is disgusting.

2189
02:47:42,194 --> 02:47:43,615
[SPEAKER_63]: And that's not what we should want.

2190
02:47:43,995 --> 02:47:48,697
[SPEAKER_63]: Only people that make high wages are not the only high quality people.

2191
02:47:48,838 --> 02:47:49,638
[SPEAKER_63]: So help us.

2192
02:47:50,458 --> 02:47:53,020
[SPEAKER_63]: Please do something on zoning before it's too late.

2193
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:56,862
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you to the historic commission for trying.

2194
02:48:00,316 --> 02:48:03,038
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, next we have Sam Collins.

2195
02:48:04,018 --> 02:48:05,379
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, Sam.

2196
02:48:06,220 --> 02:48:08,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam Collins, Arlington Street, Medford.

2197
02:48:08,561 --> 02:48:11,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I can't join by video tonight, and thanks everybody for your time.

2198
02:48:11,483 --> 02:48:14,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I 100% agree with Cheryl.

2199
02:48:15,066 --> 02:48:20,149
[SPEAKER_08]: This city has a reputation, I'm in construction 20, I don't know, 20 something years now.

2200
02:48:21,210 --> 02:48:22,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I am in residential now.

2201
02:48:23,071 --> 02:48:24,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford has a reputation for

2202
02:48:25,620 --> 02:48:30,929
[SPEAKER_08]: doing nothing against aggressive contractors and not requiring really any demands of them.

2203
02:48:31,009 --> 02:48:33,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Nelson in particular is brutal around here.

2204
02:48:33,533 --> 02:48:35,275
[SPEAKER_08]: And in my opinion, he has to be stopped.

2205
02:48:35,295 --> 02:48:38,180
[SPEAKER_08]: He is trashing my block and our neighborhood.

2206
02:48:38,632 --> 02:48:42,095
[SPEAKER_08]: but I'm not gonna take the council's and everybody's time with that tonight.

2207
02:48:43,336 --> 02:48:54,164
[SPEAKER_08]: The aggressive contractors have to be put in check, the flippers, and we need to develop a reputation for preserving houses and homes for our most at-risk residents.

2208
02:48:54,765 --> 02:48:57,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I'm totally in agreement with everything Cheryl said.

2209
02:48:58,688 --> 02:49:03,051
[SPEAKER_08]: With that being said, with the demo delay, I agree that's being misinterpreted.

2210
02:49:03,671 --> 02:49:06,914
[SPEAKER_08]: You really won't have a problem if you have a hardship, as I understand it.

2211
02:49:07,464 --> 02:49:12,027
[SPEAKER_08]: We do need more inspectors and somebody to really push the enforcement.

2212
02:49:12,067 --> 02:49:13,408
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't an enforcement issue.

2213
02:49:14,449 --> 02:49:15,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight is correct.

2214
02:49:15,309 --> 02:49:21,133
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an enforcement issue, but it's not happening for whatever reason, and at least Historic is trying.

2215
02:49:21,173 --> 02:49:22,894
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate everybody's time.

2216
02:49:22,934 --> 02:49:23,755
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I have to say.

2217
02:49:24,215 --> 02:49:25,116
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you very much.

2218
02:49:25,136 --> 02:49:31,880
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, up next is we have Jennifer Keenan.

2219
02:49:37,577 --> 02:49:39,338
[SPEAKER_27]: I think you unmuted the wrong Jennifer.

2220
02:49:40,179 --> 02:49:42,421
[SPEAKER_33]: Sorry.

2221
02:49:43,081 --> 02:49:44,182
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, President Falco.

2222
02:49:44,222 --> 02:49:47,325
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, 250 Grove Street, chair of the Medford Historical Commission.

2223
02:49:47,785 --> 02:49:51,268
[SPEAKER_25]: I look forward to continuing this conversation in a committee of the whole meeting.

2224
02:49:51,288 --> 02:49:54,450
[SPEAKER_25]: I just would like to make a couple of final points on this matter.

2225
02:49:55,431 --> 02:50:02,997
[SPEAKER_25]: First and foremost, we have no intention of dragging out any sort of review past the normal 30 day process that

2226
02:50:03,507 --> 02:50:08,751
[SPEAKER_25]: Anybody that applies for a building permit, that's how long the building department has to get back to them.

2227
02:50:09,251 --> 02:50:16,376
[SPEAKER_25]: So we are prepared to turn these around within 30 days so that there is zero delay to the person applying for the permit.

2228
02:50:16,997 --> 02:50:21,460
[SPEAKER_25]: Secondly, we did not ask for any permits to be stopped issuing.

2229
02:50:22,400 --> 02:50:23,641
[SPEAKER_25]: that did not come from us.

2230
02:50:24,062 --> 02:50:32,028
[SPEAKER_25]: That was a decision that the commissioner made that he felt was in the best interest of his department in order to get a handle on the situation.

2231
02:50:32,328 --> 02:50:36,592
[SPEAKER_25]: We've had extremely positive and productive calls.

2232
02:50:36,892 --> 02:50:44,218
[SPEAKER_25]: We've spoken almost every day in the past 10 days, and we are committed as a group to work this out for the better of the city.

2233
02:50:45,218 --> 02:50:58,406
[SPEAKER_25]: I have flagged potentially 10 addresses at most for Mr. Moki to look at and just to ask for bigger clarification on so that they can either come before us or not.

2234
02:50:58,806 --> 02:51:03,469
[SPEAKER_25]: We have had one demo case in the past six months come before our board.

2235
02:51:04,109 --> 02:51:04,289
[SPEAKER_25]: One.

2236
02:51:05,150 --> 02:51:07,471
[SPEAKER_25]: And how many projects have taken place

2237
02:51:08,129 --> 02:51:08,989
[SPEAKER_25]: during that time.

2238
02:51:09,550 --> 02:51:23,275
[SPEAKER_25]: And just finally, President Falco, I did send you our letter earlier today that outlines some exact cases and the 2018 memorandum that we had given to the building commissioner at that time.

2239
02:51:23,735 --> 02:51:27,697
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would please, of course, circulate that to the rest of the council.

2240
02:51:28,457 --> 02:51:32,959
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, look forward to continuing the conversation in the committee meeting.

2241
02:51:33,019 --> 02:51:33,739
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

2242
02:51:34,417 --> 02:51:35,498
[SPEAKER_37]: Jennifer, thank you for sending that.

2243
02:51:35,598 --> 02:51:38,701
[SPEAKER_37]: I haven't had a chance to check email since probably this morning.

2244
02:51:38,762 --> 02:51:44,067
[SPEAKER_37]: So what I'll do is I will make sure that I circulate a copy of that to the console so they can see that.

2245
02:51:44,167 --> 02:51:46,289
[SPEAKER_37]: But thank you for sending that along.

2246
02:51:46,970 --> 02:51:48,051
[SPEAKER_37]: We appreciate your comments.

2247
02:51:48,412 --> 02:51:51,555
[SPEAKER_37]: And now I'd like to, I believe Jennifer Crowwood.

2248
02:51:55,270 --> 02:51:57,452
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, Jennifer Kerwin, 43 Willis Avenue.

2249
02:51:57,472 --> 02:51:59,233
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for letting me speak.

2250
02:52:00,074 --> 02:52:05,057
[SPEAKER_27]: I would like to say that I agree with Sam and Cheryl, and I appreciate Jennifer.

2251
02:52:07,559 --> 02:52:16,486
[SPEAKER_27]: I personally have cringed while walking down Manning Street and South Street at the little yellow doll houses, as I call them.

2252
02:52:16,966 --> 02:52:22,170
[SPEAKER_27]: It seems like our desire for housing is sort of

2253
02:52:25,455 --> 02:52:35,739
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, while I completely understand it, I feel like there is something to be said for having historic homes and keeping sort of a personality to the neighborhood.

2254
02:52:36,439 --> 02:52:42,442
[SPEAKER_27]: I do understand that people are afraid of restrictions and regulations, but you can work with them.

2255
02:52:42,602 --> 02:52:44,502
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think that that's really possible.

2256
02:52:45,223 --> 02:52:49,224
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think that people need to familiarize themselves with what these,

2257
02:52:51,570 --> 02:52:58,855
[SPEAKER_27]: regulations actually entail and that we shouldn't be afraid of what we, you know, what we don't know about.

2258
02:52:59,036 --> 02:53:04,780
[SPEAKER_27]: It seems like people didn't fully understand what is involved and I think that that needs to be addressed.

2259
02:53:06,681 --> 02:53:07,021
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2260
02:53:07,522 --> 02:53:13,406
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2261
02:53:13,446 --> 02:53:14,287
[SPEAKER_32]: Next up is

2262
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:20,521
[SPEAKER_35]: I believe Dave McKillop is on the line.

2263
02:53:20,621 --> 02:53:21,342
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, there he is.

2264
02:53:25,605 --> 02:53:26,586
[SPEAKER_38]: Dave, I'm trying to unmute you.

2265
02:53:26,606 --> 02:53:27,907
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record, please.

2266
02:53:32,651 --> 02:53:33,471
[SPEAKER_55]: Dave, we can't hear you.

2267
02:53:46,201 --> 02:53:46,942
[SPEAKER_38]: I can't hear you still.

2268
02:53:47,807 --> 02:53:48,947
[SPEAKER_38]: Let me try, let me try again.

2269
02:53:48,967 --> 02:53:52,589
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, you're unmuted.

2270
02:53:52,649 --> 02:53:53,289
[SPEAKER_38]: Can you try again?

2271
02:53:57,051 --> 02:53:58,191
[SPEAKER_38]: We still can't hear you, Dave.

2272
02:54:00,192 --> 02:54:00,732
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm sorry.

2273
02:54:00,752 --> 02:54:08,715
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, let's see.

2274
02:54:09,375 --> 02:54:11,376
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments from the public?

2275
02:54:17,216 --> 02:54:18,556
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, hearing and seeing none.

2276
02:54:21,977 --> 02:54:28,098
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Arnabis, can you read off the, I believe there are a number of resolutions or there's definitely a B paper and a resolution.

2277
02:54:28,138 --> 02:54:28,899
[SPEAKER_37]: Can you name up that?

2278
02:54:28,999 --> 02:54:30,999
[SPEAKER_37]: Can you actually read the B paper back?

2279
02:54:31,539 --> 02:54:33,480
[SPEAKER_57]: The B paper is from Councilor Knight.

2280
02:54:34,880 --> 02:54:43,602
[SPEAKER_57]: He's requesting an answer to the question, since amending the demolition delay ordinance, how many homes have been saved and restored to a historic state?

2281
02:54:45,848 --> 02:54:47,189
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay, do we have a second on the record?

2282
02:54:47,429 --> 02:54:50,810
[SPEAKER_43]: How many homes that were subject to demolition delay were restored?

2283
02:54:52,090 --> 02:54:53,891
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay, how many homes were subject to demolition?

2284
02:54:58,153 --> 02:54:59,553
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll second that motion, Mr. President.

2285
02:54:59,573 --> 02:55:01,574
[SPEAKER_36]: Seconded by Vice President Caviello.

2286
02:55:01,794 --> 02:55:03,735
[SPEAKER_36]: Clerk, please call the roll.

2287
02:55:12,598 --> 02:55:14,919
[SPEAKER_57]: On the B paper, Councilor Behrs,

2288
02:55:15,831 --> 02:55:16,071
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2289
02:55:17,032 --> 02:55:17,933
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Caraballo.

2290
02:55:18,293 --> 02:55:18,513
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2291
02:55:19,013 --> 02:55:19,514
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight.

2292
02:55:20,835 --> 02:55:21,075
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2293
02:55:21,595 --> 02:55:22,136
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks.

2294
02:55:22,656 --> 02:55:22,976
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2295
02:55:23,597 --> 02:55:24,197
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell.

2296
02:55:24,818 --> 02:55:25,098
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2297
02:55:25,578 --> 02:55:26,359
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2298
02:55:27,320 --> 02:55:27,580
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2299
02:55:28,540 --> 02:55:29,341
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco.

2300
02:55:29,741 --> 02:55:29,961
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

2301
02:55:30,001 --> 02:55:32,503
[SPEAKER_37]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2302
02:55:32,523 --> 02:55:38,148
[SPEAKER_37]: It was a main motion, I believe it was offered by Vice President Caraballo and amended by Vice President Caraballo.

2303
02:55:38,188 --> 02:55:41,270
[SPEAKER_37]: Were there any other amendments to that motion?

2304
02:55:42,056 --> 02:55:45,897
[SPEAKER_57]: There was a clarification to Vice President Caraballo's amendment.

2305
02:55:47,217 --> 02:55:56,380
[SPEAKER_57]: Council Marks, in addition to the Committee of the Whole meeting with the Historical Commission, also wanted someone from the administration to be invited to that Committee of the Whole meeting.

2306
02:55:58,140 --> 02:55:58,741
[SPEAKER_16]: That is correct.

2307
02:55:59,381 --> 02:56:06,483
[SPEAKER_16]: And Mr. Clerk, if you can make sure that the power for the Building Commissioner to send us all the bullet points.

2308
02:56:06,923 --> 02:56:09,763
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, the bullet points on the new procedures.

2309
02:56:12,090 --> 02:56:12,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2310
02:56:12,330 --> 02:56:20,977
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so that's the other resolution by Vice President Caviello as amended by Vice President Caviello and amended by Councilor Marks.

2311
02:56:23,339 --> 02:56:30,544
[SPEAKER_37]: And seconded by... Does anybody wanna second the resolution?

2312
02:56:31,705 --> 02:56:32,026
[SPEAKER_49]: Second.

2313
02:56:32,726 --> 02:56:34,027
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2314
02:56:34,067 --> 02:56:35,328
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk, please call the roll.

02:56:36,389 --> 02:56:37,030
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs.

2316
02:56:38,030 --> 02:56:38,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2317
02:56:39,124 --> 02:56:40,044
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Carabiello?

2318
02:56:40,365 --> 02:56:40,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2319
02:56:41,125 --> 02:56:41,645
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

2320
02:56:41,985 --> 02:56:42,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2321
02:56:42,766 --> 02:56:43,326
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks?

2322
02:56:43,886 --> 02:56:44,207
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2323
02:56:44,847 --> 02:56:45,447
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell?

2324
02:56:46,048 --> 02:56:46,308
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2325
02:56:46,848 --> 02:56:47,628
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2326
02:56:48,629 --> 02:56:48,889
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

2327
02:56:49,389 --> 02:56:50,150
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco?

2328
02:56:50,610 --> 02:56:50,870
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

2329
02:56:50,930 --> 02:56:52,711
[SPEAKER_37]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2330
02:56:52,871 --> 02:56:53,872
[SPEAKER_37]: The motion passes.

2331
02:56:55,032 --> 02:57:00,115
[SPEAKER_52]: Mr. President, could I get a minute to put a little point of information, please?

2332
02:57:00,975 --> 02:57:02,176
[SPEAKER_52]: Yes.

2333
02:57:02,736 --> 02:57:03,616
[SPEAKER_52]: Just one minute quickly.

2334
02:57:03,637 --> 02:57:06,478
[SPEAKER_52]: I'd like to respond to some of the comments that some of those people made.

2335
02:57:07,313 --> 02:57:08,494
[SPEAKER_52]: that was simply not true.

2336
02:57:10,155 --> 02:57:15,379
[SPEAKER_52]: As everyone in the council knows, our office last year alone issued over 2,200 permits.

2337
02:57:16,259 --> 02:57:21,823
[SPEAKER_52]: And we'd like to be out to the sites more often, but we can't get to everywhere in the city every day.

2338
02:57:22,744 --> 02:57:26,427
[SPEAKER_52]: The question about what coverage, not being compliant, that's absolutely false.

2339
02:57:26,567 --> 02:57:32,591
[SPEAKER_52]: Anybody that has any questions is more than welcome to come in or go online to our new permit online software.

2340
02:57:33,106 --> 02:57:34,868
[SPEAKER_52]: and you can take a look at the plans yourself.

2341
02:57:34,908 --> 02:57:39,152
[SPEAKER_52]: And that particular individual with the lot coverage, that's not true and she knows it.

2342
02:57:39,212 --> 02:57:40,733
[SPEAKER_52]: It's been pointed out several times.

2343
02:57:41,334 --> 02:57:45,918
[SPEAKER_52]: And as far as a comment, the other gentleman may be lax on contractors.

2344
02:57:46,699 --> 02:57:52,524
[SPEAKER_52]: Again, the court enforcement every year issues many fines, as many court cases and hearings they have.

2345
02:57:53,325 --> 02:57:56,929
[SPEAKER_52]: And if you think we're just looking the other way or we're not enforcing

2346
02:57:57,874 --> 02:58:00,817
[SPEAKER_52]: These so-called bad contractors, we're not enforcing the law with them.

2347
02:58:00,917 --> 02:58:03,879
[SPEAKER_52]: We enforce the law equally, whether they're a good guy or a bad guy.

2348
02:58:04,380 --> 02:58:06,121
[SPEAKER_52]: And so some of those statements are not true.

2349
02:58:06,181 --> 02:58:16,990
[SPEAKER_52]: And it's not fair to my department, who is all over the place every day and on weekends, and we're called out by the fire department to imply that they're just not going after bad contractors.

2350
02:58:17,010 --> 02:58:17,731
[SPEAKER_52]: That's not true.

2351
02:58:18,712 --> 02:58:24,076
[SPEAKER_52]: I know I'm preaching to the choir here when I'm saying that to the council, but I just really needed to respond to those comments.

2352
02:58:24,196 --> 02:58:26,078
[SPEAKER_52]: And I appreciate you giving me the time to say that.

2353
02:58:26,752 --> 02:58:27,653
[SPEAKER_37]: Paul, thank you very much.

2354
02:58:27,893 --> 02:58:30,696
[SPEAKER_37]: I appreciate it.

2355
02:58:31,477 --> 02:58:41,167
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Harnaby, so before, actually, I think before we started the last resolution, did you say that we had, was it Mr. Jankowski on the line?

2356
02:58:42,728 --> 02:58:43,549
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, that's correct.

2357
02:58:44,650 --> 02:58:45,531
[SPEAKER_42]: Is he still on the line?

2358
02:58:45,551 --> 02:58:47,974
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to take the national grid permits from the table, Mr. President.

2359
02:58:49,652 --> 02:58:51,053
[SPEAKER_57]: You want to suspend the rules, Councilor Knight?

2360
02:58:51,593 --> 02:58:52,894
[SPEAKER_57]: Hang on, we'll just make sure he's still there.

2361
02:58:53,154 --> 02:58:53,754
[SPEAKER_57]: He's still on.

2362
02:58:54,574 --> 02:59:00,217
[SPEAKER_37]: OK, on the motion of Councilor Knight to suspend the rules to take the two national code of permits, seconded by?

2363
02:59:00,577 --> 02:59:00,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

2364
02:59:01,318 --> 02:59:03,419
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Carabiello, Clerk, please call the roll.

2365
02:59:08,121 --> 02:59:08,701
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs?

2366
02:59:09,561 --> 02:59:09,802
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2367
02:59:10,342 --> 02:59:11,262
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Carabiello?

2368
02:59:11,642 --> 02:59:11,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2369
02:59:12,643 --> 02:59:13,143
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

2370
02:59:13,583 --> 02:59:13,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2371
02:59:14,644 --> 02:59:15,184
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks?

2372
02:59:15,664 --> 02:59:15,964
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2373
02:59:16,405 --> 02:59:17,045
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell?

2374
02:59:17,665 --> 02:59:17,985
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2375
02:59:18,346 --> 02:59:19,086
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2376
02:59:20,151 --> 02:59:20,371
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2377
02:59:20,891 --> 02:59:21,572
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco.

2378
02:59:22,272 --> 02:59:23,392
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

2379
02:59:23,412 --> 02:59:24,513
[SPEAKER_37]: 70 affirmative, 0 negative.

2380
02:59:24,533 --> 02:59:25,413
[SPEAKER_37]: The motion passes.

2381
02:59:27,314 --> 02:59:29,255
[SPEAKER_37]: Quickly, if I may, was that 20-479 and 20-480?

2382
02:59:29,275 --> 02:59:30,495
[SPEAKER_37]: I believe that's correct.

2383
02:59:30,535 --> 02:59:31,856
[SPEAKER_37]: Hang on just a second.

2384
02:59:51,500 --> 02:59:52,000
[SPEAKER_57]: 479 and 480, yes.

2385
02:59:52,020 --> 02:59:54,001
[SPEAKER_57]: All right, OK.

2386
02:59:54,861 --> 02:59:58,582
[SPEAKER_37]: Notice of a public hearing, 20-479, legal notice.

2387
02:59:58,642 --> 03:00:06,904
[SPEAKER_37]: Petition for grant of location National Grid of North Andover, Massachusetts and Verizon New England Incorporated, Memphis, Massachusetts City Clerk's Office.

2388
03:00:07,484 --> 03:00:14,106
[SPEAKER_37]: You are hereby notified that by order of the Memphis City Council, public hearing will be given via Zoom at 7 PM on Tuesday.

2389
03:00:14,650 --> 03:00:33,164
[SPEAKER_37]: July 28, 2020, and a joint petition of National Grid Incorporated and Verizon New England Incorporated for permission to locate poles, wires, and fixtures, including the necessary sustaining and protecting fixtures along and across the public way hereafter named to be located substantially in accordance with the plan, marked 295-678.

2390
03:00:33,705 --> 03:00:37,648
[SPEAKER_42]: My information, Mr. President, I do believe you read this once already.

2391
03:00:37,688 --> 03:00:38,668
[SPEAKER_42]: We've just taken it off the table.

2392
03:00:38,708 --> 03:00:40,790
[SPEAKER_42]: I think we can go right into the presentation, if I'm not mistaken.

2393
03:00:42,146 --> 03:00:44,988
[SPEAKER_37]: You actually are correct, this is the one I did read, so I apologize.

2394
03:00:45,008 --> 03:00:47,190
[SPEAKER_37]: We can save ourselves a little bit of time.

2395
03:00:48,230 --> 03:00:53,594
[SPEAKER_37]: So let's see, we do have a member from, I believe it was the National Grid or Verizon?

2396
03:00:54,775 --> 03:00:57,237
[SPEAKER_57]: I just unmuted Mr. Jankowski from National Grid.

2397
03:00:57,657 --> 03:01:02,940
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so let's see, I declare this public hearing open, open to those in favor of the petition.

2398
03:01:03,901 --> 03:01:06,683
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone in favor of the petition can now speak.

2399
03:01:07,604 --> 03:01:11,046
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anybody that would like to speak in favor of the petition?

2400
03:01:13,789 --> 03:01:15,671
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Jankowski, let's see.

2401
03:01:15,691 --> 03:01:24,300
[SPEAKER_32]: Adam, if you see him, can you unmute him?

2402
03:01:25,141 --> 03:01:25,782
[SPEAKER_57]: I unmuted him.

2403
03:01:26,763 --> 03:01:28,765
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Jankowski, name and address for the record, please.

2404
03:01:45,345 --> 03:01:49,751
[SPEAKER_38]: Go ahead, Kurt.

2405
03:01:50,733 --> 03:01:52,014
[SPEAKER_57]: I can try calling him again, if you'd like.

2406
03:01:53,937 --> 03:01:54,458
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, please.

2407
03:02:13,939 --> 03:02:15,903
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business, Mr. President.

2408
03:02:16,964 --> 03:02:20,430
[SPEAKER_37]: Do I have the motion of Council tonight to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by?

2409
03:02:21,773 --> 03:02:22,053
[SPEAKER_29]: Second.

2410
03:02:22,835 --> 03:02:24,598
[SPEAKER_37]: Council appears quicker to me, please call the roll.

2411
03:02:46,462 --> 03:02:46,982
[SPEAKER_38]: Clerk Carter, please.

2412
03:02:58,666 --> 03:02:59,346
[SPEAKER_57]: Sorry, Mr. President.

2413
03:02:59,366 --> 03:03:01,327
[SPEAKER_57]: I was on the phone with Mr. Jankowski.

2414
03:03:03,547 --> 03:03:05,588
[SPEAKER_57]: He's still trying to talk.

2415
03:03:05,628 --> 03:03:07,929
[SPEAKER_57]: For some reason, he can't answer.

2416
03:03:07,949 --> 03:03:10,209
[SPEAKER_37]: So we're going to refer it back to the regular order of business.

2417
03:03:10,229 --> 03:03:11,190
[SPEAKER_37]: So if you could please call the roll.

2418
03:03:11,910 --> 03:03:12,030
[SPEAKER_57]: OK.

2419
03:03:12,790 --> 03:03:14,811
[SPEAKER_37]: That was my council on 8th, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

2420
03:03:19,667 --> 03:03:20,247
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs?

2421
03:03:21,328 --> 03:03:21,588
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2422
03:03:22,209 --> 03:03:23,109
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Caravaglio?

2423
03:03:23,450 --> 03:03:23,690
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2424
03:03:24,490 --> 03:03:24,971
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

2425
03:03:25,671 --> 03:03:25,931
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2426
03:03:27,332 --> 03:03:27,893
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks?

2427
03:03:28,593 --> 03:03:28,913
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2428
03:03:29,414 --> 03:03:30,014
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell?

2429
03:03:30,655 --> 03:03:30,935
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2430
03:03:31,415 --> 03:03:32,176
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2431
03:03:33,076 --> 03:03:33,316
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2432
03:03:33,777 --> 03:03:34,497
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco?

2433
03:03:34,998 --> 03:03:35,238
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

2434
03:03:35,618 --> 03:03:37,199
[SPEAKER_37]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2435
03:03:37,219 --> 03:03:38,940
[SPEAKER_37]: We will now revert to the regular order of business.

2436
03:03:39,401 --> 03:03:43,223
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion to order is a resolution 20-492 offered by Vice President Caravaglio.

2437
03:03:47,406 --> 03:03:59,677
[SPEAKER_37]: It was all that the Memphis City Council instruct that the mayor, police chief and fire chief address the weekend parking issues in the Pine Ridge Road in the interest of public safety and neighborhood interest.

2438
03:04:00,118 --> 03:04:08,605
[SPEAKER_37]: We have further resolved that the city solicitor provide an opinion on private ways in the city of Memphis and what rights the residents of these streets have and don't have.

2439
03:04:08,986 --> 03:04:09,987
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Carviello.

2440
03:04:10,407 --> 03:04:11,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2441
03:04:11,328 --> 03:04:21,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, not a week goes by that my phone doesn't ring off the hook on a Saturday and Sunday from the residents of Pine Ridge and that whole area.

2442
03:04:22,998 --> 03:04:28,341
[SPEAKER_16]: with the inundated parking from people that are going over to the lakes.

2443
03:04:29,702 --> 03:04:32,143
[SPEAKER_16]: I've gone down there myself on many occasions.

2444
03:04:32,963 --> 03:04:34,024
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a two-lane road.

2445
03:04:34,424 --> 03:04:40,167
[SPEAKER_16]: You can barely fit one car down there, because they park on both sides of the street.

2446
03:04:40,687 --> 03:04:44,129
[SPEAKER_16]: And the worst part is, it isn't that they're just parking there.

2447
03:04:45,110 --> 03:04:45,690
[SPEAKER_16]: When they leave,

2448
03:04:46,351 --> 03:04:47,855
[SPEAKER_16]: they leave all their trash behind.

2449
03:04:48,456 --> 03:04:50,721
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not fair to those residents in that area.

2450
03:04:51,042 --> 03:04:53,047
[SPEAKER_16]: They have to go through this every single summer.

2451
03:04:56,782 --> 03:04:57,502
[SPEAKER_16]: during this time.

2452
03:04:58,243 --> 03:04:59,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Winchester had a similar problem.

2453
03:05:00,523 --> 03:05:08,885
[SPEAKER_16]: They addressed it, and they made no weekend parking all the way around where the Winchester Boat Club is, because they were getting inundated.

2454
03:05:09,785 --> 03:05:22,648
[SPEAKER_16]: But I said, drive down there on a Saturday and Sunday, you'll count the 150 cars parked all the way down Pine Ridge, all the way down to the other end, and they're going on to the other streets, all in that area.

2455
03:05:24,212 --> 03:05:27,634
[SPEAKER_16]: These people need some kind of help on the weekends.

2456
03:05:28,554 --> 03:05:43,421
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, up on Fulton Street, up by the top of Fulton Street by Rice Pond and up by the Fells, the MDC, DCR puts up horses so people don't park on all those streets.

2457
03:05:43,901 --> 03:05:51,385
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't understand why these people can't get the same relief on their streets also.

2458
03:05:52,987 --> 03:05:57,649
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, if there was ever a fire down there, there's no way you're feeding a fire truck down that street.

2459
03:05:58,289 --> 03:06:00,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Because as they say, because they're so clogged.

2460
03:06:00,951 --> 03:06:05,153
[SPEAKER_16]: And let's say, plus the neighborhood is just being overrun.

2461
03:06:05,633 --> 03:06:09,975
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's about time that the city step up and help these people out, Mr. President.

2462
03:06:11,635 --> 03:06:13,016
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

2463
03:06:13,056 --> 03:06:13,696
[SPEAKER_37]: Counselor Knight.

2464
03:06:16,177 --> 03:06:17,558
[SPEAKER_41]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2465
03:06:17,678 --> 03:06:20,659
[SPEAKER_41]: And through you to the sponsor of this resolution, thank you as well.

2466
03:06:22,461 --> 03:06:28,485
[SPEAKER_43]: Was it last week or the week before, maybe, that the city administration announced a pilot program?

2467
03:06:29,165 --> 03:06:33,748
[SPEAKER_43]: And this pilot program, I believe, was called the Shared Streets Initiative, Mr. President.

2468
03:06:34,588 --> 03:06:46,816
[SPEAKER_43]: And the Shared Streets Initiative, the goal was to close certain streets to vehicular access, except for those that require local access only, to allow for some relief

2469
03:06:47,426 --> 03:06:55,172
[SPEAKER_43]: during the COVID-19 crisis to ensure that people can participate in recreational activities while also remaining socially distanced.

2470
03:06:56,013 --> 03:07:02,298
[SPEAKER_43]: If we look at where Pine Ridge Road is located, it's right along the Mystic Valley Parkway by the lake.

2471
03:07:03,119 --> 03:07:07,122
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a recreational area and a recreational destination spot.

2472
03:07:07,882 --> 03:07:15,348
[SPEAKER_43]: So it might make sense, Mr. President, for us to look at Pine Ridge Road as one of those streets that we limit to local access only so that the residents in the neighborhood can

2473
03:07:17,113 --> 03:07:23,415
[SPEAKER_43]: partake in recreational activities while also being safe and also protecting the neighborhood.

2474
03:07:24,095 --> 03:07:31,137
[SPEAKER_43]: We see a lot of out-of-towners and a lot of people come to Medford to utilize the many amenities and resources that we have.

2475
03:07:31,357 --> 03:07:42,139
[SPEAKER_43]: And one of the best resources that we have are the Mystic Lakes, a ton of open space, a ton of protected land that our surrounding communities don't necessarily have.

2476
03:07:42,199 --> 03:07:44,920
[SPEAKER_43]: So people come here as a destination to partake in these amenities.

2477
03:07:46,113 --> 03:07:48,935
[SPEAKER_43]: But in the process of that, we are seeing an impact in our neighborhoods.

2478
03:07:49,095 --> 03:08:00,162
[SPEAKER_43]: So I think that expanding the shared street or piloting the shared street program along Pine Ridge Road is something that would be worthy of exploring, Mr. President, and I'd ask the administration to do such in the form of an amendment.

2479
03:08:01,904 --> 03:08:02,964
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2480
03:08:03,905 --> 03:08:06,587
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

2481
03:08:06,787 --> 03:08:07,667
[SPEAKER_37]: President Carviello.

2482
03:08:08,087 --> 03:08:08,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2483
03:08:08,928 --> 03:08:11,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, in the meantime, if the city

2484
03:08:12,981 --> 03:08:19,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Or the TCR could put up barriers on Saturdays and Sundays to give these people some kind of relief.

2485
03:08:20,303 --> 03:08:22,284
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be a great help to them.

2486
03:08:23,224 --> 03:08:34,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, people leave their house on a Sunday or Saturday, they come home, they have nowhere to park, their driveways are blocked, and they can't get back into their homes.

2487
03:08:35,708 --> 03:08:40,590
[SPEAKER_16]: So something has to be done for these people in the short term.

2488
03:08:42,777 --> 03:08:45,059
[SPEAKER_16]: At least for right now, Mr. President.

2489
03:08:46,460 --> 03:08:47,662
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Vice President Carvialo.

2490
03:08:47,682 --> 03:08:48,963
[SPEAKER_37]: Would you like to add that as an amendment?

2491
03:08:49,423 --> 03:08:50,404
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, I would.

2492
03:08:50,644 --> 03:08:51,365
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2493
03:08:51,385 --> 03:08:54,247
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Herves, if you could please add that as an amendment to the main resolution.

2494
03:08:55,588 --> 03:09:00,153
[SPEAKER_57]: I've got an amendment from Vice President Carvialo and an amendment from Councilor Martins.

2495
03:09:00,713 --> 03:09:01,213
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight.

2496
03:09:01,233 --> 03:09:02,575
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm sorry, Councilor Knight.

2497
03:09:03,455 --> 03:09:03,876
[SPEAKER_57]: No problem.

2498
03:09:04,917 --> 03:09:05,237
[SPEAKER_57]: Let's see.

2499
03:09:06,138 --> 03:09:08,620
[SPEAKER_38]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

2500
03:09:11,149 --> 03:09:14,111
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, any other questions or comments from the general public?

2501
03:09:17,434 --> 03:09:18,214
[SPEAKER_41]: Actually do have a question.

2502
03:09:18,715 --> 03:09:20,236
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Layton.

2503
03:09:21,097 --> 03:09:27,161
[SPEAKER_43]: I know Councilor Caviello mentions in his paper that Pine Ridge Road could potentially be a private way.

2504
03:09:28,022 --> 03:09:28,802
[SPEAKER_43]: It is a private way.

2505
03:09:29,223 --> 03:09:29,743
[SPEAKER_43]: It is a private way.

2506
03:09:29,763 --> 03:09:32,365
[SPEAKER_43]: I know in the past the council had requested

2507
03:09:34,249 --> 03:09:38,670
[SPEAKER_43]: a paper from Ben City Solicitor Rumley relative to private ways.

2508
03:09:38,730 --> 03:09:40,711
[SPEAKER_43]: And I do think that document will be very helpful.

2509
03:09:40,731 --> 03:09:46,192
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'd like to point out that the council is going down the right track and trying to come up with a solution, I think.

2510
03:09:46,232 --> 03:09:55,754
[SPEAKER_43]: I do believe that the residents of the private way do have the right to implement certain controls, like we've seen in other areas, Momola Way comes to mind.

2511
03:09:56,594 --> 03:09:58,435
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, Mr. President, thank you very much.

2512
03:09:58,515 --> 03:09:59,495
[SPEAKER_43]: I just wanted to clarify that.

2513
03:09:59,515 --> 03:09:59,915
[SPEAKER_43]: So thank you.

2514
03:10:00,355 --> 03:10:01,055
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Council Light.

2515
03:10:01,896 --> 03:10:03,316
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments from the public?

2516
03:10:05,819 --> 03:10:16,325
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, on the motion of Vice President Carabiello, as amended by Councilor Knight, and as amended by Vice President Carabiello, and seconded by?

2517
03:10:16,345 --> 03:10:16,465
[SPEAKER_37]: Second.

2518
03:10:18,627 --> 03:10:20,668
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

2519
03:10:20,748 --> 03:10:21,969
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Urdobez, please call the roll.

2520
03:10:23,390 --> 03:10:23,950
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs?

2521
03:10:24,871 --> 03:10:25,131
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2522
03:10:26,091 --> 03:10:26,932
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Carabiello?

2523
03:10:27,412 --> 03:10:27,652
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2524
03:10:28,353 --> 03:10:28,873
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

2525
03:10:31,835 --> 03:10:32,055
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes.

2526
03:10:33,305 --> 03:10:33,886
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks?

2527
03:10:34,487 --> 03:10:34,848
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2528
03:10:35,489 --> 03:10:36,110
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell?

2529
03:10:36,731 --> 03:10:37,012
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2530
03:10:37,512 --> 03:10:38,294
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2531
03:10:39,396 --> 03:10:39,656
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2532
03:10:40,197 --> 03:10:40,919
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Falco?

2533
03:10:41,680 --> 03:10:41,920
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

2534
03:10:42,301 --> 03:10:44,345
[SPEAKER_37]: 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

2535
03:10:45,285 --> 03:10:47,528
[SPEAKER_37]: 20-493 offered by Councilor Morrell.

2536
03:10:47,988 --> 03:10:59,961
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford requests that the DCR add an additional crosswalk on Elm Street where it intersects the entrance for Wright's Pond to increase the safety of pedestrians traveling to and from the pond.

2537
03:11:00,482 --> 03:11:05,907
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved that the City of Medford requests that the DCR repaint the existing crosswalks on Elm Street.

2538
03:11:06,728 --> 03:11:07,269
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Morrell.

2539
03:11:08,459 --> 03:11:09,419
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2540
03:11:09,719 --> 03:11:12,240
[SPEAKER_31]: I had a number of residents reach out to me about this.

2541
03:11:12,380 --> 03:11:20,482
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, this harkens back to a conversation we had earlier in the night, where you can just insert street name, and I almost saw someone get hit by a car trying to cross here.

2542
03:11:21,043 --> 03:11:36,027
[SPEAKER_31]: This is obviously an issue at Wrights Pond, where especially this year, with the permitting being a little bit changed, you might have much more frequent entrances and exits, and people have to travel up or they have to travel down to the farther crosswalks, which they themselves are fading.

2543
03:11:36,793 --> 03:11:42,138
[SPEAKER_31]: So after introducing this, I did have City Traffic Engineer Todd Blake reached out and we had a conversation.

2544
03:11:42,218 --> 03:11:47,663
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my understanding that the administration is looking at this as well as Representative Donato to try to find a solution.

2545
03:11:48,064 --> 03:11:53,088
[SPEAKER_31]: I guess there's a few mitigating factors that it's challenging to simply add a crosswalk.

2546
03:11:53,208 --> 03:11:57,312
[SPEAKER_31]: And I guess some other things have been held up as a result of the pandemic hitting.

2547
03:11:57,793 --> 03:12:02,557
[SPEAKER_31]: So this is something that the administration is working on, but I do move for approval.

2548
03:12:04,206 --> 03:12:09,170
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, and the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Peers.

2549
03:12:09,190 --> 03:12:10,572
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, thank you.

2550
03:12:10,592 --> 03:12:12,093
[SPEAKER_37]: There were a number of comments.

2551
03:12:12,113 --> 03:12:13,834
[SPEAKER_37]: So we have Councilor Peers and Councilor Knight.

2552
03:12:13,874 --> 03:12:14,535
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Peers.

2553
03:12:15,676 --> 03:12:17,798
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to add that I fully support this.

2554
03:12:17,838 --> 03:12:23,063
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm a neighbor down the street on Fellsway West, and we need safer crossings on Elm Street.

2555
03:12:24,684 --> 03:12:25,585
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

2556
03:12:25,625 --> 03:12:26,125
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Knight.

2557
03:12:27,106 --> 03:12:30,109
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. President, this has been an ongoing problem for

2558
03:12:31,812 --> 03:12:32,373
[SPEAKER_43]: Gene, let me see.

2559
03:12:32,393 --> 03:12:38,620
[SPEAKER_43]: I think I started working with Charlie Shannon in 1999, and this was a problem then, and it's been an ongoing problem since.

2560
03:12:39,100 --> 03:12:51,074
[SPEAKER_43]: And working with Representative Donato over the last several years and looking at this issue, I think one of the major hurdles that we're facing is the DCR and their engineering division feels as though

2561
03:12:51,564 --> 03:12:56,971
[SPEAKER_43]: The gradient in the sight lines at this location by Wright's Pond are inappropriate for a crosswalk.

2562
03:12:56,991 --> 03:12:58,653
[SPEAKER_43]: They don't meet the standards that have been established.

2563
03:12:59,574 --> 03:13:08,446
[SPEAKER_43]: So while it'll create some pedestrian safety for crossing, I guess it creates some other problems relative to traffic flow and safety of stopping and the like.

2564
03:13:09,267 --> 03:13:11,689
[SPEAKER_43]: So this is an issue that's been ongoing for a number of years.

2565
03:13:12,169 --> 03:13:19,375
[SPEAKER_43]: I thank the Council for bringing it up and I also want to recognize the fact that you know this is something that Mr. Donato has been working on for quite a bit of time.

2566
03:13:20,056 --> 03:13:21,377
[SPEAKER_43]: It's something that needs to be addressed.

2567
03:13:21,737 --> 03:13:24,740
[SPEAKER_43]: The DCR has, you know, done a mismatch of

2568
03:13:25,912 --> 03:13:42,482
[SPEAKER_43]: enforcement applications up along the Elm Street area, whether it comes to parking along the fog line and the like for homes that don't have driveways and some other material movements to, you know, keep the pond safer, keep the area around the pond safer, and also address traffic infrastructure needs.

2569
03:13:43,222 --> 03:13:48,705
[SPEAKER_43]: But right now we're seeing some changes down at the Highland Ave intersection, Mr. President, along the Felsway, which is right down the street as well.

2570
03:13:49,105 --> 03:13:53,387
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think these traffic improvements should help our case in moving forward.

2571
03:13:53,427 --> 03:14:06,154
[SPEAKER_43]: If they can get a traffic study done over in the city of Malden and address some of the concerns that they have over there, right down the street from us in an area that's not abutting one of our most popular recreational centers, then I think it's important that we pursue this.

2572
03:14:06,734 --> 03:14:16,459
[SPEAKER_43]: I think Councilor Marks was on the right track when he spoke about a traffic study and the need for a traffic study over in the Glenwood area or Medford over in Mr. Serino's house and the like.

2573
03:14:16,899 --> 03:14:22,482
[SPEAKER_43]: And I don't think we're going to be able to accomplish the goals that we want to accomplish in this area without our own.

2574
03:14:22,882 --> 03:14:35,588
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'd like to amend the paper and request that our traffic engineer conduct an independent traffic study or conduct an informal traffic study on behalf of the city of Medford to begin to formalize arguments against the state's rejection that's been

2575
03:14:36,437 --> 03:14:38,118
[SPEAKER_43]: well publicized in the past.

2576
03:14:38,138 --> 03:14:42,361
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, I offer that in the form of an amendment, Mr. President, and I thank the sponsors for bringing this matter forward.

2577
03:14:42,961 --> 03:14:43,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor.

2578
03:14:43,662 --> 03:14:45,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Carriello.

2579
03:14:45,923 --> 03:14:46,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2580
03:14:46,644 --> 03:14:49,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I think we all know this is an ongoing problem.

2581
03:14:50,846 --> 03:14:53,908
[SPEAKER_16]: The biggest problem is the entrance to Rice Ponds.

2582
03:14:54,288 --> 03:14:55,889
[SPEAKER_16]: It's on a blind turn.

2583
03:14:56,650 --> 03:15:01,373
[SPEAKER_16]: So to put a crosswalk there would be very dangerous, but what it should have

2584
03:15:01,889 --> 03:15:05,190
[SPEAKER_16]: is a light further up with a push button.

2585
03:15:05,210 --> 03:15:10,411
[SPEAKER_16]: So when people want to cross, the light would stop maybe 10 to 15 yards away.

2586
03:15:10,431 --> 03:15:13,952
[SPEAKER_16]: That would stop the cars as the people are crossing.

2587
03:15:14,672 --> 03:15:23,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Or maybe we should look at at some point changing the entrance of Wright's Pawn so it's not directly on the turn.

2588
03:15:25,055 --> 03:15:28,135
[SPEAKER_16]: So when cars come down, they won't see anybody in the crosswalk.

2589
03:15:28,476 --> 03:15:29,976
[SPEAKER_16]: That's really the biggest issue there.

2590
03:15:31,926 --> 03:15:33,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

2591
03:15:33,627 --> 03:15:34,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morrell.

2592
03:15:35,187 --> 03:15:35,868
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2593
03:15:35,888 --> 03:15:40,210
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I just want to add that I thank my fellow councilors for their design ideas.

2594
03:15:40,270 --> 03:15:52,615
[SPEAKER_31]: And in talking with the traffic engineer and his areas of expertise, I understand that they're looking at the many ways they can approach this to be in compliance with certain ADA things, the sight line, all of that.

2595
03:15:53,035 --> 03:16:00,338
[SPEAKER_31]: They're definitely working on getting creative to make this a much safer crossing, whether the existing crossings,

2596
03:16:00,788 --> 03:16:02,329
[SPEAKER_31]: adding this crossing if possible.

2597
03:16:02,449 --> 03:16:07,291
[SPEAKER_31]: So I think the ideas are definitely there and to Councilor Knight's point, it's just making it happen.

2598
03:16:08,192 --> 03:16:08,652
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you.

2599
03:16:09,232 --> 03:16:10,133
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

2600
03:16:10,553 --> 03:16:13,755
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments from the council or councilors?

2601
03:16:17,236 --> 03:16:17,596
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

2602
03:16:18,337 --> 03:16:20,238
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments from the public?

2603
03:16:21,258 --> 03:16:23,579
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's see, we have Marshall.

2604
03:16:23,599 --> 03:16:26,621
[SPEAKER_36]: Name and address for the record, please, Marshall.

2605
03:16:27,978 --> 03:16:30,019
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I'm Marshall Mootenode, 33 Waterville.

2606
03:16:31,319 --> 03:16:38,421
[SPEAKER_20]: I run all the streets around the Fells, and this one is by far the scariest crossing.

2607
03:16:39,221 --> 03:16:40,482
[SPEAKER_20]: I almost got hit by a car.

2608
03:16:40,502 --> 03:16:44,483
[SPEAKER_20]: And for the longest time, I couldn't understand why.

2609
03:16:44,503 --> 03:16:48,084
[SPEAKER_20]: I couldn't get cars even to stop for me during rush hour.

2610
03:16:48,104 --> 03:16:52,405
[SPEAKER_20]: I would sometimes wave a stick out into the street, like, please stop.

2611
03:16:53,266 --> 03:16:56,287
[SPEAKER_20]: And repainting the crosswalk will not do anything.

2612
03:16:56,467 --> 03:16:57,747
[SPEAKER_20]: You cannot see the crosswalk.

2613
03:16:59,224 --> 03:17:00,685
[SPEAKER_20]: in a car as you approach it.

2614
03:17:01,885 --> 03:17:07,908
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't realize that until I approached it in a car, finally, but you just cannot see it.

2615
03:17:08,788 --> 03:17:16,131
[SPEAKER_20]: The two signs are small, you know, there's also, there's, it's just not, I think it needs to be reimagined.

2616
03:17:19,409 --> 03:17:30,211
[SPEAKER_20]: Furthermore, I think it's, I'm really glad to hear that the traffic engineer is thinking about this comprehensively, because there are a number of confusing factors on this road.

2617
03:17:30,851 --> 03:17:42,793
[SPEAKER_20]: You have a 25 mile an hour speed limit, then a speed light thing that flashes only when you're above 35, and then a 30 mile per hour speed limit five feet ahead of that.

2618
03:17:42,853 --> 03:17:46,314
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's just, it's a mess right now and really, really dangerous.

2619
03:17:48,157 --> 03:17:51,820
[SPEAKER_20]: So I am glad that we're thinking about this.

2620
03:17:52,000 --> 03:18:03,109
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we need to go beyond painting, probably beyond another crosswalk, because getting cars to stop is the problem.

2621
03:18:04,471 --> 03:18:13,398
[SPEAKER_20]: And then finally, to tie it into some of the other conversations that have been going on tonight, I think if we're looking to limit parking at places of recreation,

2622
03:18:14,512 --> 03:18:21,157
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, Mystic River and the Fells, those are kind of the two gems of recreation within outdoor recreation in our community.

2623
03:18:22,178 --> 03:18:31,744
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to really make sure that if parking is limited, then the neighbors who live in those spaces can easily and safely access those places without a car.

2624
03:18:32,865 --> 03:18:34,887
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that really needs to happen.

2625
03:18:35,867 --> 03:18:43,793
[SPEAKER_20]: I purchased a car solely so I could safely get to Wright's Pond and the Fells, and it's like a mile away.

2626
03:18:44,359 --> 03:18:50,026
[SPEAKER_20]: I can get there easily, just not safely with my dog, my partner, all of those things.

2627
03:18:50,066 --> 03:18:53,409
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that's a really important consideration.

2628
03:18:54,571 --> 03:18:54,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks.

2629
03:18:55,492 --> 03:18:55,852
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2630
03:18:57,734 --> 03:19:01,078
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments from the public?

2631
03:19:05,303 --> 03:19:05,423
[SPEAKER_37]: OK.

2632
03:19:07,559 --> 03:19:09,481
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Morales, I'd like to thank you for bringing this forward.

2633
03:19:09,521 --> 03:19:16,887
[SPEAKER_37]: As someone who lives up in this neighborhood, I think any type of public safety improvements that we can make up on Elm Street should be looked at.

2634
03:19:17,808 --> 03:19:27,375
[SPEAKER_37]: As the councilors have mentioned, I know since I've been on the city council, even before that, this has been an issue, but it's something that we need to make sure that we keep an eye on.

2635
03:19:27,475 --> 03:19:32,779
[SPEAKER_37]: And hopefully if we can work with the state, I know Representative Donato has been working on this for a while.

2636
03:19:35,359 --> 03:19:40,461
[SPEAKER_37]: Any public safety improvements that we can make in this area will benefit everyone.

2637
03:19:40,501 --> 03:19:41,561
[SPEAKER_37]: It can be very dangerous.

2638
03:19:41,601 --> 03:19:49,063
[SPEAKER_37]: That driveway going in and out of Wrights Pond is in a really difficult position because it's really a blind spot.

2639
03:19:49,823 --> 03:19:52,544
[SPEAKER_37]: But we need to make sure we keep it on the radar.

2640
03:19:52,584 --> 03:19:55,145
[SPEAKER_37]: We need to make sure that we, you know,

2641
03:19:55,717 --> 03:20:02,360
[SPEAKER_37]: really look at every possibility we can to make it safe for everyone to exit and enter the pond.

2642
03:20:02,440 --> 03:20:04,121
[SPEAKER_37]: So, thank you for bringing this forward.

2643
03:20:04,841 --> 03:20:11,664
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Behrs, as amended by Councilor Knight.

2644
03:20:12,284 --> 03:20:13,745
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk, please call the roll.

2645
03:20:17,567 --> 03:20:18,187
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs?

2646
03:20:19,107 --> 03:20:19,387
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2647
03:20:20,208 --> 03:20:21,108
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Caravaglia?

2648
03:20:21,568 --> 03:20:21,828
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2649
03:20:22,289 --> 03:20:22,749
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

2650
03:20:26,451 --> 03:20:26,751
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2651
03:20:27,933 --> 03:20:28,834
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2652
03:20:29,415 --> 03:20:29,695
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2653
03:20:30,436 --> 03:20:31,037
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell.

2654
03:20:31,718 --> 03:20:31,978
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2655
03:20:32,439 --> 03:20:33,200
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2656
03:20:34,382 --> 03:20:34,622
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

2657
03:20:35,123 --> 03:20:35,784
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco.

2658
03:20:36,564 --> 03:20:39,426
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, seven affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2659
03:20:39,446 --> 03:20:55,757
[SPEAKER_37]: 20-497 offered by Council of Mayors, whereas systemic racism is an ongoing public health crisis that necessitates urgent action and whereas statements of solidarity and support can begin to address the history of racism and discrimination in our community.

2660
03:20:55,937 --> 03:21:06,304
[SPEAKER_37]: And whereas residents of Medford have requested that the city take this action now, therefore be resolved by the Medford City Council that the city of Medford will hang a banner reading Black Lives Matter

2661
03:21:06,684 --> 03:21:08,105
[SPEAKER_37]: on the front of Medford City Hall.

2662
03:21:08,305 --> 03:21:08,925
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Behrs.

2663
03:21:10,206 --> 03:21:11,087
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2664
03:21:11,587 --> 03:21:19,211
[SPEAKER_29]: I bring this resolution before the council today at the request of hundreds of residents who've asked that we hang a Black Lives Matter banner on Medford City Hall.

2665
03:21:20,072 --> 03:21:26,135
[SPEAKER_29]: This moment of uprising and reckoning with our history of white supremacy and racism demands it.

2666
03:21:26,795 --> 03:21:34,840
[SPEAKER_29]: As my fellow councilors and the public know, many communities have placed similar banners on schools, town halls, and other city buildings to show solidarity, respect, and support

2667
03:21:35,285 --> 03:21:40,848
[SPEAKER_29]: for the movement to address the ongoing structural racism that has been tearing families and communities apart in this country for centuries.

2668
03:21:41,748 --> 03:22:03,700
[SPEAKER_29]: We've seen protests and demonstrations for Black lives in our community, thousands of people standing up in person, online, through lawn signs and conversations to say no more, to say that we will not sweep this under the rug or treat this as a side issue when we know we can't move forward as a nation, as a community, or as a human family without permanent transformative change on the issues of structural racism and economic inequity.

2669
03:22:04,420 --> 03:22:06,902
[SPEAKER_29]: I expect we will have a robust discussion tonight.

2670
03:22:07,562 --> 03:22:14,528
[SPEAKER_29]: I hope it does not include any conspiracy theories that have been being forwarded around about this being some sort of fundraising front for the Democratic Party.

2671
03:22:15,268 --> 03:22:19,872
[SPEAKER_29]: And I also expect to hear the need to take action and not just say more words.

2672
03:22:19,912 --> 03:22:23,375
[SPEAKER_29]: And the assertion that this is about symbolism and not about substance.

2673
03:22:24,475 --> 03:22:31,581
[SPEAKER_29]: I would agree that it's about time that we dive deeply into charter review, rethinking how we elect elected officials in an all at large way.

2674
03:22:32,507 --> 03:22:37,371
[SPEAKER_29]: that diminishes racial representation and has been struck down by courts in other Massachusetts communities.

2675
03:22:38,111 --> 03:22:47,878
[SPEAKER_29]: I would agree that it's about time that we transform our city zoning and really root out the history of racial bias and zoning that permeated the zoning process when zoning was last reviewed in the city decades ago.

2676
03:22:48,839 --> 03:22:49,840
[SPEAKER_29]: Action is necessary.

2677
03:22:50,320 --> 03:22:55,003
[SPEAKER_29]: These are urgent projects on the path of transformation and they will take time, but words matter.

2678
03:22:55,884 --> 03:22:56,524
[SPEAKER_29]: Words matter.

2679
03:22:57,705 --> 03:22:58,646
[SPEAKER_29]: What we say matters.

2680
03:22:59,286 --> 03:23:01,248
[SPEAKER_29]: How we convey our support to the community matters.

2681
03:23:01,738 --> 03:23:05,962
[SPEAKER_29]: And I hope that by saying these words, we spur ourselves to take on the bigger things that we have to do as well.

2682
03:23:06,923 --> 03:23:21,678
[SPEAKER_29]: We know, and we've heard from Black parents and children and grandparents and brothers and sisters and neighbors and friends, from our neighbors and friends and residents of color, that this community has caused harm, that many have felt exclusion and disillusion and persecution in this community.

2683
03:23:22,499 --> 03:23:23,620
[SPEAKER_29]: I can never understand that.

2684
03:23:24,568 --> 03:23:35,870
[SPEAKER_29]: But when I try to even imagine the thousand stabs and paper cuts that our coworkers, neighbors, and friends of color experience on a daily basis, I can't begin to describe the horror that I feel.

2685
03:23:36,550 --> 03:23:51,353
[SPEAKER_29]: And I want every black parent, every child of color, every person in this community to know and to see when they walk by our city hall, the seat of power in this community, that we stand with them, that we hear them, that we will listen to them, talk to them,

2686
03:23:52,011 --> 03:23:56,212
[SPEAKER_29]: and empower them to lead this fight and fight alongside them, undaunted and undeterred.

2687
03:23:57,012 --> 03:24:13,297
[SPEAKER_29]: If my best friend experiences racist treatment, which I've seen over and over when we've been together, and then drives by our city hall, I want him to look up and see that we know that his life matters and that we are working to make that truly alive and real for everyone who calls Medford home.

2688
03:24:14,458 --> 03:24:15,638
[SPEAKER_29]: I wanna look up and know that.

2689
03:24:16,578 --> 03:24:18,739
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, that's why I put forward this resolution

2690
03:24:19,246 --> 03:24:24,250
[SPEAKER_29]: why I and many others think this is a necessary and overdue step, and why I ask for my colleague's support.

2691
03:24:24,670 --> 03:24:24,990
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2692
03:24:26,051 --> 03:24:27,072
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

2693
03:24:28,272 --> 03:24:30,314
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, Councilor Morrell.

2694
03:24:31,555 --> 03:24:32,616
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2695
03:24:32,636 --> 03:24:35,037
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I wanna thank Councilor Behrs for bringing this forward.

2696
03:24:35,097 --> 03:24:38,380
[SPEAKER_31]: I have a few comments on this if I could just read them off.

2697
03:24:39,400 --> 03:24:42,302
[SPEAKER_31]: So some people will say this is symbolism, and I definitely agree.

2698
03:24:42,583 --> 03:24:47,226
[SPEAKER_31]: It's symbolic of the commitments that we've made as a city, and this is the easy thing.

2699
03:24:47,728 --> 03:24:50,370
[SPEAKER_31]: If we can't do the easy thing, how will we do the hard work?

2700
03:24:50,890 --> 03:24:58,815
[SPEAKER_31]: How will we ensure that in 5, 10, 15, 25, 50 years, we're not right back here having done nothing of substance and learned nothing?

2701
03:24:59,535 --> 03:25:04,318
[SPEAKER_31]: So the uncomfortable truth is that for far too long, this country has said that Black lives do not matter.

2702
03:25:04,778 --> 03:25:11,002
[SPEAKER_31]: Their disparate health outcomes, their housing discrimination, and unequal rates of school suspension, arrests, and imprisonment.

2703
03:25:11,522 --> 03:25:12,583
[SPEAKER_31]: We say they do not matter.

2704
03:25:12,863 --> 03:25:17,366
[SPEAKER_31]: We said they do not matter by saying that all men are created equal, but in fact, not meaning Black men.

2705
03:25:18,188 --> 03:25:29,132
[SPEAKER_31]: So through chattel slavery, segregation, limiting voting rights, and Jim Crow, we have said that black lives do not matter, which is why we must now state unequivocally that black lives do matter.

2706
03:25:29,612 --> 03:25:31,513
[SPEAKER_31]: To say so is not a political act.

2707
03:25:31,853 --> 03:25:33,153
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a statement of human rights.

2708
03:25:34,073 --> 03:25:37,155
[SPEAKER_31]: We've declared systemic racism a public health crisis in this city.

2709
03:25:37,675 --> 03:25:44,577
[SPEAKER_31]: And perhaps if we have a reminder in front of city hall every day, we will make good on the work that is needed to actually address this crisis.

2710
03:25:45,057 --> 03:25:46,478
[SPEAKER_31]: And for this, I support this measure.

2711
03:25:46,778 --> 03:25:47,098
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2712
03:25:48,561 --> 03:25:49,421
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

2713
03:25:50,802 --> 03:25:53,363
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

2714
03:25:59,165 --> 03:26:00,465
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, let's see.

2715
03:26:00,505 --> 03:26:07,568
[SPEAKER_37]: So on the motion of Councilor Behrs, I know a number of people have their hands up, but on the motion of Councilor Behrs, instead of a second.

2716
03:26:08,408 --> 03:26:09,329
[SPEAKER_41]: If I may, Mr. President.

2717
03:26:09,789 --> 03:26:10,229
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Lateef.

2718
03:26:13,271 --> 03:26:20,634
[SPEAKER_43]: Is there a policy in place that the administration abides by or goes by relative to the signing of the hanging of signs and banners on City Hall?

2719
03:26:22,775 --> 03:26:24,096
[SPEAKER_37]: I am not aware of one.

2720
03:26:25,977 --> 03:26:29,698
[SPEAKER_43]: I just, I support, you know, what Councilor Baez is saying.

2721
03:26:29,758 --> 03:26:31,139
[SPEAKER_43]: I say, you know, black lives do matter.

2722
03:26:31,359 --> 03:26:32,399
[SPEAKER_43]: I have no problem saying that.

2723
03:26:33,260 --> 03:26:38,242
[SPEAKER_43]: But I do have a concern when what happens when the next group comes down and says we want to hang our sign on City Hall too.

2724
03:26:43,280 --> 03:26:44,662
[SPEAKER_43]: What are the parameters?

2725
03:26:44,862 --> 03:26:45,523
[SPEAKER_43]: What are the guidelines?

2726
03:26:45,543 --> 03:26:48,266
[SPEAKER_43]: What are the criteria that the administration is going to put into play?

2727
03:26:48,867 --> 03:26:55,055
[SPEAKER_43]: Ultimately, we're not the body that's in charge or control of hanging anything on any city building.

2728
03:26:55,075 --> 03:26:56,016
[SPEAKER_43]: We're the legislative body.

2729
03:26:56,036 --> 03:26:57,378
[SPEAKER_43]: We're responsible for money and zoning.

2730
03:26:58,632 --> 03:26:59,392
[SPEAKER_43]: ordinances.

2731
03:26:59,812 --> 03:27:05,274
[SPEAKER_43]: So in looking at how this is going to play out and going forward, so what are we doing?

2732
03:27:05,294 --> 03:27:09,095
[SPEAKER_43]: We're telling the mayor, hang the sign, and the mayor's going to go, well, I have a policy that says I will.

2733
03:27:09,175 --> 03:27:10,295
[SPEAKER_43]: I have a policy that says I won't.

2734
03:27:10,435 --> 03:27:11,375
[SPEAKER_43]: There is no policy.

2735
03:27:11,435 --> 03:27:12,495
[SPEAKER_43]: We're working on a policy.

2736
03:27:13,076 --> 03:27:15,296
[SPEAKER_43]: I think it's important to know what the rules of the game are.

2737
03:27:20,397 --> 03:27:21,017
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President?

2738
03:27:23,518 --> 03:27:24,898
[SPEAKER_44]: Councilor Marks?

2739
03:27:26,339 --> 03:27:27,359
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2740
03:27:28,181 --> 03:27:30,522
[SPEAKER_44]: And I, too, have a statement tonight that I'd like to read.

2741
03:27:32,063 --> 03:27:38,187
[SPEAKER_44]: I first heard the phrase Black Lives Matter back in 2012, when Trayvon Martin was shot to death.

2742
03:27:39,287 --> 03:27:45,251
[SPEAKER_44]: After that, Michael Brown, a young African-American, was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.

2743
03:27:46,331 --> 03:27:54,396
[SPEAKER_44]: Then another African-American, Eric Gander, died after being put in a chokehold by the New York City police officer.

2744
03:27:55,643 --> 03:28:15,431
[SPEAKER_44]: These incidences and many others leading up to George Floyd's murder this year have led me to understand how the seeds of slavery, discrimination, and prejudice continue to threaten the ability of black Americans and others to equally enjoy the freedoms that we profess as a country.

2745
03:28:16,596 --> 03:28:20,817
[SPEAKER_44]: So I am proud to join with so many others and state that black lives matter.

2746
03:28:21,857 --> 03:28:35,940
[SPEAKER_44]: I do so with the desire that in making this statement, it will facilitate the clear acknowledgement of the destructive effect that discrimination and prejudice has had and continues to have in our country.

2747
03:28:36,640 --> 03:28:42,641
[SPEAKER_44]: And my hope will encourage all Americans to work to erase inequality.

2748
03:28:43,746 --> 03:28:51,933
[SPEAKER_44]: But as we consider this resolution, I have an important question for the mayor about hanging banners on public buildings such as City Hall.

2749
03:28:53,094 --> 03:28:58,438
[SPEAKER_44]: My question is directed at the mayor because she has full authority over this building.

2750
03:28:59,499 --> 03:29:10,629
[SPEAKER_44]: My question is this, what standards or procedures does the mayor use in deciding what signs or messages will be placed on City Hall?

2751
03:29:11,892 --> 03:29:19,834
[SPEAKER_44]: The reason that I ask this question is because the right to use a government building to display a message is not unlimited.

2752
03:29:20,754 --> 03:29:25,535
[SPEAKER_44]: This is especially true if the building is a public forum like City Hall.

2753
03:29:26,815 --> 03:29:39,338
[SPEAKER_44]: If the mayor is going to allow City Hall to be used to display various messages, then the First Amendment requires that the city not discriminate among various messages or points of view.

2754
03:29:40,606 --> 03:29:45,288
[SPEAKER_44]: Any standard applied by the city must be content neutral.

2755
03:29:46,428 --> 03:29:51,309
[SPEAKER_44]: An example would be if a pro-life group wanted to hang a banner on City Hall.

2756
03:29:52,230 --> 03:29:59,152
[SPEAKER_44]: The city could not prohibit that, and nor could it prohibit a pro-choice group from also having its banner placed.

2757
03:30:00,032 --> 03:30:08,255
[SPEAKER_44]: So you can see that we should receive from the mayor a description of what the standards she applies in hanging banners.

2758
03:30:09,321 --> 03:30:19,317
[SPEAKER_44]: Otherwise, we could be at risk of turning City Hall building into a billboard battle zone of conflicting and possibly polarizing messages.

2759
03:30:20,433 --> 03:30:26,034
[SPEAKER_44]: In Method, we have experienced the impact that banners and signs have on our rights.

2760
03:30:27,014 --> 03:30:42,998
[SPEAKER_44]: It was just two years ago when this council voted to stop using the VFW building on Mystic Ave as a voting location because some voters stated they were less inclined to vote because of a sign displayed on the building.

2761
03:30:44,038 --> 03:30:48,699
[SPEAKER_44]: I mention this because City Hall itself is used as a voting location.

2762
03:30:49,741 --> 03:31:07,430
[SPEAKER_44]: So before we vote on a resolution, I am simply asking my council colleagues that we request that the mayor give us a full description of the standards or procedures she uses in determining what banners or signs will be allowed to be placed on City Hall.

2763
03:31:08,350 --> 03:31:16,094
[SPEAKER_44]: Having the mayor respond is a prudent and reasonable step to take when First Amendment and other rights are involved.

2764
03:31:17,113 --> 03:31:27,960
[SPEAKER_44]: So at this point, Mr. President, I would offer a motion to receive and place on file the original resolution of paper 20-497.

2765
03:31:28,880 --> 03:31:46,191
[SPEAKER_44]: And I offer a motion requesting that the mayor provide the council with the full description of the standards or procedures the mayor uses in determining what banners or signs will be allowed to be placed on City Hall.

2766
03:31:47,349 --> 03:31:47,729
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

2767
03:31:49,110 --> 03:31:50,271
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2768
03:31:50,811 --> 03:32:01,559
[SPEAKER_57]: Clerk Hernandez, do you have the... I lost a good chunk of what Councilor Marks said after he moved to receive in place on file.

2769
03:32:03,780 --> 03:32:07,083
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Marks, would you mind reading that back to the clerk?

2770
03:32:07,923 --> 03:32:08,444
[SPEAKER_44]: Not at all.

2771
03:32:08,904 --> 03:32:09,224
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

2772
03:32:10,365 --> 03:32:14,368
[SPEAKER_44]: So it would be a motion requesting that the mayor

2773
03:32:16,681 --> 03:32:42,093
[SPEAKER_44]: provide the council with a full description of the standards or procedures the mayor uses in determining what banners or signs will be allowed to be placed on city hall.

2774
03:32:46,476 --> 03:32:53,281
[SPEAKER_44]: So the first motion was to receive and place on file the original resolution, which is paper 20-497.

2775
03:32:53,841 --> 03:32:57,584
[SPEAKER_44]: And then the motion was what I just offered, Mr. Clerk.

2776
03:32:58,565 --> 03:32:58,845
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

2777
03:33:00,523 --> 03:33:01,743
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Marks.

2778
03:33:02,084 --> 03:33:06,805
[SPEAKER_37]: We have, let's see, we have Vice President Carvillo, then I believe Councilor Peters after that.

2779
03:33:07,085 --> 03:33:07,886
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Carvillo.

2780
03:33:08,386 --> 03:33:09,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2781
03:33:09,086 --> 03:33:19,110
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, Mr. President, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing that forward, because it is a good test to see where, what goes up there and what doesn't.

2782
03:33:19,330 --> 03:33:25,372
[SPEAKER_16]: In the past, we've seen community events up there, nonprofit organizations,

2783
03:33:25,832 --> 03:33:26,592
[SPEAKER_16]: and things like that.

2784
03:33:27,233 --> 03:33:36,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, to make this building a billboard for all kinds of things, it would be a travesty.

2785
03:33:36,095 --> 03:33:38,976
[SPEAKER_16]: And some people say that we have too much on there now as it is.

2786
03:33:39,977 --> 03:33:53,981
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I'll second Councilor Mox's motion to receive the placement file until we get a definition from the mayor to what the rules and regulations are to put a sign on City Hall.

2787
03:33:56,650 --> 03:33:58,832
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Vice President Carriello.

2788
03:33:58,952 --> 03:34:02,154
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, we have Councilor Behrs and then Councilor Knight.

2789
03:34:02,194 --> 03:34:02,815
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Behrs.

2790
03:34:03,735 --> 03:34:04,556
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2791
03:34:04,656 --> 03:34:13,763
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I was actually going to make a similar point that there have been a variety of banners with co-logoed with the city and private organizations.

2792
03:34:13,843 --> 03:34:15,204
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm not sure what the policy is.

2793
03:34:15,264 --> 03:34:21,529
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm certainly interested to see what the policy is, just specifically on the First Amendment argument and the idea that the city hall could become a billboard.

2794
03:34:22,589 --> 03:34:24,871
[SPEAKER_29]: The First Amendment is designed to protect

2795
03:34:26,474 --> 03:34:35,196
[SPEAKER_29]: citizens of the United States, and it's incorporated to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts through the 14th Amendment, from the government interfering with the private right to communicate.

2796
03:34:35,676 --> 03:34:39,877
[SPEAKER_29]: The government has not offered City Hall as a billboard to anyone.

2797
03:34:40,057 --> 03:34:44,599
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not that any citizen could just come and apply to put whatever banner up that they want, as far as I know.

2798
03:34:45,499 --> 03:34:50,000
[SPEAKER_29]: So if such a process were to be initiated, then there may be First Amendment concerns.

2799
03:34:50,040 --> 03:34:54,561
[SPEAKER_29]: But if the city itself is deciding what messages to put out on city property,

2800
03:34:55,563 --> 03:34:59,266
[SPEAKER_29]: and not an open input for, you know, it's not a bulletin board, right?

2801
03:35:00,226 --> 03:35:02,248
[SPEAKER_29]: That's the difference in the First Amendment.

2802
03:35:02,288 --> 03:35:05,370
[SPEAKER_29]: The city has a complete right to put messages up on city property.

2803
03:35:05,850 --> 03:35:17,277
[SPEAKER_29]: It doesn't have the right to infringe on private property and, well, it doesn't have the right to infringe on the residents' use of their free speech or freedom of expression.

2804
03:35:20,399 --> 03:35:21,720
[SPEAKER_37]: Point of information, Mr. President?

2805
03:35:22,230 --> 03:35:23,171
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Beas.

2806
03:35:23,291 --> 03:35:24,673
[SPEAKER_37]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

2807
03:35:25,514 --> 03:35:27,777
[SPEAKER_44]: I appreciate Councilor Beas bringing that up.

2808
03:35:28,398 --> 03:35:30,321
[SPEAKER_44]: I just want to draw the light, Mr. President.

2809
03:35:30,681 --> 03:35:33,285
[SPEAKER_44]: There was a recent court case just entered in the U.S.

2810
03:35:33,305 --> 03:35:34,907
[SPEAKER_44]: District Court on July 1st, 2020.

2811
03:35:37,330 --> 03:35:41,732
[SPEAKER_44]: And it's the case of Judicial Watch versus the mayor of D.C.

2812
03:35:42,712 --> 03:35:49,815
[SPEAKER_44]: And on June 5th of this year, Mr. President, artists, demonstrators, residents, and employees of D.C.

2813
03:35:50,595 --> 03:35:54,816
[SPEAKER_44]: painted Black Lives Matter on 16th Street in Washington, D.C.

2814
03:35:55,917 --> 03:36:01,679
[SPEAKER_44]: The next day, June 6th, protesters painted Defund the Police next to Black Lives Matter.

2815
03:36:03,074 --> 03:36:11,083
[SPEAKER_44]: The mayor of DC, Muriel Bowser, supported the painting on the street, but there was no permit or approval process.

2816
03:36:12,364 --> 03:36:24,597
[SPEAKER_44]: Judicial Watch then wrote to Mayor Bowser and asked that their model, because no one is above the law, be painted on another street of the similar size.

2817
03:36:25,902 --> 03:36:39,315
[SPEAKER_44]: In its letter to the mayor, Judicial Watch said it has tried to find procedures for getting approval for painting a message on a street near its offices, but could not find any procedures or permit process.

2818
03:36:40,216 --> 03:36:45,402
[SPEAKER_44]: The deputy mayor then wrote back to Judicial Watch and said that it should apply for a permit.

2819
03:36:46,397 --> 03:36:54,408
[SPEAKER_44]: Judicial Watch then checked out the District of Columbia's website, but could not find a permit process to paint on a street.

2820
03:36:54,949 --> 03:37:00,377
[SPEAKER_44]: And when it contacted the Public Works Department, it was told, we never heard of that permit.

2821
03:37:01,274 --> 03:37:06,880
[SPEAKER_44]: Judicial Watch then entered the lawsuit alleging a violation of its First Amendment rights.

2822
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:17,311
[SPEAKER_44]: The basis for its claim is the mayor favors one message over another, and that the city does not have any standards or procedures in place.

2823
03:37:18,450 --> 03:37:32,620
[SPEAKER_44]: So I just want to make it be known, Mr. President, I think it's prudent that this council move forward to find out what are the standards and what are the procedures, Mr. President, because clearly anything could be challenged.

2824
03:37:33,060 --> 03:37:42,726
[SPEAKER_44]: And clearly that if we do open up messaging on City Hall, it will open up other First Amendment rights and other concerns.

2825
03:37:43,167 --> 03:37:46,549
[SPEAKER_44]: And I think it's only prudent that we move forward as a community

2826
03:37:47,329 --> 03:37:55,233
[SPEAKER_44]: and make sure that if the mayor decides, and I agree with Councilor Knight, this is totally under the mayor's purview.

2827
03:37:55,594 --> 03:37:57,435
[SPEAKER_44]: This has nothing to do with the council.

2828
03:37:58,015 --> 03:38:07,740
[SPEAKER_44]: And if Councilor Beers wanted to move this forward, for the past six months, he could have approached the mayor at any given time and had that discussion with the mayor.

2829
03:38:08,080 --> 03:38:13,303
[SPEAKER_44]: He opted to come before a body that has no input, and that's his prerogative.

2830
03:38:13,883 --> 03:38:20,109
[SPEAKER_44]: But unless he already approached the mayor, and the mayor denied him of the sign, which I'm not sure.

2831
03:38:20,649 --> 03:38:28,716
[SPEAKER_44]: But clearly, the city administration has control, as well as the building commissioner of the buildings, and it's not the city council.

2832
03:38:29,036 --> 03:38:34,061
[SPEAKER_44]: But I'm willing, Mr. President, to find out what the rules and regulations are and move that forward.

2833
03:38:36,183 --> 03:38:37,144
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2834
03:38:38,225 --> 03:38:40,366
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, we have Councilor Knight and then Councilor Behrs.

2835
03:38:40,387 --> 03:38:40,887
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Knight?

2836
03:38:41,838 --> 03:38:47,223
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, Mr. President, you know, it's not the subject matter of the sign that's the issue.

2837
03:38:47,263 --> 03:38:55,551
[SPEAKER_43]: It's whether or not the City Council wants to be the repository for all the requests of what signs you want to hang on City Hall absent the policy, right?

2838
03:38:56,132 --> 03:38:58,133
[SPEAKER_43]: So, like I said, when's it going to stop?

2839
03:38:58,173 --> 03:39:00,636
[SPEAKER_43]: If it's this today, you know, I'm telling you right now,

2840
03:39:01,291 --> 03:39:05,313
[SPEAKER_43]: We're going to have the police here in a week saying that they want to, uh, police lives matter, sign up there.

2841
03:39:05,333 --> 03:39:08,614
[SPEAKER_43]: And a week after that, they're going to be another organization that says that they want to sign up there.

2842
03:39:09,254 --> 03:39:16,057
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, you know, so it's a slippery slope to go down, Mr. President, you know, um, his city hall is a beautiful historic building.

2843
03:39:16,197 --> 03:39:18,118
[SPEAKER_43]: Uh, what we should be focusing on beautifying it.

2844
03:39:18,478 --> 03:39:18,898
[SPEAKER_43]: You know what I mean?

2845
03:39:18,918 --> 03:39:19,718
[SPEAKER_43]: Not hanging abandons from it.

2846
03:39:19,738 --> 03:39:21,859
[SPEAKER_43]: In my opinion, um, black lives matter.

2847
03:39:22,199 --> 03:39:23,140
[SPEAKER_43]: I have no problem saying it.

2848
03:39:23,780 --> 03:39:26,361
[SPEAKER_43]: Um, but Mr. President, you know, we're a government organization.

2849
03:39:26,381 --> 03:39:28,762
[SPEAKER_43]: We're a government entity and we have to operate like one.

2850
03:39:29,521 --> 03:39:35,104
[SPEAKER_43]: I personally don't wanna sit here every week and debate the merits of what sign they're gonna hang up next on City Hall.

2851
03:39:35,384 --> 03:39:39,066
[SPEAKER_43]: That's a function of the administration and there should be a policy that goes to that effect.

2852
03:39:39,646 --> 03:39:43,748
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, I support the motion made by Councilor Mux.

2853
03:39:44,269 --> 03:39:44,849
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you very much.

2854
03:39:45,229 --> 03:39:46,049
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you Councilor Knight.

2855
03:39:47,070 --> 03:39:49,211
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Beers, I believe you had your hand up next.

2856
03:39:49,751 --> 03:39:50,172
[SPEAKER_37]: Am I correct?

2857
03:39:50,252 --> 03:39:51,832
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, just a couple of things.

2858
03:39:51,952 --> 03:39:58,876
[SPEAKER_29]: I hear you, I'm sure there are thousands of spurious lawsuits filed all the time, judicial watches,

2859
03:39:59,403 --> 03:40:01,204
[SPEAKER_29]: well known as an organization of files, though.

2860
03:40:01,264 --> 03:40:03,424
[SPEAKER_29]: I understand, though, that lawsuits can be filed.

2861
03:40:04,424 --> 03:40:08,606
[SPEAKER_29]: I would just say, I don't think there should be a permitting process for putting banners up on City Hall.

2862
03:40:08,626 --> 03:40:11,346
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that would create the problems that are being brought up here.

2863
03:40:11,366 --> 03:40:14,107
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think this is a slippery slope.

2864
03:40:14,127 --> 03:40:16,068
[SPEAKER_29]: There have been banners hung on the building for years.

2865
03:40:16,568 --> 03:40:25,110
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would just add that if the council doesn't want to be the banner approval authority, then it's on the councilors not to introduce a lot of resolutions about banners.

2866
03:40:25,230 --> 03:40:26,250
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's all I'll say.

2867
03:40:26,290 --> 03:40:27,151
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2868
03:40:27,791 --> 03:40:28,731
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor Beers.

2869
03:40:29,645 --> 03:40:30,586
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions?

2870
03:40:30,626 --> 03:40:32,006
[SPEAKER_37]: Point of information, Mr. President?

2871
03:40:32,287 --> 03:40:34,428
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, you got a point of information from Councilor Marks.

2872
03:40:35,388 --> 03:40:40,331
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President, I did have a resident reach out to me that is employed with the City of Boston.

2873
03:40:41,092 --> 03:40:50,918
[SPEAKER_44]: And they did mention to me that when the City of Boston has a policy in place, that when they put banners up, it's usually a message from the mayor.

2874
03:40:51,718 --> 03:40:53,498
[SPEAKER_44]: And that's how they've been able to work it.

2875
03:40:53,838 --> 03:40:57,959
[SPEAKER_44]: So they put out a message from mayor, whatever it is, and then the message.

2876
03:40:58,640 --> 03:41:01,220
[SPEAKER_44]: And that may be something that could be in a policy.

2877
03:41:01,860 --> 03:41:03,200
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't think anyone's saying no.

2878
03:41:03,521 --> 03:41:06,481
[SPEAKER_44]: I think what we're saying is we'd like to see what the policy is.

2879
03:41:06,941 --> 03:41:12,342
[SPEAKER_44]: And I would disagree with my council colleague if he doesn't think a permit or policy should be in place.

2880
03:41:13,483 --> 03:41:14,663
[SPEAKER_44]: City Hall is one building.

2881
03:41:15,283 --> 03:41:17,423
[SPEAKER_44]: Are we going to do it on the school buildings?

2882
03:41:17,683 --> 03:41:19,124
[SPEAKER_44]: Are we going to do it on the police building?

2883
03:41:19,364 --> 03:41:21,864
[SPEAKER_44]: Are we going to do it in our fire stations, our library?

2884
03:41:22,124 --> 03:41:25,045
[SPEAKER_44]: I mean, we can go through the list of buildings in the city.

2885
03:41:25,825 --> 03:41:32,446
[SPEAKER_44]: So I think it is only prudent to be careful as we move forward, Mr. President.

2886
03:41:33,806 --> 03:41:34,746
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2887
03:41:35,307 --> 03:41:35,987
[SPEAKER_44]: Councilor Pierce?

2888
03:41:36,587 --> 03:41:38,147
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't disagree that we should have a policy.

2889
03:41:38,167 --> 03:41:43,748
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm just saying that if we created an open permit, then we get into these First Amendment questions, which we're currently not facing.

2890
03:41:44,264 --> 03:41:47,406
[SPEAKER_29]: However, the mayor would like to approach this, I'm happy with.

2891
03:41:47,506 --> 03:41:52,910
[SPEAKER_29]: And personally, I would be fine if we hung a Black Lives Matter banner on every municipal building in the city.

2892
03:41:54,452 --> 03:41:55,372
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

2893
03:41:55,893 --> 03:41:57,414
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Carvio, Vice President Carvio.

2894
03:41:57,794 --> 03:41:58,415
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2895
03:41:58,435 --> 03:42:10,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, you know, Councilor Marks brought up a little bit about, it took us four years to move out of the VFW because of a sign where people didn't feel comfortable going in there to vote.

2896
03:42:11,514 --> 03:42:17,917
[SPEAKER_16]: And this council took the correct action and we moved out of there because of the sign that was on that building.

2897
03:42:18,357 --> 03:42:24,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, to put another sign on City Hall, what message do we send the people now?

2898
03:42:26,280 --> 03:42:38,926
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what my concern, Mr. Clerk, if you want to weigh in on this, I mean, you were here when we battled with the VFW to take the All Lives Matter sign down because people weren't comfortable going in there.

2899
03:42:40,526 --> 03:42:46,968
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, that's, again, you know, it goes to the point of who do we offend?

2900
03:42:47,028 --> 03:42:49,589
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we offend everybody with every sign we put up now.

2901
03:42:53,210 --> 03:42:54,430
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Vice President Carriello.

2902
03:42:55,750 --> 03:42:57,591
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions or comments from the council?

2903
03:42:57,611 --> 03:42:57,691
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

2904
03:43:00,852 --> 03:43:04,133
[SPEAKER_37]: There are a number of people that have their hands raised.

2905
03:43:05,893 --> 03:43:07,694
[SPEAKER_37]: So first one would be,

2906
03:43:09,923 --> 03:43:11,605
[SPEAKER_37]: I believe it's Matthew Page Lieberman.

2907
03:43:12,466 --> 03:43:13,807
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address of the record, please.

2908
03:43:14,948 --> 03:43:16,730
[SPEAKER_53]: Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street.

2909
03:43:16,751 --> 03:43:17,251
[SPEAKER_53]: You can hear me?

2910
03:43:17,832 --> 03:43:18,052
[SPEAKER_53]: Yes.

2911
03:43:18,693 --> 03:43:19,173
[SPEAKER_53]: Okay, very good.

2912
03:43:19,814 --> 03:43:29,465
[SPEAKER_53]: I just want to really, I appreciate everybody that has said that they've evolved on this issue over the past few years, especially want to acknowledge Councilor Beers and Councilor Morrell.

2913
03:43:30,305 --> 03:43:38,929
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm not a politician, I'm not an elected office, but my policy tends to be, it's better to ask for forgiveness, you know, than to look before you leap.

2914
03:43:39,229 --> 03:43:42,610
[SPEAKER_53]: Because especially with this council, people could spend months before they set up meetings.

2915
03:43:42,950 --> 03:43:45,852
[SPEAKER_53]: Therefore, I think the people should support this.

2916
03:43:45,872 --> 03:43:46,452
[SPEAKER_53]: You could do both.

2917
03:43:46,892 --> 03:43:49,673
[SPEAKER_53]: You could say, this council, we support that banner.

2918
03:43:49,893 --> 03:43:54,515
[SPEAKER_53]: This council would also like more information about what's acceptable in the future.

2919
03:43:54,756 --> 03:43:55,696
[SPEAKER_53]: But I do have a question.

2920
03:43:55,916 --> 03:43:57,497
[SPEAKER_53]: I just kind of want to understand this resolution.

2921
03:43:58,513 --> 03:44:02,635
[SPEAKER_53]: This council is not voting on if the sign goes there, right?

2922
03:44:03,035 --> 03:44:06,737
[SPEAKER_53]: Or is this council saying we suggest that you put it at City Hall?

2923
03:44:07,598 --> 03:44:08,618
[SPEAKER_53]: Can somebody clarify?

2924
03:44:08,638 --> 03:44:11,560
[SPEAKER_29]: It would be that we suggest or ask the mayor.

2925
03:44:12,060 --> 03:44:13,661
[SPEAKER_53]: There's nothing wrong with that.

2926
03:44:14,001 --> 03:44:15,342
[SPEAKER_53]: There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

2927
03:44:15,362 --> 03:44:20,525
[SPEAKER_53]: There's no violation of any sort of- Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2928
03:44:20,925 --> 03:44:22,366
[SPEAKER_42]: That's not what the resolution says.

2929
03:44:22,726 --> 03:44:24,067
[SPEAKER_42]: It has a directive language in there.

2930
03:44:24,087 --> 03:44:24,647
[SPEAKER_42]: It says, well,

2931
03:44:27,303 --> 03:44:31,407
[SPEAKER_53]: What did he actually say?

2932
03:44:31,427 --> 03:44:36,190
[SPEAKER_43]: The city of Medford will hang a banner reading Black Lives Matter on the front of Medford City Hall.

2933
03:44:37,391 --> 03:44:37,632
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2934
03:44:39,253 --> 03:44:40,694
[SPEAKER_43]: Zach, would you be willing to amend that?

2935
03:44:40,734 --> 03:44:42,235
[SPEAKER_53]: City take this action now.

2936
03:44:43,316 --> 03:44:44,017
[SPEAKER_53]: It says also.

2937
03:44:46,018 --> 03:44:48,460
[SPEAKER_53]: Is there a possibility to amend that and turn it into a suggestion?

2938
03:44:52,143 --> 03:44:55,366
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe that given the fact that, as we've already been told and said,

2939
03:44:56,344 --> 03:45:01,308
[SPEAKER_29]: The mayor has control over the building that functionally the language as existing serves as a suggestion to the mayor.

2940
03:45:02,109 --> 03:45:02,389
[SPEAKER_53]: Okay.

2941
03:45:02,749 --> 03:45:04,931
[SPEAKER_53]: I guess that's an interpretation.

2942
03:45:05,231 --> 03:45:05,592
[SPEAKER_53]: I don't know.

2943
03:45:05,912 --> 03:45:07,553
[SPEAKER_53]: But anyway, I completely support the motion.

2944
03:45:08,574 --> 03:45:10,195
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you so much, Zach and Nicole.

2945
03:45:12,517 --> 03:45:13,498
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2946
03:45:13,778 --> 03:45:15,019
[SPEAKER_41]: Point of clarification, Mr. President.

2947
03:45:15,079 --> 03:45:16,400
[SPEAKER_41]: Point of clarification, Councilman.

2948
03:45:17,041 --> 03:45:22,685
[SPEAKER_41]: Was the sponsor saying that the resolution doesn't mean what it says, or it doesn't say what it means, I guess is the question here.

2949
03:45:24,226 --> 03:45:28,669
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm saying that we will do this, and then it would be, you know, the mayor is the one who makes that choice.

2950
03:45:29,710 --> 03:45:30,671
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for the clarification.

2951
03:45:31,852 --> 03:45:33,693
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2952
03:45:34,054 --> 03:45:37,556
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, we have, next up is Kelly Kuna.

2953
03:45:39,638 --> 03:45:41,059
[SPEAKER_37]: Kelly, name and address of the record, please.

2954
03:45:53,482 --> 03:45:54,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, my name is Kelly Cunha.

2955
03:45:55,043 --> 03:45:56,704
[SPEAKER_13]: I live at 20 Walter Street.

2956
03:45:58,225 --> 03:46:00,167
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just going to read off something.

2957
03:46:00,527 --> 03:46:17,238
[SPEAKER_13]: So while I can truly appreciate the very real and scary threat of the billboard battle zone that Councilor Marks passionately referred to, I think there are some things that are just more important than dissecting the particular messages the city chooses to support and not support.

2958
03:46:17,679 --> 03:46:22,422
[SPEAKER_13]: As of yet, I haven't heard anyone deny that black lives matter or that black folks

2959
03:46:22,802 --> 03:46:32,831
[SPEAKER_13]: have 400 years of receipts of a history previously touched upon by Councilor Morrell that repeatedly showed that their lives have not and do not matter, slavery and Jim Crow to name a few.

2960
03:46:33,431 --> 03:46:50,186
[SPEAKER_13]: And this hanging of a banner is one small, and also if it isn't backed up by real action, totally performative action that we can take as a city to just start the repair of years of damage and harm that has been done to Black folks in this country and in our own city.

2961
03:46:50,646 --> 03:46:56,479
[SPEAKER_13]: And Rick Carvello, you had, uh, Councilor Carvello, you had mentioned that, what kind of message are we sending by hanging this banner up?

2962
03:46:56,499 --> 03:46:57,902
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's pretty clear.

2963
03:46:57,962 --> 03:47:00,528
[SPEAKER_13]: The message is Black Lives Matter.

2964
03:47:01,223 --> 03:47:01,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2965
03:47:02,244 --> 03:47:02,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2966
03:47:03,064 --> 03:47:04,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2967
03:47:05,126 --> 03:47:06,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I support the message.

2968
03:47:07,007 --> 03:47:08,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Hussain, I support the message.

2969
03:47:08,488 --> 03:47:15,132
[SPEAKER_16]: But we've, again, people didn't feel comfortable for going into the VFW to vote with all lives matter.

2970
03:47:15,372 --> 03:47:21,376
[SPEAKER_16]: So do you think people are going to feel uncomfortable walking into City Hall with the sign up?

2971
03:47:21,396 --> 03:47:25,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, it's a slippery slope here that we're going to go down now.

2972
03:47:29,232 --> 03:47:30,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's say it took us four years.

2973
03:47:30,112 --> 03:47:30,913
[SPEAKER_16]: Four years to change.

2974
03:47:30,953 --> 03:47:42,537
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that the message All Lives Matter is a rebuttal to Black Lives Matter, which has been, I mean, I think everyone here has heard the argument of why All Lives Matter is problematic.

2975
03:47:42,577 --> 03:47:48,999
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not going to spend any more labor trying to explain why All Lives Matter is incredibly racist and problematic.

2976
03:47:49,599 --> 03:47:50,939
[SPEAKER_13]: They're two very different things.

2977
03:47:50,999 --> 03:47:55,501
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand what you guys are trying to get at, which is that this is controversial.

2978
03:47:55,541 --> 03:47:58,222
[SPEAKER_13]: But the only people it's really controversial to are racists.

2979
03:47:58,832 --> 03:48:04,034
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm cool with racists being offended by a banner on City Hall.

2980
03:48:04,314 --> 03:48:07,695
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm cool with it, and I hope everyone here that the city voted for.

2981
03:48:07,995 --> 03:48:10,856
[SPEAKER_13]: My daughter is three, and we walk around the city.

2982
03:48:16,645 --> 03:48:19,847
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't know anyone that said that this is controversial, Mr. President.

2983
03:48:20,168 --> 03:48:28,613
[SPEAKER_44]: We're asking that we find out what the policies and procedures as an elected body, Mr. President, it's up to us to do our homework and our due diligence.

2984
03:48:29,033 --> 03:48:34,957
[SPEAKER_44]: And before we just vote on something to vote on it, we should find out what the policies and procedures are.

2985
03:48:35,238 --> 03:48:38,320
[SPEAKER_44]: That's how elected officials act in their course of duty.

2986
03:48:38,640 --> 03:48:43,803
[SPEAKER_44]: So no one is dismissing anything and no one is saying there's no value or merit to this.

2987
03:48:44,144 --> 03:48:46,185
[SPEAKER_44]: We're saying we have to do our due diligence.

2988
03:48:46,965 --> 03:48:50,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Councilor Caviello did just compare All Lives Matter to Black Lives Matter.

2989
03:48:50,867 --> 03:48:52,528
[SPEAKER_16]: I was responding specifically to that.

2990
03:48:52,868 --> 03:48:58,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, I fought diligently to take that sign down up at City Hall for four years.

2991
03:48:59,611 --> 03:49:03,853
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we finally had to move out of there.

2992
03:49:03,933 --> 03:49:07,414
[SPEAKER_16]: I led the charge to take that sign down there with the VFW.

2993
03:49:07,434 --> 03:49:10,316
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, thank you.

2994
03:49:11,687 --> 03:49:12,588
[SPEAKER_37]: Placemakers and caviar.

2995
03:49:13,069 --> 03:49:14,471
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, you've got people that want to speak.

2996
03:49:15,352 --> 03:49:16,073
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see.

2997
03:49:16,373 --> 03:49:19,598
[SPEAKER_37]: Marshall, your next name address for the record.

2998
03:49:21,550 --> 03:49:23,670
[SPEAKER_20]: Marsha Moot no 33 Waterville Road.

2999
03:49:25,531 --> 03:49:27,951
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you all for discussing this.

3000
03:49:28,291 --> 03:49:33,892
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I agree with Mr. Paige Lieberman.

3001
03:49:35,453 --> 03:49:38,133
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that there is precedent.

3002
03:49:38,893 --> 03:49:43,394
[SPEAKER_20]: The council has passed many things that are requesting the mayor to do something.

3003
03:49:45,274 --> 03:49:47,735
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there's no harm in doing that.

3004
03:49:47,955 --> 03:49:48,935
[SPEAKER_20]: I would love if,

3005
03:49:50,905 --> 03:49:54,891
[SPEAKER_20]: Dave Rodriguez from the mayor's office could comment on the process.

3006
03:49:54,931 --> 03:49:59,859
[SPEAKER_20]: For example, the I think it's the high school graduation congrats banner.

3007
03:49:59,979 --> 03:50:01,081
[SPEAKER_20]: How did that get up there.

3008
03:50:01,101 --> 03:50:01,322
[SPEAKER_20]: I think

3009
03:50:03,707 --> 03:50:12,076
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, those types of community, uh, uplifting and solidarity, uh, banners belong on city hall.

3010
03:50:12,897 --> 03:50:20,605
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, and so I really appreciate this motion, uh, to recommend to the mayor that, uh, her office hangs this banner.

3011
03:50:21,566 --> 03:50:22,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Marshall.

3012
03:50:22,146 --> 03:50:24,188
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

3013
03:50:24,268 --> 03:50:25,790
[SPEAKER_37]: Uh, Dave, did you want to comment on that?

3014
03:50:29,625 --> 03:50:35,649
[SPEAKER_58]: As far as I'm aware, there's no formal policy that's in place that governs the placement of a banner on the front of City Hall.

3015
03:50:36,550 --> 03:50:37,571
[SPEAKER_58]: I can certainly look into it.

3016
03:50:37,731 --> 03:50:39,692
[SPEAKER_58]: It's mostly just on past practice.

3017
03:50:40,393 --> 03:50:44,496
[SPEAKER_58]: But we can certainly look in and dig in a little bit to see if there's ever been a formal policy in place.

3018
03:50:44,536 --> 03:50:46,938
[SPEAKER_58]: But as I'm aware, there is not one as of now.

3019
03:50:49,700 --> 03:50:50,200
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Dave.

3020
03:50:51,261 --> 03:50:52,341
[SPEAKER_42]: Point of information, Mr. President.

3021
03:50:52,542 --> 03:50:53,622
[SPEAKER_36]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

3022
03:50:54,163 --> 03:50:58,566
[SPEAKER_43]: I do believe the informal policy of previous administration was only city-sponsored events.

3023
03:50:58,933 --> 03:51:05,137
[SPEAKER_43]: if I'm not mistaken, but that might need to be clarified, but I think that was the ad hoc policy that was adopted by the previous administration.

3024
03:51:08,659 --> 03:51:09,399
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3025
03:51:09,419 --> 03:51:16,143
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, let's see, Joanna, name and address for the record, please.

3026
03:51:18,525 --> 03:51:22,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Joanna Quintero Mejia, 35 Early Ave, Medford.

3027
03:51:23,388 --> 03:51:25,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Falco.

3028
03:51:26,021 --> 03:51:34,747
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you to all the counselors, actually, because what I hear from all of them, I think, is that they understand that black lives matter.

3029
03:51:35,908 --> 03:51:42,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's very important that we support our people of color and the black people in Medford.

3030
03:51:43,053 --> 03:51:53,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I would just like to point out that Councilor Marks spoke of Washington, D.C., and maybe the mayor could reach out to Somerville and Arlington's mayors

3031
03:51:53,609 --> 03:51:58,830
[SPEAKER_06]: because they both have a banner on their city halls that reads Black Lives Matter.

3032
03:51:59,590 --> 03:52:00,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'll leave it there.

3033
03:52:00,370 --> 03:52:01,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I am for the banner.

3034
03:52:01,631 --> 03:52:02,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like the banner to be hung.

3035
03:52:03,291 --> 03:52:03,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3036
03:52:04,251 --> 03:52:04,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3037
03:52:04,611 --> 03:52:13,173
[SPEAKER_38]: Alyssa, name and address of the record, please.

3038
03:52:13,773 --> 03:52:15,933
[SPEAKER_66]: Hi, my name is Alyssa Lodato.

3039
03:52:16,013 --> 03:52:18,714
[SPEAKER_66]: I live at 74 Marion Street in Medford.

3040
03:52:20,355 --> 03:52:25,397
[SPEAKER_66]: I want to thank Zach for raising this issue and starting this conversation.

3041
03:52:25,417 --> 03:52:32,000
[SPEAKER_66]: I think it's a really important one and I support hanging the banner.

3042
03:52:32,020 --> 03:52:35,961
[SPEAKER_66]: I know some of our adjoining towns do as well.

3043
03:52:36,421 --> 03:52:40,363
[SPEAKER_66]: And it doesn't feel like at this time you guys are

3044
03:52:41,345 --> 03:52:46,747
[SPEAKER_66]: voting to hang the banner just to support the hanging of the banner.

3045
03:52:46,887 --> 03:52:54,170
[SPEAKER_66]: So I don't see that it's this huge thing that involves like policy and rules.

3046
03:52:54,230 --> 03:52:55,770
[SPEAKER_66]: If you support it, then do that.

3047
03:52:55,870 --> 03:52:57,031
[SPEAKER_66]: And if you don't, then don't.

3048
03:52:57,851 --> 03:52:59,672
[SPEAKER_66]: Vote your conscience and do you.

3049
03:53:00,492 --> 03:53:03,913
[SPEAKER_66]: And that's all we can ask of our elected officials.

3050
03:53:03,933 --> 03:53:05,034
[SPEAKER_66]: So figure out

3051
03:53:05,914 --> 03:53:07,395
[SPEAKER_66]: what that means to you and do that thing.

3052
03:53:08,376 --> 03:53:12,680
[SPEAKER_66]: But I personally am in support and I want to thank you for even having this conversation.

3053
03:53:13,300 --> 03:53:23,168
[SPEAKER_66]: I think it's important that we're having it, that we're publicly having it, and that some people are happy to make their opinions known.

3054
03:53:23,889 --> 03:53:25,530
[SPEAKER_66]: So thank you very much for your time.

3055
03:53:26,351 --> 03:53:26,891
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Lisa.

3056
03:53:26,931 --> 03:53:32,976
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, we have

3057
03:53:34,972 --> 03:53:38,695
[SPEAKER_35]: I apologize if I get this wrong, Tayani Goulart?

3058
03:53:40,897 --> 03:53:42,058
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address the record, please.

3059
03:53:42,838 --> 03:53:44,920
[SPEAKER_34]: Tayani Goulart, High Street in Medford.

3060
03:53:46,041 --> 03:53:54,788
[SPEAKER_34]: So I would like to start off by just thanking Councilor Behrs and Councilor Morrell in speaking out, and I would like to speak out in my support of hanging a Black Lives Matter sign.

3061
03:53:55,749 --> 03:54:02,494
[SPEAKER_34]: So my position is that I definitely appreciate City Council's position in wanting to follow

3062
03:54:03,095 --> 03:54:07,538
[SPEAKER_34]: certain procedures in terms of hierarchy or actions or processes.

3063
03:54:08,038 --> 03:54:19,525
[SPEAKER_34]: And I would like to challenge and remind that a lot of our procedures and policies are built under systemic racism and white supremacy in our country, in our communities, in the city and state that we live in.

3064
03:54:19,845 --> 03:54:26,749
[SPEAKER_34]: So I would ask that at this point, along with this conversation, we also talk about how these

3065
03:54:28,379 --> 03:54:37,602
[SPEAKER_34]: how the process of checking, double-checking, and clarifying things is part of an oppressive system and part of delaying things for folks.

3066
03:54:37,842 --> 03:54:40,463
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just really wanted to take the opportunity to point that out.

3067
03:54:41,424 --> 03:54:53,708
[SPEAKER_34]: And the question about what message are we sending to voters, I also think that it's really important to say that what we're saying is Black Lives Matter, and it's really important to stand on a position.

3068
03:54:54,827 --> 03:54:58,209
[SPEAKER_34]: So I fully support this, and I really appreciate everybody that's speaking out.

3069
03:54:59,309 --> 03:54:59,629
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

3070
03:55:02,371 --> 03:55:04,011
[SPEAKER_37]: Rick Orlando, did you want to speak on this?

3071
03:55:10,695 --> 03:55:11,215
[SPEAKER_37]: Rick Orlando?

3072
03:55:11,895 --> 03:55:12,676
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, John.

3073
03:55:14,275 --> 03:55:18,820
[SPEAKER_47]: Council President and other Councilors, thank you for your discussions tonight.

3074
03:55:19,621 --> 03:55:32,454
[SPEAKER_47]: As I listened to Councilor Mox, I think he was very sincere and I didn't detect in his statements a feeling of discomfort with the Black Lives Matter banner.

3075
03:55:32,835 --> 03:55:35,037
[SPEAKER_47]: I think what he's just making a point is that

3076
03:55:36,064 --> 03:55:41,989
[SPEAKER_47]: There needs to be an understanding of how we proceed forward as other requests come up.

3077
03:55:42,669 --> 03:55:53,658
[SPEAKER_47]: I've heard over the past week, people talking about other types of banners and they don't need to elaborate on all the different types, but they have many different political positions and various things of that nature.

3078
03:55:54,339 --> 03:56:04,167
[SPEAKER_47]: And putting the city administration to be the arbitrator of which ones should be put up and which ones should not can cause problems.

3079
03:56:04,827 --> 03:56:05,788
[SPEAKER_47]: So I think

3080
03:56:06,161 --> 03:56:12,025
[SPEAKER_47]: Some of the points that Council March brought up, I think he was sincere, as I said, on his support of Black Lives Matter.

3081
03:56:12,665 --> 03:56:22,632
[SPEAKER_47]: I think it's just a case of understanding how we move forward so this doesn't become problematic for the city and for the residents of the community.

3082
03:56:23,393 --> 03:56:23,713
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3083
03:56:24,513 --> 03:56:24,874
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3084
03:56:24,894 --> 03:56:31,278
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, Dana Ruffin?

3085
03:56:33,399 --> 03:56:34,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, yes.

3086
03:56:34,780 --> 03:56:35,941
[SPEAKER_35]: Address for the record, please.

3087
03:56:36,940 --> 03:56:38,902
[SPEAKER_24]: Dana Rockman, Pitcher Ave, Medford.

3088
03:56:38,922 --> 03:56:39,562
[SPEAKER_24]: Can you hear me?

3089
03:56:40,123 --> 03:56:42,185
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

3090
03:56:42,245 --> 03:56:45,328
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Falco.

3091
03:56:45,348 --> 03:56:47,930
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you to all the council members who have spoken.

3092
03:56:50,139 --> 03:56:57,143
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I think that one thing that I've been, I have a Black Lives Matter sign, or I had a Black Lives Matter sign in my front yard.

3093
03:56:57,163 --> 03:56:58,724
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been stolen twice, right?

3094
03:56:59,045 --> 03:57:01,826
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a Black Lives Matter sign, I think it's on Route 16.

3095
03:57:02,127 --> 03:57:03,628
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been defaced a bunch of times.

3096
03:57:04,548 --> 03:57:09,672
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I think the one thing that's poignant is that, you know, every time that sign gets stolen, I'm gonna put it back up.

3097
03:57:09,712 --> 03:57:10,912
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's not really about me.

3098
03:57:11,353 --> 03:57:16,616
[SPEAKER_24]: It's about the message that there are people in our community who are through those actions saying, no, they don't, right?

3099
03:57:17,157 --> 03:57:18,638
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I think that as a community,

3100
03:57:19,538 --> 03:57:22,942
[SPEAKER_24]: If our mayor, if our building, we say, yeah, they do, right?

3101
03:57:23,002 --> 03:57:28,267
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's, and I, you know, I think that I hear there's this concern about regulations and other

3102
03:57:29,608 --> 03:57:34,409
[SPEAKER_24]: you know, other organizations that may want to hang signs.

3103
03:57:35,229 --> 03:57:36,950
[SPEAKER_24]: Arlington is dealing with that issue.

3104
03:57:37,190 --> 03:57:38,710
[SPEAKER_24]: Somerville is dealing with that issue.

3105
03:57:38,830 --> 03:57:41,551
[SPEAKER_24]: Fenway Park is dealing with that issue on the side of the Mass Pike.

3106
03:57:41,951 --> 03:57:46,192
[SPEAKER_24]: And if they can cope with these things, I'm thinking we could probably figure it out as well.

3107
03:57:46,732 --> 03:57:48,153
[SPEAKER_24]: I have, I have faith in us.

3108
03:57:49,453 --> 03:57:53,554
[SPEAKER_24]: And lastly, I think I just, I just want to say, you know, I think that right now we're at a critical

3109
03:57:54,334 --> 03:57:55,275
[SPEAKER_24]: We're at a critical point.

3110
03:57:56,055 --> 03:58:01,118
[SPEAKER_24]: COVID has really shined some huge lights on some of the inequity in our country.

3111
03:58:01,198 --> 03:58:09,842
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that I would ask the council members to think about how they imagine themselves at these critical points in history.

3112
03:58:10,202 --> 03:58:12,523
[SPEAKER_24]: How do you imagine you would have reacted to segregation?

3113
03:58:12,843 --> 03:58:14,384
[SPEAKER_24]: Which side do you think you would have been on?

3114
03:58:15,044 --> 03:58:18,246
[SPEAKER_24]: And I ask you that because I think that that's where we are.

3115
03:58:18,706 --> 03:58:20,547
[SPEAKER_24]: And where do you want to be in history?

3116
03:58:20,607 --> 03:58:21,947
[SPEAKER_24]: How do you want to be remembered?

3117
03:58:22,008 --> 03:58:23,428
[SPEAKER_24]: What side do you want to have voted on?

3118
03:58:23,768 --> 03:58:24,769
[SPEAKER_24]: And yes, it's a banner.

3119
03:58:24,789 --> 03:58:27,450
[SPEAKER_24]: It's completely symbolic.

3120
03:58:28,150 --> 03:58:30,251
[SPEAKER_24]: But in some ways, it's saying a lot more.

3121
03:58:30,511 --> 03:58:31,012
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you.

3122
03:58:31,052 --> 03:58:31,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your time.

3123
03:58:32,112 --> 03:58:32,452
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3124
03:58:35,594 --> 03:58:39,695
[SPEAKER_33]: We have Kit Collins.

3125
03:58:39,976 --> 03:58:41,576
[SPEAKER_33]: Name and address of the record, please.

3126
03:58:44,958 --> 03:58:45,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi there.

3127
03:58:45,939 --> 03:58:47,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my name is Collins.

3128
03:58:47,580 --> 03:58:50,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I live at 42 William Street in South Medford.

3129
03:58:51,203 --> 03:58:52,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to everybody who's spoken so far.

3130
03:58:52,685 --> 03:58:55,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to Councilor Behrs for bringing this resolution.

3131
03:58:55,387 --> 03:59:00,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I too support the motion to hang a banner reading Black Lives Matter on City Hall.

3132
03:59:01,432 --> 03:59:07,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to echo some of the sentiments that have already been stated, but just to reinforce them with my voice, I believe that this is not a political statement.

3133
03:59:07,817 --> 03:59:09,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a statement in support of

3134
03:59:09,790 --> 03:59:15,754
[SPEAKER_03]: basic civil rights and the right of every person to enjoy freedom and safety in their community.

3135
03:59:15,935 --> 03:59:23,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that when we say Black Lives Matter, we're affirming in some way, you know, the same values that we affirm when we lobby the city council for safer streets.

3136
03:59:24,681 --> 03:59:32,227
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an affirmation that we're not okay with the fact that for some people, because of the color of their skin, their life is more difficult, it's more precarious, more dangerous for them.

3137
03:59:33,328 --> 03:59:39,132
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an affirmation that we are not okay with that being the case for anybody in the country or any of our neighbors here in Medford.

3138
03:59:39,978 --> 03:59:46,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an affirmation that we are a city where we want everybody to enjoy freedom, joy, safety, security.

3139
03:59:47,484 --> 03:59:57,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And to the point that, you know, I think that there are concerns about this message being controversial, it being provocative, it making certain residents feel uncomfortable.

3140
03:59:57,131 --> 04:00:07,038
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would say to those people and to anybody who's hearing from their constituents those concerns, if you think that Black Lives Matter means that white lives don't matter or that they matter less,

3141
04:00:08,118 --> 04:00:09,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can just read up on it.

3142
04:00:09,379 --> 04:00:14,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Google the movement for black lives and like read over the website because that's really not what it means.

3143
04:00:15,082 --> 04:00:19,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And anybody who takes that kind of issue from this language is simply misinformed.

3144
04:00:20,104 --> 04:00:20,945
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really simple.

3145
04:00:21,085 --> 04:00:22,125
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about civil rights.

3146
04:00:23,046 --> 04:00:25,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the language of a movement for civil rights.

3147
04:00:25,667 --> 04:00:29,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to live in a city where we're not afraid to voice our support for that.

3148
04:00:30,049 --> 04:00:33,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I want us to back it up with real substantive action.

3149
04:00:33,511 --> 04:00:35,632
[SPEAKER_03]: But like Nicole said, and a lot of people after her,

3150
04:00:36,972 --> 04:00:39,754
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to do the simple language thing first.

3151
04:00:40,394 --> 04:00:41,795
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we got to prove that we can do that.

3152
04:00:42,155 --> 04:00:42,935
[SPEAKER_03]: It's simple to do that.

3153
04:00:43,075 --> 04:00:43,596
[SPEAKER_03]: We should do it.

3154
04:00:44,196 --> 04:00:44,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.

3155
04:00:44,616 --> 04:00:46,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let's get on to the harder, more important stuff.

3156
04:00:47,337 --> 04:00:47,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

3157
04:00:47,517 --> 04:00:48,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Kit.

3158
04:00:49,298 --> 04:00:52,120
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's see, we have Sherry Foley.

3159
04:00:52,560 --> 04:00:53,680
[SPEAKER_32]: Name and address the record, please.

3160
04:01:00,644 --> 04:01:01,584
[SPEAKER_32]: Sherry, we can't hear you.

3161
04:01:07,250 --> 04:01:07,890
[SPEAKER_38]: We can't hear you.

3162
04:01:12,233 --> 04:01:15,175
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. President, we do have 15 additional items on the agenda as well.

3163
04:01:16,056 --> 04:01:16,196
[SPEAKER_37]: Yep.

3164
04:01:17,357 --> 04:01:21,719
[SPEAKER_37]: Sherry, what I'm going to do is I'm going to move on to someone else, and I'll come back to you in a minute.

3165
04:01:21,739 --> 04:01:25,242
[SPEAKER_37]: We'll try to see if we can hear you.

3166
04:01:26,943 --> 04:01:27,223
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see.

3167
04:01:27,243 --> 04:01:29,324
[SPEAKER_37]: We have Eileen Lerner.

3168
04:01:30,445 --> 04:01:31,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record, please.

3169
04:01:34,372 --> 04:01:38,515
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Eileen Lerner and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford.

3170
04:01:39,216 --> 04:01:47,742
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanted to say that you all began this meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance in which you say, with liberty and justice for all.

3171
04:01:48,723 --> 04:01:49,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't you?

3172
04:01:50,273 --> 04:01:59,255
[SPEAKER_12]: And what is Black Lives Matter saying except that black people should be included in the idea of liberty and justice for all.

3173
04:01:59,395 --> 04:02:06,416
[SPEAKER_12]: And we all know, we all know that black people have not been included in that vision of America.

3174
04:02:06,936 --> 04:02:11,537
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what this is saying is that we want them to be included.

3175
04:02:11,957 --> 04:02:13,237
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to love them.

3176
04:02:13,598 --> 04:02:15,578
[SPEAKER_12]: This message is about love.

3177
04:02:16,358 --> 04:02:25,062
[SPEAKER_12]: And if people are uncomfortable with this message, if they think it's controversial, well, I don't know what to say to them.

3178
04:02:25,142 --> 04:02:40,010
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they have a lot of work to do to educate themselves, because what they should be uncomfortable with is the horrible treatment that Black people have been getting since this country became the United States of America.

3179
04:02:41,027 --> 04:02:49,771
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanna say that I wholeheartedly support putting the banner on every public building if we could, but certainly the city hall.

3180
04:02:50,831 --> 04:02:55,133
[SPEAKER_12]: It declares a moral message that we all need to know.

3181
04:02:56,093 --> 04:03:04,797
[SPEAKER_12]: And it includes everybody in the city instead of, you know, liberty and justice for all shouldn't just mean for white people.

3182
04:03:05,737 --> 04:03:09,579
[SPEAKER_12]: A welcoming city shouldn't just mean welcoming for white men.

3183
04:03:10,580 --> 04:03:13,521
[SPEAKER_12]: We need liberty and justice for all.

3184
04:03:14,022 --> 04:03:15,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Black Lives Matter.

3185
04:03:15,242 --> 04:03:16,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Hang the banner.

3186
04:03:18,184 --> 04:03:18,744
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Emily.

3187
04:03:18,764 --> 04:03:23,286
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, let's see.

3188
04:03:29,790 --> 04:03:32,251
[SPEAKER_37]: Anthony D'Antonio, name and address of the record, please.

3189
04:03:37,014 --> 04:03:41,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Anthony D'Antonio, Hicks Avenue, directly across the street from the Columbus School.

3190
04:03:43,238 --> 04:03:51,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I simply request that you reject the hanging of not just this, but any and all political banners and or flags on Medford City Hall.

3191
04:03:52,044 --> 04:03:55,146
[SPEAKER_05]: There should only be one flag flying on City Hall grounds.

3192
04:03:55,807 --> 04:03:58,509
[SPEAKER_05]: One nation under God with liberty and justice for all.

3193
04:03:59,069 --> 04:04:04,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad to say in the current cultural and political climate, there may soon be a resolution to remove it.

3194
04:04:05,307 --> 04:04:11,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I would hope to hear a counter-resolution declaring a prohibition of any and all political banners on City Hall.

3195
04:04:11,989 --> 04:04:14,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And Black Lives Matter is a political movement.

3196
04:04:15,350 --> 04:04:23,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. King never demonized the most egregious segregationists, nor did he condemn all white people and demand fealty at any cost.

3197
04:04:24,172 --> 04:04:26,512
[SPEAKER_05]: He did not espouse destruction of the country.

3198
04:04:26,913 --> 04:04:32,334
[SPEAKER_05]: He sought to uplift it in the face of physical assault, threats, incarceration,

3199
04:04:32,782 --> 04:04:35,203
[SPEAKER_05]: in the deaths of civil rights volunteers.

3200
04:04:35,543 --> 04:04:45,568
[SPEAKER_05]: He endured and prevailed in uniting Americans of every race to join his civil rights movement, all done peacefully, unlike what is going on today.

3201
04:04:46,268 --> 04:04:53,052
[SPEAKER_05]: At the very least, the resolution should be tabled until citizens are allowed to voice their opinions in person at a meeting.

3202
04:04:53,712 --> 04:04:59,615
[SPEAKER_05]: City Hall should be the landmark for all of Medford's citizens without favoritism shown to one group over another.

3203
04:05:00,275 --> 04:05:02,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Please leave that building unadorned.

3204
04:05:02,597 --> 04:05:16,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Every citizen in Medford has the right to exercise the First Amendment right to free speech at City Hall, whether in the form of protests and rallies outside the building or in attending city council and school committee meetings inside the building.

3205
04:05:16,543 --> 04:05:30,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do not capitulate to those who are intent on dividing residents of Medford into those who support their socialist progressive ideology and those who do not, labeling and harassing those who disagree as racist.

3206
04:05:30,888 --> 04:05:32,189
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not progress.

3207
04:05:32,622 --> 04:05:33,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3208
04:05:33,703 --> 04:05:35,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3209
04:05:36,005 --> 04:05:37,566
[SPEAKER_37]: I want to remind everyone.

3210
04:05:38,547 --> 04:05:39,508
[SPEAKER_37]: Everyone's been pretty good.

3211
04:05:39,548 --> 04:05:42,210
[SPEAKER_37]: So I want to just remind everybody, you have a minute and a half to speak.

3212
04:05:43,151 --> 04:05:44,572
[SPEAKER_37]: So that's just a reminder.

3213
04:05:44,772 --> 04:05:46,554
[SPEAKER_37]: Everyone's been pretty good about staying to that.

3214
04:05:46,914 --> 04:05:48,736
[SPEAKER_37]: Counselor Beers, I believe I heard your voice.

3215
04:05:49,477 --> 04:05:49,817
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3216
04:05:49,837 --> 04:05:51,438
[SPEAKER_29]: Just a short message.

3217
04:05:51,478 --> 04:05:55,702
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to read from the letter from the Birmingham jail by Dr. King, which is,

3218
04:05:56,277 --> 04:06:16,793
[SPEAKER_29]: I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride towards freedom is not the white citizen's counselor or the Ku Klux Klan-er, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to order than to justice, who prefers a negative peace, which is the absence of tension, to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice, and who constantly says, I agree with you and the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods.

3219
04:06:17,154 --> 04:06:20,056
[SPEAKER_29]: So let's not talk about Dr. King in such a way.

3220
04:06:20,216 --> 04:06:21,117
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3221
04:06:21,437 --> 04:06:22,838
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Counselor Barrett.

3222
04:06:23,699 --> 04:06:24,420
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's see.

3223
04:06:25,902 --> 04:06:28,105
[SPEAKER_35]: Jennifer Kerwood, name and address the record, please.

3224
04:06:28,125 --> 04:06:29,187
[SPEAKER_35]: You have a minute and a half.

3225
04:06:30,348 --> 04:06:32,451
[SPEAKER_27]: Jennifer Kerwood, 43 Willis Avenue.

3226
04:06:32,612 --> 04:06:35,115
[SPEAKER_27]: I just want to state that the mayor herself

3227
04:06:36,024 --> 04:06:43,649
[SPEAKER_27]: has declared racism a public health crisis, and therefore this is not political.

3228
04:06:44,270 --> 04:06:54,197
[SPEAKER_27]: If there were other things that were put up in order to pass information regarding other health issues or things like that, I think no one would have any issue with it.

3229
04:06:54,397 --> 04:07:05,145
[SPEAKER_27]: So given that, let's forget the fact, this isn't political, this is about community, and that is what y'all have been, you're supposed to be representing us.

3230
04:07:05,985 --> 04:07:07,166
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that's all I just want to say.

3231
04:07:07,566 --> 04:07:13,470
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm in support of the banner, or at least what's happening is a request for the banner, just to clarify.

3232
04:07:15,251 --> 04:07:15,611
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

3233
04:07:16,172 --> 04:07:16,872
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you very much.

3234
04:07:20,434 --> 04:07:22,075
[SPEAKER_37]: See, Sherry, we're gonna try you again.

3235
04:07:22,095 --> 04:07:24,317
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, Sherry.

3236
04:07:25,558 --> 04:07:26,399
[SPEAKER_37]: You have a minute and a half.

3237
04:07:26,479 --> 04:07:27,299
[SPEAKER_37]: I just unmuted you.

3238
04:07:27,439 --> 04:07:28,000
[SPEAKER_17]: You got me?

3239
04:07:28,260 --> 04:07:28,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?

3240
04:07:29,160 --> 04:07:29,741
[SPEAKER_37]: Fire away.

3241
04:07:30,401 --> 04:07:30,761
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

3242
04:07:30,821 --> 04:07:33,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Sherry Foley, 69 Linwood Street.

3243
04:07:33,763 --> 04:07:40,088
[SPEAKER_17]: I, too, was also going to mention how this has been declared a health crisis by city officials.

3244
04:07:41,649 --> 04:07:47,853
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a little different than a pro-life banner or a Second Amendment right or something along those lines.

3245
04:07:48,473 --> 04:07:55,879
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think everyone is tending that are so against it, they're confusing the message with the organization.

3246
04:07:56,600 --> 04:08:08,970
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, if people have such an issue with Black Lives Matter, what I always prefer, since it kind of dumbs things down for some people, it's something along the lines of, all lives can't matter until Black Lives Matter.

3247
04:08:09,490 --> 04:08:13,214
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, something needs to be said instead of,

3248
04:08:14,551 --> 04:08:18,695
[SPEAKER_17]: saying the right thing and then moving along with the same course of action.

3249
04:08:18,715 --> 04:08:22,258
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that's just the reality of the world we're living in.

3250
04:08:22,378 --> 04:08:24,399
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's all I have to say about that.

3251
04:08:25,060 --> 04:08:25,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

3252
04:08:25,921 --> 04:08:26,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

3253
04:08:26,321 --> 04:08:33,287
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's see, here we have Rebecca Schmeling.

3254
04:08:51,621 --> 04:08:52,041
[SPEAKER_55]: Rebecca?

3255
04:09:04,947 --> 04:09:06,048
[SPEAKER_35]: I lost Rebecca, sorry.

3256
04:09:06,548 --> 04:09:08,389
[SPEAKER_35]: Rebecca, if you could raise your hand again, I'm sorry.

3257
04:09:14,812 --> 04:09:17,573
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, we'll move on to Derek Anderson.

3258
04:09:20,745 --> 04:09:21,045
[SPEAKER_31]: Hello?

3259
04:09:21,686 --> 04:09:24,571
[SPEAKER_37]: I just found her and unmuted her.

3260
04:09:24,611 --> 04:09:28,757
[SPEAKER_37]: Rebecca, we'll go with Rebecca Schmeling and then we'll go to Derek Anderson.

3261
04:09:28,878 --> 04:09:29,879
[SPEAKER_37]: Rebecca Schmeling, you're on.

3262
04:09:29,899 --> 04:09:30,861
[SPEAKER_37]: You have a minute and a half.

3263
04:09:31,482 --> 04:09:31,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

3264
04:09:33,368 --> 04:09:35,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebecca Schmeling, I live on Salem Street in Medford.

3265
04:09:36,530 --> 04:09:41,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to kind of address the idea of a slippery slope that's been brought up.

3266
04:09:42,614 --> 04:09:46,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you go back in history, you could have made that argument for a lot of things.

3267
04:09:47,216 --> 04:09:54,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when our country was founded, saying that women should vote was pretty slippery, slopey, and controversial.

3268
04:09:54,781 --> 04:10:00,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we've moved forward, you know, Martin Luther King also said the arc of justice

3269
04:10:01,685 --> 04:10:30,497
[SPEAKER_01]: uh... bands up and sell it you know i'd like to think that where adding it's you what we don't consider to be controversial and you know if you want to go down the slippery slope of putting other banners that those people who have been oppressed for hundreds of thousands of years like you know but native american rights on city hall i'm happy to go down that slippery slope with you uh... i'd just think that you know you can't make the argument that it's a slippery slope because if you haven't actual

3270
04:10:31,277 --> 04:10:37,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Grievance like black people in this country do it's not the same as if you just have a political idea.

3271
04:10:37,963 --> 04:10:43,549
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I say politics in college, the politics is personal.

3272
04:10:43,649 --> 04:10:50,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to talk about how black lives matter is politics, everything is politics politics affects everything we do.

3273
04:10:51,055 --> 04:10:52,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything the mayor does is political.

3274
04:10:53,256 --> 04:11:01,518
[SPEAKER_01]: So putting a sign supporting the black people in our community is not going to make anything more political than it already is.

3275
04:11:02,438 --> 04:11:04,198
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, I think I have a couple more seconds.

3276
04:11:04,258 --> 04:11:10,420
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing we're talking a lot about how people didn't elect, you know, the mayor and the counselors to be

3277
04:11:11,721 --> 04:11:15,703
[SPEAKER_01]: political or controversial, we elect people to do things, not to not do things.

3278
04:11:15,883 --> 04:11:18,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, this is a way to actually do something.

3279
04:11:18,865 --> 04:11:20,566
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for your time.

3280
04:11:21,086 --> 04:11:21,726
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much.

3281
04:11:22,867 --> 04:11:23,607
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's see.

3282
04:11:34,833 --> 04:11:36,593
[SPEAKER_54]: I think I'm still unmuted.

3283
04:11:37,274 --> 04:11:38,514
[SPEAKER_35]: Derek Anderson, you're up next.

3284
04:11:38,554 --> 04:11:39,795
[SPEAKER_35]: Name and address for the record, please.

3285
04:11:40,869 --> 04:11:42,450
[SPEAKER_54]: Derek Anderson, 16 Myrtle Street.

3286
04:11:42,490 --> 04:11:44,311
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3287
04:11:44,992 --> 04:11:45,792
[SPEAKER_54]: I'll try to be quick.

3288
04:11:46,212 --> 04:11:54,477
[SPEAKER_54]: I, first of all, support the recommendation or hanging up the Black Lives Matter sign on City Hall.

3289
04:11:55,058 --> 04:11:57,779
[SPEAKER_54]: I hear what some of the councilors are saying.

3290
04:11:57,899 --> 04:12:05,824
[SPEAKER_54]: I would certainly support the mayor's office creating a policy which, you know, which

3291
04:12:06,641 --> 04:12:15,105
[SPEAKER_54]: tries to prevent the worst of such signs that would actually make City Hall a place that's not welcoming for folks.

3292
04:12:15,845 --> 04:12:17,446
[SPEAKER_54]: I certainly encourage that to be done.

3293
04:12:17,966 --> 04:12:22,067
[SPEAKER_54]: What I would strongly encourage of City Council is that we move quickly.

3294
04:12:22,087 --> 04:12:24,448
[SPEAKER_54]: This is an important moment for civil rights.

3295
04:12:24,528 --> 04:12:32,732
[SPEAKER_54]: This is a long overdue moment, and this is not something to let sit and push around to other people and say it's not our problem.

3296
04:12:32,872 --> 04:12:35,133
[SPEAKER_54]: Let's do the best we can with getting a policy in place.

3297
04:12:35,754 --> 04:12:37,676
[SPEAKER_54]: and let's get that sign up there quickly.

3298
04:12:39,298 --> 04:12:39,899
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Darren.

3299
04:12:39,999 --> 04:12:44,143
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, we have, let's see.

3300
04:12:52,613 --> 04:12:55,016
[SPEAKER_37]: MC, name and address for the record.

3301
04:12:56,244 --> 04:12:59,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, this is Grace Caldera from my husband's account.

3302
04:12:59,485 --> 04:13:01,126
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm at 33 Governors Up.

3303
04:13:03,387 --> 04:13:20,954
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to take a brief minute to say that I am obviously a black citizen of Medford and it's really disheartening as a black person living in Medford that we're having this discussion about whether or not to put a banner

3304
04:13:21,514 --> 04:13:35,019
[SPEAKER_18]: on a public place in somewhere prominent that says that I, as a citizen, and other Black people matter to this city and to our country.

3305
04:13:35,619 --> 04:13:39,241
[SPEAKER_18]: And this debate is going on as if

3306
04:13:40,808 --> 04:13:55,524
[SPEAKER_18]: We are debating my humanity and whether or not I have the ability to live in such a city where people are okay with saying that I matter, my family matters.

3307
04:13:56,205 --> 04:13:58,428
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just wanted to say,

3308
04:14:00,734 --> 04:14:11,440
[SPEAKER_18]: just wanted to appear before you to have you hear this, because to me, the banner is a symbol, but it means so much more than that.

3309
04:14:12,020 --> 04:14:17,283
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wish that you could all understand this and feel it the way I do.

3310
04:14:20,285 --> 04:14:20,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

3311
04:14:20,685 --> 04:14:27,089
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, let's see.

3312
04:14:27,989 --> 04:14:29,390
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, any other questions or comments?

3313
04:14:33,443 --> 04:14:37,544
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President.

3314
04:14:37,584 --> 04:14:39,825
[SPEAKER_49]: Let me, let me, uh, thank you, Mr. President.

3315
04:14:40,365 --> 04:14:44,686
[SPEAKER_49]: This is difficult doing, uh, our meetings and zoom by phone.

3316
04:14:45,086 --> 04:14:45,786
[SPEAKER_49]: It's terrible.

3317
04:14:45,846 --> 04:14:50,768
[SPEAKER_49]: So you don't want to at times that someone's speaking, you have a difficult time to try to jump in.

3318
04:14:51,328 --> 04:15:02,271
[SPEAKER_49]: So I, I appreciate, and I understand the black lives matter, uh, statement and it means so much because as I talked about

3319
04:15:03,047 --> 04:15:25,195
[SPEAKER_49]: uh... and many meetings the the discussion that i've had with my my friends uh... of color and talking to my uh... uh... black colleagues in and and former players in players in talking about you know the the actual black lives matter uh... banner it it it's funny how

3320
04:15:26,067 --> 04:15:47,566
[SPEAKER_49]: You can hear, I forgot, I apologize, the last speaker who just spoke, you can hear the intense hurt in her voice and that breaks my heart because as I talk to my friends that are black and we debate these concerns or lack of concerns,

3321
04:15:53,399 --> 04:15:59,282
[SPEAKER_49]: You get, it falls into two sides, and that's what you're seeing happening in our community right now.

3322
04:16:00,062 --> 04:16:06,286
[SPEAKER_49]: You have people like the young lady who just spoke where, you know, how dumb are we?

3323
04:16:06,726 --> 04:16:11,628
[SPEAKER_49]: When it's affecting people in our community, how could we not want to support the Black Lives Matter sign?

3324
04:16:12,549 --> 04:16:22,454
[SPEAKER_49]: But at the same time, to bring in the politics of this, you do have organizations and my friends of color that have told me they felt

3325
04:16:23,126 --> 04:16:27,347
[SPEAKER_49]: that they're using this statement as a political movement.

3326
04:16:28,527 --> 04:16:33,429
[SPEAKER_49]: Whether it's Medford, whether it is in Medford, as I talk to them, there is a divide.

3327
04:16:34,069 --> 04:16:41,051
[SPEAKER_49]: There's a divide in the black community about the Black Lives Matter, from the people I've talked to, my friends that I've talked to, and it's

3328
04:16:42,569 --> 04:16:54,275
[SPEAKER_49]: sad to the fact where I'm getting texts right now from Black members in our community, I won't say their names, that are telling me that All Lives Matter means it should be thrown away.

3329
04:16:54,355 --> 04:16:55,335
[SPEAKER_49]: Of course it should be.

3330
04:16:56,416 --> 04:17:01,478
[SPEAKER_49]: I would never, ever use the All Lives Matter in the context we're speaking in right now.

3331
04:17:02,959 --> 04:17:07,622
[SPEAKER_49]: Because we do have racial issues in our country.

3332
04:17:09,242 --> 04:17:10,483
[SPEAKER_49]: But I think it's important that

3333
04:17:11,201 --> 04:17:19,547
[SPEAKER_49]: We still have to understand this is a governing body that wants to support everybody in our community.

3334
04:17:20,228 --> 04:17:24,911
[SPEAKER_49]: But we also want to make sure that, like council said, we go through the process.

3335
04:17:26,413 --> 04:17:32,597
[SPEAKER_49]: And again, it's comical because for me talking, you've got to be careful what you're going to say.

3336
04:17:32,938 --> 04:17:35,840
[SPEAKER_49]: And I've said this when I first started running for office.

3337
04:17:36,160 --> 04:17:39,963
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm going to do what's right in my heart for what I think is best for the city of Medford.

3338
04:17:40,552 --> 04:17:42,933
[SPEAKER_49]: When I was a school team member, it was best for the kids in Medford.

3339
04:17:43,853 --> 04:17:45,753
[SPEAKER_49]: Now it's for everybody in Medford.

3340
04:17:45,973 --> 04:17:48,154
[SPEAKER_49]: And I have to live with the decisions I make, right or wrong.

3341
04:17:49,154 --> 04:18:03,097
[SPEAKER_49]: But it's comical that in a past meeting that I had hundreds of phone calls from my former players and my friends of color that said, George, why didn't you respond to that woman that called you a racist?

3342
04:18:04,443 --> 04:18:10,986
[SPEAKER_49]: And I said, geez, I'm sorry, my dog was barking and I happened to let my dog out and I couldn't defend myself.

3343
04:18:12,866 --> 04:18:28,712
[SPEAKER_49]: And I find myself sitting back saying, to use my background and what I've done for people, white, black, yellow, green, what I've done for people I would never use as a platform.

3344
04:18:30,113 --> 04:18:32,514
[SPEAKER_49]: But when it affects your family and affects your kids,

3345
04:18:33,270 --> 04:18:41,493
[SPEAKER_49]: And they're being talked about or brought out for something somebody says, the people that don't know each other.

3346
04:18:42,914 --> 04:18:44,974
[SPEAKER_49]: It stopped dividing this community.

3347
04:18:46,755 --> 04:18:50,236
[SPEAKER_49]: And the point that I'm trying to make is very simple.

3348
04:18:50,517 --> 04:18:51,617
[SPEAKER_49]: Black lives do matter.

3349
04:18:52,817 --> 04:18:56,999
[SPEAKER_49]: And as I stand with my friends of color, they know George Scott probably knows that.

3350
04:18:58,007 --> 04:19:03,832
[SPEAKER_49]: As a city councilor, I know that I want to follow the process that Councilor Marks has put forth.

3351
04:19:05,353 --> 04:19:07,916
[SPEAKER_49]: But again, Medford needs to start to heal.

3352
04:19:08,836 --> 04:19:11,659
[SPEAKER_49]: And we need to start to bring Medford back together again.

3353
04:19:12,259 --> 04:19:14,381
[SPEAKER_49]: There's a reason why everybody moved to Medford.

3354
04:19:14,741 --> 04:19:16,163
[SPEAKER_49]: Medford is a great community.

3355
04:19:16,763 --> 04:19:18,044
[SPEAKER_49]: We love Medford, all of us.

3356
04:19:19,405 --> 04:19:19,786
[SPEAKER_49]: All of us.

3357
04:19:21,932 --> 04:19:31,274
[SPEAKER_49]: Whether you're fighting for your own social causes, or whether you've lived here for 35 years, it doesn't matter.

3358
04:19:31,334 --> 04:19:34,914
[SPEAKER_49]: We have to find a common ground to bring Metro back together.

3359
04:19:34,934 --> 04:19:44,256
[SPEAKER_49]: Because I've heard so many people, the disappointment in our elderly, in our people that have just moved to the city, to say that, why are we so divided?

3360
04:19:44,356 --> 04:19:45,496
[SPEAKER_49]: We need to come together.

3361
04:19:47,357 --> 04:19:48,577
[SPEAKER_49]: So we need it from the leadership.

3362
04:19:49,454 --> 04:19:52,995
[SPEAKER_49]: Now the male will follow this process, and then we will follow this process.

3363
04:19:53,295 --> 04:20:05,539
[SPEAKER_49]: And if the Black Lives Matter sign hangs in Medford, and that now sends a message to everybody in our community that we stand together with Black lives, that's the process we went through.

3364
04:20:05,559 --> 04:20:07,019
[SPEAKER_49]: And we shall be proud of that.

3365
04:20:09,300 --> 04:20:17,482
[SPEAKER_49]: But at the same time, to say, everybody say that this isn't a political statement, this is what's dividing us.

3366
04:20:18,160 --> 04:20:27,625
[SPEAKER_49]: Because A, it is, and then B, the people that are looking at it the other side, they're not looking at it as how to help our black brothers and sisters.

3367
04:20:28,765 --> 04:20:36,309
[SPEAKER_49]: It's being looked at to say, well, let's look at that political group that's breaking our community down.

3368
04:20:37,970 --> 04:20:40,772
[SPEAKER_49]: And in a sense, yes, it does make some people look racist.

3369
04:20:42,673 --> 04:20:43,933
[SPEAKER_49]: And I don't think that's the intent.

3370
04:20:45,654 --> 04:20:47,155
[SPEAKER_49]: Unfortunately, I'm not naive.

3371
04:20:47,865 --> 04:20:48,965
[SPEAKER_49]: Racism does exist.

3372
04:20:50,346 --> 04:21:12,331
[SPEAKER_49]: But I tell you, when I talk to my friends of color, and I talk to them, and how sad it is when they tell me that their kids are afraid to go to school because of one reason or another, or our white kids are afraid to go to school because they're put on a list that they've used a racial slur.

3373
04:21:15,470 --> 04:21:16,631
[SPEAKER_49]: It's dividing this community.

3374
04:21:16,671 --> 04:21:19,532
[SPEAKER_49]: We need to find something that's going to bring this together.

3375
04:21:19,572 --> 04:21:36,518
[SPEAKER_49]: So if we can follow through with Councilman Moxley's suggestions, and we make sure we dot our I's and cross our T's, and that's the resolution that we now hang the Black Lives Matter at Methodist City Hall, and that's the way we go.

3376
04:21:36,818 --> 04:21:43,540
[SPEAKER_49]: We need to find a way to stand together and heal and stop dividing.

3377
04:21:45,876 --> 04:22:05,580
[SPEAKER_49]: So believe me, I work in the community that first put that banner out, and I'm telling you, whatever you want to think, whether you're white or black, I heard from every single color that came to talk to me that looked at that as a platform instead of what's really intended for.

3378
04:22:05,600 --> 04:22:09,640
[SPEAKER_49]: And it divided people in that community, both black and white.

3379
04:22:10,341 --> 04:22:12,801
[SPEAKER_49]: And black people were for it, and black people were against it.

3380
04:22:15,171 --> 04:22:19,973
[SPEAKER_49]: So this is bigger, this is made up bigger than it really is.

3381
04:22:20,893 --> 04:22:22,774
[SPEAKER_49]: And it has, and it shouldn't.

3382
04:22:24,955 --> 04:22:30,637
[SPEAKER_49]: So all I beg to everybody in our community is let this take its course.

3383
04:22:32,698 --> 04:22:35,039
[SPEAKER_49]: And let's find a way to all come together and heal.

3384
04:22:36,120 --> 04:22:38,481
[SPEAKER_49]: Because when we voted on making

3385
04:22:39,580 --> 04:22:43,902
[SPEAKER_49]: making, um, uh, announcing, uh, racism, uh, public health emergency.

3386
04:22:43,942 --> 04:22:44,863
[SPEAKER_49]: I voted no on that.

3387
04:22:45,183 --> 04:22:50,046
[SPEAKER_49]: And I got feedback because I'm racist, but here we are here.

3388
04:22:50,086 --> 04:22:51,466
[SPEAKER_49]: We are months later.

3389
04:22:54,388 --> 04:22:59,050
[SPEAKER_49]: And like I said, nothing has been done as a community.

3390
04:22:59,091 --> 04:23:01,692
[SPEAKER_49]: We've done nothing to bring people together.

3391
04:23:02,947 --> 04:23:06,388
[SPEAKER_49]: I've asked for our black leaders in our community.

3392
04:23:06,668 --> 04:23:13,950
[SPEAKER_49]: I've asked for our black leaders in our schools to find a way that we can meet together with social distancing with the COVID.

3393
04:23:13,970 --> 04:23:25,073
[SPEAKER_49]: We could use that excuses to a blue in the face, but we need to meet together with the police chief, the superintendent of schools, the mayor, the city council, the school committee, everybody that makes the decision.

3394
04:23:25,093 --> 04:23:26,893
[SPEAKER_49]: So we all understand how we need to heal.

3395
04:23:28,246 --> 04:23:35,651
[SPEAKER_49]: And I know one council said, shame on you want, you want, now you want people to people of color to teach us what's wrong.

3396
04:23:36,952 --> 04:23:38,613
[SPEAKER_49]: Yes, we need to.

3397
04:23:40,734 --> 04:23:42,875
[SPEAKER_49]: Because that color of skin does not match theirs.

3398
04:23:43,296 --> 04:23:45,177
[SPEAKER_49]: And we've never lived what they're living through.

3399
04:23:46,758 --> 04:23:48,159
[SPEAKER_49]: So I apologize.

3400
04:23:48,179 --> 04:23:53,602
[SPEAKER_49]: Overly winded Mr. President, but I thought I knew that had to be said.

3401
04:23:53,622 --> 04:23:54,162
[SPEAKER_49]: So thank you.

3402
04:23:54,603 --> 04:23:54,903
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

3403
04:23:54,923 --> 04:23:55,863
[SPEAKER_31]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

3404
04:23:55,884 --> 04:23:56,484
[SPEAKER_31]: Councilor Laurel.

3405
04:23:57,773 --> 04:23:58,633
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3406
04:23:58,693 --> 04:24:02,355
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to reiterate my point that this is not a political statement.

3407
04:24:02,395 --> 04:24:03,676
[SPEAKER_31]: This is about human rights.

3408
04:24:03,736 --> 04:24:07,878
[SPEAKER_31]: The Office of Special Counsel found that Black Lives Matter is not a political statement.

3409
04:24:08,318 --> 04:24:19,364
[SPEAKER_31]: And to say that it is a political statement is something that you're able to do when your life, your lived experience, your day in, day out is not impacted.

3410
04:24:19,404 --> 04:24:21,645
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's a privilege to be able to say, hey, that's political.

3411
04:24:21,925 --> 04:24:24,867
[SPEAKER_31]: Whereas for everyone else, for the people affected, it's a human right.

3412
04:24:25,087 --> 04:24:25,647
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you.

3413
04:24:26,608 --> 04:24:26,888
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

3414
04:24:28,188 --> 04:24:36,710
[SPEAKER_49]: And again, Mr. President, I'm going to say, if I can interject, and I appreciate Councilor Merrill for saying that, but it's easy to say what you just said.

3415
04:24:37,470 --> 04:24:40,271
[SPEAKER_49]: But the truth of the matter is, it is a political statement.

3416
04:24:40,931 --> 04:24:42,372
[SPEAKER_49]: Unfortunately, it is.

3417
04:24:42,452 --> 04:24:46,993
[SPEAKER_49]: We could all say it's not, but unfortunately it is, on both sides.

3418
04:24:48,233 --> 04:24:51,254
[SPEAKER_49]: So we need to find a way to get through this and stop hailing from that.

3419
04:24:51,514 --> 04:24:53,574
[SPEAKER_49]: We have to acknowledge this stuff and move forward.

3420
04:24:54,155 --> 04:24:54,515
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

3421
04:24:54,975 --> 04:24:56,035
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

3422
04:24:56,972 --> 04:25:00,753
[SPEAKER_38]: So let's see, we have Councilor Beers.

3423
04:25:02,993 --> 04:25:06,874
[SPEAKER_29]: Very quickly, this is not in any way an attempt to divide the city.

3424
04:25:06,934 --> 04:25:11,875
[SPEAKER_29]: I think what's dividing the city is decades, if not centuries of unaddressed discrimination.

3425
04:25:12,275 --> 04:25:13,415
[SPEAKER_29]: This is an attempt to heal.

3426
04:25:13,795 --> 04:25:17,796
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't say it any better than Grace about how important this is to so many people that we do this.

3427
04:25:17,876 --> 04:25:18,756
[SPEAKER_29]: So let's do it.

3428
04:25:19,016 --> 04:25:20,217
[SPEAKER_29]: This is the action we can take.

3429
04:25:20,337 --> 04:25:21,297
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3430
04:25:21,577 --> 04:25:22,397
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Beers.

3431
04:25:25,153 --> 04:25:27,275
[SPEAKER_37]: Diane Sullivan, name and address to the record, please.

3432
04:25:33,379 --> 04:25:33,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3433
04:25:33,759 --> 04:25:34,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

3434
04:25:34,360 --> 04:25:34,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

3435
04:25:35,321 --> 04:25:36,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Falco.

3436
04:25:37,722 --> 04:25:40,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Diane Sullivan, Jerome Street, West Medford.

3437
04:25:41,125 --> 04:25:44,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I too stand in support of hanging a banner at City Hall.

3438
04:25:44,987 --> 04:25:49,911
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems the very least that we could do to begin the necessary healing in this city.

3439
04:25:50,712 --> 04:25:52,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate what Councilor Behrs just said.

3440
04:25:52,534 --> 04:25:59,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I would argue it is certainly not making the statement Black Lives Matter that is dividing the city.

3441
04:25:59,219 --> 04:26:03,082
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the response to this necessary statement.

3442
04:26:05,404 --> 04:26:06,765
[SPEAKER_04]: There was so much more that I could say.

3443
04:26:07,005 --> 04:26:09,227
[SPEAKER_04]: My son just graduated from high school.

3444
04:26:09,267 --> 04:26:12,109
[SPEAKER_04]: He was honored with a banner along with the entire class of 2020.

3445
04:26:12,189 --> 04:26:18,294
[SPEAKER_04]: The statement Black Lives Matter is just as important to him.

3446
04:26:19,721 --> 04:26:39,686
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Councilor Scarpelli, through you, President Falco, my own daughter had to have the conversation with her grandmother about why the statement Black Lives Matter is important and is not in fact a political statement as a young black woman dealing with racism in her life.

3447
04:26:40,566 --> 04:26:45,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would really encourage you all, leaders in this city,

3448
04:26:46,896 --> 04:26:49,879
[SPEAKER_04]: to really start this healing by starting with education.

3449
04:26:50,259 --> 04:26:59,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to see more community forums dealing with this issue, but we have to be meaningful in this.

3450
04:26:59,847 --> 04:27:00,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to end it there.

3451
04:27:01,069 --> 04:27:02,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's been a long night for everybody.

3452
04:27:03,514 --> 04:27:04,815
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get this banner up.

3453
04:27:04,915 --> 04:27:05,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a start.

3454
04:27:05,776 --> 04:27:06,896
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not divisive.

3455
04:27:07,237 --> 04:27:10,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It is miseducation, misinformation that is dividing this city.

3456
04:27:11,560 --> 04:27:19,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And so again, I just, I thank the counselors who are supporting this and all of the members in the community who have stood up in support of this.

3457
04:27:19,125 --> 04:27:19,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

3458
04:27:19,805 --> 04:27:26,410
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Diane.

3459
04:27:27,290 --> 04:27:30,593
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so Matthew, you have a minute and a half.

3460
04:27:30,673 --> 04:27:32,074
[SPEAKER_37]: This is your second time.

3461
04:27:34,778 --> 04:27:36,939
[SPEAKER_53]: I just wanted to change to something I said previously.

3462
04:27:36,980 --> 04:27:40,462
[SPEAKER_53]: I was suggesting that both of these resolutions or both of these things were voted upon.

3463
04:27:40,922 --> 04:27:45,345
[SPEAKER_53]: But now that it's completely clear, it's absolutely clear that this is just a recommendation to the mayor's office.

3464
04:27:45,665 --> 04:27:49,508
[SPEAKER_53]: This is in no shape or form a violation of a separation of powers.

3465
04:27:50,248 --> 04:27:55,151
[SPEAKER_53]: There's no reason that I could possibly see why this particular council needs any kind of clarification.

3466
04:27:55,171 --> 04:27:57,613
[SPEAKER_53]: Because this council is not going to take any further action.

3467
04:27:57,853 --> 04:27:58,874
[SPEAKER_53]: It's just a recommendation.

3468
04:27:59,214 --> 04:27:59,794
[SPEAKER_53]: So that's about it.

3469
04:27:59,834 --> 04:28:00,875
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

3470
04:28:01,542 --> 04:28:03,163
[SPEAKER_37]: Kelly Kuda, name and address for the record.

3471
04:28:03,504 --> 04:28:04,584
[SPEAKER_37]: President, point of information.

3472
04:28:05,345 --> 04:28:08,027
[SPEAKER_37]: One minute, point of information, I believe that was Councilor Knight.

3473
04:28:08,548 --> 04:28:15,453
[SPEAKER_43]: I do believe it would be pertinent if we allowed everybody who hasn't had an opportunity to speak once to speak before we allow people to speak twice on the same issue.

3474
04:28:15,493 --> 04:28:23,239
[SPEAKER_43]: We're now at 11.30 and we still have 15 items left on our agenda to go through, one of which is a financial paper.

3475
04:28:23,680 --> 04:28:27,863
[SPEAKER_37]: And I believe Kelly's the only hand up, so I think she is the last one to go.

3476
04:28:29,175 --> 04:28:30,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, and I'll be really quick.

3477
04:28:30,235 --> 04:28:32,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Kelly Cunha, 21, just to show you yet again.

3478
04:28:33,036 --> 04:28:36,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli, I just wanted to recommend these books.

3479
04:28:36,296 --> 04:28:45,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Your comment, well, I can feel your passion, and I'm trying to come at this from a really, like, you are really centering yourself.

3480
04:28:45,838 --> 04:28:52,699
[SPEAKER_13]: You kept repeatedly talking about, you know, you being called a racist, and so there's just a lot of education that I feel needs to be done.

3481
04:28:52,799 --> 04:28:54,279
[SPEAKER_13]: These two really great books.

3482
04:28:54,659 --> 04:28:57,500
[SPEAKER_13]: So you wanna talk about race and how to be an anti-racist.

3483
04:28:57,520 --> 04:28:58,520
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually a Medford,

3484
04:28:59,912 --> 04:29:01,393
[SPEAKER_13]: book club on this right now.

3485
04:29:01,553 --> 04:29:03,054
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't recommend these books enough.

3486
04:29:03,074 --> 04:29:03,575
[SPEAKER_13]: They're amazing.

3487
04:29:03,595 --> 04:29:04,996
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not trying to sound condescending.

3488
04:29:05,036 --> 04:29:06,117
[SPEAKER_13]: I truly am not.

3489
04:29:06,517 --> 04:29:07,718
[SPEAKER_13]: I've learned so much from this.

3490
04:29:08,118 --> 04:29:21,208
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just think that as someone who's in your position and who has the ability to make change in the city, having some information about how some of the things that you say could actually be harmful, like talking about green people.

3491
04:29:21,228 --> 04:29:22,209
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not green people.

3492
04:29:22,229 --> 04:29:23,210
[SPEAKER_13]: That's actually not a thing.

3493
04:29:23,770 --> 04:29:26,092
[SPEAKER_13]: And just kind of educating yourself about like,

3494
04:29:26,783 --> 04:29:32,967
[SPEAKER_13]: the things that you say and how you're centering yourself as a white man would be really helpful to just kind of get some education.

3495
04:29:33,007 --> 04:29:33,847
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to lend them to you.

3496
04:29:33,867 --> 04:29:39,831
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not being, I'm truly, I'm genuinely asking that maybe some education would be helpful.

3497
04:29:39,851 --> 04:29:40,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

3498
04:29:40,972 --> 04:29:41,272
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

3499
04:29:41,292 --> 04:29:42,332
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, if I can.

3500
04:29:43,053 --> 04:29:47,716
[SPEAKER_49]: And this is what I'm talking about, Mr. President.

3501
04:29:48,176 --> 04:29:53,359
[SPEAKER_49]: A figure of speech has turned into something that I now have to read about racism.

3502
04:29:55,430 --> 04:30:05,478
[SPEAKER_49]: I've worked 35 years helping kids of color of the Latino race, Asian individuals.

3503
04:30:06,439 --> 04:30:08,440
[SPEAKER_49]: I've helped hundreds, if not thousands of kids.

3504
04:30:08,940 --> 04:30:10,121
[SPEAKER_49]: I've sat in their living rooms.

3505
04:30:10,802 --> 04:30:12,063
[SPEAKER_49]: They sat in my living rooms.

3506
04:30:13,004 --> 04:30:15,165
[SPEAKER_49]: They've cried to me for issues of race.

3507
04:30:16,867 --> 04:30:18,127
[SPEAKER_49]: They've come to me for guidance.

3508
04:30:19,629 --> 04:30:20,930
[SPEAKER_49]: I've gone to them for guidance.

3509
04:30:22,070 --> 04:30:25,193
[SPEAKER_49]: When we talk about race, I don't look at a book and read a book about race.

3510
04:30:25,996 --> 04:30:30,517
[SPEAKER_49]: I sit with my brothers and sisters that I coached and taught for 35 years.

3511
04:30:32,557 --> 04:30:38,939
[SPEAKER_49]: So when I say the people that called me racist, are there ignorant people that don't know George Scott Pelley?

3512
04:30:40,999 --> 04:30:49,741
[SPEAKER_49]: Just because this counselor wears his heart on his sleeve and will say what needs to be said does not make me weak because I'm a white privileged man.

3513
04:30:50,561 --> 04:30:54,402
[SPEAKER_49]: It makes me understand what we need to do to move forward and that is

3514
04:30:54,947 --> 04:31:04,375
[SPEAKER_49]: what I've learned by talking to my friends of color that I've talked to that they've sat at my dinner table and had dinner with my kids.

3515
04:31:05,776 --> 04:31:18,467
[SPEAKER_49]: So my son and daughter walk into a room, they don't see a color and thank God for that because we've always had an open door policy in the Scott Pelly house that everybody was welcome.

3516
04:31:18,848 --> 04:31:22,451
[SPEAKER_49]: I never looked at a kid because of his color, the color of their skin.

3517
04:31:24,244 --> 04:31:27,045
[SPEAKER_49]: So maybe I have to educate people in who I am as a person.

3518
04:31:27,365 --> 04:31:28,165
[SPEAKER_49]: I don't need a book.

3519
04:31:29,725 --> 04:31:45,729
[SPEAKER_49]: I'll read it just to enlighten me a little, but to understand when I deal with racism, I deal with racism standing across the boys and girls, the men and women that I've helped in my life.

3520
04:31:48,149 --> 04:31:49,429
[SPEAKER_49]: That's who George Scott Pelley is.

3521
04:31:49,830 --> 04:31:51,990
[SPEAKER_49]: George Scott Pelley, when I brought up the racial comment,

3522
04:31:53,444 --> 04:31:59,307
[SPEAKER_49]: That was offensive to all the kids that I've helped in their lives, getting them into college, helping them fill out the FAFSAs.

3523
04:31:59,627 --> 04:32:10,531
[SPEAKER_49]: I envisioned, I've sat through systemic racism for 35 years as a high school soccer coach, trying to help kids get into college universities.

3524
04:32:14,313 --> 04:32:21,516
[SPEAKER_49]: So these are the concerns that I have with people in the community right now that have tagged people like George Scapelli and others

3525
04:32:22,893 --> 04:32:25,576
[SPEAKER_49]: as racist when you don't know who they are as people.

3526
04:32:26,997 --> 04:32:28,198
[SPEAKER_49]: So yes, we need to grow.

3527
04:32:28,718 --> 04:32:29,419
[SPEAKER_49]: We need to help.

3528
04:32:30,260 --> 04:32:34,784
[SPEAKER_49]: We need to make movement because there are racial issues in this country, in this community.

3529
04:32:37,566 --> 04:32:41,150
[SPEAKER_49]: But please, let's find a way to come together and not divide.

3530
04:32:42,231 --> 04:32:42,791
[SPEAKER_49]: So thank you.

3531
04:32:43,412 --> 04:32:44,953
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Carlos Garapelli.

3532
04:32:45,594 --> 04:32:48,456
[SPEAKER_37]: Jessica Zubart, you have a name and address for the record.

3533
04:32:48,476 --> 04:32:49,297
[SPEAKER_37]: You have a minute and a half.

3534
04:32:50,647 --> 04:32:51,929
[SPEAKER_65]: Hi, I won't take a minute and a half.

3535
04:32:52,249 --> 04:32:54,772
[SPEAKER_65]: Jessica Zubart, 79, Governor's Ave.

3536
04:32:55,253 --> 04:32:59,438
[SPEAKER_65]: And I actually didn't intend to speak until Councillor Scarpelli's comments just now.

3537
04:32:59,918 --> 04:33:03,623
[SPEAKER_65]: And I just want to piggyback off of what Kelly said, because I think you're missing the point.

3538
04:33:03,643 --> 04:33:06,166
[SPEAKER_65]: And the point is, this is not about you, actually.

3539
04:33:06,466 --> 04:33:09,510
[SPEAKER_65]: This is not about you and anything anyone has said about you.

3540
04:33:09,870 --> 04:33:13,332
[SPEAKER_65]: This is about the simple fact that we have said that Black Lives Matter.

3541
04:33:13,912 --> 04:33:26,357
[SPEAKER_65]: You, as a council, have said that Black Lives Matter, and yet you continuously ignore that statement in our, what, protocol of processes, out of feeling insulted because you thought someone called you a racist.

3542
04:33:26,677 --> 04:33:27,517
[SPEAKER_65]: Point of information.

3543
04:33:27,537 --> 04:33:29,018
[SPEAKER_65]: Point of information, Mr. President.

3544
04:33:29,038 --> 04:33:30,319
[SPEAKER_49]: Point of information, Mr. President.

3545
04:33:30,899 --> 04:33:38,202
[SPEAKER_49]: Again, and this is why when people speak from their heart, it's taken from the people's vision that's across them that they want to correct.

3546
04:33:38,982 --> 04:33:43,083
[SPEAKER_49]: When I say this, I do not, I've never in my life used about me.

3547
04:33:43,123 --> 04:33:53,525
[SPEAKER_49]: What I'm telling you, the education that I've gotten about racism doesn't come from anybody else, but the people that I work with every day.

3548
04:33:53,905 --> 04:33:58,606
[SPEAKER_49]: So I don't question who I am as a person and I'm not trying to defend myself or protect myself.

3549
04:33:59,146 --> 04:34:07,988
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm trying to enlighten the people that don't know George Scott belly to let them know that I've gone out and I've listened to people and I understand what they want.

3550
04:34:09,500 --> 04:34:11,281
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

3551
04:34:12,762 --> 04:34:13,242
[SPEAKER_37]: Jessica?

3552
04:34:14,663 --> 04:34:17,404
[SPEAKER_65]: I just want to thank Councillor Scarpelli for proving my point.

3553
04:34:18,745 --> 04:34:24,067
[SPEAKER_65]: And there's nothing else to say, because I think we can just kind of continue this conversation, but it just keeps coming back to that.

3554
04:34:24,127 --> 04:34:27,529
[SPEAKER_65]: So I appreciate you making my point better than I ever could.

3555
04:34:29,490 --> 04:34:31,131
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Jessica.

3556
04:34:31,151 --> 04:34:32,752
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, we have Matt.

3557
04:34:34,192 --> 04:34:35,273
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address of the record, Matt.

3558
04:34:37,076 --> 04:34:39,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, y'all, Matt, 76 Boston Ave.

3559
04:34:40,117 --> 04:34:56,964
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually wanted to raise a point of order at the way that Scarpelli is using a point of information to attempt to interrupt the constituent, which actually violates Robert's rules of order, which is controlling for this body.

3560
04:34:58,304 --> 04:35:05,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Points of information are actually meant to be posed as questions to the chair, and then the chair will- Point of order, Mr. President.

3561
04:35:07,502 --> 04:35:09,043
[SPEAKER_32]: Point of order, Councilor Knight.

3562
04:35:09,623 --> 04:35:11,004
[SPEAKER_43]: The chair is the parliamentarian.

3563
04:35:11,024 --> 04:35:11,885
[SPEAKER_43]: The chair runs the meeting.

3564
04:35:12,385 --> 04:35:15,206
[SPEAKER_43]: None of the members have objected to the way that the point of information was handled.

3565
04:35:15,306 --> 04:35:19,389
[SPEAKER_43]: As such, I believe that this is an operational issue, no more, no less.

3566
04:35:20,089 --> 04:35:34,056
[SPEAKER_43]: And quite frankly, at this late hour, and based upon the direction that this conversation is going, and very far off course from whether or not we should hang signs on City Hall, it has now really turned into something, I think, a little bit more than that.

3567
04:35:35,467 --> 04:35:43,731
[SPEAKER_43]: I think it might be prudent for us to take a deep breath maybe and refocus where we are and move on with a vote.

3568
04:35:44,531 --> 04:35:46,172
[SPEAKER_37]: Matt, would you like to speak about the sign?

3569
04:35:49,233 --> 04:36:03,259
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to speak about the sign in that I think that the ways in which points of order and points of information are used to interrupt speakers actually plays into what previous constituents mentioned about the sign, which is that

3570
04:36:04,335 --> 04:36:17,063
[SPEAKER_11]: The ways in which we use rules to put and put rules in front of progress is part of the system that is oppressive to black people in this city.

3571
04:36:18,964 --> 04:36:19,884
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

3572
04:36:19,924 --> 04:36:20,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll let it rest there.

3573
04:36:21,365 --> 04:36:21,865
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Matt.

3574
04:36:24,507 --> 04:36:33,132
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's see.

3575
04:36:33,212 --> 04:36:33,472
[SPEAKER_38]: Michael.

3576
04:36:35,148 --> 04:36:36,369
[SPEAKER_38]: Name and address for the record, Michael.

3577
04:36:36,889 --> 04:36:39,030
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Michael Bernstein, Lyman Avenue, Medford.

3578
04:36:39,590 --> 04:36:48,135
[SPEAKER_00]: I would simply ask that we worry less about whether Black Lives Matter is a political statement and worry more about whether we can make it be a true statement.

3579
04:36:48,855 --> 04:36:57,239
[SPEAKER_00]: We can and should begin to show that Black Lives Matter to our city government by putting up this banner as a statement of what our city government believes.

3580
04:36:57,539 --> 04:36:57,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

3581
04:36:59,660 --> 04:36:59,980
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

3582
04:37:01,501 --> 04:37:03,742
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's see, we have Jess F.

3583
04:37:13,611 --> 04:37:13,871
[SPEAKER_63]: Jess.

3584
04:37:14,772 --> 04:37:19,332
[SPEAKER_63]: Hi, this is Jess Farrell from Martin Street, Medford.

3585
04:37:19,993 --> 04:37:30,695
[SPEAKER_45]: I just wanted to voice my support for the banner and everybody has already made a lot of great reasons why so I won't take up any more time, but I just wanted to voice my support.

3586
04:37:30,795 --> 04:37:31,155
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you.

3587
04:37:32,575 --> 04:37:32,875
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you.

3588
04:37:40,981 --> 04:37:41,422
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay, Will.

3589
04:37:45,690 --> 04:37:48,054
[SPEAKER_37]: Will, you have a minute and a half.

3590
04:37:48,175 --> 04:37:48,615
[SPEAKER_56]: Okay, cool.

3591
04:37:48,956 --> 04:37:51,401
[SPEAKER_56]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

3592
04:37:54,034 --> 04:37:57,796
[SPEAKER_56]: I didn't really come to these council meetings originally to discuss this issue.

3593
04:37:57,897 --> 04:38:08,222
[SPEAKER_56]: And so I'm not really going, I wanna sort of remind ourselves of something we heard a few weeks ago where we were discussing if we were gonna make a public health emergency of racism.

3594
04:38:08,962 --> 04:38:21,929
[SPEAKER_56]: And one of the community members of color said that she didn't feel heard during some of these meetings and that she felt that council was not sort of a,

3595
04:38:23,991 --> 04:38:30,964
[SPEAKER_56]: great place, you know, for people of color and views like those sort of things.

3596
04:38:32,647 --> 04:38:33,449
[SPEAKER_56]: So I think that

3597
04:38:36,389 --> 04:38:38,950
[SPEAKER_56]: I sort of just want to advise and give my perspective.

3598
04:38:39,290 --> 04:38:49,453
[SPEAKER_56]: But I don't think that voters who are excited about Black Lives Matter are going to be trying to look into the hearts of the works of the resumes of counselors to figure out if they're racist.

3599
04:38:49,853 --> 04:39:00,076
[SPEAKER_56]: I think they're going to think about whether or not they feel that the counselors are doing a good job making people of color feel welcome.

3600
04:39:01,376 --> 04:39:02,336
[SPEAKER_56]: and that kind of thing.

3601
04:39:04,138 --> 04:39:10,603
[SPEAKER_56]: That's really just a point that I think I wanted to reiterate that I heard another person make a few weeks ago.

3602
04:39:10,703 --> 04:39:15,046
[SPEAKER_56]: And that's what I get out of this conversation.

3603
04:39:15,227 --> 04:39:16,367
[SPEAKER_56]: That's my point, Mr. President.

3604
04:39:16,387 --> 04:39:16,728
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

3605
04:39:17,528 --> 04:39:17,989
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you, Will.

3606
04:39:19,750 --> 04:39:20,070
[SPEAKER_56]: Okay.

3607
04:39:21,892 --> 04:39:22,832
[SPEAKER_37]: So that is everyone.

3608
04:39:24,414 --> 04:39:28,517
[SPEAKER_37]: I thank everyone for weighing in and giving their thoughts and opinions and asking questions.

3609
04:39:29,341 --> 04:39:36,086
[SPEAKER_37]: Do the councilors have any further questions before we call the roll on these resolutions?

3610
04:39:37,507 --> 04:39:41,230
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, I just have a question around clarity.

3611
04:39:41,350 --> 04:39:48,656
[SPEAKER_31]: I think there's the original motion, just moving for approval for the original paper, and then there's Councilor Marks's, which is to receive and place on file.

3612
04:39:49,056 --> 04:39:50,177
[SPEAKER_31]: Are those separate?

3613
04:39:50,377 --> 04:39:53,840
[SPEAKER_31]: As I understand, there's two motions out there.

3614
04:39:53,860 --> 04:39:57,443
[SPEAKER_37]: Those are two separate resolutions, two separate motions.

3615
04:39:57,463 --> 04:39:58,043
[SPEAKER_37]: You are correct.

3616
04:39:58,423 --> 04:39:58,984
[SPEAKER_37]: OK, thank you.

3617
04:39:59,656 --> 04:40:01,459
[SPEAKER_37]: The first being offered by Council of Peers.

3618
04:40:02,661 --> 04:40:05,325
[SPEAKER_38]: The second resolution was offered by Council of Marks.

3619
04:40:06,867 --> 04:40:07,228
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

3620
04:40:07,288 --> 04:40:10,593
[SPEAKER_38]: Any other questions from the council?

3621
04:40:10,613 --> 04:40:14,720
[SPEAKER_42]: Roll the roll.

3622
04:40:21,543 --> 04:40:32,931
[SPEAKER_37]: If I may, I know as the president, I don't comment on too much and I pretty much preside over the meetings, but I just want to say that I believe emphatically that black lives matter.

3623
04:40:34,673 --> 04:40:41,778
[SPEAKER_37]: However, I do have some serious concerns about the council's authority to approve or disapprove putting a flag or banner on city hall property.

3624
04:40:43,079 --> 04:40:47,162
[SPEAKER_37]: There are no guidelines in place regarding which flags or banners are permitted.

3625
04:40:47,870 --> 04:40:54,852
[SPEAKER_37]: And I do need that this I do believe that this needs to be established outside City Hall is a pride flag that went up.

3626
04:40:55,172 --> 04:40:56,553
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't think it went up with a council vote.

3627
04:40:57,053 --> 04:40:58,874
[SPEAKER_37]: But I want to support that flag too.

3628
04:40:58,974 --> 04:41:02,735
[SPEAKER_37]: And I personally understand its significance to the LGBTQ community.

3629
04:41:03,331 --> 04:41:04,672
[SPEAKER_37]: as a father of a gay child.

3630
04:41:05,593 --> 04:41:10,617
[SPEAKER_37]: But what happens next week if a petition is made to fly a straight pride flag?

3631
04:41:10,777 --> 04:41:12,578
[SPEAKER_37]: Because yes, they do really exist.

3632
04:41:13,259 --> 04:41:19,704
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't believe it's within the council's purviews to choose which flags are raised without pre-existing guidelines.

3633
04:41:20,425 --> 04:41:24,868
[SPEAKER_37]: The city council has no jurisdiction whatsoever over City Hall.

3634
04:41:24,928 --> 04:41:27,631
[SPEAKER_37]: We have no jurisdiction, absolutely none.

3635
04:41:28,413 --> 04:41:33,037
[SPEAKER_37]: As a city council, we don't even have control over the thermostat in city council chambers.

3636
04:41:33,057 --> 04:41:34,278
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's a serious statement.

3637
04:41:34,959 --> 04:41:36,601
[SPEAKER_37]: So we have no control over the building.

3638
04:41:37,461 --> 04:41:41,005
[SPEAKER_37]: But I just wanted to just issue that small statement.

3639
04:41:41,685 --> 04:41:45,849
[SPEAKER_37]: But we do have a number of resolutions before us.

3640
04:41:45,929 --> 04:41:47,711
[SPEAKER_37]: The first one was offered by Council of Bears.

3641
04:41:50,578 --> 04:41:51,378
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'll read it again.

3642
04:41:51,398 --> 04:42:06,632
[SPEAKER_37]: Whereas systemic racism is an ongoing public health crisis that necessitates urgent action and whereas statements of solidarity and support can begin to address the history of racism and discrimination in our community and whereas residents of Medford have requested

3643
04:42:07,533 --> 04:42:09,816
[SPEAKER_37]: that the city take this action now.

3644
04:42:09,896 --> 04:42:19,225
[SPEAKER_37]: Therefore, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city of Memphis will hang a banner reading Black Lives Matter on the front of City Hall.

3645
04:42:19,685 --> 04:42:21,267
[SPEAKER_37]: That was offered by Councilor Behrs.

3646
04:42:21,687 --> 04:42:22,928
[SPEAKER_37]: Does that resolution have a second?

3647
04:42:24,890 --> 04:42:25,271
[SPEAKER_37]: Second.

3648
04:42:26,071 --> 04:42:27,333
[SPEAKER_37]: Second by Councilor Morrell.

3649
04:42:27,893 --> 04:42:28,554
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President.

3650
04:42:29,495 --> 04:42:30,175
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President.

3651
04:42:31,036 --> 04:42:31,557
[SPEAKER_44]: Councilor Morrell.

3652
04:42:32,271 --> 04:42:38,394
[SPEAKER_44]: If I'm not mistaken, my emotion, Mr President was offered first and it was seconded first.

3653
04:42:39,235 --> 04:42:41,856
[SPEAKER_44]: So I'm not sure why you would take up that first, Mr President.

3654
04:42:42,116 --> 04:42:43,597
[SPEAKER_44]: I would challenge the ruling of the chair.

3655
04:42:44,417 --> 04:42:49,179
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr President, I moved approval and got a second from Councilor Morrell at the beginning of this discussion.

3656
04:42:49,580 --> 04:42:53,461
[SPEAKER_44]: The first first person to speak might have been the first person to speak.

3657
04:42:53,481 --> 04:42:54,462
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't remember emotion.

3658
04:42:54,482 --> 04:42:56,683
[SPEAKER_29]: All right.

3659
04:42:57,331 --> 04:43:02,774
[SPEAKER_29]: I so move, and then I said I so move, and then Councilor Morrell said second, and then I believe the chair acknowledged the second.

3660
04:43:03,194 --> 04:43:04,254
[SPEAKER_41]: Point of order, Mr. President.

3661
04:43:04,614 --> 04:43:06,015
[SPEAKER_41]: Point of order, Councilor.

3662
04:43:06,455 --> 04:43:08,876
[SPEAKER_41]: I do believe the city clerk is the recording secretary for the body.

3663
04:43:08,996 --> 04:43:13,278
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm sure the city clerk has recorded the notes accurately as he does every meeting.

3664
04:43:13,458 --> 04:43:16,860
[SPEAKER_43]: Maybe we shall refer to the city clerk as to what order these operations were made in.

3665
04:43:17,440 --> 04:43:19,021
[SPEAKER_38]: I will defer to the city clerk.

3666
04:43:26,517 --> 04:43:28,017
[SPEAKER_38]: City Clerk, you're on mute.

3667
04:43:28,077 --> 04:43:28,778
[SPEAKER_57]: One minute.

3668
04:43:32,498 --> 04:43:33,578
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm looking through my notes.

3669
04:43:34,139 --> 04:43:38,219
[SPEAKER_57]: The first motion I have is from Councilor Marks.

3670
04:43:41,580 --> 04:43:42,780
[SPEAKER_57]: That's correct, Mr. President.

3671
04:43:45,481 --> 04:43:54,203
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Beers, I don't think yours had a second because they specifically said- Mr. President, the record still reflects, Mr. President.

3672
04:43:54,223 --> 04:43:54,763
[SPEAKER_41]: Ask and answer.

3673
04:43:54,783 --> 04:43:55,383
[SPEAKER_41]: Can we please move on?

3674
04:43:56,564 --> 04:44:02,346
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so Councilor Pietrangelo, there was no second when you mentioned your resolution.

3675
04:44:03,006 --> 04:44:05,087
[SPEAKER_37]: I asked for a second, there was no second.

3676
04:44:05,527 --> 04:44:07,388
[SPEAKER_37]: That has been reflected in the minutes as well.

3677
04:44:08,148 --> 04:44:12,790
[SPEAKER_37]: And then at that point, I believe maybe Councilor Knight spoke next.

3678
04:44:12,950 --> 04:44:18,572
[SPEAKER_38]: In that, I think Councilor Marks made his resolution.

3679
04:44:21,053 --> 04:44:25,935
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I accept the ruling of the chair, but I think if we watch the recording, we'll see that Councilor Morrell said that she seconds the motion.

3680
04:44:28,100 --> 04:44:29,481
[SPEAKER_37]: The clerk does not have it in his notes.

3681
04:44:29,821 --> 04:44:35,586
[SPEAKER_37]: And I don't remember that part either, because I don't, I specifically stated- Mr. President.

3682
04:44:36,487 --> 04:44:36,747
[SPEAKER_37]: Excuse me?

3683
04:44:36,787 --> 04:44:37,968
[SPEAKER_37]: Gentlemen, point of order.

3684
04:44:39,129 --> 04:44:41,611
[SPEAKER_41]: The gentleman said he was not gonna question the ruling of the chair.

3685
04:44:43,292 --> 04:44:48,937
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so that means that Councilor Marks' resolution would come up next.

3686
04:44:49,017 --> 04:44:50,979
[SPEAKER_37]: Could you read back the resolution, Councilor Marks?

3687
04:44:51,679 --> 04:44:52,960
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm sorry, Clerk Bernabe.

3688
04:44:55,382 --> 04:44:55,963
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks.

3689
04:44:57,563 --> 04:45:15,852
[SPEAKER_57]: moves to receive in place on file, and then requests that the mayor provide the council with the full description of the standards or procedures the mayor uses in determining what banners or signs will be allowed to be placed on City Hall.

3690
04:45:18,073 --> 04:45:22,275
[SPEAKER_44]: If I could just clarify the first motion, Mr. Clerk also mentioned

3691
04:45:22,985 --> 04:45:27,807
[SPEAKER_44]: paper 20-497, which was Councilor Beers' original resolution.

3692
04:45:28,367 --> 04:45:31,589
[SPEAKER_44]: So move to place 2497 on file?

3693
04:45:32,569 --> 04:45:32,749
[SPEAKER_44]: Right.

3694
04:45:32,809 --> 04:45:36,391
[SPEAKER_44]: Motion to receive and place on file the original resolution of paper 20-497.

3695
04:45:36,571 --> 04:45:43,614
[SPEAKER_57]: So is it one joint?

3696
04:45:44,094 --> 04:45:46,696
[SPEAKER_57]: My confusion, Councilor, is it one joint motion?

3697
04:45:46,716 --> 04:45:48,696
[SPEAKER_57]: No, they're two separate.

3698
04:45:48,957 --> 04:45:49,997
[SPEAKER_57]: Point of order, Mr. President.

3699
04:45:52,172 --> 04:45:55,595
[SPEAKER_41]: Could it not be addressed as strike the language in the existing ordinance and replace with?

3700
04:46:00,239 --> 04:46:01,540
[SPEAKER_36]: Can you restate that, please?

3701
04:46:02,040 --> 04:46:06,404
[SPEAKER_42]: Could it not be addressed as strike the language in the existing paper and replace it with the following amendment?

3702
04:46:08,185 --> 04:46:10,407
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I think that is something that could be done.

3703
04:46:10,427 --> 04:46:13,089
[SPEAKER_44]: I prefer we go what we have, Mr. President.

3704
04:46:13,129 --> 04:46:15,711
[SPEAKER_44]: That's what was seconded, and that's what I prefer we go with.

3705
04:46:16,332 --> 04:46:16,712
[SPEAKER_55]: So be it.

3706
04:46:17,967 --> 04:46:23,389
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, I'd like to move to amend to ask the clerk to check the recording to see if this motion is in order.

3707
04:46:25,850 --> 04:46:26,750
[SPEAKER_41]: Point of order, Mr. President.

3708
04:46:27,190 --> 04:46:28,211
[SPEAKER_37]: Point of order, Councilor Knight.

3709
04:46:31,552 --> 04:46:33,793
[SPEAKER_41]: The proper procedure would be to question the ruling of the chair.

3710
04:46:34,533 --> 04:46:36,734
[SPEAKER_43]: The chair is the parliamentarian of the meeting.

3711
04:46:36,834 --> 04:46:39,095
[SPEAKER_43]: The chair has relied on the opinion of the city clerk.

3712
04:46:39,775 --> 04:46:40,836
[SPEAKER_43]: The city clerk has made that.

3713
04:46:40,956 --> 04:46:47,258
[SPEAKER_43]: Now, if the gentleman wants to question the ruling of the chair, then he would have to make that motion and question the ruling of the chair.

3714
04:46:47,762 --> 04:46:55,456
[SPEAKER_43]: here on the floor at which time we would vote as a council as to whether or not we support the decision that the city, that the council president made or not.

3715
04:46:57,179 --> 04:46:59,544
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Pierce, I have in my notes here that

3716
04:47:00,896 --> 04:47:09,162
[SPEAKER_37]: There's, I have nothing, so what happens is my notes here, I usually write down, it says offered by Councilor Beers, and I usually put slash in whoever makes the second.

3717
04:47:09,922 --> 04:47:11,663
[SPEAKER_37]: I have no slash, I have no second.

3718
04:47:11,944 --> 04:47:17,808
[SPEAKER_37]: And then I have Councilor Marks, he made his resolution and it was seconded by Vice President Carbiello.

3719
04:47:20,129 --> 04:47:21,150
[SPEAKER_29]: That's fine, Mr. President.

3720
04:47:21,210 --> 04:47:26,353
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not gonna challenge your ruling once again, because I know I'll lose, but I will bring it up when we discuss the records next month.

3721
04:47:26,393 --> 04:47:26,734
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3722
04:47:27,254 --> 04:47:27,614
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

3723
04:47:29,155 --> 04:47:30,056
[SPEAKER_29]: There's no Mr. Ripley.

3724
04:47:32,819 --> 04:47:35,281
[SPEAKER_29]: So there is there is truth and truth and falsehood.

3725
04:47:35,761 --> 04:47:38,883
[SPEAKER_38]: Clerk Eredes, please call the roll.

3726
04:47:42,245 --> 04:47:42,905
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Beres.

3727
04:47:43,205 --> 04:47:45,867
[SPEAKER_44]: This is on the first one.

3728
04:47:45,947 --> 04:47:46,908
[SPEAKER_44]: Hang on a second.

3729
04:47:46,928 --> 04:47:48,348
[SPEAKER_44]: There's two separate motions.

3730
04:47:48,368 --> 04:47:51,770
[SPEAKER_44]: This is the first motion to receive the paper in place on file.

3731
04:47:52,151 --> 04:47:54,192
[SPEAKER_44]: And the second motion is the request to the mayor.

3732
04:47:55,513 --> 04:47:55,773
[SPEAKER_57]: Correct?

3733
04:47:56,994 --> 04:48:01,758
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, first one is to receive 2497 and place on file.

3734
04:48:01,958 --> 04:48:02,339
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you.

3735
04:48:02,519 --> 04:48:02,859
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you.

3736
04:48:08,384 --> 04:48:09,004
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs?

3737
04:48:10,025 --> 04:48:10,325
[SPEAKER_57]: No.

3738
04:48:12,627 --> 04:48:13,548
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Caraballo?

3739
04:48:13,868 --> 04:48:14,068
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3740
04:48:16,551 --> 04:48:17,071
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

3741
04:48:17,431 --> 04:48:17,752
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3742
04:48:20,634 --> 04:48:21,214
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks?

3743
04:48:21,835 --> 04:48:22,095
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3744
04:48:23,857 --> 04:48:24,497
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell?

3745
04:48:25,118 --> 04:48:25,238
[SPEAKER_57]: No.

3746
04:48:27,728 --> 04:48:28,548
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3747
04:48:29,348 --> 04:48:29,568
[SPEAKER_57]: Yeah.

3748
04:48:33,429 --> 04:48:34,150
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco?

3749
04:48:35,170 --> 04:48:37,951
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes.

3750
04:48:42,732 --> 04:48:48,433
[SPEAKER_41]: Motion to suspend the rules to take communications from the mayor, Mr. President.

3751
04:48:49,354 --> 04:48:51,634
[SPEAKER_44]: No, we still have the second part of this vote.

3752
04:48:51,654 --> 04:48:53,015
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm sorry, I thought that was a joint vote.

3753
04:48:53,055 --> 04:48:54,435
[SPEAKER_44]: It is a part two minutes.

3754
04:49:09,701 --> 04:49:12,804
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk, do you want to read the motion?

3755
04:49:18,928 --> 04:49:19,129
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3756
04:49:19,969 --> 04:49:29,177
[SPEAKER_57]: After the motion to receive 2497 placed on file, Councilor Marks moved to request that the mayor provide the council

3757
04:49:30,643 --> 04:49:39,948
[SPEAKER_57]: with the full description of standards or procedures the mayor uses in determining what banners or signs will be allowed to be placed on City Hall.

3758
04:49:42,710 --> 04:49:44,511
[SPEAKER_37]: On that motion, Clerk Hertoghez, please call the roll.

3759
04:49:45,672 --> 04:49:46,532
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there a second on that?

3760
04:49:47,032 --> 04:49:48,193
[SPEAKER_37]: There was a second.

3761
04:49:48,793 --> 04:49:49,694
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Caviello.

3762
04:49:51,335 --> 04:49:52,736
[SPEAKER_29]: Could you reread the motion, Mr. Clerk?

3763
04:49:54,697 --> 04:49:54,937
[SPEAKER_38]: Sure.

3764
04:50:01,725 --> 04:50:13,593
[SPEAKER_57]: The motion is requesting that the mayor provide the council with the full description of the standards or procedures the mayor uses in determining what banners or signs will be allowed to be placed on City Hall.

3765
04:50:17,355 --> 04:50:17,956
[SPEAKER_57]: On that motion.

3766
04:50:24,760 --> 04:50:25,901
[SPEAKER_38]: Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

3767
04:50:28,243 --> 04:50:28,823
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs?

3768
04:50:29,824 --> 04:50:30,024
[SPEAKER_57]: No.

3769
04:50:33,612 --> 04:50:34,492
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Carabiello?

3770
04:50:34,812 --> 04:50:35,032
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3771
04:50:38,613 --> 04:50:39,114
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Knight?

3772
04:50:39,554 --> 04:50:39,774
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

3773
04:50:42,795 --> 04:50:43,355
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Marks?

3774
04:50:43,835 --> 04:50:44,095
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

3775
04:50:47,836 --> 04:50:48,456
[SPEAKER_55]: Councilor Morrell?

3776
04:50:48,996 --> 04:50:49,197
[SPEAKER_55]: No.

3777
04:50:52,237 --> 04:50:52,998
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3778
04:50:54,038 --> 04:50:54,298
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3779
04:50:57,019 --> 04:50:57,719
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco?

3780
04:50:58,499 --> 04:50:58,699
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

3781
04:50:58,719 --> 04:51:00,160
[SPEAKER_37]: 5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative.

3782
04:51:00,180 --> 04:51:01,020
[SPEAKER_37]: The motion passes.

3783
04:51:04,955 --> 04:51:28,106
[SPEAKER_37]: 20-498 offered by Council of Bears be resolved by the Memphis City Council that the mayor and health director provide an update on the reopening plan proposed by Texas University, collaboration between the university and health officials, and how the Memphis community will be kept safe with hundreds of out-of-state students returned to the city from COVID-19 hotspots.

3784
04:51:28,406 --> 04:51:29,127
[SPEAKER_37]: Council of Bears.

3785
04:51:30,687 --> 04:51:31,628
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3786
04:51:32,839 --> 04:51:34,780
[SPEAKER_29]: As we're aware, we're in the midst of a global pandemic.

3787
04:51:35,940 --> 04:51:45,064
[SPEAKER_29]: The governor of the Commonwealth has abdicated his responsibility to provide clear guidelines for both elementary and secondary education, as well as our institutions of higher learning.

3788
04:51:45,845 --> 04:51:52,007
[SPEAKER_29]: So I have heard from many residents who are deeply concerned about the reopening plan that's been proposed by Tufts University.

3789
04:51:52,968 --> 04:52:00,551
[SPEAKER_29]: I do want to also mention that the mayor and the mayor's office has sent a letter to President Monaco at Tufts and also

3790
04:52:00,987 --> 04:52:03,348
[SPEAKER_29]: that the mayor has received a response to that letter.

3791
04:52:04,288 --> 04:52:06,569
[SPEAKER_29]: So there has been some communication.

3792
04:52:07,449 --> 04:52:21,113
[SPEAKER_29]: I would like to ask either if Chief of Staff Rodriguez has anything quickly now or in a written update that we get information on exactly how the mayor and the health director were consulted by the university.

3793
04:52:21,573 --> 04:52:25,034
[SPEAKER_29]: Was there an approval process that the city had to approve the reopening plan or not?

3794
04:52:26,234 --> 04:52:27,695
[SPEAKER_29]: What did that consultation look like?

3795
04:52:28,979 --> 04:52:38,325
[SPEAKER_29]: I think the big unanswered question, which is what happens if there is an outbreak or, you know, what happens if this doesn't go the way that Tufts is expecting it to go?

3796
04:52:38,645 --> 04:52:40,206
[SPEAKER_29]: I spoke with Rocco DiRico.

3797
04:52:40,846 --> 04:52:47,891
[SPEAKER_29]: He mentioned that, you know, he kind of outlined similarly to the response that was sent to the mayor, what their plan is.

3798
04:52:49,192 --> 04:52:56,176
[SPEAKER_29]: I felt slightly better, but I would just say again that the uncertainty is so great that bringing this many people back seems

3799
04:52:56,749 --> 04:52:57,850
[SPEAKER_29]: potentially unwise to me.

3800
04:52:58,030 --> 04:53:00,452
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's the intent of this resolution.

3801
04:53:04,176 --> 04:53:05,216
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see.

3802
04:53:05,817 --> 04:53:06,417
[SPEAKER_58]: Move approval.

3803
04:53:06,958 --> 04:53:08,940
[SPEAKER_37]: Dave, I'm not sure if you wanted to comment on that.

3804
04:53:08,960 --> 04:53:10,161
[SPEAKER_37]: Dave Rodriguez, Chief of Staff.

3805
04:53:10,697 --> 04:53:18,721
[SPEAKER_58]: Just very, very, very briefly, the mayor is deeply concerned about Tufts reopening plan and she's expressed that since the plan was announced to us.

3806
04:53:19,281 --> 04:53:25,144
[SPEAKER_58]: We've been in constant communication with Tufts throughout the pandemic, myself, Marian O'Connor, Jackie from our office.

3807
04:53:25,484 --> 04:53:28,445
[SPEAKER_58]: We're always talking to Tufts because Tufts doesn't exist in a vacuum.

3808
04:53:30,066 --> 04:53:31,788
[SPEAKER_58]: It's interlaced throughout the community.

3809
04:53:31,868 --> 04:53:32,408
[SPEAKER_58]: We know this.

3810
04:53:32,869 --> 04:53:34,590
[SPEAKER_58]: These students are coming back by the thousands.

3811
04:53:34,630 --> 04:53:36,152
[SPEAKER_58]: They're going to be in our neighborhoods.

3812
04:53:36,192 --> 04:53:37,273
[SPEAKER_58]: They're going to be all over the place.

3813
04:53:37,753 --> 04:53:48,343
[SPEAKER_58]: The mayor is deeply concerned about how this is going to affect a lot of folks in not just the surrounding neighborhoods directly adjacent to Tufts, but also throughout the community.

3814
04:53:50,465 --> 04:53:55,548
[SPEAKER_58]: What I will say is that the mayor pushed to have a community meeting on this so that Tufts can speak for themselves.

3815
04:53:55,968 --> 04:53:59,570
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm not gonna be Tufts spokesperson today about what their plans are.

3816
04:53:59,590 --> 04:54:04,153
[SPEAKER_58]: I will say that the Tufts is having a community meeting on August 4th at 5 p.m.

3817
04:54:04,753 --> 04:54:05,814
[SPEAKER_58]: online through Zoom.

3818
04:54:06,634 --> 04:54:11,277
[SPEAKER_58]: So when we push to have that pushed out as much as it possibly can towards the residents.

3819
04:54:11,297 --> 04:54:13,938
[SPEAKER_58]: And then if you're on the Tufts email list, you should already know about that.

3820
04:54:14,739 --> 04:54:18,681
[SPEAKER_58]: But we're also gonna push out that community meeting through the mayor's office so folks can know about it.

3821
04:54:19,381 --> 04:54:21,382
[SPEAKER_58]: There are concerns about these students coming.

3822
04:54:21,742 --> 04:54:27,085
[SPEAKER_58]: A lot of the students that have off-campus housing, a lot of them never left.

3823
04:54:27,805 --> 04:54:30,247
[SPEAKER_58]: So that's a little bit encouraging that they are here.

3824
04:54:30,687 --> 04:54:40,192
[SPEAKER_58]: But the mayor, because of these hotspots, because of these outbreaks that are happening in pretty much everywhere else but New England, New York, New Jersey, what does that look like for Medford?

3825
04:54:40,772 --> 04:54:42,153
[SPEAKER_58]: And she's very concerned about that.

3826
04:54:42,573 --> 04:54:44,894
[SPEAKER_58]: To answer the question of whether there's approval process, there wasn't.

3827
04:54:45,554 --> 04:54:50,656
[SPEAKER_58]: The Tufts is following the state guidelines for higher ed institutions.

3828
04:54:51,076 --> 04:54:53,257
[SPEAKER_58]: The city does not have any approval process in place.

3829
04:54:53,357 --> 04:54:59,219
[SPEAKER_58]: We're not empowered to approve or deny these plans outside of what's already given to us through the Board of Health.

3830
04:54:59,999 --> 04:55:05,521
[SPEAKER_58]: But we don't, those guidelines are pretty set and clear through the Board of Higher Ed and through the governor's office.

3831
04:55:08,101 --> 04:55:11,122
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

3832
04:55:11,142 --> 04:55:12,603
[SPEAKER_36]: Vice President Cardiello, you had your hand up.

3833
04:55:13,446 --> 04:55:19,927
[SPEAKER_16]: I did, Mr. President, but I was just going to mention that I know there was a meeting scheduled for August 4th at 5 o'clock.

3834
04:55:20,127 --> 04:55:21,627
[SPEAKER_16]: And Mr. Rodriguez already mentioned that.

3835
04:55:21,647 --> 04:55:22,548
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's it for me.

3836
04:55:22,788 --> 04:55:23,188
[SPEAKER_37]: That's good.

3837
04:55:23,228 --> 04:55:23,488
[SPEAKER_37]: Perfect.

3838
04:55:23,508 --> 04:55:23,928
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

3839
04:55:24,908 --> 04:55:26,148
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions from the council?

3840
04:55:28,369 --> 04:55:29,289
[SPEAKER_29]: Second, Councilor Nights.

3841
04:55:29,329 --> 04:55:29,969
[SPEAKER_29]: Move to approve.

3842
04:55:30,929 --> 04:55:31,549
[SPEAKER_37]: OK.

3843
04:55:32,109 --> 04:55:34,530
[SPEAKER_37]: Any questions from the public regarding this resolution?

3844
04:55:34,550 --> 04:55:34,590
[SPEAKER_37]: OK.

3845
04:55:35,890 --> 04:55:36,950
[SPEAKER_37]: Seeing and hearing none.

3846
04:55:37,550 --> 04:55:40,931
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Nights.

3847
04:55:40,991 --> 04:55:42,611
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, we have Laurel Ruma.

3848
04:55:43,334 --> 04:55:45,756
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, I'm sorry, missed that.

3849
04:55:47,016 --> 04:55:49,298
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you, Laurel Roma, 149 Burgett Avenue.

3850
04:55:50,678 --> 04:55:57,042
[SPEAKER_60]: So, sure, there's a public meeting on Tuesday the 4th at 530, just to correct you, Councillor.

3851
04:55:57,983 --> 04:56:02,666
[SPEAKER_60]: And all of Somerville and all of Medford are invited to attend this Zoom meeting.

3852
04:56:03,723 --> 04:56:05,246
[SPEAKER_60]: Kids start arriving on campus.

3853
04:56:05,266 --> 04:56:06,768
[SPEAKER_60]: Well, they're already here, as we know.

3854
04:56:07,350 --> 04:56:14,722
[SPEAKER_60]: There's about a dozen in the Burgadab neighborhood who walk down the street to check out the new condo, access to the gym, not wearing masks.

3855
04:56:16,209 --> 04:56:16,989
[SPEAKER_60]: going about their day.

3856
04:56:19,130 --> 04:56:22,511
[SPEAKER_60]: And the rest of the kids start coming, what, mid-August?

3857
04:56:22,751 --> 04:56:29,013
[SPEAKER_60]: So 10 days after this public meeting in which the city has no control over what happens next, then something's going to happen.

3858
04:56:29,453 --> 04:56:30,214
[SPEAKER_60]: It's ridiculous.

3859
04:56:30,294 --> 04:56:34,035
[SPEAKER_60]: And I understand everyone's flying by the seat of their pants because no one really understands what's happening.

3860
04:56:34,684 --> 04:56:37,766
[SPEAKER_60]: but we're allowing seven, what, 6,000 kids back on campus.

3861
04:56:38,626 --> 04:56:45,711
[SPEAKER_60]: And there has been very little to zero, actually zero communication from Tufts about what this means for residents.

3862
04:56:46,771 --> 04:56:50,373
[SPEAKER_60]: And those of us who live next to the university are very concerned about this.

3863
04:56:50,894 --> 04:56:56,257
[SPEAKER_60]: And I understand the city can't do much, but I'm sure would have liked to see a lot more than what has been done.

3864
04:56:56,877 --> 04:56:57,198
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

3865
04:56:57,918 --> 04:56:58,278
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

3866
04:56:59,759 --> 04:57:03,281
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll need motion of Councilor Behr, seconded by, I believe it was Councilor Knight.

3867
04:57:05,745 --> 04:57:06,325
[SPEAKER_36]: Please call the roll.

3868
04:57:07,926 --> 04:57:08,447
[SPEAKER_55]: Other way around.

3869
04:57:09,167 --> 04:57:09,707
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, I'm sorry.

3870
04:57:11,368 --> 04:57:11,949
[SPEAKER_37]: Was it the motion?

3871
04:57:13,330 --> 04:57:14,630
[SPEAKER_37]: Isn't it your resolution, Councilor Beers?

3872
04:57:14,951 --> 04:57:16,131
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's just get rid of it.

3873
04:57:16,792 --> 04:57:18,353
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Knight moved to approve, and I seconded.

3874
04:57:18,913 --> 04:57:19,253
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, OK.

3875
04:57:19,473 --> 04:57:22,575
[SPEAKER_36]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Beers, Clerk Arnabes, please call the roll.

3876
04:57:23,976 --> 04:57:24,597
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Beers?

3877
04:57:25,457 --> 04:57:25,717
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3878
04:57:26,638 --> 04:57:27,558
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Carabiello?

3879
04:57:27,819 --> 04:57:28,079
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3880
04:57:28,599 --> 04:57:29,059
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

3881
04:57:29,460 --> 04:57:29,760
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes.

3882
04:57:30,220 --> 04:57:30,820
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks?

3883
04:57:31,261 --> 04:57:31,581
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3884
04:57:32,181 --> 04:57:32,822
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell?

3885
04:57:33,422 --> 04:57:33,682
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

3886
04:57:34,162 --> 04:57:34,903
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3887
04:57:36,795 --> 04:57:38,416
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, President Falco.

3888
04:57:39,017 --> 04:57:41,538
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

3889
04:57:41,919 --> 04:57:44,781
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to suspend the rules to take communications from the mayor, Mr. President.

3890
04:57:44,801 --> 04:57:51,406
[SPEAKER_42]: We have Pam Kelly from the Council on Aging that's been with us for a very long time this evening, and I think she wants to go to bed so she can get down there tomorrow.

3891
04:57:52,827 --> 04:57:55,108
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Council, I'd like to suspend the rules.

[SPEAKER_37]: Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Medford that Article 1, Chapter 94 of the revised of the revised ordinance of the City of Medford as most recently amended is hereby further amended by the addition of two new definitions in Section 94-2 and

4044
05:07:46,725 --> 05:07:53,871
[SPEAKER_37]: adding an additional line called brewery to the principal uses set forth in the table of use regulations in section 94-148.

4045
05:07:54,891 --> 05:07:59,795
[SPEAKER_37]: The following two definitions are hereby added to section 94-2 entitled definitions.

4046
05:08:00,435 --> 05:08:14,886
[SPEAKER_37]: Brewery means an establishment primarily engaged in the production and distribution of beer, ale, and other malt beverages, which may include accessory uses such as tours of the brewery, retail sales, and or on-site consumption of the products

4047
05:08:15,724 --> 05:08:17,465
[SPEAKER_37]: For example, a tap room or tasting room.

4048
05:08:18,085 --> 05:08:27,208
[SPEAKER_37]: The facility shall hold the appropriate Commonwealth of Massachusetts brewery license, as well as any required pouring license approved by the local licensing authority.

4049
05:08:27,889 --> 05:08:33,391
[SPEAKER_37]: This facility may host marketing events, special events, and brewery tours.

4050
05:08:33,791 --> 05:08:39,713
[SPEAKER_37]: The facility may only sell beverages produced by and commercial goods branded by the brewery.

4051
05:08:40,356 --> 05:08:52,103
[SPEAKER_37]: Tasting room tap room means a room attached to a brewery that allows patrons to sample or consume bear, ale, or other malt beverages that are produced on site in accordance with general law chapter 138.

4052
05:08:52,944 --> 05:09:03,330
[SPEAKER_37]: Barrel means a container, usually cylindrical in nature, used for the storage of a malt beverage with a capacity of not more than 31 gallons.

4053
05:09:04,531 --> 05:09:09,674
[SPEAKER_37]: A line number 35B entitled brewery is hereby added to the principal uses set

4054
05:09:10,998 --> 05:09:16,322
[SPEAKER_37]: fourth in the table of use regulations in section 94-148 as follows.

4055
05:09:16,782 --> 05:09:20,865
[SPEAKER_37]: Table of use regulations in off-street parking and loading requirements.

4056
05:09:23,907 --> 05:09:25,348
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, so use brewery.

4057
05:09:25,368 --> 05:09:30,632
[SPEAKER_37]: This is communications from city officers and employees.

4058
05:09:31,112 --> 05:09:32,293
[SPEAKER_37]: Actually, yeah, so I'm sorry.

4059
05:09:34,400 --> 05:09:39,943
[SPEAKER_37]: So it's not allowed in SF1, SF2, GR&O, Apartment 1, Apartment 2, Apartment 3.

4060
05:09:40,944 --> 05:09:44,506
[SPEAKER_37]: C1, yes for breweries operating with seven barrels or under.

4061
05:09:45,227 --> 05:09:49,129
[SPEAKER_37]: SPA, for breweries operating with more than seven barrels.

4062
05:09:49,809 --> 05:09:51,050
[SPEAKER_37]: C2, it's allowable.

4063
05:09:52,191 --> 05:09:54,312
[SPEAKER_37]: I, industrial, it is allowable.

4064
05:09:55,133 --> 05:09:55,853
[SPEAKER_37]: O, yes.

4065
05:09:56,854 --> 05:09:57,814
[SPEAKER_37]: MUZ, yes.

4066
05:09:58,495 --> 05:09:59,115
[SPEAKER_37]: Parking 350.

4067
05:10:01,797 --> 05:10:03,918
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, before we start, I just need to

4068
05:10:04,409 --> 05:10:04,909
[SPEAKER_29]: say something.

4069
05:10:06,690 --> 05:10:07,090
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

4070
05:10:07,530 --> 05:10:19,915
[SPEAKER_29]: So at the previous meeting on this ordinance, I had recused myself as I was awaiting guidance from the State Ethics Commission on whether I could participate in these discussions due to an investment that I had in the Medford Brewing Company.

4071
05:10:20,555 --> 05:10:33,500
[SPEAKER_29]: I received guidance from the State Ethics Commission, which included that if I and my parents were both to divest our relatively small investments in the Medford Brewing Company, and then I were to file a disclosure with the clerk's office,

4072
05:10:33,919 --> 05:10:36,381
[SPEAKER_29]: that I would be able to participate in these discussions.

4073
05:10:36,661 --> 05:10:40,364
[SPEAKER_29]: We have divested from our investments and I have filed said disclosure with the clerk.

4074
05:10:40,424 --> 05:10:42,105
[SPEAKER_29]: So I will be participating going forward.

4075
05:10:42,166 --> 05:10:43,006
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4076
05:10:43,547 --> 05:10:44,728
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Paris.

4077
05:10:45,688 --> 05:10:48,150
[SPEAKER_31]: So we have Councilor Morrell, then Councilor Nye, Councilor Morrell.

4078
05:10:48,671 --> 05:10:49,551
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4079
05:10:49,832 --> 05:10:52,354
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd like to offer an amendment to this ordinance.

4080
05:10:52,394 --> 05:10:54,595
[SPEAKER_31]: We've had a number of residents reach out.

4081
05:10:55,396 --> 05:11:00,380
[SPEAKER_31]: It seems that we're really remiss in not including a definition for brew pub in these additional definitions.

4082
05:11:01,288 --> 05:11:05,452
[SPEAKER_31]: I do have suggested language for that when the clerk is ready.

4083
05:11:08,654 --> 05:11:09,875
[SPEAKER_33]: Clerk, are you ready?

4084
05:11:10,736 --> 05:11:10,976
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm ready.

4085
05:11:11,357 --> 05:11:15,020
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, now I have to find it, okay.

4086
05:11:15,580 --> 05:11:17,842
[SPEAKER_31]: Now I have to find it on my screen, sorry.

4087
05:11:18,422 --> 05:11:27,530
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, a brew pub is an establishment that provides full onsite meal service and is also licensed to brew beer on the premises.

4088
05:11:29,645 --> 05:11:37,450
[SPEAKER_57]: A brewpub... Can you email me the amendment when you're done reading it as well?

4089
05:11:37,470 --> 05:11:37,530
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

4090
05:11:38,050 --> 05:11:38,190
Yep.

4091
05:11:38,591 --> 05:11:43,213
[SPEAKER_57]: I can work it into the records that way when I do the records tomorrow.

4092
05:11:44,334 --> 05:11:45,975
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

4093
05:11:46,395 --> 05:11:48,076
[SPEAKER_57]: And I'll try to copy it down.

4094
05:11:48,857 --> 05:11:49,097
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

4095
05:11:49,918 --> 05:11:55,281
[SPEAKER_31]: And a brewpub shall sell 25% or more of its beer on site and

4096
05:11:55,780 --> 05:12:00,704
[SPEAKER_31]: Last, a brew pub shall be categorized as a restaurant and not as a brewery for the purposes of zoning.

4097
05:12:01,144 --> 05:12:04,406
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a number of other cities and towns, sorry, and then that's the end of that.

4098
05:12:04,726 --> 05:12:07,769
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a number of other cities and towns that have the same definition.

4099
05:12:07,889 --> 05:12:10,731
[SPEAKER_31]: It varies a little bit, but it's the same intent.

4100
05:12:10,791 --> 05:12:13,212
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think it's something we definitely need to add to this ordinance.

4101
05:12:18,976 --> 05:12:21,458
[SPEAKER_37]: That's an amendment by Councilor Morrell.

4102
05:12:22,259 --> 05:12:22,699
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

4103
05:12:23,179 --> 05:12:24,260
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

4104
05:12:24,801 --> 05:12:25,321
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Knight.

4105
05:12:26,091 --> 05:12:29,513
[SPEAKER_43]: Mr. President, this is a paper that's been two years in the making, two years in the works.

4106
05:12:30,574 --> 05:12:33,975
[SPEAKER_43]: It's gone through a very lengthy vetting process.

4107
05:12:34,916 --> 05:12:36,257
[SPEAKER_43]: I believe we started this in August of 2019.

4108
05:12:36,797 --> 05:12:39,979
[SPEAKER_43]: It went to the Community Development Board.

4109
05:12:40,139 --> 05:12:41,179
[SPEAKER_43]: It came back to the Council.

4110
05:12:42,320 --> 05:12:49,224
[SPEAKER_43]: The Council failed to act in the specified timeframes that are outlined in Chapter 48 of the General Laws.

4111
05:12:50,384 --> 05:12:55,167
[SPEAKER_43]: So as such, this paper is going to be required to be referred back again to the Community Development Board.

4112
05:12:56,222 --> 05:13:02,669
[SPEAKER_43]: because I do not believe we completed that task within the requisite 180 days from when the paper was introduced.

4113
05:13:03,590 --> 05:13:18,945
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, I respectfully request my colleague withdraw her amendment to the paper that's gone through such a lengthy vetting process, and that we send the paper to the Community Development Board for their review and recommendation, at which time it will be reported back to the council, and then we'll have a public hearing.

4114
05:13:19,702 --> 05:13:25,645
[SPEAKER_43]: And that public hearing will take place after which then we'll be able to allow, be allowed to vote on the paper for a third reading.

4115
05:13:26,405 --> 05:13:32,707
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that it might be important for us to get the solicitation from the Community Development Board on what they think about this change in the definition.

4116
05:13:33,548 --> 05:13:36,709
[SPEAKER_43]: The paper that we were working off of was based upon their previous recommendations.

4117
05:13:37,649 --> 05:13:44,092
[SPEAKER_43]: So I think that it's very important, Mr. President, if we want to keep this thing moving through the process, that we do so with post haste.

4118
05:13:44,600 --> 05:13:47,701
[SPEAKER_43]: And amending it at this level in the game I don't think is a necessary requirement.

4119
05:13:48,541 --> 05:13:48,941
[SPEAKER_43]: Number one.

4120
05:13:48,961 --> 05:14:00,523
[SPEAKER_43]: Number two, I think that when you look at the state regulations that define what a restaurant is, the Architectural Access Board has put out regulations that define what a restaurant is.

4121
05:14:00,643 --> 05:14:03,484
[SPEAKER_43]: It's 521 CMR 17.

4122
05:14:03,664 --> 05:14:10,005
[SPEAKER_43]: Restaurants shall be included, but not limited to cafeterias, lounges, bars, and other places open to the public where food and beverages sold.

4123
05:14:11,199 --> 05:14:18,263
[SPEAKER_43]: So I don't think that any place that serves food or beverage in there would be classified otherwise based upon the standard that's been established by the state.

4124
05:14:18,823 --> 05:14:22,885
[SPEAKER_43]: And we all know that the state statute would supersede any local ordinance.

4125
05:14:23,125 --> 05:14:31,150
[SPEAKER_43]: If we look at chapter 138, which is the liquor laws in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the liquor laws in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts create three definitions for breweries.

4126
05:14:31,690 --> 05:14:37,273
[SPEAKER_43]: And those three definitions are a farmer's license, a brewer's license, or a manufacturer's license, Mr. President.

4127
05:14:37,893 --> 05:14:38,694
[SPEAKER_43]: So when we're creating,

4128
05:14:40,063 --> 05:14:40,844
[SPEAKER_43]: certain definitions.

4129
05:14:41,464 --> 05:14:47,227
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that it's important that we, number one, have legal counsel be advising us and helping us draft these items.

4130
05:14:47,247 --> 05:14:52,150
[SPEAKER_43]: Number two, that we have the building commissioner present to discuss with us the impact and application.

4131
05:14:52,710 --> 05:14:54,892
[SPEAKER_43]: So at this point, I think that it's premature to amend the paper.

4132
05:14:54,912 --> 05:15:04,817
[SPEAKER_43]: I think the appropriate step that would be in line with past practice would be to refer to the community development board prior to amendment, and then we have the ability to address it going forward.

4133
05:15:04,997 --> 05:15:06,558
[SPEAKER_43]: But that's my position on it.

4134
05:15:06,638 --> 05:15:07,259
[SPEAKER_43]: I respectfully

4135
05:15:08,007 --> 05:15:13,291
[SPEAKER_43]: request that the councilor make that change, but I understand if she does not want to, and I support her opinion either way.

4136
05:15:13,951 --> 05:15:15,232
[SPEAKER_43]: So thank you very much for indulging.

4137
05:15:16,593 --> 05:15:17,454
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

4138
05:15:18,094 --> 05:15:19,615
[SPEAKER_31]: Councilor Morrell, did you want to speak?

4139
05:15:20,216 --> 05:15:28,061
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I won't withdraw the amendment, and I don't see why we can't add this amendment, and then it goes to the CD board and get their opinion on all of these pieces together.

4140
05:15:30,142 --> 05:15:33,565
[SPEAKER_31]: And just point of note, I was not on the previous council that failed to act on this.

4141
05:15:37,500 --> 05:15:39,304
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

4142
05:15:39,565 --> 05:15:40,648
[SPEAKER_36]: Questions from the councilors?

4143
05:15:43,074 --> 05:15:43,675
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President?

4144
05:15:44,337 --> 05:15:44,878
[SPEAKER_44]: Council Marks?

4145
05:15:46,935 --> 05:15:49,276
[SPEAKER_44]: I disagree with my colleague, Councilor Knight.

4146
05:15:49,716 --> 05:15:52,137
[SPEAKER_44]: I believe that this is an appropriate time.

4147
05:15:53,017 --> 05:16:08,024
[SPEAKER_44]: The paper is currently before the council, and if we want to get it properly vetted through the Community Development Board, which would be a public hearing through the Community Development Board, I think this would be an ideal time, actually, to get this particular language vetted.

4148
05:16:08,405 --> 05:16:13,367
[SPEAKER_44]: And then it has to come back to us, and we can have our legal counsel, Kim Scanlon and KP Law,

4149
05:16:13,747 --> 05:16:15,828
[SPEAKER_44]: take a look at the language to make sure it's appropriate.

4150
05:16:16,428 --> 05:16:23,492
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm under the impression that the city of Boston has a similar language, if not exact language, that mirrors this.

4151
05:16:24,252 --> 05:16:38,839
[SPEAKER_44]: And I believe it spells out a concern that we have for clarification that a brew pub would be listed as a restaurant, and that's based on the sale of 25% or more of its beer on site.

4152
05:16:39,319 --> 05:16:43,682
[SPEAKER_44]: And I think that's a great distinction and something that's needed in our community.

4153
05:16:44,323 --> 05:16:47,065
[SPEAKER_44]: And so I would support moving this forward tonight.

4154
05:16:48,866 --> 05:16:49,887
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

4155
05:16:52,369 --> 05:16:54,410
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, any other questions from the council?

4156
05:16:54,871 --> 05:16:55,291
[SPEAKER_37]: Comments?

4157
05:16:57,833 --> 05:16:59,134
[SPEAKER_37]: Any comments from the public?

4158
05:17:04,177 --> 05:17:06,279
[SPEAKER_37]: Max, name and address the record, please.

4159
05:17:07,614 --> 05:17:12,357
[SPEAKER_46]: So my name is Max Heinegg, Arden Road, Medford, Mass.

4160
05:17:12,397 --> 05:17:13,117
[SPEAKER_46]: Can you hear me all right?

4161
05:17:13,537 --> 05:17:13,757
Yes.

4162
05:17:14,598 --> 05:17:15,058
[SPEAKER_46]: OK, great.

4163
05:17:15,678 --> 05:17:22,022
[SPEAKER_46]: So basically, I'm the co-founder of Medford Brewing Company, and what

4164
05:17:22,995 --> 05:17:30,125
[SPEAKER_46]: This amendment would allow us to do would be to basically, you know, open up.

4165
05:17:30,745 --> 05:17:40,138
[SPEAKER_46]: If we were zoned correctly, zoned as a restaurant, we'd be able to open up a place to serve the community and to basically, you know,

4166
05:17:41,039 --> 05:17:45,262
[SPEAKER_46]: follow all the regulations in terms of how much beer would be made.

4167
05:17:46,003 --> 05:17:58,492
[SPEAKER_46]: But basically to serve food and to be zoned the way that brewpubs are zoned in Boston as essentially a place where you can both get food and also have a drink.

4168
05:17:58,712 --> 05:18:07,138
[SPEAKER_46]: And I've been in constant contact with Alicia Hunt and basically spoken about some of the concerns.

4169
05:18:07,818 --> 05:18:08,499
[SPEAKER_46]: And I feel like

4170
05:18:09,460 --> 05:18:13,263
[SPEAKER_46]: I feel like we would make a really positive contribution to the community.

4171
05:18:13,984 --> 05:18:23,752
[SPEAKER_46]: The people who live in the neighborhood that I've spoken to are very positive about the possibility of us finally getting a brick and mortar place in Medford.

4172
05:18:24,513 --> 05:18:25,794
[SPEAKER_46]: We're excited to get started.

4173
05:18:26,274 --> 05:18:33,901
[SPEAKER_46]: And we feel like at this time, so many people are kind of hesitant to start a new business.

4174
05:18:34,502 --> 05:18:54,457
[SPEAKER_46]: We feel like we'd like to give it a shot and having the support of the council and the support of the city and letting us sort of get going as opposed to kind of continuing to drag our feet over the definition I think we can all agree upon, which is that a brew pub has food and drink and is not just a brewery.

4175
05:18:54,797 --> 05:19:00,202
[SPEAKER_46]: We're talking about a really small location that wouldn't be making a monstrous amount of beer or be open very late.

4176
05:19:00,802 --> 05:19:03,004
[SPEAKER_46]: I think most people in Medford would agree that it would be

4177
05:19:04,087 --> 05:19:07,108
[SPEAKER_46]: you know, an idea that whose time has come.

4178
05:19:07,488 --> 05:19:14,492
[SPEAKER_46]: And I really appreciate you talking to me about it tonight, talking to all of us about it tonight.

4179
05:19:14,652 --> 05:19:17,793
[SPEAKER_46]: And I appreciate the support so far.

4180
05:19:18,233 --> 05:19:18,693
[SPEAKER_46]: So thanks.

4181
05:19:21,795 --> 05:19:22,315
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Max.

4182
05:19:23,195 --> 05:19:24,716
[SPEAKER_35]: Let's see, we have a number of people that want to speak.

4183
05:19:25,236 --> 05:19:28,898
[SPEAKER_35]: So we have, let's see, Laura Ruma, name and address for the record, please.

4184
05:19:29,648 --> 05:19:31,468
[SPEAKER_60]: Rural Ramon 149 Burgett Avenue.

4185
05:19:32,389 --> 05:19:57,874
[SPEAKER_60]: As someone who helped the Licensing Commission start the proper language for this two years ago, and with you, Councilor Knight, we've been wanting this for a very long time and this, however, it would be nice to actually get this going and moving and do the next phase because we have been so held up time and time again trying to get this particular resolution passed.

4186
05:19:58,689 --> 05:20:04,194
[SPEAKER_60]: So I am siding tonight with Councilor Marks and saying we should really just push this through.

4187
05:20:04,214 --> 05:20:09,398
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

4188
05:20:10,959 --> 05:20:22,889
[SPEAKER_43]: So if we classify breweries as restaurants or brew pubs as restaurants, then they'd fall outside the brewery ordinance because they'd fall under the restaurant ordinance, which looks like it's used number 56 on a table of use chart.

4189
05:20:28,086 --> 05:20:30,447
[SPEAKER_43]: which would be retail sales and consumer services.

4190
05:20:31,027 --> 05:20:39,670
[SPEAKER_43]: So by right, by right, as a restaurant, in C1, C2, you're allowed.

4191
05:20:41,611 --> 05:20:44,112
[SPEAKER_43]: In industrial, it's a special permit by the council.

4192
05:20:44,592 --> 05:20:46,913
[SPEAKER_43]: In an office, it's a special permit by the council.

4193
05:20:46,933 --> 05:20:48,834
[SPEAKER_43]: In a mixed use, it's allowed.

4194
05:20:49,594 --> 05:20:52,035
[SPEAKER_43]: In an apartment, too, it's a special permit by the council.

4195
05:20:53,055 --> 05:20:57,377
[SPEAKER_43]: So you're confused as to what the amendment does.

4196
05:20:58,140 --> 05:21:05,066
[SPEAKER_43]: I mean, if we're defining that a brew pub is a restaurant, then it would operate outside the scope of the brewery ordinance.

4197
05:21:05,987 --> 05:21:09,409
[SPEAKER_43]: Are we amending the brewery ordinance to define brew pubs as restaurants?

4198
05:21:10,510 --> 05:21:24,342
[SPEAKER_43]: If we do that, are we amending the table of use chart to require that they fall under the new draft that's been put out, or are we asking that they be addressed under use 56 in our existing zoning use chart?

4199
05:21:25,516 --> 05:21:29,618
[SPEAKER_43]: What is it exactly that we're amending here to allow for this to happen?

4200
05:21:29,718 --> 05:21:45,326
[SPEAKER_43]: And if in fact we do amend the ordinance and change this definition, are we allowing brew pubs in areas that we've already vetted prior that would require a special permit or require certain restrictions on brewing?

4201
05:21:45,866 --> 05:21:54,030
[SPEAKER_43]: In the C-1, for example, there's restrictions on barrels and the number of barrels you can brew without a special permit and by right.

4202
05:21:54,414 --> 05:21:59,396
[SPEAKER_43]: But if we look at the use chart for restaurants, there is no restriction.

4203
05:22:00,676 --> 05:22:10,479
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'm confused by the amendment probably because I haven't been able to see it in writing and to see what exactly it does mechanically or operationally.

4204
05:22:12,099 --> 05:22:14,780
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'm not comfortable supporting it this evening, Mr. President.

4205
05:22:14,880 --> 05:22:23,463
[SPEAKER_43]: And I was the sponsor of bringing the brewery on the first paper I filed at the beginning of this term was to give CP out of the brewery ordinance and bring it back to life.

4206
05:22:24,150 --> 05:22:30,617
[SPEAKER_41]: The other one I filed was for food trucks, two things that should have been done long ago, long ago, Mr. President.

4207
05:22:30,677 --> 05:22:34,961
[SPEAKER_43]: But I mean, I think that if we're going to do it, we got to do it right.

4208
05:22:35,422 --> 05:22:41,508
[SPEAKER_43]: And we've gone through a process here that's taken almost a year, 11 months, and we've made great progress.

4209
05:22:42,650 --> 05:22:45,633
[SPEAKER_43]: And I am very uncomfortable voting on this

4210
05:22:46,607 --> 05:22:48,108
[SPEAKER_43]: at this late with these amendments.

4211
05:22:48,148 --> 05:22:51,570
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm just not comfortable doing it because of the questions that I just raised.

4212
05:22:51,650 --> 05:22:55,653
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, legal counsel has to vet the language to make sure we're not doing anything contrary to law.

4213
05:22:55,973 --> 05:22:57,574
[SPEAKER_43]: If we are, we've got to go back to the drawing board.

4214
05:22:57,674 --> 05:23:00,636
[SPEAKER_43]: If we are, you know, we're put in a worse position, Mr. President.

4215
05:23:00,656 --> 05:23:05,880
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'd ask that the amendments be introduced after maybe they're referred to legal counsel and then we can introduce them or attach them at a later date.

4216
05:23:06,660 --> 05:23:08,081
[SPEAKER_44]: Point of information, Mr. President.

4217
05:23:08,902 --> 05:23:10,303
[SPEAKER_44]: Point of information, Counselor Marks.

4218
05:23:11,581 --> 05:23:22,146
[SPEAKER_44]: I thought what was mentioned at the outset that we have to go through this process all over again anyways, because we didn't make the time constraints that were imposed on this council.

4219
05:23:22,566 --> 05:23:32,591
[SPEAKER_44]: So this is nothing more than adding a definition to the current brewing ordinance that we have that's going to probably be vetted once again.

4220
05:23:32,611 --> 05:23:37,673
[SPEAKER_44]: And if anything, Mr. President, this is merely stating that

4221
05:23:41,033 --> 05:23:46,835
[SPEAKER_44]: Food will be 75% of what's sold in the establishment, which would make it a restaurant.

4222
05:23:47,370 --> 05:23:51,131
[SPEAKER_44]: And only 25% can be of a brewing nature.

4223
05:23:51,611 --> 05:24:00,213
[SPEAKER_44]: So it's actually very different than the other definitions, where it heavily relies on the brewing and not the food.

4224
05:24:00,733 --> 05:24:04,714
[SPEAKER_44]: And so this is more food-related than it is brewing.

4225
05:24:05,134 --> 05:24:09,935
[SPEAKER_44]: And I think it fits well into this, because it gives people an option, Mr. President.

4226
05:24:10,335 --> 05:24:13,596
[SPEAKER_44]: So I think it will probably be vetted out as we go along.

4227
05:24:13,936 --> 05:24:15,536
[SPEAKER_44]: So I will support it tonight.

4228
05:24:15,876 --> 05:24:22,039
[SPEAKER_44]: knowing that we still have many meetings in front of us, Mr. President, to go forward with this.

4229
05:24:23,279 --> 05:24:33,464
[SPEAKER_43]: I just do think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that the unamended paper before us is the paper that the council had reported out favorably and has to be placed on the agenda.

4230
05:24:34,211 --> 05:24:38,993
[SPEAKER_43]: The legislative process allows for amendments to be made, but the paper that's before us is the paper that the council voted on.

4231
05:24:39,793 --> 05:24:44,795
[SPEAKER_43]: The amendments weren't adopted through the committee of the whole process or the proper vetting process that's been established previously.

4232
05:24:45,155 --> 05:24:46,436
[SPEAKER_43]: It's for those reasons that I will be in.

4233
05:24:46,456 --> 05:24:54,119
[SPEAKER_43]: The uncertainty as to how this amendment will impact the zoning use chart and the application of the special permit process, for those reasons, I'll be voting against it this evening.

4234
05:24:54,719 --> 05:25:01,401
[SPEAKER_43]: I support breweries, I was the sponsor of the resolution, but I didn't understand when I got emails today, I didn't understand what they were talking about.

4235
05:25:01,442 --> 05:25:02,622
[SPEAKER_43]: Support the Medford brewing,

4236
05:25:03,573 --> 05:25:03,993
[SPEAKER_43]: amendment.

4237
05:25:04,774 --> 05:25:05,715
[SPEAKER_43]: I didn't know what that meant.

4238
05:25:06,035 --> 05:25:15,665
[SPEAKER_43]: I thought we were making an ordinance for breweries in the city of Medford, and apparently this is an amendment for Medford brewing, which was my misconception.

4239
05:25:15,685 --> 05:25:21,350
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'll rest my case, Mr. President.

4240
05:25:21,410 --> 05:25:24,613
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm not comfortable voting for it this evening for the reasons that I stated, and so be it.

4241
05:25:25,366 --> 05:25:34,173
[SPEAKER_43]: But it's definitely a worthy endeavor and just something that, you know, once it gets through the process for a third reading, you know, I'll be happy to vote for it after I understand it a little bit better.

4242
05:25:34,193 --> 05:25:35,774
[SPEAKER_43]: But as of right now, I'm not comfortable doing so.

4243
05:25:36,901 --> 05:25:56,755
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President, just if I could add, we were fortunate enough, and I appreciate all the work Council and I did on this, believe me, and other members of the council, we put a lot of time and effort into this, as well as Mark Rumley, former city solicitor, who actually got this ball rolling as well, Mr. President.

4244
05:25:57,135 --> 05:26:01,338
[SPEAKER_44]: But we were fortunate enough to have a couple of Method residents,

4245
05:26:01,838 --> 05:26:09,424
[SPEAKER_44]: that are in the brewing business to assist us and help us along in crafting this ordinance to make it work for the city of Method.

4246
05:26:09,865 --> 05:26:27,400
[SPEAKER_44]: So I only see that as a positive that we had the ability to have someone there give us some guidance and there was many times that we asked for guidance to make sure we crafted something that wasn't a Somerville ordinance or Cambridge or Boston but a Method ordinance to see how it worked for us.

4247
05:26:28,040 --> 05:26:28,861
[SPEAKER_44]: And so

4248
05:26:29,801 --> 05:26:38,345
[SPEAKER_44]: I continue to look for advice and assistance and any other assistance I can get from the people that have the expertise.

4249
05:26:39,166 --> 05:26:44,128
[SPEAKER_44]: Because I'm not a brewing expert, I don't know the number of barrels, I don't know anything that...

4250
05:26:44,548 --> 05:26:46,349
[SPEAKER_44]: what I have to do my homework and research.

4251
05:26:46,870 --> 05:26:50,733
[SPEAKER_44]: And from what I see with this, Mr. President, it will be properly vetted.

4252
05:26:50,993 --> 05:26:57,057
[SPEAKER_44]: We're not asking that this be voted on tonight and then become an ordinance, ordained ordinance, in the next several weeks.

4253
05:26:57,377 --> 05:27:00,620
[SPEAKER_44]: We're saying that this has to go through the entire process again.

4254
05:27:01,020 --> 05:27:02,221
[SPEAKER_44]: Unfortunately, we have to do it.

4255
05:27:02,501 --> 05:27:06,604
[SPEAKER_44]: We have to go through the entire process and have another public hearing and so forth.

4256
05:27:07,425 --> 05:27:09,206
[SPEAKER_44]: Even though much of the language has been vetted out,

4257
05:27:10,574 --> 05:27:18,482
[SPEAKER_44]: So I hear what Councilor Knight's saying, but I think we should at least give this the opportunity to be added and then properly vetted.

4258
05:27:19,263 --> 05:27:21,566
[SPEAKER_43]: No more than a procedural difference, Mr. President, that's all.

4259
05:27:23,120 --> 05:27:24,001
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

4260
05:27:24,081 --> 05:27:25,022
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

4261
05:27:25,122 --> 05:27:26,843
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Caviello would like to speak.

4262
05:27:26,883 --> 05:27:29,826
[SPEAKER_37]: I know there's some residents that want to speak as well, and we'll make sure we get to you.

4263
05:27:29,866 --> 05:27:32,248
[SPEAKER_37]: But yeah, Vice President Caviello.

4264
05:27:32,548 --> 05:27:33,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4265
05:27:33,849 --> 05:27:35,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I support this move here.

4266
05:27:37,893 --> 05:27:38,593
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't understand.

4267
05:27:38,874 --> 05:27:43,317
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we're calling it a brew pub, it's a brewery that serves food.

4268
05:27:43,358 --> 05:27:43,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I correct?

4269
05:27:48,044 --> 05:27:59,008
[SPEAKER_16]: To simplify the matter, why doesn't Mr. Hennig just buy a restaurant and apply for a beer and wine license and bring his beer in there and sell it off tap?

4270
05:28:00,329 --> 05:28:02,690
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that would sort of simplify the process to him.

4271
05:28:04,450 --> 05:28:16,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I'm missing something there, but I say, I know the property they wanna buy and I say, they open up a restaurant, they get a beer and wine license and they bring in their beer and they sell it there.

4272
05:28:18,584 --> 05:28:20,665
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I incorrect in what I'm saying?

4273
05:28:21,966 --> 05:28:25,148
[SPEAKER_16]: I think someone wants to respond to your question, Carl.

4274
05:28:25,168 --> 05:28:27,049
[SPEAKER_37]: Nick, maybe you want to respond to that.

4275
05:28:27,469 --> 05:28:28,530
[SPEAKER_37]: So we have Nick.

4276
05:28:28,570 --> 05:28:29,991
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, Nick.

4277
05:28:32,752 --> 05:28:33,693
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm trying to unmute you, Nick.

4278
05:28:33,773 --> 05:28:34,093
[SPEAKER_37]: One minute.

4279
05:28:36,234 --> 05:28:36,634
[SPEAKER_61]: Are we there?

4280
05:28:37,395 --> 05:28:38,175
[SPEAKER_61]: Name and address, please.

4281
05:28:38,455 --> 05:28:38,696
[SPEAKER_61]: Excellent.

4282
05:28:38,736 --> 05:28:41,397
[SPEAKER_61]: My name is Nick Belytha of 20 Dutton Circle in Medford.

4283
05:28:42,198 --> 05:28:45,459
[SPEAKER_61]: Yeah, again, thank you everyone, obviously, for listening to us.

4284
05:28:47,512 --> 05:28:51,575
[SPEAKER_61]: Again, yeah, I mean, the reality is we're trying to open a small business.

4285
05:28:52,636 --> 05:28:54,037
[SPEAKER_61]: We've been working in the community.

4286
05:28:54,197 --> 05:28:56,719
[SPEAKER_61]: We are entirely community founded.

4287
05:28:58,541 --> 05:29:01,303
[SPEAKER_61]: And everything we do is all about the community.

4288
05:29:01,924 --> 05:29:08,489
[SPEAKER_61]: We want to build a place that basically people in the community can come to, they can hang out, they can enjoy themselves.

4289
05:29:08,871 --> 05:29:10,052
[SPEAKER_61]: We make beer.

4290
05:29:11,112 --> 05:29:15,974
[SPEAKER_61]: As the Councillor pointed out, yes, we want to buy a restaurant that's currently zoned as a restaurant.

4291
05:29:16,675 --> 05:29:23,378
[SPEAKER_61]: And yes, we want to make our beer and serve our beer, the Medford beer, in that restaurant.

4292
05:29:24,358 --> 05:29:26,900
[SPEAKER_61]: And that's really what we would like to do.

4293
05:29:27,700 --> 05:29:35,446
[SPEAKER_61]: Not only that, but this also then allows other potential brewing-type companies to do a similar thing.

4294
05:29:35,466 --> 05:29:48,176
[SPEAKER_61]: I mean, the reality is right now I'm hearing everything about the tax problems, there's not enough money coming in, there are no businesses being started, and Councillor Knight, for example, is very, very keen to tell us how his

4295
05:29:48,576 --> 05:29:59,221
[SPEAKER_61]: very forthcoming with everything, but sadly everything he seems to say is actually quite negative versus let's look at the positives here of what we're trying to achieve overall in what we do.

4296
05:29:59,322 --> 05:30:14,569
[SPEAKER_61]: Now I understand process and perhaps I shouldn't say this at this stage, but I was very disheartened at the last meeting where a certain thing was seconded and then when it didn't go the certain way of someone then they decided then to pull the it's been too late to do this.

4297
05:30:16,310 --> 05:30:17,571
[SPEAKER_61]: But that aside,

4298
05:30:18,351 --> 05:30:31,955
[SPEAKER_61]: The reality is we are looking to open a small business in Medford that celebrates Medford, that our products are named after ships built in Medford.

4299
05:30:32,415 --> 05:30:35,136
[SPEAKER_61]: Our latest product, for example, is called Phantom.

4300
05:30:35,436 --> 05:30:37,917
[SPEAKER_61]: The Phantom is a ship built in Medford.

4301
05:30:38,257 --> 05:30:39,818
[SPEAKER_61]: Our logo is the president.

4302
05:30:40,058 --> 05:30:40,518
[SPEAKER_61]: Guess what?

4303
05:30:40,758 --> 05:30:43,179
[SPEAKER_61]: Another clipper ship made in Medford.

4304
05:30:43,719 --> 05:30:46,860
[SPEAKER_61]: Our company is called the Medford Brewing Company.

4305
05:30:47,628 --> 05:30:50,229
[SPEAKER_61]: What we're asking for is not anything crazy.

4306
05:30:50,849 --> 05:30:57,171
[SPEAKER_61]: What we're asking for is for essentially, we're looking at, we found a location that people loved for 30 years.

4307
05:30:57,452 --> 05:31:00,833
[SPEAKER_61]: It was a restaurant, it's in a weird zoning location.

4308
05:31:01,293 --> 05:31:09,216
[SPEAKER_61]: And so realistically, what I'm saying is, we said, we would like to purchase this, restart a Medford business.

4309
05:31:09,516 --> 05:31:12,277
[SPEAKER_61]: I mean, I hate to say it, how many businesses are opening in Medford right now?

4310
05:31:14,083 --> 05:31:20,788
[SPEAKER_61]: Are we pro-business in a city or are we, no, let's just hide behind some tape that we can pull here and we can do these things?

4311
05:31:21,008 --> 05:31:36,740
[SPEAKER_61]: These are the questions because quite honestly, we're at a stage now where the Medford Brewing Company might have to stop being the Medford Brewing Company and move to another city where we're actually allowed to operate and try and do something for that city.

4312
05:31:37,250 --> 05:31:38,852
[SPEAKER_61]: That's not what I want to do.

4313
05:31:38,872 --> 05:31:40,493
[SPEAKER_61]: That's not what we should be doing.

4314
05:31:40,713 --> 05:31:47,360
[SPEAKER_61]: But quite honestly, we had an ordinance that was in front of you guys before that was just dropped and ignored and forgotten.

4315
05:31:47,700 --> 05:31:49,762
[SPEAKER_61]: And then the card pulled, you missed your date.

4316
05:31:50,062 --> 05:31:51,003
[SPEAKER_61]: That wasn't our fault.

4317
05:31:51,303 --> 05:31:52,324
[SPEAKER_61]: We nudged you guys.

4318
05:31:52,564 --> 05:31:53,886
[SPEAKER_61]: We pushed things with you guys.

4319
05:31:54,566 --> 05:31:55,147
[SPEAKER_61]: We asked.

4320
05:31:55,447 --> 05:31:56,468
[SPEAKER_61]: We sent you information.

4321
05:31:57,029 --> 05:31:58,430
[SPEAKER_61]: And we got nothing back.

4322
05:31:59,262 --> 05:32:01,924
[SPEAKER_37]: If I may, if I may.

4323
05:32:02,124 --> 05:32:03,804
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, there are a lot of things that went into that.

4324
05:32:03,905 --> 05:32:08,207
[SPEAKER_37]: And it's not full blame on the council because we had numerous meetings on this.

4325
05:32:08,607 --> 05:32:15,731
[SPEAKER_37]: And it was basically stated that one of the big things was the Chamber of Commerce was going to come in and wanted to weigh in on it.

4326
05:32:16,131 --> 05:32:21,193
[SPEAKER_37]: And what happened was, they didn't they postponed their meeting, which was supposed to be in November.

4327
05:32:21,313 --> 05:32:22,734
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think it was after the fact.

4328
05:32:23,094 --> 05:32:27,397
[SPEAKER_37]: So that got she wasn't fully on the council that was not fully on the council.

4329
05:32:27,417 --> 05:32:27,957
[SPEAKER_37]: But I just want to

4330
05:32:28,397 --> 05:32:29,138
[SPEAKER_37]: straight that out.

4331
05:32:29,538 --> 05:32:37,346
[SPEAKER_61]: President, I'm not looking for people saying why it wasn't anyone's fault or anything else.

4332
05:32:37,666 --> 05:32:38,346
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm not saying it is.

4333
05:32:38,367 --> 05:32:46,194
[SPEAKER_61]: I mean, I'll be honest with you, when we look at what was put forward, truthfully, when we actually really look at it, there are a lot of parts in that

4334
05:32:47,694 --> 05:32:52,475
[SPEAKER_61]: which actually were quite negative and quite restrictive for a brewing type of company.

4335
05:32:53,195 --> 05:33:01,377
[SPEAKER_61]: All we're looking for is to say, you look in a dictionary, a brew pub is looked upon as a restaurant that also sells beer made on site.

4336
05:33:02,677 --> 05:33:04,237
[SPEAKER_42]: What does the state law say?

4337
05:33:04,557 --> 05:33:06,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Nick, my question is,

4338
05:33:13,018 --> 05:33:15,140
[SPEAKER_16]: why can't you buy the restaurant that you want?

4339
05:33:15,240 --> 05:33:21,767
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm familiar with the restaurant you want to buy and sell your beer there, but maybe process it off site.

4340
05:33:22,909 --> 05:33:25,592
[SPEAKER_16]: And it will kind of simplify the process for you.

4341
05:33:26,973 --> 05:33:28,335
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you want to brew it there, but

4342
05:33:30,369 --> 05:33:31,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that not work for you?

4343
05:33:32,290 --> 05:33:38,211
[SPEAKER_61]: No, absolutely not, because this is- I'm just trying to think outside for you.

4344
05:33:39,211 --> 05:33:40,051
[SPEAKER_61]: That isn't really.

4345
05:33:40,071 --> 05:33:41,112
[SPEAKER_61]: I mean, I'm sorry.

4346
05:33:41,192 --> 05:33:44,472
[SPEAKER_61]: What is thinking outside the box is to say, let's look in a dictionary.

4347
05:33:44,632 --> 05:33:53,054
[SPEAKER_61]: And right now a brew pub is registered, basically is put in the dictionary as a restaurant that also sells beer made on site.

4348
05:33:53,474 --> 05:33:55,855
[SPEAKER_61]: And that's what we're looking for these things to be recognized as.

4349
05:33:56,235 --> 05:34:13,234
[SPEAKER_61]: that's what we're overall looking for because we want to make beer small batch products that we can help a for the city people want this we've got supporters um who've asked for us to be doing this we're trying to build we're trying to build a business

4350
05:34:13,835 --> 05:34:19,739
[SPEAKER_61]: increase the tax base, put some money into the city, attract more people to this city, and that's what we're trying to do.

4351
05:34:20,560 --> 05:34:22,542
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not opposed to what you're trying to do.

4352
05:34:23,202 --> 05:34:24,903
[SPEAKER_16]: I get what you're trying to do.

4353
05:34:25,003 --> 05:34:33,910
[SPEAKER_16]: I just thought that if you continue to do what I've said, this would just speed up the process a lot easier for you, and you could be up and going a lot quicker.

4354
05:34:35,311 --> 05:34:36,372
[SPEAKER_61]: So you'll be fine with me?

4355
05:34:37,372 --> 05:34:40,535
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm sorry, but I hear in some ways what you're saying.

4356
05:34:42,774 --> 05:34:49,877
[SPEAKER_61]: I cannot open a Medford Brewing Company location where I cannot make my beer on site.

4357
05:34:49,897 --> 05:34:50,957
[SPEAKER_16]: That's okay, that's fine.

4358
05:34:51,197 --> 05:34:55,699
[SPEAKER_61]: I was just trying to, you know, just trying to simplify the process for you.

4359
05:34:55,739 --> 05:34:59,220
[SPEAKER_61]: We want to build a new business in Medford.

4360
05:34:59,320 --> 05:35:00,500
[SPEAKER_61]: We want to help.

4361
05:35:00,820 --> 05:35:07,082
[SPEAKER_61]: We know all the problems with the funding and all these different things with schools, with no money, with all these things.

4362
05:35:07,303 --> 05:35:09,663
[SPEAKER_61]: We want to create jobs in Medford.

4363
05:35:09,683 --> 05:35:11,504
[SPEAKER_40]: Mr. President, this isn't a licensure hearing.

4364
05:35:13,716 --> 05:35:15,138
[SPEAKER_40]: This isn't a hearing on your licensure.

4365
05:35:15,178 --> 05:35:16,800
[SPEAKER_40]: This is a hearing on the ordinance that's before us.

4366
05:35:16,840 --> 05:35:18,622
[SPEAKER_40]: We understand what you're trying to accomplish.

4367
05:35:18,722 --> 05:35:19,383
[SPEAKER_61]: Absolutely, yes.

4368
05:35:19,443 --> 05:35:21,385
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm not asking you about my brewing license.

4369
05:35:21,505 --> 05:35:24,288
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm saying to have an open mind and look and say,

4370
05:35:24,778 --> 05:35:30,341
[SPEAKER_61]: We are looking to open the Medford Brewing Company as a brew pub in the city of Medford.

4371
05:35:30,601 --> 05:35:32,122
[SPEAKER_61]: And that's all we're asking.

4372
05:35:32,242 --> 05:35:33,523
[SPEAKER_61]: And I'm saying that.

4373
05:35:34,344 --> 05:35:36,485
[SPEAKER_61]: There's no more I'm going to say on the matter.

4374
05:35:36,965 --> 05:35:38,266
[SPEAKER_61]: I'll let other people speak.

4375
05:35:38,586 --> 05:35:39,446
[SPEAKER_43]: Can I ask a question?

4376
05:35:40,007 --> 05:35:42,588
[SPEAKER_43]: What in the existing ordinance prevents you from doing that?

4377
05:35:44,009 --> 05:35:44,389
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm sorry?

4378
05:35:44,810 --> 05:35:47,951
[SPEAKER_43]: What in the existing ordinance prevents you from doing that absent an amendment?

4379
05:35:48,812 --> 05:35:54,155
[SPEAKER_61]: We found a location that financially makes sense for our business so it can thrive.

4380
05:35:54,940 --> 05:35:59,984
[SPEAKER_43]: What I'm saying is, what in the existing ordinance prevents you from calling, from opening a brew pub?

4381
05:36:00,784 --> 05:36:04,767
[SPEAKER_43]: I mean, I think that there's three type of brewery license that you can get, right?

4382
05:36:04,827 --> 05:36:08,610
[SPEAKER_43]: A farmer's, a farmer brewer, a pub brewer, a manufacturer brewer, right?

4383
05:36:09,250 --> 05:36:14,254
[SPEAKER_43]: Those are the three types of brewery license that you can receive, and those are all defined by state law.

4384
05:36:15,286 --> 05:36:17,767
[SPEAKER_43]: And a restaurant is also defined by state law, right?

4385
05:36:17,787 --> 05:36:23,229
[SPEAKER_43]: So underneath the existing ordinance, what is it that you're not able to achieve?

4386
05:36:24,390 --> 05:36:28,151
[SPEAKER_43]: What's the district zoned at now that your potential location is in?

4387
05:36:28,231 --> 05:36:31,192
[SPEAKER_43]: Is it non-conforming use or is it something like that?

4388
05:36:31,232 --> 05:36:33,133
[SPEAKER_43]: That's why you're looking for this amendment?

4389
05:36:33,373 --> 05:36:35,634
[SPEAKER_43]: That's what I'm trying to figure out.

4390
05:36:36,724 --> 05:36:43,765
[SPEAKER_61]: So right now, sorry, perhaps Mr. Began, Sean Began should speak, because he's more intelligent than I am.

4391
05:36:44,466 --> 05:36:46,186
[SPEAKER_61]: And he's probably safe.

4392
05:36:46,226 --> 05:36:48,366
[SPEAKER_43]: He's much more intelligent than I am as well, Nick, not you.

4393
05:36:48,806 --> 05:36:49,987
[SPEAKER_43]: He's good.

4394
05:36:50,047 --> 05:36:51,147
[SPEAKER_43]: I know Sean for a number of years.

4395
05:36:51,187 --> 05:36:51,627
[SPEAKER_43]: He's great.

4396
05:36:52,167 --> 05:36:53,988
[SPEAKER_37]: Sean Began, name and address for the record, please.

4397
05:36:54,688 --> 05:36:56,968
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4398
05:36:57,008 --> 05:37:00,649
[SPEAKER_22]: Sean Began, Zero Governors of Medford.

4399
05:37:01,650 --> 05:37:05,013
[SPEAKER_22]: So as many of you know, I'm an attorney.

4400
05:37:07,195 --> 05:37:24,231
[SPEAKER_22]: I've known Nick and I've known Max through our kids for a number of years, but I've just recently kind of been introduced to them and this idea of their brewery after the last city council meeting that took place, I believe back in May or June on this issue.

4401
05:37:25,496 --> 05:37:50,475
[SPEAKER_22]: And what never sat right with me about the existing ordinance that we have here is that it never took into account the type of place that Nick and Max actually want to open, which is in my mind, a restaurant, a place where you can go and get food and get a meal and get a drink.

4402
05:37:51,588 --> 05:37:55,830
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's not a brewery in the purest sense of the word.

4403
05:37:55,910 --> 05:38:10,094
[SPEAKER_22]: It certainly doesn't fit into the first definition of brewery, which would be basically a manufacturing plant where then you're distributing beer out of there to retailers or wholesalers from your brewery.

4404
05:38:10,795 --> 05:38:17,437
[SPEAKER_22]: It really doesn't fit into a tasting room because it's more than a tasting room.

4405
05:38:18,709 --> 05:38:22,912
[SPEAKER_22]: it's a restaurant, you're gonna go there, you're gonna sit down, you're gonna have a full meal.

4406
05:38:23,572 --> 05:38:47,608
[SPEAKER_22]: So a brew pub, what we're trying to do is clarify that a brew pub where there will also be some beer brewed there, but with limitations on the way that they can sell that beer, and the limitation is set forth in the proposed amendment, differentiating it from either a brewery or a tasting room.

4407
05:38:48,664 --> 05:38:59,573
[SPEAKER_22]: And what we're trying to do is get some clarification such that a brew pub will have the rights of a restaurant and not the rights of a brewery.

4408
05:39:00,734 --> 05:39:07,980
[SPEAKER_22]: In this definition of brewery that's before you, it says that the facility may only sell beverages produced by

4409
05:39:09,039 --> 05:39:10,360
[SPEAKER_22]: branded by the brewery.

4410
05:39:10,960 --> 05:39:14,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that's not necessarily true for a restaurant.

4411
05:39:14,963 --> 05:39:23,149
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, they will be brewing beer, but they're gonna have all the other rights that may be co-existent with having a restaurant in the city of Medford.

4412
05:39:24,991 --> 05:39:29,754
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's the reason for the amendment, and that's the need for the clarification.

4413
05:39:30,475 --> 05:39:36,119
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think if we stop getting hung up on this issue of

4414
05:39:37,552 --> 05:39:39,973
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this a brewery like Anheuser-Busch?

4415
05:39:40,353 --> 05:39:40,593
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

4416
05:39:41,053 --> 05:39:50,437
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a restaurant that is going to brew small amounts of beer to primarily be serving to patrons.

4417
05:39:50,837 --> 05:39:54,099
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's how it should be classified as a restaurant in that case.

4418
05:39:54,199 --> 05:40:01,762
[SPEAKER_22]: If someone else wants to come to Medford and create a brewery in its purest sense of the form, then

4419
05:40:02,315 --> 05:40:08,261
[SPEAKER_22]: They can come under this ordinance and apply for a brewery and be subject to those same restrictions.

4420
05:40:09,383 --> 05:40:11,285
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's the point of the amendment.

4421
05:40:11,765 --> 05:40:13,627
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why we need the clarification.

4422
05:40:14,348 --> 05:40:23,498
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's why I thought that it was very fortuitous, actually, that this ordinance had not gone to the Community Development Board.

4423
05:40:24,130 --> 05:40:32,474
[SPEAKER_22]: and that we were able to catch up with it before that happened, such that the Community Development Board will now have this amendment to also consider.

4424
05:40:33,015 --> 05:40:46,422
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's one of the reasons I advised Nick and Max to make this amendment via one of the city counselors in the city of Medford and to propose it and to support it.

4425
05:40:48,003 --> 05:40:49,764
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why we're here.

4426
05:40:50,304 --> 05:40:52,065
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why the clarification is needed.

4427
05:40:53,201 --> 05:41:16,126
[SPEAKER_22]: And I do want to kind of circle back to a point Nick made, which is if these two guys have the guts to open a restaurant during COVID-19 pandemic, when no one in their right mind is opening a restaurant, and bring some potential tax revenue in this town, let's support these guys and get behind them.

4428
05:41:16,686 --> 05:41:18,406
[SPEAKER_22]: They've had a really,

4429
05:41:19,602 --> 05:41:22,803
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's no one's fault because it's just the way government runs.

4430
05:41:23,544 --> 05:41:32,607
[SPEAKER_22]: But they've had a very interesting experience with trying to kind of see how something gets made in the city in terms of legislation.

4431
05:41:32,667 --> 05:41:34,548
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think they've been waiting about two years.

4432
05:41:35,888 --> 05:41:37,589
[SPEAKER_22]: Meanwhile, they've been growing their brand.

4433
05:41:38,029 --> 05:41:44,332
[SPEAKER_22]: They've been bringing in new loyal followers, all of who want to come to their Medford Brewery restaurant.

4434
05:41:45,092 --> 05:41:47,333
[SPEAKER_22]: So let's pass this amendment.

4435
05:41:48,590 --> 05:41:52,952
[SPEAKER_22]: moving on to community development, we'll have to see what they say.

4436
05:41:53,973 --> 05:41:55,053
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we'll take it from there.

4437
05:41:55,213 --> 05:42:06,479
[SPEAKER_22]: But I don't see what the hang up is with this amendment being passed or being added to this ordinance, which still has to be reviewed anyway by community development board.

4438
05:42:06,799 --> 05:42:18,225
[SPEAKER_22]: So I hope I've clarified some of the reasons why we're here and why I think it's a necessary amendment and why I told Nick and Max to pursue it.

4439
05:42:20,370 --> 05:42:21,671
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Knight, then Councilor Beers.

4440
05:42:21,711 --> 05:42:22,251
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Knight.

4441
05:42:22,991 --> 05:42:24,112
[SPEAKER_22]: We should let you go first, Sean.

4442
05:42:27,273 --> 05:42:30,314
[SPEAKER_22]: He's much better than I am.

4443
05:42:30,554 --> 05:42:33,196
[SPEAKER_22]: I had to wait until it was Wednesday when it was my turn.

4444
05:42:33,256 --> 05:42:34,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Now it's Wednesday.

4445
05:42:34,776 --> 05:42:35,076
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all right.

4446
05:42:35,096 --> 05:42:35,777
[SPEAKER_22]: You're overtime.

4447
05:42:37,618 --> 05:42:46,301
[SPEAKER_43]: So ultimately, what we're doing is we're not moving this out of the brewery ordinance.

4448
05:42:46,321 --> 05:42:49,923
[SPEAKER_43]: What we're doing is putting a definition into the brewery ordinance that would allow them

4449
05:42:50,475 --> 05:42:57,516
[SPEAKER_43]: to also sell bottles of vodka that they don't make on site if they get the proper license for it.

4450
05:42:58,537 --> 05:43:07,338
[SPEAKER_43]: Budweiser, Bud Light products if they want to serve those products because those are products that are provided by a distributor and not manufactured on site.

4451
05:43:07,478 --> 05:43:10,399
[SPEAKER_22]: It would have them treated as a restaurant, plain and simple.

4452
05:43:10,699 --> 05:43:16,120
[SPEAKER_22]: Whatever a restaurant can do, a brew pub can do because it's essentially a restaurant.

4453
05:43:18,857 --> 05:43:24,839
[SPEAKER_43]: And then the limitations on the production or the sale is capped at 25%.

4454
05:43:25,219 --> 05:43:26,779
[SPEAKER_43]: Can you clarify that?

4455
05:43:26,939 --> 05:43:37,162
[SPEAKER_22]: The way the amendment is written is in being proposed is it says the brew pub shall sell 25% or more of its beer on site.

4456
05:43:38,163 --> 05:43:42,684
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that is a key difference between a brewery

4457
05:43:44,281 --> 05:43:46,923
[SPEAKER_22]: because we're talking about now distribution, right?

4458
05:43:47,703 --> 05:43:55,648
[SPEAKER_22]: A brewery is distributing beer out of its brewery, 95%, 99% all the time.

4459
05:43:56,328 --> 05:44:02,252
[SPEAKER_22]: A brew pub is not, it's selling most of its beer to its patrons.

4460
05:44:04,508 --> 05:44:08,232
[SPEAKER_43]: Now we'll come down to what state license you obtain, right?

4461
05:44:08,332 --> 05:44:14,858
[SPEAKER_22]: And that would depend on what state license they can obtain and they would need a, I think it's a brew pub license actually.

4462
05:44:14,878 --> 05:44:16,360
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, they know better.

4463
05:44:16,380 --> 05:44:22,005
[SPEAKER_22]: I think, yeah, Nick, Nick knows a little bit better than me as to that specific state license, I think.

4464
05:44:22,506 --> 05:44:25,289
[SPEAKER_22]: But I, there is a specific license for this setup.

4465
05:44:26,055 --> 05:44:26,255
[SPEAKER_61]: Yeah.

4466
05:44:26,315 --> 05:44:42,345
[SPEAKER_61]: So, so we would have to have a, uh, we would apply through the federal for the ABCC and the TTB for a brew pub license and to operate legally in basically in Medford and Massachusetts, we then have to have a full liquor license.

4467
05:44:43,565 --> 05:44:53,151
[SPEAKER_61]: So we'd have to go through the liquor license process, um, versus the pouring license, et cetera, because of the, uh, designation.

4468
05:44:53,866 --> 05:45:04,254
[SPEAKER_43]: And I do understand that in the licensing process, you know, like you said, you have to go through the, at the federal level, the, the ATB, the Alcohol Tobacco Firearms Bureau, and at the state level, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission.

4469
05:45:04,794 --> 05:45:09,618
[SPEAKER_43]: So there is, you know, some levels of bureaucracy, yeah, because you know, the stuff can blow up and everything else.

4470
05:45:09,778 --> 05:45:11,799
[SPEAKER_43]: And you know, I mean, it's, it's not easy to make.

4471
05:45:12,620 --> 05:45:14,601
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, I understand this a little bit better now.

4472
05:45:15,542 --> 05:45:16,803
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, I still would like legal review.

4473
05:45:17,579 --> 05:45:20,400
[SPEAKER_43]: So, you know, this evening I probably will not support it.

4474
05:45:20,780 --> 05:45:25,241
[SPEAKER_43]: However, in the future, once I get my clarifications from council and I feel comfortable, I will.

4475
05:45:25,301 --> 05:45:30,062
[SPEAKER_43]: So thank you very much for allowing me at this late hour to take up more time than we needed to.

4476
05:45:30,262 --> 05:45:30,582
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

4477
05:45:31,543 --> 05:45:32,363
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Councilman.

4478
05:45:32,403 --> 05:45:33,003
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor Behrs?

4479
05:45:33,023 --> 05:45:39,905
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to say thank you to Councilor Morrell for proposing the amendment, and I strongly support it.

4480
05:45:39,945 --> 05:45:44,326
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this is exactly what Medford needs at this moment, and we shouldn't be standing in the way.

4481
05:45:44,686 --> 05:45:45,606
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4482
05:45:46,564 --> 05:45:48,445
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

4483
05:45:48,465 --> 05:45:49,605
[SPEAKER_31]: Councilor Morrell.

4484
05:45:50,505 --> 05:45:51,165
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4485
05:45:51,185 --> 05:45:59,728
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to add briefly, obviously there's been a lot of talk about Medford Brewing, but I know so much, or at least a portion of the back and forth about the brewery ordinance was related to food.

4486
05:45:59,768 --> 05:46:04,089
[SPEAKER_31]: So I think this is also something that really addresses that and establishing that restaurant type.

4487
05:46:04,349 --> 05:46:04,910
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you.

4488
05:46:06,890 --> 05:46:07,790
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

4489
05:46:07,850 --> 05:46:09,151
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions from the council?

4490
05:46:09,895 --> 05:46:11,195
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Carviello.

4491
05:46:11,575 --> 05:46:12,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4492
05:46:12,756 --> 05:46:15,497
[SPEAKER_16]: I, for one, I'm happy that they're going to be serving food in there.

4493
05:46:16,097 --> 05:46:17,537
[SPEAKER_16]: That address is a big concern of mine.

4494
05:46:17,557 --> 05:46:23,819
[SPEAKER_16]: So, again, I applaud them for listening and adding food to their menu, to their repertoire.

4495
05:46:24,799 --> 05:46:26,420
[SPEAKER_16]: And I support what they're doing.

4496
05:46:28,120 --> 05:46:28,560
[SPEAKER_50]: Mr. President.

4497
05:46:29,640 --> 05:46:30,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Carlos Capelli.

4498
05:46:32,061 --> 05:46:32,941
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4499
05:46:33,261 --> 05:46:38,983
[SPEAKER_50]: I, too, I know Nick and I were going back and forth, and I had great conversations with Mr. Moki.

4500
05:46:40,084 --> 05:46:51,627
[SPEAKER_49]: The clarification, especially this evening, I think that it is time to move forward and pass this on to the next step so we can get this process to fruition.

4501
05:46:51,747 --> 05:46:56,868
[SPEAKER_49]: So it's something I know that the Mifflin Brewing Company has been waiting for.

4502
05:46:56,948 --> 05:47:07,770
[SPEAKER_51]: And I think that the truth of the matter is it is time and it would seem to be prohibited if we didn't try to find our ways to make sure that

4503
05:47:08,944 --> 05:47:14,365
[SPEAKER_51]: we take care of the organizations that stuck with us through thick and thin.

4504
05:47:14,425 --> 05:47:24,468
[SPEAKER_51]: So, you know, I wish them the best of luck as we keep moving forward with the light stabilizers that they need, but I'm willing to move forward with this this evening.

4505
05:47:24,508 --> 05:47:25,068
[SPEAKER_51]: So thank you.

4506
05:47:26,108 --> 05:47:27,308
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

4507
05:47:27,689 --> 05:47:28,909
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other questions from the council?

4508
05:47:30,309 --> 05:47:31,629
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, let's see.

4509
05:47:31,709 --> 05:47:34,030
[SPEAKER_37]: We have a comment from Derek Anderson.

4510
05:47:34,070 --> 05:47:35,830
[SPEAKER_37]: He's got his hand up.

4511
05:47:36,271 --> 05:47:37,951
[SPEAKER_37]: Derek, name and address for the record, please.

4512
05:47:40,591 --> 05:47:43,032
[SPEAKER_54]: 16 Myrtle Street, Medford, Derek Anderson.

4513
05:47:43,632 --> 05:47:46,572
[SPEAKER_54]: I just wanna say I support this amendment.

4514
05:47:46,592 --> 05:47:59,295
[SPEAKER_54]: It's been a long time coming and I highly encourage city council to move this through as quickly as possible and not delay any longer, particularly in a pandemic where we have a small business owner trying to get something started here.

4515
05:47:59,315 --> 05:48:01,316
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, thank you.

4516
05:48:02,256 --> 05:48:04,797
[SPEAKER_37]: We have a number of other people that would like to speak.

4517
05:48:05,077 --> 05:48:06,637
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, Benjamin Johnson.

4518
05:48:09,965 --> 05:48:20,523
[SPEAKER_64]: I live around the corner from this place and I've seen what Goldilocks has done to the neighborhood and it's been awesome and if we have a small local

4519
05:48:21,564 --> 05:48:26,468
[SPEAKER_64]: bistro restaurant that serves local beer, that is phenomenal.

4520
05:48:26,568 --> 05:48:31,733
[SPEAKER_64]: That would bring so much to this sort of area here.

4521
05:48:32,213 --> 05:48:35,336
[SPEAKER_64]: I also met Max about four years ago.

4522
05:48:35,356 --> 05:48:40,300
[SPEAKER_64]: I grow hops, I'm a home brewer as well, and I gave Max a bunch of my hops

4523
05:48:40,820 --> 05:48:46,545
[SPEAKER_64]: And at one point when I was, when he was at my house, he mentioned that he was going to start a brick and mortar place.

4524
05:48:46,625 --> 05:48:51,389
[SPEAKER_64]: And I was like, well, you know, that's, that's a long time off, you know, you're, you're just starting out.

4525
05:48:51,790 --> 05:49:05,041
[SPEAKER_64]: And he said, you know, he would love to have, uh, like a local cask small, which is like a five gallon, um, uh, beer, uh, that, that he would brew that would have local hops.

4526
05:49:05,382 --> 05:49:07,784
[SPEAKER_64]: And if my hops could supply that.

4527
05:49:09,798 --> 05:49:11,620
[SPEAKER_64]: I'm way, way into that.

4528
05:49:11,680 --> 05:49:12,520
[SPEAKER_64]: That's so cool.

4529
05:49:12,600 --> 05:49:20,846
[SPEAKER_64]: So, you know, bringing a little local to the area, you know, this location right around the corner is not that far.

4530
05:49:21,086 --> 05:49:31,072
[SPEAKER_64]: It's a stone's throw away from where ships were built in Medford, and Medford Brewing Company has that ship right on their masthead.

4531
05:49:31,112 --> 05:49:32,693
[SPEAKER_64]: So, hey, I'm all for it.

4532
05:49:33,174 --> 05:49:33,374
[SPEAKER_37]: Great.

4533
05:49:33,654 --> 05:49:34,234
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Benjamin.

4534
05:49:35,395 --> 05:49:37,857
[SPEAKER_37]: Jim Crott, name and address for the record, please.

4535
05:49:40,373 --> 05:49:41,514
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi there, my name is Jim Crott.

4536
05:49:42,034 --> 05:49:44,955
[SPEAKER_30]: I live on Winter Street, number 22.

4537
05:49:47,076 --> 05:49:52,078
[SPEAKER_30]: Winter Street is actually the cross street of where Nick wants to open up this place.

4538
05:49:52,158 --> 05:49:54,519
[SPEAKER_30]: It's the old Morton's restaurant.

4539
05:49:55,299 --> 05:49:56,600
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm very familiar with it.

4540
05:49:56,760 --> 05:50:02,242
[SPEAKER_30]: I actually meet Ben in the morning at the bus stop when we drop our kids to the bus.

4541
05:50:02,302 --> 05:50:06,044
[SPEAKER_30]: So we're very familiar with that spot and the whole neighborhood.

4542
05:50:06,750 --> 05:50:15,213
[SPEAKER_30]: So I just want to echo what Ben said in that the neighborhood is really craving for something like this.

4543
05:50:16,053 --> 05:50:28,057
[SPEAKER_30]: And as Ben's also said, Goldilocks is really leading the way there and showing that the neighborhood really wants some new businesses to come in and that they would support it.

4544
05:50:28,157 --> 05:50:29,318
[SPEAKER_30]: I would definitely support it.

4545
05:50:29,338 --> 05:50:35,540
[SPEAKER_30]: I know a lot of people on my street would support this kind of endeavor.

4546
05:50:36,172 --> 05:50:40,873
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think it's great, it's run by two locals, they wanna invest in the community.

4547
05:50:40,893 --> 05:50:48,635
[SPEAKER_30]: I think it's gonna be otherwise, I don't know when the next person will be to come along to buy that building, but I fear that it's gonna be there for a long time.

4548
05:50:49,455 --> 05:50:59,757
[SPEAKER_30]: So I would just urge you guys to give these guys a helping hand and let them move along and invest in Medford and do something positive.

4549
05:50:59,777 --> 05:51:05,338
[SPEAKER_30]: Because I think the residents of this neighborhood, Medford Hillside neighborhood would really appreciate

4550
05:51:06,233 --> 05:51:10,454
[SPEAKER_30]: something new and positive coming like their little group up.

4551
05:51:10,494 --> 05:51:11,795
[SPEAKER_30]: So thank you for your time.

4552
05:51:12,795 --> 05:51:13,075
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

4553
05:51:13,095 --> 05:51:16,816
[SPEAKER_35]: We have, let's see, Carolyn Morrison.

4554
05:51:20,197 --> 05:51:20,998
[SPEAKER_35]: We're trying to unmute.

4555
05:51:21,078 --> 05:51:22,498
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, name and address for the record, please.

4556
05:51:23,778 --> 05:51:25,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Carolyn Morrison, 26 West Street.

4557
05:51:26,679 --> 05:51:30,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to echo what Ben and Jim just said.

4558
05:51:31,001 --> 05:51:32,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Being on West Street, I'm

4559
05:51:32,717 --> 05:51:37,941
[SPEAKER_07]: also right around the corner from Goldilocks and the proposed location.

4560
05:51:37,981 --> 05:51:40,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it would be a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.

4561
05:51:40,503 --> 05:51:43,246
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that we can push this through.

4562
05:51:44,527 --> 05:51:44,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

4563
05:51:45,387 --> 05:51:45,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

4564
05:51:49,370 --> 05:51:50,411
[SPEAKER_36]: Any other comments from the council?

4565
05:51:53,254 --> 05:51:54,274
[SPEAKER_37]: OK, the chair awaits a motion.

4566
05:51:55,676 --> 05:51:57,497
[SPEAKER_29]: Motion to approve as amended, Mr. President.

4567
05:51:58,069 --> 05:52:04,351
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Council appears to approve as amended by Councilor Morrell, seconded by... Second.

4568
05:52:05,551 --> 05:52:08,832
[SPEAKER_41]: Motion to sever.

4569
05:52:08,852 --> 05:52:12,513
[SPEAKER_37]: There's a motion to sever the... Amendment from the main motion.

4570
05:52:14,734 --> 05:52:16,214
[SPEAKER_37]: To sever the amendment for the main motion?

4571
05:52:16,614 --> 05:52:17,015
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, sir.

4572
05:52:17,935 --> 05:52:24,277
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so there's a motion to sever these on that motion, seconded by...

4573
05:52:28,712 --> 05:52:30,172
[SPEAKER_37]: There's a motion to sever, I have a second.

4574
05:52:31,333 --> 05:52:31,693
[SPEAKER_49]: Second.

4575
05:52:32,533 --> 05:52:33,973
[SPEAKER_37]: Second by Councilor Scott Kelly.

[SPEAKER_37]: 20-472 Memorandum to President John Falco and members of the Memphis City Council.

4661
05:55:08,286 --> 05:55:15,474
[SPEAKER_37]: CC registrar vote is from Adam Herterby, City Clerk, regarding Ward 3, Precinct 1 polling location, July 23, 2020.

4662
05:55:17,356 --> 05:55:23,140
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a follow-up paper to 20-472 from last month, as I reported in June.

4663
05:55:23,601 --> 05:55:33,448
[SPEAKER_37]: The former Lawrence Memorial Hospital site will not be available as a polling location for the September-November elections because of the ongoing construction and because of COVID-19 concerns.

4664
05:55:34,168 --> 05:55:45,052
[SPEAKER_37]: When I became aware that the LMH campus would not be available as a polling location, I began working identifying a new potential polling location for Ward 3, Precinct 1.

4665
05:55:45,572 --> 05:55:52,275
[SPEAKER_37]: I sought guidance from the Election Division of the Office of Secretary of the Commonwealth on designation of a new polling place.

4666
05:55:52,615 --> 05:55:56,817
[SPEAKER_37]: I reached out to the Commander Richard Martin of the American Legion post at 321 Winthrop Street.

4667
05:55:58,556 --> 05:56:05,201
[SPEAKER_37]: Commander Martin graciously volunteered the Legion Post as a polling place for both- Mr. President, move for the Reader's Digest version.

4668
05:56:07,062 --> 05:56:11,044
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to get a brief synopsis from our City Clerk.

4669
05:56:13,086 --> 05:56:15,708
[SPEAKER_37]: City Clerk, could you please give us a brief synopsis of the paper?

4670
05:56:16,848 --> 05:56:18,589
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, thank you.

4671
05:56:20,451 --> 05:56:23,613
[SPEAKER_57]: As I mentioned at the last meeting in June,

4672
05:56:25,080 --> 05:56:30,422
[SPEAKER_57]: We have lost the Lawrence Memorial Hospital as a polling place because of construction, because of COVID concerns.

4673
05:56:31,462 --> 05:56:37,425
[SPEAKER_57]: Because of the late date, it put us a little bit behind the eight ball in terms of finding a polling place.

4674
05:56:38,745 --> 05:56:42,146
[SPEAKER_57]: Commander Richard Martin from the American Legion post 45 on Winthrop Street.

4675
05:56:45,078 --> 05:56:49,300
[SPEAKER_57]: volunteered his location as a polling place for 3-1.

4676
05:56:49,320 --> 05:56:55,764
[SPEAKER_57]: Neil Osborne and I, along with two members of the Commission on Disabilities, visited on July 1st.

4677
05:56:56,144 --> 05:56:58,125
[SPEAKER_57]: We found it more than adequate as a polling place.

4678
05:56:58,645 --> 05:57:00,606
[SPEAKER_57]: It has ample parking in back.

4679
05:57:00,846 --> 05:57:02,587
[SPEAKER_57]: It has handicapped parking spaces.

4680
05:57:03,067 --> 05:57:07,810
[SPEAKER_57]: We can also add, it has, I think, four marked handicapped spaces along the side.

4681
05:57:08,590 --> 05:57:09,992
[SPEAKER_57]: It has ample parking in back.

4682
05:57:10,032 --> 05:57:13,136
[SPEAKER_57]: We can also put some temporary handicapped spots in front.

4683
05:57:14,037 --> 05:57:19,243
[SPEAKER_57]: It meets all access requirements for wheelchairs and wheeled mobility devices.

4684
05:57:20,685 --> 05:57:25,130
[SPEAKER_57]: And the four of us unanimously concluded that it would be an excellent polling place.

4685
05:57:25,771 --> 05:57:49,627
[SPEAKER_57]: So because of the timelines we're up against with a 20-day notification period before the election, I'm asking you to designate the American Legion post on Winthrop Street as the temporary polling place for Ward 3-1 for the September and November elections so that I can get the two reverse 911 calls out and the postcard out all within the 20-day deadline before the September 1st election.

4686
05:57:50,347 --> 05:57:51,248
[SPEAKER_42]: So moved, Mr. President.

4687
05:57:52,208 --> 05:57:57,993
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs, Clerk Urnaby, please call the roll.

4688
05:57:58,873 --> 05:58:03,297
[SPEAKER_36]: Actually, if I may, are there any questions from the public or concerns?

4689
05:58:03,317 --> 05:58:07,460
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, seeing and hearing none, Clerk Urnaby, please call the roll.

4690

[SPEAKER_57]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

4709
05:58:31,519 --> 05:58:44,426
[SPEAKER_37]: If I may, we do have Jackie Peeks on the line from the mayor's office who is available to talk about, let's see, it was 20-496, the food trucks.

4710
05:58:45,727 --> 05:58:48,328
[SPEAKER_37]: So can we take that from the table and we'll speak on that one?

4711
05:58:48,408 --> 05:58:49,428
[SPEAKER_37]: Is that okay with everyone?

4712
05:58:49,829 --> 05:58:50,289
[SPEAKER_37]: That's fine.

4713
05:58:50,839 --> 05:58:53,781

05:58:55,522 --> 05:58:56,983
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm just, I'm just getting going counselor now.

4716
05:58:57,003 --> 05:58:58,844
[SPEAKER_37]: This is ridiculous.

4717
05:58:58,864 --> 05:58:59,084
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

4718
05:58:59,124 --> 05:59:02,607
[SPEAKER_57]: On the motion to take this from the table, someone make a motion to take this from the table.

4719
05:59:02,627 --> 05:59:03,467

[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

4732
05:59:35,877 --> 05:59:36,158
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

4733
05:59:36,638 --> 05:59:37,339
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco?

4734
05:59:38,083 --> 05:59:42,045
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, the motion has been taken from the table.

4735
05:59:43,206 --> 05:59:48,208
[SPEAKER_37]: We read earlier that this is a request from the mayor's office.

4736
05:59:48,689 --> 05:59:56,893
[SPEAKER_37]: She respectfully requests that we approve the following list of food trucks for events that are scheduled for the coming months due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the city.

4737
05:59:56,933 --> 06:00:03,317
[SPEAKER_43]: Motion to waive the reading, Mr. President, and allow a representative from the administration please provide us with a brief synopsis, including the dates, times, and locations.

4738
06:00:03,957 --> 06:00:07,379
[SPEAKER_37]: Jackie, can you please give us dates, time, and locations and a brief synopsis?

4739
06:00:08,906 --> 06:00:10,087
[SPEAKER_45]: Can you hear me okay?

4740
06:00:11,028 --> 06:00:11,808
[SPEAKER_45]: Yeah.

4741
06:00:12,029 --> 06:00:13,850
[SPEAKER_45]: Okay, great, great.

4742
06:00:13,970 --> 06:00:20,056
[SPEAKER_45]: I can give you a brief announcement first, which will lead into the dates and times.

4743
06:00:21,238 --> 06:00:25,742
[SPEAKER_45]: So the Streets Program came out of a program called Food Truck Festivals of America.

4744
06:00:25,822 --> 06:00:29,546
[SPEAKER_45]: The applicant herself, she was on the call earlier and had to leave, so she apologized.

4745
06:00:30,376 --> 06:00:37,078
[SPEAKER_45]: They had initially been working towards a full festival much earlier in the year, obviously, and had done a lot of work around that.

4746
06:00:37,158 --> 06:00:41,139
[SPEAKER_45]: And then, obviously, when the pandemic hit, they completely switched their model.

4747
06:00:41,239 --> 06:00:49,001
[SPEAKER_45]: So what they've been doing in other communities around Bedford already is there's a program by resident request only.

4748
06:00:49,401 --> 06:00:54,462
[SPEAKER_45]: They would provide a food truck, one as was described in the,

4749
06:00:55,575 --> 06:01:04,179
[SPEAKER_45]: the agenda item before you, that would be either a lunch or a dinner truck, a meal truck, and then a potential secondary for like an ice cream, so a dessert truck.

4750
06:01:05,339 --> 06:01:08,921
[SPEAKER_45]: They would pull up into the neighborhood all by pre-order.

4751
06:01:08,961 --> 06:01:16,965
[SPEAKER_45]: So residents would essentially be assigned a specific time, no more than six people per 15 minute time slot to pick up their food.

4752
06:01:17,265 --> 06:01:22,147
[SPEAKER_45]: And then it would be a three to four hour time window that the truck would be in the neighborhood and then they would leave.

4753
06:01:22,748 --> 06:01:24,809
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, so it's not a typical event.

4754
06:01:24,930 --> 06:01:29,453
[SPEAKER_45]: It's just the process that we, we have, um, in place, which is why it says event on the form.

4755
06:01:29,513 --> 06:01:34,896
[SPEAKER_45]: So just want to clarify that this is not a true event due to the situation that we're currently in with the pandemic.

4756
06:01:35,577 --> 06:01:39,259
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, so they, they don't currently have resident requests before them.

4757
06:01:39,359 --> 06:01:41,521
[SPEAKER_45]: So they are asking for consideration.

4758
06:01:42,081 --> 06:01:50,907
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, if the council would be willing to do so to between the months of August and October to allow them to do, they had requested between five and eight total.

4759
06:01:51,554 --> 06:01:56,256
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, the mayor, um, issued approval for up to five within that timeframe.

4760
06:01:56,897 --> 06:02:03,140
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, and I do have the application that they submitted with significant information, um, that I can provide to you if you do not already have it.

4761
06:02:03,720 --> 06:02:05,861
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, and I can answer any questions that you may have.

4762
06:02:07,422 --> 06:02:11,804
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's just kind of like people, but it doesn't go to your door.

4763
06:02:11,824 --> 06:02:13,105
[SPEAKER_40]: You got to run up to the car and pick it up.

4764
06:02:14,485 --> 06:02:27,575
[SPEAKER_45]: So if a resident, for example, would, um, request or talk to the neighbors that they would want to have this program on their street for a certain date and time, um, they would notify their neighbors and then preorder online for us, whatever the truck is for that.

4765
06:02:28,076 --> 06:02:28,856
[SPEAKER_45]: Specific day.

4766
06:02:29,457 --> 06:02:42,627
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, so essentially, yeah, something like a peapod, but with, you know, meals that you would typically, you know, walk up to like, you know, in a, um, in downtown Boston, for example, and just order there that won't be allowed, you'll have to preorder.

4767
06:02:43,160 --> 06:02:48,141
[SPEAKER_45]: just so they can adhere to social distancing guidelines and make sure that people aren't assembling in one spot.

4768
06:02:48,881 --> 06:02:55,223
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's pretty much, it's like Grubhub that cooks it in the car on the way to your house?

4769
06:02:55,403 --> 06:02:57,884
[SPEAKER_45]: Sure, that's the way to describe it, yeah.

4770
06:02:57,964 --> 06:03:04,565
[SPEAKER_45]: I think that's, again, this is based on what her application is, so I'm just doing my best to answer on behalf of the applicant.

4771
06:03:04,865 --> 06:03:06,266
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay, I get it.

4772
06:03:07,486 --> 06:03:10,947
[SPEAKER_43]: And, you know, so say that the truck is coming to a neighborhood,

4773
06:03:12,283 --> 06:03:13,964
[SPEAKER_43]: Does the truck stop and stay there though?

4774
06:03:14,004 --> 06:03:18,707
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, I mean, is the truck blocking the street, but you know, do they need street closure permits or anything like that?

4775
06:03:18,747 --> 06:03:21,669
[SPEAKER_43]: Is it like a block potty type of deal or like a picnic or something?

4776
06:03:21,709 --> 06:03:24,771
[SPEAKER_43]: Or is it more like the thing pulls on the sidewalk and you go up to the ice cream truck?

4777
06:03:25,731 --> 06:03:27,633
[SPEAKER_45]: No, it'd be more pre-permanent through us.

4778
06:03:27,653 --> 06:03:36,198
[SPEAKER_45]: So when they receive a resident request for a particular street, they would be required to contact us and go through all of the normal health department requirements.

4779
06:03:36,218 --> 06:03:41,541
[SPEAKER_45]: We'd make sure that they have, you know, the parking spots and everything is done appropriately.

4780
06:03:42,253 --> 06:03:56,403
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, and with, you know, whatever their typical notification is, they did say in their application process that they typically do notification through things like next door and, and Facebook, but they also, um, we'll work with the neighbors on that particular street to make sure that they again.

4781
06:03:57,023 --> 06:04:06,430
[SPEAKER_45]: Are aware in advance that this is happening, but we would make sure that it's done, um, safely responsibly and with all of the, um, city and health permits in place in advance.

4782
06:04:10,939 --> 06:04:16,205
[SPEAKER_45]: Because their model is currently by resident request, they don't have a request before them currently.

4783
06:04:16,245 --> 06:04:24,593
[SPEAKER_45]: They had one a few weeks ago and had to put it off because we wanted to make sure that we had all the proper requests in and that this was something that the council would be comfortable with.

4784
06:04:25,394 --> 06:04:33,082
[SPEAKER_45]: So when they do get any requests between August and October, if this were to be approved, they would come back and let us know and we would work with them to make sure that

4785
06:04:34,663 --> 06:04:38,266
[SPEAKER_45]: but certainly that they're spread out within that four months timeframe, three months timeframe.

4786
06:04:38,666 --> 06:04:43,050
[SPEAKER_43]: And they'd only be able to come five times to the city and that's it based upon what this is saying?

4787
06:04:43,210 --> 06:04:44,891
[SPEAKER_45]: Yes, yes, they've been made aware.

4788
06:04:45,512 --> 06:04:47,793
[SPEAKER_43]: All right, so this is almost like a trial program to see if this works?

4789
06:04:49,375 --> 06:04:54,358
[SPEAKER_45]: Correct, and I think, again, this is an assumption on my part, but their model is typically based around festivals.

4790
06:04:54,398 --> 06:05:01,524
[SPEAKER_45]: So I think this is just a modification while we're in the pandemic and then if and when they were allowed to do that, they would make a different request.

4791
06:05:02,168 --> 06:05:05,989
[SPEAKER_45]: So this is purely up to five events between August and October of this year.

4792
06:05:06,609 --> 06:05:07,610
[SPEAKER_42]: Move forward, Mr. President.

4793
06:05:08,690 --> 06:05:14,412
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion to cancel tonight, seconded by- Seconded by Vice President Caviello.

4794
06:05:14,472 --> 06:05:15,472
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Caviello.

4795
06:05:16,012 --> 06:05:16,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

4796
06:05:17,393 --> 06:05:23,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Jackie, does this company have their own food trucks or do they sub out to other companies?

4797
06:05:25,670 --> 06:05:29,411
[SPEAKER_45]: They do not own the food trucks, but they have relationships with a number of food trucks.

4798
06:05:29,451 --> 06:05:39,673
[SPEAKER_45]: So the food trucks themselves would be filling out the health permit, but the Food Truck Festivals of America and the Streets Program is the one who's overseeing the program itself.

4799
06:05:40,113 --> 06:05:46,394
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I wanted to do this in my neighborhood, would I get a list of the truck that I get to pick?

4800
06:05:48,315 --> 06:05:49,175
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually not 100% sure on that.

4801
06:05:51,416 --> 06:05:54,937
[SPEAKER_45]: I think that there are a few that they work with, but I can double check.

4802
06:05:55,517 --> 06:06:01,259
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I wanted to have one in my neighborhood, would they give me a list of, you can pick from these four or five trucks?

4803
06:06:02,439 --> 06:06:04,940
[SPEAKER_45]: I believe so, but I'm not 100% sure.

4804
06:06:04,960 --> 06:06:06,080
[SPEAKER_45]: I believe that's how it works.

4805
06:06:06,380 --> 06:06:07,961
[SPEAKER_16]: And how much notice do they need to do this?

4806
06:06:10,081 --> 06:06:19,044
[SPEAKER_45]: Again, I think, to notify us or... Well, if we wanted to do one, say, for September, I mean, how soon in advance do they need to know?

4807
06:06:20,856 --> 06:06:25,379
[SPEAKER_45]: I think if a resident makes the request, they would just ask of us sort of what our timeline is.

4808
06:06:25,459 --> 06:06:28,201
[SPEAKER_45]: So they would be kind of beholden to whatever our processes are.

4809
06:06:28,661 --> 06:06:43,371
[SPEAKER_45]: The health department was heavily consulted before we even entertained this application and are comfortable with the parameters that they've laid out for social distancing and COVID requirements and are prepared to inspect every food truck as soon as they pull up.

4810
06:06:43,991 --> 06:06:45,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you send us a list of the,

4811
06:06:48,564 --> 06:06:49,785
[SPEAKER_16]: the options that we have.

4812
06:06:51,046 --> 06:06:53,888
[SPEAKER_16]: So if people ask us, I'll contact information.

4813
06:06:55,229 --> 06:06:55,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I can.

4814
06:06:55,789 --> 06:06:59,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that'd be great.

4815
06:06:59,412 --> 06:06:59,792
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be great.

4816
06:06:59,832 --> 06:07:00,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

4817
06:07:02,153 --> 06:07:06,537
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Carviello, any other questions from the council?

4818
06:07:08,498 --> 06:07:09,459
[SPEAKER_37]: Any questions from the public?

4819
06:07:11,080 --> 06:07:16,063
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, hearing and seeing none, on the motion of council night, seconded by, I believe it was Vice President Carviello.

4820
06:07:16,103 --> 06:07:17,224

[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco?

4834
06:07:38,244 --> 06:07:38,484
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

4835
06:07:39,025 --> 06:07:41,487
[SPEAKER_37]: Sending the affirmative, adjourning the negative, the motion passes.

4836
06:07:42,087 --> 06:07:47,792
[SPEAKER_41]: Mr. President, can we take National Grid rental locations, please?

4837
06:07:47,852 --> 06:07:49,954
[SPEAKER_41]: Because after that, I'm going to be excusing myself.

4838
06:07:50,629 --> 06:07:55,990
[SPEAKER_51]: Yes, so... Mr. President, I guess we've lost the feed too, I'm told.

4839
06:07:57,731 --> 06:07:59,551
[SPEAKER_36]: Lost the what?

4840
06:07:59,611 --> 06:08:02,112
[SPEAKER_51]: The feed for the television.

4841
06:08:02,672 --> 06:08:03,613
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh, it's gone too long?

4842
06:08:03,633 --> 06:08:07,894
[SPEAKER_51]: I guess the quarters ran out.

4843
06:08:10,054 --> 06:08:12,215
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, well... We didn't pay the bill.

4844
06:08:14,955 --> 06:08:19,799
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Capiello to revert to the regular order of business.

4845
06:08:20,359 --> 06:08:21,600
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Herves, please call the roll.

4846
06:08:21,921 --> 06:08:25,323
[SPEAKER_43]: The motion was to take the National Grid permits, Mr. President, to grant the location.

4847
06:08:27,105 --> 06:08:27,365
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, OK.

4848
06:08:27,385 --> 06:08:27,885
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm sorry.

4849
06:08:27,905 --> 06:08:29,326
[SPEAKER_37]: So we're going to take those from the table.

4850

[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, to take the National Grid permits from the table, seconded by?

06:08:58,452 --> 06:09:01,413
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, this would be 20-479 and 20-480, if I'm correct.

4870
06:09:01,453 --> 06:09:02,514
[SPEAKER_37]: I believe that's correct, yes.

4871
06:09:07,419 --> 06:09:09,680
[SPEAKER_37]: We do have John Jankowski on the line.

4872
06:09:09,740 --> 06:09:14,361
[SPEAKER_37]: So let's see, did we open up the public?

4873
06:09:14,401 --> 06:09:16,001
[SPEAKER_37]: We did open the public hearing on this one, right?

4874
06:09:16,021 --> 06:09:16,501
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, we did.

4875
06:09:16,701 --> 06:09:17,782
[SPEAKER_37]: On the first one you did, yes.

4876
06:09:18,262 --> 06:09:21,962
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so with that being said, declare the public hearing open.

4877
06:09:22,022 --> 06:09:23,843
[SPEAKER_37]: Open to those in favor of the petition.

4878
06:09:23,863 --> 06:09:30,324
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's see, John Jankowski, could you please give us- Hi, good morning.

4879
06:09:30,845 --> 06:09:33,505
[SPEAKER_48]: John Jankowski, 170 Method Street in Malden, Mass.

4880
06:09:34,766 --> 06:09:36,806
[SPEAKER_48]: I am in favor of this petition.

4881
06:09:37,904 --> 06:09:40,706
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, anyone else in favor of the petition that would like to speak?

4882
06:09:43,288 --> 06:09:46,490
[SPEAKER_37]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

4883
06:09:47,290 --> 06:09:49,512
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone in opposition of the petition?

4884
06:09:50,413 --> 06:09:51,353
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone in opposition?

4885
06:09:53,915 --> 06:09:57,457
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

4886
06:09:57,477 --> 06:10:02,041
[SPEAKER_37]: Are there any questions from the councilors?

4887
06:10:03,702 --> 06:10:04,702
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. President, were you on the

4888
06:10:06,092 --> 06:10:07,793
[SPEAKER_44]: the National Grid one?

4889
06:10:08,213 --> 06:10:08,754
[SPEAKER_44]: You are correct.

4890
06:10:08,834 --> 06:10:10,554
[SPEAKER_44]: This is 20-479.

4891
06:10:11,875 --> 06:10:12,376
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

4892
06:10:12,396 --> 06:10:13,156
[SPEAKER_44]: I do have a question.

4893
06:10:13,456 --> 06:10:14,317
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, absolutely.

4894
06:10:16,138 --> 06:10:21,160
[SPEAKER_44]: Regarding the Eversource, how much of your project is related to the Eversource project?

4895
06:10:21,821 --> 06:10:29,425
[SPEAKER_44]: And if so, what is being done that both of you are working on?

4896
06:10:30,464 --> 06:10:36,406
[SPEAKER_48]: We are just relocating a pole about, I don't know, maybe 10 feet.

4897
06:10:37,086 --> 06:10:43,908
[SPEAKER_48]: And we are relocating a secondary siphon service to a pumping station.

4898
06:10:45,129 --> 06:10:47,029
[SPEAKER_48]: So National Grid will do all that work.

4899
06:10:48,370 --> 06:10:48,590
[SPEAKER_44]: Right.

4900
06:10:48,630 --> 06:10:53,691
[SPEAKER_44]: So when you talk about underground laterals, cables, and wires, is that happening?

4901
06:10:53,711 --> 06:10:53,931
[SPEAKER_48]: Yes.

4902
06:10:54,491 --> 06:10:57,272
[SPEAKER_48]: It's just a secondary siphon service going to a pumping station.

4903
06:10:57,312 --> 06:10:59,513
[SPEAKER_48]: That's why we have to move away from

4904
06:11:00,069 --> 06:11:03,630
[SPEAKER_48]: Eversource's work, so that their work will be clear.

4905
06:11:04,930 --> 06:11:08,831
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, so this is not going to be, is it going to be coordinated with Eversource?

4906
06:11:08,871 --> 06:11:10,511
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, of course, of course.

4907
06:11:10,891 --> 06:11:11,531
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, of course.

4908
06:11:12,732 --> 06:11:13,112
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

4909
06:11:13,372 --> 06:11:13,592
[SPEAKER_48]: Yes.

4910
06:11:15,152 --> 06:11:17,013
[SPEAKER_44]: What's the expected time this will take?

4911
06:11:18,473 --> 06:11:28,515
[SPEAKER_48]: Oh, I would think probably just a day, really, a day and a half, two days, because, you know, the civil is going to do the civil, the underground work and the, um,

4912
06:11:29,028 --> 06:11:32,010
[SPEAKER_48]: The overhead work, it's just going to be an overhead pool to it.

4913
06:11:32,030 --> 06:11:34,652
[SPEAKER_48]: So the overhead work will be just one day.

4914
06:11:34,672 --> 06:11:38,434
[SPEAKER_44]: That's all the questions I have, Mr. President.

4915
06:11:39,034 --> 06:11:39,875
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

4916
06:11:39,975 --> 06:11:41,116
[SPEAKER_36]: Any other questions from the Council?

4917
06:11:41,136 --> 06:11:45,138
[SPEAKER_37]: OK, is there a motion on the floor?

4918
06:11:47,139 --> 06:11:48,260
[SPEAKER_41]: Motion for approval of the paper.

4919
06:11:48,821 --> 06:11:50,942
[SPEAKER_37]: I motion Councilor Layton to approve, seconded by?

4920
06:11:51,522 --> 06:11:51,802
[SPEAKER_37]: Second.

4921
06:11:53,263 --> 06:11:54,804
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by, was that Councilor Scarpelli?

4922
06:11:55,605 --> 06:11:55,905
[SPEAKER_37]: Second.

4923
06:11:58,544 --> 06:11:59,064
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks.

4924
06:12:00,746 --> 06:12:02,267
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks seconding.

4925
06:12:02,507 --> 06:12:03,648
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm sorry, Councilor Marks.

4926
06:12:04,909 --> 06:12:07,290
[SPEAKER_57]: Clerk, please call the roll.

4927
06:12:07,410 --> 06:12:08,651
[SPEAKER_57]: It's getting late or early.

4928
06:12:09,612 --> 06:12:10,252
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs.

4929
06:12:11,974 --> 06:12:12,254
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

4930
06:12:12,814 --> 06:12:13,775
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Caravaglia.

4931
06:12:14,275 --> 06:12:14,576
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

4932
06:12:14,996 --> 06:12:15,496
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight.

4933
06:12:16,177 --> 06:12:16,437
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes.

4934
06:12:16,877 --> 06:12:17,438
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Marks.

4935
06:12:17,978 --> 06:12:18,298
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

4936
06:12:18,658 --> 06:12:19,279
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell.

4937
06:12:19,899 --> 06:12:20,180
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

4938
06:12:20,580 --> 06:12:21,380
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli.

4939
06:12:22,301 --> 06:12:22,561
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes.

4940
06:12:23,242 --> 06:12:24,042
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco.

4941
06:12:24,783 --> 06:12:27,485
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, affirmative, zero, the negative, the motion passes.

4942
06:12:29,704 --> 06:12:31,984
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, Mr. President.

4943
06:12:32,004 --> 06:12:32,445
[SPEAKER_50]: Mr. President.

4944
06:12:33,145 --> 06:12:33,985
[SPEAKER_50]: Counselor Scott Pelley.

4945
06:12:34,845 --> 06:12:41,827
[SPEAKER_50]: So you're aware, I'm in the red and trying to hunt down a charger of a teenager's rooms that are sleeping.

4946
06:12:41,887 --> 06:12:43,967
[SPEAKER_51]: So bear with me if I don't hear.

4947
06:12:44,387 --> 06:12:46,067
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Counselor Scott Pelley.

4948
06:12:46,267 --> 06:12:47,248
[SPEAKER_37]: Appreciate the update.

4949
06:12:47,628 --> 06:12:49,188
[SPEAKER_37]: If I want to hear, the feed is back.

4950
06:12:49,468 --> 06:12:52,649
[SPEAKER_37]: It's back on, I guess, just to give everyone an update.

4951
06:12:54,471 --> 06:13:04,222
[SPEAKER_37]: Notice of a public hearing, legal notice 20-480, petition for grant of location, National Grid, Incorporated of North Andover, Massachusetts, Medford, Massachusetts City Clerk's Office.

4952
06:13:04,623 --> 06:13:11,350

4953
06:13:11,450 --> 06:13:13,453

06:13:15,925 --> 06:13:37,671

4956
06:13:42,728 --> 06:13:43,129
[SPEAKER_37]: July 24, 2020.

4957
06:13:43,569 --> 06:13:48,538
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading in favor of a brief synopsis from the petitioner.

4958
06:13:48,558 --> 06:13:53,546
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Counselor Pierce.

4959
06:13:53,566 --> 06:13:57,132
[SPEAKER_37]: If we may have a brief synopsis from John Jankowski, please.

4960
06:13:58,157 --> 06:14:01,300
[SPEAKER_48]: Yes, John Chankowski, 170 Method Street in Malden, Mass.

4961
06:14:01,320 --> 06:14:09,708
[SPEAKER_48]: We're going to install two four-inch PVC corners from an existing manhole, probably about 25 feet to 31 slash 35 Salem Street.

4962
06:14:09,908 --> 06:14:14,352
[SPEAKER_48]: It's going to be a restaurant for our electric service.

4963
06:14:15,273 --> 06:14:18,396
[SPEAKER_48]: Any questions I could, you know, consider that?

4964
06:14:19,226 --> 06:14:20,086
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, thank you, John.

4965
06:14:20,907 --> 06:14:23,147
[SPEAKER_37]: So at this point, I declare the public hearing open.

4966
06:14:23,167 --> 06:14:25,428
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll open to those in favor of the petition.

4967
06:14:25,728 --> 06:14:28,549
[SPEAKER_37]: John, is it safe to assume that you are in favor of this petition?

4968
06:14:30,010 --> 06:14:30,950
[SPEAKER_48]: Excuse me, I am.

4969
06:14:31,510 --> 06:14:32,711
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, thank you very much.

4970
06:14:33,471 --> 06:14:37,012
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone else in favor of the petition that would like to speak?

4971
06:14:39,193 --> 06:14:43,394
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

4972
06:14:44,054 --> 06:14:45,735
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone in opposition of the petition?

4973
06:14:47,270 --> 06:14:50,313
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone in opposition to the petition that would like to speak?

4974
06:14:51,575 --> 06:14:54,318
[SPEAKER_37]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

4975
06:14:55,319 --> 06:14:56,740
[SPEAKER_37]: Are there any questions from the council?

4976
06:14:58,142 --> 06:14:58,662
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Knight.

4977
06:14:59,583 --> 06:15:05,870
[SPEAKER_43]: Going forward, Mr. President, as a practice, I feel as though it might be appropriate for us to not hold public hearings at 1 o'clock in the morning.

4978
06:15:07,652 --> 06:15:08,192
[SPEAKER_37]: I would agree.

4979
06:15:08,713 --> 06:15:28,383
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think that, you know, when looking at the way that things have been going and the length of our meetings as of recent due to this wonderful technological advancement that we're using here to promote transparent government, that, you know, we might have to adopt a rule of some sort or amend our rules, Mr. President, to keep these meetings to be within a reasonable timeframe.

4980
06:15:29,543 --> 06:15:34,566
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, I think all the studies that we've ever read will show that meetings aren't productive if they last more than two hours.

4981
06:15:34,806 --> 06:15:36,367
[SPEAKER_43]: And we're going on about six now and it's

4982
06:15:37,459 --> 06:15:37,980
[SPEAKER_43]: 1.30 in the morning.

4983
06:15:38,240 --> 06:15:41,902
[SPEAKER_43]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem with the paper.

4984
06:15:41,922 --> 06:15:43,183
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll move for approval this evening.

4985
06:15:43,623 --> 06:15:50,127
[SPEAKER_43]: But it does raise concern that we're having a public hearing at 1 o'clock in the morning that was advertised for 7 o'clock in the evening yesterday.

4986
06:15:52,949 --> 06:15:57,171
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilman.

4987
06:15:57,291 --> 06:15:58,332
[SPEAKER_37]: I hear where you're coming from.

4988
06:15:58,792 --> 06:15:59,753
[SPEAKER_37]: This was a long meeting.

4989
06:16:00,073 --> 06:16:01,374
[SPEAKER_37]: This is our first meeting in a while.

4990
06:16:01,394 --> 06:16:04,115
[SPEAKER_37]: So I think there was a backlog of granted locations.

4991
06:16:04,175 --> 06:16:05,196
[SPEAKER_37]: And there were other issues that

4992
06:16:05,649 --> 06:16:07,329
[SPEAKER_42]: No explanation necessary, Mr. President.

4993
06:16:07,409 --> 06:16:11,910
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm just saying, as a practice going forward, I think that this might be not the best of them.

4994
06:16:12,590 --> 06:16:13,070
[SPEAKER_37]: I understand.

4995
06:16:14,411 --> 06:16:15,551
[SPEAKER_37]: OK, let's see.

4996
06:16:15,571 --> 06:16:18,831
[SPEAKER_37]: So on the motion of Council Night to approve, seconded by?

4997
06:16:18,851 --> 06:16:21,672
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded.

4998
06:16:23,512 --> 06:16:25,752
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by Councilor, Vice President Cabrillo.

4999
06:16:25,772 --> 06:16:27,013
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

5000
06:16:28,273 --> 06:16:29,353
[SPEAKER_44]: He was drinking water.

5001
06:16:29,393 --> 06:16:30,253
[SPEAKER_44]: He couldn't have seconded.

5002
06:16:30,713 --> 06:16:31,373
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, he didn't.

5003
06:16:31,773 --> 06:16:33,194
[SPEAKER_44]: He was a ventriloquist.

5004
06:16:33,314 --> 06:16:34,974
[SPEAKER_44]: He definitely didn't second it.

5005
06:16:35,749 --> 06:16:36,109
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

5006
06:16:38,391 --> 06:16:39,952
[SPEAKER_37]: All it means, I did it too.

5007
06:16:40,072 --> 06:16:42,133
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Beers.

5008
06:16:42,193 --> 06:16:43,754
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk Kernanby, please call the roll.

5009
06:16:44,955 --> 06:16:48,658
[SPEAKER_57]: All right, so Councilor Knight moved for approval, seconded by Councilor Beers.

5010
06:16:49,218 --> 06:16:49,318
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

5011
06:16:49,338 --> 06:16:49,979
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Beers.

5012
06:16:50,719 --> 06:16:51,339
[SPEAKER_29]: Absolutely.

5013
06:16:52,200 --> 06:16:53,241
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Caravello.

5014
06:16:53,421 --> 06:16:53,701
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

5015
06:16:54,281 --> 06:16:54,762
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight.

06:17:28,234 --> 06:17:31,575
[SPEAKER_57]: Is Councilor Behrs moving to revert with Vice President Caviello second?

5034
06:17:33,319 --> 06:17:33,900

[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

5038
06:17:37,526 --> 06:17:37,846
[SPEAKER_57]: Tonight.

5039
06:17:38,187 --> 06:17:38,487
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes.

5040
06:17:39,188 --> 06:17:39,469
[SPEAKER_57]: Marks.

5041
06:17:41,171 --> 06:17:41,772
[SPEAKER_57]: Council Morrell.

5042
06:17:42,333 --> 06:17:42,693
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

5043
06:17:43,094 --> 06:17:43,254
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

5044
06:17:45,421 --> 06:17:46,121
[SPEAKER_57]: President Falco.

5045
06:17:46,561 --> 06:17:48,882
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, Senate affirmative, zero in the negative.

5046
06:17:50,342 --> 06:17:52,543
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes, we'll revert to the regular order of business.

5047
06:17:52,563 --> 06:18:04,666
[SPEAKER_37]: 2-0-499 offered by Councilor Behrs and Councilor Morrell, whereas the reproduction rate of COVID-19 in Massachusetts is hovering above one, meaning that exponential spread of the virus is possible.

5048
06:18:04,726 --> 06:18:07,727
[SPEAKER_37]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request

5049
06:18:08,087 --> 06:18:24,616
[SPEAKER_37]: that the mayor and health director provide an update on the city's reopening plan and whether Memphis should slow or reverse our reopening schedule given the COVID-19 surge across the country in the reoccurrence of case spikes in regions that previously brought COVID-19 under control.

5050
06:18:25,917 --> 06:18:31,020
[SPEAKER_37]: At this point I recognize both Councilor Beers and Councilor Morrell and I should want to go first

5051
06:18:33,804 --> 06:18:39,565
[SPEAKER_29]: I will be brief and then leave it to Councilor Morrell and just say that this virus is unpredictable.

5052
06:18:40,025 --> 06:18:42,166
[SPEAKER_29]: We are at a low case count in Massachusetts right now.

5053
06:18:42,286 --> 06:18:43,506
[SPEAKER_29]: That could change very quickly.

5054
06:18:44,126 --> 06:19:01,569
[SPEAKER_29]: Given the fact that it's 1.20 in the morning and not many people are left paying attention, I would appreciate if the administration could give a written update along these lines as to whether or not they've considered reversing reopenings or slowing things down and share that with the council and with the public in a relatively timely manner.

5055
06:19:02,029 --> 06:19:02,329
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

5056
06:19:03,100 --> 06:19:03,940
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Counselor Harris.

5057
06:19:03,980 --> 06:19:04,540
[SPEAKER_31]: Counselor Morrell.

5058
06:19:05,201 --> 06:19:05,961
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

5059
06:19:06,001 --> 06:19:06,921
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I'll also be brief.

5060
06:19:06,961 --> 06:19:21,825
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to add that as of yesterday, our seven-day average of new positive cases in the state of Massachusetts was the highest it's been in a month and a half, which is just to say, I mean, the numbers are still lower than many other states, but this is just to say this is very much an ongoing situation that we have to be nimble with.

5061
06:19:22,545 --> 06:19:30,848
[SPEAKER_31]: So I just look forward to getting that written response from the administration about plans moving forward and how we might adjust depending on the information coming out.

5062
06:19:31,348 --> 06:19:31,688
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

5063
06:19:32,168 --> 06:19:32,428
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

5064
06:19:33,454 --> 06:19:35,035
[SPEAKER_37]: Any other councils like to speak on the issue?

5065
06:19:35,055 --> 06:19:37,636
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, anyone from the public?

5066
06:19:38,976 --> 06:19:43,638
[SPEAKER_37]: Seeing and hearing none, on the motion of Councilor Behrs and Councilor Morrell, seconded by?

5067
06:19:43,658 --> 06:19:44,678
[SPEAKER_37]: Second.

5068
06:19:45,279 --> 06:19:47,359
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Carabiello, Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

5069
06:19:50,020 --> 06:19:50,621
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Behrs?

5070
06:19:51,301 --> 06:19:51,581
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

5071
06:19:52,281 --> 06:19:53,182
[SPEAKER_57]: Vice President Carabiello?

5072
06:19:53,582 --> 06:19:53,882
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

5073
06:19:54,342 --> 06:19:54,842
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight?

5074
06:19:56,803 --> 06:19:58,204
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Knight has the lead, yes.

5075
06:19:59,484 --> 06:20:00,805
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay, Councilor Marks?

5076
06:20:01,265 --> 06:20:01,505
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

5077
06:20:02,332 --> 06:20:02,912
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Morrell?

5078
06:20:03,512 --> 06:20:03,752
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

5079
06:20:04,253 --> 06:20:05,053
[SPEAKER_57]: Councilor Scarpelli?

5080
06:20:08,414 --> 06:20:09,974
[SPEAKER_57]: We may have lost Councilor Scarpelli as well.

5081
06:20:10,435 --> 06:20:12,095
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I'm not sure if his line might be dead.

5082
06:20:12,135 --> 06:20:13,415
[SPEAKER_37]: I know he's looking for a charger.

5083
06:20:13,435 --> 06:20:20,178
[SPEAKER_37]: I know, I think Councilor Niedenthal, I think one of his kids woke up, so I think he was going to attend to that, so.

5084
06:20:21,698 --> 06:20:21,918
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

5085
06:20:23,018 --> 06:20:25,299
[SPEAKER_37]: So I believe that is five in the- Five zero two.

5086
06:20:25,659 --> 06:20:27,940
[SPEAKER_37]: Five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, two absent.

5087
06:20:28,500 --> 06:20:29,260
[SPEAKER_37]: The motion passes.

5088
06:20:29,280 --> 06:20:29,881
[SPEAKER_37]: Two zero dash 500.

5089
06:20:31,283 --> 06:20:32,465
[SPEAKER_37]: Offered by Councilor Beers.

5090
06:20:32,865 --> 06:20:46,644
[SPEAKER_37]: Beers, I'll let the Memphis City Council, that the appropriate city staff be invited to attend a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss the review of the city website mentioned by the mayor during the fiscal year 21 budget negotiations.

5091
06:20:47,125 --> 06:20:47,806
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Beers.

5092
06:20:48,783 --> 06:20:49,663
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

5093
06:20:50,584 --> 06:20:51,824
[SPEAKER_29]: Pretty self-explanatory.

5094
06:20:51,964 --> 06:20:54,105
[SPEAKER_29]: A West City website review was mentioned.

5095
06:20:54,525 --> 06:20:56,886
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd like it to be discussed with the council.

5096
06:20:57,426 --> 06:21:06,730
[SPEAKER_29]: It's also along the lines of a couple of resolutions that the council passed that I proposed, I think at our June 30th meeting regarding council communications and subcommittees.

5097
06:21:06,790 --> 06:21:15,454
[SPEAKER_29]: So whether those could be back to back or in one meeting, whatever is preferable, I just think the topics are interrelated and something we should be taking a look at.

5098
06:21:15,674 --> 06:21:15,974
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

5099
06:21:16,584 --> 06:21:17,945

06:26:07,875 --> 06:26:07,975
[SPEAKER_53]: Yeah.

5217
06:26:08,055 --> 06:26:08,275
[SPEAKER_53]: Okay.

5218
06:26:08,295 --> 06:26:09,916
[SPEAKER_53]: So because of the hour, I'm going to drop this one.

5219
06:26:10,136 --> 06:26:10,437
[SPEAKER_53]: All right.

5220
06:26:10,497 --> 06:26:11,857
[SPEAKER_53]: I mean, we could take it up at another time.

5221
06:26:11,878 --> 06:26:13,098
[SPEAKER_53]: So I'm just going to move on to the next one.

5222
06:26:13,118 --> 06:26:13,378
[SPEAKER_53]: All right.

5223
06:26:13,398 --> 06:26:14,419
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

5224
06:26:15,159 --> 06:26:17,901
[SPEAKER_37]: The next one you are respectfully prayed for to speak

5225
06:26:18,328 --> 06:26:21,170
[SPEAKER_37]: On the matter concerning City Council agility.

5226
06:26:21,830 --> 06:26:26,693
[SPEAKER_53]: Yeah, so this is this is kind of much larger issue, but I think we should just I'll just want to focus on a specific issue.

5227
06:26:27,674 --> 06:26:32,096
[SPEAKER_53]: And that's that, you know, last year, a resolution was raised on April 9 and it

5228
06:26:33,669 --> 06:26:38,371
[SPEAKER_53]: jumped around a lot during the summer and went to the subcommittee on ordinances and went to committee the whole.

5229
06:26:38,991 --> 06:26:42,232
[SPEAKER_53]: And then it basically ended on September 11th.

5230
06:26:43,532 --> 06:26:50,155
[SPEAKER_53]: And then on the September 24th meeting was when the report on that September 11th meeting was accepted by the council.

5231
06:26:50,695 --> 06:26:53,156
[SPEAKER_53]: Since then, I mean, I'm talking about the Gender Equity Commission.

5232
06:26:53,556 --> 06:26:58,818
[SPEAKER_53]: Since then, Councilor Morrell brought it up on January 7th and then again on June 23rd.

5233
06:27:00,138 --> 06:27:07,565
[SPEAKER_53]: So I know that there are a lot of high priority things that everybody's working on, but I think that this one's actually been sitting on the docket, just languishing for a while.

5234
06:27:08,246 --> 06:27:10,508
[SPEAKER_53]: John, I mean, I know I reached out to you a couple of weeks ago.

5235
06:27:10,548 --> 06:27:11,289
[SPEAKER_53]: I left a voicemail.

5236
06:27:11,329 --> 06:27:12,129
[SPEAKER_53]: I don't know if you heard it.

5237
06:27:12,410 --> 06:27:24,180
[SPEAKER_53]: What I'm actually asking for from the council, and I know that people did it because they did it earlier today, is that this gets, this thing's been languishing, you know, it's just been languishing on the committee with no action, that some, that it gets,

5238
06:27:24,921 --> 06:27:28,942
[SPEAKER_53]: placed, you know, scheduled with an agenda before a full year is up.

5239
06:27:29,062 --> 06:27:30,023
[SPEAKER_53]: That means before September 11.

5240
06:27:31,383 --> 06:27:32,104
[SPEAKER_53]: That's all I'm asking.

5241
06:27:32,344 --> 06:27:34,384
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm asking that somebody will kind of, you know, introduce that.

5242
06:27:34,644 --> 06:27:43,587
[SPEAKER_53]: And if there's anything that's left, perhaps, perhaps there's a question, maybe somebody has to ask the acting city solicitor for more information, then I think that should be introduced as well.

5243
06:27:43,768 --> 06:27:46,929
[SPEAKER_53]: It's really that just schedule a meeting, just put on the agenda before September 11.

5244
06:27:46,969 --> 06:27:47,949
[SPEAKER_53]: That's all I'm asking.

5245
06:27:49,134 --> 06:27:50,395
[SPEAKER_37]: I appreciate you bringing it up.

5246
06:27:50,435 --> 06:27:55,139
[SPEAKER_37]: We have had many, I would say, competing priorities this year.

5247
06:27:55,559 --> 06:28:00,543
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'll be honest with you, I mean, I'm looking at my, I have my calendar here that I always keep with me.

5248
06:28:01,224 --> 06:28:04,867
[SPEAKER_37]: And it's not that this council has not been meeting.

5249
06:28:04,987 --> 06:28:08,850
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, here we are, this is our 25th meeting of the year.

5250
06:28:11,132 --> 06:28:12,673
[SPEAKER_37]: 25th regular meeting of the year.

5251
06:28:13,353 --> 06:28:17,097
[SPEAKER_37]: We have had, I can tell you right now, last night we had our 28th

5252
06:28:17,950 --> 06:28:18,852
[SPEAKER_37]: committee the whole meeting.

5253
06:28:19,794 --> 06:28:24,285
[SPEAKER_37]: So we're averaging basically two meetings a week, which, you know, meet two meetings a week.

5254
06:28:25,104 --> 06:28:32,406
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, so we're working, and we're working hard, and there's a lot of- I understand, but I mean, nothing's been happening since September 11th.

5255
06:28:32,546 --> 06:28:34,787
[SPEAKER_37]: If I may finish, please, okay?

5256
06:28:34,847 --> 06:28:39,528
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'm not trying to say that this isn't a priority, because it is.

5257
06:28:39,668 --> 06:28:41,248
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, everything is a priority.

5258
06:28:41,268 --> 06:28:42,909
[SPEAKER_37]: We have a lot of competing priorities.

5259
06:28:43,589 --> 06:28:48,730
[SPEAKER_37]: Some of the big things that we've been meeting on were the marijuana ordinances.

5260
06:28:48,770 --> 06:28:50,470
[SPEAKER_37]: We had a number of those that we had to pass.

5261
06:28:50,951 --> 06:28:52,091
[SPEAKER_37]: We're still working on those.

5262
06:28:52,631 --> 06:28:55,614
[SPEAKER_37]: We have zoning is a huge priority that as well.

5263
06:28:56,234 --> 06:29:01,680
[SPEAKER_37]: And, you know, we've had the budget, you know, that basically, you know, that's a bunch of meetings.

5264
06:29:02,240 --> 06:29:06,744
[SPEAKER_37]: And, but I mean, it's not for, it's not like this committee is not working.

5265
06:29:06,825 --> 06:29:08,366
[SPEAKER_37]: We're working, we're working hard.

5266
06:29:09,267 --> 06:29:11,929
[SPEAKER_37]: Like I said, there's a lot of competing priorities that is on the list.

5267
06:29:12,049 --> 06:29:17,755
[SPEAKER_37]: I can assure you that food trucks, I mean, we have all kinds of things that are on the list every week.

5268
06:29:18,905 --> 06:29:22,526
[SPEAKER_37]: The council has added new things to community the whole, which is fine.

5269
06:29:22,586 --> 06:29:23,206
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's great.

5270
06:29:23,226 --> 06:29:24,526
[SPEAKER_37]: We have plenty of things to work on.

5271
06:29:24,566 --> 06:29:26,207
[SPEAKER_37]: There's no shortage of things to work on.

5272
06:29:26,907 --> 06:29:28,507
[SPEAKER_37]: That's on the list, I can assure you that.

5273
06:29:29,127 --> 06:29:30,687
[SPEAKER_37]: And we will schedule a meeting soon.

5274
06:29:31,428 --> 06:29:34,928
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm asking for before a full year is over, before September 11th.

5275
06:29:34,968 --> 06:29:38,109
[SPEAKER_53]: The last time any action had been taken was on September 11th of last year.

5276
06:29:38,489 --> 06:29:41,310
[SPEAKER_53]: We could talk about the coronavirus and the pandemic.

5277
06:29:41,330 --> 06:29:42,570
[SPEAKER_53]: That's the really only thing in March.

5278
06:29:42,850 --> 06:29:44,170
[SPEAKER_37]: That's the only thing that happened in March.

5279
06:29:44,350 --> 06:29:45,150
[SPEAKER_37]: That's not my game.

5280
06:29:45,611 --> 06:29:47,251
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'm not blaming it on coronavirus, OK?

5281
06:29:48,356 --> 06:29:50,558
[SPEAKER_37]: We lost two weeks to coronavirus, this council.

5282
06:29:51,039 --> 06:29:55,463
[SPEAKER_37]: This council has met religiously, I mean, basically week after week.

5283
06:29:56,184 --> 06:30:00,168
[SPEAKER_37]: So, I'm not blaming anything on coronavirus, okay?

5284
06:30:00,669 --> 06:30:03,332
[SPEAKER_37]: We missed two weeks out of this session to coronavirus.

5285
06:30:04,758 --> 06:30:07,640
[SPEAKER_53]: Okay, look, John, I'm not trying to attack anybody on the council.

5286
06:30:07,680 --> 06:30:11,161
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm just asking, before a year passes, can some action be taken?

5287
06:30:11,181 --> 06:30:18,225
[SPEAKER_53]: Because else I could see the trajectory over the past eight months or so that this could just keep getting pushed down until some other more convenient time.

5288
06:30:18,245 --> 06:30:22,367
[SPEAKER_53]: I mean, a lot of times when I'm not getting around to stuff, sometimes I know I just have to put it on the calendar.

5289
06:30:22,407 --> 06:30:23,928
[SPEAKER_53]: I just have to schedule it.

5290
06:30:24,308 --> 06:30:24,809
[SPEAKER_37]: I understand.

5291
06:30:24,829 --> 06:30:25,509
[SPEAKER_37]: I understand.

5292
06:30:25,549 --> 06:30:29,111
[SPEAKER_37]: And there's things that come up that we can't control either that have to be met on.

5293
06:30:29,131 --> 06:30:30,672
[SPEAKER_37]: Like we had to meet with MassDOT.

5294
06:30:31,631 --> 06:30:33,472
[SPEAKER_37]: with regard to issues back in February.

5295
06:30:34,213 --> 06:30:37,035
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, CPA projects come on that we have to meet with as well.

5296
06:30:37,095 --> 06:30:46,721
[SPEAKER_37]: So, I mean, like I said, there's competing priorities, there's no real intent here, believe me, I can assure you of that, but I will tell you that it will get on the agenda, okay?

5297
06:30:47,481 --> 06:30:53,525
[SPEAKER_53]: Earlier this evening, there were a few things that were spoken about and they were put on the Committee of the Whole right quick, even though they were introduced a lot later than this.

5298
06:30:54,844 --> 06:30:59,287
[SPEAKER_53]: Okay, and earlier this evening, people also voted to set something on a particular date.

5299
06:30:59,347 --> 06:31:04,531
[SPEAKER_53]: So I know this council can say, we will do something before a particular date.

5300
06:31:04,571 --> 06:31:08,895
[SPEAKER_37]: There are certain things that we talked about tonight that actually have to be done by a certain date.

5301
06:31:08,915 --> 06:31:15,540
[SPEAKER_53]: Many things that have been introduced after this initiative that were already put on the committee to hold.

5302
06:31:16,300 --> 06:31:18,222
[SPEAKER_37]: I can tell you, we've been working on marijuana.

5303
06:31:18,792 --> 06:31:24,174
[SPEAKER_53]: the marijuana ordinance for the better part of probably many, many, many, all I'm, all I'm asking, are you telling me yes or no?

5304
06:31:24,234 --> 06:31:26,574
[SPEAKER_53]: Is it possible to schedule this before September 11th?

5305
06:31:28,115 --> 06:31:31,156
[SPEAKER_53]: Possibly possibly, but it's a yes or no.

5306
06:31:31,216 --> 06:31:32,596
[SPEAKER_37]: If I may, if I may.

5307
06:31:32,836 --> 06:31:33,117
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

5308
06:31:33,517 --> 06:31:41,839
[SPEAKER_37]: We have marijuana that's coming before us because that came back from the CD board with changes that has to get done by a certain timeframe by law.

5309
06:31:42,519 --> 06:31:42,820
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

5310
06:31:43,260 --> 06:31:46,201
[SPEAKER_37]: So that has to be done by law by a certain timeframe.

5311
06:31:46,221 --> 06:31:47,281
[SPEAKER_37]: So we have to get that in.

5312
06:31:48,038 --> 06:31:51,539
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, and then we have, you know, then we'll get a hit September.

5313
06:31:51,620 --> 06:31:57,522
[SPEAKER_37]: And then, you know, I don't have everything written down in front of me right now, but- I'm just asking about city council rules.

5314
06:31:57,862 --> 06:31:59,103
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm just asking about city council rules.

5315
06:31:59,183 --> 06:32:05,445
[SPEAKER_37]: I wasn't stating rules, but what I'm saying is there are a boatload of things that have to be discussed in committee of the whole.

5316
06:32:06,165 --> 06:32:12,788
[SPEAKER_37]: I asked, I asked clerk Herbies, I think probably two weeks ago, and he sent me the list of everything that's in committee of the whole.

5317
06:32:13,408 --> 06:32:14,769
[SPEAKER_37]: So there's quite a few things in there.

5318
06:32:15,189 --> 06:32:16,030
[SPEAKER_37]: We will meet on them.

5319
06:32:16,110 --> 06:32:16,950
[SPEAKER_37]: I promise you that.

5320
06:32:18,983 --> 06:32:22,526
[SPEAKER_53]: No, no, you say meet on, that could mean sometime two years from now.

5321
06:32:22,746 --> 06:32:24,287
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm asking for a commitment right now.

5322
06:32:24,528 --> 06:32:27,250
[SPEAKER_37]: Matt, it's not going to be two years from now, but I can't promise you.

5323
06:32:27,790 --> 06:32:28,411
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't want to do it.

5324
06:32:28,511 --> 06:32:31,433
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't want to basically make a promise that I can't actually keep.

5325
06:32:31,874 --> 06:32:35,637
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not going to, I can't tell you that by September 11th, it's going to be scheduled.

5326
06:32:35,777 --> 06:32:40,901
[SPEAKER_37]: I will try my best, but I can't promise you that just because it's, like I said, there's competing priorities.

5327
06:32:41,301 --> 06:32:43,101
[SPEAKER_37]: We're gonna get to it, I promise you, okay?

5328
06:32:43,121 --> 06:32:46,082
[SPEAKER_53]: I know, it's computing priorities, and the gender equity one is a lower priority.

5329
06:32:46,142 --> 06:32:47,062
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm not saying that.

5330
06:32:47,162 --> 06:32:48,643
[SPEAKER_53]: There's no other way to it.

5331
06:32:48,663 --> 06:32:49,883
[SPEAKER_33]: You said that, I did not.

5332
06:32:49,903 --> 06:32:50,723
[SPEAKER_33]: Matt, Matt.

5333
06:32:50,903 --> 06:32:52,624
[SPEAKER_53]: That's what you're communicating when you say that.

5334
06:32:52,864 --> 06:32:54,544
[SPEAKER_53]: It'll just have to be pushed back to later.

5335
06:32:54,864 --> 06:32:57,105
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, yeah.

5336
06:32:57,345 --> 06:32:59,425
[SPEAKER_53]: A year of no action communicates a lot.

5337
06:32:59,985 --> 06:33:00,326
[SPEAKER_53]: No, Matt.

5338
06:33:03,806 --> 06:33:04,607
[SPEAKER_53]: A year of no action.

5339
06:33:05,107 --> 06:33:10,448
[SPEAKER_29]: Most motion are received and placed on file, and make best efforts to schedule this promptly.

5340
06:33:11,172 --> 06:33:11,512
[SPEAKER_37]: Second.

5341
06:33:11,572 --> 06:33:15,914
[SPEAKER_37]: On a motion of God so be it, to replace up, uh, place on file.

[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by Councilor Caviello.

5343
06:33:19,475 --> 06:33:21,256
[SPEAKER_57]: Do we, do we receive in place on file?

5344
06:33:21,276 --> 06:33:22,797
[SPEAKER_57]: Cause it was public participation.

5345
06:33:22,957 --> 06:33:23,497
[SPEAKER_37]: Actually, correct.

5346
06:33:23,517 --> 06:33:26,098
[SPEAKER_37]: We don't, because it's actually, um, it's participation.

5347
06:33:26,118 --> 06:33:28,059
[SPEAKER_37]: So it doesn't have to be received and placed on file.

5348
06:33:28,299 --> 06:33:28,439
[SPEAKER_29]: Great.

5349
06:33:28,459 --> 06:33:31,841
[SPEAKER_29]: Well then just a motion that we make best efforts to schedule this promptly.
