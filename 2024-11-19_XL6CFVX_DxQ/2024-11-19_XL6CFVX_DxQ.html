order of the Medford City Council, Adam L. Hurtubise, City Clerk, this was advertised in the Boston Globe July 13th and July 20th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=387.887s">We</a>  also have received correspondence from Andre LaRue, who's the chair of the CD board. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=394.991s">That's</a>  dated July 20th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=397.833s">And</a>  I'm going to read that now, that's regarding Council Resolution 20-381, Proposed Amendment to Chapter 94 Zoning, Section 94-148D, Table of Use Regulations for Use 18, multiple dwelling not over three stories in height and <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=413.949s">Use</a>  19 multiple dwelling not over 75 feet or six stories in height to require at least 25% non-residential uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=421.436s">Following</a>  the duly advertised public hearing conducted on June 18, 2020, in July 16, 2020, the Community Development Board voted to recommend that the Medford City Council adopt the proposed amendment <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=433.627s">In</a>  the commercial 1, C1 in mixed-use zones, MUZ zoning districts, with the following changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=441.374s">For</a>  the proposed footnote to use 18 and use 19, number 3, remove the words 25% of the total floor area and replace with the first floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=453.024s">Two,</a>  for the proposed footnote <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=456.309s">to</a>  use 18 and use 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=458.07s">Number</a>  three, add the following language after the words overlying zoning district or business or professional office retail sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=469.637s">Consumer</a>  service business or eating place as defined in section 94-2 definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=475.521s">Following</a>  considerable discussion, the Community Development Board made no recommendation on the proposed amendment to the APT <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=482.972s">apartment</a>  one in APT, apartment two zoning districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=486.153s">Thank</a>  you for your consideration of these recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=489.173s">Audrey</a>  LaRue, chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=490.894s">At</a>  this point, I declare this public hearing open. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=494.114s">Would</a>  anybody like to speak in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=510.438s">Anyone</a>  like to speak in favor of the petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=516.8s">Yep,</a>  let's see, we have Chief of Staff, Dave Rodriguez.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=522.583s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and sorry, I was looking for the raise hand function, I couldn't find it, so I just did it the old fashioned way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=529.446s">I</a>  appreciate the comments that were made by the Community Development Board, their careful consideration that was made after a number of meetings that were constructive and <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=538.79s">of</a>  thoughtful and very substantive. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=541.152s">And</a>  the mayor agrees with the changes that are recommended by this community development board. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=545.536s">She</a>  thinks that it achieves the policy objectives that were put forth and spurred off a good conversation that happened at the city board at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=553.023s">So</a>  we hope the council will give it careful consideration as well.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=558.268s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=560.77s">Would</a>  anybody else like to speak in favor of the petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=566.886s">Okay,</a>  seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=571.129s">Now</a>  I open this up to anyone in opposition of the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=574.511s">Is</a>  there anyone in opposition that would like to speak?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=592.023s">Mr.</a>  President, I see someone has a hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=593.804s">Navarre?</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=594.805s">Yes,</a>  Will. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=595.526s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=598.061s">One</a>  minute, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=602.903s">Please</a>  have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=604.983s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=606.244s">I</a>  hope you can hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=608.444s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=609.525s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=616.468s">The</a>  goal as I understand this, Mr. President, and I might not be super familiar with the changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=622.769s">I'm</a>  not sure if we're still considering whether or not it'll be an apartment one and an apartment two, but I'm commenting as if it is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=631.451s">The</a>  goal as I understand it is to increase the commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=636.872s">I</a>  have major equity concerns with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=639.892s">The</a>  present system of taxation gives a discount to housing owners, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=645.66s">by</a>  taxing housing land and housing improvements at a lower rate than ones that are commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=652.409s">However,</a>  on the other side of that, it provides an incentive to create housing that housing seekers will enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=659.899s">And</a>  this seems to subvert that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=662.984s">housing</a>  owners continue to get their discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=666.248s">And</a>  it's really tough for housing seekers to have supply built for them because you got to put in commercial in order to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=675.2s">So</a>  I'm a little bit concerned that this is going to hamper housing production. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=678.444s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=681.289s">And</a>  I would suggest the alternative proposal that if the city wants to see more commercial go in, they consider removing that disincentive to commercial, the higher mill rate, which encourages you to put in housing rather than commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=698.857s">You</a>  can just look at some of the assessments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=702.86s">You</a>  can see that even though the bill rate is nominally higher in commercial, you can see that as a relation to land value, this is sort of what you start with and you hope they build up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=713.766s">You</a>  can see that the commercial properties often pay a smaller ratio of their land value in taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=719.97s">And</a>  that's because some commercial is not very developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=723.492s">An</a>  obvious example would be on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=726.772s">But</a>  the new housing is, of course, well-developed, with lots of assessed improvements at each dollar of assessed land value. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=735.686s">Even</a>  at Wellington Plaza, where it's legitimately developed, it's not an empty lot, at 760 Fells Way, I think that's where the stop and shop is, sort of that wing of the plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=751.772s">They</a>  pay less as a ratio of land value than the housing across the way at Five Cabot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=759.974s">You</a>  might say that's a luxury development, but that means that they're paying a lot of improvement taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=766.067s">So</a>  when you get down to it, if you want to extract more from commercial, you can often do that just by having a flat land value tax, where you don't tax extra for the homeowners and the apartment owners for having buildings, you tax based on the value of the land that they deprive to others. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=784.982s">And</a>  since the rate is flat, and no matter what you put there, you pay the same amount of tax, that creates a free field with no favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=793.982s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=794.723s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=795.043s">We're</a>  going to take away the incentive to leave land unproductive, vacant or blighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=799.967s">The</a>  tax would furthermore encourage the owners of land on Mystic Avenue to sell it or develop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=807.554s">And</a>  that's true whether or not the city decides to rezone it residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=813.138s">They</a>  don't have to pay much taxes right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=815.24s">They</a>  can wait and wait and wait until you rezone it residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=819.544s">And</a>  some people don't want to do that and that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=824.008s">They</a>  got to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=824.988s">A</a>  land value tax doesn't even need to be a sudden and abrupt change that's got to cause chaos or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=834.311s">You</a>  can do it slowly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=836.292s">Maybe</a>  one year the taxes are going up a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=838.893s">You</a>  put all the increase on the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=841.113s">Maybe</a>  they're going down a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=842.754s">You</a>  take off the decrease off buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=846.235s">So</a>  it doesn't have to be a sudden change that shocks the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=852.537s">We</a>  need, and I should say that generally when you do that, homeowners, especially lower income homeowners and lower income neighborhoods generally get more of a tax break and less of a tax hike when you do it that way, rather than flat on each. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=868.982s">So</a>  it's not through this, the increase for homeowners, it's usually a decrease. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=874.474s">We</a>  do need more commercial city of Medford, but we also need more housing in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=880.916s">And</a>  we can get more of both by removing the tax break for those who hold land out of use in the form of parking lots, vacant lots, and low intensity businesses like the sprawling large car dealerships that are really glorified parking lots on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=895.602s">That's</a>  how we can get more commercial in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=897.723s">That's</a>  how we can get more housing in the city by using the land productively, by removing the discount for blight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=904.868s">and</a>  waste, and most of all, speculation as you wait for the city to improve around you to become richer or for the city council to rezone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=914.316s">They</a>  should build what it's zoned for, they should build commercial Mystic Valley, and they shouldn't be holding land hostage waiting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=923.503s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=925.124s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Navarre. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=926.966s">Let's</a>  see, we have... <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=935.891s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Kelly Catalo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=937.833s">Hello</a>  Kelly Catalo, 46 Otis Street in Medford on I understand that we need to do zoning changes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=944.742s">But</a>  first of all, I don't think that this should be happening in the middle of the summer and the middle of a pandemic when we can't even all be in the same room. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=953.192s">There</a>  are people that wanted to be part of this meeting tonight, but they can't communicate via a screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=959.195s">So</a>  if at some point you decide to put this off to another date, there are people that have valuable information to add to this that would like to be in the council chambers and do so in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=969.74s">What</a>  I will say is the way that this is written to bring commercial into apartment 1, apartment 2, or apartment 3 zones, I will tell you some of the apartment 1 zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=979.484s">If</a>  you're going up Oakland Street, which is across the street from City Hall, that's all houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=984.726s">But</a>  the right side of that is apartment 1 zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=988.028s">If</a>  I lived up there, I would not want stores or commercial property put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=993.47s">If</a>  you go down Riverside Avenue underneath the bridge from Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=998.232s">The</a>  right side of that is apartment one zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1001.673s">I</a>  wouldn't want stores all over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1003.534s">When</a>  we go down Main Street in Medford, we're talking apartment one and apartment two zones, and it just doesn't work for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1011.417s">As</a>  far as the mixed use zoning districts, Medford Square, we've been asking for mixed use zoning for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1018.38s">I</a>  would love for that to be part of this amendment here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1021.761s">that</a>  we can have apartments as well as commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1024.742s">And</a>  it's not that we're trying to take away things, but we have a lot of vacant storefronts across our city, and you're going to see a lot more due to COVID in people working from home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1036.264s">I</a>  love the recommendations from the Community Development Board, except for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1041.086s">I</a>  don't think that you should require the commercial to be ground level, because maybe the commercial piece is something that's on the same lot, like what we're seeing across the street from Wegmans, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1051.628s">We</a>  still have a bank on the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1053.189s">Maybe</a>  that bank makes up that 25% that is needed in that zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1057.811s">The</a>  other thing that we're seeing is a lot of the apartment houses and the complexes that are being built are talking with companies like WeWork, and maybe that's on the sixth floor, but it's a level of commercial property for people to be able to work at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1075.24s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1076.201s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1081.721s">Anyone</a>  else against? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1083.083s">In</a>  opposition? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1083.844s">Okay,</a>  we have Derek Anderson. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1086.687s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1092.254s">Oh,</a>  Derek Anderson, 16 Myrtle Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1094.984s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1097.705s">I</a>  am against this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1099.325s">I</a>  would like to second a lot of what Kelly has just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1103.106s">Mixed</a>  use is very important for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1106.207s">Adding</a>  more commercial is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1108.267s">I</a>  love the idea of having commercial in some of those apartment zones and commercial zones that are affected by this amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1115.049s">I'm</a>  thinking particularly along Salem Street, a great place for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1118.57s">But</a>  there are places that are affected by this amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1122.874s">Kelly's</a>  mentioned a number of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1124.175s">I</a>  think Riverside Ave, everything along Riverside Ave from downtown Medford to Locust Street, from Riverside Ave to the river would be affected by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1133.042s">So</a>  there would be no multi dwelling apartments greater than two units, unless it's an attached single family home that would be allowed in that entire section of town from now on, unless they put in 25% commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1144.554s">There</a>  just aren't developers out there that are going to build that kind of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1147.557s">This</a>  is a ban on multi-dwelling housing in a number of areas of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1152.603s">It's</a>  completely inappropriate to try to have this sort of quick fix zoning amendment to what is really begging for a comprehensive zoning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1162.774s">And</a>  I know that our community development group is doing a housing plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1166.894s">resilience</a>  plan, they're going out for comprehensive planning, all those things can feed into real zoning reform, and I'm optimistic that that can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1177.343s">But</a>  we need to let that process unfold. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1180.226s">This</a>  kind of quick fix is going to have lots of unforeseen issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1185.785s">And</a>  I'm extremely concerned, particularly that there's a requirement for city council to approve, case by case, every single application that's proposed for multi-dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1196.83s">That's</a>  a huge change from where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1198.931s">It's</a>  totally inappropriate to put city council in that place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1202.033s">I</a>  assume that you guys don't wanna be put in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1205.394s">I</a>  certainly wouldn't wanna be put in that position of having politics inserted into every single application. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1211.417s">And</a>  it's just the wrong way to go about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1216.089s">Point</a>  of information Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1218.451s">This</a>  is a public hearing in favor or against. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1221.835s">It</a>  should be ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1222.676s">We</a>  have 35 items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1224.297s">If</a>  we allow the dialogue to continue for four or five minutes on every item on the agenda this evening, we're going to be here until tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1231.985s">I</a>  appreciate what Mr. Anderson has to say and I agree with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1234.167s">I'm</a>  not going to be supporting the zoning amendment this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1236.129s">I'm</a>  going to vote to reject it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1237.675s">for</a>  the reasons that I stated when it was introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1240.096s">However,</a>  in the interest of getting through the agenda, Mr. President, I think it might be important for us to maybe limit the time of public participation this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1247.781s">We</a>  have 35 items on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1249.922s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1253.284s">Derek,</a>  did you want to conclude?</p>

    <p>[Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1256.377s">Sure,</a>  and I appreciate your position, Councilor Knight, and I apologize for taking a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1261.341s">I</a>  am passionate on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1262.883s">I'll</a>  just conclude, it's inappropriate to have City Council involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1266.486s">This</a>  is a citywide ban that's totally inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1269.108s">This</a>  is not the way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1270.189s">We</a>  do need commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1271.21s">I</a>  like the intent, but the implementation is wrong, and I'm against this.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1276.194s">Thank</a>  you very much, appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1279.096s">Is</a>  anyone else in opposition of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1282.999s">Anyone</a>  else in opposition that would like to speak?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1290.953s">Motion</a>  to close the public air.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1292.674s">We</a>  have one more person. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1294.075s">Let's</a>  see you, Roberta Cameron. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1296.136s">Would</a>  you like to speak?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1296.876s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1303.78s">I</a>  just wanted to mention one thing that I'm concerned about the the <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1311.029s">the</a>  uses that would be allowed within those districts are not necessarily the uses that are compatible with our vision of what mixed use looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1322.759s">It's</a>  that the underlying commercial uses that would be required to be located, co-located with commercial, with residential buildings are not necessarily the uses that would be compatible with that type of building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1338.755s">So</a>  I just wanted to add that to the argument.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1342.756s">Was</a>  that opposed, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1344.476s">Yes,</a>  opposed.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1345.536s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1387.544s">Yes,</a>  okay, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1389.464s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1392.521s">You</a>  know, we are in the process, as many residents know, we hired an attorney to help us with our review of our zoning ordinances that haven't been reviewed in over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1406.611s">I</a>  think many people in this community realize that there are many changes that need to happen, many updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1413.296s">And</a>  I would agree with some of the previous speakers that we really do need to look at a comprehensive amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1419.741s">And</a>  I appreciate the fact that the mayor is trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1422.643s">put</a>  forward what she believes is in the best interest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1426.267s">However,</a>  I'd like to look at a total picture when I arrive at a decision, and I don't believe this arrives at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1435.016s">There</a>  is an issue, Mr. President, I've raised on many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1438.299s">before</a>  the council and regarding zoning is the fact that we're seeing many buildings pop up that have very little community feel and community impact other than providing additional housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1452.992s">And</a>  I've always stated, Mr. President, that we have to make sure that we're not just creating big blocks <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1460.118s">residential</a>  places that really have no community feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1464.682s">So</a>  whatever I do as a member of the council, I'm going to be cognizant of the fact that I will be mindful of adding a component, like we mentioned about mixed use and so forth, and whatever votes I take, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1480.955s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1482.416s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1484.938s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>
