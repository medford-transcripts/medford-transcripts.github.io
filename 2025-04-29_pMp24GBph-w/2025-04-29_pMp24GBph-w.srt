13
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:49,206
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, it's really up to you guys.

14
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Bob's here for finance and maybe also an overview.

15
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:53,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Nina, you're here for an overview.

16
00:22:54,537 --> 00:23:00,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Pam's here for council on aging, whichever order you'd like to take that in, we'll take you.

17
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:17,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, President Bears, if it's okay with my colleagues, and I just organizationally think an overview probably to begin is the place to start, and I welcome any comments by Finance Director Dickinson as well.

18
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:25,746
[SPEAKER_00]: At a very high level, we're still reviewing the budgets that have been submitted by departments, and we presently have a deficit of about a million dollars.

19
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:33,512
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to monitor state and federal funds for both revenue and grants that are coming in, or potentially not.

20
00:23:33,772 --> 00:23:35,233
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hopefully not the case, but

21
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:41,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, that's a very active situation that's being monitored by every organization probably across

22
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:44,416
[SPEAKER_00]: the nation who receives any federal funds.

23
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:49,439
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to receive proposed increases from external organizations as well.

24
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:52,041
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are still coming in that formulate our budget as well.

25
00:23:52,982 --> 00:24:10,133
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen as the council knows, we've seen significant increases in waste, our waste contract and our waste costs as a community, but also with regard to health insurance, you know, those ones, but as we're reviewing budgets, we're also seeing significant contract increases across these budgets as well.

26
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:12,213
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a very high level.

27
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:15,455
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have for now.

28
00:24:17,195 --> 00:24:17,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

29
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:18,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Dickinson.

30
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:28,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just to affirm what I'm told they're going to get a longer gooseneck for this.

31
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Really easier.

32
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:31,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I guess.

33
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:32,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

34
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:34,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I take up too much space.

35
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:39,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's just to affirm what the chief of staff said.

36
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, we're still reviewing.

37
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,231
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got the for cherries sheets.

38
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:48,953
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got the House recommendation, but the Senate recommendation has not come through yet.

39
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:50,493
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously the finals aren't there.

40
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:54,315
[SPEAKER_08]: We're reviewing local receipts again.

41
00:24:54,335 --> 00:24:59,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, due to how the bills go out.

42
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:00,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have

43
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:07,298
[SPEAKER_08]: full numbers on what motor vehicle excise revenue will be this year, which allows us to predict what it will be next year.

44
00:25:07,318 --> 00:25:12,603
[SPEAKER_08]: It just adds to our five-year summary of all that.

45
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:16,927
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I've been reviewing.

46
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:28,077
[SPEAKER_08]: New growth with the assessor, and there's some fudge in there that we don't actually, you know, we have a number, but it could vary by

47
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,032
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, $150,000 each way.

48
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,614
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're continuing to review all this.

49
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:39,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you'll see from my budget, there's some increases that we can't avoid paying.

50
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,623
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to, we have to allow for that.

51
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:44,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where we are on the budget.

52
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:48,188
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Councilor Lazzaro.

53
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:50,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

54
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you presenting this.

55
00:25:52,982 --> 00:25:59,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me where the million dollar deficit is from just for our understanding?

56
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:07,356
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that additional gooseneck for me and Bob.

57
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:09,038
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of room for you.

58
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:09,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about that.

59
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:24,995
[SPEAKER_00]: I really couldn't answer that because we have a number of different budgets we're still going through, and it's not as if we've demarcated somehow where exactly the increase is.

60
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:29,619
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, we have a contract in the DPW budget that's going up 66%.

61
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,882
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I took that and added it up.

62
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:36,324
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a cumulative bottom line, unfortunately.

63
00:26:38,383 --> 00:26:48,808
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even know how to necessarily go about that, other than looking at each budget and potentially saying what's over, but that still might be under, so there's a netting there, if that makes any sense.

64
00:26:50,148 --> 00:27:01,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for anybody watching or whatever, just a budget the size of a million dollars kind of adds up quickly, and it seems like

65
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:10,945
[SPEAKER_02]: a significant amount that we are behind, but it's not necessarily because of one crazy line item.

66
00:27:10,985 --> 00:27:14,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just many numbers coming together.

67
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,641
[SPEAKER_02]: and forming that deficit number for this year.

68
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:25,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, President Bears, through you to Councilor Lazzaro, I appreciate that context that you've provided for those listening, and I agree with you.

69
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:29,611
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking about a 200 million plus dollar budget.

70
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:32,954
[SPEAKER_00]: $1 million on a $200 million budget is obviously half a percent.

71
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:43,082
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I really think it's not as bad as we've seen it in past years, but we also, and as the council knows, are keeping

72
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:54,138
[SPEAKER_00]: very close to our mind that we have major debt that's going to be added to the FY 27 budget next year and how that's going to affect the overall picture as well.

73
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:57,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

74
00:27:59,184 --> 00:28:01,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Just really quickly, I think, and I think it's important to clarify.

75
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,070
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a right now

76
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:17,669
[SPEAKER_04]: with the budgets that you're working with, when you say a deficit, you mean that right now we're projecting that our expenses, if we wanted to spend everything that all the departments want to spend right now, would be a million dollars more than the revenue that we would receive.

77
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:35,778
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not in a in a deficit, we are right now trying to figure out how to get expenses down to what we expect revenues to be or revenues up a little bit more before next fiscal year and this is for the budget starting July one and I just think that's just good context for anyone watching maybe for the first time to understand.

78
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:39,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're talking about next year's budget and

79
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:44,218
[SPEAKER_04]: from some of the documents and some of the conversation you just had.

80
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:51,059
[SPEAKER_04]: The real big things that are driving costs are the fixed costs that drive the budget up every year.

81
00:28:51,739 --> 00:29:02,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're talking about contractual obligations to our employees based on their union contracts, the healthcare through the state group insurance commission,

82
00:29:04,522 --> 00:29:11,524
[SPEAKER_04]: the pension liability that we're funding, and the DPW trash contract.

83
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:19,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, given just some of the preliminary numbers, we could argue that that million dollars comes from any one of the four budgets this year.

84
00:29:19,286 --> 00:29:22,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're all up about, I think even trash is almost up a million this year.

85
00:29:22,847 --> 00:29:28,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So we, as in past years, are seeing

86
00:29:30,984 --> 00:29:43,550
[SPEAKER_04]: that our fixed costs, the things that we need to pay because we are contractually obligated to provide them just to maintain existing services and the existing staff level are going up faster than our revenues are going up.

87
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is true even with the override.

88
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:50,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are where we were before.

89
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:59,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanna ask you one question, then I'll go to Councilor Callahan, which is if we had not passed the override, given where we're at at this point in the budget,

90
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:07,403
[SPEAKER_04]: what would we be looking at for our schools or for the city without those funds?

91
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:09,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

92
00:30:10,524 --> 00:30:13,585
[SPEAKER_00]: First to say, I appreciate the additional context you added as well.

93
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:18,687
[SPEAKER_00]: I think both your comments and Councilor Lazzaro's comments are right on.

94
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:29,391
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as what we'd be looking at, I wouldn't be able to provide any type of specific numbers at this stage, but I would say we'd be looking at cuts, significant cuts.

95
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:31,652
[SPEAKER_00]: if it wasn't for the override.

96
00:30:31,692 --> 00:30:41,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly appreciate the community making that happen because that was that that's significant for the schools, it's significant for the municipal side of the organization as well.

97
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

98
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:49,222
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think that's important grounding context for people are gonna hear Oh, well, we didn't override and we still have a deficit.

99
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:51,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's, that's how much things are.

100
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:53,045
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the costs are impacting us.

101
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:53,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan.

102
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:55,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

103
00:30:55,493 --> 00:30:59,034
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is actually also about the prop two and a half overrides.

104
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:15,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, my understanding is, and I want to make sure this is correct, and for anybody out there listening, that those overrides were passed one, you know, one for the schools, one for the schools plus roads, and at least in that first year that they do have to be spent on the schools.

105
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:24,540
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to make sure that that million dollars isn't going to come out of the override that we passed, which was designated for the schools, just want to be checking

106
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,742
[SPEAKER_00]: in on that.

107
00:31:26,882 --> 00:31:30,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, 100% confirming that President Bears through you to Councilor Callahan.

108
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:31,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

109
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:32,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

110
00:31:32,587 --> 00:31:32,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

111
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:33,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

112
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:35,469
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

113
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:39,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any other questions from members of the council at this time about the budget?

114
00:31:42,993 --> 00:31:47,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, I just have one more actual question on a grounding context comment.

115
00:31:48,235 --> 00:31:56,059
[SPEAKER_04]: You were mentioning, you're looking at local receipts and new growth, you're finalizing new growth, and you've looked at the cherry sheets.

116
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:07,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any hope that some portion of that million may come from maybe some amount of additional revenue as you finalize those numbers versus removing things from the budgets?

117
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:10,018
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be very nice.

118
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:12,019
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always hope.

119
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so, probably.

120
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,202
[SPEAKER_08]: But until we have firmer numbers, we don't know.

121
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

122
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:22,886
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to clarify, because it sounded like you said it could go either way.

123
00:32:23,286 --> 00:32:35,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just wondering, is it possible that it sounds like you're basing it like this is the revenue number that we're going to have, and most likely the revenue number is not going to change too significantly either direction?

124
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:38,216
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

125
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

126
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:40,900
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

127
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,661
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's no further questions on the general overview of the budget.

128
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:50,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could go directly to talking about this finance and procurement budget.

129
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think.

130
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think Shane has to turn them on for them to show up here.

131
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:07,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, all right, we'll stick with finance.

132
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just gonna read it out really quickly.

133
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,711
[SPEAKER_04]: We have fiscal 26 proposed personnel, 620,295.

134
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:14,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Fiscal 26 proposed ordinary expenses, 259,840 for a total of 881.35.

135
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:15,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's up from 854,314.

136
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:17,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So an increase of 25,800 or about 3%.

137
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:18,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is coming from

138
00:33:39,627 --> 00:33:43,570
[SPEAKER_04]: clerical contract raises and a 2% COLA for non-union employees.

139
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:51,336
[SPEAKER_04]: FY26 audit costs are projected to be increasing by that, by about 10,000.

140
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:56,559
[SPEAKER_04]: The cost for the admins program increased by 7% expenses.

141
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:06,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And also there was an advertising increase expense and the lease for the copier and a new printer for checks went up, so.

142
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:09,827
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't seem like anything that we don't need.

143
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:11,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing earth shattering.

144
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:19,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, the major part of the increase is obviously our contractual obligations and what we pay for admins and what we pay for the auditors.

145
00:34:21,054 --> 00:34:28,238
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't really, we tried to talk to the auditors and admins and definitely asked for that.

146
00:34:28,278 --> 00:34:35,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Courtney actually got a little bit of a break on the admins program, but those are the costs we're facing, so.

147
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:35,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

148
00:34:36,937 --> 00:34:42,062
[SPEAKER_04]: And just for anyone watching the audit is the independent audit that we do have all the city finances every year.

149
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:47,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And admins is the financial program we're currently using for city.

150
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:47,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

151
00:34:48,509 --> 00:34:48,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

152
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any questions on the finance and procurement budget.

153
00:34:53,054 --> 00:34:55,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, Thank you.

154
00:34:57,748 --> 00:34:58,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Dickinson for joining us.

155
00:34:59,669 --> 00:35:22,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I know oftentimes when we're here together, we talk about the need, how old our city's financial software is, and especially became an issue when you pointed it out when you came in, that the systems that we were using were not the systems that are commonplace throughout the state or are up to date.

156
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:26,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And that kind of slows down the workflow, makes things more difficult as well.

157
00:35:27,566 --> 00:35:45,762
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess my worry about the issue is more that I think we talk about the issue and then we kind of kick the can down the road about when exactly we might see that transition to a better financial system or a new financial system like a software.

158
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:47,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has these knock-on effects of

159
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:59,954
[SPEAKER_03]: affecting timeliness of financial reporting, it can affect calculation of retro pay, different payroll and finance updates as well.

160
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:11,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, is there any money in here, at least any seed money in here, to develop that timeline, that plan for updating our city's financial software?

161
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,079
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

162
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite frankly,

163
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:31,575
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is, right now, admins, though it's slow and clunky and somewhat difficult to use, it's what we've got and what everybody is used to.

164
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:38,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Transitioning to, there are ways to do that piecemeal, for instance, just updating the general ledger.

165
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:44,957
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have to make some improvements to how we work with the treasury.

166
00:36:44,977 --> 00:36:48,698
[SPEAKER_08]: The treasurer's cash book is on a program called SoftWrite.

167
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:59,875
[SPEAKER_08]: and we're gonna work on transitioning that to a cloud-based server, because the server for that needs to be replaced within the next year.

168
00:37:00,796 --> 00:37:13,341
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm looking into doing that, but we're talking to really change to a different software solution is gonna have to go in stages over many years, and it's gonna cost

169
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,410
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of money.

170
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're talking north of a million dollars.

171
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:29,434
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't, I mean, it's not something that we would discuss on my operating budget, really, that's something that put together a plan for doing and seeing how we can fund it.

172
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that answer.

173
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:54,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that helps explain a lot of it, but I think from this Councilor, what I would like to see going forward is us really think about what that transition looks like, even if it's spread over a period of time, because it would have, I think, long-term positive impacts for our city.

174
00:37:55,162 --> 00:38:01,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it would go nowhere if we don't at least start to formulate what that plan may look like.

175
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,487
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me speaking for myself.

176
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:10,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for saying when you say a north of a million dollars are we talking one time costs.

177
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:20,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd have to refine the numbers based on what I'm thinking would be the process.

178
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:28,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of it would be one-time costs in terms of actually purchasing the software.

179
00:38:29,953 --> 00:38:38,698
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just thinking about the one, the big one out there is Munis, but which I have gotten some quotations for the different modules and how much they would cost.

180
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:43,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Purchasing the software would be most of that.

181
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:52,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you would need to purchase their yearly support and software usage contract.

182
00:38:52,772 --> 00:38:55,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing that we have here with admins.

183
00:38:55,414 --> 00:38:57,557
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually more with Munis.

184
00:38:57,597 --> 00:38:58,518
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more costly.

185
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,361
[SPEAKER_08]: And then probably there would be

186
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:11,143
[SPEAKER_08]: a significant amount of money that we would need to have Munis Personal come in and train everybody to use the new software.

187
00:39:12,523 --> 00:39:18,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to give you an idea of the complexity of it, right now, the treasury uses SoftRight.

188
00:39:18,866 --> 00:39:21,668
[SPEAKER_08]: SoftRight will talk to Munis better than it will talk to admins.

189
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:30,633
[SPEAKER_08]: We would switch to the general ledger module for out of admins into Munis if we chose Munis.

190
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:38,437
[SPEAKER_08]: After that, we would probably move into switching over the treasury module.

191
00:39:38,957 --> 00:39:40,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Then after that, we'd move into

192
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,661
[SPEAKER_08]: buying the payroll module.

193
00:39:42,962 --> 00:39:53,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would get rid of SoftRite altogether and probably get rid of Harper's as the Harper's processes our payrolls.

194
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And we could have it all internal in one thing.

195
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:58,238
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, this is how complex it is.

196
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:00,541
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hundreds of thousands of dollars.

197
00:40:01,662 --> 00:40:03,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Up front, it's probably like a million dollars.

198
00:40:03,522 --> 00:40:12,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it's hundreds of thousands of dollars for the next several years as we gradually transition the entire system over to something like Munis.

199
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,725
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a big project.

200
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:18,026
[SPEAKER_08]: It would take a lot of resources.

201
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:28,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Beyond Munis, we'd probably need an outside consultant to work on the chart of accounts and to make sure all the systems worked correctly and everybody had what they needed.

202
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:42,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure at this point, we actually have the infrastructure in this building to run it, which I don't think was the case as little as two or three years ago.

203
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:46,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if we go to Munis, it's all going to be cloud-based.

204
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,715
[SPEAKER_08]: We need fiber optics everywhere to actually run the software.

205
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:52,097
[SPEAKER_08]: We need enough throughput to do it.

206
00:40:52,397 --> 00:40:55,300
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a big project.

207
00:40:56,936 --> 00:41:02,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe some good news I'm hearing is we've maybe laid some foundations to enable us to do the project.

208
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:16,011
[SPEAKER_04]: But it sounds like, to me, acquisition and training are one-time costs in the million to mid-million, $1 million range, maybe more than I'm seeing Nina point higher in the sky.

209
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite possible.

210
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:19,894
[SPEAKER_04]: The low single millions.

211
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:21,815
[SPEAKER_08]: The low single millions.

212
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:25,138
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I guess the only reason I'm doing that is because right now,

213
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:34,410
[SPEAKER_04]: From what you said, I'm drawn to the idea that we are paying an annual subscription costs for admins, SoftRight and Harper's right now.

214
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

215
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:43,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering if the combined annual cost of Munis, moving all of them eventually to Munis would eventually even out or maybe be lower.

216
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:46,658
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely wouldn't be lower.

217
00:41:46,778 --> 00:41:48,900
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably about the same, I would guess.

218
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:49,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

219
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:56,883
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll go to, I think I saw Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Lame, Councilor Callahan.

220
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:21,889
[SPEAKER_05]: How long would it take you to write up a one or two page document that essentially laid out the difference between keeping the software we have and moving to the new software, both in terms of like upfront costs, long term costs, like at what point we would sort of break even or begin to be saving money if we move to the new software, how much

221
00:42:22,649 --> 00:42:23,690
[SPEAKER_05]: work it would be?

222
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:31,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that you could put that into a one or two page document and would it be terribly burdensome for you?

223
00:42:32,297 --> 00:42:33,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

224
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:48,051
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really gotten into the gory details of it yet, but I don't think it would be that difficult to just outline how I see it working.

225
00:42:49,618 --> 00:43:00,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wonder if, because, you know, I hear all these names of different software is going around and then all this different amounts of money and, and I, I have trouble wrapping my head around it if it's not like written down.

226
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:15,151
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would really appreciate that I don't know if that's something that you know that Council feels is worth, worth the time of the staff time to like put together like a one page doc just of the basic outlines, but I would appreciate that.

227
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:31,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I would consider that a motion by Councilor Callahan to request that the finance director put together a one page document outlining the process to move to.

228
00:43:31,936 --> 00:43:36,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I am happy to make that motion unless anybody has in particular, before I begin making a motion.

229
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:40,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anybody who's like, no, don't do it, because I'm happy to make that motion.

230
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,341
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a second on the motion.

231
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,202
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Council Chief Steph.

232
00:43:47,677 --> 00:43:49,960
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a no for the record.

233
00:43:50,240 --> 00:44:03,817
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to share some of the considerations that Bob is confronted with at this point, because I think it should be stated here tonight, and you may know we have a vacancy in our budget manager, assistant finance director position.

234
00:44:04,357 --> 00:44:06,099
[SPEAKER_00]: We're presently trying to onboard that position.

235
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,581
[SPEAKER_00]: well, hire for that position and then onboard that position.

236
00:44:10,742 --> 00:44:15,985
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of deadlines and expectations between now and June 30th, right?

237
00:44:16,045 --> 00:44:26,029
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just saying all that to kind of lay out what the resource constraints might be on the immediate horizon.

238
00:44:26,049 --> 00:44:28,210
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know Bob goes into his busy season.

239
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,912
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to tee that up for Bob in case he has any other additional questions.

240
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:38,017
[SPEAKER_05]: perhaps I put a due date of July 31st to make it so it's not like during budget season.

241
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:40,539
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can finish budget season and then you know.

242
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:41,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always budget season in the fall.

243
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

244
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:43,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's helpful.

245
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:45,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm busy all the time.

246
00:44:46,104 --> 00:44:49,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometime this summer I could probably put that together.

247
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:57,693
[SPEAKER_08]: The other consideration is that you know when we talk about this everybody's heard of Munis, well not everybody's here.

248
00:44:58,414 --> 00:45:02,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Very few people have probably heard of Munis, but people who do my job have all heard of Munis.

249
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:06,559
[SPEAKER_08]: There are other software solutions out there for this.

250
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:16,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether or not that's another piece of this whole puzzle is we wouldn't just call up Tyler Technologies and say, hey, install Munis here.

251
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:18,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a million dollars.

252
00:45:20,206 --> 00:45:20,807
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to

253
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:31,558
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to investigate the other solutions and obviously have procurement take a look at it, just because we have to do our due diligence.

254
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:45,988
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're looking at putting together sort of an outline of what it would take, if you're not too concerned about the real gory details of how these systems work, that wouldn't take much time.

255
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:47,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can put it in my calendar to do

256
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:55,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Once we get the budget all passed, I've got my newest, hopefully, new assistant finance director working.

257
00:45:57,412 --> 00:45:57,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

258
00:45:58,232 --> 00:46:01,814
[SPEAKER_05]: In which case, I would love to make a kind of simple motion.

259
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:05,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to put a ton of details in because I think you understand what we're looking for.

260
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:19,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And the motion is that we request a document outlining what it would take for Medford to update our financial software.

261
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:21,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

262
00:46:22,395 --> 00:46:26,797
[SPEAKER_04]: And could we maybe request that by September... First?

263
00:46:27,758 --> 00:46:28,438
[SPEAKER_04]: First of the day?

264
00:46:28,718 --> 00:46:30,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the day I was going to say?

265
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:35,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say September 30th.

266
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:36,522
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine as well.

267
00:46:36,562 --> 00:46:36,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

268
00:46:36,902 --> 00:46:38,162
[SPEAKER_05]: By September, it doesn't matter.

269
00:46:38,202 --> 00:46:39,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's fine as long as it's this year.

270
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:43,058
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

271
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second on that motion?

272
00:46:46,063 --> 00:46:46,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Lazzaro?

273
00:46:48,386 --> 00:46:49,287
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

274
00:46:49,447 --> 00:46:49,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

275
00:46:50,128 --> 00:46:50,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

276
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:51,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

277
00:46:52,031 --> 00:46:53,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions, Councilor Kellogg?

278
00:46:53,392 --> 00:46:55,836
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll go to Councilor Leming.

279
00:46:58,385 --> 00:47:06,035
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had this question on my mind for a few minutes now, but conversation may have shed some light on that.

280
00:47:06,075 --> 00:47:07,076
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, I'm curious.

281
00:47:07,176 --> 00:47:14,885
[SPEAKER_07]: In your head, what do you see as the biggest barrier to actually updating the financial software?

282
00:47:17,108 --> 00:47:27,673
[SPEAKER_07]: The upfront cost, the actual troubleshooting with procuring and integrating the new system, or is it training staff to use something new?

283
00:47:27,713 --> 00:47:31,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it seemed like those are the three things that you were talking about just now.

284
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:40,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, which of those do you kind of dread when you think about doing this?

285
00:47:42,577 --> 00:47:46,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three, the training.

286
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:51,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, the upfront cost is a big number.

287
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,161
[SPEAKER_08]: How we get there, I don't personally know.

288
00:47:54,181 --> 00:48:00,263
[SPEAKER_08]: There's many different things in this city that need a million dollars, quite frankly.

289
00:48:02,774 --> 00:48:12,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Once that's done, then once you have the money together, then actually installing the software and doing that is done by, you know, it's done by professionals and consultants.

290
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:14,320
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a big deal.

291
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:21,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Making, you know, making sure it is a big deal, but it's something that wouldn't affect the day to day operations of the city.

292
00:48:24,024 --> 00:48:38,579
[SPEAKER_08]: they would install the software, they would make sure it actually does what it's supposed to do, they would make sure that it actually, that it can connect to SoftWrite correctly, so that we can get that aspect of it working.

293
00:48:40,201 --> 00:48:41,722
[SPEAKER_08]: And down the road, you know, if we

294
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:45,924
[SPEAKER_08]: move out of Harper's and move into the payroll module.

295
00:48:46,485 --> 00:48:50,466
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a whole, there's a bunch of different modules that Muniz has.

296
00:48:50,546 --> 00:48:53,427
[SPEAKER_08]: We would probably start with the general ledger and the AP module.

297
00:48:54,128 --> 00:48:56,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So, which is what admins does right now.

298
00:48:57,449 --> 00:49:00,370
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we gradually moved into the treasury module.

299
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:06,673
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a contract module, which makes procurement and that workflow much, much easier.

300
00:49:08,229 --> 00:49:28,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you have for the Treasury module that would include include, you know, real estate, personal property, boat excise tax, motor vehicle excise tax, that would have to connect to Kelly and Ryan, for instance, who, you know, goes after people who haven't paid their motor vehicle tax in a while.

301
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,601
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's all done by people who

302
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,031
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, they're trained, that's what they do.

303
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:40,693
[SPEAKER_08]: It's complicated, but we would be testing those systems and making sure they work.

304
00:49:41,213 --> 00:49:44,295
[SPEAKER_08]: That wouldn't affect the day-to-day operations of the city.

305
00:49:45,075 --> 00:49:57,580
[SPEAKER_08]: But once you get that and you make the switch over to a new software system, it's like, you know, you've been using Microsoft Excel all your life, and now you have to use some, you know, Google Docs.

306
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:01,462
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like you're not used to using this other system.

307
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:08,853
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of it works in similar ways, but not all of it.

308
00:50:09,694 --> 00:50:20,900
[SPEAKER_08]: So training everybody in the city who would need to make the transition, given that many people have been here for years and years and years using admins.

309
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,441
[SPEAKER_08]: They're used to what they do.

310
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:24,922
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be.

311
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:28,120
[SPEAKER_08]: long and complicated.

312
00:50:28,961 --> 00:50:41,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So in terms of timing of this, do you think that a better timeline would be maybe when there ends up being a lot of new people coming into your department who are more willing to learn new systems?

313
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:51,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm just trying to think when would the best time for this be if the biggest barrier is staff learning to do something new.

314
00:50:55,992 --> 00:51:00,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying not to get weedy on this, but the point is that admins is used across the city.

315
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:04,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Every department uses it in some way.

316
00:51:05,537 --> 00:51:15,681
[SPEAKER_08]: And to get the benefit of having a new integrated system means that people have to get used to how that would work.

317
00:51:16,662 --> 00:51:19,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm familiar with Munis because I used it in my prior position.

318
00:51:24,327 --> 00:51:29,750
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the advantages of it is, for instance, accounts payable workflow.

319
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:34,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody puts in a requisition that automatically goes to their department head.

320
00:51:34,752 --> 00:51:41,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Department head approves it, and it goes to finance to make sure that there's enough money there to pay for that.

321
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,216
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes to procurement if it's over a certain level.

322
00:51:44,536 --> 00:51:45,877
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all by email.

323
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:52,899
[SPEAKER_08]: But these are all, you know, there's the end user, then there's the department head, then there's finance, then there's procurement.

324
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:59,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And it goes to be made into a PO, so that's procurement again.

325
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:02,766
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is all done through workflow, it's all done through email.

326
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:06,008
[SPEAKER_08]: You just get an email, you click on it, you go, okay, this is...

327
00:52:07,128 --> 00:52:09,291
[SPEAKER_08]: this is what they're looking for, and you sign off on it.

328
00:52:09,931 --> 00:52:27,749
[SPEAKER_08]: But the bottom line is that everyone from the clerk in one department, through the department head, through all the other people who would have to sign off on that, they all have to learn how to do it with the system.

329
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:43,346
[SPEAKER_08]: So it affects, it's not just that if finance had a bunch of, I mean, I'm sure the people in finance who use admins all the time, I have no doubt that I can train them to use Munis fairly quickly.

330
00:52:44,446 --> 00:52:51,291
[SPEAKER_08]: But across all the departments in the school, all the departments in the city, there's a lot of people.

331
00:52:51,691 --> 00:52:56,554
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people involved who are suddenly gonna have to use a new system when we bite the bullet.

332
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:00,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And that could go really well.

333
00:53:00,819 --> 00:53:02,962
[SPEAKER_08]: It could take a lot of training.

334
00:53:05,064 --> 00:53:16,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think where I'm getting at is that I'm not getting the impression that there will ever be a particular period in time where that will not be a problem.

335
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:35,977
[SPEAKER_07]: So unless we plan to continue using the same system forever, if there were a case that doing it 10 years down the line would be an ideal time, would be a better time to actually make this switch, and that's one thing.

336
00:53:36,037 --> 00:53:47,023
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you don't think that, but if switching over is always going to be a difficult process, even though we'll have long-term benefits,

337
00:53:51,138 --> 00:53:51,438
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

338
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:54,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to belabor this too much.

339
00:53:56,562 --> 00:54:03,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I do a, you know, one 100th the size version of what you do in my day job.

340
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:14,634
[SPEAKER_04]: But essentially, what you're saying is we'd be this process is at the end of it, we would have had to reteach everyone who buys anything in the city how to buy something.

341
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:36,020
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure all the payroll stuff moves over smoothly and everyone who was paid by the city continues to be paid correctly, and also reteach not just people who work in the building, but also introduce residents to new ways to pay most of their taxes or fees to the city through the Treasury Department.

342
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:45,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I hadn't even gotten to the actual online payments and stuff.

343
00:54:45,912 --> 00:54:48,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Those systems would integrate with Munis.

344
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:56,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that I was involved in doing some of that for Nantucket.

345
00:54:57,217 --> 00:54:58,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it can do it.

346
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:04,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Setting it up is yet another aspect of this.

347
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:05,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

348
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:06,781
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

349
00:55:07,121 --> 00:55:08,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just put that out there.

350
00:55:09,477 --> 00:55:16,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with, I think, the spirit of the council, which is to say, there's no better time than soon to get started on this.

351
00:55:17,463 --> 00:55:37,238
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, I mean, essentially, we'd be talking for at least some period of time, we'd be paying for the new system, continuing to pay for the old system, probably running both systems in parallel, until we're sure that the new system is not going to fail out for an essential, you know, obviously, you can't miss a payroll run, right?

352
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:44,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand the scope and scale of what you're talking about, but I think this document is a good start.

353
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:54,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think soon after that, we should get into the nitty gritty of what does it look like in the CIP to pay for the one-time costs here?

354
00:55:55,834 --> 00:56:04,017
[SPEAKER_04]: How significantly, obviously, depending on bidding and what solution ends up being selected, are we talking about a huge,

355
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:09,253
[SPEAKER_04]: know, $250,000, $500,000, $750,000 impact on the operating budget?

356
00:56:09,273 --> 00:56:11,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we talking about like, 50 or 100,000?

357
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:26,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I do think that when we're talking about constantly being in a million dollar shortfall, when we're trying to make the budget every year, that would be impactful to me, you know, if we're talking about another million versus 100,000, that order of power, but

358
00:56:30,906 --> 00:56:32,327
[SPEAKER_04]: just appreciate you going through it.

359
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:38,028
[SPEAKER_04]: The only other thing I wanted to ask, you went through how an AP workflow would work with a new system.

360
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:39,509
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it look like now?

361
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:42,730
[SPEAKER_08]: It's mostly paper.

362
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:43,570
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

363
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:55,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's just the kind of hidden cost element of this, I think, is something that it might be worth noting or trying to note in the document you come up with over the next few months.

364
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:15,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's the one piece of this where I think there may be huge benefits in the sense that if we can get a system that's much more efficient, how many hours of work are we saving people in your office, but also all the people putting in POs and everyone working in treasury that could go to do something else?

365
00:57:15,816 --> 00:57:21,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not, you're not seeing it on the line item, but if a clerk is spending 10 hours a week

366
00:57:22,878 --> 00:57:28,360
[SPEAKER_04]: or 15 hours a week in a department doing mostly this, and under a new system, it'd be two to five hours a week.

367
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:33,241
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty significant financial impact on the city in the long run as well.

368
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:38,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that's hard to quantify, and I'm not asking you to quantify it, but I just think it's a part of the conversation.

369
00:57:39,383 --> 00:57:50,506
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal of this is not just maybe making it easier to put the city's financial, put the Munis module to show it on the website, it's also trying to make it so that the people in that building can

370
00:57:52,055 --> 00:57:58,279
[SPEAKER_04]: focus more time on other work rather than having to move paper back and forth to buy paper, for example.

371
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,683
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to comment on any of that, I don't want to not let you.

372
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:17,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, but it does give you an impression of how complicated it is to get all of this changed.

373
00:58:17,752 --> 00:58:19,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

374
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,115
[SPEAKER_08]: And we didn't even touch on

375
00:58:22,598 --> 00:58:27,003
[SPEAKER_08]: payroll when payroll would be completely electronic.

376
00:58:27,483 --> 00:58:40,536
[SPEAKER_08]: So departments would be entering payroll into Munis every week, and then that would flow straight into Treasury and straight into a file that goes off to the bank for electronic transactions.

377
00:58:41,737 --> 00:58:53,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It's again, that's you know, that would be in phase two or phase three of this project But you can imagine how complicated it would be to train everybody on how that actually works.

378
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:59,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah while making sure Everybody once a week gets their check.

379
00:58:59,627 --> 00:59:05,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so on the back end you're saving dozens and hundreds of hours But it's a huge amount of fun to get there.

380
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:08,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's a lot of upfront cost to this.

381
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:09,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I

382
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:13,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the discussion, appreciate you writing something up.

383
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:18,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And last thing, you know, I think, I still think this is important.

384
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:19,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think it's an issue.

385
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:38,026
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you first came on and a couple of years ago, when I would say there was less familiarity with the complexity of the systems that we have, you know, I hope you're here through however long you want to stay here and through us transitioning to new modules and a new financial system.

386
00:59:39,990 --> 01:00:07,195
[SPEAKER_04]: how are we doing on the, you know, what for lack of an artful term, I often in operations and finance work called the bus factor, which is if suddenly we did not have Bob Dickinson here, how are we able to transfer the knowledge that you have or the ability of someone to come in and say, I understand enough how these systems work that we can do a budget, do an audit, nevermind just running payroll and AP and stuff like that.

387
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,191
[SPEAKER_08]: mean with our existing system?

388
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:14,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah just if you know if let's assume you you move on or you retire or whatever.

389
01:00:14,993 --> 01:00:15,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I get hit by a bus.

390
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:19,995
[SPEAKER_04]: You hit the lottery let's let's make it positive we'll call it the lottery factor you know.

391
01:00:20,155 --> 01:00:20,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

392
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:22,116
[SPEAKER_04]: You hit the mega millions.

393
01:00:22,176 --> 01:00:23,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Kidnapped by aliens.

394
01:00:23,476 --> 01:00:28,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Kidnapped by aliens you know we could go any direction but you know and someone needs to come in and keep running the city.

395
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:34,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that was a tough that there was a lot of training that had to go into getting to understand how our old systems work and integrate so

396
01:00:38,533 --> 01:00:53,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, seeing as I don't have an assistance finance director, which is why we're working hard to get a new person in there and get them trained, it would be, I'll try not to get kidnapped by aliens in the next few weeks.

397
01:00:54,504 --> 01:01:04,911
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not, there's an awful lot of, there's an awful lot of stuff to know about it, but it's not like the city couldn't run

398
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:06,772
[SPEAKER_08]: without me.

399
01:01:09,394 --> 01:01:26,830
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just keeping up with everything and having the knowledge to know how things should be set up in terms of setting up the chart of accounts, setting up treasury codes, making sure that all these things actually flow correctly.

400
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:29,360
[SPEAKER_08]: making the journal entries for the audits.

401
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:38,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something that anybody, you know, when you went out to replace me, that person would have to know that kind of stuff.

402
01:01:38,226 --> 01:01:40,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Just that's in the nature of this position.

403
01:01:41,968 --> 01:01:56,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And then obviously, as happened when I was, during the interim before I was hired, you know, there's consulting firms that, you know, specifically have people who can step in and do this stuff.

404
01:01:57,633 --> 01:02:09,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it would take a while to get up to speed in how admins works and software it works and what what it would take to move it to Munis.

405
01:02:11,118 --> 01:02:13,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, or another software program.

406
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:14,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

407
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate that.

408
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:20,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, you know, I say it to kind of go towards counseling points, but also to note like,

409
01:02:23,483 --> 01:02:25,845
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people who have been using these systems a long time.

410
01:02:25,865 --> 01:02:27,547
[SPEAKER_04]: There are quirks in these systems.

411
01:02:27,587 --> 01:02:28,308
[SPEAKER_04]: There are probably...

412
01:02:29,564 --> 01:02:34,347
[SPEAKER_04]: little things that, you know, someone learned and now they know, you know, it makes things much faster, I would guess.

413
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:41,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, when they're looking something up, they have that institutional knowledge and experience.

414
01:02:41,411 --> 01:02:53,438
[SPEAKER_04]: That means that even though the system is clunky and complicated, once they learn, oh, soft write, if I click this button to connect it with admins this way, it's much easier than trying to look at Google it or whatever, you know.

415
01:02:55,279 --> 01:03:05,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, again, it's more work for an office it's overworked and you are the first department we're hearing from and I'm guessing that every department we hear from will be talking about under resourcing and being overworked.

416
01:03:06,566 --> 01:03:19,975
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think one of the reasons we, at least for me being on the council in the fiscal 23 budget process and, and, you know, what happened there, and that interim period between the CFO positions.

417
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:43,304
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the reasons I think, and Councilor Tseng being here too, and Councilor Collins, and I'm sure Councilor Scarpelli would say it as well, one of the reasons I think we're so intent and focused on this idea of moving to a new system is we saw what happened when the existing system didn't have the people with that institutional knowledge and they were learning that institutional knowledge on the job, trying to put together the budget.

418
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:47,667
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not certainly the process we have now, which I think is really great.

419
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:50,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm saying this mostly to be positive and say,

420
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:58,622
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, happy with how things are working and impressed at like, it's, it's never, there was a double entry or anything.

421
01:03:58,682 --> 01:04:02,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the system works, you get us the information, even though it's not the best system.

422
01:04:04,188 --> 01:04:32,861
[SPEAKER_04]: something if we're gonna be talking about like a three, five, six year timeline or more for transitioning to a new system that a Bob and Courtney's thoughts or a Bob Courtney and Judy's and Lisa's thoughts book of here's the workarounds that we found might be like something like an SOP around some of those kind of the quirkiness of our existing system might be worth having on hand just for the possibility of, you know,

423
01:04:34,598 --> 01:04:37,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just thinking back to that specific case that we experienced together.

424
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:45,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it, it has, it has occurred to me and there are definitely documents in place for some of that.

425
01:04:46,106 --> 01:04:48,427
[SPEAKER_08]: It hasn't, it's not formal.

426
01:04:49,308 --> 01:04:49,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

427
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:54,872
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah, no and I appreciate that and I think you know

428
01:04:55,647 --> 01:05:02,232
[SPEAKER_04]: even just collating those and saying, in case of a fire, break this glass, here's where the book is.

429
01:05:02,252 --> 01:05:07,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It could go, it would, you know, I never want to be in that budget again.

430
01:05:08,097 --> 01:05:10,178
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, you know, it's not great, but it's way better.

431
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,723
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, any further questions for finance and procurement?

432
01:05:19,546 --> 01:05:22,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, we will go to Council on Aging.

433
01:05:22,921 --> 01:05:23,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

434
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:34,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Pam, for sitting through and me kind of trying to end the council talking about financial and procurement systems.

435
01:05:36,168 --> 01:05:37,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just read really quickly.

436
01:05:37,248 --> 01:05:39,389
[SPEAKER_04]: We have fiscal 26 proposed personnel budget $264,064 and ordinary expenses $16,000.

437
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:41,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is an increase of about $3,000 or 1% from $277,157 to $280,064.

438
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:08,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like all the increases are in the salary and one office equipment.

439
01:06:08,897 --> 01:06:15,839
[SPEAKER_04]: So about $5,400 in COLAs, $20 increase in an office equipment contract.

440
01:06:15,979 --> 01:06:26,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like there was a reduction in some of the proposed budget for telephone and internet in the ordinary expenses.

441
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:29,681
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I'll go to you, Director Pam Kelly, Council on Aging.

442
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:31,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilors.

443
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:32,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having us tonight.

444
01:06:35,361 --> 01:06:49,607
[SPEAKER_06]: As Councilor Bears just mentioned, yes, there is a slight increase in the payroll portion of the four staff members that are on the payroll for the municipality, and that is due to the

445
01:06:52,176 --> 01:07:02,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, the non-COLA staff, and then obviously one union member staff increase.

446
01:07:04,427 --> 01:07:16,659
[SPEAKER_06]: The decrease in the telephone internet was due to the purchase for the citywide upgrade for the phones, and all of the bills were contracted under one

447
01:07:17,472 --> 01:07:21,175
[SPEAKER_06]: new department, the IT department I believe carries that now.

448
01:07:21,636 --> 01:07:23,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not that we don't have phones.

449
01:07:24,418 --> 01:07:27,541
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have the phones but we don't have to worry about the billing anymore.

450
01:07:32,326 --> 01:07:33,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any questions?

451
01:07:33,106 --> 01:07:35,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel free to add anything you want and then we'll go to questions.

452
01:07:36,467 --> 01:07:38,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

453
01:07:38,908 --> 01:07:40,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Our budget is really simple.

454
01:07:40,729 --> 01:07:44,530
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not too much included in that for the Council on Aging.

455
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:49,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's pretty much self-explanatory for what we have.

456
01:07:49,892 --> 01:07:51,493
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's any questions for me, please.

457
01:07:51,513 --> 01:07:55,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any questions for Pam, Council on Aging?

458
01:07:57,335 --> 01:07:58,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro.

459
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:00,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any questions.

460
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:01,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I just appreciate you being here.

461
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:04,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is pretty much flat funded as far as I'm concerned.

462
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:08,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wish we had more with the we could give you and improve your offerings.

463
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:10,952
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, you do a lot with what you have right now.

464
01:08:10,992 --> 01:08:11,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

465
01:08:11,472 --> 01:08:24,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you're you're really like overachieving with what you're given even now would be great for you to have more, hopefully someday soon.

466
01:08:26,395 --> 01:08:27,975
[SPEAKER_02]: But I appreciate your presentation.

467
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:31,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, thank you very much.

468
01:08:32,254 --> 01:08:33,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a comment and a question.

469
01:08:34,825 --> 01:08:44,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say thank you for working with members of the council, you know, the whole team over there, Suzanne and everyone else for setting up the listening sessions.

470
01:08:44,248 --> 01:08:53,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that several Councilors have been engaging more with the senior center in an official formal capacity, not just coming to events, but having those listening sessions.

471
01:08:53,911 --> 01:08:55,631
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really want to thank you for that.

472
01:08:55,871 --> 01:09:00,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really appreciate it because it's not easy for many of our participants to get here to City Hall.

473
01:09:01,533 --> 01:09:04,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So to have all of you come down once a month

474
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:08,216
[SPEAKER_06]: at different times, it's helpful, and they appreciate it.

475
01:09:09,176 --> 01:09:09,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

476
01:09:09,736 --> 01:09:10,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

477
01:09:10,137 --> 01:09:24,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my just my other question, I know, the general fund budget, you know, this budget pays for people, and the office supplies, basically, correct, but you get some other funds, could you tell us, you know, state and other grant funds than what that programming looks like?

478
01:09:24,624 --> 01:09:25,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

479
01:09:26,004 --> 01:09:29,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just recently had the CDBG budget.

480
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:31,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, it hasn't been

481
01:09:32,344 --> 01:09:44,635
[SPEAKER_06]: confirmed yet, but I will be getting hopefully $24,000, which helps for four different areas of extra programming and resources that we use.

482
01:09:45,076 --> 01:09:47,057
[SPEAKER_06]: The other budget that we get is from the state.

483
01:09:47,678 --> 01:09:53,323
[SPEAKER_06]: The state actually, for the entire senior center communities, there's 350.

484
01:09:55,325 --> 01:09:57,427
[SPEAKER_06]: You are based on your population.

485
01:09:58,087 --> 01:10:00,648
[SPEAKER_06]: seniors that are age 60 years of age and older.

486
01:10:01,088 --> 01:10:06,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So based on the 2020 federal census, the Medford has 12,766 seniors age 60 and older.

487
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:08,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are guaranteed a per adult

488
01:10:15,891 --> 01:10:17,052
[SPEAKER_06]: yearly rate.

489
01:10:17,572 --> 01:10:31,423
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this time, it's $15 per adult, and that fund is what we actually use for all of the exercise classes, all of the extras that are not covered in the municipal budget.

490
01:10:32,664 --> 01:10:42,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So our driver for our van, some of our events, Mystic Valley Elder Services, Title III match, some of the

491
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:53,116
[SPEAKER_06]: things that might fall in between the gap that doesn't get completely covered by the municipal budget.

492
01:10:55,478 --> 01:10:56,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

493
01:10:56,118 --> 01:11:04,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I just think the other great thing about this process, and there's so much context, this is the city budget.

494
01:11:04,826 --> 01:11:05,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

495
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:10,210
[SPEAKER_04]: But the city budget isn't actually all the money that city departments spend on the things that they do.

496
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:12,572
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, for example, you know, it's almost

497
01:11:13,373 --> 01:11:14,834
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, another hundred something, almost $200,000.

498
01:11:14,874 --> 01:11:15,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

499
01:11:15,494 --> 01:11:15,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

500
01:11:16,275 --> 01:11:20,398
[SPEAKER_04]: That you use for all the other programs that absolutely our seniors love.

501
01:11:20,498 --> 01:11:28,123
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just think, you know, as much as we can talk about reminding everyone, you know, this, you might see this piece of paper and say, well, what are we doing?

502
01:11:28,143 --> 01:11:30,625
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer is it's coming from somewhere else.

503
01:11:31,085 --> 01:11:31,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

504
01:11:31,565 --> 01:11:32,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Other areas.

505
01:11:32,646 --> 01:11:34,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also do a lot of grant writing.

506
01:11:34,988 --> 01:11:35,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

507
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:36,969
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very helpful.

508
01:11:37,849 --> 01:11:38,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

509
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:39,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much.

510
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:40,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing no further questions.

511
01:11:40,831 --> 01:11:42,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any motions?

512
01:11:45,643 --> 01:11:47,384
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you, Director Kelly.

513
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:48,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

514
01:11:49,925 --> 01:11:53,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That was our two departments and our overview for today for the Committee of the Whole meeting.

515
01:11:54,488 --> 01:11:57,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any further discussion or is there a motion?

516
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:06,274
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion to keep the paperwork in committee, refer out the motions and questions, and adjourn.

517
01:12:06,294 --> 01:12:10,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we had any.

518
01:12:11,816 --> 01:12:12,897
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the motion from Councilor.

519
01:12:18,327 --> 01:12:19,929
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from Councilor Tseng, seconded by.

520
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:21,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

521
01:12:21,652 --> 01:12:22,373
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favour?

522
01:12:23,094 --> 01:12:23,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

523
01:12:23,435 --> 01:12:24,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

524
01:12:24,276 --> 01:12:25,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting is adjourned.

525
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:29,504
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be in regular meeting in just a minute for seven, a little after seven o'clock.

526
01:12:29,784 --> 01:12:29,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
