00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know.

25
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,460
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a lot.

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,302
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the only Friday night game.

27
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:04,403
[SPEAKER_06]: All the other games are Saturday afternoon.

28
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:14,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're just afraid of the problems that happen on Friday nights.

29
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:17,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually we'll get the huge wave of marijuana.

30
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,594
[SPEAKER_06]: From the kids beeping.

31
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:29,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Happens every year.

00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:50,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.

33
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:01,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

34
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:28,858
[SPEAKER_06]: They usually put up a good fight.

35
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Brockton's having a hard time scoring.

36
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:36,021
Ladies and gentlemen,

37
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:55,618
[SPEAKER_06]: We ask that you bring your attention to midfield as we begin our pregame ceremony.

38
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:15,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Last summer, our community lost Makai and Terry Boston in a tragic accident.

39
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:21,648
[SPEAKER_06]: The Boston brothers exemplify what it meant to be a Brockton boxer.

40
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:29,289
[SPEAKER_06]: They were dedicated, hardworking, driven, talented, and boxer tough.

41
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:35,710
[SPEAKER_06]: They also had smiles that could light up a room, even on the darkest of days.

42
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:44,532
[SPEAKER_06]: As we gather here tonight, we want to let the Boston family know that Makai and Terry will never be forgotten.

43
00:08:46,095 --> 00:08:47,716
[SPEAKER_06]: They will be in our hearts forever.

44
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:58,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though their time with us was cut short, we are grateful to have been their teammates, friends, teachers, and coaches.

45
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:08,986
[SPEAKER_06]: It is our honor to give the Boston family jersey number 75 as we celebrate the lives of Makai and Terry.

46
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:10,307
[SPEAKER_06]: God bless.

47
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:39,212
[SPEAKER_06]: At this time, we ask that you please rise, remove your hats, and direct your attention to the flag as we honor America with the playing of our national anthem by the Brockton High School Marching Band.

48
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:22,578
I'm sorry.

49
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:53,529
you

50
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Rocky Marciano Stadium in the campus of Brockton High School.

51
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:22,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, 2024, Brockton Community Access to the Brockton Channels.

52
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Opening game for us on the air.

53
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:29,625
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boxers take on the Lincoln-Subbury Warriors.

54
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:33,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo Genitasio, along with the Brockton legend, Orlando Galvao.

55
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:35,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Orlando, the Boxers come in tonight, 0-2.

56
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:48,381
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people, we've talked about this earlier in the season, they had that opening game at Bounstable where they came in, it looked like they had the game won, they had to take a couple knees, they threw the football, they lost.

57
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,663
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people around the city talking about the game.

58
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,451
[SPEAKER_00]: They came back the next week against Franklin.

59
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:58,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, after the first half, Brockton kind of fell apart in the second half and Franklin ran away with the game.

60
00:11:58,993 --> 00:12:00,414
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you seen early from the Boxers?

61
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:06,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, two things that have stuck out early in the season are obviously what you just said, decision making and a lot of penalties.

62
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:34,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton 10 penalties about 10 penalties the first game 10 penalties The second game including touchdowns called back you can't win that you can't win football games that way right and then I'm going back to the first game right you take three knees you get out of Bonstable with a victory and they elected to pass possible ran it back to our 18 and was able to cash in like good teams do and Give Brockton a heartbreaking loss in that first game, and I'm did it go on to the second game where?

63
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:35,779
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have lingered

64
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:42,040
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a short break here and go on to the field.

65
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:17,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Hate to see that.

66
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:24,805
[SPEAKER_00]: As the captains go over the flipping of the coin, going into Lincoln-Subury, they come into the season 0-2.

67
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:28,668
[SPEAKER_00]: How have they fared early in the season, Orlando, against the competition they faced?

68
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:31,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they played two tough teams and, you know,

69
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:38,053
[SPEAKER_01]: They've both been blogs, but let's go back to the two two meetings against Brockton the Lincoln suburb, right?

70
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:45,616
[SPEAKER_01]: two years ago Brockton had a big lead and Lincoln Sudbury came crashing back and Almost pulled that game off Brockton won an overtime, correct?

71
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:53,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they did go on overtime or it would I know Lincoln Sudbury made a game of it last year overtime

72
00:13:54,557 --> 00:14:04,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton took him into overtime, so I expect nothing but another close game, and obviously Brockton is playing with emotion tonight, right?

73
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:10,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Their first game of the year, they're back here in Brockton, they're 0-2, and they're probably playing for their brother, Makai Boston.

74
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:12,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go over the Lincoln-Subbury starters.

75
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:23,053
[SPEAKER_00]: On offense, their best player, their all-around player, Shavon Harris, a wide receiver junior, running back will be Matt Tasker, a junior.

76
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan Gallagher, a junior, a wide receiver.

77
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:28,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan Cushin, the wide receiver, a junior.

78
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:33,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Also another good all-around athlete, Dom Tocanto, a wide receiver.

79
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:36,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean Landry, one of the other running backs they go to.

80
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:39,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Their offensive line, a mixture of three seniors and two juniors.

81
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:41,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Aber at right guard.

82
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:44,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Ferreira at left guard.

83
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:47,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Emmitt Dolan at center.

84
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:49,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Gordon at left tackle.

85
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:52,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Max Krauser, the big right tackle, also a senior.

86
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:59,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go further, let's not forget also Terry Boston.

87
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:02,503
[SPEAKER_00]: The younger brother, just about to be a part of the football program.

88
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:04,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just a tragedy.

89
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:11,508
[SPEAKER_00]: They were wonderful kids and a nice thing by the whole Brockton community to honor the boys tonight.

90
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:17,270
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boxers Orlando come in, scoring two touchdowns early in the season.

91
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,391
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a young quarterback.

92
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,283
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all-purpose running back Luke Turco.

93
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:24,523
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we looking at offensively for the Boxers?

94
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:30,545
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because Brockton has scored in their first possessions of each game and then haven't been able to score the rest of the game.

95
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:36,126
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first drives of the game has been good, but going further, you know, a lot of penalties.

96
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:38,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're looking for the same.

97
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:40,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke Turco to get the ball a lot.

98
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,008
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes around him.

99
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:44,988
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers have won the toss.

100
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:45,508
[SPEAKER_00]: They deferred.

101
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,629
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be kicking off to the south end of the end zone.

102
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,588
[SPEAKER_00]: The boxer kicker tonight will be number 16.

103
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:55,885
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is Daniel DaSilva.

104
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:59,607
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ball goes deep to about the 10 yard line where Lincoln Subway will return it.

105
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:00,507
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a little space.

106
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:02,668
[SPEAKER_00]: He has some room and he cuts up over the field.

107
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:05,849
[SPEAKER_00]: He cuts back and he has a lot of open space there.

108
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:11,111
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a terrific return and they will cash it in about the box of 38 yard line.

109
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:12,392
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of missed tackles there, Orlando.

110
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:23,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just like last week, this time Brockton able to catch him, avoiding the return, but not a good start for Brockton here at Rocky Marciano Stadium.

111
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,357
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln Submarine comes out.

112
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:31,663
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boxers will have to make a big stand early in this football game in their own side.

113
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:39,050
[SPEAKER_00]: The quarterback for Lincoln Submarine will be number 15, Sean Landry.

114
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:46,457
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boxers look like they're coming out in that 43 defense with two safeties back with Luke Turco and Jared Mighty.

115
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:49,474
[SPEAKER_00]: possible osculastic safety back there.

116
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:54,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I talked to the Lincoln-Subbury coach, Justin McKay, very young team this year for Lincoln-Subbury.

117
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,005
[SPEAKER_00]: So Landry gets the ball and the pistol and we get a penalty right away that might be an illegal procedure.

118
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:01,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln-Subbury's gonna go back five yards.

119
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:06,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, after a good return, you don't wanna start offensive series that way.

120
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:08,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna back you up five yards here.

121
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,700
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will put the ball back to the 43 for a first and 15.

122
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,041
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about the Brockton secondary.

123
00:17:14,602 --> 00:17:18,023
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the better safety tandems in the state in Luke Turkle and Jared Michaels.

124
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke Turkle, very special.

125
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:20,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me some Luke Turkle.

126
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:23,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be saying that a lot tonight.

127
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:28,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton returns a lot of veterans on defense, including Jaden Lopes-Ribeiro, a corner.

128
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Karens Antoine, a corner.

129
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Ahmad Wiggins in the middle.

130
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:36,004
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the pistol they remain, first and 15.

131
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not see Ahmad Wiggins out there right now.

132
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:45,272
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an inside handoff, a little bit of space, and Brockton closes that up pretty well for a modest two yard game.

133
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:47,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we gotta get a update on that.

134
00:17:47,873 --> 00:17:56,277
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not see him, I know Ahmad went limping off the field last week against Franklin, and I do not see him out there right now.

135
00:17:56,297 --> 00:17:57,418
[SPEAKER_00]: I see number five.

136
00:17:57,518 --> 00:18:07,523
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the senior Jalen Jackson, a three year starter on the tackle, with a little help from number 88 for the boxers, Nathan Jean-Philippe, the senior defensive end.

137
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:17,591
[SPEAKER_00]: So at second in vote, 13, Lincoln-Subber remains in the pistol with one back next to the QB.

138
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:22,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Same play, hand off and there's nothing going there.

139
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:24,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrific standby boxes.

140
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:30,123
[SPEAKER_00]: and the tackle by number 70 for Brockton, who's in the backfield, Jaden Seal, the senior.

141
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:38,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Running back gets the ball, boxer right in his face to take him down, and two plays, and Lincoln Sudbury going backwards.

142
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:45,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaden Seal, unfortunately, was injured last year, but Brockton expects him to be one of their better two-way linemen.

143
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:47,268
[SPEAKER_00]: He's very athletic, got good feet.

144
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:50,149
[SPEAKER_00]: So about third and 16 with the loss of two.

145
00:18:50,469 --> 00:18:51,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Lincoln Sudbury has here.

146
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,851
[SPEAKER_00]: They have athleticism at the wide receiver position.

147
00:18:56,932 --> 00:18:59,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I just gotta report my Wiggins not playing tonight.

148
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:03,216
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quarterback will remain in the pistol.

149
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:03,856
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes back.

150
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:04,257
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks.

151
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:05,137
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a man over the middle.

152
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:07,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a terrific throw and it's intercepted.

153
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,920
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Karens Antoine on the tip.

154
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,640
[SPEAKER_00]: He cuts it back.

155
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,281
[SPEAKER_00]: He has room on the right side.

156
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,983
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going backwards and he will go down.

157
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:20,006
[SPEAKER_00]: So an unspeakable start for Lincoln Sudbury on offense.

158
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:21,566
[SPEAKER_00]: The tip drill.

159
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:24,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Antoine ready for it.

160
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,472
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get to interception and Brockton takes it over.

161
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:31,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Great play.

162
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:36,958
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boxers will come out on offense and what do we think of this young quarterback so far this year?

163
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Cimetto, man, I like this.

164
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I think his future is bright.

165
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:42,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously there's going to be some learning curves.

166
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:45,825
[SPEAKER_01]: So baby steps and we'll see what happens tonight.

167
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:47,526
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do like Mr. Cimetto.

168
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:52,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey Rhodes, the junior, will be in the backfield next to him with the three wide receivers, two to the left.

169
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Samedo gets the naming ball, goes to Rhodes.

170
00:19:57,076 --> 00:20:00,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhodes has a little room, nice cut up inside for a modest three yard gain.

171
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Rhodes is a little shifty there.

172
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,100
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes to do that.

173
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,663
[SPEAKER_01]: You think he's gonna go right and he slashes it in real quick and picks up about four yards.

174
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:11,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Good vision right there as Brockton's gonna move fast.

175
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:13,285
[SPEAKER_00]: K.C.

176
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhodes remains in the backfield.

177
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:17,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Two receivers to the right of Samedo this time, one to the left.

178
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:21,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Lopes-Ribera, I think one would be Jayden Wooten.

179
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:30,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Samedo back to pass, the ball goes again and he's got nothing there.

180
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:32,588
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes down and that will be a loss or two.

181
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:38,330
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at a third down and eight as a good penetration right there by the linebacker from 51.

182
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's Devon Harrison, our coach mentioned him at the beginning of the game.

183
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:46,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Linebacker, go both ways, very special player.

184
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:47,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Coach really high on him.

185
00:20:48,492 --> 00:20:50,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kevin Abad was in there also, number 51.

186
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:53,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Good looking middle linebacker.

187
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:57,156
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers will have third and eight at their own 29 yard line.

188
00:20:57,216 --> 00:21:03,637
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna go three rides of receivers to the left of Samedo, and the lone back will be Casey Rhodes again.

189
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:11,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Subber remains in that 44 front with no real safety on the board.

190
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,059
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be a hitch pass.

191
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,060
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes over to number one.

192
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,380
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a little room, he's got space, and that's gonna be a first down.

193
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job, Lopes.

194
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Way to follow your blocks.

195
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:20,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut it inside.

196
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,394
[SPEAKER_01]: picked up about 13 yards and that's good for a Brockton first down.

197
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:31,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice cut by Jadon Los Ribeiro, didn't panic, saw the space, took it and got the first down.

198
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,364
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boxers are gonna move fast with double receivers to both sides.

199
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:39,629
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball goes to Casey Rhodes and once again, he breaks a tackle.

200
00:21:40,911 --> 00:21:49,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that play's gonna look like it's taken long to develop, snap included, and then that's able to give the linemen a chance to get Rhodes there.

201
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:56,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Hebert once again in the backfield, real athletic linebacker, and the Brockton offensive line's gonna have to make some adjustments there.

202
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:58,870
[SPEAKER_00]: They're massive up front this year.

203
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Play callin' comin' in by Coach Barrows.

204
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:06,638
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll see two wide receivers to the left with the H back, Luke Turco in the game.

205
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:10,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo again in the pistol, and the ball's gonna go right to Turco.

206
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:19,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco tries to get outside, there's not a lot of room over there, he cuts it up inside, and he gains about four yards, and nice game tackling by Lincoln Sudbury.

207
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:26,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Luke Turco should've been tackled in the back for a loss, but that's what he does, he never loses yards, he's always going forward.

208
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:35,257
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a direct snap to Turco, Samedo had his hands in there, maybe it slowed the play down a half a second, which allowed Lincoln Sudbury to get in on the ball.

209
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:42,201
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers will be looking at a third and seven, the last time a third and long they converted on a screen pass to Lopes Ribeiro.

210
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:50,446
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see number four for the Boxers, Jadon Wooten the senior, along with Lopes Ribeiro, and I believe that is number two Antoine Haught.

211
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting play, the last play, I don't know.

212
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:57,505
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's gonna be a misplay, I don't think.

213
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:59,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he wasn't ready for the ball.

214
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:02,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Was not ready for the ball, again.

215
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:04,870
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't panic though, Semedo, he gained three yards on the play.

216
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:09,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that a lot with the snapper and the quarterback, not on the same page, three games into the season.

217
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:14,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton faces a big decision here at midfield, and it looks like they're saying stay out there.

218
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,000
[SPEAKER_00]: So fourth and four, the Boxers keep the offense on the field.

219
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,181
[SPEAKER_00]: We're under seven minutes in the first quarter of a scoreless game.

220
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:27,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocky Marciano Stadium, Leo Genitasio, along with the legend, Orlando Galvao.

221
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:32,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's not forget Sylvia's first home game as a Brockton Boxer.

222
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:33,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to him.

223
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:36,109
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Boxers will go for it.

224
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,852
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap, he's got a little bit of time, a little bit of space.

225
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:43,973
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks over, that's a tough play.

226
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,663
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's just a difficult throw to make.

227
00:23:50,703 --> 00:23:57,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were looking for something easier over the middle, but Lincoln-Subbury defended it well, and Brockton's gonna give the ball back at midfield to Lincoln-Subbury.

228
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you look at that, they're looking for a pass and finish.

229
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:05,249
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a great play by the Lincoln-Subbury defender, and like you said, Leo, that had no chance.

230
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:11,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the interceptions, the Boxers gained one first down, and the ball's turned over and down to about the box of 49 yard line.

231
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:14,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln-Subbury will send back out their offense.

232
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:22,933
[SPEAKER_00]: as the box's defense was really physical in that first drive, didn't allow much on the ground and intercepted the ball.

233
00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:29,785
[SPEAKER_01]: The Conservative starts again in a great field position across the 50 yard line.

234
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:32,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean Landry remains in the pistol.

235
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:34,835
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got three receivers to the right and the lone back.

236
00:24:35,555 --> 00:24:38,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pitch goes, he has a little bit of space over there.

237
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:43,918
[SPEAKER_00]: A good run, that's gonna gain about four yards before the game tackle over to the right there, led by Luke Turco.

238
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:50,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, early in the year, that play, defensively, as Brockton has not adjusted to that sweep play.

239
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:51,482
[SPEAKER_01]: It's giving him trouble.

240
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:58,305
[SPEAKER_01]: It's giving him trouble, and it's that exact direction that teams keep on running on Brockton, and they gain about five yards.

241
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:04,730
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go second and about five, maybe a short six.

242
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,753
[SPEAKER_00]: As the boxers remain in that, look like they're 44 front.

243
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:16,458
[SPEAKER_00]: As Landrieu remained the pistol with two receivers to his right, one to his left, one back with an H back.

244
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:25,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a snap, and they're gonna run it again, he has more space to the right, he's gonna get outside, he's gonna gain a first down.

245
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:28,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Same place, we got a flag here, that's gonna be a hold in, that's gonna come back.

246
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:37,809
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was some space on the same side there for the eight yard run, but it looks like it's gonna be called back with a hold, we'll wait for the call, it came from the field judge in the back.

247
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:43,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a clear hold, I saw that as it developed, so that will cost Lincoln Sudbury 10 yards.

248
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:50,034
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will take the first down away from the Warriors and move them back 10 yards.

249
00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:54,356
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be the ball was marked right around the first down marker.

250
00:25:54,376 --> 00:26:01,760
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at about a second and nine as Lincoln-Suburys found something over there, it landed on their right side, running at the Boxers.

251
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:07,603
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the side I was talking about and until you stop it, teams are gonna keep going that direction.

252
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:11,165
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at five minutes, 24 seconds of the first quarter, scoreless.

253
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,091
[SPEAKER_01]: big, good crowd here in Brockton tonight.

254
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:17,431
[SPEAKER_01]: What a beautiful night as well.

255
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:20,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean Landry remains in the pistol.

256
00:26:21,092 --> 00:26:24,793
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got trips to the right, trips to the left, one to the right with a single back.

257
00:26:24,853 --> 00:26:27,874
[SPEAKER_00]: He's down, he's back, he looks, he's got space over there, it's a great throw.

258
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:30,015
[SPEAKER_00]: And a catch for a first down.

259
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:33,195
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna gain about 10 yards for the first down.

260
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a quick tackle there by Turco.

261
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:38,897
[SPEAKER_00]: As it was a nice precision play.

262
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:45,409
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing to a spot, and they'll get a first down around the Boxer, 36 yard line.

263
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:50,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, DeCanto with a good route, good catch, took the hit, great pass, and they move the sticks.

264
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:58,440
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln Sudbury, deep inside the Boxer's territory here.

265
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,523
[SPEAKER_00]: They remain in the pistol, two to the right, one to the left, H back, and one back.

266
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the snap and it's gonna be a handoff.

267
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:08,703
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of room there.

268
00:27:08,723 --> 00:27:10,724
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good run, he kept moving his legs.

269
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:14,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like they're gonna gain six.

270
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:15,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like they had him in the backfield, Lando.

271
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:16,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Right near him.

272
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:17,711
[SPEAKER_01]: He just kept on pushing and pushing.

273
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:19,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Good gain there on first down.

274
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:27,520
[SPEAKER_00]: So second and five around the 31 yard line as Lincoln Subberry continues to drive.

275
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:33,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Box is missing Ahmad Wiggins, a three-year starter at linebacker.

276
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:34,189
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge loss.

277
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:42,481
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing Ty Baker, the senior in the middle, along with number five, Jordan DiPina, the senior.

278
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:43,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the pistol.

279
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:51,196
[SPEAKER_00]: second and a long four, there's the run, he's got a little bit of space, he's got space, that's a big tackle right there.

280
00:27:52,917 --> 00:28:00,642
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was about to break that tackle, Luke comes up from the safety position and wraps him up, great form tackling for really no gain.

281
00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:05,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke Turco's like a safety and a linebacker all at once.

282
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:08,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Orlando, there's not a lot of safeties in the state better than him.

283
00:28:08,237 --> 00:28:10,817
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really terrific football player.

284
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:13,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to his father, Greg, before the game.

285
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:14,038
[SPEAKER_00]: He was looking at Fordham.

286
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:18,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Any school that gets Luke at a safety position is gonna have himself a real football player.

287
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,120
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very, very true.

288
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a lot of people that said the same thing.

289
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:25,101
[SPEAKER_01]: They love Luke Turco.

290
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:28,082
[SPEAKER_00]: So third and four from the 31.

291
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:30,623
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton jumps and they're gonna give him a free first down.

292
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:37,428
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about it before the game, just penalties.

293
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:38,688
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not good enough.

294
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:43,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's gonna drive Coach, it drove Coach Jermaine Wiggins crazy last year.

295
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:47,852
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't win football games with nine, 10 penalties a game.

296
00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:48,913
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first one tonight.

297
00:28:50,213 --> 00:28:55,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Warriors get a first down around the 26 yard line, as Brockton forced a third down.

298
00:28:56,616 --> 00:28:59,617
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't make it easy for your opponents, because it's gonna make it harder for you.

299
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:04,237
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see, they remain in that pistol.

300
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:07,497
[SPEAKER_00]: They've just been flip-flopping the receivers from each one side to another.

301
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:11,558
[SPEAKER_00]: They got three to the left, one to the right, one to the H-back, and we're gonna get a timeout.

302
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:20,000
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is Leo Genitasio, along with the legend Orlando Galvao, Brockton Community Access.

303
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,680
[SPEAKER_00]: You can catch us on the Brockton channels.

304
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:28,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we got Mike the Postman Simmons on the production, Curtis Reese, and Scott Labossiere on the cameras and production.

305
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:33,528
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our new camera here, our new monitor here, Orlando.

306
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:34,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't beat this.

307
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:37,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel like I'm in the ESPN.

308
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel like we're doing a big time game.

309
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:43,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a great crowd here tonight at Marciano Stadium.

310
00:29:43,252 --> 00:29:45,433
[SPEAKER_00]: The boxer side almost full.

311
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Here to root on the 2024 boxers.

312
00:29:52,496 --> 00:29:54,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Defensive coordinator John Shelby.

313
00:29:55,304 --> 00:30:04,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure talking about gap discipline, tackling, stuff that all defensive coordinators, you know, talk about with their linebackers and ends.

314
00:30:05,231 --> 00:30:07,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to do too much, do your job.

315
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:11,455
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln Submarine comes right up for the time out to the line of scrimmage.

316
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:18,140
[SPEAKER_00]: They are gonna, looks like they're under center for the first time tonight.

317
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:24,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Well one back and looks like an H back and a tight end to the right.

318
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:28,189
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a man in motion, there's the box.

319
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:37,296
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot, a little bit of room there, and he'll gain a modest three yards, as it was a good push from the left side right there of Lincoln Sudbury, and a tackle from the boxers.

320
00:30:37,316 --> 00:30:41,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like it was Ty Baker, and we got an injury for Lincoln Sudbury.

321
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,640
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unfortunate.

322
00:30:43,621 --> 00:30:45,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just a cramp, hopefully.

323
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:47,264
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's number one.

324
00:30:47,384 --> 00:30:48,285
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like it's number 52.

325
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:58,779
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Adam Ferreira, one of their captains in left guard.

326
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:02,641
[SPEAKER_00]: And he scores on the out of town docket tonight, Orlando.

327
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at the Everett BC High.

328
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,883
[SPEAKER_01]: BC High's up 32 to seven at half.

329
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:11,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they can't be happy up there in E country.

330
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:15,226
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about Brockton football tradition, Everett.

331
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:20,470
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last 30 years has been everything Brockton was before Everett came in, so.

332
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:26,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Brockton plays Everett this year, so it's the battle of the one and two programs historically.

333
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,117
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be a good one no matter what.

334
00:31:28,357 --> 00:31:29,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's one and who's two, Orlando?

335
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:34,342
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends who you ask.

336
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:35,603
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on where you are.

337
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:37,825
[SPEAKER_01]: In Everett, Everett's number one.

338
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:42,449
[SPEAKER_01]: You ask people in Brockton, Brockton's gonna say two, but if you ask a neutral person, they'll probably say Everett.

339
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't agree with you.

340
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:47,415
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an argument for another day.

341
00:31:49,477 --> 00:31:51,360
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're looking at Farada down.

342
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton has time to go over the sidelines and talk over what they're gonna do defensively.

343
00:31:56,318 --> 00:31:58,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the blockers come in tonight 0-2.

344
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach Jilson Silver, a young coach, his first year as a head coach.

345
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:06,747
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually never been a coordinator before, but he's been around Brockton football.

346
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:07,527
[SPEAKER_00]: He played here.

347
00:32:07,547 --> 00:32:10,830
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my son play for him on the freshman team.

348
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,711
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a disciplinarian coach.

349
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:14,173
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't put up with a lot of stuff.

350
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:16,515
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's exactly what Brockton needs.

351
00:32:16,555 --> 00:32:22,039
[SPEAKER_00]: He's surrounded himself with guys he trusts, guys that play Brockton football, and we're not gonna judge him on two games, obviously.

352
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:27,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Midfield decision.

353
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,707
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gutsy call.

354
00:32:28,807 --> 00:32:30,769
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gutsy call, but you know.

355
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:31,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, yeah.

356
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:33,974
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's a young coach.

357
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:38,801
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he learned his lesson after the basketball game that you're never gonna throw again in a knee situation.

358
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:42,926
[SPEAKER_00]: There's times in a football game where he's gonna be challenged to make decisions.

359
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:48,011
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to be aggressive early in the game, put a little confidence in his young quarterback.

360
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:58,516
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at about second and seven from the 23 yard line of Brockton, Lincoln-Subbury in a 0-0 game in the pistol.

361
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:04,859
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap, and there's a little bit of room to the outside, Brockton trying to close that.

362
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:07,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is closed down really fast.

363
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,390
[SPEAKER_01]: saying I had enough of that.

364
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:15,632
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to go again, sweep right, and this time Brockton was able to make the play.

365
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:23,175
[SPEAKER_00]: DePener along with Jared Mighty, the junior safety, who's getting a ton of college looks right now, not only for football, for track.

366
00:33:23,975 --> 00:33:27,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrific student, football player, Brockton's lucky to have him.

367
00:33:27,937 --> 00:33:34,679
[SPEAKER_00]: So a loss of five there will make it third and about 11 from the 27 yard line.

368
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,160
[SPEAKER_00]: The last,

369
00:33:38,152 --> 00:33:41,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Third and long, Everett Lincoln-Subbury completed on a pass.

370
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:51,855
[SPEAKER_00]: So Landry, from the pistol, he has a little bit of time, time, he looks, he looks over the middle, he has a man open, and that's gonna be a touchdown.

371
00:33:52,355 --> 00:33:53,456
[SPEAKER_00]: A terrific throw.

372
00:33:54,536 --> 00:33:59,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrific throw, terrific route, and I don't know about the defensively.

373
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we talked about this last year, Karens Antoine peeking in the backfield.

374
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:17,226
[SPEAKER_00]: He got beat by two steps, and Landry put it right where it was supposed to be, and Lincoln Sudbury on a third and long completes the pass for a six-nothing lead, and they'll send in their kicker to make it seven-nothing at around the one-minute mark of the first quarter.

375
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:18,847
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a pitch and catch, simple.

376
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:22,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as a cornerback, you have to cover that.

377
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:24,110
[SPEAKER_00]: We're watching it right here, Orlando.

378
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:36,014
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looked like he had him at the line of scrimmage, and as the wide receiver made his move, he peeked a little bit in the backfield to see where the play was going, and he went right by him.

379
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:40,115
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the extra point attempt, and the kick is gonna be good.

380
00:34:41,736 --> 00:34:48,637
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the 138 mark, here at Rocky Marciano Stadium, Lincoln-Subbury 7, the Brockton Box is 0.

381
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:52,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the energy level, I don't feel like it's there yet.

382
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:55,199
[SPEAKER_01]: And you figure in a game of this magnitude,

383
00:34:57,434 --> 00:35:00,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockford would be more up for so far, I mean we're still early.

384
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:04,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's something we talked about last year with Coach Wiggins, but he had a young team.

385
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:09,145
[SPEAKER_00]: This team returns a ton of seniors this year that played a lot of football the past two seasons.

386
00:35:09,165 --> 00:35:09,926
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little mixture.

387
00:35:09,946 --> 00:35:12,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Really no excuse of not being up for games.

388
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:18,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Little mixture of young and a lot of seniors, but they do have a lot of young players out there too.

389
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:23,529
[SPEAKER_01]: So back deep for the Boxers, we'll see Kasey Rhodes.

390
00:35:24,229 --> 00:35:25,590
[SPEAKER_01]: God, that was just a great play.

391
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:32,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Great throw by the quarterback Landry.

392
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:40,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Kasey Rhodes will be back deep along with, that looks like number two for the Boxers, Antoine Hart.

393
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:42,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Alon Hart, I'm sorry.

394
00:35:43,438 --> 00:35:43,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And.

395
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like Rhodes is back to ya.

396
00:35:53,537 --> 00:35:55,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladini-Balouse is back there too.

397
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,578
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the kick for number five from Lincoln-Selberry.

398
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:03,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like Lincoln-Selberry has had the ball the entire quarter.

399
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,499
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Marcus Cassell, the senior, kicker.

400
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,460
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great boot.

401
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,461
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna take him all the way back to, and he's gonna take an ace.

402
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:15,461
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good kick.

403
00:36:15,981 --> 00:36:18,141
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see that in high school, Robert, it goes all the way to the end zone.

404
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:21,342
[SPEAKER_00]: And Broxton will get their second possession of the day.

405
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:28,637
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, they got a first down on a third and seven pass to the senior receiver.

406
00:36:29,297 --> 00:36:32,339
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're 0-2, you just can't give teams good field positions.

407
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:35,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Brogdon has done that in two consecutive series.

408
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:36,582
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't do that.

409
00:36:36,642 --> 00:36:45,688
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was very iffy about going for it at midfield instead of just maybe kicking it away, pinning him, and go from there.

410
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:47,369
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is what it is.

411
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,551
[SPEAKER_00]: So Samedo will start out.

412
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,331
[SPEAKER_00]: In the pistol, two right receivers left with Luke Turco in the backfield.

413
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:57,271
[SPEAKER_00]: First and 10 at their own 20.

414
00:37:00,432 --> 00:37:02,052
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap and Turco has space.

415
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:06,374
[SPEAKER_00]: He busts it up inside and he keeps those legs moving for about a three yard gain.

416
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:12,895
[SPEAKER_00]: As Lincoln Sudbury is giving up a ton of size on the defensive line, but they're just getting in the backfield.

417
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:13,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure don't look like it.

418
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:18,216
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tell who's the bigger of the two right now.

419
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:20,377
[SPEAKER_00]: So Luke Turco gains about three there.

420
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:23,905
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll go second and seven.

421
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:28,728
[SPEAKER_00]: About the 24 yard line, 23 and a half.

422
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:32,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo will go into the pistol along with Turco.

423
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Two receivers to the right again, one to the left.

424
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:47,840
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap, and the ball's gonna go to Mighty, Jared Mighty, and a sweep, and he has a little bit of room, and he uses that electric speed to gain about 12 yards.

425
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:50,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, once he turns the corner, that speed

426
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:54,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Very fast kid, able to get the first down.

427
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:59,584
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he was the 400 meter champion in the state, or 200 in the indoors.

428
00:37:59,704 --> 00:38:02,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Just visited Army for track recently.

429
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:05,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers at a first down at around their 32.

430
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:07,646
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap, the ball's gonna go to Turco.

431
00:38:07,706 --> 00:38:08,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco busts it up the middle.

432
00:38:09,946 --> 00:38:14,207
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's gonna be tackled, a game tackle, and we've said his name a bunch of times tonight.

433
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:17,128
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be number 51, Kevin Abar.

434
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:20,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Good game by Luke Turco there.

435
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like about maybe four or five.

436
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:28,281
[SPEAKER_00]: So a game for five by Turco, and Casey Rhodes comes in.

437
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:35,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brockton looking over to head offensive coordinator Derrick Barrows for the call.

438
00:38:35,587 --> 00:38:37,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo talking to his offensive line.

439
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:41,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton has quads out there, two to each side as the receivers.

440
00:38:44,174 --> 00:38:44,775
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a snap.

441
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:46,356
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's gonna go to Rhodes.

442
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:47,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a keeper, nice play fake.

443
00:38:48,198 --> 00:38:50,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo's got room, and he fumbled the ball.

444
00:38:51,443 --> 00:38:57,749
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had the first down, he looked like he was extending the ball instead of protecting it, and an uncostly turnover.

445
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:03,474
[SPEAKER_00]: A costly turnover for the Boxers, and they will give the ball to Lincoln Sudbury at the 45 after a good play call.

446
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:05,455
[SPEAKER_00]: But Cimino's gotta protect the football.

447
00:39:05,836 --> 00:39:08,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Brockton turnovers though hasn't really been an issue this year.

448
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:20,786
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm not mistaken, that might have been the first turnover for Brockton for the year, but again, Lincoln Sudbury starts in Brockton side of the field to begin another possession, third straight.

449
00:39:21,286 --> 00:39:23,427
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at 13 seconds of the first quarter.

450
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:25,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury leads the Brockton Boxers 7-0.

451
00:39:25,427 --> 00:39:32,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing the replay there, the ball just fumbled away.

452
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Sophomore wasn't able to corral it.

453
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:38,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sean Landry remains in the pistol.

454
00:39:38,663 --> 00:39:40,324
[SPEAKER_00]: The H back is in motion.

455
00:39:40,705 --> 00:39:46,948
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball he missed, looks like it's a missed assignment there and an easy tackle for, is that Ty Baker?

456
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:48,469
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gonna be Ty Baker.

457
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:57,855
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be the last play of the first quarter as we'll enter the end of it here and we're gonna head over to the second quarter with Lincoln Sudbury leaving seven to zero.

458
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:02,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the start we were looking for.

459
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:10,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Lincoln Sudbury in Brockton's territory to start all three possessions.

460
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:16,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems kind of flat, I mean, that's how I look at it.

461
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:20,198
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that concerns me, Orlando, is you don't mind losing.

462
00:40:20,258 --> 00:40:23,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like it when the teams come in here and they're more physical than you.

463
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:26,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it looks like Lincoln Sudbury's just being more physical than Brockton.

464
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:29,447
[SPEAKER_00]: So Coach Silver.

465
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:37,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach John Shelby, one of the best linebackers in Brockton history, as far as I'm concerned, the best player in the state when he was here.

466
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,102
[SPEAKER_00]: He will coach the defense and I'm sure that's something he talks about with these kids every day at practice.

467
00:40:43,582 --> 00:40:44,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical, physical, physical.

468
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:51,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of town scores, we got Nadick leading Milford 14 to seven, that's a big game.

469
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:59,485
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln Subway is going to go right to the line of scrimmage.

470
00:40:59,505 --> 00:41:01,107
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at the 45 yard line of Brockton.

471
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:03,089
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at a second and nine.

472
00:41:03,649 --> 00:41:08,475
[SPEAKER_00]: They have three receivers to the right, one to the left, one back next to Landry.

473
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:24,139
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the snap, he has room, it's gonna be a screen pass, number 21, that ball might have been a lateral, but they're gonna call it incomplete, so a fortunate play for the Boxers that he dropped out of here, a little bit of space.

474
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:32,006
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna look at about a third and nine, the second straight series for a third and nine, the last time they scored on a long touchdown pass.

475
00:41:32,566 --> 00:41:34,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton looking to get the stop here.

476
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:40,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a drop, it wouldn't went nowhere anyways, Brockton was right there, they read that very well.

477
00:41:43,784 --> 00:41:47,985
[SPEAKER_00]: So Landry talks to the coach and he is, they're huddling here.

478
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:50,826
[SPEAKER_00]: So third and nine, let's see what they do here.

479
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:53,607
[SPEAKER_00]: They have four receivers once again with one back.

480
00:41:57,568 --> 00:41:58,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're to both sides.

481
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:01,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Got back, he's got back.

482
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,109
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a quarterback.

483
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:03,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Keepey's gonna try to get to the outside.

484
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:04,369
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks, he looks.

485
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:05,690
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a man wide open.

486
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,311
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a broken play right there and it looks like he's gonna score a touchdown on that.

487
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:16,767
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a broken play, Orlando, where the Brockton corner came up to stop the run and he left his man.

488
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, completely ugly.

489
00:42:19,848 --> 00:42:22,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Third and long, that is unacceptable.

490
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:24,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

491
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:31,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, again, you give teams a good field position, it's easier, you know.

492
00:42:31,656 --> 00:42:39,621
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at here, Shawn Landry broke the pocket, looked like it was gonna be a design keeper, but the Brockton corner came up to stop him and

493
00:42:40,883 --> 00:42:42,383
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just an easy pitch and catch.

494
00:42:42,403 --> 00:42:47,724
[SPEAKER_00]: It was known within 15 yards of him at the end of that, and that's again what we talked about, just fundamental football.

495
00:42:47,824 --> 00:42:53,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got a young team like Lincoln Sudbury coming in here right now and just controlling just about everything.

496
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:54,806
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not good.

497
00:42:55,146 --> 00:43:02,707
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the point after, and that will be 14-nothing at the 11 minute mark of the second quarter.

498
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:05,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a good start, Leo.

499
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:13,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Well there's a lot of football left and it's going to be some tough times early in the season for a young coaching staff.

500
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:17,216
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at the score, 14 and nothing.

501
00:43:17,716 --> 00:43:24,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also looking at Brockton has only scored 14 points total this year in two games.

502
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at the sideline.

503
00:43:27,682 --> 00:43:30,223
[SPEAKER_01]: No emotion right now.

504
00:43:31,384 --> 00:43:39,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's head is down and it's almost like we're in the fourth quarter and the other team's about to take a knee and we're about to go shake hands out there, man.

505
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:42,150
[SPEAKER_00]: This can't happen, Leo.

506
00:43:43,327 --> 00:43:47,752
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers will send back the same threesome with Casey Rhodes.

507
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:53,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Alonhart and it looks like Jared Mighty.

508
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury kicker will be number five, Marcus Cassell.

509
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:00,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a good leg.

510
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,468
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another terrific kick.

511
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,706
[SPEAKER_00]: and that ball will go into the end zone for a touch back and the Boxers will take over for the first time this second quarter.

512
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:13,871
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you don't want to be in a field goal battle with Lincoln Sudbury, I'll tell you that.

513
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:14,571
[SPEAKER_01]: No you don't.

514
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:15,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that kid can kick.

515
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:22,829
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers, let's see what Coach Barros, the young offensive coordinator, has right here.

516
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:24,331
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had some nice plays.

517
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:26,853
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's been pretty creative this year.

518
00:44:27,253 --> 00:44:28,955
[SPEAKER_00]: They just haven't executed at times.

519
00:44:28,995 --> 00:44:32,438
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been plays to be made, and sometimes it's up to the kids just to make a play.

520
00:44:32,978 --> 00:44:34,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Coaches can't go out there and do it for them.

521
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:42,046
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers look like they're gonna bring out the senior fullback, Christian Flaherty, with Luke Turco behind him, and they're gonna try to play smash-mouth football.

522
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a good game out of town, Mansfield and Marshfield.

523
00:44:44,721 --> 00:44:46,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Mansfield's up three nothing early.

524
00:44:46,582 --> 00:44:47,863
[SPEAKER_00]: So Semedo was under center.

525
00:44:48,544 --> 00:44:49,425
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another fumble.

526
00:44:50,726 --> 00:44:51,807
[SPEAKER_00]: He just came out too early.

527
00:44:51,887 --> 00:44:55,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton will lose three yards right there as Semedo pulled out a little bit too quick.

528
00:44:56,931 --> 00:45:01,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's two fumbles in a row by Semedo and Brockton's gonna call a timeout here.

529
00:45:02,156 --> 00:45:03,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Young quarterback, like, you know.

530
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:06,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you got a sophomore quarterback,

531
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,441
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to deal with some growing pains.

532
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:15,484
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed a lot of promise in the early season in the scrimmage games against good teams.

533
00:45:16,185 --> 00:45:18,967
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not gonna get too down on him, but he's only a sophomore.

534
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:23,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So Coach Silva's gonna talk to the team.

535
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton down 14-nothing.

536
00:45:25,211 --> 00:45:30,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo Genitasio along with the legend, you know him all over the city, Orlando Galveo.

537
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike the Postman Simmons on the production, along with Curtis Reese.

538
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:44,136
[SPEAKER_00]: and Scott Labossiere.

539
00:45:44,356 --> 00:45:45,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna forget you, Scott.

540
00:45:46,437 --> 00:45:48,859
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good time out there by Silva.

541
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,802
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be about second and 12 for the Boxers.

542
00:45:53,842 --> 00:45:59,605
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll remain in the straight I. Yeah, it's predictable though.

543
00:45:59,785 --> 00:46:02,167
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of teams will say that you're gonna run the ball here, right?

544
00:46:02,944 --> 00:46:03,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they give it to Turco.

545
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:06,129
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got space, he gets up the middle, and it's a really good game.

546
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:09,275
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about seven yards, and that's what they wanted on first down.

547
00:46:09,295 --> 00:46:13,341
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton's gonna be at about third and about five right here.

548
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:14,203
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some room there.

549
00:46:14,223 --> 00:46:15,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton opened up the hole.

550
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:23,293
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're gonna go fast, they're gonna remain in the eye with two receivers and a tight end, Christian Flaherty the fullback.

551
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:33,061
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ball's gonna go to Turco, Brock didn't move there, that would look like a first down, but the wide receiver on the right side looked like he moved too quick.

552
00:46:34,062 --> 00:46:35,583
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be an offsides I think, Leo.

553
00:46:36,804 --> 00:46:39,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Or too many men on the field, I think that is gone.

554
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:43,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like the receiver moved also, let's see what the referees call.

555
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:48,812
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton's got a break there even though Luke Turco had the first down.

556
00:46:49,612 --> 00:46:58,196
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll add five yards on to the play as the Boxers will get a first down and going into that I right there, there's been some space.

557
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton might want to decline that because I think they picked up six.

558
00:47:01,378 --> 00:47:05,000
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, did they change the rule where they add five yards on and penalties like that to the end of the play?

559
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:11,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe so, I think that's only on holdings and stuff like that.

560
00:47:11,274 --> 00:47:16,259
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Brockton might want to decline this, they picked up six yards.

561
00:47:19,742 --> 00:47:25,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So looks like the Boxers do decline it, and they'll get a first down at about the 32 yard line.

562
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,493
[SPEAKER_00]: As they look like they'll remain in that I formation.

563
00:47:32,064 --> 00:47:37,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, when I say predictable, what I mean is you gotta give the ball to Lou Turco.

564
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:40,431
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna give the ball to Lou Turco, that's what I mean.

565
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,613
[SPEAKER_00]: We won tons of state championships in this offense.

566
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:45,035
[SPEAKER_00]: It's predictable, but it's tough to stop if you execute it.

567
00:47:45,255 --> 00:47:48,718
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, that's what I mean by predictable, because you have to feed this guy right here.

568
00:47:48,738 --> 00:47:49,919
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ball will go to Turco.

569
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:51,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco bounces out inside.

570
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,883
[SPEAKER_00]: He gains yards, he gains more yards, and he gains 10 yards.

571
00:47:54,343 --> 00:47:58,086
[SPEAKER_00]: He bounces off three or four tackles for a first down.

572
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:04,321
[SPEAKER_01]: That timeout might have been more about give the ball to Mr. Luke Turco, right?

573
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:09,223
[SPEAKER_00]: So, not a first down, it looked like he came to eat.

574
00:48:10,963 --> 00:48:18,606
[SPEAKER_00]: As Brockton is right around the 10 minute mark of the second quarter, down 14-nothing, they'll remain in the eye with Luke Turco and Christian Flaherty.

575
00:48:18,686 --> 00:48:19,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Good time here for a play action.

576
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:26,508
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ball will go to Flaherty, Flaherty moves those legs and it looks like he has enough for the first down, and he does.

577
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:37,101
[SPEAKER_00]: So the senior fullback, driving his legs forward, gets Brockton, they're back, their second first down of the drive.

578
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:39,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brockton around their own 45 yard line.

579
00:48:40,343 --> 00:48:50,328
[SPEAKER_00]: No change to the formation, they remain in the I. Lincoln-Surrey bears about everyone in the box right here.

580
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:52,549
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap.

581
00:48:53,343 --> 00:48:54,444
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ball will go to Turco.

582
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:57,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton looking, Turco bounce to the outside, he bounce to the inside.

583
00:48:57,806 --> 00:48:59,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside, outside, moving his legs.

584
00:49:00,528 --> 00:49:02,889
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a nice move by Luke Turco.

585
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:07,393
[SPEAKER_01]: The tackler thought he had him, Luke juked him, was able to get more yards than that.

586
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:13,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And wow, they're relying strictly on Luke Turco, I believe he asked to come out, Leo.

587
00:49:13,837 --> 00:49:16,319
[SPEAKER_00]: So Luke will go out for a rest, KC Rhodes comes in.

588
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:22,703
[SPEAKER_00]: That's three first downs in a row, Brockton will remain in the eye, the junior running back giving Luke a breath.

589
00:49:23,996 --> 00:49:27,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Christian Flaherty, the senior fullback, remains with him.

590
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,941
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a snap, and the ball will go to Rhodes.

591
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:34,142
[SPEAKER_00]: He moves his legs, and he gains about four yards.

592
00:49:34,282 --> 00:49:37,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised Brockton is not trying to do some kind of play action here.

593
00:49:38,464 --> 00:49:44,628
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, set up that run, let the run set up the pass, and kind of take a shot with Lopes.

594
00:49:52,298 --> 00:49:54,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Sajai Taylor is now in the backfield.

595
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a sophomore running back.

596
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,381
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll get set his first carry of the game.

597
00:50:02,364 --> 00:50:08,887
[SPEAKER_00]: As Brockton remains at about a second and seven, and the ball goes to the sophomore back, and he hits that, he hit that hole fast, Orlando.

598
00:50:08,947 --> 00:50:10,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice run by the sophomore.

599
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:12,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that was Rhodes that time.

600
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,184
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a 30.

601
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:15,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Sajai Tyler, that's gonna be a sophomore.

602
00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:16,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhodes got a break.

603
00:50:16,566 --> 00:50:19,989
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton uses the third back of the drive here.

604
00:50:20,509 --> 00:50:22,110
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sophomore will remain in there.

605
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,111
[SPEAKER_00]: He hit that whole fast.

606
00:50:23,131 --> 00:50:23,712
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good run.

607
00:50:24,892 --> 00:50:30,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So third down and about two at the 35 of Lincoln Sudbury.

608
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:33,979
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ball goes right back to him.

609
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:35,761
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has met, he keeps the legs moving.

610
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:39,734
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will gain about a yard.

611
00:50:39,754 --> 00:50:42,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might- Yeah, that's gonna get a 15-yard penalty.

612
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:45,279
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's gonna be on 51 from Lincoln Sudbury.

613
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:48,101
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been their best player on defense tonight, but that was just a little bit too much.

614
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:49,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a little bit too much.

615
00:50:49,402 --> 00:50:51,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the whistle clearly blew.

616
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:52,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Aviar, the senior.

617
00:50:52,725 --> 00:50:54,706
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you just can't do that.

618
00:50:54,906 --> 00:51:01,291
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen Brockton do that the last couple of weeks, and now we see the opponent giving Brockton yards.

619
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:04,334
[SPEAKER_00]: So that weighed 15 yards to the player.

620
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:06,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of fourth down and one, Brockton will have a first down.

621
00:51:08,259 --> 00:51:10,460
[SPEAKER_00]: around the 20-yard line as they enter the red zone.

622
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Some place they haven't been a ton this season.

623
00:51:12,221 --> 00:51:15,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Coach Barros does here.

624
00:51:16,004 --> 00:51:18,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton's remained in the eye this drive, and they've moved the ball well.

625
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:21,767
[SPEAKER_00]: But Lincoln Subway has just about everyone in the box.

626
00:51:22,067 --> 00:51:23,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton's gotta punch this in.

627
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:26,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Jayden Los Ribeiro to the right has man coverage.

628
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:31,753
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ball will go to the sophomore.

629
00:51:31,773 --> 00:51:33,174
[SPEAKER_00]: He cuts it inside, a nice run.

630
00:51:34,355 --> 00:51:35,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps his legs moving, good vision.

631
00:51:37,247 --> 00:51:38,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's what Rhodes does.

632
00:51:38,408 --> 00:51:40,469
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks like he's gonna go outside, then he cuts in.

633
00:51:43,211 --> 00:51:43,832
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great run.

634
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:45,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Picked up about five.

635
00:51:47,174 --> 00:51:48,735
[SPEAKER_01]: All runs right now for Brockton.

636
00:51:50,657 --> 00:51:56,701
[SPEAKER_00]: So Casey Rhodes and Brockton getting a lot of help from their sophomore and junior backs here.

637
00:51:57,101 --> 00:51:58,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them moving their legs with good vision.

638
00:51:58,903 --> 00:52:00,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice run by Casey Rhodes right there.

639
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:04,814
[SPEAKER_00]: using his blockers, getting into space, and lunging forward.

640
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:10,658
[SPEAKER_00]: So a five yards will give the Boxers second and five at the 15 yard line, their deepest penetration of the night.

641
00:52:10,698 --> 00:52:15,962
[SPEAKER_00]: They remain in the I. And the ball goes to Casey Rhodes, bouncing up inside.

642
00:52:16,202 --> 00:52:17,924
[SPEAKER_00]: He has space, another good move.

643
00:52:19,044 --> 00:52:20,505
[SPEAKER_00]: And he will gain about four.

644
00:52:20,826 --> 00:52:23,467
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gonna be just short, probably about inches.

645
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:25,169
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gonna set up a good...

646
00:52:26,735 --> 00:52:27,756
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a man miss there.

647
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:34,539
[SPEAKER_00]: He was about to get tackled for a loss, and Casey Rhodes used good vision, good footwork, to make a linebacker miss.

648
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,421
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at about third and two from around the 11, and we'll see Luke Turco in the game.

649
00:52:39,962 --> 00:52:46,045
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been battling a shoulder injury this week, that's why he's not in there every other down.

650
00:52:46,385 --> 00:52:48,566
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ball goes to the fullback, but they knew that was coming.

651
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:50,587
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew that was coming.

652
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,949
[SPEAKER_00]: So they try to be cute there with the fullback,

653
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,222
[SPEAKER_00]: and Lincoln Sudbury ate that up.

654
00:52:57,582 --> 00:52:58,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So fourth down and one.

655
00:52:59,063 --> 00:53:05,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that play call for fourth and inches, but I don't get that.

656
00:53:06,409 --> 00:53:08,411
[SPEAKER_00]: So they lose two yards there.

657
00:53:08,471 --> 00:53:09,151
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton will have.

658
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:09,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta get the ball to Turkle.

659
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:17,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton will be in the eye with Luke Turkle, Jayden Los Ribeiro to the right.

660
00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:20,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Big play, biggest play of the game for Brockton so far.

661
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:23,163
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right around the six minute mark of the second quarter.

662
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,231
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a snap, the ball's gonna go to Turco.

663
00:53:28,311 --> 00:53:29,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside, he tries to bounce it up.

664
00:53:29,711 --> 00:53:30,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and that's good visual by Luke.

665
00:53:31,352 --> 00:53:32,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was stopped in the backfield.

666
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps the legs moving, and he gains a first down.

667
00:53:36,174 --> 00:53:37,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all Luke Turco right there.

668
00:53:37,995 --> 00:53:39,636
[SPEAKER_01]: He should've been got.

669
00:53:40,256 --> 00:53:43,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury shooting gaps, they're getting guys into the backfield.

670
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,738
[SPEAKER_00]: The blocks of backs are making people miss.

671
00:53:44,778 --> 00:53:46,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is why you can't mess around him.

672
00:53:47,379 --> 00:53:49,380
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying give him the ball all the time, but.

673
00:53:50,721 --> 00:53:55,283
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and goal for the Boxers at about the eight, and Lincoln Sudbury will call a timeout.

674
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying give him the ball all the time, but give him the ball all the time.

675
00:53:59,521 --> 00:54:04,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've seen for the last two years, when he gets the ball, he averages about seven yards a run.

676
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:06,062
[SPEAKER_00]: So Luke is effective.

677
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,623
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is, Orlando, like other Brockton backs, had to play one way.

678
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke's also the leading tackler on the team.

679
00:54:11,284 --> 00:54:11,964
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs a break.

680
00:54:12,284 --> 00:54:13,504
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a physical running back.

681
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:14,985
[SPEAKER_00]: He's beat up a little bit.

682
00:54:15,725 --> 00:54:17,125
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long football season.

683
00:54:17,205 --> 00:54:19,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach Silva, Coach Barros know what they have in them.

684
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:20,446
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to lose them.

685
00:54:21,346 --> 00:54:30,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't know how much faith they have in Cimetto, but I would like a play, to keep the defense, I would like a play action off that.

686
00:54:30,471 --> 00:54:32,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to let them know, we have that arsenal too.

687
00:54:33,213 --> 00:54:35,254
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw him during the scrimmage game, does he throw the ball?

688
00:54:35,294 --> 00:54:37,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he can, he's more than capable of throwing the ball.

689
00:54:37,915 --> 00:54:39,496
[SPEAKER_01]: He can make a seven yard pass.

690
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:44,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you gotta have some plays out there where you can have space and where you can just get seven yards.

691
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:45,860
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a run, right?

692
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:54,323
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers will get some extra time here to talk about the next few plays as they try to cut into this Lincoln-Subbury lead.

693
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:57,264
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get the ball in the second half as they deferred.

694
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:00,386
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is huge for the Boxers to try to get in the end zone here.

695
00:55:01,467 --> 00:55:03,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Henry Hankmore's the center, the senior.

696
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:06,630
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a big game out of town today.

697
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Zavarian and Springfield Central.

698
00:55:09,412 --> 00:55:10,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just got an update on that.

699
00:55:10,993 --> 00:55:14,035
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 and nothing, Zavarian.

700
00:55:14,055 --> 00:55:16,517
[SPEAKER_01]: 55 yard touchdown run by Boost.

701
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:18,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Boosa for Severin.

702
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:21,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Springfield's finding out they're not playing Western Massachusetts anymore.

703
00:55:21,953 --> 00:55:23,956
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna remain in the eye here.

704
00:55:25,138 --> 00:55:27,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turk goes to back, the ball's gonna go to him.

705
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:29,460
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks for inside, looks and there's not much room there.

706
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at some areas, they are sending everyone in.

707
00:55:33,902 --> 00:55:35,382
[SPEAKER_01]: They're shooting gaps.

708
00:55:35,543 --> 00:55:37,764
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have to because there's not a lot of space there.

709
00:55:37,964 --> 00:55:42,426
[SPEAKER_01]: A little slant there, I mean you just, you gotta keep that defense honest there.

710
00:55:42,726 --> 00:55:46,607
[SPEAKER_00]: You gained about a yard there as the Boxers will go second and goal from about the five.

711
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:47,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Samedo's working fast.

712
00:55:49,384 --> 00:55:51,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Gets the ball, and the ball's gonna go to Turkle again.

713
00:55:51,145 --> 00:55:53,886
[SPEAKER_00]: He tries to bounce it to the outside, and he doesn't gain much.

714
00:55:54,707 --> 00:56:04,751
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna go third and goal from about the four yard line, as the boxers work to the left side that time after going to the right a few times.

715
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:05,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Good game by Luke.

716
00:56:06,472 --> 00:56:12,435
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you got two possessions, two downs, sorry, to get five yards.

717
00:56:14,312 --> 00:56:16,073
[SPEAKER_00]: They really haven't gained much these first two downs.

718
00:56:16,113 --> 00:56:21,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, Lincoln Sudbury lost Kevin Abia, their linebacker, but their backups have come in and done a nice job.

719
00:56:22,294 --> 00:56:23,775
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boxers remain in the eye.

720
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:26,056
[SPEAKER_00]: One wide receiver to the right, one to the left.

721
00:56:26,076 --> 00:56:28,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody pinched in for Lincoln Sudbury right now.

722
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:30,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's in the box except for the two corners.

723
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:34,204
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it is, there's the play you're looking for.

724
00:56:34,244 --> 00:56:36,325
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a screen, oh, it hit him in the hands, he's gotta catch it.

725
00:56:36,965 --> 00:56:40,967
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a nice throw, and the ball is dropped by the receiver.

726
00:56:41,087 --> 00:56:42,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it should've been caught right in his hands.

727
00:56:44,389 --> 00:56:47,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little bit to the side, but if it hits you in the hands, you should catch it.

728
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,291
[SPEAKER_00]: That ball's gotta get caught.

729
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:51,433
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice throw, so the boxers gonna go fourth and goal.

730
00:56:51,713 --> 00:56:57,876
[SPEAKER_00]: That ball hit the senior receiver in the hands, and I think Brockton might be kicking the ball here.

731
00:56:58,936 --> 00:57:01,798
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boxers just wanna, it's a good drive, you wanna put points up in the board.

732
00:57:03,452 --> 00:57:05,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Broxton's got a very good field goal kick as well.

733
00:57:07,116 --> 00:57:08,737
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like the call here from Coach Silver.

734
00:57:08,757 --> 00:57:11,240
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't wanna have a long drive like that and come away with nothing.

735
00:57:12,861 --> 00:57:17,206
[SPEAKER_00]: The sophomore quarterback put the ball where it was supposed to right there and simply was not caught.

736
00:57:17,306 --> 00:57:21,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if it was two yards, but five, six yards, maybe a little bit too much.

737
00:57:24,493 --> 00:57:26,335
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kick and that ball is blocked.

738
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:38,838
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately after a long 70-yard drive, Brockton will turn the ball over after a blocked field goal attempt, and Lincoln-Subbury will take over the 10-yard line.

739
00:57:39,238 --> 00:57:41,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Still four minutes, five minutes left here, Orlando.

740
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a stop, use your timeouts.

741
00:57:43,341 --> 00:57:45,623
[SPEAKER_00]: You try to get the ball back and put some points up.

742
00:57:45,703 --> 00:57:50,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it was five yards, three points, don't need three points here, man.

743
00:57:50,946 --> 00:57:53,128
[SPEAKER_01]: You need seven, you need touchdowns.

744
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:55,570
[SPEAKER_01]: The other teams are scoring touchdowns,

745
00:57:56,979 --> 00:57:58,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Lincoln-Subbery had.

746
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,740
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not done much on the ground.

747
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:06,404
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken advantage of the Brockton secondary, especially a cornerback, where the Boxer Corners have, you know, they made a few mistakes tonight.

748
00:58:06,424 --> 00:58:09,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a little bit on that too with the block kick.

749
00:58:09,805 --> 00:58:15,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you get the ball at the 20 instead of, so if you had gone for it, and you don't get it, you get it at the five yard line.

750
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:18,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I was surprised that Brockton didn't go for that.

751
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:19,450
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point, Orlando.

752
00:58:20,471 --> 00:58:22,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln-Subbery will come out with a 14-nothing lead.

753
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:29,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Senior quarterback Sean Landry with two long touchdown pass tonight, he's been the difference.

754
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:33,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Another score from the out of town Duxbury up on Franklin, 13 to nothing as well.

755
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:37,912
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers remain in that 43 front as Lincoln-Subury will be under center.

756
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,574
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're gonna try to do too much here, take some time off the clock.

757
00:58:40,874 --> 00:58:42,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Space up the middle, and it's a good run.

758
00:58:42,655 --> 00:58:47,458
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boxer linebacker missed the tackle, and instead of a two yard game, that's gonna be a six yard game.

759
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,420
[SPEAKER_01]: CM playing Leinster tonight.

760
00:58:52,341 --> 00:58:54,422
[SPEAKER_01]: CM's up 14 to six, first half.

761
00:58:55,224 --> 00:58:58,166
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna go second and two at the Boxer 28.

762
00:58:58,266 --> 00:59:03,208
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at about the four minute mark of the second quarter.

763
00:59:03,968 --> 00:59:06,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo Genitassi along with the legend Orlando Galvao.

764
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton Boxer Football 2024, they're down 14-0.

765
00:59:14,454 --> 00:59:18,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean Landry remains under center with one back and two H-backs next to him.

766
00:59:20,072 --> 00:59:23,995
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's gonna be faked in motion, it's on the center, and Brockton is in the backfield right there.

767
00:59:24,315 --> 00:59:25,496
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a nice play by number 41.

768
00:59:25,556 --> 00:59:30,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybean, sophomore, almost took him apart.

769
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,542
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great stop.

770
00:59:33,142 --> 00:59:34,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with a third down and...

771
00:59:35,819 --> 00:59:41,222
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about him a ton last year, another one that should be a good college prospect, a good size, a good student too.

772
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:45,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrific play by the young defensive, sophomore defensive end.

773
00:59:45,745 --> 00:59:47,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's call it how it is too, Leo.

774
00:59:47,246 --> 00:59:49,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Third down in five years, you don't stop here.

775
00:59:49,287 --> 00:59:51,088
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to stop, you need to put the brakes on this.

776
00:59:51,808 --> 00:59:53,649
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot let them get a first down here.

777
00:59:53,669 --> 00:59:56,211
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised Coach Silver not calling any timeouts.

778
00:59:57,571 --> 01:00:05,316
[SPEAKER_00]: So third and five, look at somebody who'll go to the pistol, they'll go three wide receivers to the left, one to the right, with one back next to the Landry.

779
01:00:07,926 --> 01:00:09,227
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a snap, he's gonna go back.

780
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:12,189
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking to throw, he's looking to throw, and that ball, it's caught.

781
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:13,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he dropped it.

782
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:15,352
[SPEAKER_00]: That was... Right in his hands.

783
01:00:15,852 --> 01:00:16,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in his hands.

784
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:17,694
[SPEAKER_00]: It was there.

785
01:00:17,854 --> 01:00:18,234
[SPEAKER_00]: It was there.

786
01:00:18,254 --> 01:00:22,257
[SPEAKER_00]: The Brockton... Jayden Loserbero looked like he just misplayed the ball.

787
01:00:22,297 --> 01:00:22,678
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball...

788
01:00:24,327 --> 01:00:25,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it looks like he's peeking in the backfield.

789
01:00:25,908 --> 01:00:32,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a big drop too, because now Brockton does not have to use a timeout, and Lincoln Sudbury's gonna punt it.

790
01:00:32,734 --> 01:00:36,678
[SPEAKER_00]: So after gaining eight yards on first down, the Brockton defense does exactly what they're supposed to do.

791
01:00:36,718 --> 01:00:43,023
[SPEAKER_00]: They get off the field, and it looks like they'll give the offense the ball back with about the three minutes left of the second quarter.

792
01:00:43,143 --> 01:00:45,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out, Jared Mighty, back deep for Brockton.

793
01:00:45,525 --> 01:00:46,586
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a kick, it's a good one.

794
01:00:47,066 --> 01:00:47,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Mighty gets the ball.

795
01:00:48,027 --> 01:00:48,988
[SPEAKER_00]: He has room up the middle.

796
01:00:49,028 --> 01:00:50,950
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets to the right side, and it's a nice tackle.

797
01:00:52,226 --> 01:00:57,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, what a tackle by 15 for Lincoln Sudbury or else he would have had at least 15 more yards.

798
01:00:57,567 --> 01:00:59,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's their quarterback Sean Landry making that tackle.

799
01:01:02,169 --> 01:01:04,209
[SPEAKER_00]: So the box is still with great field position.

800
01:01:04,249 --> 01:01:06,170
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take over at the 45 yard line.

801
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,490
[SPEAKER_00]: They're down 14-0.

802
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Coach Derrick Barrows has in mind here for Brockton.

803
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:15,872
[SPEAKER_00]: They have skilled the wide receiver this year with some of the scene receivers along with Jared Mighty.

804
01:01:17,518 --> 01:01:18,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey Rhodes will be the back.

805
01:01:18,879 --> 01:01:20,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton looks like they're gonna go trips to the right.

806
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,121
[SPEAKER_00]: And Luke starts on the sidelines in his big possession.

807
01:01:28,663 --> 01:01:32,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Jayden Wooten looks like he's out there with Lopes Ribeiro, Jared Mighty, and Alon Hart.

808
01:01:38,388 --> 01:01:39,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gonna be his room over there.

809
01:01:39,748 --> 01:01:41,709
[SPEAKER_00]: If he gets to the outside, Mighty shows some of that speed.

810
01:01:41,729 --> 01:01:45,051
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets to the outside, and that's gonna be a nice game of about six yards.

811
01:01:45,976 --> 01:01:50,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice call by Coach Barrows, just getting the ball and space to some of the better athletes.

812
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:53,603
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers will gain six there, they're at midfield.

813
01:01:53,963 --> 01:01:56,065
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the three minute mark of the second quarter.

814
01:01:56,606 --> 01:01:57,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Boxers down 14-nothing.

815
01:02:02,044 --> 01:02:06,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Cimino remains in the pistol, DeLone back, looks like it's Casey Rose, just trips to the right.

816
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:09,068
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rose looks like he's gonna get the ball, cuts up inside.

817
01:02:09,088 --> 01:02:12,030
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be a hold on Brock, didn't have to do it either.

818
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose had the first down, that was on the other side.

819
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:16,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's an easy call, it was indeed a hold.

820
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:19,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, another penalty is gonna bring Brockton back.

821
01:02:20,455 --> 01:02:24,637
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rose had enough to pick up the first down, the box is undisciplined once again.

822
01:02:25,178 --> 01:02:28,180
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll lose 10 yards and that will look like it'll be now

823
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,961
[SPEAKER_00]: The second and 12 from around the 43 if it's marked off where we think it is.

824
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:38,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Brockton has an opportunity here to drive score.

825
01:02:38,562 --> 01:02:40,223
[SPEAKER_01]: They get the ball to start the second half.

826
01:02:42,483 --> 01:02:45,924
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Boxers are gonna go back to about their 42.

827
01:02:46,004 --> 01:02:49,825
[SPEAKER_00]: They gotta get to the Lincoln-Subury 46 for a first down.

828
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Samedo looking over at Coach Barrows.

829
01:02:54,321 --> 01:02:55,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Kasey Rhodes is the lone back.

830
01:02:55,762 --> 01:02:57,623
[SPEAKER_00]: They got trips to the left, one to the right.

831
01:02:58,143 --> 01:02:59,244
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Jaden Wooten.

832
01:02:59,564 --> 01:03:01,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out for a deep shot here to Lopes.

833
01:03:03,626 --> 01:03:06,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Second and 13, the Boxers need to make some plays.

834
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Samedo's back, back, he's looking, he's looking.

835
01:03:14,032 --> 01:03:15,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't throw it anyway, just didn't.

836
01:03:16,817 --> 01:03:18,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking for Lopes on a screen.

837
01:03:18,778 --> 01:03:21,658
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the quarterback and the receivers weren't on the same page right now.

838
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:22,699
[SPEAKER_01]: At all, at all.

839
01:03:22,919 --> 01:03:24,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was looking to go deep.

840
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:26,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Jadon Lopes, Ribeiro was blocking.

841
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:26,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Now offensively.

842
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who he was looking for.

843
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton on the passing game offensively right now.

844
01:03:30,821 --> 01:03:33,341
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, let's call it how it is, they're looking like a mess.

845
01:03:33,401 --> 01:03:34,142
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look good.

846
01:03:34,782 --> 01:03:36,302
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers will go third and 13.

847
01:03:36,822 --> 01:03:38,543
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the athletes to make big plays.

848
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:40,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's early in the season.

849
01:03:40,923 --> 01:03:42,744
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of football left to be played.

850
01:03:44,503 --> 01:03:46,925
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this game, still a lot of football left.

851
01:03:46,965 --> 01:03:49,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if the Boxers can convert a long one here, third and 13.

852
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:52,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick it in here, boys, come on, still early.

853
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:54,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo remains in the pistol.

854
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:58,573
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boxers line up again, they're having trouble getting to where they're supposed to be.

855
01:03:59,654 --> 01:04:01,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Four receivers, two to each side.

856
01:04:04,918 --> 01:04:07,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo back, he's got time, he's got a lot of time.

857
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,022
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking, he's looking, he throws the ball over the middle, it's into triple coverage.

858
01:04:12,218 --> 01:04:13,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's intercepted.

859
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there wasn't anyone open.

860
01:04:14,781 --> 01:04:16,203
[SPEAKER_00]: The routes were all down the field.

861
01:04:16,743 --> 01:04:18,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln knows he's going to throw the ball.

862
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:19,366
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no place to throw it.

863
01:04:19,386 --> 01:04:20,027
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a punt.

864
01:04:20,928 --> 01:04:23,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some medals looking for a late hit.

865
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're not going to get that.

866
01:04:27,215 --> 01:04:28,937
[SPEAKER_01]: But he felt like he got hit late.

867
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:30,110
[SPEAKER_00]: No call.

868
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:32,831
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers will turn the ball right back over.

869
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:34,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln-Subbery has time now.

870
01:04:34,151 --> 01:04:35,511
[SPEAKER_00]: They have decent field position.

871
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:39,372
[SPEAKER_00]: If they wanna go down and really put like a nail in the coffin to the Boxers here.

872
01:04:39,392 --> 01:04:43,493
[SPEAKER_00]: If they think the Broxers gonna score three touchdowns in the second half when they've only scored two the whole season.

873
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:49,535
[SPEAKER_00]: If Lincoln-Subbery wants to be aggressive here, they could really, really put Brockton in a tough position tonight.

874
01:04:49,855 --> 01:04:53,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, get a first down, you get over midfield and the penalty brings you back.

875
01:04:54,496 --> 01:04:56,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Been the story of the season for Brockton.

876
01:04:56,656 --> 01:04:59,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Very undisciplined at times.

877
01:05:02,505 --> 01:05:10,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sean Landry, the senior, junior quarterback will remain, they're gonna go in the pistol this time with two receivers to the left, one to the right, with one back.

878
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton remains in that 43 front with two safeties back.

879
01:05:14,717 --> 01:05:18,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry's gonna look to throw, he has time, he has time, he's gonna look to run, now he has a little bit of room.

880
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton comes up, they miss some tackles, and he's gonna gain about 12 yards.

881
01:05:23,862 --> 01:05:27,004
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like he just outran three linebackers, they took bad angles.

882
01:05:27,244 --> 01:05:28,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know he can run, man.

883
01:05:28,985 --> 01:05:32,067
[SPEAKER_01]: On the punt, he was the first one down and didn't make the tackle, so.

884
01:05:32,207 --> 01:05:37,410
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad angles by the Boxer backs there, they had chances to make plays and they just, just bad angles.

885
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:40,452
[SPEAKER_00]: So first down for Lincoln Sudbury at their own 39.

886
01:05:42,102 --> 01:05:43,223
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're looking to get more points.

887
01:05:43,263 --> 01:05:45,826
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bad snap, and they should get him in the backfield, and they do.

888
01:05:47,128 --> 01:05:51,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So a nice tackle there by number 36 from Brockton.

889
01:05:53,535 --> 01:05:56,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Jalen Jackson, the senior, he's been a three-year starter.

890
01:05:56,679 --> 01:05:59,422
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ is a really good football player, terrific kid.

891
01:06:00,475 --> 01:06:02,257
[SPEAKER_00]: When he's healthy, he makes a difference out there.

892
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:04,700
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln-Subbury loses three.

893
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,602
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna go at about the two minute mark.

894
01:06:06,642 --> 01:06:08,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton not using any timeouts.

895
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:11,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look at the score, but again, the same story, Leo.

896
01:06:11,026 --> 01:06:12,248
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a zero.

897
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:14,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Offensively, Brockton.

898
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:15,992
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good enough, Orlando.

899
01:06:16,212 --> 01:06:16,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Scoring points.

900
01:06:17,253 --> 01:06:21,478
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll go under center this time with an H back and a back behind him.

901
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:26,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Boxers put a bunch of guys in the box, and it's a fake.

902
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:28,386
[SPEAKER_00]: And they throw the ball over, and he's wide open.

903
01:06:28,446 --> 01:06:29,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Great play call.

904
01:06:29,867 --> 01:06:32,507
[SPEAKER_00]: He snuck out of the backfield, and he was, whoa, he fumbled the ball.

905
01:06:32,967 --> 01:06:33,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton's got it.

906
01:06:34,028 --> 01:06:37,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that is a break for Brockton, because Lincoln-Subbery had a first down.

907
01:06:38,168 --> 01:06:42,849
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's gonna be Jalen Jackson, as Lincoln-Subbery, it was a terrific play call.

908
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:44,730
[SPEAKER_00]: And what a call too, I mean.

909
01:06:45,716 --> 01:06:51,557
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great call, but again, the kid tried to get more yards, and then he lost the ball if he had just gone down.

910
01:06:51,857 --> 01:06:54,858
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to do, but a big turnover.

911
01:06:54,918 --> 01:06:56,338
[SPEAKER_00]: So a huge break for the Boxers.

912
01:06:56,378 --> 01:07:01,600
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get the ball back now, right around the 45-yard line, and a throwing situation here.

913
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Coach Barrows has this series.

914
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton's got the ball down deep two series ago, down to the five-yard line.

915
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:10,742
[SPEAKER_00]: They were unable to punch it in.

916
01:07:10,782 --> 01:07:12,542
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a field goal blocked.

917
01:07:14,462 --> 01:07:16,844
[SPEAKER_00]: and they remain down 14 points.

918
01:07:17,264 --> 01:07:18,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Wholesale changes from the sidelines.

919
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:25,710
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not on the same page.

920
01:07:29,953 --> 01:07:31,354
[SPEAKER_00]: So Coach Barrow sending in.

921
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:39,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton will be in the pistol with Casey Rhodes, three receivers to the left, one to the right.

922
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Samedo's back, he's back.

923
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:48,797
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna go to Jared Mighty in space.

924
01:07:48,837 --> 01:07:49,758
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a little bit of room.

925
01:07:50,258 --> 01:07:53,381
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes a cut to the outside and he'll gain seven yards.

926
01:07:53,401 --> 01:07:54,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Good play call, Coach Barrows.

927
01:07:55,942 --> 01:07:57,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Get me athletes, the ball in space.

928
01:07:58,104 --> 01:08:00,706
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to use Jared Mighty, you gotta use that speed.

929
01:08:01,306 --> 01:08:04,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So a gain of seven, we're about a minute 30 of the second quarter.

930
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:07,190
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see Brockton quicken up the pace.

931
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:09,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a football player, Jared Mighty, no gloves.

932
01:08:11,702 --> 01:08:13,682
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's gonna go, Mighty's gonna get the ball in a sweep.

933
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:18,543
[SPEAKER_00]: He's using that speed, he gets to the outside, he cuts it up, cuts it up back, and Brockton will have, I believe, another penalty.

934
01:08:19,264 --> 01:08:26,685
[SPEAKER_00]: And that penalty's gonna go on number nine for holding, and that will be Rommel Johnson, the senior.

935
01:08:27,485 --> 01:08:29,085
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't need to do it, he just didn't.

936
01:08:29,165 --> 01:08:36,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton, Mighty had the first down, Rommel Johnson, the hold will send them back.

937
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, every big play, there's gonna be a penalty, it looks like.

938
01:08:42,163 --> 01:08:42,503
[SPEAKER_01]: All season.

939
01:08:42,984 --> 01:08:44,724
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like every big play is gonna be a penalty.

940
01:08:44,864 --> 01:08:45,445
[SPEAKER_00]: All season long.

941
01:08:45,465 --> 01:08:47,326
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you call it the other side, I don't have a problem with it.

942
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:53,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Lincoln Suburban's had a bunch of penalties tonight, so these refs have been absolutely 100% fair.

943
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:56,530
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton loses 10 on the play.

944
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:59,352
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go second and 13 from their own 42.

945
01:09:01,162 --> 01:09:01,962
[SPEAKER_01]: but that was old.

946
01:09:02,863 --> 01:09:04,804
[SPEAKER_00]: It was old, it was a penalty.

947
01:09:04,824 --> 01:09:05,224
[SPEAKER_00]: It was old.

948
01:09:05,745 --> 01:09:06,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't need to do it.

949
01:09:07,205 --> 01:09:09,607
[SPEAKER_00]: So Semedo gets the play call from Coach Barrows.

950
01:09:19,853 --> 01:09:25,056
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the snap, he's got time, he looks, he looks, there's a throw over to space and a terrific, nice catch.

951
01:09:25,376 --> 01:09:25,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Mighty.

952
01:09:25,816 --> 01:09:26,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Jared Mighty again.

953
01:09:27,662 --> 01:09:30,442
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's gonna gain, yeah, that's eight yards.

954
01:09:31,003 --> 01:09:35,683
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball will be at midfield for a third down, about five for the Boxers.

955
01:09:37,204 --> 01:09:38,024
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball went out of bounds.

956
01:09:38,044 --> 01:09:41,704
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe they need to use a timeout.

957
01:09:41,804 --> 01:09:42,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they gotta change the clock.

958
01:09:42,905 --> 01:09:44,165
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they left the clock going.

959
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:47,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a metal, it's pointing at the clock.

960
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,746
[SPEAKER_01]: They might've let it run out.

961
01:09:55,527 --> 01:09:57,247
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ref is adding time to the clock.

962
01:10:02,404 --> 01:10:04,805
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's saying 104.

963
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:07,506
[SPEAKER_00]: 108, they'll add 11 seconds to the play clock, which will help Brockton.

964
01:10:08,207 --> 01:10:10,708
[SPEAKER_00]: There you have the ball at midfield, very third and five.

965
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:13,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turco's in the game.

966
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:17,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what the boxers have here.

967
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,813
[SPEAKER_00]: They're down around the minute 10 mark.

968
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:23,794
[SPEAKER_00]: They need big plays here.

969
01:10:23,854 --> 01:10:25,194
[SPEAKER_00]: They're down by 14 points.

970
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:27,495
[SPEAKER_01]: What a nice screen call to Luke.

971
01:10:29,436 --> 01:10:31,277
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Rommel Johnson and

972
01:10:33,297 --> 01:10:37,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Lucas Andrade, Jared Mighty to the right with Rommel.

973
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:45,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Samedo back to pass, he's got time, he looks, he's fading over, and he just has to throw it away.

974
01:10:46,221 --> 01:10:51,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So Orlando, it's third and five in, they're running their receivers 30 yards down the field.

975
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:56,386
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see him just throw the ball seven, eight yards like they've had, like they've shown.

976
01:10:57,026 --> 01:10:58,487
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't go all deep.

977
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:04,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, you gotta have some seven yard plays, five yard plays.

978
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So the box is, there's a flag on the play, let's see what it is.

979
01:11:11,355 --> 01:11:14,638
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a legal man downfield, over the line of scrimmage.

980
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:17,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like it was over the line of scrimmage.

981
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,822
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton's gonna have to pump the ball, because it's a loss of downs.

982
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,502
[SPEAKER_01]: This first half has been very ugly offensively.

983
01:11:24,962 --> 01:11:28,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about this a lot last year when Coach Jermaine Wiggins was here.

984
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:32,728
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a young football team, but I saw growth offensively with them right from the start, Orlando.

985
01:11:32,768 --> 01:11:35,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we're gonna see that from Brockton starting in the second half here.

986
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:42,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta make sure of young players and seniors, so sometimes you need games under your belt.

987
01:11:45,697 --> 01:11:47,238
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna get a timeout.

988
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:49,840
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at a minute of the second half.

989
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Leo, I'm gonna tell you something, right?

990
01:11:55,183 --> 01:11:56,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln sub recall that time out, okay.

991
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:57,805
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Brockton.

992
01:12:00,308 --> 01:12:04,412
[SPEAKER_00]: So again we're here at Rocky Marciano Stadium in the campus of Brockton High School.

993
01:12:04,632 --> 01:12:07,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo Genitasio along with the legend Orlando Galvao.

994
01:12:07,995 --> 01:12:11,038
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Mike the Postman, Postman Simmons on the production.

995
01:12:11,418 --> 01:12:15,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Curtis Reach and Scott Labossiere on the cameras.

996
01:12:17,779 --> 01:12:18,499
[SPEAKER_01]: and video help.

997
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:24,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Kai Boston Knight here at the stadium.

998
01:12:26,983 --> 01:12:29,164
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boxers will send Mighty out to punt.

999
01:12:30,284 --> 01:12:32,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta say this, be careful for the fake punt.

1000
01:12:32,886 --> 01:12:34,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Mighty, he gave him the ball last.

1001
01:12:35,027 --> 01:12:36,127
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had two fake punts, right?

1002
01:12:36,207 --> 01:12:36,947
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta be careful.

1003
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:37,708
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a threat.

1004
01:12:37,768 --> 01:12:39,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, teams have been scouting that.

1005
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,349
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't do that every game.

1006
01:12:40,409 --> 01:12:42,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Good football teams will scout you and they'll take that away.

1007
01:12:45,297 --> 01:12:47,778
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mighty has it, and he will punt it.

1008
01:12:48,078 --> 01:12:49,758
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ball goes off the side of his foot.

1009
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:57,660
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lincoln Sudbury will get terrific field position at about 57 seconds of the second quarter.

1010
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,101
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than two big pass plays, Brockton's done a nice job defensively, Orlando.

1011
01:13:01,301 --> 01:13:02,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Two breakdowns in the secondary.

1012
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:07,882
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at that kick, and you said maybe you should've just went for it.

1013
01:13:08,853 --> 01:13:11,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we knew he was gonna shake it off his foot, the answer's yes.

1014
01:13:11,435 --> 01:13:13,157
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's actually been a good punter this season.

1015
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:14,899
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had a lot of terrific balls.

1016
01:13:14,919 --> 01:13:15,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's done pretty good.

1017
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,401
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out to be a seven-yard punt.

1018
01:13:21,084 --> 01:13:23,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, yeah, it doesn't look like a seven-yard punt.

1019
01:13:23,827 --> 01:13:26,029
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a three-yard punt.

1020
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:30,333
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Lincoln Sudbury will take over at the box of 45.

1021
01:13:30,993 --> 01:13:33,516
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of time left to put their nail in the coffin.

1022
01:13:33,556 --> 01:13:34,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't think it can get

1023
01:13:36,472 --> 01:13:37,413
[SPEAKER_01]: That ball went sideways.

1024
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:39,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Worse, it gets even worse.

1025
01:13:39,554 --> 01:13:41,715
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's still in this game.

1026
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton giving a ton of cushion over here to the right side.

1027
01:13:47,078 --> 01:13:54,682
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's back to pass, and he's got room, he's gonna take a shot, and he's gonna get, oh that should be intentional grounding too, wasn't it Orlando?

1028
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:55,382
[SPEAKER_00]: No?

1029
01:13:55,442 --> 01:13:59,184
[SPEAKER_00]: He was out the pocket, but I don't know if that ball went across the line of scrimmage, but.

1030
01:14:00,045 --> 01:14:03,707
[SPEAKER_00]: So your MLA beam was there, along with Jalen Jackson.

1031
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:05,908
[SPEAKER_01]: That, I mean, he's,

1032
01:14:07,173 --> 01:14:09,114
[SPEAKER_01]: That ball did not cross the line of scrimmage at all.

1033
01:14:10,894 --> 01:14:12,035
[SPEAKER_01]: He just kind of just tossed it.

1034
01:14:12,355 --> 01:14:13,556
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's in the area, nothing.

1035
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:15,616
[SPEAKER_00]: So second and 10 for Lincoln-Sarberry.

1036
01:14:16,557 --> 01:14:17,677
[SPEAKER_00]: They're up 14-nothing.

1037
01:14:18,457 --> 01:14:20,678
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get ready for the Great Brockton.

1038
01:14:20,698 --> 01:14:21,759
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is, there's the call.

1039
01:14:21,819 --> 01:14:23,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, there's the call.

1040
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I was shocked that they didn't call it, but now they discussed it and they're calling it.

1041
01:14:30,275 --> 01:14:31,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was a no-brainer.

1042
01:14:31,516 --> 01:14:36,360
[SPEAKER_01]: You rolled out the pocket and you just throw it on the ground with no receiver there and it didn't even go past the line of scrimmage.

1043
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:37,781
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be a loss of downs.

1044
01:14:37,801 --> 01:14:38,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln-Sabre will go second and 15.

1045
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:41,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was almost a sack where they lost the ball.

1046
01:14:41,304 --> 01:14:42,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if they'll run the ball again.

1047
01:14:42,365 --> 01:14:43,727
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't wanna turn the ball back over.

1048
01:14:44,487 --> 01:14:48,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe take one big shot down the field and then get into halftime.

1049
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:53,415
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, they thought maybe they were gonna come in and be up 14 to nothing tonight.

1050
01:14:53,975 --> 01:14:54,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe they did.

1051
01:14:55,898 --> 01:15:01,422
[SPEAKER_00]: So the box is defensively gonna have to make a stop here to keep their offense in the game in the second half.

1052
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:06,126
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at- It's supposed to be second down, right?

1053
01:15:06,146 --> 01:15:07,206
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose it down, right?

1054
01:15:07,447 --> 01:15:09,228
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's intentional ground, it's a loss of downs.

1055
01:15:09,288 --> 01:15:10,289
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know the exact call.

1056
01:15:10,309 --> 01:15:11,109
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going on here?

1057
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:13,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the refs are coming over to talk about it.

1058
01:15:17,734 --> 01:15:18,875
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's right at midfield.

1059
01:15:20,472 --> 01:15:24,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if Brockton brings in some more safety help and try to not give up the big play.

1060
01:15:25,135 --> 01:15:28,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe take a linebacker off the field and put some more speed in the secondary.

1061
01:15:30,118 --> 01:15:30,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be second down.

1062
01:15:33,941 --> 01:15:34,881
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is second down.

1063
01:15:37,363 --> 01:15:40,545
[SPEAKER_00]: At midfield, Sean Landry's got two touchdown passes tonight.

1064
01:15:40,585 --> 01:15:41,646
[SPEAKER_00]: He's thrown one interception.

1065
01:15:42,346 --> 01:15:43,067
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been the difference.

1066
01:15:45,622 --> 01:15:47,183
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in the pistol with one back.

1067
01:15:47,603 --> 01:15:51,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like they left early, but there's the throw, he's in space, he's an easy pitch and catch.

1068
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:58,689
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be a seven yard gain, and we'll go third and eight at the box of 42.

1069
01:15:58,949 --> 01:16:00,410
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they gotta kick it with a big leg.

1070
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:04,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Just gonna say that, the scenario can play out where they can be playing for three here.

1071
01:16:05,073 --> 01:16:08,074
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to see a little bit tighter coverage there and not give up those easy yards.

1072
01:16:08,114 --> 01:16:14,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if Coach Shelby gets up on them here, uses some of that Brockton athleticism to take away the easy pitch and catch.

1073
01:16:15,822 --> 01:16:25,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm pretty sure they'll take seven, but three with that kicker is probably something that they're looking at.

1074
01:16:25,251 --> 01:16:28,715
[SPEAKER_00]: So huge cushions to the right side, Landry's back, he's looking, he's looking.

1075
01:16:28,815 --> 01:16:33,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, nice easy pitch and catch, and they will gain almost a first down.

1076
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,563
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like maybe six and a half, it could be fourth and one.

1077
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,740
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're able to do these seven yard plays.

1078
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,701
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't seem to have that in our arsenal right now.

1079
01:16:42,841 --> 01:16:46,322
[SPEAKER_01]: And the game becomes easier when you can.

1080
01:16:46,342 --> 01:16:47,783
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a simple pitch and catch.

1081
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:49,003
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a ton of space there.

1082
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:50,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton's playing back.

1083
01:16:50,224 --> 01:16:51,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach Shelby doesn't want to give anything over the top.

1084
01:16:52,364 --> 01:16:57,466
[SPEAKER_00]: But Lincoln Subber, he's taking stuff underneath and just two easy plays to gain 14 yards.

1085
01:16:57,826 --> 01:16:59,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at fourth and two.

1086
01:17:01,308 --> 01:17:02,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton needs a play here.

1087
01:17:08,184 --> 01:17:10,865
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are at 41 seconds.

1088
01:17:11,505 --> 01:17:12,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln-Subbury's gonna huddle up.

1089
01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:14,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what they do on fourth and one.

1090
01:17:15,086 --> 01:17:16,266
[SPEAKER_00]: They are gonna go under center.

1091
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:18,907
[SPEAKER_01]: First down will stop the clock momentarily.

1092
01:17:18,947 --> 01:17:20,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure they'll spike it.

1093
01:17:20,587 --> 01:17:22,127
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been creative offensively.

1094
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:25,828
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a snap.

1095
01:17:25,868 --> 01:17:28,289
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's gonna go to the back, and he has an easy first down.

1096
01:17:28,629 --> 01:17:28,969
[SPEAKER_00]: And more.

1097
01:17:29,349 --> 01:17:32,070
[SPEAKER_00]: As Luke Turco comes up from the tackle, and they gain three yards.

1098
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:33,990
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna be a penalty on Brock today.

1099
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:35,150
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be 15 yards.

1100
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:35,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 70.

1101
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:35,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1102
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, easy penalty.

1103
01:17:40,942 --> 01:17:45,747
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt about it, I mean he hits the Lincoln Sudbury player right in front of the referee.

1104
01:17:45,887 --> 01:17:48,309
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's gonna be 15 yards on the senior Jayden Seales.

1105
01:17:48,329 --> 01:17:48,969
[SPEAKER_00]: This is unacceptable.

1106
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:50,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach Shelby is not gonna be happy.

1107
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:55,675
[SPEAKER_00]: This has just been a poor night of Brockton football so far.

1108
01:17:55,695 --> 01:17:56,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not good enough.

1109
01:17:56,656 --> 01:18:04,102
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of the same things that have been happening on the last couple games with these penalties being undisciplined and it's carrying over here at,

1110
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:15,741
[SPEAKER_00]: So this 15 yards will give Lincoln Sudbury the ball at the Brockton 17 yard line, 35 seconds which is an eternity in high school football.

1111
01:18:16,302 --> 01:18:19,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's back, he looks, he looks, another just easy pitch and catch.

1112
01:18:20,344 --> 01:18:25,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Five more yards there, they're moving the ball right down the field, the same three plays to the same spot.

1113
01:18:26,628 --> 01:18:28,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Karens Antoine on the tackle.

1114
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:30,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton's gotta get up on those receivers.

1115
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:31,772
[SPEAKER_00]: They gotta make it more difficult.

1116
01:18:35,354 --> 01:18:39,558
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brock, so they're in the pistol with three receivers to the right, one to the left.

1117
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:50,609
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back to back Landry, he's got time, he's got time, he looks and he's got a ton of room and he's gonna go all the way down to about the four yard line.

1118
01:18:50,629 --> 01:18:53,211
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a flag down, let's see what it was.

1119
01:18:53,231 --> 01:18:57,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was, let's see what they call.

1120
01:18:57,215 --> 01:19:00,018
[SPEAKER_00]: But Landry got out of the pocket and there was no one there to contain.

1121
01:19:07,815 --> 01:19:10,518
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's gonna be like a legal formation.

1122
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:16,904
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big call here, because if it's on on them, if it's on on Lincoln, they are moving it back.

1123
01:19:16,944 --> 01:19:18,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln somebody would have the ball at the four yard line.

1124
01:19:19,727 --> 01:19:21,468
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna move them back five yards.

1125
01:19:24,211 --> 01:19:28,255
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're at 24 seconds, and Brockton desperately needs to play.

1126
01:19:30,819 --> 01:19:34,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Tough physical football here in the last few seconds of the half.

1127
01:19:34,762 --> 01:19:37,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Make no mistake, look at some of these guys that shared their penalties too.

1128
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:38,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine what the score might be.

1129
01:19:39,506 --> 01:19:41,288
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have penalties.

1130
01:19:41,308 --> 01:19:42,409
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been the better football team.

1131
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:43,590
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question about that.

1132
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:46,893
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been more physical, more athletic, better coach, better played.

1133
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:48,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Seemed like they wanted more too.

1134
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:51,076
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers will look at a

1135
01:19:53,107 --> 01:19:54,608
[SPEAKER_00]: second and 15 defensively.

1136
01:19:55,148 --> 01:19:58,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean Landry has been terrific at quarterback tonight.

1137
01:19:58,369 --> 01:20:00,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Lincoln-Subbury has here.

1138
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach Shelby's up on the line of scrimmage.

1139
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:03,531
[SPEAKER_00]: They're playing a little bit tighter.

1140
01:20:03,691 --> 01:20:05,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like they got another quarterback in there though.

1141
01:20:07,032 --> 01:20:07,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Number nine.

1142
01:20:10,753 --> 01:20:12,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope Landry's all right.

1143
01:20:12,414 --> 01:20:13,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'd be a big loss for them.

1144
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:16,816
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's back, he's got room, he throws the ball up for grabs.

1145
01:20:16,836 --> 01:20:17,736
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like he's open.

1146
01:20:18,736 --> 01:20:20,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that would've been a great catch.

1147
01:20:22,794 --> 01:20:27,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Wobbly throw, and that's what caused the receiver from making that catch.

1148
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:28,980
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a poor throw.

1149
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,122
[SPEAKER_00]: If he leads him, that's an easy touchdown.

1150
01:20:32,363 --> 01:20:35,606
[SPEAKER_00]: He was open, the ball, it wasn't a great throw, but he was open.

1151
01:20:36,366 --> 01:20:38,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at it right here, Orlando.

1152
01:20:39,229 --> 01:20:40,670
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at it, the throw.

1153
01:20:41,691 --> 01:20:43,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a touchdown if it's a better throw.

1154
01:20:44,734 --> 01:20:46,235
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice throw, it's a touchdown, but.

1155
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:48,437
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna go,

1156
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:53,525
[SPEAKER_00]: 3rd and 15 at the 20, Lincoln-Subbury within field goal distance.

1157
01:20:53,545 --> 01:20:57,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Their kicker's already kicked the ball out of the end zone, as Brockton will take a timeout here.

1158
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:00,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach Shelby wants to talk to his defense.

1159
01:21:00,968 --> 01:21:02,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I see Sam Basong down there too.

1160
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:04,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Two great Brockton, so they're getting coached.

1161
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:10,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two great Brockton high linebackers who played on championship teams, who played at a high level.

1162
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:19,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Descendants of Coach Bob O'Neal, former Brockton great quarterback and defensive coordinator.

1163
01:21:20,837 --> 01:21:22,938
[SPEAKER_00]: also a Super Bowl champion coach.

1164
01:21:26,179 --> 01:21:28,920
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers, down 14, nothing.

1165
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:30,981
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 19 seconds left in the first half.

1166
01:21:31,181 --> 01:21:35,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Brockton opponent, they're gonna play it down the line.

1167
01:21:35,403 --> 01:21:39,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Everett, final score there, BC High 46, and Everett, seven.

1168
01:21:41,385 --> 01:21:41,585
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1169
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:46,828
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing about Everett, I don't care what their record is early in the season, that team always gets better.

1170
01:21:47,188 --> 01:21:49,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they are the Brockton of the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

1171
01:21:50,963 --> 01:21:51,243
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.

1172
01:21:51,883 --> 01:21:54,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Brock always got better, Everett always gets better.

1173
01:21:54,364 --> 01:21:58,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Marshfield at halftime, 6-3 over Mansfield.

1174
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:59,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Low scoring game, surprisingly.

1175
01:22:00,907 --> 01:22:02,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at a third and 15.

1176
01:22:02,328 --> 01:22:16,854
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a new quarterback, number nine for Mansfield, for Lincoln-Sawberry, that's gonna be Mason Tarantino, the junior.

1177
01:22:16,894 --> 01:22:19,335
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back, he's back, he looks, he looks, he's got a man open.

1178
01:22:20,975 --> 01:22:22,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he dropped it.

1179
01:22:22,296 --> 01:22:24,478
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good coverage right there by Karens Antoine.

1180
01:22:24,538 --> 01:22:25,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Turned around right at the right time.

1181
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Last moment he turned around.

1182
01:22:27,362 --> 01:22:33,909
[SPEAKER_01]: If he did, that was going to be a penalty, but he turned around at the last moment and ended up making a spectacular play.

1183
01:22:34,009 --> 01:22:36,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good football play by Karens Antoine right there.

1184
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:39,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Turned around at the right time, got his hand up there.

1185
01:22:39,174 --> 01:22:42,238
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to watch the replay right here, Orlando, because he was open.

1186
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:51,436
[SPEAKER_01]: momentarily he was open, and Antoine was able to turn around just at the last minute to turn his head, and now, here comes Adam Vaninteri out here.

1187
01:22:51,516 --> 01:22:53,657
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big kick right here, this makes it a three score game.

1188
01:22:53,697 --> 01:22:57,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Lincoln Subrey, looks like about a 38 yarder, 39 yarder.

1189
01:22:58,901 --> 01:23:00,142
[SPEAKER_01]: This kid got the leg to do it.

1190
01:23:00,262 --> 01:23:04,065
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the bounce, the kick, oh that looks like it's good Orlando.

1191
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:15,711
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost a 40-yard field goal to give Lincoln-Sudbury a 17-0 lead at the 2-3 second mark of the first half.

1192
01:23:15,951 --> 01:23:19,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a half totally dominated by Lincoln-Sudbury.

1193
01:23:20,392 --> 01:23:23,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton's offense yet to get it going.

1194
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:29,414
[SPEAKER_01]: They did take one of their possessions to the five-yard line, and one was unable to cash in.

1195
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:32,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Still got another half to go though.

1196
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:35,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boxers will receive this kick right now.

1197
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:39,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect it to be a squib kick and Brockton's going to have to get into halftime.

1198
01:23:39,665 --> 01:23:47,249
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to have some serious conversations with themselves about how they're going to continue to play because last week against Franklin Orlando, me and you talked about this.

1199
01:23:47,449 --> 01:23:49,290
[SPEAKER_00]: The effort wasn't great late in that game.

1200
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look at Brockton again, they've only scored 14 points this season.

1201
01:23:53,272 --> 01:23:59,317
[SPEAKER_01]: and now that you're down 17 to nothing, so to win this game, you're gonna have to duplicate what you already scored and then some.

1202
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:01,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget about even winning at this point, it's about playing good football.

1203
01:24:02,019 --> 01:24:04,521
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Coach Silver and the rest of the guys, they just wanna play good football.

1204
01:24:04,781 --> 01:24:10,645
[SPEAKER_00]: No penalties, line up the right way, run the right formations, tackle, catch the ball, simple stuff like that.

1205
01:24:14,288 --> 01:24:15,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kicker will kick it.

1206
01:24:16,513 --> 01:24:19,715
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number five, Marcus Cassell.

1207
01:24:19,915 --> 01:24:21,636
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mighty, let's see if he has some space here.

1208
01:24:21,996 --> 01:24:24,858
[SPEAKER_00]: He sets up the middle, and he's hit really hard, and another penalty.

1209
01:24:25,078 --> 01:24:27,280
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna be a penalty on Brock, the legal hit in the back.

1210
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Just an unnecessary, silly penalty.

1211
01:24:31,062 --> 01:24:31,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was.

1212
01:24:32,363 --> 01:24:32,943
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a penalty.

1213
01:24:33,003 --> 01:24:35,685
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a penalty, I mean, right in front of the ref's face.

1214
01:24:35,745 --> 01:24:37,886
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for him not to take that flag and throw it.

1215
01:24:39,895 --> 01:24:43,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have on how many penalties Brockton's had during the first, gotta be close to six or seven already.

1216
01:24:43,258 --> 01:24:48,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean they've averaged about 10 a game so far, so now we're probably up to seven.

1217
01:24:48,802 --> 01:24:49,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean they're right on pace.

1218
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:55,006
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton will probably take a knee here.

1219
01:24:55,407 --> 01:24:57,268
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long first half.

1220
01:24:57,568 --> 01:25:01,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And Leo, it's like, these are legit penalties, I mean.

1221
01:25:02,492 --> 01:25:05,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Lando, I know if you wanted to complain about those reps you would.

1222
01:25:06,075 --> 01:25:08,677
[SPEAKER_00]: When you tell me they're legit penalties, they're legit penalties.

1223
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockets probably just gonna take a knee here.

1224
01:25:14,023 --> 01:25:17,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be very surprised if they hand off that ball, yep.

1225
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:27,979
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Orlando, we're gonna head into halftime here at Rocky Marciano Stadium at the end of the first half.

1226
01:25:29,018 --> 01:25:31,460
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lincoln Sudbury Warriors, 17.

1227
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton Boxers, zero.

1228
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:41,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes sir, they marched all the way from Lincoln Sudbury, a long ride here to Brockton, traffic filled, and boy did they come to play.

1229
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:24,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Get ready for one of the best halftime performances you're about to see.

1230
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:29,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1231
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:46,561
Oh, my God.

1232
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:10,976
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rochester High School Marching Band is proud to present their 2024 show, Flare.

1233
01:27:11,016 --> 01:27:21,781
[SPEAKER_02]: They share a distinction to the rich musical traditions of a variety of large cultures and colors.

1234
01:27:22,601 --> 01:27:27,103
[SPEAKER_02]: The Marching Band is honored to perform for you and to represent your senior champions.

1235
01:27:28,103 --> 01:27:38,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Now please welcome, under the field direction of drum majors Glenn Overstreet, Elijah Roman, and Damian Sampath, the Brockton High School Marching Band.

1236
01:28:03,272 --> 01:28:05,593
Yeah, Lenny!

1237
01:28:05,633 --> 01:28:06,573
Yeah, Lenny!

1238
01:32:47,193 --> 01:32:47,454
Woo!

1239
01:32:47,514 --> 01:32:47,774
Woo!

1240
01:34:36,562 --> 01:34:36,662
[SPEAKER_02]: uh oh

1241
01:35:15,564 --> 01:35:15,645
do

1242
01:37:06,656 --> 01:37:15,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for the marching band!

1243
01:37:15,531 --> 01:37:16,913
[SPEAKER_02]: One more show for Wingo!

1244
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:40,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Rocky Maciano Stadium in the campus of Brockton High School.

1245
01:37:40,933 --> 01:37:44,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo Genitasio along with the legend Orlando Galvao.

1246
01:37:44,816 --> 01:37:47,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton Community Access, you can catch us on the Brockton channels.

1247
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:51,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Orlando 2024 home opener.

1248
01:37:51,621 --> 01:37:54,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln-Subbury 17, Brockton zero.

1249
01:37:54,963 --> 01:37:58,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people, especially inside Brockton, thought this would be the score at halftime.

1250
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:04,151
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of leaves you speechless, right?

1251
01:38:04,792 --> 01:38:06,153
[SPEAKER_01]: That you see a goose egg there.

1252
01:38:06,854 --> 01:38:14,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Felt like Brockton was gonna come out with a lot of energy today and was able to, was going to take it to Lincoln-Subbury, but it's been the other way around.

1253
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:17,903
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton deferred to Lincoln-Subbury on their first drive.

1254
01:38:17,923 --> 01:38:20,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton intercepted the ball, had a quick first down.

1255
01:38:21,386 --> 01:38:23,448
[SPEAKER_00]: had to turn the ball back over.

1256
01:38:23,488 --> 01:38:27,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Lickett-Subbery turned that drive into a long touchdown pass.

1257
01:38:27,572 --> 01:38:29,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean Landry hit Shavon Harris.

1258
01:38:30,615 --> 01:38:33,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Broughton got the ball back one more time, fumbled it.

1259
01:38:34,038 --> 01:38:38,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Cimino, the quarterback, ran over the 50-yard line, looked like he had a first down, turned it over.

1260
01:38:38,982 --> 01:38:43,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, Lickett-Subbery turned a turnover into a touchdown in the second quarter.

1261
01:38:43,947 --> 01:38:46,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Another breakdown in the secondary for another long touchdown pass.

1262
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:48,330
[SPEAKER_00]: from Landry.

1263
01:38:48,891 --> 01:39:02,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton then Orlando had their longest drive of the day down 14 nothing going to the eye giving the ball to Turco Casey Rhodes in their sophomore back they got the ball down to the five yard line on third down a dropped touchdown missed field goal

1264
01:39:04,098 --> 01:39:06,301
[SPEAKER_00]: make it so he cuts down, kicks the field goal down to half.

1265
01:39:06,361 --> 01:39:07,382
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hasn't been good enough.

1266
01:39:07,722 --> 01:39:07,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1267
01:39:07,943 --> 01:39:10,806
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you, and then you, again, you, you drive all the way down there.

1268
01:39:11,287 --> 01:39:11,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Good drive.

1269
01:39:12,308 --> 01:39:16,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you, you're looking for three points, but in that situation, you need a touchdown.

1270
01:39:17,254 --> 01:39:19,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you don't get it, so what you pin them deep.

1271
01:39:20,397 --> 01:39:21,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they start from there.

1272
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:23,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Brockton, uh,

1273
01:39:24,879 --> 01:39:28,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Offensively, it's just nothing's going right.

1274
01:39:28,601 --> 01:39:35,404
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, from how they're running the play or how the play's being called, it's just nothing's going right right now.

1275
01:39:35,424 --> 01:39:38,266
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they don't have an identity yet, what type of football team they want.

1276
01:39:38,686 --> 01:39:42,708
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if Luke Turco is 100% healthy, they want to give him the ball as much as possible.

1277
01:39:42,968 --> 01:39:45,169
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes people miss, he gets into gaps.

1278
01:39:45,649 --> 01:39:48,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey Rose has showed some promise from the back position.

1279
01:39:48,711 --> 01:39:52,733
[SPEAKER_00]: They got running backs, but offensively throwing the ball, when they get into that,

1280
01:39:53,909 --> 01:39:57,932
[SPEAKER_00]: where they have to throw it, they just don't seem to be on the right page.

1281
01:39:58,312 --> 01:39:59,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember this though, remember this though, right?

1282
01:40:00,554 --> 01:40:15,783
[SPEAKER_01]: All excuses aside, they are missing Ahmad Wiggins out there today, and you look at Lincoln Sudbury, the first thing the coach told me is that they have a young team, but however, they have a senior quarterback, where Brockton has a sophomore quarterback, right?

1283
01:40:16,364 --> 01:40:20,787
[SPEAKER_01]: First year starter, I know last year he played in a lot of non-playoff games, but that's just not the same.

1284
01:40:21,887 --> 01:40:25,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's taking baby steps, and again, he's gonna make mistakes as you've seen today.

1285
01:40:25,949 --> 01:40:28,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Crucial fumble at midfield after getting the first down.

1286
01:40:28,911 --> 01:40:35,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And you kinda hope they make the plays easier for him too, right?

1287
01:40:35,914 --> 01:40:40,476
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have a situation where you have a third down and a sixth, and everybody's going deep.

1288
01:40:42,037 --> 01:40:44,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have seven yard plays in your arsenal?

1289
01:40:44,298 --> 01:40:45,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have six yard plays in your arsenal?

1290
01:40:45,878 --> 01:40:46,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.

1291
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:48,340
[SPEAKER_01]: How about a screen play?

1292
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:52,531
[SPEAKER_01]: All I'm seeing is a team lining up in the I. Chuck and Duck.

1293
01:40:53,191 --> 01:41:00,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And handing off to Luke Turco, which is fine, but then again, you're chucking it down the field when you have to throw the ball.

1294
01:41:00,933 --> 01:41:05,295
[SPEAKER_00]: So Coach Silva, the young first year coach, gonna get into the locker room after a first half.

1295
01:41:05,675 --> 01:41:08,436
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two games they played quality football in the first half.

1296
01:41:08,556 --> 01:41:12,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them, first game obviously they should have won, the second one they fell apart late.

1297
01:41:13,805 --> 01:41:17,307
[SPEAKER_00]: This game was not a great start, so Coach Silva's gonna talk to his team.

1298
01:41:17,367 --> 01:41:26,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he's gonna get a lot of help from his assistants talking about what we talked about, playing with emotion, playing physical football, playing penalty free.

1299
01:41:26,312 --> 01:41:28,193
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a start.

1300
01:41:28,433 --> 01:41:31,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of winning football games, you always wanna play good football.

1301
01:41:31,194 --> 01:41:33,195
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, they was in the locker room for a very long time.

1302
01:41:33,795 --> 01:41:41,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure they had a very firm conversation with the team, and now let's see what they do here in the second half,

1303
01:41:43,643 --> 01:41:45,664
[SPEAKER_01]: He do have 24 minutes to play in this game.

1304
01:41:45,804 --> 01:41:48,804
[SPEAKER_00]: A big part of this game has been Lincoln Sudbury's kicker, Marcus Gassell.

1305
01:41:48,884 --> 01:41:50,905
[SPEAKER_00]: He has kicked the ball into the end zone each time.

1306
01:41:51,265 --> 01:41:53,846
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kicked a 40 yard field goal to make this a three score game.

1307
01:41:54,086 --> 01:41:55,486
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been a difference maker so far.

1308
01:41:55,766 --> 01:41:56,366
[SPEAKER_00]: What year is he?

1309
01:41:57,146 --> 01:42:00,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he is a, he's a senior.

1310
01:42:02,188 --> 01:42:02,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Good kicker.

1311
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:04,468
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton will send back.

1312
01:42:04,528 --> 01:42:07,249
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they have Rhodes back there with Jared Mighty.

1313
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:11,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of kickers, Dallas Cowboys.

1314
01:42:12,384 --> 01:42:12,864
[SPEAKER_00]: He missed one.

1315
01:42:12,884 --> 01:42:13,845
[SPEAKER_00]: He missed one.

1316
01:42:14,025 --> 01:42:14,746
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't miss many.

1317
01:42:15,066 --> 01:42:18,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I mean, they get across midfield.

1318
01:42:18,330 --> 01:42:22,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any reason why you're concerned that he missed that one on FanDuel?

1319
01:42:22,355 --> 01:42:24,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there something on FanDuel that didn't go right for you?

1320
01:42:24,537 --> 01:42:27,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Post Malone, his buddy there, has some money on that game.

1321
01:42:28,381 --> 01:42:30,403
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Cassell, we're getting ready to

1322
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:33,571
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it going here in the second half.

1323
01:42:34,371 --> 01:42:46,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Leo Genitasio, Orlando Galvao, Mike the Postman-Simmons, Curtis Reese, Scott Laboussier, they do a terrific job giving you a first rate product at Brockton Community Access.

1324
01:42:46,655 --> 01:42:48,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, catch us on the Brockton channels.

1325
01:42:49,136 --> 01:42:56,799
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cassell will kick off, the Boxers will have their three deep as they look to start the second half and get themselves back in this football game.

1326
01:43:00,995 --> 01:43:02,396
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be returnable.

1327
01:43:02,696 --> 01:43:03,457
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is dropped.

1328
01:43:04,398 --> 01:43:05,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mighty has room.

1329
01:43:05,218 --> 01:43:05,939
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets up the middle.

1330
01:43:05,979 --> 01:43:06,599
[SPEAKER_00]: He has space.

1331
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be a touchdown.

1332
01:43:08,901 --> 01:43:10,842
[SPEAKER_00]: He has space and he will not be caught.

1333
01:43:11,323 --> 01:43:12,844
[SPEAKER_00]: And what a stop for the Boxers.

1334
01:43:13,124 --> 01:43:16,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Jared Mighty, we told you how explosive this guy is.

1335
01:43:16,867 --> 01:43:22,351
[SPEAKER_01]: We told you he's one break away from going all the way.

1336
01:43:22,371 --> 01:43:23,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you see it right now.

1337
01:43:23,532 --> 01:43:25,253
[SPEAKER_00]: What a start to the second half.

1338
01:43:25,273 --> 01:43:26,935
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what they needed, Leo.

1339
01:43:27,728 --> 01:43:30,109
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I look at somebody kicking in the end zone.

1340
01:43:30,549 --> 01:43:33,090
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jared Mighty showing that.

1341
01:43:34,591 --> 01:43:35,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the replay here.

1342
01:43:35,871 --> 01:43:36,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Elite speed.

1343
01:43:36,691 --> 01:43:37,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, took a bounce.

1344
01:43:38,732 --> 01:43:43,534
[SPEAKER_00]: He was able to pick it up, saw the gap, and then one guy left to catch him and forget about it.

1345
01:43:44,134 --> 01:43:44,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Gone.

1346
01:43:45,255 --> 01:43:47,235
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boxers are right back in this game.

1347
01:43:48,696 --> 01:43:49,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what they needed.

1348
01:43:50,737 --> 01:43:51,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that was electrifying.

1349
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:56,559
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you see schools looking at Mr. Mighty.

1350
01:43:58,596 --> 01:44:01,498
[SPEAKER_00]: So the extra point will be attempted, and it looks like it will be good.

1351
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:02,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.

1352
01:44:05,561 --> 01:44:13,427
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be Danny DaSilva, the junior kicker, as Brockton now makes it 17-7, and the defense will try to get the ball back for the Boxers.

1353
01:44:13,848 --> 01:44:16,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we see, now we see the Brockton sideline there.

1354
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:19,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Different zone there, that's what you needed.

1355
01:44:20,152 --> 01:44:23,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, now let's focus on defensive stops.

1356
01:44:24,915 --> 01:44:26,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it starts with good special team stops.

1357
01:44:27,496 --> 01:44:30,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week they gave up a touchdown, the opening kick to Franklin.

1358
01:44:30,877 --> 01:44:32,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight they gave up a 50 yard return.

1359
01:44:32,678 --> 01:44:39,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Now go on down and make a tackle, make Lincoln-Subbury, make plays and try to get your offense back on the field.

1360
01:44:40,441 --> 01:44:45,783
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of emotion here in the stands as they got the Boxer Faithful back into this football game.

1361
01:44:49,404 --> 01:44:50,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln-Subbury will send back.

1362
01:44:52,161 --> 01:44:54,802
[SPEAKER_00]: That return sent this crowd into a frenzy.

1363
01:44:55,903 --> 01:44:57,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like Siobhan Harris will be back there.

1364
01:45:08,407 --> 01:45:09,568
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Stavon Harris.

1365
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:20,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, again, Brock's defense hasn't really been that bad, it's just, they've started in great field position.

1366
01:45:20,843 --> 01:45:22,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's that.

1367
01:45:22,164 --> 01:45:23,585
[SPEAKER_00]: The run defense has been terrific.

1368
01:45:23,605 --> 01:45:26,227
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a couple broken plays with the quarterbacks, game yards.

1369
01:45:26,867 --> 01:45:33,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Defensively, and this happened last year too, there's been secondary breakdowns at the wrong time after playing quality football.

1370
01:45:33,491 --> 01:45:37,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know it's 17-7, but I would point my finger offensively.

1371
01:45:37,633 --> 01:45:40,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Defense has had two turnovers, you know?

1372
01:45:40,695 --> 01:45:45,760
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kick will go down to about the 12-yard line, and Lincoln-Subbery returns the ball.

1373
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:47,721
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of space, that's a good tackle.

1374
01:45:49,463 --> 01:45:51,064
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's number 13 for Brockton.

1375
01:45:51,665 --> 01:45:54,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, energy, they're bringing energy to the second half here.

1376
01:45:54,667 --> 01:45:55,308
[SPEAKER_01]: What a start.

1377
01:45:55,448 --> 01:46:01,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Ekamini-Akban, he had a bad penalty on the first half, but he comes down and makes up for it with a terrific tackle right there.

1378
01:46:03,755 --> 01:46:08,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln-Subbery will start at their own, 22 is Sean Landry, is he back into the game?

1379
01:46:09,604 --> 01:46:10,825
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw him on the bench.

1380
01:46:11,986 --> 01:46:12,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this tackle again.

1381
01:46:12,887 --> 01:46:13,648
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back in the game.

1382
01:46:13,668 --> 01:46:16,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice open field tackle.

1383
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:18,112
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll go in the pistol here.

1384
01:46:18,592 --> 01:46:20,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton remains in a 43 front.

1385
01:46:20,394 --> 01:46:22,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Lincoln Sudbury wants to do offensively.

1386
01:46:22,936 --> 01:46:24,417
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some success throwing the ball.

1387
01:46:26,679 --> 01:46:29,682
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back, he's looking to throw, he's looking to throw, he's over the middle and he's open.

1388
01:46:31,003 --> 01:46:35,626
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be a modest five yard game, as Brockton once again giving up the underneath stuff.

1389
01:46:35,666 --> 01:46:38,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just when you think Lincoln Sudbury's gonna run the ball, slow the game down, no.

1390
01:46:39,408 --> 01:46:40,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Come up chucking here.

1391
01:46:40,729 --> 01:46:45,592
[SPEAKER_00]: So a gain of six will make it second and four at the Brockton 29 and a half yard line.

1392
01:46:48,514 --> 01:46:51,036
[SPEAKER_00]: As Lincoln Sudbury taking advantage of the underneath stuff.

1393
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:58,341
[SPEAKER_01]: That play's been open all day.

1394
01:46:58,581 --> 01:47:00,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Landry remaining in the pistol.

1395
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:04,242
[SPEAKER_01]: See Luke Turco now pinching in a little.

1396
01:47:06,102 --> 01:47:06,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Under center.

1397
01:47:09,123 --> 01:47:10,104
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ball will go to the back.

1398
01:47:10,124 --> 01:47:11,664
[SPEAKER_00]: There shouldn't be a lot of room there, and they got him.

1399
01:47:12,344 --> 01:47:17,506
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a lot of success running the ball, and that's a nice tackle by the boxers.

1400
01:47:17,566 --> 01:47:20,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 42, Xavier Colon, the junior linebacker.

1401
01:47:21,087 --> 01:47:23,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Good athlete, physical linebacker.

1402
01:47:23,488 --> 01:47:25,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, went exactly for the legs.

1403
01:47:26,749 --> 01:47:29,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Was able to chop him down in a short game.

1404
01:47:30,093 --> 01:47:32,256
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe no game there.

1405
01:47:32,276 --> 01:47:35,079
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go third and four at the 30.

1406
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:37,743
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge play early in the second half for the Boxer defense.

1407
01:47:39,305 --> 01:47:41,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if Lincoln Subbery goes through the air here, Orlando.

1408
01:47:41,428 --> 01:47:43,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of success running the football.

1409
01:47:43,210 --> 01:47:48,236
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a big start for Brockton here.

1410
01:47:49,095 --> 01:47:52,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if Coach Shelby gets those corners up at the line of scrimmage.

1411
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,922
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit closer.

1412
01:47:54,962 --> 01:47:56,604
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been working them flats all game.

1413
01:47:57,144 --> 01:47:57,725
[SPEAKER_00]: In the pistol.

1414
01:47:58,146 --> 01:47:58,666
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back.

1415
01:47:58,806 --> 01:47:59,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry's got time.

1416
01:47:59,728 --> 01:48:00,208
[SPEAKER_00]: He has time.

1417
01:48:00,248 --> 01:48:00,749
[SPEAKER_00]: He throws it.

1418
01:48:01,329 --> 01:48:03,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, he has enough for the first down.

1419
01:48:04,293 --> 01:48:06,095
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice pitch and catch in the underneath stuff.

1420
01:48:06,135 --> 01:48:07,336
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be a penalty on Brockton.

1421
01:48:08,818 --> 01:48:09,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucky.

1422
01:48:09,977 --> 01:48:11,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, they missed that one, Leo.

1423
01:48:11,558 --> 01:48:13,539
[SPEAKER_01]: He hit that kid after the play.

1424
01:48:13,859 --> 01:48:16,080
[SPEAKER_00]: So Landry throws the ball underneath.

1425
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:21,482
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice six yard gain will give them a first down and take a little bit of the momentum away from Brockton.

1426
01:48:21,922 --> 01:48:24,143
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about a big, big, big pass.

1427
01:48:25,424 --> 01:48:26,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Just too much cushion.

1428
01:48:26,764 --> 01:48:28,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Just too much stuff underneath.

1429
01:48:29,226 --> 01:48:30,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Too easy of throws.

1430
01:48:31,927 --> 01:48:33,447
[SPEAKER_00]: So Landry will remain in the pistol.

1431
01:48:34,588 --> 01:48:37,449
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two H-backs and one back next to him.

1432
01:48:37,969 --> 01:48:38,890
[SPEAKER_00]: One receiver to the right.

1433
01:48:40,844 --> 01:48:42,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Now two backs next to Landry.

1434
01:48:42,824 --> 01:48:43,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ball will go to him.

1435
01:48:43,745 --> 01:48:46,325
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a little bit of space, he runs up the middle, and that's a good run.

1436
01:48:47,485 --> 01:48:48,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gains five yards.

1437
01:48:49,406 --> 01:48:49,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much.

1438
01:48:52,887 --> 01:48:55,507
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln Sudbury, exactly what they wanted.

1439
01:48:56,807 --> 01:49:03,189
[SPEAKER_00]: After that opening, electrifying kickoff by Jared Mighty, will gain five yards, a second and five at their own 42.

1440
01:49:03,589 --> 01:49:05,809
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at nine minutes of the second half of a 17-17, 17-7 LS lead.

1441
01:49:11,553 --> 01:49:12,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Landry.

1442
01:49:12,534 --> 01:49:15,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Landry has made great decisions tonight at quarterback.

1443
01:49:15,716 --> 01:49:17,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's been the best player on the field.

1444
01:49:18,678 --> 01:49:20,919
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the senior signal caller in the pistol.

1445
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,561
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got two H-backs and one back.

1446
01:49:24,722 --> 01:49:25,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Man in motion.

1447
01:49:26,203 --> 01:49:26,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Same play.

1448
01:49:27,664 --> 01:49:28,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, same play.

1449
01:49:29,505 --> 01:49:32,367
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got a good run, did gain three yards.

1450
01:49:33,027 --> 01:49:36,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Spun him backwards, and a tackle there, was that Zatz?

1451
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:40,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Nathan Jean-Baptiste along with Uriel Maybeam.

1452
01:49:41,509 --> 01:49:46,250
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sophomore nose tackle, Wade Mike Myers, or Michael Myers.

1453
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:51,991
[SPEAKER_00]: So third and two, another big play for the Boxer defense.

1454
01:49:54,291 --> 01:49:57,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect, you know, another handoff.

1455
01:49:58,932 --> 01:50:00,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Very short yardage to pick up.

1456
01:50:02,473 --> 01:50:05,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're missing a mob weakens tonight in the middle.

1457
01:50:05,213 --> 01:50:06,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch for the quarterback keeper here.

1458
01:50:07,334 --> 01:50:08,114
[SPEAKER_00]: So third and two.

1459
01:50:09,364 --> 01:50:13,227
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to third and one at the 44 and a half yard line.

1460
01:50:13,707 --> 01:50:14,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry and the pistol.

1461
01:50:15,008 --> 01:50:19,692
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna look to run the ball, and he has space, and the Brockton comes up and makes the tackle.

1462
01:50:20,212 --> 01:50:22,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke Turco, he'll stop him.

1463
01:50:22,674 --> 01:50:31,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, that was kinda like, you made a switch to the quarterback position, and I said, you know what, maybe they're gonna go quarterback keeper, and that's exactly what they did, and they lost a little there.

1464
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,462
[SPEAKER_00]: So, fourth and three, let's see what they do.

1465
01:50:34,522 --> 01:50:35,903
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they might go for it, Orlando.

1466
01:50:39,222 --> 01:50:41,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like they're keeping their offense on the field.

1467
01:50:41,583 --> 01:50:42,803
[SPEAKER_00]: They're talking to the quarterback.

1468
01:50:42,863 --> 01:50:44,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're gonna try to draw him off the sides.

1469
01:50:44,884 --> 01:50:46,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton's gonna have to show some discipline here.

1470
01:50:48,826 --> 01:50:51,767
[SPEAKER_00]: On a lot of their third downs, the short passing game's been effective.

1471
01:50:51,787 --> 01:50:52,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what they do here.

1472
01:50:52,707 --> 01:50:58,309
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't make this, they'll give Brockton terrific field position inside Lincoln-Subbury territory.

1473
01:50:58,929 --> 01:51:01,570
[SPEAKER_00]: So fourth and two, he's gonna be in the pistol.

1474
01:51:02,231 --> 01:51:04,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton got almost everyone in the box.

1475
01:51:07,593 --> 01:51:08,573
[SPEAKER_00]: He's making the hard count.

1476
01:51:11,079 --> 01:51:11,939
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they didn't jump.

1477
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:13,420
[SPEAKER_00]: They do go for it.

1478
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:14,020
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a snap.

1479
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:14,801
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get it.

1480
01:51:14,961 --> 01:51:15,701
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get it.

1481
01:51:15,941 --> 01:51:16,601
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get it.

1482
01:51:16,941 --> 01:51:19,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And what slowed that play down was the snap.

1483
01:51:19,863 --> 01:51:25,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if they were supposed to go on a different count, but it looked like the quarterback was ready for that ball.

1484
01:51:25,965 --> 01:51:30,667
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, junior linebacker Xavier Colon shooting the gap, getting in the backfield.

1485
01:51:32,578 --> 01:51:34,639
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying things in the backfield for a lot less.

1486
01:51:34,659 --> 01:51:35,720
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton now.

1487
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:36,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see the replay here.

1488
01:51:37,521 --> 01:51:39,202
[SPEAKER_01]: The snap, yeah, a little bit low.

1489
01:51:39,702 --> 01:51:41,723
[SPEAKER_01]: It was able to make a great play there now.

1490
01:51:42,063 --> 01:51:45,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton takes over and a big stop.

1491
01:51:45,525 --> 01:51:47,166
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the ball at the Lincoln Cemetery, 45.

1492
01:51:47,226 --> 01:51:51,428
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna come out with receivers on both sides.

1493
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:56,971
[SPEAKER_00]: With Luke Turco in the backfield.

1494
01:51:59,272 --> 01:52:00,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo in the pistol.

1495
01:52:03,490 --> 01:52:04,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're gonna go to Luke.

1496
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:06,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And Luke, there's nothing there.

1497
01:52:07,052 --> 01:52:07,832
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing there.

1498
01:52:08,713 --> 01:52:10,494
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton will lose two yards there.

1499
01:52:12,154 --> 01:52:17,697
[SPEAKER_00]: As Lincoln Sudbury's been undersized, but they have really done a nice job stopping Brockton's running game.

1500
01:52:17,717 --> 01:52:19,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, I feel like when Luke's in the game, they're running the ball.

1501
01:52:20,379 --> 01:52:22,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you gotta play chess here.

1502
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:26,522
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta try different things, you know, and come back to that.

1503
01:52:26,822 --> 01:52:28,943
[SPEAKER_00]: So a loss of two for Brockton will make it second and 12.

1504
01:52:29,784 --> 01:52:31,084
[SPEAKER_00]: The offense still stagnant.

1505
01:52:31,124 --> 01:52:32,105
[SPEAKER_00]: They gotta make some plays.

1506
01:52:33,173 --> 01:52:34,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Defense is giving them a chance here.

1507
01:52:36,695 --> 01:52:40,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo in the shotgun, pistol with Luke Turco next to him.

1508
01:52:41,137 --> 01:52:43,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Man in motion, that ball is faked, it's gonna go to Turco.

1509
01:52:43,799 --> 01:52:47,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco has room, Turco keeps running, Turco's gonna gain a first down.

1510
01:52:47,681 --> 01:52:49,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Good play call, Coach Barrows.

1511
01:52:49,542 --> 01:52:53,584
[SPEAKER_01]: That time they sent Jarrett in motion, they've been using that.

1512
01:52:53,685 --> 01:52:54,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Faked it.

1513
01:52:54,185 --> 01:52:57,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, faked it and it was able to give it to Luko and it got positive yards, great play call.

1514
01:52:58,327 --> 01:53:00,568
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna go first down, they're gonna move fast.

1515
01:53:00,688 --> 01:53:04,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton has the ball at the Lincoln-Subbury about a 37 yard line.

1516
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:06,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo the snap, the ball's gonna go to Turco.

1517
01:53:07,712 --> 01:53:09,192
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball, it's just starting too late.

1518
01:53:09,432 --> 01:53:10,353
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap isn't great.

1519
01:53:10,373 --> 01:53:11,093
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap's too high.

1520
01:53:11,153 --> 01:53:11,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's too high.

1521
01:53:12,074 --> 01:53:14,815
[SPEAKER_00]: The play's taking too much time to develop.

1522
01:53:14,975 --> 01:53:18,557
[SPEAKER_01]: That's happened a lot this year with Snapper and the quarterback.

1523
01:53:20,058 --> 01:53:22,539
[SPEAKER_01]: That senior Henry Hank Moss.

1524
01:53:22,839 --> 01:53:24,960
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have a delay, that play has to happen quick.

1525
01:53:25,835 --> 01:53:27,135
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's gonna be no game.

1526
01:53:27,155 --> 01:53:34,438
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna go second and 10 at the, looks like about the 33 and a half.

1527
01:53:35,778 --> 01:53:38,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Clark's running here, 541 here in the third quarter.

1528
01:53:38,419 --> 01:53:40,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Must touchdown right here, Orlando.

1529
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:41,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Changes the whole game.

1530
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:45,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo in the pistol.

1531
01:53:45,261 --> 01:53:46,941
[SPEAKER_00]: They got trips to the right, one to the left.

1532
01:53:47,362 --> 01:53:48,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turk goes to back.

1533
01:53:51,243 --> 01:53:51,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the snap.

1534
01:53:52,752 --> 01:53:54,273
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna get the ball in space to Mighty.

1535
01:53:54,353 --> 01:53:56,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Mighty with good blocking, and they're gonna get called for another penalty.

1536
01:53:57,736 --> 01:54:00,058
[SPEAKER_00]: He's blocking downfield before the play.

1537
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:04,001
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not good enough, Philando.

1538
01:54:04,021 --> 01:54:05,342
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make those mistakes.

1539
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:11,587
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton's gonna be pushed back 10 yards.

1540
01:54:12,328 --> 01:54:14,730
[SPEAKER_01]: They called holdin', they didn't call blockin' downfield.

1541
01:54:14,770 --> 01:54:16,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see that play again, though.

1542
01:54:18,073 --> 01:54:19,494
[SPEAKER_00]: If his hands are outside, it's a hold.

1543
01:54:22,492 --> 01:54:23,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see the play, let's see the play again.

1544
01:54:23,752 --> 01:54:25,853
[SPEAKER_00]: So another big play for the Boxers, call back.

1545
01:54:28,493 --> 01:54:31,234
[SPEAKER_00]: He's holding, his hands were outside, we saw it right there, his hands were outside.

1546
01:54:31,474 --> 01:54:32,874
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get called for that every time.

1547
01:54:33,455 --> 01:54:36,935
[SPEAKER_00]: So second and 16, the big play, call back.

1548
01:54:37,155 --> 01:54:38,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big penalty off a big play.

1549
01:54:41,076 --> 01:54:44,017
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna drive the coaches crazy, it's just inexcusable stuff.

1550
01:54:45,877 --> 01:54:47,758
[SPEAKER_00]: So trips to the left, one to the right.

1551
01:54:49,141 --> 01:54:50,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Samado back, Samado back.

1552
01:54:50,422 --> 01:54:51,523
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be the screen pass.

1553
01:54:51,983 --> 01:54:52,884
[SPEAKER_00]: What you were looking for.

1554
01:54:52,964 --> 01:54:58,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco's got a little bit of space and they'll gain about eight yards there and make it a manageable third down.

1555
01:54:58,889 --> 01:54:59,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Good play call.

1556
01:54:59,610 --> 01:55:00,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Good play call.

1557
01:55:00,651 --> 01:55:04,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been calling for that and they finally get my wish.

1558
01:55:05,174 --> 01:55:10,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach Colombo used to run that play to the fullback in the old days and it always seemed to go for 70 yard touchdown.

1559
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:13,802
[SPEAKER_00]: So third and six here for the Boxers.

1560
01:55:14,182 --> 01:55:16,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like it's definitely four down territory.

1561
01:55:17,663 --> 01:55:20,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo getting the call from Coach Barrows.

1562
01:55:21,066 --> 01:55:31,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco is the lone back, Mighty, Wooten, Rommel, Johnson, and Lucas, Jayden Lopes-Rivero.

1563
01:55:31,274 --> 01:55:38,140
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of time spilling from that scoreboard.

1564
01:55:39,161 --> 01:55:41,903
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go, big play, third and five for the Boxers.

1565
01:55:45,635 --> 01:55:48,756
[SPEAKER_00]: man in motion, the ball's faked, the ball, he's open there, he's got him if he catches it.

1566
01:55:49,116 --> 01:55:51,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Moves inside, moves outside, he breaks a tackle!

1567
01:55:52,037 --> 01:55:54,197
[SPEAKER_00]: And a great pitching catch to Rommel Johnson.

1568
01:55:54,317 --> 01:56:03,439
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great play call, again, they thought Luke was getting the ball, now I've said this, set up your run, set up your pass from your run, and that's what they did there.

1569
01:56:03,519 --> 01:56:13,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that back, that was Jaden Wooten, back from Randolph High, good athlete, played quarterback, makes the catch, broke a tackle, got the enough yardage to get the first down.

1570
01:56:14,302 --> 01:56:15,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton in the red zone.

1571
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:16,425
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.

1572
01:56:16,485 --> 01:56:18,487
[SPEAKER_00]: The boxers with a first down at about the 15.

1573
01:56:20,369 --> 01:56:21,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo in the pistol.

1574
01:56:21,411 --> 01:56:22,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turco the back next to him.

1575
01:56:23,413 --> 01:56:24,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Brockton move.

1576
01:56:25,315 --> 01:56:26,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh timeout.

1577
01:56:27,217 --> 01:56:29,080
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to use those timeouts too much.

1578
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:30,441
[SPEAKER_00]: You might need them later in the game.

1579
01:56:30,481 --> 01:56:32,484
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that's not something

1580
01:56:34,111 --> 01:56:35,413
[SPEAKER_00]: the coaches are happy about.

1581
01:56:35,533 --> 01:56:40,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see them go to the line, Leo, and move faster, just hand off the ball.

1582
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:45,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Lincoln Sudbury look like they're in their heels right now, they're looking like they're a little bit tired.

1583
01:56:45,645 --> 01:56:47,807
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of guys are playing both ways on that side.

1584
01:56:48,929 --> 01:56:54,095
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's something we talked about coming into the half that we're happy to see, a lot of emotion, physicality.

1585
01:56:55,174 --> 01:57:02,355
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing you see, the kids are playing for their coaches, because they easily could have came out and packed it in, lost this game 24 to seven and got ready for next week.

1586
01:57:02,995 --> 01:57:06,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see the boxers battle back in their second half, win or lose.

1587
01:57:07,196 --> 01:57:11,957
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton will have the ball at about the 15 yard line, they're down 17-7.

1588
01:57:12,397 --> 01:57:13,918
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at three minutes of the third quarter.

1589
01:57:13,978 --> 01:57:21,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo Genitasio, along with the Brockton legend Orlando Galvao, Brockton community actors, catch us on the Brockton channels.

1590
01:57:24,728 --> 01:57:27,709
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton will move right, looks like they're gonna go right to the line of scrimmage.

1591
01:57:27,749 --> 01:57:30,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury, defensive coordinator, getting the calls.

1592
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:34,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Coach Barrows has here.

1593
01:57:34,951 --> 01:57:37,091
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been creative so far in this drive.

1594
01:57:40,712 --> 01:57:43,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Samada remains in the pistol, two to the left, one.

1595
01:57:43,898 --> 01:57:44,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Two to the right.

1596
01:57:44,658 --> 01:57:47,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turco's the back, the man in motion.

1597
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:48,639
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's gonna go to Mighty.

1598
01:57:48,659 --> 01:57:49,579
[SPEAKER_00]: He tries to get to the outside.

1599
01:57:49,839 --> 01:57:50,879
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses some of that speed.

1600
01:57:51,139 --> 01:57:52,379
[SPEAKER_00]: He pumps it in, he cuts back in.

1601
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,460
[SPEAKER_00]: He cuts back, I'd like to see him protect that ball.

1602
01:57:55,580 --> 01:57:56,420
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a nice run.

1603
01:57:56,580 --> 01:57:58,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, using that speed.

1604
01:57:58,181 --> 01:57:59,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke Turco lead the way too.

1605
01:57:59,781 --> 01:58:02,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And an excellent tackle by Lincoln Sudbury, or else he was gonna go on the end zone.

1606
01:58:03,241 --> 01:58:05,042
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jared Mighty will gain about 11?

1607
01:58:10,083 --> 01:58:12,223
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton will have the ball with the five yard line.

1608
01:58:14,819 --> 01:58:17,760
[SPEAKER_00]: They were stagnant here last time, but they've been a little more creative.

1609
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Christian Flaherty goes into the game.

1610
01:58:20,021 --> 01:58:22,682
[SPEAKER_00]: The big fullback, the senior fullback, we're in the eye.

1611
01:58:23,362 --> 01:58:27,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Cimino gets the ball, Turco has a little bit of room, he punches inside, he gets in the end zone!

1612
01:58:27,043 --> 01:58:28,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the ball to Luke Turco!

1613
01:58:32,535 --> 01:58:35,557
[SPEAKER_00]: So that big offensive line pushes Lincoln's set very back.

1614
01:58:35,637 --> 01:58:40,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turco on a six yard touchdown run with the help of Christian Flaherty.

1615
01:58:40,139 --> 01:58:44,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like they did when Brockton went for it at midfield, they made Brockton pay.

1616
01:58:45,202 --> 01:58:49,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton returns the favor, making them pay for going for that fourth down and not making it.

1617
01:58:49,724 --> 01:58:51,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And Brockton back in this game.

1618
01:58:52,485 --> 01:58:55,287
[SPEAKER_00]: So Danny DaSilva, the kicker, will come in for the extra point.

1619
01:58:59,897 --> 01:59:02,805
[SPEAKER_00]: The hold down, the kick is good.

1620
01:59:03,949 --> 01:59:06,691
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at three minutes and nine seconds.

1621
01:59:06,711 --> 01:59:10,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton has battled themselves back into this football game.

1622
01:59:10,594 --> 01:59:11,695
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 17-14.

1623
01:59:12,436 --> 01:59:14,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, surprise, surprise.

1624
01:59:14,497 --> 01:59:17,700
[SPEAKER_01]: There might have been people out there watching Brockton.

1625
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:22,463
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the replay here, Luke Turco not messing around, taking it right in the end zone with authority.

1626
01:59:22,724 --> 01:59:30,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving over that left side of that Brockton line right there was really did a terrific job, starting with the center, Henry Hinkboss.

1627
01:59:32,395 --> 01:59:37,377
[SPEAKER_00]: It's number 77, the senior, Nathan Bertheny, 6'4", 365.

1628
01:59:38,438 --> 01:59:41,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Cash Pettway, 6'5", 404.

1629
01:59:41,479 --> 01:59:43,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, surprise, surprise.

1630
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:53,645
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of viewers out there watching probably gave up, turned away from the channel, but Brockton has come out a different team, and this is why we get frustrated, because we know what they're capable of doing.

1631
01:59:54,466 --> 01:59:56,227
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton will kick off here.

1632
01:59:56,607 --> 01:59:58,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury has three deep again.

1633
01:59:59,268 --> 02:00:00,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Danny DeSilvo looking to kick.

1634
02:00:01,815 --> 02:00:04,291
[SPEAKER_00]: The boxes are right back in this football game.

1635
02:00:04,311 --> 02:00:05,458
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of time left.

1636
02:00:19,047 --> 02:00:19,727
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good catch.

1637
02:00:19,787 --> 02:00:20,608
[SPEAKER_00]: It's angled to the right.

1638
02:00:20,648 --> 02:00:22,489
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's fielded about the six yard line.

1639
02:00:22,529 --> 02:00:23,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Brocklin's got guys down there.

1640
02:00:24,129 --> 02:00:25,170
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of space.

1641
02:00:25,430 --> 02:00:26,771
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are bouncing inside.

1642
02:00:27,091 --> 02:00:28,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's good tackling.

1643
02:00:28,231 --> 02:00:28,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

1644
02:00:28,391 --> 02:00:33,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Looked like that ball came a little loose, but he was able to... He had an outfield like a loaf of bread.

1645
02:00:36,665 --> 02:00:41,666
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers, defensively, have really ignited the Boxers' offense.

1646
02:00:42,286 --> 02:00:44,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see how Lincoln-Satterbury responds now.

1647
02:00:44,866 --> 02:00:46,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've been successful throwing the ball.

1648
02:00:46,887 --> 02:00:48,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Running the ball, not worked tonight for them.

1649
02:00:49,307 --> 02:00:50,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if they go back to it.

1650
02:00:50,507 --> 02:00:52,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Brockton to pinch Luke Turco.

1651
02:00:52,528 --> 02:00:54,868
[SPEAKER_01]: That quick pass has been working a lot today.

1652
02:00:54,888 --> 02:00:56,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see Luke Turco pinch a little bit in.

1653
02:00:57,109 --> 02:00:59,669
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boxer defense has been really solid this half.

1654
02:00:59,709 --> 02:01:04,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Spock by Xavier Colon, Luke Turco, and those big Brockton defensive ends.

1655
02:01:04,990 --> 02:01:06,390
[SPEAKER_01]: The crowd is on their feet now.

1656
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:10,151
[SPEAKER_01]: What a different turn of events here in the second half.

1657
02:01:11,391 --> 02:01:13,152
[SPEAKER_00]: So Landry will get into the shotgun.

1658
02:01:13,872 --> 02:01:17,253
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got one back to the right, three receivers right, one left.

1659
02:01:19,173 --> 02:01:19,853
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to throw.

1660
02:01:20,093 --> 02:01:20,513
[SPEAKER_00]: He's locked.

1661
02:01:20,533 --> 02:01:21,434
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of pressure.

1662
02:01:21,454 --> 02:01:22,954
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over the middle and he's wide open.

1663
02:01:24,834 --> 02:01:26,395
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be a 12-yard gain.

1664
02:01:26,595 --> 02:01:27,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great hit.

1665
02:01:28,808 --> 02:01:31,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of pass rush.

1666
02:01:31,609 --> 02:01:34,390
[SPEAKER_00]: No pass rush and just too many yards underneath Orlando.

1667
02:01:35,031 --> 02:01:36,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And that play's been working all night.

1668
02:01:37,772 --> 02:01:40,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And Lincoln Sudbury's not shying away from it.

1669
02:01:40,713 --> 02:01:41,614
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going right to it.

1670
02:01:44,495 --> 02:01:51,418
[SPEAKER_00]: So a first down, a 14 yard completion as Lincoln Sudbury calms the Brockton crowd a bit.

1671
02:01:52,418 --> 02:01:55,339
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at the two minute mark of this third quarter, 17-14 game.

1672
02:01:57,631 --> 02:01:58,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry remains in the pistol.

1673
02:01:59,452 --> 02:02:02,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Brock remains in the 43 front with two safeties back.

1674
02:02:03,594 --> 02:02:04,515
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap, and he's back.

1675
02:02:04,555 --> 02:02:08,697
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking, he's looking, he's looking, he's looking, and he's, oh, it should be intercepted!

1676
02:02:08,777 --> 02:02:09,718
[SPEAKER_00]: It is intercepted!

1677
02:02:10,178 --> 02:02:10,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, it bounced.

1678
02:02:11,699 --> 02:02:13,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like Mighty had it, but it bounced.

1679
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:15,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know what?

1680
02:02:15,441 --> 02:02:17,862
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see the replay on that, but that looked like a dip bounce.

1681
02:02:17,882 --> 02:02:19,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that would've been huge.

1682
02:02:19,083 --> 02:02:20,223
[SPEAKER_00]: That would've been huge.

1683
02:02:20,744 --> 02:02:21,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see in the replay.

1684
02:02:21,784 --> 02:02:25,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Both refs came in right away and said it bounced, and Jared Mighty's not arguing.

1685
02:02:25,466 --> 02:02:26,747
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna see the replay here.

1686
02:02:27,837 --> 02:02:29,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Landry back to pass, steps into it.

1687
02:02:31,379 --> 02:02:32,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a good shot here, good angle.

1688
02:02:32,940 --> 02:02:34,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it bounced, it bounced.

1689
02:02:35,441 --> 02:02:38,402
[SPEAKER_00]: So, second and 10, the near turnover.

1690
02:02:38,522 --> 02:02:40,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if Lincoln Sudbury will run the ball here.

1691
02:02:43,765 --> 02:02:48,828
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boxer defense trying to come up with another big stop, get the ball back to the offense.

1692
02:02:50,929 --> 02:02:54,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury has three to the, looks like the right, one to the left.

1693
02:02:56,187 --> 02:02:58,369
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lone back in the backfield.

1694
02:02:58,689 --> 02:03:05,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry gets the ball, they're looking to throw again, they're looking to throw again, he's looking, he's got the wheel right, he's open, and he catches it.

1695
02:03:08,177 --> 02:03:08,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Good play.

1696
02:03:09,178 --> 02:03:11,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Good play call, good execution.

1697
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:17,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you right now, Lincoln Sudbury's not playing like a team that's very young.

1698
02:03:17,344 --> 02:03:23,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got the ball to the senior kicker, Marcus Cassell, who took it in, and the tackle by Brock is number five who was beat on the play.

1699
02:03:25,283 --> 02:03:28,325
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's Jordan DiPina, the outside linebacker on the wheel route.

1700
02:03:28,345 --> 02:03:40,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you gotta give the Lincoln Sudbury head coach, whoever made that play call, credit for that one, because they faked that curl to number 21, and he was able to hit him on the sideline for a great pass and catch.

1701
02:03:40,752 --> 02:03:42,613
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln Sudbury's taking back some momentum.

1702
02:03:42,633 --> 02:03:44,994
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the ball at the Brockton 40, first down.

1703
02:03:45,915 --> 02:03:48,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Two minutes left of this third quarter in a 17-14 game.

1704
02:03:51,715 --> 02:03:52,615
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still throwing.

1705
02:03:52,635 --> 02:03:53,376
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not having a lot.

1706
02:03:53,436 --> 02:03:54,036
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking to throw.

1707
02:03:54,056 --> 02:03:54,656
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking to throw.

1708
02:03:54,696 --> 02:03:55,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's open again.

1709
02:03:55,397 --> 02:03:55,957
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is, 21.

1710
02:03:56,517 --> 02:03:57,138
[SPEAKER_00]: He's open again.

1711
02:03:57,158 --> 02:03:58,498
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1712
02:03:58,578 --> 02:03:58,838
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1713
02:03:59,058 --> 02:04:00,519
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to put the brakes on that right now.

1714
02:04:01,299 --> 02:04:02,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll play it down for Brockton.

1715
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:03,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I know who that is.

1716
02:04:03,981 --> 02:04:04,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Jordan Topino.

1717
02:04:05,621 --> 02:04:08,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't afford to lose him because you've already short a linebacker.

1718
02:04:09,962 --> 02:04:13,408
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a star, Ahmaud Wiggins, a starter out for today's game.

1719
02:04:13,709 --> 02:04:15,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just playing pitch and catch right now.

1720
02:04:15,632 --> 02:04:18,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton's really not sending many, and they're sitting in the zone.

1721
02:04:18,757 --> 02:04:21,582
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at Sudbury just throwing the ball to spots in the zone.

1722
02:04:22,331 --> 02:04:24,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like he got hit in the head and hopefully he's gonna be okay.

1723
02:04:25,372 --> 02:04:35,494
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln Sebre has gotten the ball back here after Brockton took back the momentum and has gone right down the field on four plays and has gotten the ball at least into field goal territory for Marcus Cassell.

1724
02:04:35,634 --> 02:04:37,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this Landry kid is a problem.

1725
02:04:37,514 --> 02:04:39,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's just making dimes.

1726
02:04:39,055 --> 02:04:40,775
[SPEAKER_01]: He's out there throwing dimes out there.

1727
02:04:41,215 --> 02:04:44,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Every big play you need, he's answered it.

1728
02:04:44,956 --> 02:04:46,736
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton's a little thin at linebacker.

1729
02:04:48,377 --> 02:04:50,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Coach Shelby goes through here.

1730
02:04:55,889 --> 02:04:58,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like number 30 coming into the game for the Boxers.

1731
02:05:00,952 --> 02:05:06,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Sophomore, Wilma Perelian, and he'll get some varsity reps here in a big game.

1732
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:17,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Subberry, once again, they ran out to a 17-nothing halftime lead.

1733
02:05:18,224 --> 02:05:24,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton took the opening kickoff of the second half on a 90-odd kickoff return by Jared Mighty.

1734
02:05:25,983 --> 02:05:39,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton got a fourth down stop in midfield, turned that into a five yard Luke Turco run, but Lincoln Subbury's come right back on four plays and got the ball down to the Brockton 29, as hopefully Jordan DePino's okay.

1735
02:05:39,686 --> 02:05:42,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he looked like he might've got the wind knocked out of him, Leo.

1736
02:05:42,427 --> 02:05:43,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that's it.

1737
02:05:44,387 --> 02:05:46,888
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a head injury, he will be gone for at least a week.

1738
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:48,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton doesn't need that.

1739
02:05:49,889 --> 02:05:52,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sophomore linebacker will fill the spot there.

1740
02:05:52,409 --> 02:05:54,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if Lincoln Subbury tries to take advantage of that.

1741
02:05:55,630 --> 02:05:57,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it looked like he's shaking his head, Leo.

1742
02:05:57,231 --> 02:05:58,252
[SPEAKER_01]: You might've been right.

1743
02:06:00,053 --> 02:06:04,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought... So here we go.

1744
02:06:04,395 --> 02:06:06,296
[SPEAKER_00]: First down for the Warriors.

1745
02:06:07,917 --> 02:06:11,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry in the pistol, trips to the right with one back.

1746
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:15,462
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back, he racks, he's gonna run a little option.

1747
02:06:15,922 --> 02:06:17,663
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's pitched and it's just too many odds.

1748
02:06:17,743 --> 02:06:18,924
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a holding call right there.

1749
02:06:18,944 --> 02:06:20,925
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get a hold, but again, just too many odds.

1750
02:06:21,545 --> 02:06:24,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, too many odds because, you know,

1751
02:06:25,592 --> 02:06:28,637
[SPEAKER_01]: That lineman just pulled down one of our defenders.

1752
02:06:29,418 --> 02:06:31,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, are they gonna call it?

1753
02:06:31,981 --> 02:06:34,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Face mask on, that's a 15 yard penalty.

1754
02:06:34,345 --> 02:06:36,027
[SPEAKER_01]: He just pulled him down now.

1755
02:06:36,047 --> 02:06:39,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 15 yard penalty will put the ball back to about the...

1756
02:06:43,507 --> 02:06:44,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a 15-yarder, Lando?

1757
02:06:45,468 --> 02:06:46,609
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a 15-yarder.

1758
02:06:46,869 --> 02:06:50,311
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge penalty for Lincoln Sudbury.

1759
02:06:50,351 --> 02:06:52,332
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball will go back to about the 43, I believe.

1760
02:06:52,953 --> 02:06:53,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1761
02:06:53,293 --> 02:06:54,554
[SPEAKER_00]: About the 43 and a half.

1762
02:06:54,974 --> 02:06:56,315
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and 25.

1763
02:06:56,715 --> 02:06:58,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton with a huge chance to get off the field here.

1764
02:06:58,996 --> 02:07:00,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get the ball back with a chance to take the lead.

1765
02:07:00,998 --> 02:07:01,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1766
02:07:01,198 --> 02:07:06,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Where Brockton was committing these penalties that was costing him some yards, now Lincoln Sudbury is doing the same thing.

1767
02:07:06,641 --> 02:07:07,922
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had some penalties tonight, too.

1768
02:07:09,455 --> 02:07:11,656
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully Brockton can make this stop here.

1769
02:07:11,876 --> 02:07:15,298
[SPEAKER_00]: So Landry will go into the pistol again, no change into the offense.

1770
02:07:15,718 --> 02:07:17,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Two to the left, two to the right, one back.

1771
02:07:17,819 --> 02:07:20,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton sits in that 43 with both safeties back.

1772
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:22,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry with the man in motion.

1773
02:07:23,141 --> 02:07:26,483
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball goes back, he's gonna look to throw, he's gonna look to throw, he's got a man over.

1774
02:07:26,683 --> 02:07:27,763
[SPEAKER_00]: That ball could be intercepted.

1775
02:07:28,984 --> 02:07:31,245
[SPEAKER_00]: So good coverage by Antoine right there.

1776
02:07:31,445 --> 02:07:33,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent coverage and a little bit thrown to the,

1777
02:07:34,817 --> 02:07:37,478
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the range of the receiver, had no chance of catching the ball.

1778
02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:41,781
[SPEAKER_00]: So Antoine, after being beat once tonight, has had real blanket coverage since then.

1779
02:07:42,781 --> 02:07:44,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing real mental toughness.

1780
02:07:45,563 --> 02:07:54,448
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 2nd and 25, Brockton takes out Jaden Seal and bring in one of the quicker ends, Antoine Hart.

1781
02:07:54,548 --> 02:07:55,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Alon Hart, I'm sorry.

1782
02:07:55,588 --> 02:07:56,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch out for the screen here.

1783
02:07:56,989 --> 02:07:57,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch out for the screen.

1784
02:07:58,089 --> 02:08:00,831
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 2nd and 25, let's see what Lincoln Sudbury has in.

1785
02:08:00,851 --> 02:08:02,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton brings the safeties up a bit.

1786
02:08:02,832 --> 02:08:04,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Xavier Colon switches sides.

1787
02:08:06,158 --> 02:08:08,139
[SPEAKER_00]: with the sophomore linebacker.

1788
02:08:08,279 --> 02:08:10,940
[SPEAKER_01]: 21's been open all day for DeCanto.

1789
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:13,862
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back, he's back, Brockton's bringing pressure, Brockton's bringing pressure.

1790
02:08:14,202 --> 02:08:16,523
[SPEAKER_00]: It's caught and there's no game there, basically nothing.

1791
02:08:16,863 --> 02:08:19,625
[SPEAKER_00]: So John Shelby, I like what he did right there.

1792
02:08:20,365 --> 02:08:23,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta get the quarterback off his mark, put a little pressure on him, quicken him up a little bit.

1793
02:08:24,127 --> 02:08:27,008
[SPEAKER_00]: He does that, completes the pass, but it's basically no game.

1794
02:08:27,849 --> 02:08:33,472
[SPEAKER_00]: So third down to 25, you wanna see Brockton show a little discipline here, no silly penalties.

1795
02:08:35,925 --> 02:08:39,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Big third down coming up here, and a third down a very, very, very long.

1796
02:08:40,087 --> 02:08:41,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Sainties will be back a bit.

1797
02:08:42,809 --> 02:08:44,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Lincoln Sudbury has in.

1798
02:08:44,429 --> 02:08:48,852
[SPEAKER_00]: They try to want to get this ball into field goal range, which for their guy could be anywhere at the 35.

1799
02:08:49,892 --> 02:08:50,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say yes.

1800
02:08:54,194 --> 02:08:58,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry's back, Brock is putting pressure, they're bringing guys, he's got hit, there's the ball, that ball's intercepted!

1801
02:08:59,117 --> 02:08:59,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he dropped it.

1802
02:09:00,497 --> 02:09:01,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he dropped it.

1803
02:09:02,235 --> 02:09:04,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in... And there was space.

1804
02:09:04,916 --> 02:09:05,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in Antoine's hands.

1805
02:09:05,476 --> 02:09:06,397
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no one there.

1806
02:09:06,837 --> 02:09:07,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't corral it.

1807
02:09:08,017 --> 02:09:10,618
[SPEAKER_00]: He might have gone the whole way right there.

1808
02:09:10,638 --> 02:09:12,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what he was thinking, Leo.

1809
02:09:12,699 --> 02:09:15,760
[SPEAKER_01]: All he saw was open field and unfortunately you gotta catch the ball first.

1810
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:17,240
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here, we're gonna see it on the replay.

1811
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:18,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton bringing pressure again.

1812
02:09:18,881 --> 02:09:19,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry threw the ball.

1813
02:09:19,941 --> 02:09:20,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.

1814
02:09:21,962 --> 02:09:23,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there was... That would have been... So...

1815
02:09:25,518 --> 02:09:27,440
[SPEAKER_00]: The missed opportunity, still fourth down.

1816
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:29,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury with the punter out there.

1817
02:09:29,882 --> 02:09:32,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton will get the ball back with a chance to take the lead.

1818
02:09:32,364 --> 02:09:35,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And a dangerous serve and mighty back deep for Brockton.

1819
02:09:35,107 --> 02:09:37,970
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 26 seconds, and there's the kick, and it's a good one.

1820
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:39,031
[SPEAKER_00]: It's angled towards the sideline.

1821
02:09:39,051 --> 02:09:39,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I would let it go.

1822
02:09:39,651 --> 02:09:40,272
[SPEAKER_00]: I would let it go.

1823
02:09:40,732 --> 02:09:42,214
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's out at about the one, I believe.

1824
02:09:42,734 --> 02:09:43,675
[SPEAKER_01]: What a kick, what a kick.

1825
02:09:43,695 --> 02:09:44,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, Brockton will get the touch back.

1826
02:09:45,016 --> 02:09:46,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was a really good kick.

1827
02:09:46,658 --> 02:09:47,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton might've caught a break there.

1828
02:09:47,539 --> 02:09:48,900
[SPEAKER_00]: It did, it looked like it went out at the one.

1829
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:49,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1830
02:09:49,981 --> 02:09:51,761
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brock will get the ball and the touch back.

1831
02:09:51,981 --> 02:09:55,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I gotta see that again, but it looked like that ball bounced out at the 1.

1832
02:10:00,383 --> 02:10:02,904
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go Orlando, the boxers get the ball back.

1833
02:10:02,924 --> 02:10:04,144
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't said this all night.

1834
02:10:04,164 --> 02:10:07,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's leave the replay here first on that kick.

1835
02:10:09,945 --> 02:10:11,305
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can get a quick look at this.

1836
02:10:17,747 --> 02:10:18,847
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kick looked like

1837
02:10:20,185 --> 02:10:21,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we don't have a great angle at it.

1838
02:10:21,566 --> 02:10:22,627
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good call.

1839
02:10:22,907 --> 02:10:23,547
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good call.

1840
02:10:23,567 --> 02:10:24,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think it went out at the one.

1841
02:10:24,648 --> 02:10:25,989
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, that ball, that ball.

1842
02:10:26,069 --> 02:10:27,069
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they marked it at the one.

1843
02:10:27,650 --> 02:10:28,350
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed the call.

1844
02:10:28,370 --> 02:10:28,871
[SPEAKER_00]: It went out at the one.

1845
02:10:28,891 --> 02:10:29,431
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I thought.

1846
02:10:29,471 --> 02:10:30,071
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good call.

1847
02:10:30,692 --> 02:10:32,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton at the 1-1 yard line.

1848
02:10:33,614 --> 02:10:35,035
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tomato will keep the ball, keep the ball.

1849
02:10:35,055 --> 02:10:35,615
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, there you go.

1850
02:10:35,635 --> 02:10:36,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Move his legs, move his legs.

1851
02:10:36,956 --> 02:10:37,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.

1852
02:10:38,397 --> 02:10:39,317
[SPEAKER_00]: That would end the quarter, too.

1853
02:10:39,457 --> 02:10:41,139
[SPEAKER_00]: That was initially called a touchback.

1854
02:10:42,119 --> 02:10:44,561
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other ref came in and correctly made the call.

1855
02:10:46,187 --> 02:10:51,068
[SPEAKER_00]: He cornered, he got there right at the corner of the end zone, right at the one yard line.

1856
02:10:52,669 --> 02:10:57,810
[SPEAKER_01]: My initial thought, it went out, I thought we got a break and it went out, but we don't get breaks.

1857
02:10:57,971 --> 02:10:58,131
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1858
02:10:58,491 --> 02:10:59,031
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get breaks.

1859
02:10:59,131 --> 02:11:06,713
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of three quarters at Rocky Marciano Stadium on the campus of Brockton High School, Lincoln Subbury 17, Brockton 14.

1860
02:11:07,033 --> 02:11:12,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton calling back to this game.

1861
02:11:32,923 --> 02:11:36,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Third quarter score in Brockton was down 17-0.

1862
02:11:36,807 --> 02:11:38,028
[SPEAKER_00]: They took the opening kickoff.

1863
02:11:38,048 --> 02:11:42,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Jared Mighty went 90 yards and took it to the house to make it 17-7.

1864
02:11:43,032 --> 02:11:45,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton got a fourth down stop in midfield.

1865
02:11:45,515 --> 02:11:48,797
[SPEAKER_00]: They marched 50 yards on a Luke Turco five yard touchdown pass.

1866
02:11:49,178 --> 02:11:54,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury came back, got to the Brockton 29, but Brockton defense stiffened once again.

1867
02:11:54,022 --> 02:11:58,066
[SPEAKER_00]: A great kick resulted in Brockton having second down at the four yard line.

1868
02:11:58,246 --> 02:12:08,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, Leo, the defense hasn't been playing that bad, but if your offense can generate some scores, keep the defense off the field, your defense can make stops for you.

1869
02:12:08,769 --> 02:12:11,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, we're starting deep in our territory.

1870
02:12:11,910 --> 02:12:15,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Might wanna get a little room here, get a couple first downs.

1871
02:12:15,731 --> 02:12:16,352
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be nice.

1872
02:12:17,052 --> 02:12:22,213
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton's looking at a second and seven at the four.

1873
02:12:22,654 --> 02:12:23,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turk goes to back.

1874
02:12:25,054 --> 02:12:28,357
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Christian Flaherty in as Brockton starts in the eye.

1875
02:12:33,662 --> 02:12:34,784
[SPEAKER_00]: And Turco will get the ball.

1876
02:12:34,824 --> 02:12:36,045
[SPEAKER_00]: He has space, he gets up the middle.

1877
02:12:36,245 --> 02:12:36,866
[SPEAKER_00]: There he goes!

1878
02:12:37,146 --> 02:12:37,967
[SPEAKER_00]: There goes Turco!

1879
02:12:38,227 --> 02:12:38,848
[SPEAKER_00]: He has room!

1880
02:12:39,168 --> 02:12:40,189
[SPEAKER_00]: He breaks the tackle!

1881
02:12:41,250 --> 02:12:43,472
[SPEAKER_00]: And he will go 45 yards up to the 45!

1882
02:12:44,633 --> 02:12:47,316
[SPEAKER_00]: And Luke Sykes feed me the ball!

1883
02:12:48,877 --> 02:12:49,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow!

1884
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:54,062
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one tackle away from going 95 yards.

1885
02:12:54,582 --> 02:12:56,924
[SPEAKER_00]: When was the last time I brought him back when 95 yards?

1886
02:12:56,984 --> 02:12:58,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're looking at Lincoln Sudbury.

1887
02:12:58,485 --> 02:12:59,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Richard Johnson.

1888
02:12:59,246 --> 02:13:04,069
[SPEAKER_01]: The heads are turning right now because they're clearly seeing a different team here in the second half.

1889
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:10,293
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers will have a first down at the Lincoln Sudbury 48.

1890
02:13:10,633 --> 02:13:14,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great save and tackle that time too.

1891
02:13:15,457 --> 02:13:17,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see Casey Rhodes in.

1892
02:13:20,528 --> 02:13:26,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Brockton, I would like to see that play right into the line, wasting no time, keeping them off balance.

1893
02:13:27,994 --> 02:13:28,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking too long.

1894
02:13:29,496 --> 02:13:32,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Cimino gets the call, Brockton's gonna go quads again.

1895
02:13:32,458 --> 02:13:33,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey Rhodes is the lone back.

1896
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:36,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury's got just about everyone near that box.

1897
02:13:37,262 --> 02:13:39,124
[SPEAKER_00]: There goes the motion, the ball's gonna go to Mighty.

1898
02:13:39,364 --> 02:13:40,505
[SPEAKER_00]: He tries to get it to the outside.

1899
02:13:40,745 --> 02:13:44,128
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses that speed, he gets upfield and he gains about four yards.

1900
02:13:44,148 --> 02:13:45,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury was ready for that one.

1901
02:13:45,409 --> 02:13:48,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a good play, they stiffed that out, but he still was able to get a couple.

1902
02:13:50,566 --> 02:13:51,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe.

1903
02:13:52,788 --> 02:13:55,490
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton gains about a yard and a half.

1904
02:13:56,131 --> 02:13:59,874
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going second and nine at the Lincoln-Subbury 47.

1905
02:14:00,955 --> 02:14:01,315
[SPEAKER_00]: K.C.

1906
02:14:01,355 --> 02:14:02,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhodes remains in.

1907
02:14:02,316 --> 02:14:06,559
[SPEAKER_00]: K.C.

1908
02:14:06,599 --> 02:14:07,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhodes remains in.

1909
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:16,808
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four receivers with Semedo back there as he gets to signing.

1910
02:14:17,687 --> 02:14:18,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Talks to the receivers.

1911
02:14:18,587 --> 02:14:21,968
[SPEAKER_01]: The one and only Nubia just stepped into the press box, guys.

1912
02:14:22,608 --> 02:14:24,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sure Brockton knows who he is.

1913
02:14:26,309 --> 02:14:27,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo, once again, motion.

1914
02:14:28,250 --> 02:14:32,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the fake, he has time, he has time, he looks, he's low and deep, he has a receiver!

1915
02:14:37,132 --> 02:14:43,654
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like that play, I like that play, but... Did he have a chance to dive for it?

1916
02:14:46,838 --> 02:14:51,839
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball looked like it was there, maybe a little overthrown, but a good throw either way.

1917
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:54,580
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brock into the third and nine.

1918
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:55,860
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see that play to Lopes.

1919
02:14:55,960 --> 02:15:09,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that play, but I would just like to see that play to Lopes, because I feel like, you know, Lopes, no knock on Wooten, but Lopes goes out there and gets it, but I felt like that was catchable.

1920
02:15:10,904 --> 02:15:12,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see it right here on the replay.

1921
02:15:13,325 --> 02:15:14,385
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball was thrown and

1922
02:15:17,547 --> 02:15:18,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Play maybe could have been made.

1923
02:15:19,208 --> 02:15:20,889
[SPEAKER_00]: So third down and nine.

1924
02:15:20,950 --> 02:15:24,012
[SPEAKER_00]: The box is in the pistol.

1925
02:15:24,532 --> 02:15:25,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Cimino back, Cimino back.

1926
02:15:26,113 --> 02:15:26,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Throws it over the middle.

1927
02:15:27,534 --> 02:15:28,835
[SPEAKER_00]: But not enough.

1928
02:15:28,855 --> 02:15:30,817
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that play on second down.

1929
02:15:30,857 --> 02:15:32,078
[SPEAKER_00]: That ball on third down.

1930
02:15:32,638 --> 02:15:33,979
[SPEAKER_00]: So the box is made punt here.

1931
02:15:33,999 --> 02:15:37,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe try to box Lincoln Sudbury in.

1932
02:15:38,483 --> 02:15:41,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to give them the ball back at the 45 at fourth and seven.

1933
02:15:42,165 --> 02:15:43,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, looks like they're gonna punt.

1934
02:15:43,426 --> 02:15:44,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you punt here.

1935
02:15:44,107 --> 02:15:45,408
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of football left.

1936
02:15:45,448 --> 02:15:46,829
[SPEAKER_00]: The defense has played well enough.

1937
02:15:48,077 --> 02:15:52,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully Mighty can do exactly what Brockton just did.

1938
02:15:52,742 --> 02:15:57,146
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton got out of their own two yard, one yard line, crossed midfield.

1939
02:15:57,587 --> 02:16:02,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like instead of Mighty putting the ball, you got someone else putting the ball now, the field goal kicker for Brockton.

1940
02:16:02,612 --> 02:16:03,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Danny DaSilva.

1941
02:16:05,254 --> 02:16:06,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Give Mighty a break.

1942
02:16:08,278 --> 02:16:09,218
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap's perfect.

1943
02:16:09,419 --> 02:16:10,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Danny DaSilva.

1944
02:16:10,973 --> 02:16:11,593
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good kick.

1945
02:16:12,294 --> 02:16:15,055
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna get down, they're gonna let it bounce, let it bounce, let it bounce.

1946
02:16:15,575 --> 02:16:18,496
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a terrific kick that will stop inside the 10 yard line.

1947
02:16:18,536 --> 02:16:20,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good kick, good bounce.

1948
02:16:20,637 --> 02:16:24,018
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what you want for Brockton if you're gonna punt it.

1949
02:16:24,238 --> 02:16:27,600
[SPEAKER_01]: You want exactly that situation right there.

1950
02:16:28,677 --> 02:16:33,078
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at the nine minute, 20 seconds of the fourth quarter.

1951
02:16:33,798 --> 02:16:41,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton Community Access, Brockton Channels catchers, Leo Genitassio, along with the legend, Orlando Galveo.

1952
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:48,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we have Mike the Postman-Simmons, Curtis Reese, and Scott LaBoussiere on the production tonight.

1953
02:16:49,962 --> 02:16:52,282
[SPEAKER_00]: As the boxers look to try to make another start here.

1954
02:16:52,982 --> 02:16:55,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury, let's see if they throw the ball inside their own tent.

1955
02:17:01,267 --> 02:17:03,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry, he's gonna huddle up this time.

1956
02:17:05,112 --> 02:17:07,575
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll remain, it looks like, in the pistol with one back.

1957
02:17:10,118 --> 02:17:13,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton has got everyone in the box, but one safety.

1958
02:17:13,542 --> 02:17:14,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco back with one corner.

1959
02:17:17,607 --> 02:17:20,631
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the call, he fakes it, there's a good call, that's a great play call.

1960
02:17:22,162 --> 02:17:26,323
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's gonna gain, that's just exactly what you need to do inside your own 20.

1961
02:17:26,744 --> 02:17:34,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Great play call, it's a reverse, an option reverse by the quarterback, and it gains about seven yards to tackle by Luke Turco, gain of eight.

1962
02:17:36,167 --> 02:17:38,807
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a perfect call, Leland, to inside your own 10 yard line.

1963
02:17:38,827 --> 02:17:41,208
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of plays in their arsenals.

1964
02:17:43,169 --> 02:17:48,351
[SPEAKER_00]: They remind me a lot of Franklin on offense, they run their plays, but they run them effectively, they block them well.

1965
02:17:51,145 --> 02:17:59,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be second and two at the 16 yard line, under nine minutes of a 17-14 game.

1966
02:18:01,331 --> 02:18:05,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry, he's done just about everything for this team tonight.

1967
02:18:05,814 --> 02:18:08,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Open field tackles, touchdown throws, runs.

1968
02:18:09,096 --> 02:18:09,997
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got one back.

1969
02:18:13,419 --> 02:18:13,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion.

1970
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:17,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's the same exact call.

1971
02:18:21,798 --> 02:18:25,940
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's another option reverse for six yards.

1972
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:28,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nothing fancy, but it's working.

1973
02:18:29,461 --> 02:18:33,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Brockton defensive end has gotta contain and it's just a good play call.

1974
02:18:34,323 --> 02:18:37,184
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first down and Lincoln-Subbury gets out of trouble.

1975
02:18:37,724 --> 02:18:42,446
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at the 24 at first down and 10.

1976
02:18:42,986 --> 02:18:45,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Two real good play calls by Lincoln-Subbury there.

1977
02:18:45,887 --> 02:18:49,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two O and O, O and two teams tonight battling it out in the field.

1978
02:18:50,904 --> 02:18:54,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Both teams know this could be a big loss for either team, so.

1979
02:18:55,226 --> 02:18:57,187
[SPEAKER_00]: This could have playoff implications, point-wise.

1980
02:18:57,747 --> 02:19:02,269
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's the call, there's the ball in the back.

1981
02:19:02,349 --> 02:19:04,010
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a little bit of room, that's a good tackle.

1982
02:19:04,130 --> 02:19:09,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Ty Baker, Ty Baker with a little help from, it's good to see Jordan Tapina back in there.

1983
02:19:10,213 --> 02:19:12,454
[SPEAKER_00]: So a gain of two will make it second and eight.

1984
02:19:21,822 --> 02:19:23,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Landry gets the call from the coach.

1985
02:19:28,004 --> 02:19:29,344
[SPEAKER_00]: That's head coach Justin McKay.

1986
02:19:29,364 --> 02:19:31,344
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a fine job at Lincoln-Subbury at school.

1987
02:19:31,364 --> 02:19:35,085
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really every sport there just about.

1988
02:19:36,226 --> 02:19:36,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 25%.

1989
02:19:36,826 --> 02:19:37,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good.

1990
02:19:37,326 --> 02:19:39,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical kids, they're good at everything.

1991
02:19:39,486 --> 02:19:39,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly helps.

1992
02:19:40,727 --> 02:19:44,308
[SPEAKER_00]: So, second and nine.

1993
02:19:44,388 --> 02:19:45,108
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the pistol.

1994
02:19:46,929 --> 02:19:49,590
[SPEAKER_00]: from the shotgun, he's gonna throw, he's gonna throw, he's gonna throw.

1995
02:19:49,870 --> 02:19:50,810
[SPEAKER_00]: He throws it over the middle.

1996
02:19:51,211 --> 02:19:52,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, caught and a mistackle.

1997
02:19:54,272 --> 02:19:55,112
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be a penalty.

1998
02:19:56,112 --> 02:19:57,733
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a hit in the back, that's coming back.

1999
02:19:58,213 --> 02:20:01,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, he didn't even need to do that.

2000
02:20:02,335 --> 02:20:05,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Harris didn't even need to do that.

2001
02:20:05,856 --> 02:20:09,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the play was wide open and the mistackle would have been a 20 yard gain.

2002
02:20:09,657 --> 02:20:11,178
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lincoln-Subbery's gotta go back.

2003
02:20:11,218 --> 02:20:12,899
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had just as many penalties as Brockton.

2004
02:20:13,179 --> 02:20:15,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know what Harris was thinking there.

2005
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:19,661
[SPEAKER_01]: was completely away from the play, hit in the back.

2006
02:20:21,481 --> 02:20:22,662
[SPEAKER_00]: So that play was upfield.

2007
02:20:22,682 --> 02:20:25,843
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be probably the same exact, second and nine, no real change.

2008
02:20:26,763 --> 02:20:28,583
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball was caught at the first down marker.

2009
02:20:28,723 --> 02:20:32,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton fortunate not to give up 20 yards.

2010
02:20:32,485 --> 02:20:34,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that play's been open all game though.

2011
02:20:35,345 --> 02:20:40,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, every time you need a bread and butter play, it seems like they're going to that exact play.

2012
02:20:40,787 --> 02:20:43,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Defensively, you gotta wake up when it comes to that.

2013
02:20:46,389 --> 02:20:49,390
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been their all-might, they've taken advantage of it.

2014
02:20:49,831 --> 02:20:55,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton's stiffened where they've had to many times, but Lincoln Sudbury sees something they like, and they're going to it.

2015
02:20:55,773 --> 02:20:59,455
[SPEAKER_00]: So second and nine again, same formation.

2016
02:21:00,335 --> 02:21:01,376
[SPEAKER_00]: In the pistol, Landry.

2017
02:21:02,347 --> 02:21:03,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the ball snapped, it's down!

2018
02:21:04,168 --> 02:21:05,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, he's down.

2019
02:21:05,409 --> 02:21:09,493
[SPEAKER_00]: He made the play anyway, but once his knee's down, another huge break for the Boxers.

2020
02:21:09,593 --> 02:21:10,694
[SPEAKER_00]: His knee's down, he's down.

2021
02:21:11,294 --> 02:21:17,079
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton will get Lincoln Sudbury down to about a third and 13 here, as we are at the six minute mark.

2022
02:21:17,119 --> 02:21:19,741
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be the biggest play of the game defensively.

2023
02:21:20,501 --> 02:21:28,648
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw the mistakes happen to Brockton in the first half, and now the tides are turning, and Lincoln Sudbury is making these mistakes.

2024
02:21:29,308 --> 02:21:32,470
[SPEAKER_00]: So the poor snap results in about a five yard loss.

2025
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:35,772
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a third and 15 for Lincoln Sudbury.

2026
02:21:36,153 --> 02:21:38,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Climbing under six minutes of a 17-14 game.

2027
02:21:39,275 --> 02:21:43,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Brock desperately wants to get off the field and give Semido and company the ball back.

2028
02:21:43,878 --> 02:21:48,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Lopes is telling the crowd, let's get loud here.

2029
02:21:48,461 --> 02:21:50,442
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle of the field has been wide open.

2030
02:21:51,123 --> 02:21:52,864
[SPEAKER_00]: The linebackers are up at the line of scrimmage.

2031
02:21:55,165 --> 02:21:55,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion.

2032
02:21:56,417 --> 02:21:58,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Back, back, back, the ball's thrown.

2033
02:21:58,098 --> 02:21:59,258
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a wide receiver screen.

2034
02:21:59,518 --> 02:22:01,159
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got room, he gets to the outside.

2035
02:22:01,399 --> 02:22:03,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tackled well by Brockton.

2036
02:22:04,261 --> 02:22:07,902
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking off the field, look at Sudbury, plays it safe.

2037
02:22:08,182 --> 02:22:09,423
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna trust their defense.

2038
02:22:10,223 --> 02:22:12,825
[SPEAKER_00]: As Brockton defense once again makes a stop.

2039
02:22:15,846 --> 02:22:18,327
[SPEAKER_00]: As back we'll see Jared Mighty and Casey Rhodes.

2040
02:22:18,487 --> 02:22:21,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they probably wanna, not wanna kick it to Mighty right there.

2041
02:22:21,909 --> 02:22:24,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's why Brockton's got two guys down there.

2042
02:22:25,312 --> 02:22:28,535
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of teams do not want to kick it to Jared Mighty this year.

2043
02:22:29,816 --> 02:22:31,157
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are under five minutes.

2044
02:22:31,177 --> 02:22:33,438
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the drive of the game coming up for the Boxers.

2045
02:22:33,919 --> 02:22:34,819
[SPEAKER_00]: A chance to go ahead.

2046
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:36,261
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had one already.

2047
02:22:36,921 --> 02:22:38,983
[SPEAKER_00]: All you can ask for after that first half.

2048
02:22:41,845 --> 02:22:44,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassell, he's been good in all might.

2049
02:22:44,047 --> 02:22:45,528
[SPEAKER_00]: The kick is a real good one.

2050
02:22:46,428 --> 02:22:47,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Mighty gets the ball.

2051
02:22:47,569 --> 02:22:48,250
[SPEAKER_00]: He receives it.

2052
02:22:48,570 --> 02:22:50,291
[SPEAKER_00]: He cuts back outside.

2053
02:22:51,573 --> 02:22:54,395
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another penalty you don't need to do.

2054
02:22:56,480 --> 02:23:02,705
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, he wasn't even near the play, so another silly penalty by Brockton will take away a good pump return.

2055
02:23:04,426 --> 02:23:07,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really inexcusable penalties.

2056
02:23:08,129 --> 02:23:14,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, penalty is gonna damper your field position, which is pretty decent.

2057
02:23:14,714 --> 02:23:16,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Moyes, the junior.

2058
02:23:17,096 --> 02:23:20,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So special teams, we've talked about it for years now, Orlando, special teams is this position.

2059
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:21,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's see the play again.

2060
02:23:23,041 --> 02:23:24,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what the referees are seeing.

2061
02:23:25,792 --> 02:23:28,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he doesn't, it's just, it's just a penalty, it's just.

2062
02:23:30,593 --> 02:23:32,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't hit the guy in the back.

2063
02:23:32,094 --> 02:23:33,214
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's right in front of the ref.

2064
02:23:33,974 --> 02:23:37,075
[SPEAKER_00]: So 15 yards lost, about a 20 yard penalty there.

2065
02:23:37,695 --> 02:23:43,037
[SPEAKER_00]: As Brockton with the penalty will, instead of having the ball near the 45, will have it at the 24.

2066
02:23:45,757 --> 02:23:48,578
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 433 where Brockton with a chance to take the lead.

2067
02:23:48,758 --> 02:23:49,759
[SPEAKER_01]: No one in the backfield yet.

2068
02:23:49,779 --> 02:23:51,019
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna go five wide.

2069
02:23:52,579 --> 02:23:57,220
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't seen this formation, they wanna talk it over.

2070
02:23:57,601 --> 02:23:58,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a smart time out.

2071
02:23:59,121 --> 02:24:02,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be surprised, they don't send extra pressure too.

2072
02:24:02,442 --> 02:24:04,783
[SPEAKER_00]: On the young single caller for Brockton.

2073
02:24:04,963 --> 02:24:07,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Semido with a chance for his first game winning drive.

2074
02:24:09,424 --> 02:24:12,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Any scores, Lelando on the out of style scoreboard before we get back.

2075
02:24:13,806 --> 02:24:14,506
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.

2076
02:24:18,427 --> 02:24:21,628
[SPEAKER_01]: This game got, it went from boring to,

2077
02:24:23,625 --> 02:24:24,746
[SPEAKER_01]: to a real good game, so.

2078
02:24:24,786 --> 02:24:27,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, Orlando, only one offensive touchdown again for Brockton.

2079
02:24:31,951 --> 02:24:38,455
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Boxers at 433 with their, this could be a signature drive this season for them.

2080
02:24:38,956 --> 02:24:40,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Coach Barrows has in store.

2081
02:24:40,757 --> 02:24:42,638
[SPEAKER_00]: He came out with a different formation right there.

2082
02:24:43,098 --> 02:24:46,161
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave Lincoln-Subbury a little bit of a different look.

2083
02:24:46,181 --> 02:24:47,401
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted a call timeout.

2084
02:24:47,562 --> 02:24:49,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And also this could be a season

2085
02:24:50,292 --> 02:24:51,653
[SPEAKER_01]: a change, right?

2086
02:24:51,673 --> 02:24:54,574
[SPEAKER_01]: A season-defining moment here, you know?

2087
02:24:55,594 --> 02:24:58,275
[SPEAKER_00]: You might- Big difference between one and two and oh and three.

2088
02:24:59,115 --> 02:25:00,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on the road at Lawrence next week.

2089
02:25:01,776 --> 02:25:02,417
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.

2090
02:25:02,457 --> 02:25:04,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they go- They don't change.

2091
02:25:04,057 --> 02:25:05,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turco's in the slot.

2092
02:25:05,418 --> 02:25:07,799
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure he's gonna come across- We're going five wide.

2093
02:25:09,119 --> 02:25:10,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Expect him to go in motion here.

2094
02:25:10,300 --> 02:25:10,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

2095
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:12,981
[SPEAKER_00]: There he goes.

2096
02:25:13,001 --> 02:25:13,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Good call, Orlando.

2097
02:25:14,241 --> 02:25:15,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco gets the ball.

2098
02:25:15,201 --> 02:25:16,102
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets to the outside.

2099
02:25:16,602 --> 02:25:19,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuts it back in and gain about four yards.

2100
02:25:20,385 --> 02:25:23,527
[SPEAKER_00]: So, positive yardage for the Boxers.

2101
02:25:24,408 --> 02:25:25,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how fast they move.

2102
02:25:29,132 --> 02:25:30,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it four down territory here?

2103
02:25:32,434 --> 02:25:36,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo looks over, talks to Coach Barrows.

2104
02:25:37,898 --> 02:25:39,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton gets to five wide again.

2105
02:25:39,839 --> 02:25:43,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turco and Jared Mighty look like they're gonna flop sides, no.

2106
02:25:43,542 --> 02:25:44,443
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay, they both.

2107
02:25:46,215 --> 02:25:49,317
[SPEAKER_00]: They both look like they're right around the edge of the tackles.

2108
02:25:49,857 --> 02:25:51,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Both looking in the slot area.

2109
02:25:51,638 --> 02:25:52,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo.

2110
02:25:57,762 --> 02:26:00,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Back, Turco in motion, he fakes, he fakes, he looks.

2111
02:26:01,504 --> 02:26:04,306
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open, he catches it, and it's a good catch and a first down.

2112
02:26:05,486 --> 02:26:06,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice pitching catch.

2113
02:26:07,748 --> 02:26:10,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, able to take the hit, hold on to the ball.

2114
02:26:10,850 --> 02:26:11,790
[SPEAKER_00]: First down Brockton.

2115
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:14,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice catch by number 19 for Brockton right there.

2116
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:18,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Shamir Williams, nice catch.

2117
02:26:20,344 --> 02:26:21,805
[SPEAKER_00]: He went up high to catch that one.

2118
02:26:22,966 --> 02:26:25,588
[SPEAKER_00]: The senior wide receiver, so Brockton gets a first down at the 35.

2119
02:26:25,628 --> 02:26:28,591
[SPEAKER_00]: The clock is moving, we're under four minutes.

2120
02:26:29,151 --> 02:26:31,153
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna have to stop picking some chunk yards here.

2121
02:26:31,553 --> 02:26:32,674
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's gonna go to Turco.

2122
02:26:32,734 --> 02:26:35,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke has room, cuts it up inside, gains about three.

2123
02:26:35,916 --> 02:26:37,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he should've been stopped though.

2124
02:26:38,118 --> 02:26:39,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Good game by Luke.

2125
02:26:39,159 --> 02:26:40,400
[SPEAKER_00]: So the clock is running.

2126
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:42,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln-Subbery has a guy down.

2127
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:44,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton wants to move fast.

2128
02:26:44,661 --> 02:26:47,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go, let's go.

2129
02:26:47,762 --> 02:26:48,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Samino gets the call.

2130
02:26:50,483 --> 02:26:58,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Gain of four by Turco.

2131
02:26:58,967 --> 02:27:00,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Still issues lining up correctly.

2132
02:27:02,089 --> 02:27:04,090
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's in motion, this one's gonna go to Jarrett.

2133
02:27:04,110 --> 02:27:05,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Jarrett cuts up, Jarrett has room.

2134
02:27:06,191 --> 02:27:08,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Jarrett cuts inside, back out, he'll get the first down.

2135
02:27:10,148 --> 02:27:11,810
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're at two minutes and 50 seconds.

2136
02:27:11,830 --> 02:27:13,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was all Jared right there.

2137
02:27:14,012 --> 02:27:17,896
[SPEAKER_01]: He was able to sniff out a couple yards and extend the drive for Brockton.

2138
02:27:18,316 --> 02:27:18,937
[SPEAKER_01]: First down.

2139
02:27:20,739 --> 02:27:21,980
[SPEAKER_00]: So the clock starts moving.

2140
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,042
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to start until the chains are set.

2141
02:27:27,586 --> 02:27:28,787
[SPEAKER_00]: So the clock does move.

2142
02:27:39,001 --> 02:27:40,783
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 223, the ball around the 45.

2143
02:27:42,225 --> 02:27:43,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton in the pistol.

2144
02:27:44,027 --> 02:27:46,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Samedo back, Samedo back, he throws the ball to Mighty.

2145
02:27:46,629 --> 02:27:48,131
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some room over there, he makes a cut.

2146
02:27:48,411 --> 02:27:51,235
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets outside, he's just held up by that jersey.

2147
02:27:51,515 --> 02:27:53,537
[SPEAKER_00]: He keeps moving, he gains nine.

2148
02:27:53,797 --> 02:27:55,699
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, they're gonna have to get some big plays.

2149
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:58,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that, you know what stopped Jared from going all the way?

2150
02:27:59,697 --> 02:28:02,800
[SPEAKER_01]: The player grabbing him by the shirt, literally ripping it off.

2151
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:06,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton just getting the ball to Jared Mighty and Luke Turco in space.

2152
02:28:07,224 --> 02:28:12,428
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at the Lincoln-Subbury 45 at 2-0-3 in the fourth quarter.

2153
02:28:13,269 --> 02:28:14,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Down 17-14.

2154
02:28:14,110 --> 02:28:17,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton also capable of kicking a field goal, Orlando.

2155
02:28:19,154 --> 02:28:20,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what they have here.

2156
02:28:20,295 --> 02:28:21,096
[SPEAKER_00]: It's second and one.

2157
02:28:21,136 --> 02:28:21,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they take a shot?

2158
02:28:23,230 --> 02:28:25,911
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it right here, Mighty made, he made a man miss.

2159
02:28:26,151 --> 02:28:27,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually grabbed him by the leg.

2160
02:28:27,992 --> 02:28:28,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shirt.

2161
02:28:28,412 --> 02:28:29,632
[SPEAKER_00]: The shirt first, then the leg.

2162
02:28:29,692 --> 02:28:29,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep.

2163
02:28:29,972 --> 02:28:31,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make a group attendance.

2164
02:28:31,173 --> 02:28:35,534
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the green house, make some noise.

2165
02:28:47,779 --> 02:28:47,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

2166
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:50,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Full time.

2167
02:29:01,768 --> 02:29:03,489
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go, out of the timeout.

2168
02:29:05,069 --> 02:29:07,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton is at second and one.

2169
02:29:07,170 --> 02:29:10,951
[SPEAKER_00]: They flop receivers.

2170
02:29:11,592 --> 02:29:12,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Guterko's in the backfield.

2171
02:29:12,992 --> 02:29:15,273
[SPEAKER_00]: 2-0-3 of this fourth quarter.

2172
02:29:15,393 --> 02:29:17,194
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who's getting the ball right now.

2173
02:29:17,214 --> 02:29:19,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Quarterback sneaks, so they want the first down.

2174
02:29:19,114 --> 02:29:20,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Sabino keeps the legs moving.

2175
02:29:21,055 --> 02:29:23,696
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna get down to the 38, but the clock is running.

2176
02:29:30,281 --> 02:29:31,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Brockton's gonna go right to the line.

2177
02:29:32,662 --> 02:29:33,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Lincoln subber, he's subbing.

2178
02:29:33,682 --> 02:29:35,203
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a perfect opportunity here.

2179
02:29:35,543 --> 02:29:37,243
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton moving a little bit quicker here.

2180
02:29:37,583 --> 02:29:38,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo in the pistol.

2181
02:29:39,944 --> 02:29:40,464
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap.

2182
02:29:45,646 --> 02:29:46,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco gaining yardage.

2183
02:29:47,286 --> 02:29:48,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco gaining yardage.

2184
02:29:48,387 --> 02:29:49,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a penalty.

2185
02:29:49,387 --> 02:29:50,747
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no?

2186
02:29:50,767 --> 02:29:51,588
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a penalty.

2187
02:29:52,068 --> 02:29:52,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

2188
02:29:54,874 --> 02:29:57,075
[SPEAKER_00]: So first down run by Luke Turco.

2189
02:29:57,475 --> 02:29:59,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like a horse caller, no call.

2190
02:29:59,296 --> 02:30:01,176
[SPEAKER_00]: He has the ball at the Lincoln Sudbury 25.

2191
02:30:01,977 --> 02:30:03,958
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 139 in the fourth quarter.

2192
02:30:04,518 --> 02:30:06,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Coach Barrows, creativity right here shown.

2193
02:30:08,039 --> 02:30:08,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see it right here.

2194
02:30:08,799 --> 02:30:09,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have the horse caller?

2195
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:10,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

2196
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:11,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it the back of the jersey?

2197
02:30:11,861 --> 02:30:12,801
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's the back of the jersey.

2198
02:30:13,041 --> 02:30:14,181
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a horse caller.

2199
02:30:14,221 --> 02:30:15,682
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought him down grabbing

2200
02:30:16,778 --> 02:30:20,960
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got the man in motion, they go to number one, he kicks the outside, there's a little bit of room.

2201
02:30:21,401 --> 02:30:22,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good step out, nice.

2202
02:30:23,182 --> 02:30:28,604
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went to Jaden Lopes-Ribeiro there, as we're gonna go around one minute, Brockton's gotta move quicker.

2203
02:30:31,346 --> 02:30:36,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Second down at about seven, they gotta start putting the ball up in the air down, as the ball, we're going under a minute.

2204
02:30:38,630 --> 02:30:40,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton taking its time, taking its time.

2205
02:30:42,590 --> 02:30:45,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Turco next to Samedo.

2206
02:30:45,591 --> 02:30:47,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Brocklin at the Lincoln Subbury, 21.

2207
02:30:49,951 --> 02:30:50,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, motion.

2208
02:30:50,832 --> 02:30:51,632
[SPEAKER_00]: They fake the motion.

2209
02:30:51,652 --> 02:30:52,272
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got time.

2210
02:30:52,532 --> 02:30:53,692
[SPEAKER_00]: He throws the ball over the middle.

2211
02:30:54,092 --> 02:30:55,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it hit him right in the chest.

2212
02:30:57,313 --> 02:30:58,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Another ball that's gotta be caught.

2213
02:30:59,073 --> 02:30:59,893
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect throw.

2214
02:30:59,913 --> 02:31:00,814
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great throw.

2215
02:31:01,334 --> 02:31:04,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe you try to, you can't catch balls with a helmet, right?

2216
02:31:04,954 --> 02:31:06,095
[SPEAKER_00]: You try to catch it with his body.

2217
02:31:06,475 --> 02:31:07,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Just catch the ball with your hands.

2218
02:31:07,515 --> 02:31:08,255
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect throw.

2219
02:31:10,012 --> 02:31:12,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't ask for a better throw from your sophomore quarterback.

2220
02:31:13,916 --> 02:31:17,819
[SPEAKER_00]: That ball would've gave him the ball inside the 10 at 45 seconds.

2221
02:31:17,839 --> 02:31:19,341
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're third and seven.

2222
02:31:19,701 --> 02:31:23,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton's got two plays to get a first down or they have to come in for a field goal.

2223
02:31:23,445 --> 02:31:24,846
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one right there.

2224
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:27,909
[SPEAKER_01]: It was there.

2225
02:31:28,129 --> 02:31:28,509
[SPEAKER_00]: It was there.

2226
02:31:30,451 --> 02:31:32,773
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Semedo in the pistol.

2227
02:31:32,813 --> 02:31:34,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turco's back there with him.

2228
02:31:36,047 --> 02:31:37,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the call, they're gonna give the ball to Luke.

2229
02:31:38,288 --> 02:31:40,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke moves, but no, that's just not it.

2230
02:31:41,109 --> 02:31:43,870
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a call timeout, so fourth down and four.

2231
02:31:44,811 --> 02:31:45,731
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes down to this.

2232
02:31:46,691 --> 02:31:50,513
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the play of the game, Brock in 36 seconds, fourth and five.

2233
02:31:51,573 --> 02:32:00,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'd like to see Samedo get out of the pocket and a little bootleg, try something with a little misdirection and get one of those receivers on one-on-one coverage with the ball.

2234
02:32:03,293 --> 02:32:05,354
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brockton gained about three right there.

2235
02:32:05,794 --> 02:32:07,374
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to use one of their timeouts.

2236
02:32:07,394 --> 02:32:09,955
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you think they're talking about in this huddle?

2237
02:32:10,395 --> 02:32:13,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's probably thinking about his best play right now.

2238
02:32:13,616 --> 02:32:20,198
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about redemption, decision making, you can make a decision right here that could potentially win you the game.

2239
02:32:20,998 --> 02:32:21,298
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?

2240
02:32:23,099 --> 02:32:27,420
[SPEAKER_00]: So, 38 seconds, fourth down and about,

2241
02:32:28,564 --> 02:32:29,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, maybe four.

2242
02:32:30,764 --> 02:32:33,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury, a stop here, wins the football game.

2243
02:32:34,345 --> 02:32:35,705
[SPEAKER_00]: A first down from Brockton.

2244
02:32:35,765 --> 02:32:40,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the third straight year it's come down to the wire between Brockton and Lincoln Sudbury.

2245
02:32:40,846 --> 02:32:41,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't ask for more.

2246
02:32:42,747 --> 02:32:46,627
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you play 48 minutes in football, man.

2247
02:32:46,667 --> 02:32:49,488
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't go by the first 24 minutes.

2248
02:32:49,988 --> 02:32:51,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And Brockton has shown why you don't do that.

2249
02:32:52,368 --> 02:32:54,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Coach Barrows has here right now.

2250
02:32:54,869 --> 02:32:56,049
[SPEAKER_00]: The coach is talking over.

2251
02:32:57,452 --> 02:32:58,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton goes to the line of scrimmage.

2252
02:32:59,053 --> 02:33:00,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what Turco's lined up here.

2253
02:33:00,734 --> 02:33:02,955
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna be in the backfield with Tomato.

2254
02:33:03,215 --> 02:33:05,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln Sudbury thinks they're gonna run the ball.

2255
02:33:05,336 --> 02:33:08,237
[SPEAKER_00]: They got four down tackles, three linebackers in at the box.

2256
02:33:08,678 --> 02:33:10,238
[SPEAKER_00]: They got man coverage everywhere else.

2257
02:33:10,278 --> 02:33:11,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is it right here in a timeout.

2258
02:33:11,919 --> 02:33:12,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, coach.

2259
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:15,201
[SPEAKER_01]: They just wanted to see how Brockton would line up, which is smart to do.

2260
02:33:16,777 --> 02:33:22,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that they've seen how Brockton was lined up, now Brockton, they're gonna keep the same thing or?

2261
02:33:22,721 --> 02:33:26,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin McKay, smart coach right there, looked at Brockton, what's he gonna do?

2262
02:33:26,664 --> 02:33:28,205
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna make some adjustments.

2263
02:33:28,545 --> 02:33:30,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if Coach Barrows comes out and makes an adjustment.

2264
02:33:30,926 --> 02:33:33,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got some scores here.

2265
02:33:33,448 --> 02:33:38,872
[SPEAKER_01]: With 9.45 left in the fourth quarter, Central has battled back, 20 unanswered points, leads Zavarian 20 to 13.

2266
02:33:38,952 --> 02:33:39,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Duxbury.

2267
02:33:41,073 --> 02:33:43,355
[SPEAKER_01]: up 19 to 14 on Franklin.

2268
02:33:43,995 --> 02:33:47,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Siema all over Lemonster, 42 to 14 at the half.

2269
02:33:48,018 --> 02:33:51,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Natick, final score there, 28 to seven over Milford.

2270
02:33:52,341 --> 02:33:55,643
[SPEAKER_00]: So back here at Rocky Maciano Stadium, play of the game.

2271
02:33:56,283 --> 02:34:00,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo Giannatasio along with Orlando Galvao, the Brockton legend.

2272
02:34:01,467 --> 02:34:05,349
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boxers and the Lincoln Sudbury Warriors coming down to the play of the game right here.

2273
02:34:05,369 --> 02:34:06,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton down 17-14.

2274
02:34:06,750 --> 02:34:08,491
[SPEAKER_00]: They battled back in this game.

2275
02:34:08,511 --> 02:34:09,352
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had a chance.

2276
02:34:10,617 --> 02:34:13,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Two plays ago to get a big first down, down to the five.

2277
02:34:14,198 --> 02:34:16,479
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball was not caught, so here it is right here.

2278
02:34:17,099 --> 02:34:18,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton in the shotgun.

2279
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:23,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Turco to the left, two receivers left, two receivers right.

2280
02:34:24,682 --> 02:34:25,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what they're gonna do.

2281
02:34:26,142 --> 02:34:27,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Semedo in the pistol.

2282
02:34:32,845 --> 02:34:35,046
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the snap, he is gonna throw, he is gonna throw.

2283
02:34:35,366 --> 02:34:36,766
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball's throbbed over, they got room.

2284
02:34:38,047 --> 02:34:38,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit him right in the hands.

2285
02:34:40,835 --> 02:34:46,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So, instead of trying to get a first down, it's a low percentage throw into the end zone.

2286
02:34:46,658 --> 02:34:47,799
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta go for the first down, man.

2287
02:34:47,859 --> 02:34:49,200
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta go for the first down.

2288
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:52,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple five yard pattern, you extend the game.

2289
02:34:53,322 --> 02:34:57,044
[SPEAKER_01]: But, unfortunately, chose to go to Lopes.

2290
02:34:57,104 --> 02:34:59,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Lopes, I hope he's okay, he's coming out limping.

2291
02:34:59,885 --> 02:35:04,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, Brockton's gonna lose another heartbreaker here in Brockton.

2292
02:35:05,259 --> 02:35:13,110
[SPEAKER_00]: So on fourth down, you know, Coach Barrett's gotta make his, he's gotta make it easy for a sophomore quarterback.

2293
02:35:13,270 --> 02:35:16,694
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a, that's a tough play for the wide receiver.

2294
02:35:16,734 --> 02:35:17,395
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough throw.

2295
02:35:17,435 --> 02:35:18,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like the throw was there.

2296
02:35:19,897 --> 02:35:26,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like Ribeiro may have injured his ankle, but either way Lincoln Sudbury did what they needed to do to win this football game.

2297
02:35:27,023 --> 02:35:31,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Brockton showed some life in the second half, but unfortunately it just wasn't enough.

2298
02:35:35,972 --> 02:35:42,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that play call at the end is gonna unfortunately stick out more than this final score.

2299
02:35:42,314 --> 02:35:44,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be a high percentage throw.

2300
02:35:44,094 --> 02:35:47,395
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't throw a corner route on fourth down and five.

2301
02:35:47,435 --> 02:35:50,616
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too hard of a throw to make, especially with your soft ball.

2302
02:35:50,636 --> 02:35:52,356
[SPEAKER_01]: You got plenty of time, 38 seconds left.

2303
02:35:53,256 --> 02:35:54,757
[SPEAKER_00]: First down, your four plays.

2304
02:35:55,297 --> 02:35:58,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you have some timeouts under your belt.

2305
02:35:59,178 --> 02:36:00,960
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you chose to go for it all.

2306
02:36:01,460 --> 02:36:06,024
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to wrap it up here as the final whistle goes here at Marciano Stadium.

2307
02:36:06,445 --> 02:36:08,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Orlando Brockton was down 17-0.

2308
02:36:08,286 --> 02:36:10,708
[SPEAKER_00]: They showed life here in the second half.

2309
02:36:11,665 --> 02:36:19,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff we wanted to see, they played more physical football, they were creative a little bit more on offense, but it doesn't matter if you don't win football games.

2310
02:36:19,527 --> 02:36:20,968
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Brockton.

2311
02:36:20,988 --> 02:36:29,790
[SPEAKER_01]: You are what your record says, and now the record says Brockton's 0-3, and this is gonna be an uphill battle, a climb here for Brockton the rest of the way.

2312
02:36:30,090 --> 02:36:32,394
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna wrap it up here at Marciano Stadium.

2313
02:36:32,454 --> 02:36:39,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo Gennatasio along with Orlando Galvao, Mike DePostman-Simmons, Curtis Reese, Scott Labussiere on the production.

2314
02:36:39,526 --> 02:36:41,790
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boxers are gonna lose this one 17-14.

2315
02:36:42,091 --> 02:36:43,112
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you again next week.

2316
02:36:43,192 --> 02:36:43,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
