1
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:03,634
Hello and welcome to this special meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:06,957
We're going to take a quick roll call and then we'll get started.

3
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:09,579
Jim Tirani?

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,821
Present.

5
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:14,162
Jamie Thompson?

6
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:16,304
Present.

7
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:18,346
Andre LaRue?

8
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:19,287
Present.

9
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:21,328
Yvette Velez?

10
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:22,669
Present.

11
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,031
Christy Aveda?

12
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:26,993
Present.

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,080
Mary Lee.

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,341
I don't know if we have Mary yet.

15
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:35,161
I think she's planning to join shortly.

16
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:37,182
No Mary yet.

17
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:39,722
And Mike Caldera present.

18
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:41,223
So we have a quorum.

19
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:43,983
And let's get started.

20
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,283
Dennis, can you please kick us off?

21
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:56,166
On March 29th, 2023, Governor Haley signed into law a supplemental budget bill, which among other things, extends to temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting on March 31st, 2025.

22
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:06,792
Typically, this further extension of public bodies, can you hold in meetings remotely without quorum of the public body physically present at the location and provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

23
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:14,099
The language is not making substantive changes to the open meeting law, other than extending the expiration date and temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st.

24
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:14,399
Thank you.

25
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,944
I can read the first item, please.

26
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:30,512
970 Felsway case 40b-2023-01 continue from April 11th.

27
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:46,447
The resumption of consideration of petition of DIV Felsway LLC of the Davis companies for a comprehensive permit pursuant to Massachusetts general laws chapter 40b for multifamily six-story apartment development located in approximately 3.4 acres of land at 970 Felsway property ID 7-02-10.

28
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:59,873
This proposal will be developed as an approximately 289 units to 2 or 3 units, multifamily housing, 11 townhomes with 25% of the total units of them being designated as affordable housing to low or moderate income households.

29
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:02,395
Thank you, Dennis.

30
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:08,037
All right, folks, for those unfamiliar with the 40B process, this is a multi-session hearing.

31
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:12,578
So we've been having hearings on this matter since last November.

32
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:17,199
Today, the focus area, as I understand it, is going to be

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,684
responses to the traffic peer review as well as updates on the architectural plans.

34
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:29,425
I believe that's correct, but I'll double check.

35
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:32,407
I see we have Pat Noon for the applicant.

36
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:33,428
Welcome.

37
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:34,088
Please go ahead.

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,041
Hi, Mr. Chair, members of the board.

39
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,763
Thank you for hearing us this evening.

40
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,345
Just jumping right into it.

41
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:49,929
And as I jump into it, I'll just update.

42
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:57,114
So Eric Samuelson from Cube 3 is going to be doing the majority of the presenting this evening and will be sharing his screen.

43
00:02:57,154 --> 00:03:00,075
So as I talk, I'll ask him to pull the presentation up.

44
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,537
To specifically answer your question,

45
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:07,280
We are not presenting on traffic this evening.

46
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,922
And I'm sorry if there's any confusion on that.

47
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:19,085
To provide a general update, we had a very productive peer review session with Beta.

48
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:27,469
Last week, at the outset of that session, it was agreed that we would not be presenting this evening.

49
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:36,386
The team from Van Ness, Scott Thornton and his team are preparing formal responses.

50
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:51,752
And we are planning to package those responses with responses to comments that we received yesterday from the beta civil team for a presentation on traffic and civil at our next hearing.

51
00:03:53,773 --> 00:04:08,342
just the nature of the comments from Beta on traffic and the level and the depth of the discussion that we have had, we just felt warranted more time for us to come in and formally respond to those comments.

52
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:21,150
So this evening, the presentation is focused specifically around the architecture and the design and responding to the comments that we received from Cliff Bowmer from Davis Square Architects.

53
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:34,620
And so picking the presentation off with that in mind, we did have a peer review session with Cliff as well and members of the planning staff.

54
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:37,702
Last week, it was a very productive session.

55
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:46,509
And so the thought process this evening is to walk through those comments, address questions that have been previously raised,

56
00:04:47,389 --> 00:05:02,978
provide some clarity, provide some updates on where we have taken the design since the last architecturally focused presentation and some of the feedback that we've gotten and hopefully the outcome of this hearing being in a place from a design perspective where

57
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:19,031
We are proceeding with the design that we have presented and giving Cliff the information that he needs to provide his final letter and letter of recommendation to the board.

58
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:23,034
So that is the focus of our presentation this evening.

59
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:28,639
and let Eric jump in and share the screen.

60
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:36,266
I can pause, Mr. Chair, if you want to respond to anything that I've said just regarding the topic this evening before we do that.

61
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,750
Thanks for the update and clarification.

62
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,410
Sounds good.

63
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:44,715
Yeah, the update I received via email

64
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:47,869
It left a little to the imagination.

65
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,690
So it was just a misunderstanding on my part.

66
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:57,275
But it makes sense to me for us to do the civil and the traffic together at our next hearing.

67
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:59,576
So yeah, sounds like a plan.

68
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:00,016
Thank you.

69
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:02,317
Great.

70
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:06,680
All right.

71
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,581
Good evening, everyone.

72
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,442
You should be able to see my screen here.

73
00:06:11,143 --> 00:06:11,803
Yes, we can.

74
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:12,944
All right, perfect.

75
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,207
All right, we'll jump right in.

76
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:20,289
So we have our proposed agenda.

77
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:27,112
So we're really kind of providing an update to the architecture that we presented about a month ago now.

78
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:35,276
And some of this is in response to the peer review comments we received from Cliff, as well as the session that we had with him beginning of last week as well.

79
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:45,061
So we'll go over some of those comments and then jump into the plans, perspectives, elevations, and then a quick update on some of the site plan and amenities pieces.

80
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:53,792
So, not much to harp on here, just re-familiarizing everyone with the site, the project site here at the corner of Myrtle and Amarith.

81
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:59,354
All right, so we have our current site plan here.

82
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:08,335
This was the same site plan that was presented two weeks ago at the last hearing that we had that covered civil and landscaping.

83
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:15,477
So, on the left here are a list of requests that we received from Davis Square, Cliff Bomer.

84
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:24,398
A few weeks ago, following the session last month, so our aim is to provide an answer to as many of these as we can tonight.

85
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:29,141
So, working through this detailed landscape plans, these are actually provided in the.

86
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:33,723
Last session that we have, but we also have these updated and ready to resubmit.

87
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:38,045
We have detailed plans of bike rooms, internal courtyard plans.

88
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:43,300
The garage plan, including EV and electrical bike that we will be getting to.

89
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,642
Roof plan with mechanical equipment that we'll be getting to.

90
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:49,263
Some updates with the building elevations.

91
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:53,045
The material call-outs we're ready to speak to tonight.

92
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:55,066
The garage ventilation strategy.

93
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:58,208
Sustainability narrative we will not be getting to tonight.

94
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,149
Civil drawings.

95
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:03,471
This was actually touched on the hearing two weeks ago, so no update there.

96
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:04,411
That one's good to go.

97
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,653
And then opportunities for introducing public art to the project.

98
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,671
So we're going to try and hit as many of these as we can tonight.

99
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,993
Some of these were answered two weeks ago in more of the site planning presentation.

100
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,994
So we'll be touching on more of the building tonight.

101
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:27,398
So here we are, ground floor plan.

102
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,620
So again, this is rotated at an angle from the site plan.

103
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,441
You can see the north arrow in the lower left.

104
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:36,582
Let me get my laser pointer out as well.

105
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:43,680
So, the 1st thing I want to discuss with the garage plan is that we are planning an open air.

106
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:47,583
Garage strategy, so it will not be mechanically ventilated.

107
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:51,165
We are planning for the garage to be open on the South side.

108
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:57,370
Which is the left side of the screen and the East side, which is the bottom of the screen.

109
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:02,282
There will be some louvers along the west side, along Amarath.

110
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:08,267
The exact quantity we don't know right now, but you will not be able to see into the garage from Amarath Ave.

111
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:09,268
That is not our intent.

112
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:14,293
You'll need to work through the exact open garage calculation.

113
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:20,996
The total parking that we have is 324 residential spaces.

114
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:25,057
There's 235 within the podium first floor of this building.

115
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:29,898
We currently have 89 exterior spaces accounted for the residential portion of the project.

116
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,580
And we are planning for 65 EV spaces, which is 20%.

117
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,962
And that will be a mix of both internal spaces to the building and external spaces to the building.

118
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:46,196
We have our bike storage room in the upper right of this plan.

119
00:09:47,357 --> 00:10:01,290
I have a blow up here on the right side of the screen just to show that in a little bit more detail, but we are planning for 100 bike parking spaces, and this will access both from the garage and from the exterior for access from the residents.

120
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,155
We also have temporary bike parking on the exterior that is shown within the site plan as well.

121
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:16,389
No major changes to the typical building plan.

122
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:19,351
So this is the second floor plan, units wrapping around.

123
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:21,633
We have our courtyards located above the garage.

124
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,375
The amenity space is called out.

125
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:27,238
Moving up, this is what we consider our typical floor plan.

126
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:33,203
And then as we get to the sixth floor, we start touching on the updates to the roof plan.

127
00:10:33,563 --> 00:10:37,106
So we have updates to this plan as well as the upper roof plan above this.

128
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:44,341
So here you'll see a layout with a condenser layout, roof hatch for access.

129
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:52,184
We're also calling out for an ERV, which is an energy recovery ventilator, also heat recovery unit.

130
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,105
So this is very early on.

131
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:57,667
We do not have an MEP design on this project yet.

132
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,528
That usually comes as you start progressing towards

133
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:08,471
Further into the project, but basically what we're expecting is there will probably be one unit that is slightly larger.

134
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:12,672
That would probably be the ERV would probably be about 6 feet in height or so.

135
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:19,415
And that would basically allow for and it would take the air from the building.

136
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:29,302
either heat it or cool it and it could get you kind of a 50 to 70% energy savings than a typical unit just pulling outdoor air.

137
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,525
So it allows you to kind of recycle some of that heating and cooling.

138
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:39,602
The condensers that you see located around the roof, those are typically about three feet in height or so.

139
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,065
And we have these shown within our perspective.

140
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:49,190
They're modeled within our 3D model in between the parapet height and the views that you see.

141
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,875
You'll be able to see that you won't be able to see them from these views.

142
00:11:56,937 --> 00:12:02,222
And then moving up to the upper roof plan, we have another set of condenser runs on this upper roof.

143
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:05,785
We have another potential ERV location here.

144
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,407
Again, this is very preliminary.

145
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:09,008
We don't know if

146
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,782
You know, if we need two of them, we might only need one.

147
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:17,404
So we'll have to work that with MEP to kind of finalize what that design is.

148
00:12:18,344 --> 00:12:24,187
And then we'll, we're also calling out our elevator overrun, you know, our trash overrun and some of these pieces as well.

149
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:27,749
We're not expecting anything on the roof to be over six feet high.

150
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,993
So I'm going to jump into the updated design.

151
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:46,207
So some of the comments that we had heard and kind of talked through a month ago was that the Amarath Ave side was a little too flat.

152
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:50,448
We needed a little bit more articulation along that side.

153
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:59,932
And so we showed the scheme with Cliff last week and it was, I don't wanna put words in his mouth, but it was fairly well received by Cliff.

154
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,772
He felt like it was moving in a better direction.

155
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:03,893
I'll let him expand on that at the end of this.

156
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:32,612
So, what we tried to do here was pull some of the design language that we were working with on the north elevation and pull it around the building to the Amaranth side, kind of let some of these pieces, you know, this brown siding come down to the ground and start to, you know, ground this side of the building, but also break up the extents in the length of this building by providing these two kind of outbound pieces that come down the ground and break up, you know,

157
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:39,065
the elevation along Amarath, but also tie it back to the north elevation.

158
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:57,052
In addition to kind of reworking the pieces along Amarath, we started to add a little bit more detail and articulation on some of the other pieces along this design that we had been working with, including some more articulation within these volumes along the front that

159
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:09,995
you know, to help break them up a little bit rather than just being, you know, one solid piece, you know, adding a little bit more character and, you know, with an archway kind of across this, you know, canopy along the front of the building.

160
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:13,536
So really just starting to, you know, dive into this a bit more.

161
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:17,817
You'll see that there's kind of some trees along the front here that are ghosted.

162
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,558
We intentionally try to make those as transparent as possible because

163
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:25,701
If I turn them all on without transparency, you won't be able to see the building.

164
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,163
So we just wanted them there for reference.

165
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:32,206
So that's what you're seeing kind of ghosted through here.

166
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:39,052
So this is the view from across Myrtle Street on Amaranth Ave.

167
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:41,554
And we're just going to work through kind of a few different views.

168
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:46,638
We're providing more than one in this to give people an idea of what this looks like around the site.

169
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:52,863
So this is a view, and we have the key here in the bottom left.

170
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:56,804
So this is the view from entering the site from the Fellsway.

171
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,985
You can see the extra space storage building here on the left.

172
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:09,607
And looking back, you have the townhomes on the right side, and then you have the main entry right here for the new multifamily building.

173
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:16,329
And you can start to see kind of the angle that we're working with with this entryway kind of aiming right in towards our front door.

174
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:25,838
And then this is just a view taking, you know, a couple hundred feet forward, more internal to the site.

175
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:34,880
You can still see the edge of the townhomes on the right and starting to see the kind of edge of the building that faces against the self-storage building.

176
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:49,163
You can see some of the openness of the garage on this side that will be facing that building, but also some of the detail that we had started to add along that portion of the building as well, which you'll be able to see a little bit better in some of the elevations too.

177
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:03,626
And then jumping over to onto Myrtle Street, we have the townhomes here on the left, and then looking in towards where we currently have the main entry of the site and our front door of the building.

178
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:11,531
And starting to see kind of that corner of Myrtle and Amarath, and how we're hoping to kind of see this activated corner.

179
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,553
Not really work for the project, but as well as for the street.

180
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:29,342
And then just spinning around, this is in the back corner of the site, kind of the end of Amarath towards the connection to the potential rail trail looking back in towards the building.

181
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:35,703
And you're seeing some of the updates we had made to this Amarath Ave elevation.

182
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:44,244
You'd see some of the louvers that we discussed before that you wouldn't have the views directly into the garage from the side.

183
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,645
So we would make sure to shield that.

184
00:16:48,370 --> 00:17:08,523
just there's, you know, from the last iteration to this one, I think there's just a lot more character to the side of the building than we had previously had, but also introducing some of this kind of warmer tone siding, you know, throughout the building, even towards the back to just give it a little pop and a little connection around the entire building.

185
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:20,647
And then the last view here, kind of at the corner of Margill and Amarath from the other side, looking back towards the site, you have the townhomes here on the left.

186
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:22,968
You can see the self-storage in the back.

187
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:25,308
And then you're getting that side view of the building.

188
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:28,169
This is Amarath running, you know, across the screen here.

189
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:33,130
And you're seeing the corner of the amenity space here at the ground floor.

190
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,251
But just seeing how this building meets the neighborhood at a few different angles.

191
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:56,261
All right, and just working through the elevations, I think, as I've said previously, you never really see the building from, you know, these perspectives, but they are a helpful tool to kind of see how the design's coming together.

192
00:17:56,802 --> 00:18:13,555
So, along the north side, we have the, you know, two warm tones on the left and right of the elevation, kind of pulling that, you know, warm tone siding kind of throughout this, you know, masonry piece that we have here and having the amenity coming to the ground and kind of elevating, creating this entryway here at the front.

193
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:17,096
you can see some of the equipment we have shown here on the roof as well.

194
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:32,099
And then the west elevation along Amaranth, you know, pulling that, you know, that warm color, you know, down this facade with, you know, two protruding bays kind of coming to the ground on this side.

195
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:38,141
We have a siding that, you know, mimics what we, you know, what we have with the masonry on the front.

196
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,001
Well, you know,

197
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:47,755
a more residential like material, you know, not, it won't be the masonry, but you know, we wanted to have it as a setting, but kind of pull that same color.

198
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:53,257
So that feeling was kind of coming down this side of the building as well, to really tie these together.

199
00:18:55,495 --> 00:19:00,977
And then as we wrapped to the back of the building, we have the south elevation facing towards the rail trail.

200
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:10,680
So we have a kind of lighter gray piece coming down towards the ground, splitting, you know, the siding coming across, and we use some of those warm tones.

201
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,282
It's just a few areas to pop on and relate to the other sides of the building.

202
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:23,645
And we do something similar along the east elevation that we say faces the Fells Way, but there's also the self-storage building here as well.

203
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:31,322
And then we have the townhome elevations that we did not provide any current updates to.

204
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:43,133
And then we just had a couple of updates that we are talking through with the landscape.

205
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,996
Masoud, I didn't know if you wanted to touch on these pieces.

206
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:48,778
Sure, absolutely.

207
00:19:49,198 --> 00:20:02,709
The main thing as in response to some comments that we received last time we looked into some opportunities to integrate public art basically and I think if you, the rest of the side elements are pretty much the same.

208
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:05,070
If you go to the next slide.

209
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:15,075
These are two main spots that we think are great to embrace the opportunity.

210
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:33,409
The landscape buffer provides us a good outdoor space, public space to both introduce some sculptures or sculptural elements or interpretive signage, or in general, engage with the city to figure out how to use that space to the best.

211
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,180
way possible.

212
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:55,830
And once the existing building is broken to the two lots, I think the self-storage building, the west facade is a good opportunity to create murals that will both create a better outdoor space and also elevates

213
00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:01,517
outdoor space for residents and neighborhoods as well.

214
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:25,448
In the next slides, I also included some present images of some of the things that we could expect and look into in terms of scale, material, and aesthetic in similar situations within landscape buffers and within public spaces, both in terms of sculptures and murals.

215
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:30,884
Yeah, thank you.

216
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:33,306
And I believe that is all we have.

217
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:37,251
If there's anything I've missed, I'm obviously more than happy to expand on that.

218
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:40,014
Pat, I didn't know if you have any closing comments.

219
00:21:41,555 --> 00:22:10,503
Yeah, I can just jump in to wrap up quickly just to make sure, as we present across disciplines over the course of the hearings, make sure that points get translated meeting to meeting, even despite the fact that different members of the design team on my team present, just going back to an earlier part of the presentation, from an EV parking perspective, just driving this point home, we did meet with Cliff, we did study

220
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:18,209
The code element that Cliff referenced in our previous hearing confirmed the quantity.

221
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:29,458
So this is not a site plan review, as you noticed, and trying to keep civil and this civil as a separate presentation, and this presentation focused on architecture.

222
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:36,744
But in terms of the quantity of EV spaces, which was a topic that we discussed at length at our last hearing, did confirm the quantities that

223
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:40,826
We need to meet and are intending to do that.

224
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:44,848
So Eric referenced that it would be a combination of interior and exterior spaces.

225
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:51,391
So we'll be able to present proposed locations for that as we get through our updated site plan.

226
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:56,233
But I just wanted to drive that point home that we did hear that in the last hearing.

227
00:22:56,273 --> 00:23:03,216
And that was something that we were able to confirm and are now able to incorporate and commit to from an EV charging perspective.

228
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:26,356
Another just clarification point in terms of the roof, as Derek mentioned, getting through some of the MEP design on the roof, what is being reflected is something that Q3 feels would be a condition that they have seen implemented on other projects.

229
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:40,761
So, for a typical multifamily building and design that utilizes condensers or units and having them located on the roof, we felt like this was representative of something that could take place and wanted to share that and model that.

230
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:46,483
And this isn't necessarily saying this is how the roof will look, but in a condition where.

231
00:23:47,143 --> 00:24:01,746
the MEP design winds up utilizing this equipment, this is a likely outcome for how it could be configured, respecting distances to the edge of the roof and maintaining the

232
00:24:02,427 --> 00:24:21,192
Um, the privacy of that equipment on the roof, and I think, as Eric mentioned, when he was presenting this slide, as you get to some of the perspective views from the neighborhood, just reiterating that, as you are at that ground floor perspective, these pieces of equipment were included in the sketch of models and.

233
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:30,241
These pieces of equipment were not visible as you are standing on the street along Myrtle, along Amaranth, along the Fells Way.

234
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:40,292
When Eric presented the elevations reflecting the equipment on the roof, that's from a perspective that is not standing on the street or standing in the neighborhood.

235
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:42,827
I just wanted to clarify that.

236
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:46,769
Then the last piece was something that we've been exploring.

237
00:24:47,129 --> 00:25:09,723
Eric hinted at it in the elevations and just trying to pick up on some of the comments that we've received over the course of the presentations, over the course of the hearing, that trying to find ways to creatively incorporate some of the historical elements of the building, whether that be through some of the public art, the sculptures that were presented, but also,

238
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:16,308
On that front elevation of the building, you are noticing more of an arched opening over the front doors.

239
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:31,540
That's something that we've shown subtly here and would like to incorporate into the project as a reference to some of the unique arched masonry openings on the existing industrial building.

240
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:36,564
So you're seeing a subtle change there, but just wanted to highlight that as well.

241
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:46,567
Just those are my closing points for some of the notes that I was taking, wanting to make sure that everything that we wanted to hit home hit.

242
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:55,450
And we trying to answer any of the questions that I thought may arise, just relating some of the previous presentations to today.

243
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,790
So that's all I have.

244
00:25:58,842 --> 00:25:59,162
Great.

245
00:25:59,602 --> 00:26:00,583
Thank you for the update.

246
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:09,728
So before we go to the board for questions, I want to check in with Cliff Bomer, our peer reviewer from Davis Square Architects.

247
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:23,795
Cliff, could you just provide a brief update on the working sessions and the peer review process and any kind of high level thoughts on the design we're seeing here today?

248
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:26,295
I will.

249
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:27,836
And hi, everybody.

250
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:33,238
The working session was last Tuesday, I believe.

251
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:46,284
And I think this is a good slide to look at because it does, I think it accurately references my memo that I did send.

252
00:26:46,824 --> 00:26:49,145
And I think during the working session,

253
00:26:50,605 --> 00:27:02,212
I was satisfied that everything was looked at that I wanted to have looked at, understanding that these are very schematic plans.

254
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:10,436
They're evolving plans, but they are schematic from an architectural perspective.

255
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,758
They are truly schematic drawings, but they had

256
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:20,498
pushed forward on all of the issues that I had identified.

257
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:34,085
I'm seeing some of these images for the first time tonight, too, and some of them are specifically views that I did ask to see, so I'm happy to see them.

258
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:43,290
I don't want to, really, I'm not the person, the entity who decides

259
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:47,860
of what's really working best for the community here.

260
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,421
That's, of course, the board.

261
00:27:51,262 --> 00:27:53,703
But I do want to make a couple of comments.

262
00:27:54,283 --> 00:28:02,508
I think from day one, my focus has really been on the primary

263
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:15,170
views from the public realm, the interface of the building with the public realm, which in my mind are the framed views on that northwest corner.

264
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,453
They're framed by the townhouse buildings.

265
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:25,058
So for me, that's very important, that old northwest corner.

266
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:28,581
But also as importantly is that

267
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:36,626
new street that's created along that southern extension of Ameren.

268
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:39,448
It's not really a street right now.

269
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:48,633
It feels like an access alley on the east side and a residential entry on the west side.

270
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:57,038
Those have really been my primary issues, I think, for obvious reasons.

271
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:06,441
And on the site planning perspective, I think it really has moved in the right direction.

272
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:18,946
I do think the importance of having a front door and a well-articulated front door is really critical to the project.

273
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:23,928
And I support where it's been going on that.

274
00:29:24,624 --> 00:29:31,653
As far as the working session specifically, there were a couple of other things discussed at the working session.

275
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:44,648
One of them was, I think, the further clarification of any traffic flow that's associated with the front.

276
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:51,676
doors, so to speak, which is a little roundabout entry off of Myrtle Street.

277
00:29:52,196 --> 00:30:05,782
And there was maybe a little more discussion about that western wall of the existing building, which is a new facade that's being created, even though it's not part of the residential development.

278
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:13,926
We heard a little bit tonight and saw some images that I hadn't seen before about ideas for public art along that.

279
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:15,347
facade.

280
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:30,515
I think some of the other things we talked about during the working session was the balance of it being a big building.

281
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:33,577
There's no denying that it is a big building.

282
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:42,982
And to what degree do you want to break up the massing and how do you break up the massing either through

283
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,952
articulation of the volume itself or change of materials.

284
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:58,256
And there's certainly, I think we looked at maybe four different ideas of how to do that.

285
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:04,698
And the one that you saw tonight for me was moving in the right direction.

286
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:13,802
But I'm not sure there was consensus about color of the masonry, but I do think

287
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:36,203
overall that thinking about how you take a big building, really highlight the most important elements of that building that interface with the public realm, but still respond through smaller gestures to the neighbor.

288
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:44,147
Well, here you can see specifically across Amaranth really is the primary point of reference to existing context.

289
00:31:45,147 --> 00:32:10,140
We talked about other things that could potentially be different in the studies that they presented last Tuesday that would have to do with more variations in the cornice height of the building that might help tweak the volume to a degree where it creates a kind of smaller scale.

290
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,602
But at the same time, it is a big building.

291
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:34,006
I think having a coherent reading, we did look at some ideas of how to break it up that, in my opinion, really had a kind of cost as far as the building really reading as a coherent whole, which is, of course, what it actually is.

292
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:42,908
To me, it's in a good place as far as where to move forward from.

293
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,261
But again, that's just me.

294
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:49,402
That was a working session.

295
00:32:49,422 --> 00:32:58,766
And I think the images that are presented tonight are advancing some of the things we talked about during the working session.

296
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:02,708
And I'm anxious to hear what the board's response is.

297
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:06,290
And obviously, I'm here to answer any questions you might have.

298
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:32,054
I will say one last thing that I think there was another image that we saw tonight, and it wasn't this one, but I think really focused in on what I was calling one of the most important views, which is really focusing in on that entry piece that is framed through the townhouse buildings.

299
00:33:33,235 --> 00:33:34,756
And I think that has advanced.

300
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:36,437
We did talk about

301
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:58,119
of whether or not, because one of my issues in the letter, there you go, in the letter that I wrote was perhaps moving the more transparent first floor elevation further to the east on that north elevation would be good.

302
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:05,185
But actually, I think that the kind of figure that's created by that two-story entry piece

303
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:10,550
and the corner piece works well.

304
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:22,077
So I was comfortable with not advancing that study of increasing the transparency of the first floor, even though it is public space.

305
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:28,542
It's not public, but it's a common use space in the new building.

306
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:32,644
But I think that's all I would say.

307
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:33,765
We did talk about

308
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:37,606
Sustainability, we talked about EV parking.

309
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:44,049
We all know that Medford has adopted the opt-in code.

310
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:52,573
So I think we know where this building is headed from a sustainability perspective just because of that state building code.

311
00:34:53,193 --> 00:35:00,276
So I'm comfortable with where this building will have to land as it designed advances.

312
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:02,837
So I think that-

313
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:06,997
That's about it for the moment.

314
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:07,678
Thank you, Cliff.

315
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:09,799
All right.

316
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:14,641
So now I will open it up to questions and comments from the board.

317
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:22,664
Andre, please go ahead.

318
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:26,346
Thanks.

319
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:29,828
And I have a number of questions and comments.

320
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,008
We'll see if I remember them all at once.

321
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,907
First of all, I just want to say thank you.

322
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:38,967
I do think that this is a good step forward.

323
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:46,829
I do like the introduction of the lighter colored vertical elements on the facade.

324
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,091
I guess one quick question is, what is that material?

325
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:57,812
Is that like a brick facade or faux brick?

326
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:07,489
Yeah, so on the north elevation here, we're calling for this to be masonry in this kind of darker field here.

327
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:12,510
The warmer tone color, we're looking at as a siding.

328
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,711
We're not assuming it will be masonry.

329
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:20,692
We're assuming it will be some sort of siding with a residential feel to it, a little bit softer.

330
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:23,813
But I think we're still reviewing exactly what material that will be.

331
00:36:26,164 --> 00:36:27,605
But a warm tone siding.

332
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:28,806
Yeah.

333
00:36:28,826 --> 00:36:32,068
I appreciate the archway in the front.

334
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:52,422
One question is, on Cliff's list of things that you mentioned you'd be addressing, I didn't see anything about the interior courtyard and what the units looking onto those courtyards might,

335
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:53,682
might look like.

336
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:56,483
I don't know if you have any advance on that.

337
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:00,123
I don't have it in this presentation.

338
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:06,945
I thought we had touched on some of that in our prior presentation in examples of what that could be.

339
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:19,447
I know we had shown previously some examples of courtyards that we were expecting to kind of incorporate, you know, within this based on prior projects we've done not only in Medford but with Davis and elsewhere.

340
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,842
but I do not have those handy within this presentation.

341
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:46,444
Here, this leads into maybe my biggest point, which is I had mentioned, and I say this for every housing project that I review in Medford, is to try to maximize the amount of balconies and access to open space that the units have.

342
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:51,628
I appreciate I see some, but my calculation looks like

343
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:55,210
just from visual approximation, about 32 units.

344
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,512
So maybe 10% of the units have a balcony here.

345
00:37:58,273 --> 00:38:01,675
And I'm wondering, I'd love to see more have that.

346
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:14,525
And that's part of the reason why I wanted to see if you had any renderings of what the internal courtyard facades were going to look like, because I'd like to know whether there are balconies there as well.

347
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:25,003
If I could share my screen for a second, I recently saw a building that I thought did balconies in an interesting way.

348
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:32,949
And I remember, I think at the last meeting, someone said, you're trying to maintain a more industrial aesthetic.

349
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:36,531
And I thought, this building reminded me of that.

350
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:43,885
I can just just going to throw an image up real quick then we can go back to yours.

351
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:55,241
So, this was in DC obviously it's a different context but I did like the fact that really maximizes the balconies of all of the.

352
00:38:55,962 --> 00:39:07,426
You know, the units here in a facade, and it maintained sort of an interesting industrial look to it using kind of metal work and lattices and things like that.

353
00:39:07,906 --> 00:39:11,707
So, just briefly to interject.

354
00:39:11,987 --> 00:39:17,069
I'm not sure what everyone else's experience was, but you may have to.

355
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:21,553
click to change the view to see the image that Andre's sharing.

356
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:30,703
So I'm seeing it now, but at the top, there's a view options and you can pick whether to see Andre's or Eric's view.

357
00:39:30,723 --> 00:39:33,606
Just wanted to let folks know that.

358
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:37,750
Are you able to see it?

359
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:50,890
So one strategy might be just for Eric to temporarily stop sharing, and then I think that would avoid the issue.

360
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:55,333
I can see it now.

361
00:39:55,513 --> 00:39:58,435
Just throwing that out there.

362
00:39:58,695 --> 00:39:58,956
Okay.

363
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:03,619
Anybody else having trouble seeing it?

364
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:07,982
I'm good now.

365
00:40:08,162 --> 00:40:09,964
I just got there for a second though.

366
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:21,535
Anyways, this is, you know, it's not like a kind of an exact match, but I just wanted to give the sense when I saw this building, I thought it was, I liked the way that they maximize the balconies.

367
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:36,284
I liked the kind of the industrial kind of aesthetic that it uses and was wondering whether, you know, there are opportunities to, you know, to do,

368
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:42,642
more with the facade to introduce more balconies.

369
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:46,384
That's just one idea maybe about how to do that.

370
00:40:48,726 --> 00:40:52,409
Both internally as well as externally to the building.

371
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:55,251
I think that's a great point.

372
00:40:55,311 --> 00:41:00,074
I know Pat and I have been talking about this back and forth about balconies on this project.

373
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:03,056
I think we're still reviewing those opportunities.

374
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:08,100
Pat, I don't know if you have anything you wanted to expand on there.

375
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:11,364
Yeah, I can yeah, thank you.

376
00:41:11,404 --> 00:41:14,208
I think Andrea, your comment is helpful.

377
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,190
I think it is something that we've studied.

378
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,111
It is.

379
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:21,337
It is challenging for a project like this to accomplish something like that.

380
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:23,319
And I think we have presented.

381
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:31,144
We have presented the exteriors of the building with balconies that we think makes sense.

382
00:41:31,164 --> 00:41:36,069
I think going above that is something that would be challenging for us on the interior.

383
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:40,474
There's another opportunity there for us to continue to study that as Eric mentioned.

384
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:55,592
The level of design that we're at as Cliff referenced is very schematic still and just getting to the deliverable that we are trying to provide here and finding that right balance of.

385
00:41:57,754 --> 00:42:06,024
Of getting to a level of design where we're answering all of our questions and providing intent without being able to study everything to its full completion.

386
00:42:06,946 --> 00:42:12,853
I think we will definitely be providing outdoor spaces, balcony access, but the.

387
00:42:13,874 --> 00:42:19,722
you know, the full access across a facade like that is not something that we believe we would be able to do.

388
00:42:19,762 --> 00:42:30,296
And frankly, I think it's something that just as we studied the market and some of the multifamily buildings in the area, not something that you see very often for this product type, you know, this would be a wood frame

389
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:43,069
podium construction type, as we've mentioned in the past, it's not that, you know, the precedent image that you provided would be very unusual for that type of construction to accomplish that level of detail.

390
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:52,819
So I think we definitely intend to find the right balance on the balconies, and what we are presenting is sort of hitting on the intent of what we're trying to meet.

391
00:42:54,622 --> 00:43:05,391
And if I can respond to that as well, Mr liver, thank you for the comment I I do think it's important to highlight that you know looking at open space holistically.

392
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:10,695
While we are not focused as much on.

393
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:20,063
Open spaces for individual units we've tried to really maximize the amount of public realm open space on a site that today is a 100% impervious and so.

394
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,274
If we had to choose and where are we prioritizing on the site?

395
00:43:26,894 --> 00:43:29,497
It was maximizing the green space.

396
00:43:29,597 --> 00:43:33,281
That's going to benefit both the project and its residents, but also the neighbors.

397
00:43:34,021 --> 00:43:43,691
And I think another consideration that we had talked about internally, as we were looking at the question of balconies and Eric, I'll let you check me on this if I'm speaking out of turn, but I think.

398
00:43:44,362 --> 00:43:56,304
in the neighborhood context, there's a little bit more of a consideration to not having folks looking down on neighboring residences in the same way as in the more urban context.

399
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:01,965
Yeah, I think that's a fair comment.

400
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:08,426
One thing I just wanted to note real quick was I seem to have lost my screen sharing capabilities.

401
00:44:09,466 --> 00:44:12,287
I don't know who can hand that back to me.

402
00:44:13,624 --> 00:44:16,408
Um, okay, I think you all set.

403
00:44:16,428 --> 00:44:17,089
Thank you.

404
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:30,706
So, you know, I, I understand I would be, uh, uh, you know, would frame over podium is different, very different construction than what I showed.

405
00:44:31,106 --> 00:44:31,186
Um,

406
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:45,728
But I still think that to the extent that we can try to maximize access to airflow and fresh air would be helpful.

407
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:50,192
Obviously, something we've learned a lot about over the last few years with the pandemic.

408
00:44:51,073 --> 00:44:53,255
I see Dennis has raised his hand, so we could just.

409
00:44:56,838 --> 00:44:57,879
Go ahead, Dennis.

410
00:44:57,899 --> 00:44:58,239
No, sorry.

411
00:44:58,259 --> 00:44:58,859
That was an accident.

412
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:00,641
I was just trying to hit another button.

413
00:45:02,862 --> 00:45:04,463
Sorry, was anybody else responding to that?

414
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,531
I can just add on to that too.

415
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:21,895
I think these are the types of details that we certainly don't disagree with you.

416
00:45:21,935 --> 00:45:27,479
And I think these are some of the design questions that are addressed later in the process.

417
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:31,362
And I think we're getting to the point where

418
00:45:32,336 --> 00:45:42,902
We need to start thinking about how to frame conditions and things like that, where the board is comfortable moving forward based on the designs that we're showing you today.

419
00:45:44,303 --> 00:45:52,268
But knowing that there are conditions built in and that we're going to continue to work with the board as the design moves further along in the process.

420
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,707
I have a couple of questions and comments.

421
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:07,727
Can you hear me well?

422
00:46:10,048 --> 00:46:16,151
So thank you, Andre, for bringing up balconies and whatnot.

423
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:20,874
And just to add to that, and I apologize if I had missed it.

424
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:23,555
My connection was not as great.

425
00:46:24,736 --> 00:46:26,777
The windows themselves are, you know,

426
00:46:27,797 --> 00:46:42,136
You know, we keep talking about hearing that it's an industrial design and, you know, so are they oversized are they, you know, is their ability to have them to be oversized and maybe a compromise to the comment of like, you know, access to this.

427
00:46:42,937 --> 00:46:52,062
You know, fresh light and things of that nature that Andre talks about and or the, I think they're called like Juliet balconies and things of that nature.

428
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:59,905
So there's that question and comment and then in regards to the public open space.

429
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:07,291
You know, the trash barrels for the public in these more community spaces.

430
00:47:07,331 --> 00:47:08,511
Like, what does that look like?

431
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:10,651
What does that feel like for folks?

432
00:47:10,691 --> 00:47:20,113
You know, especially even the townhouses themselves of their own trash and how it gets moved and where it is sitting.

433
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:28,174
You know, is it on the side of the community or is it on the side of, you know, like what does that look like and show?

434
00:47:29,895 --> 00:47:31,735
Bike parking for like the general

435
00:47:32,772 --> 00:47:45,038
community because I feel like this is such a development that is touching the community in such a way that like those public spaces could very well be public spaces in that way.

436
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,461
And so, you know, if someone's come in with their bike and their kid to hang out in that

437
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:54,326
That, um, you know, is there a space for that bike and that.

438
00:47:55,147 --> 00:48:01,055
Uh, those, the kids bikes, um, and then, um, just comment that I was glad to see the public art.

439
00:48:02,156 --> 00:48:07,203
Spaces and utilizing all the, all the spaces, including the building across the way.

440
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:23,339
But, you know, and but hopefully considering that, thinking about and making sure that the process for that to happen is, you know, is a wider process, a thoughtful process.

441
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:30,643
a bit more equitable in regards to asking who contributes and whatnot.

442
00:48:31,704 --> 00:48:36,786
Because I know you had made reference to possibilities of textures and things of that nature.

443
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:38,987
So I just wanted to put that out there as well.

444
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:42,589
So if you need me to repeat anything, let me know.

445
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,410
I think I got it.

446
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:46,171
I was taking some notes here as you were talking.

447
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:48,112
So I'm going to try and answer a couple of these.

448
00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:51,674
And Pat, I'll probably lean on you for a little bit of this.

449
00:48:53,402 --> 00:48:56,303
I'm going to jump to, let me work backwards here.

450
00:48:57,784 --> 00:49:02,866
So one of the things that I did want to touch on was the public bike parking.

451
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:16,272
So some of the things that we're showing in our site plan currently, so item number 10 here that we have labeled as a potential blue bike station on our site plan, which was located near the Felsway, near the bike stop here.

452
00:49:17,093 --> 00:49:20,054
So that's something that would be internal to our site that we are reviewing.

453
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:28,532
But there's also item number four, which is the bike racks, which we are showing a number of bike racks along the exterior of the building.

454
00:49:28,572 --> 00:49:31,453
Those are accessible spaces as well.

455
00:49:32,474 --> 00:49:38,736
So we do have those two locations called out currently within our site plan, proposed landscape plan.

456
00:49:41,877 --> 00:49:44,698
And then working back, trash.

457
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:57,212
So currently for the multifamily building, we have our trash room located here in the bottom left corner.

458
00:49:57,252 --> 00:50:00,833
This would be, again, the south side with the plant rotated here.

459
00:50:00,853 --> 00:50:03,174
So we have the self-storage building down here.

460
00:50:03,194 --> 00:50:17,779
So the way this typically works and how we're proposing currently is that there are trash routes internal to the building, which you can see kind of the trash room here located throughout each floor of the building.

461
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:23,751
So every floor has those trash rooms, those trash routes come down to the ground level here.

462
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:27,033
And there's usually either bins or a compactor here.

463
00:50:27,053 --> 00:50:32,115
There's kind of a variety of different devices that we could do to handle that trash load.

464
00:50:32,936 --> 00:50:36,438
Some of that will come depending on, you know, as we bring management on board.

465
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:40,928
but we'll have basically the trash internal to this room.

466
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:54,494
We will not have the trash external to that room on a typical day, but on trash pickup, we would essentially be able to wheel this right out, trash be able to pick this up, and we'd be able to wheel the bins right back inside.

467
00:50:55,074 --> 00:50:59,515
So our plan would not be to kind of have a lot of trash just hanging out outside the building.

468
00:51:00,196 --> 00:51:03,237
This room is really meant to hold that internally to the building.

469
00:51:05,705 --> 00:51:29,539
The townhomes, I don't think we had a full trash plan configured, Pat, but I don't know if it will be private to the site itself or if it will be public, but I think the trash load from the townhomes is a lot less than, well, it will be a lot less than the multifamily building itself, but I think we're probably still reviewing a little bit on that piece of it, unless, Pat, you tell me otherwise.

470
00:51:33,825 --> 00:51:40,387
Eric, I'll let you wrap up and then I can jump in and close it out.

471
00:51:40,427 --> 00:51:44,389
The last piece was just on window sizes and Juliet balconies.

472
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:48,310
Right now for window sizes, we're obviously showing a variety of window sizes.

473
00:51:49,431 --> 00:51:56,153
Some of the typical ones we're showing are anywhere from three feet by six feet to six feet by six feet.

474
00:51:56,973 --> 00:51:57,994
There's a variety of sizes.

475
00:51:58,474 --> 00:52:01,475
I don't want to say we're necessarily locked into that size.

476
00:52:02,615 --> 00:52:08,399
Some of this is going to come as we run through our passive house feasibility studies and the type of window we use.

477
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:13,922
There's a lot of factors in play that could affect the exact window size that we use.

478
00:52:13,942 --> 00:52:19,206
I think in general, we want to provide a lot of natural light to these units.

479
00:52:19,746 --> 00:52:23,708
It's better from a leasability perspective to have a lot of natural light in these units.

480
00:52:23,728 --> 00:52:29,152
We're certainly not trying to make them as small as possible, but there are a lot of factors that we'll be reviewing as we do it.

481
00:52:30,152 --> 00:52:41,620
But we're currently showing a variety of different sizes and trying to make sure that there's plenty of natural light within each of the living spaces, bedrooms, living rooms.

482
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:45,002
Every bedroom will have natural light within it.

483
00:52:45,122 --> 00:52:47,104
Every living room will have natural light within it.

484
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,767
So we'll be certainly doing our best to do as much of that as we can.

485
00:52:54,228 --> 00:52:58,231
And so I think, Pat, I'll let you handle Juliet's and the other trash piece.

486
00:52:59,687 --> 00:52:59,987
Uh, sure.

487
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:04,631
Yeah, Eric just raised the point that I was going to regarding the windows.

488
00:53:04,752 --> 00:53:13,619
There's a, there's a review and an energy modeling process that we will go through in determining the passive house feasibility for the building.

489
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:15,621
And that does help inform the window sizes.

490
00:53:15,701 --> 00:53:16,822
So, you know, I think.

491
00:53:17,963 --> 00:53:32,151
That's the type of information that we would be able to get to in our next level of design jumping into some of the other points and I guess I'll go and just go back in the order that the questions were asked on the trash pickup.

492
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,673
Eric Eric touched on the building function.

493
00:53:35,153 --> 00:53:43,498
You had, I think, maybe taking this to the next level and answering another piece of the question that you may have been asking just around the site.

494
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:52,335
Our final landscaping plan would include trash receptacles located throughout the site.

495
00:53:52,375 --> 00:54:02,459
So, located at the dog park, located along the winding path, located at the playground, and those would be managed by the building operations team.

496
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:08,981
Those bags would be collected and emptied and loaded into our trash room for the site trash pickup.

497
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,862
So, trash around the site and in the courtyards as well.

498
00:54:13,642 --> 00:54:19,825
commonly located trash along the common areas and exterior areas of the building.

499
00:54:20,705 --> 00:54:26,408
For the townhouses, Eric did say we haven't proposed a specific plan.

500
00:54:27,488 --> 00:54:40,914
I think we would certainly be open to hearing the town's thoughts just with the townhouse product being differentiated from the rest of the site and from the multifamily building and being more in line with the context along Myrtle Street.

501
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:50,881
Managing those units with a trash pickup that coincides with the rest of the neighborhood is something that we think would make sense.

502
00:54:51,342 --> 00:55:03,952
If that's not something that there's an appetite for, there would be the opportunity to coordinate it with the private trash removal for the rest of the building in the site.

503
00:55:04,072 --> 00:55:08,055
But I think specifically for the townhouses, there's an opportunity to

504
00:55:08,515 --> 00:55:22,018
to have trash pickup be on the trash pickup day with the rest of the neighborhood and the houses along Myrtle Street and have their receptacles maintained in their garage areas and brought out to the curb when trash pickup takes place.

505
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:26,859
So that's something that we can continue to find or have to find in our conditions.

506
00:55:26,919 --> 00:55:32,341
But I think we would certainly propose that if the city is open to managing it that way.

507
00:55:33,841 --> 00:55:36,942
And then just closing out on the public art,

508
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:46,785
Message received the intent of our precedent images was was to provide some.

509
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:52,787
Some thought and inspiration as far as process goes, you know, this is this is.

510
00:55:54,427 --> 00:56:09,286
An element of the of the site design and the project that members of the board and some of the neighbors have have brought up that we have responded that we're certainly open to but in terms of inspiring the specific design or coordinating.

511
00:56:10,227 --> 00:56:16,174
or directing the specific process, I think we'd be looking for the city to certainly weigh in and help us there.

512
00:56:16,274 --> 00:56:23,783
I don't think that we are coming out and specifically committing to a certain quantity of public art or sculptures.

513
00:56:23,843 --> 00:56:25,105
I think it's something that

514
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:32,350
given the city's desire to see it, that we would like to coordinate with you on and find the right locations and program for it.

515
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,171
So hopefully that answers your question.

516
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:43,736
And in doing so, finding an equitable process, an inclusive process, and the right program for what that does look like.

517
00:56:43,856 --> 00:56:45,897
We would expect the city to have a voice there.

518
00:56:47,698 --> 00:56:48,058
Thank you.

519
00:56:48,078 --> 00:56:51,860
I see Director Hunt has her hand raised.

520
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,562
Director Hunt, were you going to speak to some element of this as well?

521
00:56:56,484 --> 00:57:00,846
The city has a trash policy that I thought would just be helpful, just so you know.

522
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:05,747
Multifamily buildings are required to do their own trash and recycling.

523
00:57:05,787 --> 00:57:07,588
Recycling is required by the city.

524
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:18,351
It is my office's recommendation to include compost pickup, and I'm happy to talk to you about that offline, because as we're rolling it out to all

525
00:57:20,892 --> 00:57:27,475
under four unit buildings citywide, you'll start to get pressure from your residents because of that.

526
00:57:28,856 --> 00:57:35,158
The policy is buildings that are one to four units are on the city's trash pickup.

527
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:42,042
These townhouses are one of the more unusual type situations because they each have a front door down to the street.

528
00:57:42,902 --> 00:57:49,565
So I think that's honestly negotiable, but with myself and the DPW commissioner, we're in the process of rolling out

529
00:57:50,085 --> 00:58:00,350
A new trash contract where we're making this a more defined situation and working to move other some legacy multifamily buildings off the contract.

530
00:58:01,371 --> 00:58:10,575
So, you could just if you want to, like, just take that offline work with me and we'll we'll see what we can work out for the city send of the trash part.

531
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:13,440
Sounds good.

532
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:17,702
Thanks director, just 1 clarifying question just.

533
00:58:18,303 --> 00:58:23,905
So the board understands, so if the current policy were.

534
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:32,569
Literally applied here, the townhomes would not be eligible because it's 6.

535
00:58:35,915 --> 00:58:47,399
That's actually what we're trying to work out, because we have found that there are a number of townhomes that look like this, for example, in Amaranth Place, which are on the city's pickup.

536
00:58:47,879 --> 00:58:55,761
And if they were condo units and individual owners, it would just only make sense for them to be on the city's trash pickup, right?

537
00:58:55,901 --> 00:58:57,382
Like if they were individuals.

538
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:09,479
If those if those are rentals, then that's sort of a little bit of a different question, because then you still have a management company involved there as opposed to the individual.

539
00:59:11,654 --> 00:59:14,236
The street entry of that.

540
00:59:14,496 --> 00:59:22,142
So that's why I say it's it's something that there are an extraordinarily few number of properties that have this kind of layout.

541
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:27,466
And so we're trying to flush out which are they and just make sure that we're going to make sense on them.

542
00:59:28,367 --> 00:59:30,768
I apologize that that's a little wishy washy.

543
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,851
The city is full of gray.

544
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:35,252
We're trying to fix it.

545
00:59:36,562 --> 00:59:37,323
All right, thank you.

546
00:59:38,163 --> 00:59:39,984
I just want to check back in with Yvette.

547
00:59:40,305 --> 00:59:43,867
Yvette, did you have any follow-up questions or comments?

548
00:59:46,168 --> 00:59:58,377
I guess my only follow-up in regards to, again, I know we're trying to move on from trash, but for the townhouses themselves, and if you could show what they look like, that front, that front visual again, because like,

549
00:59:59,565 --> 01:00:06,987
You know, again, when I think of, like, is it a big barrel is a small barrels and, you know, what that would look like for the neighbors.

550
01:00:08,448 --> 01:00:15,130
And I know you may have mentioned this, but I also think you said garage, but that doesn't look like it would fit, but.

551
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:18,551
So, it's more of a comment and then I'm done.

552
01:00:23,235 --> 01:00:23,415
Sure.

553
01:00:23,855 --> 01:00:26,397
Yeah, I can speak briefly to that.

554
01:00:26,697 --> 01:00:33,081
The garage space would have enough space for both the car and trash barrels.

555
01:00:33,121 --> 01:00:37,523
I don't think we'd be putting in a dumpster-sized trash barrel for the townhomes.

556
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:45,708
I think the thought would be that they'd be your individual barrels that you'd have for a typical single-family home, and each of these units would have them.

557
01:00:47,608 --> 01:00:57,396
Just to follow up on that, these front doors to the units, do they have easy access to the garage?

558
01:00:57,856 --> 01:01:06,323
Yeah, there's direct access through these doors, both to stairs that go up, but also to the garage space behind it.

559
01:01:07,283 --> 01:01:07,964
Got it, OK.

560
01:01:09,765 --> 01:01:10,766
Great, thank you.

561
01:01:10,946 --> 01:01:13,368
Other questions or comments from the board?

562
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:22,530
think some head shakes, no.

563
01:01:25,471 --> 01:01:39,456
So I would just like to chime in and say, I'm really pleased at the progress made in improving this design and addressing some of the the peer review comments.

564
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:45,157
I do tend to agree with Cliff, this is this has moved substantially in the right direction.

565
01:01:45,217 --> 01:01:45,858
So my main

566
01:01:51,884 --> 01:02:00,547
Actually, I have two clarifying questions and I think a general comment related to one of them.

567
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:05,508
I'll start with the potential roof decks.

568
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:15,059
I know it's just listed as potential, which I interpret it as there's a lot in flux.

569
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:15,860
We don't know yet.

570
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:24,069
They seemed a bit undersized just at a glance for something that would be kind of a shared amenity.

571
01:02:24,089 --> 01:02:27,032
Do you have a sense of what is the

572
01:02:30,488 --> 01:02:34,694
opportunity for a roof deck in terms of sizing?

573
01:02:34,714 --> 01:02:41,202
Are these as big as they're going to get, or is there a chance that these roof decks could be larger?

574
01:02:41,222 --> 01:02:44,507
Yeah, I can answer that.

575
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:44,727
So

576
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:51,702
As part of the building code, you're not allowed to have amenity space on the fifth floor of a wood frame building.

577
01:02:52,783 --> 01:02:58,685
So in order to keep these under a qualified amenity space, they have to be under 750 square feet, under 50 occupants.

578
01:02:58,705 --> 01:02:58,805
I see.

579
01:03:03,776 --> 01:03:07,439
So that's really what's limiting the size more than I think.

580
01:03:07,499 --> 01:03:10,041
And this even applies to indoor amenity space.

581
01:03:10,121 --> 01:03:18,707
So you couldn't have like an indoor amenity space for say a function room that then goes into the 750 square foot deck?

582
01:03:19,107 --> 01:03:19,467
Correct.

583
01:03:19,568 --> 01:03:21,449
Not on the fifth floor of a wood frame building.

584
01:03:21,529 --> 01:03:26,733
You could do the fourth floor, but unfortunately there's no, you don't have a roof on the fourth floor.

585
01:03:27,874 --> 01:03:28,174
Got it.

586
01:03:28,374 --> 01:03:28,614
Okay.

587
01:03:28,974 --> 01:03:29,195
Okay.

588
01:03:29,215 --> 01:03:30,475
Thank you.

589
01:03:30,656 --> 01:03:32,157
And then my other,

590
01:03:34,293 --> 01:03:35,574
Uh, clarifying question.

591
01:03:35,654 --> 01:03:41,255
I think when the potential public art location was displayed, I misunderstood the graphic.

592
01:03:41,315 --> 01:03:56,340
So I'm now my current interpretation is the proposal is the public art opportunity would be on the facade of the other building, the one that's not subject to the comprehensive permit.

593
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,861
So, um, okay.

594
01:04:01,102 --> 01:04:01,182
Um,

595
01:04:02,888 --> 01:04:07,852
So I agree that is a potential good opportunity for public art.

596
01:04:09,173 --> 01:04:26,987
I'm unclear on the degree to which the board could really opine on that and impose any conditions that would be consistent with that, just because it's not on the property.

597
01:04:27,107 --> 01:04:30,030
So yeah, I don't know.

598
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:31,511
I know we have Paul Haverty on.

599
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:41,511
Paul, do you have a recommendation as to how the board should engage with the potential public art on that facade of the other building?

600
01:04:43,191 --> 01:04:51,317
The chair, I think that the board's authority, I think you are correct in that it's limited because it is not part of the 40B development.

601
01:04:51,918 --> 01:05:09,011
That being said, if the applicant is willing to provide this board the ability to review and comment on whatever arts or they want to put on that property, you can certainly put that in your decision as a condition.

602
01:05:10,092 --> 01:05:14,696
with the understanding that it's allowed to be there because the applicant has agreed to it.

603
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:38,636
Okay, so if the board, and on the prior comprehensive permit, we got very deep into the language and I don't remember the exact wordsmithing, but it would be within the board's authority to impose a condition that said something to the effect of the proponent will

604
01:05:41,489 --> 01:05:54,692
work with the city to explore opportunities for public art on the facade of the adjacent building, or does that go beyond the authority of the board?

605
01:05:56,853 --> 01:06:00,354
It technically goes beyond the authority of the board.

606
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:09,136
However, if the applicant is okay with it, there's really nobody to challenge that condition and you can have it in your decision and ultimately it would be fine.

607
01:06:10,461 --> 01:06:23,712
Okay and Mister chair if I if I may I I think you know speaking on behalf of the applicant I think we would certainly consider and review that condition but I think that's precisely what we're proposing here.

608
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:27,643
Noted.

609
01:06:27,663 --> 01:06:28,584
Thank you.

610
01:06:28,624 --> 01:06:29,204
That's helpful.

611
01:06:30,045 --> 01:06:32,367
Those were my specific comments.

612
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:35,089
So really pleased with the progress.

613
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:41,554
And then it sounds like I have my answer on both of the two specific fronts.

614
01:06:41,894 --> 01:06:42,955
So all right.

615
01:06:43,295 --> 01:06:46,897
Other questions or comments from the board?

616
01:06:54,263 --> 01:06:54,643
All right.

617
01:06:57,369 --> 01:07:07,959
Mr. Chair, just two, these are in the realm of suggestions, I guess, as planning goes forward.

618
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:14,105
One is that, you know, along Amaranth Avenue and that walking path with the art,

619
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:26,127
It'd be nice to think of it as a unified design with the public amenity space that's in the front there.

620
01:07:28,195 --> 01:07:42,365
I don't want to say what that could look like, but if there were, for example, sculptural elements that small children could climb on, then that helps extend that amenity a little bit more.

621
01:07:42,646 --> 01:07:44,827
That's just one suggestion to consider.

622
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,309
Another one which I think is

623
01:07:48,730 --> 01:08:10,047
just best practice probably for your landscape architect, which I'm sure is a matter of course, but we'd want to make sure they're native plantings and maybe even consider trees with edible fruit on them of some kind.

624
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,523
And I think those are good comments.

625
01:08:17,623 --> 01:08:21,165
And I think we're certainly planning to have native plantings.

626
01:08:25,828 --> 01:08:26,268
But noted.

627
01:08:26,288 --> 01:08:31,811
Great.

628
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:33,012
Thank you.

629
01:08:33,912 --> 01:08:42,457
So at this point, chair awaits a motion to open public comment on the architecture and design.

630
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:47,230
Do I have a second?

631
01:08:47,811 --> 01:08:48,151
Second.

632
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:50,933
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

633
01:08:52,575 --> 01:08:53,075
Andre?

634
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:53,155
Aye.

635
01:08:54,696 --> 01:08:56,037
Yvette?

636
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:57,098
Aye.

637
01:08:58,139 --> 01:08:58,579
Jamie?

638
01:08:58,599 --> 01:08:59,680
Aye.

639
01:09:00,521 --> 01:09:00,841
Jim?

640
01:09:01,621 --> 01:09:01,802
Aye.

641
01:09:03,203 --> 01:09:03,943
Mike, aye.

642
01:09:04,644 --> 01:09:11,629
All right, public comment is now open on the architecture and design.

643
01:09:11,709 --> 01:09:15,172
If you're a member of the public and you'd like to speak on this matter,

644
01:09:16,526 --> 01:09:21,529
You can raise your hand on Zoom and turn on your camera and raise your hand.

645
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:29,794
You can type something in the chat or you can email Dennis McDougal at Medford dash ma dot gov.

646
01:09:34,197 --> 01:09:35,538
And I give it a few minutes.

647
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:42,562
All right, I see.

648
01:09:44,744 --> 01:09:49,786
and Allison D, please go ahead, state your name and address for the record.

649
01:09:49,806 --> 01:09:53,007
Hi, good evening, everybody.

650
01:09:53,687 --> 01:10:01,329
Allison D'Agostino, resident of 1022-1044 Felsway representing the D'Agostino Family Trust.

651
01:10:01,429 --> 01:10:06,891
So really didn't have a lot of comment, but now I feel like I'm just a reoccurring person.

652
01:10:06,931 --> 01:10:09,372
So might as well just give my two cents very quickly.

653
01:10:12,978 --> 01:10:27,669
I think design wise I mean, it is tough to, I appreciate the visualizations I think for me just, I'm not a builder, not someone from construction background so it is still a little bit hard to picture the elements of.

654
01:10:28,845 --> 01:10:30,827
the design and how it would fit.

655
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:38,035
I mean, you know, most homes around the area, we are two family homes with, you know, vinyl siding.

656
01:10:38,096 --> 01:10:49,028
So, but again, I understand the industrial piece and having to match the brick, I guess that would be my only public comment is just making sure the coloring would align well with

657
01:10:49,854 --> 01:10:53,977
the remaining structure of the storage unit.

658
01:10:54,178 --> 01:10:59,762
But really just more clarifying question, because it wasn't necessarily clear to me.

659
01:10:59,862 --> 01:11:07,309
So from a, I guess, outdoor space, I know the mention of the roof deck got me a little nervous.

660
01:11:07,369 --> 01:11:16,056
And quite frankly, I'm happy to hear that there's not going to be a full expanse roof deck available where that clearly would

661
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:27,983
present a noise issue, you know, quite frankly, but can you just clarify what exactly will be those common spaces on this plan and exactly where they would be situated?

662
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:35,947
Just again, just was a little unclear for me to see and it might not be the purpose of this one, this, but

663
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:46,406
Okay, just to clarify, are you specifically asking about the ones open to the public?

664
01:11:49,829 --> 01:11:55,615
Yeah, I mean, honestly, I, you know, I've had some conversations with Davis company.

665
01:11:55,755 --> 01:11:58,298
I mean, I would prefer everything to be internal.

666
01:11:58,658 --> 01:11:59,759
I don't really want.

667
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,081
there to be a lot of public access.

668
01:12:02,141 --> 01:12:06,505
I have no desire to go onto the site and use any of the facilities.

669
01:12:06,565 --> 01:12:11,550
If anything, I want their residents to stay there and we can use our space in our homes.

670
01:12:13,811 --> 01:12:20,597
But yes, I'm trying to clarify just where there might be public space, where that might access the neighborhood, just from a noise perspective.

671
01:12:21,678 --> 01:12:25,181
I think alluding to the trash perspective, just trying to get an idea.

672
01:12:26,362 --> 01:12:28,044
But this visualization is very helpful.

673
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,084
Would anyone like to speak to that for the applicant?

674
01:12:34,144 --> 01:12:36,046
I agree this outlines a lot of it.

675
01:12:43,715 --> 01:12:44,256
I can jump in.

676
01:12:48,984 --> 01:12:55,791
The enumerated plan here we've tried to differentiate different areas and uses of the site.

677
01:12:57,252 --> 01:13:01,496
So, mainly focus on what would be the left of the screen.

678
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:08,343
At the intersection between myrtle and amaranth and coming down amaranth would be areas that we would.

679
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:23,949
Um, that we see as as being, you know, open and accessible for the public, um, the winding bike path that connects down to the, to the, to what would be the rail trail, some of that outdoor fitness equipment, obviously being able to to, um.

680
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:39,006
Observe and appreciate the potential for the public art and the sculptures down there and then, yeah, turning that corner out and at the along the intersection and the playground area there.

681
01:13:39,026 --> 01:13:43,371
I think it's our idea that the dog park that's more internal to the site.

682
01:13:43,972 --> 01:13:52,856
likely facilitates the residence of the building and the pets and not something that the public would generally want to come all the way into the site to use.

683
01:13:52,936 --> 01:14:01,960
So I think really just sort of bifurcating how the in terms of public access being able to come down the side of the site along Amaranth Ave there.

684
01:14:03,881 --> 01:14:06,282
But hopefully I'm answering your question.

685
01:14:06,322 --> 01:14:06,902
So it's

686
01:14:08,883 --> 01:14:13,505
Along the left side of the site along that winding path, there's outdoor outdoor fitness equipment.

687
01:14:13,525 --> 01:14:14,365
There's a winding path.

688
01:14:14,385 --> 01:14:29,872
There's some bike access and bike racks and then transitioning into a playground and play area as you meet the intersection and then and then moving plan right to the dog park would be really the other public.

689
01:14:30,752 --> 01:14:40,387
facing open space for the building where there would be pets on the side and outside of the confines of the building.

690
01:14:41,048 --> 01:14:41,408
Gotcha.

691
01:14:41,548 --> 01:14:43,591
No, that definitely answered my question.

692
01:14:43,631 --> 01:14:45,654
I really appreciate that.

693
01:14:46,354 --> 01:14:51,598
You know, I mean, with all respect, again, I've engaged with the Davis Company, Pat, specifically.

694
01:14:51,618 --> 01:14:54,640
It's been very open to conversation.

695
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,841
So I very much want to just say that publicly as well.

696
01:14:56,881 --> 01:14:57,982
I really appreciate that.

697
01:14:58,022 --> 01:15:01,044
And, you know, again, there's nothing really I can do.

698
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:04,466
This building of this scale is obviously going to go here.

699
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:11,151
But yeah, from my public opinion, I think, and I can't speak for the residents, but I'd rather

700
01:15:12,303 --> 01:15:17,506
whatever access, I don't see the public here wanting, we don't want this building in this neighborhood.

701
01:15:18,286 --> 01:15:24,210
So if it's going to be here, I think isolating, I appreciate the dog park being isolated.

702
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:29,993
You know, I'm obviously very concerned about having that many pets in the neighborhood, much less people.

703
01:15:31,514 --> 01:15:33,775
But, you know, I do appreciate the design.

704
01:15:33,815 --> 01:15:35,496
I think it is an improvement.

705
01:15:35,556 --> 01:15:37,137
So thank you for the time.

706
01:15:38,647 --> 01:15:39,067
Thank you.

707
01:15:39,087 --> 01:15:43,850
I see we have a Christina Kach.

708
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,731
Who has their hand raised?

709
01:15:45,771 --> 01:15:49,033
Christina, please state your name and address for the record.

710
01:15:50,053 --> 01:15:54,176
Christina Kach, 130 Myrtle Street, Medford, directly across.

711
01:15:55,757 --> 01:15:56,997
I have two thoughts.

712
01:15:57,117 --> 01:16:02,921
One is a quick question, and then one is Allison, great minds, because I'm saying the same thing you did.

713
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:03,941
Will your units?

714
01:16:08,518 --> 01:16:11,681
be furnished with blinds and curtains.

715
01:16:12,741 --> 01:16:31,957
And I ask because based on the renderings presented earlier, being a resident of Myrtle Street on the second floor, I will be able to look directly into those townhomes and higher level units, like direct.

716
01:16:32,858 --> 01:16:37,302
So I want to get a confirmation from Davis that they will be supplying

717
01:16:38,119 --> 01:16:43,800
lines and curtains in those units and not relying on tenants to put them up themselves.

718
01:16:46,921 --> 01:16:55,702
And Christina, is this specific to the townhomes or everything on the... So the townhomes are going to be a direct line of sight into their houses.

719
01:16:56,603 --> 01:17:02,464
I do believe the floors that will be above the trees on the larger unit

720
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,962
your warehouse-y looking building, I will be able to see into those as well.

721
01:17:12,404 --> 01:17:14,005
Could someone please speak to that?

722
01:17:16,986 --> 01:17:19,627
Yeah, thank you for the question.

723
01:17:21,982 --> 01:17:25,706
Frankly, it's not a question that we had thought about yet.

724
01:17:26,687 --> 01:17:36,519
So it's helpful to have you ask it because I think we, we need to think about it, given your concerns, typically.

725
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:53,037
The way that we approach things like this would be that for rental products would we would provide some sort of blinds or window treatments and in for sale products, there would be, it would be the owner's responsibility to furnish.

726
01:17:54,818 --> 01:18:17,057
uh to furnish their own window treatments or blinds or curtains or what have you so um i will for the multi-family building it's definitely the plan for us to provide um blinds in those units and for the um for the townhouses as they are currently programmed as as rental units although we hadn't thought about it specifically just

727
01:18:18,118 --> 01:18:19,598
They're a different style of product.

728
01:18:22,099 --> 01:18:27,920
That would tentatively be the plan, but we haven't gotten to that level of design yet, I guess.

729
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,840
So I guess the question is certainly appreciated.

730
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:39,082
I hope that gives you a bit of an answer, just without being able to definitively say one way or the other at this point.

731
01:18:40,622 --> 01:18:40,882
OK.

732
01:18:42,623 --> 01:18:44,963
And then for my second comment,

733
01:18:45,863 --> 01:18:53,888
I said all the way back in the very beginning of this thing in November that the residents are not going to use your outdoor spaces.

734
01:18:54,609 --> 01:18:56,250
We told you not to put them in.

735
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:58,872
You went ahead and designed them into this property.

736
01:18:58,892 --> 01:19:02,794
And to what Allison said, we don't want this building here.

737
01:19:02,814 --> 01:19:05,136
We are not going to use those amenities.

738
01:19:05,296 --> 01:19:11,780
It's going to add a lot of noise to Amaranth and Myrtle Street having them, especially number two and number four there in the front.

739
01:19:14,357 --> 01:19:18,878
And I also will never feel welcomed on that property.

740
01:19:18,898 --> 01:19:22,839
I know those tenants are going to know that I am not one of them.

741
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:25,900
You see the comings and goings of who lives in your building.

742
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:30,061
I'm never going to feel comfortable going over there and using that because I don't belong.

743
01:19:31,782 --> 01:19:36,203
And Allison already said it perfectly of we're not going to use them.

744
01:19:37,623 --> 01:19:38,583
We didn't ask for them.

745
01:19:39,244 --> 01:19:52,590
You've pitched this on numerous occasions as adding something to the community when a playground and a bike rack and a little open pathway, five and six, that ain't it.

746
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:56,111
That is not enhancing the neighborhood with activities.

747
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:00,993
So I just wanted to tag onto what Allison said of we're not going to use them.

748
01:20:01,694 --> 01:20:04,315
So it's just going to be loud noise.

749
01:20:06,941 --> 01:20:07,981
So nobody has to answer that.

750
01:20:08,202 --> 01:20:15,144
I was just calling back to my comments from all the way in November that we've all said it before, and we all being the residents.

751
01:20:16,505 --> 01:20:16,825
Thank you.

752
01:20:17,845 --> 01:20:18,206
Thank you.

753
01:20:18,226 --> 01:20:27,069
I do not presently see other members of the public with their hand raised.

754
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:33,812
Are there other members of the public that would like to speak on the architecture and design?

755
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:48,743
Seeing none, chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of this session of the hearing.

756
01:20:50,284 --> 01:20:50,584
Moved.

757
01:20:51,044 --> 01:20:51,984
Second.

758
01:20:53,905 --> 01:20:54,265
All right.

759
01:20:54,565 --> 01:20:55,986
We're going to take a roll call.

760
01:20:56,186 --> 01:20:56,726
Andre?

761
01:20:56,746 --> 01:20:56,806
Aye.

762
01:20:59,107 --> 01:20:59,467
Zet?

763
01:21:00,248 --> 01:21:00,428
Aye.

764
01:21:02,089 --> 01:21:02,689
Jamie?

765
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:03,529
Aye.

766
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:05,830
Jim?

767
01:21:06,531 --> 01:21:06,651
Aye.

768
01:21:08,772 --> 01:21:09,092
Mike?

769
01:21:09,672 --> 01:21:09,792
Aye.

770
01:21:11,037 --> 01:21:14,800
All right, the public portion is now closed.

771
01:21:20,404 --> 01:21:25,889
Yeah, so I hear the residents on the open space.

772
01:21:26,589 --> 01:21:28,151
I think there does need to be

773
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:32,709
some sort of balance, right?

774
01:21:32,769 --> 01:21:37,911
There might be young kids living in this building, and it's just as disruptive if there's nowhere for them to go.

775
01:21:38,051 --> 01:21:47,335
So I do think that it's worth considering noise impact in terms of the placement, absolutely.

776
01:21:48,255 --> 01:21:55,438
But yeah, it's hard, as a member of the board, I'll just say, to extrapolate on what the neighborhood in its entirety wants.

777
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:58,379
Definitely hear the concerns on the noise.

778
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:04,415
know, playgrounds, at least for during the day, typically.

779
01:22:04,435 --> 01:22:08,899
Yeah, just wanted to get that out there.

780
01:22:12,402 --> 01:22:12,762
All right.

781
01:22:14,183 --> 01:22:18,327
Would so actually, I want to check in with Cliff again.

782
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:25,412
Cliff based on what you've seen today and what you've heard today.

783
01:22:26,714 --> 01:22:30,497
Do you feel like you or is there anything that you

784
01:22:31,644 --> 01:22:37,309
are missing that you would need to produce your final peer review letter?

785
01:22:40,791 --> 01:22:43,794
No, I think I'm good on that.

786
01:22:44,174 --> 01:22:50,479
I've listened carefully and picked up a couple of suggestions.

787
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:58,505
But no, I think I'm good with where we're at with this set of documents that we looked at tonight.

788
01:22:58,785 --> 01:22:59,886
OK, great.

789
01:23:01,418 --> 01:23:22,522
And so at the prior comprehensive permit where you were also a peer reviewer, I'll just say I found it helpful that in that letter you did, I don't think you wrote them in the legal form, which was fine, but you did mention areas where you felt it would be appropriate to have conditions.

790
01:23:22,602 --> 01:23:28,223
And so if you could just keep that in mind as you're writing the final letter, that would certainly help us as a board.

791
01:23:28,843 --> 01:23:29,983
Will do, thank you.

792
01:23:32,655 --> 01:23:33,856
Mr. Chair.

793
01:23:38,037 --> 01:23:45,301
Just a couple quick thoughts about like thinking ahead to possible conditions based on some of the things that have been discussed.

794
01:23:46,201 --> 01:23:50,423
One might be to consider, you know, just making sure there are like

795
01:23:51,723 --> 01:23:56,147
Doggy bags on site and that the management company is going to be providing those.

796
01:23:56,887 --> 01:24:14,443
Um, another thing might be, uh, you know, I know there's not like a design for the outdoor space right now, but if there's going to be sort of a, uh, you know, some kind of playground structures or other kinds of structure, then, uh, you know, maybe there's a, uh,

797
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:26,405
the management company sort of has control over opening and closing it, um, you know, at a certain time in the evening, um, just something to a couple of things to consider.

798
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:33,448
Thank you, Andre.

799
01:24:34,888 --> 01:24:39,010
Uh, other thoughts from the board?

800
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:51,988
Okay, so we've gotten to the end of our planned agenda.

801
01:24:52,488 --> 01:24:58,657
I'm just going to pare it back my understanding for our next meeting, which I believe is on May 9th.

802
01:25:02,901 --> 01:25:26,386
So the intention there is we will discuss the civil engineering peer review, the applicant's response to the civil engineering peer review, and the applicant's response to the traffic peer review letter that we already had.

803
01:25:27,006 --> 01:25:28,466
Am I correct in that understanding?

804
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:41,333
That's correct from a civil perspective, we have scheduled a peer review session with the beta team for Friday afternoon to discuss the comments.

805
01:25:42,273 --> 01:25:53,436
So, the plan will be to to formally submit responses in advance of the hearing on the 9th and allow the beta team to have time to to receive and digest those and.

806
01:25:55,536 --> 01:26:05,563
on the date of the hearing to present our responses and any additional dialogue or information that we would have from the peer review session that we do have.

807
01:26:06,503 --> 01:26:11,267
And then on the traffic, it is our intention to submit formal responses this week.

808
01:26:12,527 --> 01:26:29,478
To the letter that we received from data and ideally follow up with potentially another review session with them if warranted ahead of the hearing on the 9th, but to be able to present our formal responses to the comments that we received on traffic as well.

809
01:26:29,959 --> 01:26:33,221
So, both disciplines, we intend to present on at the next hearing.

810
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:34,900
Okay, great.

811
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:35,881
Sounds like a plan.

812
01:26:36,481 --> 01:26:47,325
And so then my ask to members of the board, especially now that we have the civil peer review letter, so we got that yesterday.

813
01:26:48,366 --> 01:26:55,949
Please come to the May 9 hearing with your thoughts on potential

814
01:26:57,648 --> 01:27:06,394
Conditions, they don't have to be written in the proper form, but things that you'd like to see that are not just standard conditions on every comprehensive permit.

815
01:27:07,295 --> 01:27:21,225
I would like us to bubble up as many of those as possible on May 9th, because May 16th is when we're going to be discussing those in greater detail.

816
01:27:22,451 --> 01:27:26,134
in the proper form, so we'll have a draft set of conditions to review.

817
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:42,224
This is also when we'll be going through the waiver list and just making sure that we understand and are good with all the waivers being requested here.

818
01:27:43,065 --> 01:27:47,368
And so my recollection is that the waiver list is up to date, but I know that

819
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:52,562
The architecture and civil have changed a bit.

820
01:27:52,642 --> 01:28:06,989
And so please just review the waiver list, make sure nothing has changed, because on the 16th, we'll be going through that list as though it's the list.

821
01:28:07,089 --> 01:28:09,830
So if we catch something great, we'll adjust.

822
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:14,833
But it should be the correct set of waivers at that point for us to do our work.

823
01:28:16,366 --> 01:28:39,805
Mr. Chair, if I may just jump in on that and you beat me to the punch, I was going to suggest that given that we are coming up toward the end of what we've circled as the schedule, it would make sense to take another look, especially now that I think we're all in a good place as far as the architectural design and site plan.

824
01:28:40,005 --> 01:28:42,187
The waiver list was last updated when we

825
01:28:42,827 --> 01:28:59,312
submitted our supplemental materials last November, so I think certainly it should be close, but there may be some additional updates and some updates may come out of the final peer review on civil and traffic as well.

826
01:29:00,433 --> 01:29:07,535
So we'll, I think, be going through that live and making sure and working with Attorney Haberty

827
01:29:08,714 --> 01:29:10,036
so that we're all on the same page.

828
01:29:10,116 --> 01:29:29,753
But I do think that in, you know, between now and the 9th, as long as this works for you and for the board, I think, you know, we'll talk offline with Attorney Haverty on starting to get the waiver list and any standard conditions that we can work through teed up as best we can just to be efficient with our time and with your time.

829
01:29:31,294 --> 01:29:31,515
Yes.

830
01:29:31,635 --> 01:29:32,275
Sounds good.

831
01:29:32,315 --> 01:29:32,836
Thank you.

832
01:29:32,916 --> 01:29:33,476
Please do that.

833
01:29:33,997 --> 01:29:35,218
That'll be much appreciated.

834
01:29:37,948 --> 01:29:42,690
All right, so it sounds like we're on the same page.

835
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:43,531
We have a plan.

836
01:29:44,691 --> 01:29:55,357
So chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to Thursday, May 9, 6.30 PM.

837
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:57,398
So moved.

838
01:29:57,438 --> 01:29:58,738
Do I have a second?

839
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:02,580
OK, we're going to take a roll call.

840
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:03,301
Andre?

841
01:30:03,321 --> 01:30:03,381
Aye.

842
01:30:08,693 --> 01:30:08,813
Aye.

843
01:30:10,054 --> 01:30:10,474
Jamie.

844
01:30:10,494 --> 01:30:11,715
Aye.

845
01:30:12,556 --> 01:30:12,936
Jim.

846
01:30:13,717 --> 01:30:13,917
Aye.

847
01:30:14,797 --> 01:30:15,498
Mike, aye.

848
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:16,239
All right.

849
01:30:16,699 --> 01:30:18,000
The matter is continued.

850
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:19,021
Thank you, folks.

851
01:30:19,061 --> 01:30:20,301
Have a great rest of your evening.

852
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:22,003
We'll see you in a couple of weeks.

853
01:30:23,003 --> 01:30:23,384
Thank you.

854
01:30:23,784 --> 01:30:24,164
Thank you.

855
01:30:25,285 --> 01:30:25,585
All right.

856
01:30:25,605 --> 01:30:26,506
Thank you very much.

857
01:30:27,226 --> 01:30:29,928
Dennis, what's next on the agenda?

858
01:30:29,948 --> 01:30:36,393
I thought you were on mute.

859
01:30:42,613 --> 01:30:43,974
Yeah, sorry, I'm using my phone.

860
01:30:44,014 --> 01:30:47,896
So the mute I feel like physically touch the phone to unmute myself.

861
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,257
I think I'm not sure.

862
01:30:49,698 --> 01:30:50,838
I might be able to do in a computer room.

863
01:30:50,858 --> 01:30:51,158
Not really.

864
01:30:51,178 --> 01:30:52,179
I'm centering and I'm rambling.

865
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:53,240
I'm sorry.

866
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:55,661
Next item on the agenda is administrative updates, which.

867
01:30:58,064 --> 01:31:16,111
The only thing which I can sort of tell you, I mean, we do have the start of the other 40Bs starting next Tuesday, and we've reached out, and Cliff is going to be back as design peer review, and we've got Tetra Tech back doing the civil review for that one.

868
01:31:17,011 --> 01:31:22,574
So we've got, we haven't technically gotten their offers yet, but, you know, they've agreed to it.

869
01:31:23,074 --> 01:31:25,675
So we're just waiting to hear that, and then we'll submit them to the applicant.

870
01:31:26,761 --> 01:31:29,502
you have to check so we can get them rolling on the peer review as soon as possible.

871
01:31:30,542 --> 01:31:55,348
Right and so yeah so the on that Tuesday meeting we will um the the board intends to weigh in on any topics requiring board authorization for the city to to do those things and correct yes beautiful okay and the applicant says they're just going to make a brief presentation at the sort of the beginning just to overline their intention for the project but no you know

872
01:31:56,012 --> 01:32:00,055
full details from, you know, engineering or architects or anything like that.

873
01:32:00,295 --> 01:32:09,902
It'll just be like a quick little, what my intention, their intention was just a brief overview of the project and show some slides and sort of discuss the general project.

874
01:32:10,963 --> 01:32:11,223
Okay.

875
01:32:12,744 --> 01:32:12,924
Great.

876
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:13,184
Great.

877
01:32:15,025 --> 01:32:18,788
Um, and then we have new minutes.

878
01:32:18,868 --> 01:32:22,951
I, I didn't get a chance to you.

879
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:32,213
I did send them out for the 26th and the 11th, but if people haven't chance to review, we can hold off on those.

880
01:32:33,093 --> 01:32:35,054
Well, I'll check in with the board.

881
01:32:37,335 --> 01:32:39,355
Has anyone had a chance to review?

882
01:32:39,375 --> 01:32:41,836
Amy, yes.

883
01:32:44,497 --> 01:32:44,897
I haven't.

884
01:32:44,937 --> 01:32:46,958
If we could put it off to next time, that'd be great.

885
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:49,050
OK.

886
01:32:49,851 --> 01:32:50,371
Sounds good.

887
01:32:50,451 --> 01:32:51,732
So we'll review those.

888
01:32:52,293 --> 01:32:54,014
And tonight as well.

889
01:32:54,034 --> 01:32:55,495
So one of that one.

890
01:32:55,515 --> 01:32:57,297
So before the May 9th one.

891
01:32:57,337 --> 01:32:57,817
Sounds good.

892
01:32:58,057 --> 01:32:58,358
OK.

893
01:32:59,358 --> 01:32:59,659
All right.
