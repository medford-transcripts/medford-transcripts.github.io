1
00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:00,551
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:04,593
Hi, I am here with Christina Pascucci Ciampa.

3
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:05,813
I hope I said that right.

4
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:07,494
Oh, you sure did.

5
00:00:07,534 --> 00:00:08,295
Yes, thank you.

6
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:16,138
Yeah, and she is with All She Wrote Books and is going to tell us a little bit about how she started the bookstore.

7
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:18,023
Thanks so much.

8
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:21,164
So my name is Christina Pascucci Ciampa.

9
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:26,806
I'm the owner of All She Wrote Books here located at Assembly Row in Somerville.

10
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:44,593
All She Wrote Books is an intersectional queer feminist bookstore that focuses on really celebrating and uplifting marginalized voices, voices that have been typically historically suppressed and also really

11
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:50,203
finding ways to bring books that people can find themselves in.

12
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:55,044
So we really strive to harness that as our mission.

13
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:58,425
And we started as a pop-up bookstore.

14
00:00:58,465 --> 00:01:03,106
So it was an idea that came to me at the beginning of 2019.

15
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:11,807
And we had our first pop-up with like 25 books at Bow Market, which is located in Union Square.

16
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:15,028
And I didn't think I would sell a book at all.

17
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:17,270
And we sold five that day.

18
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,793
And I was like, oh, okay, this is a thing.

19
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:26,562
And we just kept going and we kept partnering with other local businesses in the area, including Winter Hill Brewery.

20
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:35,726
Juliet, which is an amazing restaurant in Union Square, and many others, JP Knit and Stitch, a few others.

21
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,447
And then we also did markets.

22
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:43,511
So you would find us at different local markets popping up throughout the greater Boston area.

23
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:44,692
So that's how we got started.

24
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:56,980
And we always knew we wanted to have a brick and mortar because ultimately we wanted to not only create a space where all of these amazing books could be curated, but also to create a safe space.

25
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:10,136
for those to feel like, you know, who have either been shuttered out of their family lives or just in general by society, that they can always have a place to come and feel loved and respected as a person.

26
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:18,441
And that to me is really important, but also then goes back to the other part that I was mentioning before about finding themselves within the books that we carry.

27
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:20,803
So to me, that's really, you know,

28
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:22,048
important.

29
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:36,672
And so in 2020, very interesting year, we went down the path of opening a brick and mortar, obviously, in the beginning of it, because we had no idea there would be a pandemic on our hands.

30
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,572
But we still moved forward.

31
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:46,014
And we opened to the public on July 10 of this year, with obviously COVID protocols in place.

32
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:48,595
And we've been open ever since.

33
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:49,575
And we

34
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:55,071
You know, I love what I do every day, and it's been an amazing journey thus far.

35
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:56,172
Wow.

36
00:02:56,632 --> 00:03:00,596
Honestly, it's such a beautiful, it's really a beautiful, beautiful mission.

37
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,537
I'm so moved.

38
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:06,541
So it sounds like you opened during COVID.

39
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,482
Yeah, ultimately.

40
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:17,350
I imagine that you expected to open during normal times, like when you first signed the lease and those sorts of things you didn't realize.

41
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:24,319
Yeah, so we had this conversation in January of 2020 with Assembly Row.

42
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:26,041
It started in January.

43
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:36,970
It was a hybrid concept of bringing the bookstore here and seeing how it would do and all the things and being infused in the community.

44
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:41,493
And yeah, without any inclination of COVID,

45
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:47,536
you know, went ahead, got our LLC, became like very official and all the things.

46
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:51,999
And so we signed our lease at the end of February.

47
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,500
I got keys in March.

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:04,705
And then two days later, Governor Baker got on the television and was like, I'm so sorry, but non-essential retail is now officially closed.

49
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:05,125
And I was like,

50
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,043
We're not doing anything now.

51
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:14,109
So it just meant that we were, you know, we were an online business at the moment.

52
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:19,054
And so we did that from March till about April, May.

53
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:29,804
And then we had the opportunity to partner with East Somerville Main Streets, which is a local nonprofit here that works with the small businesses in the area to ensure that they have the resources they need

54
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:32,845
to conduct business, to be successful.

55
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,546
It's a great organization.

56
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:40,949
I'm proud to be a part of it as a business owner and as a resident of East Somerville as well.

57
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:47,732
So they had the opportunity to do an outdoor market starting in May.

58
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:55,295
So this gave us an opportunity, excuse me, an opportunity to try contactless pickup for the first time.

59
00:04:56,466 --> 00:05:06,652
And honestly, it was the best primer that we had, because then we took those same concepts and learnings that we had from that into the store, which is now what we do for curbside here today.

60
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:18,158
And then once the state was like, oh, you can do retail curbside, I think it was at the end of May, we were like, okay, this is our window to come in and do the work.

61
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,160
And so the work really was to get the space in the place that we wanted it to be.

62
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:36,850
That meant making this beautiful rainbow wall that's behind me with the beautiful clouds, but also just like configuring the space, making sure that it was ADA compliant, making sure that anybody could walk in without any issues and also felt safe.

63
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:42,576
So it was really an opportunity for us to test trial, you know, what, you know,

64
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,298
how would we do walk-ins?

65
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:46,598
Would we start with appointments?

66
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,680
And we initially started with just appointments only.

67
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,781
And then towards the middle of the summer, we decided to do a hybrid.

68
00:05:53,881 --> 00:06:02,625
So during slower days, we allow for walk-ins, but on a very small number basis.

69
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:09,028
And continued to do that, but obviously pushed for online in-store appointments, which

70
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:31,716
allow people to have private, ultimately, private shopping appointments within our store for more than 30, for 30 minutes, which was the kind of recommended timing that I saw other bookstores doing and felt like that was kind of like a nice time frame to be inside a place and not to necessarily, you know, fear

71
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,621
the fear of being in there.

72
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:38,523
And so really just kind of like, and constantly pivoting.

73
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,645
And then we also had our online store as well.

74
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:45,767
And that has been very active both in March, even now, obviously.

75
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:59,375
And we continue to balance both the in-store aspect of it, but also ensure that our customers are getting the same experience or somewhat of the same experience that they would if they were in-store.

76
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:04,219
I write handwritten notes with every single order that I get.

77
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:13,027
It's my way of connecting, just as much as it would be if a person walked in the door right now for an in-store browsing appointment.

78
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:13,888
It's that connection.

79
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:18,672
It's that human connection, but obviously in a safe and smart manner.

80
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,224
And I think that is really important.

81
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:47,904
And that's how we've been able to, to do what we do and continue to, to be in existence in 2020, which is, you know, obviously we've seen, unfortunately, a lot of small businesses not make it this year and it's, it's extremely sad and unfortunate, but, um, you know, I'm thankful for every opportunity and this journey thus far, and we'll see where it takes us as we move forward in with the rest of 2020, but also moving into 2021.

82
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:55,445
Well, speaking of the rest of 2020, we are in the holiday season and people love books.

83
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:56,526
Yes.

84
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:59,007
And how can, how could people shop with you?

85
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:01,908
Yeah, there's several ways that you can shop with us.

86
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:10,152
So everything that we have in inventory in store is available on our website, allshewrotebooks.com backslash bookstore.

87
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:15,114
We pretty much at this moment, December 15th,

88
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:25,974
If you are going to ship across the United States, we recommend that you get your orders in for USPS priority between today and tomorrow.

89
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:28,096
Otherwise, it will not make it for Christmas.

90
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:36,161
We can't guarantee any kind of shipping times at this point, but that's just a gentle reminder that if you do need to ship stuff,

91
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:41,865
And it will ultimately be at an expedited shipping cost.

92
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:43,346
So just keep that in mind.

93
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:45,408
Now, let's say, you know what?

94
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:51,993
Your gifts are being dropped off around the corner from your neighbor or a family member or whatever it is.

95
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:53,815
We offer curbside pickup as well.

96
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:55,897
So that is also available on our website.

97
00:08:56,838 --> 00:09:01,682
It's part of the dropdown feature in the checkout process, which is super simple.

98
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:02,482
It's free.

99
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:05,405
You do not need an appointment to come and pick up your books.

100
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:17,110
You can just text us 10 minutes before you arrive at our store phone number and let us know that you're on your way with your order number and we'll have it ready for you within 10 minutes to pick up.

101
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,892
So we, curbside pickups, orders, we fulfill within 24 to 48 hours.

102
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:29,135
So we just ask customers to wait on us to let you know when your book order is ready.

103
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,295
So we just recommend that.

104
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,853
And we are constantly updating our inventory online.

105
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:35,997
So whatever is in store.

106
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:38,288
is also online, which is great.

107
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,151
So if you're not comfortable coming in the store, that's OK.

108
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:49,818
We have ways for you to still support us and to be able to gift very special book gifts or other gifts that we have.

109
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:50,739
We also have cards.

110
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,900
We also have ornaments.

111
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,505
We have other types of maker items that you can purchase and send to your loved ones.

112
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:02,489
The last and final thing is obviously in-store browsing appointments.

113
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:09,509
And what are your hours?

114
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,831
Our hours of, can you pause it?

115
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:14,412
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:15,813
I didn't realize that was going to happen.

117
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:16,734
I knew it would happen.

118
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,175
Hey, no worries.

119
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:20,296
You got another delivery of books.

120
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:20,856
You're busy.

121
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:21,797
Great.

122
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:22,337
I am.

123
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,578
But let me.

124
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:25,099
In-store appointments.

125
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:25,740
Yes.

126
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,800
So in-store appointments.

127
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:33,104
So we offer private in-store browsing appointments during our hours of operation.

128
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:33,785
So we are open.

129
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:50,170
Tuesday and Wednesdays, 12 to six, we're open Wednesday, Thursday through Saturday, 11 to seven, and Sundays, 11 to two and that's for the rest of the holiday season up until Christmas Eve, Christmas Eve we are closing at five.

130
00:10:51,590 --> 00:11:00,577
you can easily book your appointment online at allshearbooks.com backslash book dash online, which is a very easy process.

131
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:05,981
It's a 30 minute browsing appointment where you get pretty much my undivided attention for 30 minutes.

132
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:12,526
Or if you're the type of person that's like, I want to be amongst the shelves by myself, you can do that as well.

133
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:16,409
So it's totally up to you, but it allows for you to feel safe while browsing.

134
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,571
I haven't heard of that.

135
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:34,109
Yeah, it's it's not something that a lot of the bookstores do around here, and which is okay you know it's everybody has their own different ways of doing things, and it's totally fine I, you know, the only other one that does it that I'm aware of is paper cuts and JP.

136
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,532
So anyways, with that being said, it's a private shopping appointment.

137
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:48,416
You can also, for example, I've had customers that have decided to order things online, pick them up and do additional browsing as well, which you can totally do.

138
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:49,856
It's up to you.

139
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:52,157
And we can make that happen for you as well.

140
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:59,120
And also, if you're just a type of person that's like, I don't want to deal with booking an appointment online.

141
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,100
I'm not an email person.

142
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,240
That's okay.

143
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,100
Call the store.

144
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:09,403
If you have any questions, we're at 6 1 7 4 4 0 4 6 2 3 during our business hours.

145
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:15,745
Uh, which again are Tuesday through Wednesday, 12 to six Thursday through Saturday, 11 to seven.

146
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,786
And on Sunday is from 11 to two.

147
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:19,026
Amazing.

148
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,707
I'm so happy to meet you.

149
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,368
I love, I love your story.

150
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:25,589
Um, I can't wait to visit your shop.

151
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:26,629
Thank you.

152
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:27,329
Yeah.

153
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:27,869
Wonderful.

154
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,010
Thank you so much.

155
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,861
