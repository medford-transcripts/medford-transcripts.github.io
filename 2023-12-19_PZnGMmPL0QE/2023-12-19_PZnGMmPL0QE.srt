00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:25,380
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is the superintendent's updates and comments with special recognition of school committee members, Kathy Kretz for her eight years of service to the Medford Public Schools on the Medford School Committee, to member Mia Mastone, another eight years of service to the Medford Public Schools while serving on the Medford School Committee, and member Sharon Hayes with two years of wonderful service to the Medford Public Schools on our school committee.

69
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward-Gunson.

70
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

71
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:31,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening and happy holidays.

72
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:48,209
[SPEAKER_03]: In the midst of the December holiday season, many of us are reflecting on meaningful Hanukkah celebrations that took place last week, or looking forward to the winter solstice, Christmas, Kwanzaa, and a happy new year.

73
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:59,212
[SPEAKER_03]: On behalf of the Medford Public Schools, I wish the entire school community a safe, restful, and fun school break starting next week.

74
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:09,609
[SPEAKER_03]: As a reminder, this coming Friday is an early release day for all students, and we will return to classes on Tuesday, January 2nd.

75
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,301
[SPEAKER_03]: 2024, believe it or not.

76
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:16,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a brief MSB update.

77
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:28,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So before moving on to some special acknowledgements, I want to preview some exciting news regarding Medford's application to the Massachusetts School Building Authority's core program.

78
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:38,313
[SPEAKER_03]: On behalf of Medford High School, I'll be discussing the latest developments later on this evening as part of tonight's agenda.

79
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:48,753
[SPEAKER_03]: For our outgoing school committee members, I want to extend special thanks and acknowledgement.

80
00:21:50,214 --> 00:22:00,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight is a special and bittersweet occasion for the school committee because it's the final meeting for three of our dedicated school committee members.

81
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:13,128
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to recognize and thank them all, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to highlight the impact and accomplishments of each of these members.

82
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:16,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

83
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon Hayes.

84
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:33,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon Hayes joined the school committee after being elected in 2021, facing the daunting task of co-leading our school district through the post-pandemic recovery and readjustment period.

85
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:42,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Throughout her two years on the committee, member Hayes has always prioritized her values of transparency and equity.

86
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:54,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon promoted transparency in her work on formalizing the superintendent evaluation process and in sharing and explaining the work of the school committee in general.

87
00:22:56,145 --> 00:23:06,631
[SPEAKER_03]: She also maintained a strong belief in community voice, particularly the voices of students in school governance and leadership.

88
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:24,496
[SPEAKER_03]: She has challenged our entire district to always include the voices of all stakeholders through formal channels like surveys and advisory committees and through informal engagement by way of direct conversations and personal contact.

89
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:34,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hayes, I know that our school district will continue to prioritize this kind of vital community voice even after your tenure on the committee.

90
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:43,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of all, Sharon Hayes has been a constant advocate for equity in our school community.

91
00:23:44,574 --> 00:23:50,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon always strives to consider how decisions will affect stakeholders at every level.

92
00:23:50,896 --> 00:24:00,781
[SPEAKER_03]: This commitment to equity is particularly apparent in Sharon's active and earnest advocacy for school counseling and social emotional learning.

93
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:11,085
[SPEAKER_03]: She is dedicated to prioritizing these sometimes overlooked but essential parts of how our schools care for and educate the whole child.

94
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:20,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Sharon member Hayes, for your dedication to the students, employees and educators of the Medford Public Schools.

95
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the mayor has a special

96
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:37,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you have a beautiful gift over there, Member Hayes, and I have a citation and a little gift for myself.

97
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say thank you so much for your service.

98
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:49,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Two years of hard work and what you've done for the city, the school department, and for the children in the district.

99
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:57,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Marie said so eloquently, you've done so much for equity and making sure that the students have a voice at the table, and I think

100
00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:11,575
[SPEAKER_05]: The few of us that are remaining on the committee, you're always gonna have our phone numbers and push us to do certain things, but we're gonna keep up that strong fight for what's right, and through you, we'll be able to do that.

101
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:12,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

102
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Hayes, for serving for two great years.

103
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:27,547
[SPEAKER_03]: On behalf of the Medford Public Schools and the Medford School Committee, we do have a token of appreciation

104
00:25:28,715 --> 00:25:32,263
[SPEAKER_03]: should be due.

105
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:33,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hayes, would you like to?

106
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:36,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Fisher?

107
00:26:20,566 --> 00:26:25,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I would like to recognize member Kathy Kretz.

108
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:33,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathy Krutz has diligently served as a member of the school committee for the last eight years.

109
00:26:34,603 --> 00:26:44,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Throughout that time, Kathy has always been a representative and advocate, deeply engaged with the needs and priorities of Medford students.

110
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:53,790
[SPEAKER_03]: She always shows up for Medford's kids to support them, advocate for them, and cheer them towards their bright futures.

111
00:26:56,247 --> 00:27:16,074
[SPEAKER_03]: As a noted champion of our district's highly lauded career technical education programs, Kathy is known for her strong relationships with CTE staff, students, administrators, and others involved in these incredible and impactful programs.

112
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:23,617
[SPEAKER_03]: She is our community's ultimate advocate for experiential, hands-on learning.

113
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:33,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Kretz is well regarded throughout the Medford School community as a consistent, clearly spoken, reflective, and measured leader.

114
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone who listens carefully and makes thoughtful and even-handed decisions.

115
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:51,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking for myself, I am deeply grateful for the ways in which Kathy shares her abiding compassion and her particular love for both children and animals.

116
00:27:52,980 --> 00:28:06,189
[SPEAKER_03]: During stressful or eventful times over our tenure together in Medford, Kathy would sometimes share a photo or an anecdote about one of her beloved pets with me.

117
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:13,392
[SPEAKER_03]: creating wonderful opportunities for us to connect on a personal level, even during difficult moments.

118
00:28:14,773 --> 00:28:23,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Kathy, for your eight years of service to the students, employees, and educators of the Medford Public Schools.

119
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:46,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to echo just how amazing you have been the last eight years, and I've been lucky to be able to serve with you on the school committee for four of those.

120
00:28:46,431 --> 00:28:53,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of which were hard, the last two, post-pandemic, and the two prior were the hardest I've ever experienced.

121
00:28:53,413 --> 00:29:01,095
[SPEAKER_05]: But through the hard work of the committee and yourself, we got through it, and we got our kids back to school.

122
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:04,156
[SPEAKER_05]: We got them back safely with faculty and staff.

123
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:05,257
[SPEAKER_05]: We worked very hard.

124
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:06,197
[SPEAKER_05]: You worked very hard.

125
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to commend you for how thoughtful and prepared and calm you are.

126
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:19,505
[SPEAKER_05]: When there was a storm, your presence helped get us through that.

127
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:24,867
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for everything you've done for the city, the school, and the students the last eight years.

128
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:25,808
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

129
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:30,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

130
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you please come forward?

131
00:30:03,698 --> 00:30:08,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Last but definitely not least, Mia Mastone.

132
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:21,907
[SPEAKER_03]: As an eight-year member of the Medford School Committee, member Mia Mastone has made a deep mark on our school community as a true servant leader and an advocate for all students.

133
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:32,629
[SPEAKER_03]: recognizing that every child is unique and that we must seize every opportunity to improve students' success and well-being.

134
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:45,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McStone is always realistic, grounded, and focused, making sure that we never miss the chance to attain improvements and success in our schools.

135
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:47,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Throughout her tenure,

136
00:30:48,892 --> 00:31:00,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Mia always kept track of the pulse of the community across grade levels and disciplines, particularly as a constant and active champion for our fine and performing arts.

137
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:08,589
[SPEAKER_03]: As a parent and school committee member, Mia is deeply involved in and committed to student life.

138
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,552
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to her commitment to Medford students,

139
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:19,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Mia always prioritized making Medford Public Schools a great place to work.

140
00:31:19,977 --> 00:31:29,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Her fair-minded approach and commitment to all staff, from classroom teachers to paraprofessionals and cafeteria staff, have helped make our schools stronger and better.

141
00:31:31,468 --> 00:31:38,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Mia is a leader notable for her humility and thoughtfulness, sometimes the least likely to speak up in a meeting.

142
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:48,499
[SPEAKER_03]: All who know her share the confidence that anything she does, have to say, will be concise, direct, clear, and respectful.

143
00:31:49,560 --> 00:32:00,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I speak for all our school leaders when I thank member Mastone for always trusting and empowering our administrators and educators to do their jobs and to do the right thing.

144
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:04,870
[SPEAKER_03]: On a personal level, I share a great deal with Mia.

145
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:10,294
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a common high school alma mater, and Mia graduated with my sister.

146
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So we come from similar landscapes of experience and perspective.

147
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:25,834
[SPEAKER_03]: I have always admired Mia's deep conviction and her personal faith, which have clearly guided her work and service as a member of the Medford School Committee.

148
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:35,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mia, for your dedication and service to the students, employees, and educators of the Medford Public Schools.

149
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:50,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Bestone, thank you so much for your service the last eight years.

150
00:32:51,087 --> 00:32:59,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, like you said to Member Kratz and Member Hayes, tough two years and then extremely tough two years.

151
00:32:59,351 --> 00:32:59,991
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all tough.

152
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:10,716
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all tough, but it's a grind and you do it because, not because of the emails we get every day or the phone calls, but you do it because you're trying to make a difference.

153
00:33:11,377 --> 00:33:14,018
[SPEAKER_05]: You fought, since I've seen you every,

154
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:25,013
[SPEAKER_05]: other Monday night fought for equality and fairness and making sure that our students got what they need and make sure there was better pay for after school workers and paraprofessionals.

155
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:26,374
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've really led the charge.

156
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:31,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I admire your hard work and dedication to the city, the school and the students.

157
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:34,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And you all know you have our numbers and we're going to keep fighting.

158
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:35,398
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

159
00:33:55,475 --> 00:33:56,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a group picture.

160
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:00,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

161
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:04,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say much of what the superintendent already said.

162
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:11,060
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to thank each of my colleagues one at a time.

163
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:16,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Hayes has brought an understanding about literacy that, you know,

164
00:35:17,063 --> 00:35:19,305
[SPEAKER_00]: As a parent and school committee member, I could not have.

165
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:30,115
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that guidance around coaching and helping our teaching staff have what they needed was really important for us as we battled in the last budget.

166
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:32,117
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate that.

167
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:37,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little surprised it was only 31 months ago when we sat down at Tasty.

168
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:38,682
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't Tasty.

169
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:39,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the cafe?

170
00:35:40,524 --> 00:35:41,325
[SPEAKER_00]: classic cafe.

171
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:47,731
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems like just yesterday, but nothing else on school committee does.

172
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:49,813
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

173
00:35:53,834 --> 00:36:01,558
[SPEAKER_00]: but I hate saying member-crats, it feels fairly personal here, but Kathy, I've always appreciated your focus on the vocational program.

174
00:36:02,818 --> 00:36:08,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Having Noah inside the program for some of our years together has been helpful.

175
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:17,245
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did not go through a vocational program, so having you to keep bringing it up is really, really important.

176
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:19,647
[SPEAKER_00]: And your perspectives on that has

177
00:36:21,027 --> 00:36:24,889
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely helped a lot in many of our decisions, so thank you so much for that.

178
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:43,837
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, I found it amusing the superintendent used the word direct to describe Member McStone, but I like the word blunt because it's less refined, and not that you're less refined, but you were the one I was hardest to write some words for because

179
00:36:45,177 --> 00:36:49,198
[SPEAKER_00]: As some of you may know, Mia got me elected.

180
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of other people did too.

181
00:36:51,139 --> 00:37:02,863
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as I announced, or maybe you announced, I don't remember who announced me, she dragged me around to this every corner of this city, because she knew everyone.

182
00:37:02,883 --> 00:37:04,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say everyone,

183
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:06,547
[SPEAKER_00]: literally everyone.

184
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:14,134
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but it was fun because she wasn't, you know, she wasn't dragging around and just like leaving me in a corner.

185
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:14,834
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like,

186
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:20,647
[SPEAKER_00]: stick me in the face of every person that I might need to know or want to know.

187
00:37:21,728 --> 00:37:24,231
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can never say thank you enough for that.

188
00:37:25,572 --> 00:37:28,794
[SPEAKER_00]: But in all of that, also, I gained a lifelong friend.

189
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:37,562
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be difficult to not have you to look across and be like, oh my god, this meeting is still going on.

190
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:43,785
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

191
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:52,328
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's all I'm going to say now, but I'll say more later at dinner.

192
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:58,249
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for being my conscience sometimes.

193
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:00,190
[SPEAKER_00]: I did also want to say that like,

194
00:38:01,485 --> 00:38:12,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and I would come at many issues from incredibly different perspectives and I loved that we most of the time at least arrived at exactly the same conclusions or views on things.

195
00:38:13,454 --> 00:38:21,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was quite a learning experience to know that like people don't have to come at things from the same place to come to the same conclusion.

196
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:28,425
[SPEAKER_00]: which is sort of an important thing for a politician to know, but to know it and understand it and experience it is different.

197
00:38:29,186 --> 00:38:32,308
[SPEAKER_00]: So I greatly appreciated our many conversations.

198
00:38:32,428 --> 00:38:37,312
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, we didn't always agree on everything, but I will miss you greatly.

199
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:38,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

200
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:40,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Russo.

201
00:38:40,495 --> 00:38:40,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

202
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:42,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

203
00:38:44,077 --> 00:38:56,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Kretz or Kathy, I feel like we probably would have never known each other outside of school committee because our kids are very different ages and you live on the opposite side of town from me.

204
00:38:56,344 --> 00:38:58,425
[SPEAKER_07]: And so our paths just like naturally wouldn't have crossed.

205
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:05,229
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did get to know Kathy, particularly when we were going through the process of weighing the options for our next superintendent.

206
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:07,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And Kathy and I had a lot of conversations about

207
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:17,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what does Medford need and who are the candidates and who are the right candidates and I remember that we had one of those conversations, which was supposed to be quite short at snappy patties.

208
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:26,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had a we had a great conversation, it took a very long time and next time we go to snappy patties together we're going to have to insist that pat join us.

209
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:35,773
[SPEAKER_07]: in the conversation because he was like, oh, no, no, this is, you know, Kathy's working on business right now and I can't possibly join you.

210
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:39,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And so poor Pat sat there by himself for like two hours.

211
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:45,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So next time we'll have to like bring him into the fold when we go to Snappy Patty's.

212
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:49,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And I promise we will not forget about the vocational school while you're gone.

213
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:52,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we actually have lots of,

214
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:59,325
[SPEAKER_07]: super interesting opportunities when we talk about MSBA and I know we'll talk about that later tonight to really think about.

215
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:03,601
[SPEAKER_07]: vocational education and what it needs and what the possibilities are.

216
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:05,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm super excited for that.

217
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:09,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will not forget them, I promise.

218
00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:16,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hayes, again, like our kids are closer in age, but a little bit different age.

219
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,011
[SPEAKER_07]: They went to different schools.

220
00:40:18,031 --> 00:40:23,475
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really enjoyed campaigning with you and winning with you two years ago.

221
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:27,438
[SPEAKER_07]: That was certainly, it's always nice to win, but it's nice to win with friends.

222
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,979
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's super great.

223
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:40,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually found some of my notes from a really early conversation that Sharon and I had from even before we took office about some of the goals we had for a school committee.

224
00:40:40,216 --> 00:40:44,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And we actually accomplished so many of them in two short years.

225
00:40:44,217 --> 00:40:46,478
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually sort of nice to like take a look at it.

226
00:40:46,498 --> 00:40:52,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh, I need to save this for later when I'm feeling like we haven't, you know, when you always feel like you haven't done enough.

227
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:55,062
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nice to see just how many things we actually had completed.

228
00:40:55,102 --> 00:40:55,602
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

229
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:09,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mia, I wanted to sort of thank you for leading the way on constituent services, because I don't feel like that was a real priority of most of the committees before you.

230
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:19,720
[SPEAKER_07]: And in a district that has its warts and is imperfect at times, like that is such a critical role that we play.

231
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:34,686
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't happen in these meetings and it doesn't happen on the floor, but you spend countless hours with people talking about what their concerns are, how they can address them, providing guidance in terms of how parents can advocate for their kids.

232
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:37,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for leading the way.

233
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:42,350
[SPEAKER_07]: It's become a huge part of what the community expects the school committee members to do.

234
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:48,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that until we have a perfect school system, that's really, really important.

235
00:41:48,113 --> 00:41:48,974
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for that.

236
00:41:50,195 --> 00:42:02,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the other thing that you started, being the trendsetter that you are, was really both you and Kathy being school committee members that are also active parents with children enrolled in the school.

237
00:42:03,464 --> 00:42:13,592
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that is so important in terms of really understanding what the community is looking for, and from this seat, being able to represent

238
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:21,440
[SPEAKER_07]: not just what like your kids are going through, but what your, what your kids' friends are going through, um, sort of makes you a better school committee member in so many ways.

239
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:26,462
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for, um, pushing us all forward in that manner as well.

240
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:27,862
[SPEAKER_07]: You will all be missed.

241
00:42:28,362 --> 00:42:28,742
Thank you.

242
00:42:29,762 --> 00:42:30,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

243
00:42:30,122 --> 00:42:30,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

244
00:42:34,523 --> 00:42:37,224
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, oh, our second, yes.

245
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:40,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Student Noah Urasco.

246
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I say that right?

247
00:42:42,045 --> 00:42:42,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

248
00:42:42,605 --> 00:42:42,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

249
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:43,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

250
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,131
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any questions or you'd like to speak, just let us know.

251
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:59,619
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our second update from former school committee woman, Paulette van de Kloot on the Medford Educational Foundation presentation.

252
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:04,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Paulette is the president of the MEF and of course, former school committee member.

253
00:43:15,816 --> 00:43:18,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Oop, there we go, 146 Pine Ridge Road.

254
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:21,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I've not been on this side of the rail too often.

255
00:43:22,797 --> 00:43:25,358
[SPEAKER_08]: But this all seems vaguely familiar.

256
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:31,619
[SPEAKER_08]: So before I go on with the MEF, I first wanna assure you that there is life after school committee.

257
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:37,660
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the very first school committee meeting that I've attended after two years, because I've been so busy.

258
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,761
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a pleasure to see both the mayor, the superintendent,

259
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:48,742
[SPEAKER_08]: once fellow school committee members and school committee elect.

260
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:50,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations to you, by the way.

261
00:43:51,442 --> 00:44:10,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I did serve with two of you for six years, and Sharon, I didn't get to serve with you, but it was a great comfort when I left knowing that you were going to take the seat because I knew you had diligently prepared by coming to so many school committee meetings that you knew your stuff and you could step right in.

262
00:44:11,626 --> 00:44:14,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So while I didn't get to serve with you, I'm certainly grateful to you.

263
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:19,538
[SPEAKER_08]: To Kathy, Kathy, oh my God, so much time spent together.

264
00:44:19,558 --> 00:44:23,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, a couple of words kept on coming up.

265
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:24,584
[SPEAKER_08]: One, diligent.

266
00:44:25,618 --> 00:44:35,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, Kathy was the most careful about preparing for every meeting, making sure she had read and understood everything and had thought thoroughly through.

267
00:44:36,162 --> 00:44:38,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Just amazing dedication.

268
00:44:38,462 --> 00:44:51,347
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, one of the things that really stands out to me is being able to meet your husband and of course your incredible son Noah, who became a friend and who we enjoyed seeing all the time and who I still see his

269
00:44:51,926 --> 00:44:55,748
[SPEAKER_08]: posts and whatever, and he's, of course, continuing doing wonderful volunteer work.

270
00:44:56,128 --> 00:44:57,389
[SPEAKER_08]: So hello to Noah.

271
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:04,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure the time now has come where you'll really get to relax and you worked so hard.

272
00:45:04,293 --> 00:45:05,694
[SPEAKER_08]: You really deserve it, Kathy.

273
00:45:05,754 --> 00:45:07,175
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much.

274
00:45:08,155 --> 00:45:12,978
[SPEAKER_08]: And to Mia, when I thought about you, there's one word that stands out for me.

275
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:18,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Not blunt, but moral.

276
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:34,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember in those first two years when we serve together, which there was some really difficult times, because, yeah, there were some difficult times in the other, you know, pandemic and everything, but there were some really difficult times, and you led.

277
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:44,365
[SPEAKER_08]: with a deep moral sense that I just really think was wonderful, because there was a lot of pressure.

278
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:47,788
[SPEAKER_08]: And I so appreciated that from you.

279
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:54,395
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, with you, it's been a delight to meet all your family members, your husband Tim, to watch the kids grow.

280
00:45:54,995 --> 00:46:04,239
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's one of the things that as we, you know, sometimes forget there's a real, when we're working together every week and over the years, you get to know everybody's family.

281
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,481
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, congratulations to you.

282
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:10,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this has been a long time coming and I know you're going to enjoy it.

283
00:46:10,743 --> 00:46:21,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And just in case you get bored now, you and I have already talked about it, but Kathy, you know, and Sharon, the Medford Educational Foundation is looking for more members and,

284
00:46:22,248 --> 00:46:29,294
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like right now to invite you to join us because we have this fantastic little group of dedicated people.

285
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:31,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are not here tonight, some of them I'll introduce.

286
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:36,641
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've been working sort of behind the scenes for roughly seven years.

287
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:39,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have to go back and figure it out sometime.

288
00:46:40,905 --> 00:46:43,787
[SPEAKER_08]: The Medford Educational Foundation was started

289
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:57,602
[SPEAKER_08]: way long ago, maybe 20 plus 25 years, by the late, great Bob Gilligan, attorney Bob Gilligan, and Gene Bralt, or Len Bralt, excuse me.

290
00:46:58,442 --> 00:47:02,104
[SPEAKER_08]: It lasted for a couple of years, and then it kind of went by the wayside.

291
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:13,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Ann Kasuth and I resurrected it about seven or eight years ago, and we've been working behind the scenes ever since that time.

292
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:30,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, tonight, on behalf of the Medford Educational Foundation, I am writing you to formally ask you to accept a donation to the Medford Public Schools to cover the specific grants that we are able to fund at this time.

293
00:47:31,755 --> 00:47:43,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Each year, we have two times during the year where we accept applications from teachers, and we ask them either to apply for a grant of zero to $200

294
00:47:45,385 --> 00:47:47,989
[SPEAKER_08]: or another grant from $200 to $2,000.

295
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:51,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And we accept those grants.

296
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:56,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And then as a body, we deliberate on the grants.

297
00:47:56,222 --> 00:47:58,305
[SPEAKER_08]: We check out with the schools that

298
00:47:59,136 --> 00:48:07,560
[SPEAKER_08]: The projects are consistent with the educational values and direction that the school system must go in or is going in.

299
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:20,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And Diane Caldwell, who of course you guys all know, has been extremely helpful in being a partner with us and volunteering her time so that we could make these grants.

300
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:36,491
[SPEAKER_08]: This December, we received over 38 requests from teachers who outlined specific projects or requests that they believe would enhance their students' learning experience.

301
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:50,246
[SPEAKER_08]: While we would have loved to fund each and every one of them, we met as a group and decided which grants we could fund in their entirety, which grants we could partially fund, and sadly, which grants we couldn't afford at this time.

302
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:55,649
[SPEAKER_08]: The December application cycle yielded more than $24,000 in requests, and we have been able to fund $13,058.86.

303
00:49:07,307 --> 00:49:15,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So tonight, we're asking you to approve our donation, and I do want to mention that we've done this before but we haven't been asked to present it to you.

304
00:49:16,137 --> 00:49:20,762
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also gave over $10,000 in the spring for example too.

305
00:49:21,483 --> 00:49:26,528
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we would not be able to do the work we do with the support of our donors.

306
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:40,195
[SPEAKER_08]: we want to acknowledge the generosity of Needham Bank, and especially Vice President and Branch Manager, Jean Kalau, who presented us with a total donation of over $10,000 this year.

307
00:49:40,275 --> 00:49:41,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And... This is Jean.

308
00:49:41,256 --> 00:49:45,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Jean, stand up.

309
00:49:45,218 --> 00:49:45,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Jean.

310
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:59,937
[SPEAKER_08]: This connection between us and Jean was because of Mia.

311
00:50:01,219 --> 00:50:06,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we are extremely appreciative for that because it sure has helped this year.

312
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:09,689
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can see, our requests are steadily increasing.

313
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:12,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, it's, you know, we need more money.

314
00:50:12,653 --> 00:50:13,594
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more money, Jean.

315
00:50:16,212 --> 00:50:29,942
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and let's see, I wrote, the Medford Education Foundation has kept a low profile, but has been receiving, reviewing, and funding grants to teachers over the last seven years.

316
00:50:30,543 --> 00:50:39,910
[SPEAKER_08]: This coming year, we hope to share our good news more widely as we anticipate the need to raise more funds for the many requests we find ourselves receiving.

317
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:43,371
[SPEAKER_08]: That is code for don't be surprised if you get a letter.

318
00:50:45,812 --> 00:50:53,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I'd just like to take a second to acknowledge the rest of the members I have with me.

319
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:55,736
[SPEAKER_08]: David Sayers, David

[SPEAKER_08]: In the second row, Stephen Hayes.

322
00:51:00,101 --> 00:51:03,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Stephen Hayes makes sure that all the money is aligned.

323
00:51:03,484 --> 00:51:09,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, we have been working with Jerry McHugh and Noel Velez right now.

324
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:17,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wish I had one of those big checks, but we know better to waste money on this, on necessities.

325
00:51:18,135 --> 00:51:20,697
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's the check and they're not here.

326
00:51:20,757 --> 00:51:22,538
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess superintendent, I'm going to give it to you.

327
00:51:24,451 --> 00:51:25,992
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there a motion for approval for acceptance?

328
00:51:26,012 --> 00:51:27,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a motion for approval?

329
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't give it.

330
00:51:28,353 --> 00:51:29,153

[SPEAKER_08]: So now I can officially hand it over.

338
00:51:41,778 --> 00:51:42,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Steve should really be up here.

339

340
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:10,230
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we hope after we closed our time period for receiving the grants, we received several more on top of that.

[SPEAKER_08]: And the other place where we've had donations, apart from private donations, which we also

00:59:51,773 --> 00:59:52,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I enjoy working with you.

416
00:59:54,006 --> 00:59:56,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna give a few updates for career tech education.

417
00:59:56,907 --> 01:00:11,714
[SPEAKER_01]: The first that I have up is a picture of a community project that we took on and the letter basically states, it's a family in the community that had a family member who was unfortunately bedridden and there was access issues going in and out of the home.

418
01:00:12,294 --> 01:00:16,856
[SPEAKER_01]: So when two teachers came to me and asked for my permission, I gave it our blessing right away.

419
01:00:17,437 --> 01:00:20,458
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to use a lot of the stock that we had in the carpentry shop

420
01:00:20,854 --> 01:00:28,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a collaboration between our carpentry students, our construction students, and our metal fabrication students who built a metal ramp off the door.

421
01:00:29,219 --> 01:00:31,960
[SPEAKER_01]: This really was work that makes everyone feel good.

422
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,901
[SPEAKER_01]: The students definitely enjoyed it.

423
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:35,182
[SPEAKER_01]: The teachers enjoyed it.

424
01:00:35,362 --> 01:00:38,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that we were able to help someone in the community get in and out of their home.

425
01:00:39,628 --> 01:00:40,589
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one project.

426
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:46,715
[SPEAKER_01]: The next slide is an update on we have done completed for sheds.

427
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:52,541
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking for the finest built shed this side of the Mississippi, look no further.

428
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:57,146
[SPEAKER_01]: We have started this last year so we're on our fourth shed right now.

429
01:00:59,141 --> 01:01:04,967
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the launch to really be able being able to do more building projects in the community.

430
01:01:05,307 --> 01:01:09,071
[SPEAKER_01]: So even prior to this we had done a few pantries for people in the community.

431
01:01:09,592 --> 01:01:16,679
[SPEAKER_01]: But what this is allowing students to do is use the tools that we purchased through grants load up the trailers and trucks and head out to a job site.

432
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,942
[SPEAKER_01]: The construction craft labor students were able to.

433
01:01:20,883 --> 01:01:47,221
[SPEAKER_01]: lay the cement padding for the shed which if you've done a shed you know that that really is key it's better to have it on that than you know crushed stone or dirt so these certainly will last a long time and the carpentry students complete the build a lot of it in the shop and then we'll transport it to the job site and this was a collaborative effort between both of them so we're very proud that we just completed our fourth and as you can see from the pictures these are beautiful sheds so now that we kind of

434
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,461
[SPEAKER_01]: have a year under our belt.

435
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:51,262
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be opening it up more to the community.

436
01:01:51,282 --> 01:01:53,202
[SPEAKER_01]: We think we can take on a few more next year.

437
01:01:53,222 --> 01:01:58,025
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already worked with Dr. Cushing for a request for some of the elementary schools that need some storage sheds.

438
01:01:58,045 --> 01:01:59,486
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be taking that on in the spring.

439
01:02:04,448 --> 01:02:16,834
[SPEAKER_01]: The last update is something that we participate in every year, and it's something, it's really a wonderful event that's held at the electricians union in Dorchester, and it's a women in trades conference.

440
01:02:17,546 --> 01:02:19,828
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was fitting to have the picture in the upper left.

441
01:02:19,848 --> 01:02:25,111
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of our students in carpentry, who is a female student in a predominantly male trade.

442
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:27,392
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought, what better picture to throw up there.

443
01:02:27,753 --> 01:02:29,734
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, they have so much fun at the job site.

444
01:02:29,874 --> 01:02:35,277
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really comical when the teacher sends me the pictures at the end of the day, because no one is not smiling.

445
01:02:35,638 --> 01:02:38,680
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been, you know, the weather is unpredictable and they still have a great time.

446
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:46,825
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Women in Trade Conference was led, many different vendors were there from many different unions in the state, in the city.

447
01:02:47,606 --> 01:02:55,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And just providing that encouragement for all people to know that there really is no barrier when it comes to the career you choose.

448
01:02:55,573 --> 01:02:57,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one in particular was for our female students.

449
01:02:59,537 --> 01:03:03,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be the last one.

450
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an update on some of our cooperative education employers.

451
01:03:06,744 --> 01:03:07,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we have

452
01:03:08,143 --> 01:03:11,464
[SPEAKER_01]: just about half of the senior class out on cooperative education.

453
01:03:11,504 --> 01:03:14,284
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a reminder, co-op is always a paid position.

454
01:03:14,344 --> 01:03:16,445
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't put anyone out on unpaid positions.

455
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:22,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the newest partners we secured is Spalding Hospital, Mass General and Volkswagen at Watertown.

456
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:29,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So for our students, they're not going out to, you know, little jobs here.

457
01:03:29,328 --> 01:03:32,689
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going out to some of the major hospitals in the area and some

458
01:03:34,508 --> 01:03:35,709
[SPEAKER_01]: some great opportunities.

459
01:03:35,749 --> 01:03:39,892
[SPEAKER_01]: We even have a student who's doing, she's in health assisting, but she wants to pursue dentistry.

460
01:03:39,952 --> 01:03:43,095
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's working at a dental office being a dental assistant.

461
01:03:43,635 --> 01:03:46,597
[SPEAKER_01]: So co-op is definitely a hallmark of the program for seniors.

462
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:52,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is an update from CTE and Medford High School.

463
01:04:00,568 --> 01:04:01,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions or are we?

464
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:04,694
[SPEAKER_05]: No, thank you so much for the presentation.

465
01:04:04,734 --> 01:04:05,395
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

466
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:19,449
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an exciting update from our superintendent of schools regarding Medford High School's invitation to the MSBA eligibility phase.

467
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:21,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward Vincent.

468
01:04:22,509 --> 01:04:26,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm so excited to share this news.

469
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:50,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week, after years of applying for the program, Medford High School was invited into phase one of the Massachusetts School Building Authority's core program, which provides substantial reimbursement as high as 60% of all project costs for the renovation or rebuilding of schools.

470
01:04:52,180 --> 01:05:15,722
[SPEAKER_03]: We are grateful to Massachusetts Treasurer Deb Goldberg, the MSBA Board of Directors, and our state legislators, Senator Pat Jalen, and Representatives Christine Barber, Paul Donato, and Sean Garbally, for their commitment to city-state partnership on this important priority.

471
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:29,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you also to the countless Medford High School, MHS and district staff, educators who worked hard on our statement of interest to the MSBA.

472
01:05:30,906 --> 01:05:38,567
[SPEAKER_03]: We also extend a special thanks to the school committee and the city of Medford for your continued support with this process.

473
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:46,609
[SPEAKER_03]: On Thursday, Medford participated in the first orientation session with MSBA.

474
01:05:48,086 --> 01:05:59,294
[SPEAKER_03]: We're beginning to learn about the timeline, criteria, and process for phase one of the core program, and we're ready to hit the ground running in 2024.

475
01:05:59,514 --> 01:06:03,698
[SPEAKER_03]: We're only at the very beginning of this process.

476
01:06:04,398 --> 01:06:07,281
[SPEAKER_03]: which will truly kick into gear next spring.

477
01:06:07,941 --> 01:06:13,146
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, we are excited and pleased to celebrate this milestone.

478
01:06:13,766 --> 01:06:24,475
[SPEAKER_03]: In the new year, we'll begin to discuss in greater detail the timeline, priorities, and other steps to advance this great opportunity.

479
01:06:32,554 --> 01:06:33,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

480
01:06:33,778 --> 01:06:34,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Russo?

481
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:35,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.

482
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:37,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I attended the orientation on Thursday.

483
01:06:38,359 --> 01:06:42,500
[SPEAKER_00]: just feels like three weeks ago at this point, but it was very interesting.

484
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,501
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 70 people on the Zoom.

485
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:53,302
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of an interesting way to orient because every single person there surely had two hours worth of questions.

486
01:06:54,383 --> 01:07:00,004
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to future smaller scale orientations where we can actually ask our questions.

487
01:07:00,084 --> 01:07:04,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that was a little overwhelming that there were 19 communities invited in

488
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,462
[SPEAKER_00]: which apparently is more than normal, quite a bit more than normal.

489
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:18,747
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also think we should thank tax revenues that allowed them to have a bigger budget this year, because that's just an unprecedented number.

490
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:26,731
[SPEAKER_00]: In the presentation they gave us, they said there were $2 billion worth of projects in this 19 schools.

491
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:27,892
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 2 billion, right?

492
01:07:29,048 --> 01:07:31,290
[SPEAKER_00]: One or two, I thought it was two, but maybe it was only one.

493
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:33,892
[SPEAKER_00]: One billion, two billion, big numbers.

494
01:07:34,152 --> 01:07:40,438
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we can get that many schools for one billion, but so it's very exciting.

495
01:07:41,078 --> 01:07:46,963
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to this very stringent process that we must go through and deadlines we must meet.

496
01:07:47,164 --> 01:07:54,650
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hopeful we can beat the deadlines because most of the deadlines are things that are like, there's like a deadline, but if we can get it done early,

497
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:57,582
[SPEAKER_00]: can be early and I like early.

498
01:07:57,842 --> 01:08:03,907
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very excited to take the five to seven year project and make it four to five maybe.

499
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,408
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be nice.

500
01:08:05,588 --> 01:08:06,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you member Rousseau.

501
01:08:06,769 --> 01:08:07,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

502
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:08,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

503
01:08:10,272 --> 01:08:10,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Same.

504
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:18,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to moving as quickly as possible and we were at the school committee conference back in November before MSBA had

505
01:08:19,451 --> 01:08:20,952
[SPEAKER_07]: made their final decisions.

506
01:08:21,092 --> 01:08:28,417
[SPEAKER_07]: And I asked that question of them, which is how do we, what advice do you have for communities who are ready to move?

507
01:08:28,477 --> 01:08:37,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we are, you know, long past the time where we should have been starting this through a whole variety of unfortunate events, but here we are.

508
01:08:38,024 --> 01:08:42,727
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I can say is that there's just a lot of work ahead, but that

509
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:48,271
[SPEAKER_07]: this first step is critical because now we get to move as quick as possible.

510
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:58,594
[SPEAKER_07]: So until now we sort of haven't been able to do that unless we were as a community sort of flush with hundreds of millions of dollars to build a school on our own.

511
01:08:59,215 --> 01:09:02,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And that hasn't gone great for other communities who have gone down that path.

512
01:09:02,836 --> 01:09:08,017
[SPEAKER_07]: So the eligibility period though is pretty pivotal from a scoping perspective.

513
01:09:08,097 --> 01:09:10,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of things that have to happen in the next

514
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:11,859
[SPEAKER_07]: x months.

515
01:09:11,959 --> 01:09:13,961
[SPEAKER_07]: We have 270 days to do this work.

516
01:09:15,463 --> 01:09:21,390
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are some really important questions that we'll talk about as a district and as a community.

517
01:09:21,923 --> 01:09:24,083
[SPEAKER_07]: including things like what are our enrollment projections?

518
01:09:24,444 --> 01:09:26,824
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of vocational programs do we wanna have?

519
01:09:27,104 --> 01:09:28,464
[SPEAKER_07]: What is our capacity right now?

520
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:32,045
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we want our capacity to be in those programs in this new building?

521
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:44,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically sort of all the things that go into deciding what size space is going to go out to the bidders to say, now we need you to tell us what is feasible, right?

522
01:09:44,608 --> 01:09:50,949
[SPEAKER_07]: But the other sort of things that are, I think we're lucky enough to have incorporated in our bid are things like,

523
01:09:51,547 --> 01:09:53,089
[SPEAKER_07]: What about our pre-K programs?

524
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:58,975
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have just a huge strategic opportunity because we have pre-K programs in that building today.

525
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:06,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And our invitation included the acknowledgement that we had programs like the MFN in there.

526
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:11,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have several preschool programs with Kids Corner and then with the vocational school.

527
01:10:13,364 --> 01:10:17,726
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have an opportunity to talk about how to best serve our students at Curtis Tufts.

528
01:10:18,566 --> 01:10:24,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Transporting them across the city for some of the opportunities that they might want to take advantage of is a huge challenge.

529
01:10:24,528 --> 01:10:25,749
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be talking about that.

530
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:42,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we will also in this eligibility phase be talking about how do we maintain our spaces and what are our plans and how can we promise and demonstrate to the MSBA that we'll be good stewards of the state's money when this building comes to fruition.

531
01:10:43,145 --> 01:10:46,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also in this phase, we will form a building committee.

532
01:10:46,989 --> 01:10:48,771
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the requirements of the phase.

533
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:50,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where we will look.

534
01:10:50,968 --> 01:10:53,731
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of requirements to meet even in forming a committee.

535
01:10:54,151 --> 01:10:57,795
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a really like specific set of individuals that have to be involved.

536
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:02,520
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is our opportunity to say how do we want to do this together in Medford.

537
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,283
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of that is coming in the eligibility phase.

538
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:10,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a lot of people have asked a lot of questions about like, is it a new school?

539
01:11:10,322 --> 01:11:11,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a revised school?

540
01:11:11,723 --> 01:11:12,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it at the high school?

541
01:11:12,824 --> 01:11:13,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it on the field?

542
01:11:13,724 --> 01:11:14,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it in a different location?

543
01:11:15,446 --> 01:11:19,969
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those questions don't start to get asked and answered until the eligibility phase is over.

544
01:11:20,089 --> 01:11:26,374
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this initial phase really sets up sort of the bones of the scope of the project.

545
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:32,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that feasibility study that happens next will actually allow us to say what is possible.

546
01:11:32,774 --> 01:11:33,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, what do we want to do?

547
01:11:34,155 --> 01:11:36,157
[SPEAKER_07]: What, what do we want to do and how could we do it?

548
01:11:36,197 --> 01:11:39,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So that feasibility study happens at the conclusion of eligibility.

549
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so we don't have those answers just yet.

550
01:11:43,302 --> 01:11:47,265
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want people to know it's nobody's, um, nobody's got any secret answers.

551
01:11:47,545 --> 01:11:52,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, they, they truly don't exist yet because we will hire, um, professionals.

552
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,171
[SPEAKER_07]: We will hire an owner's project manager.

553
01:11:54,191 --> 01:11:55,011
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll hire architects.

554
01:11:55,371 --> 01:12:02,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Those folks will help us based on this eligibility work that we're doing really thoughtfully to say, here's how you meet those needs.

555
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:05,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what your choices are as a community.

556
01:12:05,762 --> 01:12:09,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, here's how you can sort of move forward into the building phase.

557
01:12:09,483 --> 01:12:14,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're a bit away from some of those questions, but we're going to move as fast as we can to get there.

558
01:12:14,945 --> 01:12:19,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think that's the, those are the real questions people are impatient to ask and answer.

559
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:20,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And I totally get it.

560
01:12:21,487 --> 01:12:29,109
[SPEAKER_07]: My daughter will definitely not graduate from any sort of a revised school and like, fingers crossed, if we move really fast, Lucas might make it.

561
01:12:29,898 --> 01:12:42,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and so I'm super sensitive to the generation of kids that has, um, not had the benefit of, um, some sort of beautiful new building and, and it's sort of incumbent on all of us to figure out how do we move as fast as possible.

562
01:12:42,448 --> 01:12:44,570
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are as few of those kids as possible out there.

563
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Graham.

564
01:12:46,631 --> 01:12:52,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And just from the chair, if I may, I just want to thank everybody that had anything to do with this process.

565
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:58,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it started for us two years ago with our last application and making sure we had a strong application.

566
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:00,209
[SPEAKER_05]: all the way through to now.

567
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:09,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a number of us on the committee were on those calls this last week, and we're going to be following the process and helping them how we can with our Dr. Edward Vinson leading the charge.

568
01:13:10,137 --> 01:13:13,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to get this done and get it hopefully done sooner than five to seven years.

569
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,800
[SPEAKER_05]: We're so excited.

570
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:22,166
[SPEAKER_05]: It is beyond time for our students and faculty and staff to have a building that they deserve, that is conducive to

571
01:13:23,059 --> 01:13:25,181
[SPEAKER_05]: learning in a better environment than they have now.

572
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:26,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're excited.

573
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:28,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, some good news.

574
01:13:28,824 --> 01:13:30,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So wonderful.

575
01:13:31,847 --> 01:13:32,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

576
01:13:32,267 --> 01:13:32,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody.

577
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:39,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, we do not have any presentations of the public, continued business or new business.

578
01:13:40,014 --> 01:13:44,798
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have a reports requested by member Hayes and member McLaughlin.

579
01:13:44,818 --> 01:13:50,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm reminded if I read it, whereas the Memphis School Committee passed resolutions

580
01:13:50,976 --> 01:14:12,367
[SPEAKER_05]: on 12-6-21 and 11-7-22 to provide funding for an assessment of Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School to include recommendations to address moving forward in a manner that prioritizes a healthy school community and outline organizational, structural, professional development and curriculum-based changes needed to address the findings and achieve our district-wide mission.

581
01:14:12,927 --> 01:14:15,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas an assessment was completed by Mr. Welch in the spring of 2023,

582
01:14:17,281 --> 01:14:38,127
[SPEAKER_05]: the findings and recommendations discussed at school committee on 5-1-23 and 6-12-23 be resolved that the Metropolitan Public Schools Administration will provide a presentation by the end of February 2024 to update progress on the following recommendations provided by Mr. Welch's report and during subsequent school committee meetings with Mr. Welch.

[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, creation of MHS committees recommended in report

584

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

603
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:22,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hayes, would you like to speak on it or do you want a motion for approval?

604
01:16:22,981 --> 01:16:26,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a motion for approval.

605
01:16:28,305 --> 01:16:28,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

606
01:16:28,665 --> 01:16:33,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you spent hours on that and with the admin and we look forward to the presentation

607
01:16:34,315 --> 01:16:40,939
[SPEAKER_05]: February, there's a motion on the floor by Member Hayes, seconded by Member McStone.

608
01:16:40,999 --> 01:16:41,840
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

609
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:45,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we do that, before rolls, ask some questions.

610
01:16:45,582 --> 01:16:46,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Called Member Graham.

611
01:16:47,164 --> 01:16:48,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

612
01:16:48,745 --> 01:16:53,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I am generally supportive of getting a report that does many of these things.

613
01:16:54,862 --> 01:17:04,989
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are some things on this list that A, are not appropriate for the administration to weigh in on because they are subject to negotiations, which are held by the school committee.

614
01:17:05,949 --> 01:17:14,055
[SPEAKER_07]: There are others on this list that talk about the vision for MHS, which I believe will be handled in the,

615
01:17:15,433 --> 01:17:16,873
[SPEAKER_07]: when we talk about the building committee.

616
01:17:17,013 --> 01:17:35,259
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to make a motion to sever items two, three, four, and nine from this, because I just don't think it's appropriate for this committee on its way out the door to be describing or dictating the future bargaining position of the committee that they will not be a part of.

617
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:43,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So bargaining negotiations are a whole strategy and deciding one piece of a strategy in advance of

618
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:49,622
[SPEAKER_07]: a new and entirely new committee that's gonna take a seat, I think is not appropriate at this time for this committee.

619
01:17:49,642 --> 01:17:54,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to make a motion to sever two, three, four, and nine from the motion.

620
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:59,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

621
01:17:59,684 --> 01:18:03,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to sever by member Graham, seconded by member Russo.

622
01:18:03,744 --> 01:18:04,745
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

623
01:18:05,285 --> 01:18:05,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

624
01:18:06,445 --> 01:18:07,245
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

625
01:18:10,146 --> 01:18:12,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Please mark member Hayes as opposed.

626
01:18:20,545 --> 01:18:29,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a motion on the floor to approve everything that wasn't taken out or severed by member, Ms.

627
01:18:29,147 --> 01:18:30,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Stone, seconded by member Hayes.

628
01:18:30,628 --> 01:18:33,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So roll call vote on everything except two, three, four, nine.

629
01:18:36,469 --> 01:18:36,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham?

630
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:37,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

631
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:38,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Hayes?

632
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:39,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

633
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:40,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Kraft?

634
01:18:40,911 --> 01:18:41,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

635
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:43,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Coffin-Zappa and member Ms.

636
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:43,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Stone?

637
01:18:44,312 --> 01:18:44,512
Yes.

638
01:18:44,732 --> 01:18:45,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Rousseau, yes.

639
01:18:45,732 --> 01:18:46,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor Longo, correct?

640
01:18:46,832 --> 01:18:47,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

641
01:18:47,432 --> 01:18:48,833
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

642
01:18:51,118 --> 01:18:51,598
[SPEAKER_05]: as severed.

643
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:52,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor?

644
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:54,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Russo?

645
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:05,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm just wondering, and we can get this later, but this doesn't have an item number on this, and usually those are created when the items are submitted, so if somebody could get that to me.

646
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:13,391
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Member Hayes got that when she submitted it, or if the administration has it, but like, you know, the 2023-whatever.

647
01:19:15,712 --> 01:19:24,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was sent as a requested report, so that was why I hadn't put it as a resolution, because we were using the numbers for resolutions.

648
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:30,685
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can actually start maybe a new number for requested reports.

649
01:19:30,946 --> 01:19:33,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in our rules, they just get the same number.

650
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:34,148
[SPEAKER_00]: The same number?

651
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:34,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.

652
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:35,490
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do.

653
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:37,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because the votes and the notes will need that.

654
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:39,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll do.

655
01:19:39,253 --> 01:19:39,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

656
01:19:44,096 --> 01:19:46,216
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a number of condolences.

657
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:56,959
[SPEAKER_05]: The members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Marie Christine Perdillo, an elementary teacher for 30 years for the Medford Public Schools.

658
01:19:58,539 --> 01:20:07,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Janet Valentin, mother of Donna Lasky, an elementary teacher at the McGlynn School.

659
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:19,438
[SPEAKER_05]: The members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Elmer L. Counts, husband of Shirley Counts, retired principal of the Brooks Hobbs School.

660
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:32,890
[SPEAKER_05]: And the members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Daniel Jendrew of Lakeville, cousin of Medford High School assistant principal, Shayla Freitas-Haley.

661
01:20:33,731 --> 01:20:37,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And last, the members of the Medford School Committee express its sincerest condolences

662
01:20:37,978 --> 01:20:48,124
[SPEAKER_05]: to the family of Marjorie A. Sanford, who was in the Medford High School class of 1953 and was a secretary in both the Swan Elementary and Roberts Junior High School for many years.

663
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:50,425
[SPEAKER_05]: If we all may rise for a moment of silence, please.

664
01:21:02,432 --> 01:21:02,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

665
01:21:05,506 --> 01:21:08,587
[SPEAKER_05]: We wish everybody a wonderful holiday season.

666
01:21:09,528 --> 01:21:17,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next scheduled meeting will be January 8th, 2024 in the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, and via Zoom.

667
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:21,013
[SPEAKER_05]: The inauguration is January 7th, which is the Sunday at 10 a.m.

668
01:21:21,614 --> 01:21:27,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Please join us here at the Alden Chambers for that, and if there's no other business, a motion to adjourn?

669
01:21:29,357 --> 01:21:32,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I move for press, seconded by member Hayes.

670
01:21:32,599 --> 01:21:33,279
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?
