    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1770.169s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1770.43s">Can</a>  you please come forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1803.698s">Last</a>  but definitely not least, Mia Mastone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1809.701s">As</a>  an eight-year member of the Medford School Committee, member Mia Mastone has made a deep mark on our school community as a true servant leader and an advocate for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1823.127s">recognizing</a>  that every child is unique and that we must seize every opportunity to improve students' success and well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1833.689s">Member</a>  Mustone is always realistic, grounded, and focused, making sure that we never miss the chance to attain improvements and success in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1846.972s">Throughout</a>  her tenure, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1848.892s">Mia</a>  always kept track of the pulse of the community across grade levels and disciplines, particularly as a constant and active champion for our fine and performing arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1861.683s">As</a>  a parent and school committee member, Mia is deeply involved in and committed to student life. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1869.97s">In</a>  addition to her commitment to Medford students, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1873.513s">Mia</a>  always prioritized making Medford Public Schools a great place to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1879.977s">Her</a>  fair-minded approach and commitment to all staff, from classroom teachers to paraprofessionals and cafeteria staff, have helped make our schools stronger and better. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1891.468s">Mia</a>  is a leader notable for her humility and thoughtfulness, sometimes the least likely to speak up in a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1899.593s">All</a>  who know her share the confidence that anything she does, have to say, will be concise, direct, clear, and respectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1909.56s">I</a>  know I speak for all our school leaders when I thank member Mastone for always trusting and empowering our administrators and educators to do their jobs and to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1921.768s">On</a>  a personal level, I share a great deal with Mia. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1925.531s">We</a>  have a common high school alma mater, and Mia graduated with my sister. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1931.054s">So</a>  we come from similar landscapes of experience and perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1935.586s">I</a>  have always admired Mia's deep conviction and her personal faith, which have clearly guided her work and service as a member of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1946.935s">Thank</a>  you, Mia, for your dedication and service to the students, employees, and educators of the Medford Public Schools.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1967.025s">Member</a>  Bestone, thank you so much for your service the last eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1971.087s">Again,</a>  like you said to Member Kreatz and Member Hays, tough two years and then extremely tough two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1979.351s">They're</a>  all tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1980.592s">They're</a>  all tough, but it's a grind and you do it because, not because of the emails we get every day or the phone calls, but you do it because you're trying to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1991.377s">You</a>  fought, since I've seen you every, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1994.788s">other</a>  Monday night fought for equality and fairness and making sure that our students got what they need and make sure there was better pay for after school workers and paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2005.093s">And</a>  you've really led the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2006.454s">I</a>  admire your hard work and dedication to the city, the school and the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2012.016s">And</a>  you all know you have our numbers and we're going to keep fighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2014.938s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2035.475s">Take</a>  a group picture.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2100.416s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2102.036s">I</a>  was going to say much of what the superintendent already said. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2107.139s">But</a>  I just want to thank each of my colleagues one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2111.08s">Member</a>  Hays has brought an understanding about literacy that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2117.063s">As</a>  a parent and school committee member, I could not have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2120.026s">And</a>  I think that that guidance around coaching and helping our teaching staff have what they needed was really important for us as we battled in the last budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2130.635s">So</a>  I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2132.997s">I'm</a>  a little surprised it was only 31 months ago when we sat down at Tasty. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2137.561s">No,</a>  it wasn't Tasty. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2138.723s">Where's</a>  the cafe? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2140.524s">classic</a>  cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2142.626s">And</a>  that seems like just yesterday, but nothing else on school committee does. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2149.293s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2153.834s">but</a>  I hate saying member-crats, it feels fairly personal here, but Kathy, I've always appreciated your focus on the vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2162.818s">Having</a>  Noah inside the program for some of our years together has been helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2170.322s">And</a>  I did not go through a vocational program, so having you to keep bringing it up is really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2177.626s">And</a>  your perspectives on that has <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2181.027s">definitely</a>  helped a lot in many of our decisions, so thank you so much for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2186.97s">And</a>  last but not least, I found it amusing the superintendent used the word direct to describe Member Mustone, but I like the word blunt because it's less refined, and not that you're less refined, but you were the one I was hardest to write some words for because <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2205.177s">As</a>  some of you may know, Mia got me elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2209.498s">Lots</a>  of other people did too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2211.139s">But</a>  as soon as I announced, or maybe you announced, I don't remember who announced me, she dragged me around to this every corner of this city, because she knew everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2222.883s">And</a>  when I say everyone, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2225.006s">literally</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2228.029s">And</a>  so, but it was fun because she wasn't, you know, she wasn't dragging around and just like leaving me in a corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2234.234s">She</a>  was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2235.763s">stick</a>  me in the face of every person that I might need to know or want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2241.728s">So</a>  I can never say thank you enough for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2245.572s">But</a>  in all of that, also, I gained a lifelong friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2249.175s">And</a>  it will be difficult to not have you to look across and be like, oh my god, this meeting is still going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2262.845s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2266.866s">And</a>  I think that's all I'm going to say now, but I'll say more later at dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2272.888s">So</a>  thank you for being my conscience sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2278.269s">I</a>  did also want to say that like, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2281.485s">Me</a>  and I would come at many issues from incredibly different perspectives and I loved that we most of the time at least arrived at exactly the same conclusions or views on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2293.454s">And</a>  that was quite a learning experience to know that like people don't have to come at things from the same place to come to the same conclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2302.54s">which</a>  is sort of an important thing for a politician to know, but to know it and understand it and experience it is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2309.186s">So</a>  I greatly appreciated our many conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2312.428s">And</a>  no, we didn't always agree on everything, but I will miss you greatly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2317.712s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2319.093s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2320.495s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2322.076s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2324.077s">Member</a>  Kreatz or Kathy, I feel like we probably would have never known each other outside of school committee because our kids are very different ages and you live on the opposite side of town from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2336.344s">And</a>  so our paths just like naturally wouldn't have crossed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2338.465s">But</a>  I did get to know Kathy, particularly when we were going through the process of weighing the options for our next superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2345.669s">And</a>  Kathy and I had a lot of conversations about <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2348.168s">Like</a>  what does Medford need and who are the candidates and who are the right candidates and I remember that we had one of those conversations, which was supposed to be quite short at snappy patties. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2358.52s">And</a>  we had a we had a great conversation, it took a very long time and next time we go to snappy patties together we're going to have to insist that pat join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2367.929s">in</a>  the conversation because he was like, oh, no, no, this is, you know, Kathy's working on business right now and I can't possibly join you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2375.833s">And</a>  so poor Pat sat there by himself for like two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2380.196s">So</a>  next time we'll have to like bring him into the fold when we go to Snappy Patty's. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2386.239s">And</a>  I promise we will not forget about the vocational school while you're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2391.121s">And</a>  I think we actually have lots of, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2393.303s">super</a>  interesting opportunities when we talk about MSBA and I know we'll talk about that later tonight to really think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2399.878s">vocational</a>  education and what it needs and what the possibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2403.641s">So</a>  I'm super excited for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2405.602s">And</a>  we will not forget them, I promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2411.186s">Member</a>  Hays, again, like our kids are closer in age, but a little bit different age. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2416.83s">They</a>  went to different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2418.031s">So</a>  I really enjoyed campaigning with you and winning with you two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2423.495s">That</a>  was certainly, it's always nice to win, but it's nice to win with friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2427.458s">So</a>  that's super great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2430.071s">And</a>  I actually found some of my notes from a really early conversation that Sharon and I had from even before we took office about some of the goals we had for a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2440.216s">And</a>  we actually accomplished so many of them in two short years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2444.217s">It</a>  was actually sort of nice to like take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2446.498s">I</a>  was like, oh, I need to save this for later when I'm feeling like we haven't, you know, when you always feel like you haven't done enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2452.201s">It</a>  was nice to see just how many things we actually had completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2455.102s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2457.6s">And</a>  Mia, I wanted to sort of thank you for leading the way on constituent services, because I don't feel like that was a real priority of most of the committees before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2471.553s">And</a>  in a district that has its warts and is imperfect at times, like that is such a critical role that we play. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2480.339s">It</a>  doesn't happen in these meetings and it doesn't happen on the floor, but you spend countless hours with people talking about what their concerns are, how they can address them, providing guidance in terms of how parents can advocate for their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2494.726s">So</a>  thank you for leading the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2497.808s">It's</a>  become a huge part of what the community expects the school committee members to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2502.53s">And</a>  I think that until we have a perfect school system, that's really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2508.113s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2510.195s">And</a>  I think the other thing that you started, being the trendsetter that you are, was really both you and Kathy being school committee members that are also active parents with children enrolled in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2523.464s">And</a>  I think that is so important in terms of really understanding what the community is looking for, and from this seat, being able to represent <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2534.119s">not</a>  just what like your kids are going through, but what your, what your kids' friends are going through, um, sort of makes you a better school committee member in so many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2541.521s">So</a>  thank you for, um, pushing us all forward in that manner as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2546.962s">You</a>  will all be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2549.762s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2595.816s">Oop,</a>  there we go, 146 Pine Ridge Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2599.877s">I've</a>  not been on this side of the rail too often. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2602.797s">But</a>  this all seems vaguely familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2606.038s">So</a>  before I go on with the MEF, I first wanna assure you that there is life after school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2612.279s">And</a>  this is the very first school committee meeting that I've attended after two years, because I've been so busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2619.84s">But</a>  it's a pleasure to see both the mayor, the superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2625.641s">once</a>  fellow school committee members and school committee elect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2628.942s">Congratulations</a>  to you, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2631.442s">Now,</a>  I did serve with two of you for six years, and Sharon, I didn't get to serve with you, but it was a great comfort when I left knowing that you were going to take the seat because I knew you had diligently prepared by coming to so many school committee meetings that you knew your stuff and you could step right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2651.626s">So</a>  while I didn't get to serve with you, I'm certainly grateful to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2655.933s">To</a>  Kathy, Kathy, oh my God, so much time spent together. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2659.558s">And,</a>  you know, a couple of words kept on coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2663.603s">One,</a>  diligent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2665.618s">Oh</a>  my God, Kathy was the most careful about preparing for every meeting, making sure she had read and understood everything and had thought thoroughly through. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2676.162s">Just</a>  amazing dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2678.462s">And</a>  of course, one of the things that really stands out to me is being able to meet your husband and of course your incredible son Noah, who became a friend and who we enjoyed seeing all the time and who I still see his <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2691.926s">posts</a>  and whatever, and he's, of course, continuing doing wonderful volunteer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2696.128s">So</a>  hello to Noah. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2698.15s">I'm</a>  sure the time now has come where you'll really get to relax and you worked so hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2704.293s">You</a>  really deserve it, Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2705.754s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2708.155s">And</a>  to Mia, when I thought about you, there's one word that stands out for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2715.499s">Not</a>  blunt, but moral. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2720.911s">I</a>  remember in those first two years when we serve together, which there was some really difficult times, because, yeah, there were some difficult times in the other, you know, pandemic and everything, but there were some really difficult times, and you led. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2735.276s">with</a>  a deep moral sense that I just really think was wonderful, because there was a lot of pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2745.106s">And</a>  I so appreciated that from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2748.289s">And</a>  of course, with you, it's been a delight to meet all your family members, your husband Tim, to watch the kids grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2754.995s">And</a>  that's one of the things that as we, you know, sometimes forget there's a real, when we're working together every week and over the years, you get to know everybody's family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2764.36s">So</a>  anyway, congratulations to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2766.601s">I</a>  know this has been a long time coming and I know you're going to enjoy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2770.743s">And</a>  just in case you get bored now, you and I have already talked about it, but Kathy, you know, and Sharon, the Medford Educational Foundation is looking for more members and, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2782.248s">So</a>  I'd like right now to invite you to join us because we have this fantastic little group of dedicated people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2789.354s">Some</a>  of them are not here tonight, some of them I'll introduce. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2792.357s">But</a>  we've been working sort of behind the scenes for roughly seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2796.661s">I</a>  actually have to go back and figure it out sometime. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2800.905s">The</a>  Medford Educational Foundation was started <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2804.835s">way</a>  long ago, maybe 20 plus 25 years, by the late, great Bob Gilligan, attorney Bob Gilligan, and Gene Bralt, or Len Bralt, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2818.442s">It</a>  lasted for a couple of years, and then it kind of went by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2823.905s">Ann</a>  Kasuth and I resurrected it about seven or eight years ago, and we've been working behind the scenes ever since that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2835.765s">Today,</a>  tonight, on behalf of the Medford Educational Foundation, I am writing you to formally ask you to accept a donation to the Medford Public Schools to cover the specific grants that we are able to fund at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2851.755s">Each</a>  year, we have two times during the year where we accept applications from teachers, and we ask them either to apply for a grant of zero to $200 <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2865.385s">or</a>  another grant from $200 to $2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2869.231s">And</a>  we accept those grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2872.055s">And</a>  then as a body, we deliberate on the grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2876.222s">We</a>  check out with the schools that <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2879.136s">The</a>  projects are consistent with the educational values and direction that the school system must go in or is going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2888.16s">And</a>  Diane Caldwell, who of course you guys all know, has been extremely helpful in being a partner with us and volunteering her time so that we could make these grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2902.441s">This</a>  December, we received over 38 requests from teachers who outlined specific projects or requests that they believe would enhance their students' learning experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2917.219s">While</a>  we would have loved to fund each and every one of them, we met as a group and decided which grants we could fund in their entirety, which grants we could partially fund, and sadly, which grants we couldn't afford at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2931.087s">The</a>  December application cycle yielded more than $24,000 in requests, and we have been able to fund $13,058.86. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2947.307s">So</a>  tonight, we're asking you to approve our donation, and I do want to mention that we've done this before but we haven't been asked to present it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2956.137s">But</a>  we also gave over $10,000 in the spring for example too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2961.483s">However,</a>  we would not be able to do the work we do with the support of our donors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2967.409s">we</a>  want to acknowledge the generosity of Needham Bank, and especially Vice President and Branch Manager, Jean Kalau, who presented us with a total donation of over $10,000 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2980.275s">And...</a>  This is Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2981.256s">Jean,</a>  stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2985.218s">Jean.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2995.492s">This</a>  connection between us and Jean was because of Mia. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3001.219s">And</a>  so we are extremely appreciative for that because it sure has helped this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3006.586s">As</a>  you can see, our requests are steadily increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3010.29s">And</a>  in fact, it's, you know, we need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3012.653s">We</a>  need more money, Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3016.212s">So,</a>  and let's see, I wrote, the Medford Education Foundation has kept a low profile, but has been receiving, reviewing, and funding grants to teachers over the last seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3030.543s">This</a>  coming year, we hope to share our good news more widely as we anticipate the need to raise more funds for the many requests we find ourselves receiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3040.53s">That</a>  is code for don't be surprised if you get a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3045.812s">Anyway,</a>  I'd just like to take a second to acknowledge the rest of the members I have with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3053.875s">David</a>  Sayers, David <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3056.138s">coordinates</a>  all the grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3057.919s">In</a>  the second row, Stephen Hayes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3060.101s">Stephen</a>  Hayes makes sure that all the money is aligned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3063.484s">And</a>  by the way, we have been working with Gerry McCue and Noel Velez right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3070.889s">And</a>  I wish I had one of those big checks, but we know better to waste money on this, on necessities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3078.135s">So</a>  here's the check and they're not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3080.757s">So</a>  I guess superintendent, I'm going to give it to you.</p>
