    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1770.169s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1770.43s">Can</a>  you please come forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1803.698s">Last</a>  but definitely not least, Mia Mastone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1809.701s">As</a>  an eight-year member of the Medford School Committee, member Mia Mastone has made a deep mark on our school community as a true servant leader and an advocate for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1823.127s">recognizing</a>  that every child is unique and that we must seize every opportunity to improve students' success and well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1833.689s">Member</a>  Mustone is always realistic, grounded, and focused, making sure that we never miss the chance to attain improvements and success in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1846.972s">Throughout</a>  her tenure, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1848.892s">Mia</a>  always kept track of the pulse of the community across grade levels and disciplines, particularly as a constant and active champion for our fine and performing arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1861.683s">As</a>  a parent and school committee member, Mia is deeply involved in and committed to student life. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1869.97s">In</a>  addition to her commitment to Medford students, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1873.513s">Mia</a>  always prioritized making Medford Public Schools a great place to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1879.977s">Her</a>  fair-minded approach and commitment to all staff, from classroom teachers to paraprofessionals and cafeteria staff, have helped make our schools stronger and better. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1891.468s">Mia</a>  is a leader notable for her humility and thoughtfulness, sometimes the least likely to speak up in a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1899.593s">All</a>  who know her share the confidence that anything she does, have to say, will be concise, direct, clear, and respectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1909.56s">I</a>  know I speak for all our school leaders when I thank member Mastone for always trusting and empowering our administrators and educators to do their jobs and to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1921.768s">On</a>  a personal level, I share a great deal with Mia. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1925.531s">We</a>  have a common high school alma mater, and Mia graduated with my sister. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1931.054s">So</a>  we come from similar landscapes of experience and perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1935.586s">I</a>  have always admired Mia's deep conviction and her personal faith, which have clearly guided her work and service as a member of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1946.935s">Thank</a>  you, Mia, for your dedication and service to the students, employees, and educators of the Medford Public Schools.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1967.025s">Member</a>  Bestone, thank you so much for your service the last eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1971.087s">Again,</a>  like you said to Member Kreatz and Member Hays, tough two years and then extremely tough two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1979.351s">They're</a>  all tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1980.592s">They're</a>  all tough, but it's a grind and you do it because, not because of the emails we get every day or the phone calls, but you do it because you're trying to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1991.377s">You</a>  fought, since I've seen you every, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=1994.788s">other</a>  Monday night fought for equality and fairness and making sure that our students got what they need and make sure there was better pay for after school workers and paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2005.093s">And</a>  you've really led the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2006.454s">I</a>  admire your hard work and dedication to the city, the school and the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2012.016s">And</a>  you all know you have our numbers and we're going to keep fighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2014.938s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2035.475s">Take</a>  a group picture.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2100.416s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2102.036s">I</a>  was going to say much of what the superintendent already said. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2107.139s">But</a>  I just want to thank each of my colleagues one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2111.08s">Member</a>  Hays has brought an understanding about literacy that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2117.063s">As</a>  a parent and school committee member, I could not have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2120.026s">And</a>  I think that that guidance around coaching and helping our teaching staff have what they needed was really important for us as we battled in the last budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2130.635s">So</a>  I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2132.997s">I'm</a>  a little surprised it was only 31 months ago when we sat down at Tasty. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2137.561s">No,</a>  it wasn't Tasty. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2138.723s">Where's</a>  the cafe? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2140.524s">classic</a>  cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2142.626s">And</a>  that seems like just yesterday, but nothing else on school committee does. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2149.293s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2153.834s">but</a>  I hate saying member-crats, it feels fairly personal here, but Kathy, I've always appreciated your focus on the vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2162.818s">Having</a>  Noah inside the program for some of our years together has been helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2170.322s">And</a>  I did not go through a vocational program, so having you to keep bringing it up is really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2177.626s">And</a>  your perspectives on that has <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2181.027s">definitely</a>  helped a lot in many of our decisions, so thank you so much for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2186.97s">And</a>  last but not least, I found it amusing the superintendent used the word direct to describe Member Mustone, but I like the word blunt because it's less refined, and not that you're less refined, but you were the one I was hardest to write some words for because <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2205.177s">As</a>  some of you may know, Mia got me elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2209.498s">Lots</a>  of other people did too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2211.139s">But</a>  as soon as I announced, or maybe you announced, I don't remember who announced me, she dragged me around to this every corner of this city, because she knew everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2222.883s">And</a>  when I say everyone, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2225.006s">literally</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2228.029s">And</a>  so, but it was fun because she wasn't, you know, she wasn't dragging around and just like leaving me in a corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2234.234s">She</a>  was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2235.763s">stick</a>  me in the face of every person that I might need to know or want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2241.728s">So</a>  I can never say thank you enough for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2245.572s">But</a>  in all of that, also, I gained a lifelong friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2249.175s">And</a>  it will be difficult to not have you to look across and be like, oh my god, this meeting is still going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2262.845s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2266.866s">And</a>  I think that's all I'm going to say now, but I'll say more later at dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2272.888s">So</a>  thank you for being my conscience sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2278.269s">I</a>  did also want to say that like, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2281.485s">Me</a>  and I would come at many issues from incredibly different perspectives and I loved that we most of the time at least arrived at exactly the same conclusions or views on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2293.454s">And</a>  that was quite a learning experience to know that like people don't have to come at things from the same place to come to the same conclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2302.54s">which</a>  is sort of an important thing for a politician to know, but to know it and understand it and experience it is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2309.186s">So</a>  I greatly appreciated our many conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2312.428s">And</a>  no, we didn't always agree on everything, but I will miss you greatly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2317.712s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2319.093s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2320.495s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2322.076s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2324.077s">Member</a>  Kreatz or Kathy, I feel like we probably would have never known each other outside of school committee because our kids are very different ages and you live on the opposite side of town from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2336.344s">And</a>  so our paths just like naturally wouldn't have crossed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2338.465s">But</a>  I did get to know Kathy, particularly when we were going through the process of weighing the options for our next superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2345.669s">And</a>  Kathy and I had a lot of conversations about <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2348.168s">Like</a>  what does Medford need and who are the candidates and who are the right candidates and I remember that we had one of those conversations, which was supposed to be quite short at snappy patties. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2358.52s">And</a>  we had a we had a great conversation, it took a very long time and next time we go to snappy patties together we're going to have to insist that pat join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2367.929s">in</a>  the conversation because he was like, oh, no, no, this is, you know, Kathy's working on business right now and I can't possibly join you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2375.833s">And</a>  so poor Pat sat there by himself for like two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2380.196s">So</a>  next time we'll have to like bring him into the fold when we go to Snappy Patty's. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2386.239s">And</a>  I promise we will not forget about the vocational school while you're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2391.121s">And</a>  I think we actually have lots of, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2393.303s">super</a>  interesting opportunities when we talk about MSBA and I know we'll talk about that later tonight to really think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2399.878s">vocational</a>  education and what it needs and what the possibilities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2403.641s">So</a>  I'm super excited for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2405.602s">And</a>  we will not forget them, I promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2411.186s">Member</a>  Hays, again, like our kids are closer in age, but a little bit different age. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2416.83s">They</a>  went to different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2418.031s">So</a>  I really enjoyed campaigning with you and winning with you two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2423.495s">That</a>  was certainly, it's always nice to win, but it's nice to win with friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2427.458s">So</a>  that's super great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2430.071s">And</a>  I actually found some of my notes from a really early conversation that Sharon and I had from even before we took office about some of the goals we had for a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2440.216s">And</a>  we actually accomplished so many of them in two short years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2444.217s">It</a>  was actually sort of nice to like take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2446.498s">I</a>  was like, oh, I need to save this for later when I'm feeling like we haven't, you know, when you always feel like you haven't done enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2452.201s">It</a>  was nice to see just how many things we actually had completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2455.102s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2457.6s">And</a>  Mia, I wanted to sort of thank you for leading the way on constituent services, because I don't feel like that was a real priority of most of the committees before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2471.553s">And</a>  in a district that has its warts and is imperfect at times, like that is such a critical role that we play. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2480.339s">It</a>  doesn't happen in these meetings and it doesn't happen on the floor, but you spend countless hours with people talking about what their concerns are, how they can address them, providing guidance in terms of how parents can advocate for their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2494.726s">So</a>  thank you for leading the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2497.808s">It's</a>  become a huge part of what the community expects the school committee members to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2502.53s">And</a>  I think that until we have a perfect school system, that's really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2508.113s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2510.195s">And</a>  I think the other thing that you started, being the trendsetter that you are, was really both you and Kathy being school committee members that are also active parents with children enrolled in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2523.464s">And</a>  I think that is so important in terms of really understanding what the community is looking for, and from this seat, being able to represent <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2534.119s">not</a>  just what like your kids are going through, but what your, what your kids' friends are going through, um, sort of makes you a better school committee member in so many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2541.521s">So</a>  thank you for, um, pushing us all forward in that manner as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2546.962s">You</a>  will all be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2549.762s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2595.816s">Oop,</a>  there we go, 146 Pine Ridge Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2599.877s">I've</a>  not been on this side of the rail too often. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2602.797s">But</a>  this all seems vaguely familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2606.038s">So</a>  before I go on with the MEF, I first wanna assure you that there is life after school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2612.279s">And</a>  this is the very first school committee meeting that I've attended after two years, because I've been so busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2619.84s">But</a>  it's a pleasure to see both the mayor, the superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2625.641s">once</a>  fellow school committee members and school committee elect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2628.942s">Congratulations</a>  to you, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2631.442s">Now,</a>  I did serve with two of you for six years, and Sharon, I didn't get to serve with you, but it was a great comfort when I left knowing that you were going to take the seat because I knew you had diligently prepared by coming to so many school committee meetings that you knew your stuff and you could step right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2651.626s">So</a>  while I didn't get to serve with you, I'm certainly grateful to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2655.933s">To</a>  Kathy, Kathy, oh my God, so much time spent together. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2659.558s">And,</a>  you know, a couple of words kept on coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2663.603s">One,</a>  diligent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2665.618s">Oh</a>  my God, Kathy was the most careful about preparing for every meeting, making sure she had read and understood everything and had thought thoroughly through. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2676.162s">Just</a>  amazing dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2678.462s">And</a>  of course, one of the things that really stands out to me is being able to meet your husband and of course your incredible son Noah, who became a friend and who we enjoyed seeing all the time and who I still see his <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2691.926s">posts</a>  and whatever, and he's, of course, continuing doing wonderful volunteer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2696.128s">So</a>  hello to Noah. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2698.15s">I'm</a>  sure the time now has come where you'll really get to relax and you worked so hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2704.293s">You</a>  really deserve it, Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2705.754s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2708.155s">And</a>  to Mia, when I thought about you, there's one word that stands out for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2715.499s">Not</a>  blunt, but moral. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2720.911s">I</a>  remember in those first two years when we serve together, which there was some really difficult times, because, yeah, there were some difficult times in the other, you know, pandemic and everything, but there were some really difficult times, and you led. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2735.276s">with</a>  a deep moral sense that I just really think was wonderful, because there was a lot of pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2745.106s">And</a>  I so appreciated that from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2748.289s">And</a>  of course, with you, it's been a delight to meet all your family members, your husband Tim, to watch the kids grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2754.995s">And</a>  that's one of the things that as we, you know, sometimes forget there's a real, when we're working together every week and over the years, you get to know everybody's family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2764.36s">So</a>  anyway, congratulations to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2766.601s">I</a>  know this has been a long time coming and I know you're going to enjoy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2770.743s">And</a>  just in case you get bored now, you and I have already talked about it, but Kathy, you know, and Sharon, the Medford Educational Foundation is looking for more members and, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2782.248s">So</a>  I'd like right now to invite you to join us because we have this fantastic little group of dedicated people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2789.354s">Some</a>  of them are not here tonight, some of them I'll introduce. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2792.357s">But</a>  we've been working sort of behind the scenes for roughly seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2796.661s">I</a>  actually have to go back and figure it out sometime. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2800.905s">The</a>  Medford Educational Foundation was started <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2804.835s">way</a>  long ago, maybe 20 plus 25 years, by the late, great Bob Gilligan, attorney Bob Gilligan, and Gene Bralt, or Len Bralt, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2818.442s">It</a>  lasted for a couple of years, and then it kind of went by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2823.905s">Ann</a>  Kasuth and I resurrected it about seven or eight years ago, and we've been working behind the scenes ever since that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2835.765s">Today,</a>  tonight, on behalf of the Medford Educational Foundation, I am writing you to formally ask you to accept a donation to the Medford Public Schools to cover the specific grants that we are able to fund at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2851.755s">Each</a>  year, we have two times during the year where we accept applications from teachers, and we ask them either to apply for a grant of zero to $200 <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2865.385s">or</a>  another grant from $200 to $2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2869.231s">And</a>  we accept those grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2872.055s">And</a>  then as a body, we deliberate on the grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2876.222s">We</a>  check out with the schools that <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2879.136s">The</a>  projects are consistent with the educational values and direction that the school system must go in or is going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2888.16s">And</a>  Diane Caldwell, who of course you guys all know, has been extremely helpful in being a partner with us and volunteering her time so that we could make these grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2902.441s">This</a>  December, we received over 38 requests from teachers who outlined specific projects or requests that they believe would enhance their students' learning experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2917.219s">While</a>  we would have loved to fund each and every one of them, we met as a group and decided which grants we could fund in their entirety, which grants we could partially fund, and sadly, which grants we couldn't afford at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2931.087s">The</a>  December application cycle yielded more than $24,000 in requests, and we have been able to fund $13,058.86. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2947.307s">So</a>  tonight, we're asking you to approve our donation, and I do want to mention that we've done this before but we haven't been asked to present it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2956.137s">But</a>  we also gave over $10,000 in the spring for example too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2961.483s">However,</a>  we would not be able to do the work we do with the support of our donors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2967.409s">we</a>  want to acknowledge the generosity of Needham Bank, and especially Vice President and Branch Manager, Jean Kalau, who presented us with a total donation of over $10,000 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2980.275s">And...</a>  This is Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2981.256s">Jean,</a>  stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2985.218s">Jean.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2995.492s">This</a>  connection between us and Jean was because of Mia. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3001.219s">And</a>  so we are extremely appreciative for that because it sure has helped this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3006.586s">As</a>  you can see, our requests are steadily increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3010.29s">And</a>  in fact, it's, you know, we need more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3012.653s">We</a>  need more money, Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3016.212s">So,</a>  and let's see, I wrote, the Medford Education Foundation has kept a low profile, but has been receiving, reviewing, and funding grants to teachers over the last seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3030.543s">This</a>  coming year, we hope to share our good news more widely as we anticipate the need to raise more funds for the many requests we find ourselves receiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3040.53s">That</a>  is code for don't be surprised if you get a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3045.812s">Anyway,</a>  I'd just like to take a second to acknowledge the rest of the members I have with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3053.875s">David</a>  Sayers, David <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3056.138s">coordinates</a>  all the grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3057.919s">In</a>  the second row, Stephen Hayes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3060.101s">Stephen</a>  Hayes makes sure that all the money is aligned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3063.484s">And</a>  by the way, we have been working with Gerry McCue and Noel Velez right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3070.889s">And</a>  I wish I had one of those big checks, but we know better to waste money on this, on necessities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3078.135s">So</a>  here's the check and they're not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3080.757s">So</a>  I guess superintendent, I'm going to give it to you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3084.451s">So</a>  is there a motion for approval for acceptance?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3097.676s">So</a>  now I can officially hand it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3101.778s">Steve</a>  should really be up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3114.335s">So</a>  our treasurer, Steve, is very diligent and tracking all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3120.701s">And,</a>  you know, we hope after we closed our time period for receiving the grants, we received several more on top of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3130.871s">And</a>  the other place where we've had donations, apart from private donations, which we also <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3136.013s">solicit</a>  and accept happily. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3138.974s">The</a>  Medford Community Fund has also been generous to us, and I want to acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3144.196s">So</a>  again, it's great to see you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3146.157s">Have</a>  a great night, and thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Chad Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3545.922s">I</a>  think one of the best parts about bringing anything but a backpack was the young man who carried a kayak on his shoulder throughout the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3554.205s">That</a>  was pretty cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3557.107s">Before</a>  I give an update on career tech education, I just wanted to offer a shout out to our new principal of the high school who's done an amazing job so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3566.39s">Keep</a>  it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3567.371s">We</a>  are, our colleague of ours just, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3573.757s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3574.538s">A</a>  colleague of ours gave a great, Sheila Freitas-Haley, an assistant principal on the administrative team, said, we're at Framingham right now, when you think about the marathon. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3586.428s">So</a>  we're halfway there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3587.99s">And</a>  it's good to keep the momentum going. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3590.312s">So,</a>  so far, so good. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3591.773s">I</a>  know I enjoy working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3594.006s">I</a>  wanna give a few updates for career tech education. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3596.907s">The</a>  first that I have up is a picture of a community project that we took on and the letter basically states, it's a family in the community that had a family member who was unfortunately bedridden and there was access issues going in and out of the home. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3612.294s">So</a>  when two teachers came to me and asked for my permission, I gave it our blessing right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3617.437s">We</a>  were able to use a lot of the stock that we had in the carpentry shop <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3620.854s">And</a>  it was a collaboration between our carpentry students, our construction students, and our metal fabrication students who built a metal ramp off the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3629.219s">This</a>  really was work that makes everyone feel good. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3632.48s">The</a>  students definitely enjoyed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3634.221s">The</a>  teachers enjoyed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3635.362s">And</a>  we know that we were able to help someone in the community get in and out of their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3639.628s">So</a>  that's one project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3641.57s">The</a>  next slide is an update on we have done completed for sheds. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3646.975s">So</a>  if you're looking for the finest built shed this side of the Mississippi, look no further. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3653.442s">We</a>  have started this last year so we're on our fourth shed right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3659.141s">This</a>  is the launch to really be able being able to do more building projects in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3665.307s">So</a>  even prior to this we had done a few pantries for people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3669.592s">But</a>  what this is allowing students to do is use the tools that we purchased through grants load up the trailers and trucks and head out to a job site. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3677.64s">The</a>  construction craft labor students were able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3680.883s">lay</a>  the cement padding for the shed which if you've done a shed you know that that really is key it's better to have it on that than you know crushed stone or dirt so these certainly will last a long time and the carpentry students complete the build a lot of it in the shop and then we'll transport it to the job site and this was a collaborative effort between both of them so we're very proud that we just completed our fourth and as you can see from the pictures these are beautiful sheds so now that we kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3708.14s">have</a>  a year under our belt. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3709.541s">We'll</a>  be opening it up more to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3711.282s">We</a>  think we can take on a few more next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3713.222s">We've</a>  already worked with Dr. Cushing for a request for some of the elementary schools that need some storage sheds. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3718.045s">We'll</a>  be taking that on in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3724.448s">The</a>  last update is something that we participate in every year, and it's something, it's really a wonderful event that's held at the electricians union in Dorchester, and it's a women in trades conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3737.546s">And</a>  I thought it was fitting to have the picture in the upper left. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3739.848s">That's</a>  one of our students in carpentry, who is a female student in a predominantly male trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3745.451s">So</a>  I thought, what better picture to throw up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3747.753s">By</a>  the way, they have so much fun at the job site. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3749.874s">It's</a>  really comical when the teacher sends me the pictures at the end of the day, because no one is not smiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3755.638s">It's</a>  been, you know, the weather is unpredictable and they still have a great time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3759.46s">So</a>  the Women in Trade Conference was led, many different vendors were there from many different unions in the state, in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3767.606s">And</a>  just providing that encouragement for all people to know that there really is no barrier when it comes to the career you choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3775.573s">And</a>  this one in particular was for our female students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3779.537s">I</a>  think that would be the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3783.821s">Just</a>  an update on some of our cooperative education employers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3786.744s">Right</a>  now we have <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3788.143s">just</a>  about half of the senior class out on cooperative education. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3791.504s">And</a>  just a reminder, co-op is always a paid position. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3794.344s">We</a>  don't put anyone out on unpaid positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3797.005s">Some</a>  of the newest partners we secured is Spalding Hospital, Mass General and Volkswagen at Watertown. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3803.267s">So</a>  for our students, they're not going out to, you know, little jobs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3809.328s">They're</a>  going out to some of the major hospitals in the area and some <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3814.508s">some</a>  great opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3815.749s">We</a>  even have a student who's doing, she's in health assisting, but she wants to pursue dentistry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3819.952s">So</a>  she's working at a dental office being a dental assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3823.635s">So</a>  co-op is definitely a hallmark of the program for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3828.179s">And</a>  that is an update from CTE and Medford High School.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3840.568s">Questions</a>  or are we?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3843.273s">No,</a>  thank you so much for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3844.734s">We</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3850.26s">We</a>  have an exciting update from our superintendent of schools regarding Medford High School's invitation to the MSBA eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3860.07s">Dr.</a>  Edouard-Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3862.509s">Yes,</a>  I'm so excited to share this news. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3866.45s">Last</a>  week, after years of applying for the program, Medford High School was invited into phase one of the Massachusetts School Building Authority's core program, which provides substantial reimbursement as high as 60% of all project costs for the renovation or rebuilding of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3892.18s">We</a>  are grateful to Massachusetts Treasurer Deb Goldberg, the MSBA Board of Directors, and our state legislators, Senator Pat Jalen, and Representatives Christine Barber, Paul Donato, and Sean Garbally, for their commitment to city-state partnership on this important priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3917.043s">Thank</a>  you also to the countless Medford High School, MHS and district staff, educators who worked hard on our statement of interest to the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3930.906s">We</a>  also extend a special thanks to the school committee and the city of Medford for your continued support with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3939.988s">On</a>  Thursday, Medford participated in the first orientation session with MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3948.086s">We're</a>  beginning to learn about the timeline, criteria, and process for phase one of the core program, and we're ready to hit the ground running in 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3959.514s">We're</a>  only at the very beginning of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3964.398s">which</a>  will truly kick into gear next spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3967.941s">But</a>  for now, we are excited and pleased to celebrate this milestone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3973.766s">In</a>  the new year, we'll begin to discuss in greater detail the timeline, priorities, and other steps to advance this great opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3992.554s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3993.778s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3994.782s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3995.705s">I</a>  attended the orientation on Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3998.359s">just</a>  feels like three weeks ago at this point, but it was very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4002.54s">It</a>  was 70 people on the Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4005.601s">So</a>  it was kind of an interesting way to orient because every single person there surely had two hours worth of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4014.383s">So</a>  I look forward to future smaller scale orientations where we can actually ask our questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4020.084s">Cause</a>  that was a little overwhelming that there were 19 communities invited in <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4024.96s">which</a>  apparently is more than normal, quite a bit more than normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4028.562s">So</a>  I also think we should thank tax revenues that allowed them to have a bigger budget this year, because that's just an unprecedented number. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4039.708s">In</a>  the presentation they gave us, they said there were $2 billion worth of projects in this 19 schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4046.751s">I</a>  think it was 2 billion, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4049.048s">One</a>  or two, I thought it was two, but maybe it was only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4051.53s">One</a>  billion, two billion, big numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4054.152s">I</a>  don't know that we can get that many schools for one billion, but so it's very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4061.078s">And</a>  I look forward to this very stringent process that we must go through and deadlines we must meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4067.164s">And</a>  I'm hopeful we can beat the deadlines because most of the deadlines are things that are like, there's like a deadline, but if we can get it done early, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4075.82s">can</a>  be early and I like early. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4077.842s">So</a>  I'm very excited to take the five to seven year project and make it four to five maybe.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4084.747s">That</a>  would be nice.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4085.588s">Thank</a>  you member Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4086.769s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4088.35s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4090.272s">Same.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4090.792s">I'm</a>  looking forward to moving as quickly as possible and we were at the school committee conference back in November before MSBA had <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4099.451s">made</a>  their final decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4101.092s">And</a>  I asked that question of them, which is how do we, what advice do you have for communities who are ready to move? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4108.477s">Like</a>  we are, you know, long past the time where we should have been starting this through a whole variety of unfortunate events, but here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4118.024s">So</a>  what I can say is that there's just a lot of work ahead, but that <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4123.43s">this</a>  first step is critical because now we get to move as quick as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4128.351s">So</a>  until now we sort of haven't been able to do that unless we were as a community sort of flush with hundreds of millions of dollars to build a school on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4139.215s">And</a>  that hasn't gone great for other communities who have gone down that path. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4142.836s">So</a>  the eligibility period though is pretty pivotal from a scoping perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4148.097s">So</a>  there's a lot of things that have to happen in the next <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4151.318s">x</a>  months. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4151.959s">We</a>  have 270 days to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4155.463s">But</a>  there are some really important questions that we'll talk about as a district and as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4161.923s">including</a>  things like what are our enrollment projections? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4164.444s">What</a>  kind of vocational programs do we wanna have? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4167.104s">What</a>  is our capacity right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4168.864s">What</a>  do we want our capacity to be in those programs in this new building? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4173.045s">And</a>  basically sort of all the things that go into deciding what size space is going to go out to the bidders to say, now we need you to tell us what is feasible, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4184.608s">But</a>  the other sort of things that are, I think we're lucky enough to have incorporated in our bid are things like, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4191.547s">What</a>  about our pre-K programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4193.229s">So</a>  we have just a huge strategic opportunity because we have pre-K programs in that building today. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4198.995s">And</a>  our invitation included the acknowledgement that we had programs like the MFN in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4207.202s">And</a>  we have several preschool programs with Kids Corner and then with the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4213.364s">We</a>  also have an opportunity to talk about how to best serve our students at Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4218.566s">Transporting</a>  them across the city for some of the opportunities that they might want to take advantage of is a huge challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4224.528s">So</a>  we'll be talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4226.83s">And</a>  then we will also in this eligibility phase be talking about how do we maintain our spaces and what are our plans and how can we promise and demonstrate to the MSBA that we'll be good stewards of the state's money when this building comes to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4243.145s">And</a>  then also in this phase, we will form a building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4246.989s">That's</a>  one of the requirements of the phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4249.266s">And</a>  that's where we will look. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4250.968s">There's</a>  a lot of requirements to meet even in forming a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4254.151s">So</a>  there's a really like specific set of individuals that have to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4258.916s">But</a>  this is our opportunity to say how do we want to do this together in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4262.9s">So</a>  all of that is coming in the eligibility phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4266.519s">And</a>  I think a lot of people have asked a lot of questions about like, is it a new school? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4270.322s">Is</a>  it a revised school? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4271.723s">Is</a>  it at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4272.824s">Is</a>  it on the field? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4273.724s">Is</a>  it in a different location? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4275.446s">All</a>  of those questions don't start to get asked and answered until the eligibility phase is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4280.089s">So</a>  I think this initial phase really sets up sort of the bones of the scope of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4286.574s">And</a>  then that feasibility study that happens next will actually allow us to say what is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4292.774s">Um,</a>  what do we want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4294.155s">What,</a>  what do we want to do and how could we do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4296.197s">So</a>  that feasibility study happens at the conclusion of eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4300.48s">Um,</a>  so we don't have those answers just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4303.302s">And</a>  I just want people to know it's nobody's, um, nobody's got any secret answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4307.545s">Um,</a>  they, they truly don't exist yet because we will hire, um, professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4312.349s">We</a>  will hire an owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4314.191s">We'll</a>  hire architects. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4315.371s">Those</a>  folks will help us based on this eligibility work that we're doing really thoughtfully to say, here's how you meet those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4323.121s">Here's</a>  what your choices are as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4325.762s">And</a>  then, you know, here's how you can sort of move forward into the building phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4329.483s">So</a>  we're a bit away from some of those questions, but we're going to move as fast as we can to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4334.945s">Because</a>  I think that's the, those are the real questions people are impatient to ask and answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4339.626s">And</a>  I totally get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4341.487s">My</a>  daughter will definitely not graduate from any sort of a revised school and like, fingers crossed, if we move really fast, Lucas might make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4349.898s">Um,</a>  and so I'm super sensitive to the generation of kids that has, um, not had the benefit of, um, some sort of beautiful new building and, and it's sort of incumbent on all of us to figure out how do we move as fast as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4362.448s">So</a>  there are as few of those kids as possible out there.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4365.27s">Thank</a>  you, member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4366.631s">And</a>  just from the chair, if I may, I just want to thank everybody that had anything to do with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4372.836s">I</a>  think it started for us two years ago with our last application and making sure we had a strong application. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4379.008s">all</a>  the way through to now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4380.309s">I</a>  know a number of us on the committee were on those calls this last week, and we're going to be following the process and helping them how we can with our Dr. Edouard-Vincent leading the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4390.137s">And</a>  we're going to get this done and get it hopefully done sooner than five to seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4394.0s">We're</a>  so excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4394.92s">It</a>  is beyond time for our students and faculty and staff to have a building that they deserve, that is conducive to <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4403.059s">learning</a>  in a better environment than they have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4405.281s">So</a>  we're excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4406.542s">And</a>  finally, some good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4408.824s">So</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4411.847s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4412.267s">Thank</a>  you, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4415.79s">Next</a>  up, we do not have any presentations of the public, continued business or new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4420.014s">And</a>  we do have a reports requested by member Hays and member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4424.818s">And</a>  I'm reminded

you like to speak on it or do you want a motion for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4582.981s">Just</a>  a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4588.305s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4588.665s">I</a>  know you spent hours on that and with the admin and we look forward to the presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4594.315s">February,</a>  there's a motion on the floor by Member Hays, seconded by Member Mustone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4600.999s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4602.881s">Before</a>  we do that, before rolls, ask some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4605.582s">Called</a>  Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4607.164s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4608.745s">I</a>  am generally supportive of getting a report that does many of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4614.862s">But</a>  there are some things on this list that A, are not appropriate for the administration to weigh in on because they are subject to negotiations, which are held by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4625.949s">There</a>  are others on this list that talk about the vision for MHS, which I believe will be handled in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4635.433s">when</a>  we talk about the building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4637.013s">So</a>  I would like to make a motion to sever items two, three, four, and nine from this, because I just don't think it's appropriate for this committee on its way out the door to be describing or dictating the future bargaining position of the committee that they will not be a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4655.399s">So</a>  bargaining negotiations are a whole strategy and deciding one piece of a strategy in advance of <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4664.601s">a</a>  new and entirely new committee that's gonna take a seat, I think is not appropriate at this time for this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4669.642s">So</a>  I'd like to make a motion to sever two, three, four, and nine from the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4674.583s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4679.684s">Motion</a>  to sever by member Graham, seconded by member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4683.744s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4685.285s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4686.445s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4690.146s">Please</a>  mark member Hays as opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4700.545s">And</a>  then there's a motion on the floor to approve everything that wasn't taken out or severed by member, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4709.147s">Stone,</a>  seconded by member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4710.628s">So</a>  roll call vote on everything except two, three, four, nine.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4716.469s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4717.33s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4718.43s">Member</a>  Hays?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4719.19s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4720.01s">Member</a>  Kraft?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4720.911s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4722.151s">Member</a>  Coffin-Zappa and member Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4723.431s">Stone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4724.732s">Member</a>  Ruseau, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4725.732s">Mayor</a>  Longo, correct?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4726.832s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4727.432s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4731.118s">as</a>  severed.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4732.019s">Mayor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4733.039s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4734.8s">Yes,</a>  I'm just wondering, and we can get this later, but this doesn't have an item number on this, and usually those are created when the items are submitted, so if somebody could get that to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4745.666s">I</a>  don't know if Member Hays got that when she submitted it, or if the administration has it, but like, you know, the 2023-whatever.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4755.712s">Because</a>  it was sent as a requested report, so that was why I hadn't put it as a resolution, because we were using the numbers for resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4764.48s">But</a>  we can actually start maybe a new number for requested reports.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4770.946s">I</a>  think in our rules, they just get the same number. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4773.568s">The</a>  same number? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4774.268s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4774.729s">We'll</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4775.53s">Just</a>  because the votes and the notes will need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4778.292s">Okay,</a>  we'll do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4779.253s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4784.096s">We</a>  have a number of condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4788.217s">The</a>  members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Marie Christine Perdillo, an elementary teacher for 30 years for the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4798.539s">Also,</a>  the members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Janet Valentin, mother of Donna Lasky, an elementary teacher at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4809.77s">The</a>  members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Elmer L. Counts, husband of Shirley Counts, retired principal of the Brooks Hobbs School. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4821.58s">And</a>  the members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Daniel Jendrew of Lakeville, cousin of Medford High School assistant principal, Shayla Freitas-Haley. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4833.731s">And</a>  last, the members of the Medford School Committee express its sincerest condolences <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4837.978s">to</a>  the family of Marjorie A. Sanford, who was in the Medford High School class of 1953 and was a secretary in both the Swan Elementary and Roberts Junior High School for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4848.144s">If</a>  we all may rise for a moment of silence, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4862.432s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4865.506s">We</a>  wish everybody a wonderful holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4869.528s">Our</a>  next scheduled meeting will be January 8th, 2024 in the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, and via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4877.372s">The</a>  inauguration is January 7th, which is the Sunday at 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4881.614s">Please</a>  join us here at the Alden Chambers for that, and if there's no other business, a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4889.357s">I</a>  move for press, seconded by member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=4892.599s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>
