00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:26,447
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:35,530
The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed decisions.

3
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:44,733
Today, we welcome a candidate, a good candidate for the Medford City Council, Patrick Clark, into the show.

4
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:45,793
Good evening, Patrick.

5
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:46,374
How are you?

6
00:00:47,754 --> 00:00:48,974
Thanks for having me back again, John.

7
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:50,515
It's good to be back.

8
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:52,456
Good to have you, good to have you.

9
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:55,819
We're going to get right into this, Patrick.

10
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:02,486
You know, we all know what the number one biggest issue in Method is right now.

11
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:07,830
The talk continues, it's back and forth, and I'm just going to come out.

12
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,713
What's your opinion on the zoning?

13
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:12,074
What do you feel about it?

14
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:16,058
What do you think needs to be done or what's your approach?

15
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:20,295
to this zoning issue that's it's all for the benefit.

16
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:22,037
So I'll let you take it.

17
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:26,201
Yeah, this does really seem to be the linchpin issue in the city right now.

18
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,265
And I think it's a really unfortunate that it's come to a grinding halt.

19
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:31,866
Well,

20
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:45,739
I first and foremost agree that there does need to be a comprehensive look at the city zoning, you don't just want it to be a patchwork or a Frankenstein's monster of different zoning proposals.

21
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:53,124
But I also think you have to offset that with considering the needs of the neighborhoods, and I've said that before, and I'll continue to say it.

22
00:01:53,804 --> 00:02:14,395
I think that the biggest oversight was not doing neighborhood impact studies with the neighborhoods that were going to be affected so that you would understand things like traffic flow patterns and parking situation and the utilities, what the effect was going to be on as you connect these large buildings up to the utilities and

23
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:27,125
the sound studies that affect what are the different neighborhoods going to hear from the traffic changes, and also light studies, what are the shadow effects going to be like.

24
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:43,999
And because that wasn't done in a, I would say, sophisticated way that kept people abreast of what was going on, people felt like they were just being excluded from the process or that they were being railroaded.

25
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:47,789
So here we are right now.

26
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,791
Things have come to a grinding halt.

27
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:57,278
And I think that clearly the city's budget needs this commercial revenue and this mutual revenue.

28
00:02:58,118 --> 00:03:06,185
I don't think it's a good idea to try to operate off of overrides and debt exclusions.

29
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:10,069
I think that is, as I've mentioned before, a form of financial duct tape.

30
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:20,139
But if we're to do this properly and it's to be balanced, I think one of the steps that is really going to help us move in that direction is this new charter that's on the ballot in November.

31
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:30,321
Some people might not know about it, but basically what it does is it balances the city overall, the representation with word-based representation.

32
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:43,932
Right now, we have seven at-large city council candidates, and the proposal is that we would be moving to 11 overall candidates with three of them being at-large and eight of them being word-based.

33
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:45,813
That really creates the balance.

34
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:49,536
It sets the stage for really what was missing, I feel, in this.

35
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:54,818
in this rezoning process.

36
00:03:55,058 --> 00:04:00,599
We have to really set the stage for neighborhood leadership and neighborhood participation.

37
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,781
I think that charter that's on the ballot will be a huge step in that direction.

38
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:15,863
If it is voted in, it doesn't take over immediately, but we have two years to lay the groundwork for it.

39
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:23,807
And I think if we do that, then that sets the stage for other things, like the high school is another big thing that's on people's minds right now.

40
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,669
And with the high school, it's okay.

41
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:30,770
Do we lean towards strategic renovation?

42
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,611
Do we lean towards an entirely new building?

43
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:41,406
And whatever your feelings are on that, we have to learn from the mistakes that were made in the rezoning process.

44
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:45,809
And we have to properly include the residents throughout the process.

45
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,790
And we have to say the pros and cons.

46
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,553
And we have to not lean prickly on overrides and de-exclusions to make it happen.

47
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:57,796
So all of those things tie together in one big package.

48
00:04:58,657 --> 00:04:59,877
No, they certainly do.

49
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:02,619
And it's, geez, let's see.

50
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:04,080
You hit on the charter.

51
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:19,619
You know, the zoning, you touched on the school, and I think the school is going to be a huge part of, you know, the next election cycle, so to speak.

52
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:27,505
Once whoever's going to be on the council and how the city is going to move forward with that, it's going to be interesting.

53
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:33,539
You know, that was a lot of good points you put out there.

54
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:36,762
And you basically answered all my questions, Patrick.

55
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:38,609
I mean, you know.

56
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,510
Let's get one quick tip.

57
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:42,471
Yeah, no.

58
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:46,293
But yeah, that's really.

59
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:48,535
I mean, so I will ask you this, though.

60
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:52,997
I mean, it sounds like I know I'm voting yes on the charter.

61
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:54,138
I'm not afraid.

62
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:57,900
I mean, what are you going to do with this charter as it is?

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,101
You feel it's a good thing to pass?

64
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,623
You want to comment on it?

65
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:02,803
I do.

66
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:05,659
I do feel it's a good thing to pass.

67
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:11,525
You know, a couple years ago when I first ran, I was really not familiar with the charter process that was occurring.

68
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:18,212
And I was concerned that there was going to be ideology and partisanship baked into the cake.

69
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:23,037
But after seeing what they did for the last two years, where it wasn't just

70
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,318
the public.

71
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:32,741
It wasn't just a diverse team of 11 resident voices led by Melvin McDonald, who just ran for council.

72
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:40,643
And they consulted with people who have made many different charters across the Commonwealth.

73
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,624
So I think that was an important piece of it.

74
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:48,566
But I read the entire, I don't know, 35, 37 pages or whatever it is.

75
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:50,166
And I was impressed by it.

76
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:51,307
And it wasn't just

77
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:54,423
that it was the ward based representation.

78
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:57,245
It was also that we now have a regular charter review.

79
00:06:57,845 --> 00:06:59,806
The last time we had that was 40 years ago.

80
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:10,913
We now have a budget meeting that's mandatory between the mayor and the city council and the school committee that has to happen annually earlier in the year so that the budget doesn't get kicked down the road.

81
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:13,214
So there's a bunch of things that I like about it.

82
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:17,657
And I encourage people to look at it in total rather than just some little piece of it.

83
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:19,198
I agree.

84
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:21,483
You know, that's it, Patrick.

85
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:23,364
That's all we have for you.

86
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:26,386
You know, good answers.

87
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,888
Really, you are a great candidate.

88
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:33,231
And I hope the city comes out and votes for you.

89
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:34,652
We need good people.

90
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:36,733
We need thinkers.

91
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:38,234
And we need young people.

92
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:39,895
And we need independent people.

93
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:43,317
And you're all of that in one package.

94
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:44,378
And I mean that.

95
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:47,240
So thank you for coming on the show, Patrick.

96
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:49,895

97
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:51,595
