1
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:44,376
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and so that means my audio should be going over the world.

2
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:50,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I'm unmuted and I'm switching over to that so you can see.

3
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we recording?

4
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

5
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:52,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good to go.

6
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:08,395

14
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:09,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Our agenda tonight is be it resolved that the strategic and capital planning committee will meet to review and update the district's capital needs assessment and planning document.

15
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:14,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Be it further resolved that the subcommittee will devise a process to ensure regular annual maintenance of the plan.

16
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:20,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Be it also resolved that the subcommittee will provide a report to the full school committee no later than June 10th, 2024.

17
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:22,226
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll call the roll, member Ruseau.

18
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:26,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Reinfeld.

19
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:27,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Present.

20
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:28,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And Member Graham.

21
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:28,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Present.

22
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So three presents are absent.

23
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are.

24
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,971
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have that back.

25
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:49,278
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think actually what might make sense is for us to talk about the process first in terms of like how to ensure that we are doing that we are sort of getting back, I'll say getting back to post-COVID

26
00:03:52,832 --> 00:04:10,862
[SPEAKER_01]: a more routine and I'll say rigorous process around capital planning to try to anticipate, try to have like an ongoing roadmap that anticipates what those big needs are so that we can be communicating with our partners in city government what those upcoming needs are, what we think that they might be, etc.

27
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:21,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And those things for which we would be wanting or needing capital funding to be able to complete the process.

28
00:04:21,864 --> 00:04:26,285
[SPEAKER_01]: So before COVID, there was a process.

29
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,406
[SPEAKER_01]: It has changed over time.

30
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:30,667
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a process.

31
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:41,085
[SPEAKER_01]: back right before COVID, I guess I would say maybe in the preceding year where like a sort of a four year chart that looks like this was produced.

32
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:55,477
[SPEAKER_01]: And it listed each of the buildings and what on a year by year basis was on the capital like roadmap for that building and sort of estimates of what was being accounted for.

33
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:58,039
[SPEAKER_01]: And then during COVID,

34
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:07,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Our process actually sort of got absorbed into the city of Method's capital improvement plan, which is this document.

35
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:16,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a number of things from a school perspective in this, in this document as well.

36
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:20,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to find the page that talks about some of those things.

37
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:24,544
[SPEAKER_04]: And Memogram, this was produced by the Collins Center, correct?

38
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:25,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

39
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:42,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, we have this report outlined 27 projects for the schools at a cost of 12.4% of the total costs outlined.

40
00:05:55,542 --> 00:06:01,843
[SPEAKER_01]: total anticipated cost of $60 million and a percentage of total costs being 35%.

41
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:10,705
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and there's a whole lot of information about what those 27 projects are that were outlined at the time.

42
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:20,667
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the time is, I think the time is right for us as a school committee to sort of take back the ownership of tracking all of that.

43
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:21,407
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think

44
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:30,394
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true, especially because we now have a electronic ticketing system for all of our like maintenance.

45
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:38,986
[SPEAKER_01]: projects and requests across the district right so work orders can be put into like a formal tracking system that I think.

46
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:47,129
[SPEAKER_01]: can maybe help us sort of make light work of what these capital requests are so that we can then put them on the roadmap.

47
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:54,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Dr. Cushing, I was hoping you could tell us a little bit about how that system is working versus like what we used to do, which was

48
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,725
[SPEAKER_01]: ticketing system of sorts, you know, but via email and much harder to sort of report and track.

49
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of capabilities do we have today?

50
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:13,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we now have the system is known as Operations Hero, and it is a full service ticketing system for both custodial

51
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:17,061
[SPEAKER_04]: for maintenance and technology if we want.

52
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:23,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Presently we're running our ticketing for technology under a separate system, but we're going to see how this system works to be able to merge.

53
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,957
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as custodial and maintenance, what happens now is we're having principals,

54
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:33,959
[SPEAKER_04]: and assistant principals and directors enter.

55
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:45,383
[SPEAKER_04]: We were worried, I was worried about just opening the ticketing system up to every employee in the district, that it would be flooded immediately with everybody's concern from the lowest to the highest need.

56
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:51,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was worried about the ability to filter what was high priority.

57
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:53,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're doing essentially a soft open.

58
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:58,107
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have about 40 tickets in right now.

59
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:09,938
[SPEAKER_04]: are ranging from roof leaks to fixing broken water filling stations to a number of other issues that are coming up.

60
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:20,949
[SPEAKER_04]: We have training scheduled for our maintenance staff because what's really nice about this ticketing system is as we install new equipment and as we maintain existing equipment,

61
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:33,839
[SPEAKER_04]: We can put QR codes on them so the equipment will have a life cycle so that we'll be able to see the maintenance history of every piece of equipment and every district asset as we move forward.

62
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will be able to start pulling reports from them.

63
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:42,585
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of my trainings that's scheduled for upcoming.

64
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So did you not list custodians?

65
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet.

66
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:47,751
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

67
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:49,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they just seem like a group that- Yeah.

68
00:08:49,852 --> 00:09:03,500
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start with senior custodians, who then can distribute the work to junior custodians and make sure, as their contract states, that it's well organized and distributed fairly.

69
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:07,343
[SPEAKER_06]: My experience is that custodians actually run into a lot of things.

70
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:08,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

71
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:09,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you mean to enter?

72
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:10,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

73
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:10,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

74
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,265
[SPEAKER_04]: We will.

75
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,386
[SPEAKER_04]: We will do that as well.

76
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:12,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

77
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, teachers do, but you know.

78
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:17,589
[SPEAKER_06]: custodians are in every room hall every day so.

79
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:20,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

80
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:28,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so then would it make sense for us to identify the things that are on this plan that maybe still aren't done and need to be done?

81
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:28,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

82
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:42,637
[SPEAKER_01]: and push them into the system, as well as to go, maybe ask you to go through the list of 27 projects in the city's capital plan and push those in so that we can generate a list.

83
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:50,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, perhaps what we, so that's like startup, right?

84
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,681
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can get everything sort of pushed into the system.

85
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:58,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm wondering if on an annual basis, we set some sort of like timeline or schedule around like,

86
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:03,925
[SPEAKER_01]: when will we have an annual capital planning discussion?

87
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:10,447
[SPEAKER_01]: So that this committee sort of has that clear marching order, maybe we do it later in the evening.

88
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:17,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not such a like, sort of working session, but more of a presentation of what those things are.

89
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So the community sort of can understand what those things, what those what those plans are and when.

90
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:28,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think my suggestion would be that that happen

91
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:35,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in May.

92
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:57,129
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually am almost wondering if we set this up to be like a November, December activity so that before the halfway point of the year and long before budget and long before free cash certifies, like we are proactively being able to like say and report out.

93
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:00,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what, you know, what we believe that we need.

94
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:02,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?

95
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:02,992
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense.

96
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:18,280
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also, I wonder if it's this committee, um, that would be really, this subcommittee to be really helpful for me and other people working with me on operations to say, all right, when are we going to make asks of this new stabilization fund?

97
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, prior really prioritization of projects.

98
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:26,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've presented on safety and security.

99
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:33,717
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know that our new schools, which we should not call new schools anymore, are now approaching midlife.

100
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:37,585
[SPEAKER_04]: at 22 and 24 years old and that, right.

101
00:11:37,685 --> 00:12:00,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, so it's, and so moving forward with various projects, there are certain things like the HVAC projects at the Andrews and New England, replacing kitchen equipment, various things along those lines that we just want to make sure that the committee is well-informed, but is also approving expenditures.

102
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,370
[SPEAKER_04]: As an example, we have done significant

103
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:07,953
[SPEAKER_04]: That as electric rates rise.

104
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:14,715
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're using less electricity, but we also need to pay for those over 60 month payoff.

105
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:17,415
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on bill financing.

106
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:22,997
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, but our usage would be much higher and our costs would be much higher.

107
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,832
[SPEAKER_04]: without lowering our carbon footprint.

108
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:32,516
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've done that at the end, we've done that at the McGlynn, we've done that at the Roberts, we've done parts of that at Medford High School.

109
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:39,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though Medford High School is sunsetting, hopefully, pray, you know, that's still six years out.

110
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:40,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, five years.

111
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:41,522
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of electricity.

112
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:42,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

113
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:49,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I would like to hopefully at some point present, say, the Brooks and the Missituk as the last two schools,

114
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:58,750
[SPEAKER_04]: You as the body have the ability to look at the numbers and give approval, not give approval to these $300,000 projects.

115
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

116
00:12:59,630 --> 00:12:59,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

117
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, sorry, go ahead.

118
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:09,472
[SPEAKER_02]: No, my question is how this intersects with the building and grounds subcommittee, but I think your question was more directly related to it.

119
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:11,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good question.

120
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:13,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Buildings and grounds has

121
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:18,076
[SPEAKER_01]: historically like done many different things.

122
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:29,741
[SPEAKER_01]: But in its like last iterations, they were focused more on like, community driven, like beautification efforts.

123
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:33,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, the more like,

124
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:36,029
[SPEAKER_01]: tactical day-to-day stuff.

125
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:49,754
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that may still be the right thing for them versus, I'm almost thinking like this committee will get together to sort of craft what ultimately according to our policy really should be happening at a committee of the whole.

126
00:13:50,374 --> 00:14:00,878
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we think about like doing our work in October to collect, to make sure that like we have, you know, we have a report out of the ticketing system, we can sort of

127
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:03,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be helpful.

128
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,187
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could craft what we think is like the right.

129
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:10,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Prioritization and then bring it to a committee, the whole, to present that.

130
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:12,152
[SPEAKER_01]: To the entire committee.

131
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:14,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the entire committee's involvement in that.

132
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:17,617
[SPEAKER_01]: That might make some sense in terms of like a flow.

133
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:18,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And then certainly.

134
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:21,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the whole committee's there,

135
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:43,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually not, which makes the numbers, but also I'm thinking that like so we as a full committee would set out and put our stamp of approval on the capital improvement plan annually.

136
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:46,394
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a bunch of input.

137
00:14:46,874 --> 00:14:53,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get to that meeting, we don't need to know about the paint fixes here and there and the water filter replacements.

138
00:14:54,075 --> 00:15:01,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, when Dr. Cushing goes through all of the training and reporting, he'll be able to give us a report that's a meaningful starting place.

139
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:13,210
[SPEAKER_06]: As a committee would approve it and that the individual items, you know, we would send that over presumably to the city for a request for the funds.

140
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:21,641
[SPEAKER_06]: They would give us a certain amount, but they would not get to decide the order of that list like we we've decided this is the order of what we're going to do.

141
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:26,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the request that we're putting how much we want, and you give us as much as you can.

142
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:40,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we starting at the top of our list go down, but then each of those projects actually seems like would be things that would go into their buildings and grounds committee to monitor and check on progress and like, how is it happening?

143
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,090
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just my thought.

144
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:44,343
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that makes sense.

145
00:15:44,364 --> 00:15:49,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing I was going to say, when you said it's time for the school to take this back and make the decision, absolutely.

146
00:15:49,587 --> 00:16:00,215
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we need to build into whatever our procedure is, a regular like report out according to the city or according because we need to be in their plan in their capital planning.

147
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:01,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

148
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:02,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

149
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:09,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that intersection, what our priorities are, that intersection is a very interesting one, because there

150
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:19,485
[SPEAKER_06]: there may be projects that are on our plan that the city in whole manages in every imaginable way.

151
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:25,271
[SPEAKER_06]: And then projects that we are managing in whole and then projects where we're both managing it.

152
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:32,037
[SPEAKER_06]: So like what it looks like on their plan is an interesting question.

153
00:16:32,077 --> 00:16:32,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I mean, cause

154
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:50,042
[SPEAKER_06]: do we want their plan to just have like a, you know, if it was a pie, like there's a pie slice and it just says schools, or do we want their pie to have our, you know, like our list may in fact be a hundred items long.

155
00:16:51,466 --> 00:17:04,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Their presentation is not intended to be at that level of detail, which is why I like what they're doing, you know, they're turning all municipal roofs to solar right like we want in on that we've got a part of that right.

156
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:13,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I think also we have to, we also being in on that, I think we also have to make a decision like we're not just going to do X slipper roofs.

157
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:19,535
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we want a full roof replacement with full insulation and it will last for another 30 years.

158
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:19,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

159
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:21,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

160
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,700
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where taking it back is really the point.

161
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

162
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:30,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think that the difference between buildings and grounds and capital planning

163
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:44,070
[SPEAKER_04]: is that capital planning should be big vision, kind of setting the standard for where the district needs to go with its about 1.2 million square feet of space over our multiple buildings.

164
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:53,337
[SPEAKER_04]: And as one example, I was planning to submit a request to CPA to do a historic assessment of the Curtis Tufts

165
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,938
[SPEAKER_04]: to see what that facility would need.

166
00:17:56,438 --> 00:18:02,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, given the events of last night in our discussion to co-locate, is that something that we should still continue?

167
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:09,463
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's something I see as a capital planning decision, kind of guiding the leadership of the district.

168
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,824
[SPEAKER_01]: So two things sort of come to mind.

169
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:16,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a conversation with Alicia Hunt last week.

170
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:32,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking about this process of recommissioning buildings, which essentially looks at everything and says, here's how you restore this building to its original purpose and function.

171
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,586
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what you have to do in order to get there.

172
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:40,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, the idea is we should do that

173
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:44,510
[SPEAKER_01]: one building at a time in rotation over a number of years.

174
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:47,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And then no building is ever more than like six or seven years out.

175
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:53,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's enough to like have that sort of big picture point of view.

176
00:18:55,718 --> 00:19:06,665
[SPEAKER_01]: The city has indicated a willingness to do that across this, for all of our outbuildings, not this building, not Curtis Tufts, right now.

177
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:10,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia would, her opinion is that

178
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:22,119
[SPEAKER_01]: the OPM that they're bringing on to do the Andrews McGlynn project, they are the right people to help us do this too because of their deep familiarity with the district.

179
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she was definitely like sort of favorable to working with them to help facilitate that process.

180
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:37,128
[SPEAKER_01]: But to her point, like when you recommission a building, what you get out of it is a list of like problems to fix.

181
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:40,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not recommissioned at the end of the process.

182
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,650
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the beginning.

183
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,031
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the beginning of the process.

184
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:45,933
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the creation of your to-do list.

185
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:59,281
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of those things should feed either work orders for the maintenance team to do because they have capacity to do X or Y or Z, or something that has to go on the capital plan.

186
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:05,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, the output of the recommissioning study should go into the ticketing system so that we have one place

187
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:07,746
[SPEAKER_01]: for all of this to go.

188
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:20,473
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Alicia can be a real ally in that and she's indicated a willingness to attend meetings provided that we can like say hey this is the meeting I want you to attend because she's got a lot on her plate.

189
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:22,294
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great news.

190
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:22,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

191
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:23,935
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes a lot of sense.

192
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:34,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I also like you know the if we can do the recommissioning studies pretty much all at once then we don't end up with a scenario where one school is getting

193
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:37,366
[SPEAKER_01]: something different.

194
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:42,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of lovely things, while there are things that are more serious at other schools that just haven't been put on the list yet.

195
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

196
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:48,975
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that having all those at once will allow us to prioritize from a district perspective.

197
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:49,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

198
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

199
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:59,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, not to discount our current OPM, however, the city of Method has recently contracted with three architectural firms

200
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:02,999
[SPEAKER_04]: for what they're calling house doctor services.

201
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:05,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Say again?

202
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I never even heard these words.

203
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:14,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically they're on-call architectural firms to assist with various things.

204
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of those happens to be the original architect for the five schools.

205
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:21,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that HMFA?

206
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:22,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

207
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:22,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

208
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:22,357
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

209
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're sort of another potential that could be part, you know, be part of the conversation.

210
00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:46,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I wrong to just, you know, just to check me on this, like that any OPM and anybody we hire to do this is gonna provide us a reasonably functioning, the reports not look terribly different from one to the next.

211
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:48,470
[SPEAKER_01]: No, probably not, no.

212
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be that BTQ, I think that's their name,

213
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:55,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the OPM work?

214
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:56,915
[SPEAKER_04]: They're our designer.

215
00:21:57,075 --> 00:21:58,236
[SPEAKER_04]: JLL is the OPM.

216
00:21:58,376 --> 00:21:58,676
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

217
00:21:58,836 --> 00:21:59,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

218
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:01,579
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

219
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:06,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought she was talking about B2Q to actually execute the recommissioning study.

220
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:09,165
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, we can find that out.

221
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:10,687
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not overly concerned about it.

222
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:19,314
[SPEAKER_01]: The other question I had is, timing-wise, if we were to say our process is from October 1st to October 15th,

223
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:33,653
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to push out a proactive email to the principals of the buildings to say, if there is something that belongs on our capital plan like speak now submit your tickets, so that we can we can catch all of those and categorize them.

224
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:38,239
[SPEAKER_01]: And then between, you know, late October early know, maybe.

225
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:45,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Late October into November, maybe we'll give ourselves the month of November because it's November and you know, it's a short month.

226
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:49,765
[SPEAKER_01]: We sort of meet and put together sort of a starting point.

227
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:56,331
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in December, one of our meetings becomes or part, you know, part of one of our meetings becomes a committee of the whole where we review that.

228
00:22:57,091 --> 00:23:00,595
[SPEAKER_01]: That timing all works in the lead up to like,

229
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,002
[SPEAKER_01]: free cash being available if we are dependent on free cash for something.

230
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:10,885
[SPEAKER_01]: It also predates or precedes our budget cycle.

231
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:14,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Because some of that stuff will not be stuff that can be waiting for.

232
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:14,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

233
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:22,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And presumably if there's a stabilization fund, you could like tap into that at any time, but also it's not like an endless pot of money.

234
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:25,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So that prioritization is needed.

235
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:29,915
[SPEAKER_01]: The one question I have is where does the CPC

236
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a good point.

237
00:23:33,591 --> 00:23:35,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

238
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:37,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

239
00:23:37,354 --> 00:23:38,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

240
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:39,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

241
00:23:39,756 --> 00:23:40,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

242
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:41,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

243
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:42,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

244
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:43,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

245
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:44,500
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

246
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

247
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:46,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

248
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:57,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I don't exactly know like when are their applications do I would just want us to a rolling to like I did too.

249
00:23:58,066 --> 00:24:02,167
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are certain things that are rolling, but I, but I thought there were like rounds.

250
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:09,910
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just want to make sure like wherever that fits like It all fits into this process because I would hate for us to be like, this is great.

251
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could get CPC funding and like, oh, we just missed it.

252
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,171
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want us to like set Oh, okay.

253
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:15,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Why a

254
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:19,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Round opens July 31st.

255
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Eligibility forms due September 10th.

256
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:26,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Full applications due October 8 and 22nd.

257
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:28,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Application presentations to the committee.

258
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:29,112
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for this year.

259
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:40,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also submitting an off-cycle application for three bicycle repair and bike pump stations to be installed at the McGlynn, the Andrews, and the high school.

260
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:41,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.

261
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:44,483
[SPEAKER_02]: In special circumstances, off-cycle applications may be considered.

262
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:51,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Applicants must demonstrate an emergent public need and evidence of seeking alternative funding to the grant.

263
00:24:51,864 --> 00:24:56,345
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this timing works well because we will actually sort of know.

264
00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:57,945
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll finish the budget.

265
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:00,665
[SPEAKER_06]: We will have an idea.

266
00:25:00,685 --> 00:25:02,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, pre-cash will have been certified.

267
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:05,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything going into stabilization fund will have been completed by July 1.

268
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:09,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will really be

269
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:38,813
[SPEAKER_02]: way ahead of the game and like here's the list of things and we're just sitting around waiting for you know the the free cash certification city's budget picture to come become clear yeah okay um in response to your comment about the principles and i think we need some threshold guidelines on what constitutes okay little project i like that yeah i

270
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:45,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jerry could actually really give good information on what constitutes a capital project.

271
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:48,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jerry.

272
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:49,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jerry.

273
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you mind sitting over here?

274
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:54,925
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a video right there.

275
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see.

276
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:06,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, DESE publishes guidelines for net school spending and

277
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:26,310
[SPEAKER_00]: I will refresh my memory on the current guidelines, but typically any project that is over $150,000 per project per school would be excluded from net school spending.

278
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:35,006
[SPEAKER_00]: which means it wouldn't count towards the required spending to access Chapter 70 funds.

279
00:26:35,706 --> 00:26:38,327
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 100% on the city.

280
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:55,851
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was in Chelsea, we tried to put those projects in the capital plan for city only funding and then projects that wouldn't meet that requirement or wouldn't meet that threshold would be in the

281
00:26:56,892 --> 00:27:05,616
[SPEAKER_00]: The school budget is not an issue if you happen to do a $200,000 out of the school budget.

282
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:09,238
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wouldn't count towards net school spending at the end of the year.

283
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:12,520
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically, the city is way over net school spending.

284
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:19,683
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd never put your Chapter 70 funding in jeopardy by doing that.

285
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:21,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

286
00:27:22,913 --> 00:27:39,239
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the interesting thing about the McGlynn is that's really two schools, so you're going to have a $1,000 limit if you were doing a project, say, HVAC that affected both schools.

287
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:43,865
[SPEAKER_00]: you could split the cost of that project over those schools.

288
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:56,348
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that would be true if you had funding to do something over four or five schools, then you could allocate it for the purpose of the limitations.

289
00:27:56,748 --> 00:28:05,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, because the McGlynn is two schools, is that limit in place if we really just do something like in one of the sides?

290
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,791
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just treated- Yeah, we just applied at one school.

291
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:12,167
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the limit is not 300 for that.

292
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:12,707
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be 150.

293
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:16,211
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.

294
00:28:16,851 --> 00:28:28,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have found two other presentations beyond the 27 projects that are listed here, so in the city's plan.

295
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:34,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just wanted to run through because they're old, but I don't think that necessarily means they're not

296
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:36,707
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're done.

297
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:40,789
[SPEAKER_01]: So this list has, it's mostly lighting.

298
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:47,371
[SPEAKER_01]: So Peter, I think that's a question in terms of cafeteria and exterior lighting.

299
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:52,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So that has, so on those, it also mentions hallway lighting in some places.

300
00:28:53,592 --> 00:29:01,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So the entire McGlynn with some spotty areas has had all, and by spotty areas, I mean like a few offices,

301
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:05,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And a few locations that I'm working with the vendor to have replaced.

302
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:10,428
[SPEAKER_04]: We have replaced all of the lighting at the McGlynn and Roberts.

303
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:16,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're currently working on an exterior project at the Andrews and the McGlynn.

304
00:29:18,797 --> 00:29:39,108
[SPEAKER_04]: But all of that has been replaced with high efficiency, 25-year lifespan, no need to replace anything, LED, that both daylight harvest, so they will turn off if it's bright enough, and they also have dimming capabilities, and then automatic off after a set period.

305
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:43,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I just want to finish going through this list.

306
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:49,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Roberts School exterior lighting, are there exterior lighting needs that have not been addressed?

307
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:50,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, it's been addressed.

308
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:50,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

309
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Missittuck has not yet been done.

310
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:55,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Brooks has not yet been done.

311
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:56,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Curtis Tufts.

312
00:29:57,805 --> 00:29:58,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Curtis Tufts has been done.

313
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:01,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole building LED.

314
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:02,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say whole building.

315
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:03,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I know hallways.

316
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:04,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to check on the classrooms.

317
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

318
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,556
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can check on that one.

319
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:10,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

320
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:12,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Automotive shop LED?

321
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:17,179
[SPEAKER_04]: All shops have been 100% upgraded to LED lights.

322
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:17,579
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

323
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:19,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrews, halls and stairwells?

324
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Complete.

325
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:23,161
[SPEAKER_01]: And whole building LED?

326
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:24,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

327
00:30:24,942 --> 00:30:27,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to check on the classrooms for Andrews.

328
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:29,004
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some question there.

329
00:30:29,504 --> 00:30:31,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you visit the Robertson and McGlynn,

330
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:46,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other schools, the Mississauga, the Andrews, and the Roberts, you'll see that what were hanging light fixtures have now been flush mounted, which teachers have reported, the few that I've talked to about it, like, wow, it just really opens up the room.

331
00:30:47,672 --> 00:30:50,733
[SPEAKER_04]: There are still hanging light fixtures in the Andrews.

332
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:56,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if those were just light bulb upgrade and replacements for LED.

333
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:56,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

334
00:30:56,977 --> 00:30:57,077
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

335
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:58,278
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can check on that one.

336
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:02,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on the Andrews School, and this list, by the way, this list is from like 2017, 2018.

337
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to make sure there's stuff that's still there.

338
00:31:05,941 --> 00:31:07,001
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking it forward.

339
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:10,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrews School, it says controls upgrade for ADR.

340
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:13,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't even actually know what that means.

341
00:31:14,544 --> 00:31:15,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to look it up.

342
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:16,305
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a feedback thing.

343
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:17,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

344
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:20,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me do it quick.

345
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Automatic dimming, I don't know.

346
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:27,455
[SPEAKER_02]: All-day refrigeration, no.

347
00:31:27,975 --> 00:31:32,317
[SPEAKER_02]: ADR systems automatically adjust HVAC.

348
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:36,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think that that control was replaced.

349
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the pandemic.

350
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:41,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

351
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:45,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's not us, that's public safety.

352
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:46,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Andrews.

353
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,953
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find it funny to know that they said the Andrews HVAC upgrades were going to cost $25,000.

354
00:31:53,453 --> 00:32:01,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So I also did just share with you, I located from our previous finance director, Mr. Murphy,

355
00:32:01,874 --> 00:32:06,698
[SPEAKER_04]: he had put together a CAP, a CIP.

356
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've shared that with everybody around this table.

357
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:24,332
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would say, and this is no fault of Mr. Murphy, but I would say that a comprehensive researching of what things cost, the numbers that are in there, I don't know are accurate.

358
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:31,277
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, just in my research on some things, are woefully more expensive.

359
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

360
00:32:34,431 --> 00:32:34,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

361
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:36,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have nut allergy?

362
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:36,912
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

363
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:40,414
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but thank you for asking.

364
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:47,257
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so then the second plan, just to bring us to current.

365
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:48,958
[SPEAKER_04]: This is draft number three?

366
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:50,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, draft number three.

367
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Two air compressors at the Brooks.

368
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,493
[SPEAKER_01]: five air compressors at Missittuck, two air compressors at Roberts.

369
00:32:59,174 --> 00:33:01,456
[SPEAKER_01]: They all were replaced, is that correct?

370
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:10,424
[SPEAKER_04]: In the summer of 2019, there was a free cash allotment from the mayor and the city council at the time that allowed for all of that compressor work to be completed.

371
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:12,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

372
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:15,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew's new roof, that actually got done.

373
00:33:16,904 --> 00:33:25,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to qualify new roof because what it was, was a, I'll call it a film that was put over the entire roof.

374
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:30,615
[SPEAKER_04]: It's white that helps reflect the sun, but it also extends the life of that roof.

375
00:33:31,335 --> 00:33:34,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alicia Hunt has said numerous times that it extends it significantly.

376
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:46,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe her, but I always question, like, should we consider the R value insulation on that roof as part of, you know,

377
00:33:47,176 --> 00:33:48,057
[SPEAKER_04]: where we move forward.

378
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:48,737
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

379
00:33:50,138 --> 00:33:54,080
[SPEAKER_01]: McGlynn Complex had auditorium seating work for $25,000.

380
00:33:56,821 --> 00:34:01,424
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say that it happened because there really isn't any issue with the seating in there.

381
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:06,607
[SPEAKER_04]: But the seating in the auditoriums definitely does take abuse.

382
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:13,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there are about 25 seats in the high school auditorium right now that are damaged and need repair.

383
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:13,510
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

384
00:34:15,431 --> 00:34:21,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the high school replace or replace repair fire alarm sealing system in 2019.

385
00:34:22,457 --> 00:34:30,284
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't speak to whether or not that was done, but I do know that we did significant fire alarm work this past fall.

386
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:34,828
[SPEAKER_04]: The fire alarm system that meant for high school requires constant attention.

387
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:38,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, as members of signs the warrants he knows.

388
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:41,594
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so and then we had.

389
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:45,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put security improvements to the side.

390
00:34:45,874 --> 00:34:47,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's an ongoing conversation.

391
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:52,416
[SPEAKER_01]: The Andrews outside curb repairs, those curbs are still not installed.

392
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:53,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?

393
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:55,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are some that are just sitting there.

394
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:57,357
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some that have been done.

395
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:58,977
[SPEAKER_04]: My whole time on the school committee.

396
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:08,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is an item here for the McGlynn complex, asphalt and tire complex, including Andrews side curb repairs.

397
00:35:09,697 --> 00:35:12,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so all of that is still like in progress, right?

398
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:13,780
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not complete.

399
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I would consider it in progress.

400
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:20,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year, the DPW, um, ground, ground the road down.

401
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:20,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

402
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:32,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was significantly worse than it was, and they did a temporary like paving job, but there's a longer term plan on the city side since the city took that over.

403
00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:39,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior to this, that, that road was the responsibility, 100% of the Metropolitan Public Schools, lighting, curbing, everything.

404
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it just changed last year.

405
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:43,343
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have the capacity to manage it.

406
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:49,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'm not going to worry about some of the later things for high school.

407
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:58,071
[SPEAKER_01]: McGlynn complex, roof rebuild, air compressors, and chiller contact.

408
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:04,908
[SPEAKER_01]: contact compressor, all of that is being handled with this HVAC project that will go in for the system to be tracked.

409
00:36:05,368 --> 00:36:23,399
[SPEAKER_04]: The roof rebuild is somewhere, that's up in the air in question, but what I did notice in one of the documents there from either Collins, when those came out, they suggested a five-year roof rebuild with one each year, and those plans are at least five years old and we have not stopped.

410
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:37,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would have some sort of roof assessment, which I think we can sort of let recommissioning guide priority there, which is fine.

411
00:36:39,942 --> 00:36:49,629
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that's on here looks like water heaters at the Andrews.

412
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:53,679
[SPEAKER_04]: The water heaters have been replaced.

413
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,041
[SPEAKER_06]: We thought they were going to cost $80,000.

414
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:57,022
[SPEAKER_06]: What were they actually?

415
00:36:57,042 --> 00:37:01,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what they were, but it was another number.

416
00:37:02,427 --> 00:37:10,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And for full disclosure, the hot water heater at the Brooks has failed.

417
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,535
[SPEAKER_04]: It's original to the building.

418
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:17,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're currently trying to work through what that would take, but I think that we should go.

419
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:20,741
[SPEAKER_04]: My recommendation is that we go through a formal RFP process.

420
00:37:21,982 --> 00:37:28,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I was seeking an emergency waiver of that, but we're able to mitigate the need for hot water right now.

421
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:33,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's in the district's best financial interest to go through an RFP process.

422
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:40,626
[SPEAKER_02]: To what extent does Waterheed's failure at the Brooks predict Robert's?

423
00:37:42,148 --> 00:37:42,830
[SPEAKER_04]: They already failed.

424
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,651
[SPEAKER_02]: They already failed.

425
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:44,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

426
00:37:44,577 --> 00:37:50,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a prediction, but it already happened.

427
00:37:50,498 --> 00:38:05,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were those were originally 400 gallon water heaters because there was no way to if you ever want to take a tour of the mechanical rooms of the district, there's no real way to get things in and out.

428
00:38:06,942 --> 00:38:13,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And so rather than doing to doing one 400, there are two hundred and ninety

429
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:16,427
[SPEAKER_04]: or a 200 gallon water heater.

430
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:17,408
[SPEAKER_06]: The one here is pretty cool.

431
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,650
[SPEAKER_06]: There's stuff that is never going to be gone until they demolish this building.

432
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in an old high school.

433
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:25,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that stuff still there too?

434
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:26,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

435
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:29,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the condo conversion in 84.

436
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:37,199
[SPEAKER_00]: That could also be for redundancy in case one fails.

437
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:42,002
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some, which is a good way to go.

438
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:46,562
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said CPC applications are like July?

439
00:38:47,022 --> 00:38:48,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Opens in July, due in September.

440
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:48,663
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

441
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:50,403
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the July 31st date?

442
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:51,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to be able to put that on our board.

443
00:38:51,543 --> 00:38:52,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That was eligibility.

444
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:56,425
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should be submitting a letter before you do a poll.

445
00:38:56,445 --> 00:38:56,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

446
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:57,325
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, got it.

447
00:38:57,385 --> 00:38:59,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Jen, do you remember what the playground services cost?

448
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:00,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.

449
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:01,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can look it up.

450
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:03,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying it was $15,000.

451
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:04,287
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

452
00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:05,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were the $120,000.

453
00:39:05,688 --> 00:39:05,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

454
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:08,188
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, all right.

455
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:09,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think they were the $120,000.

456
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,329
[SPEAKER_01]: They were huge.

457
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:11,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were not inexpensive.

458
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know McQuinn's was going to be half a million.

459
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:13,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

460
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,379
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, you know, many years ago.

461
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:16,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

462
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:22,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I think it was, sorry, the surfacing at Roberts was 109, 540.

463
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:23,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

464
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:25,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And what year was that in?

465
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:29,066
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like early when we started.

466
00:39:29,106 --> 00:39:29,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

467
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:29,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

468
00:39:34,987 --> 00:39:43,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay, so I think from a sort of process and cadence perspective and Jerry like, please weigh in what we talked about was like.

469
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:52,273
[SPEAKER_01]: a desire to use the ticketing system, sort of push all of the things into it so that it can come, it can be tracked there.

470
00:39:53,094 --> 00:40:03,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the beginning of October, we would send out a reminder to principals that like, we're gonna do our, we're gonna start our capital planning process for the annual year.

471
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,683
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if they have anything else, they need to like get those things into the system so we can be considering them.

472
00:40:09,544 --> 00:40:12,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in October and November, this committee will meet to like,

473
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:16,070
[SPEAKER_01]: lisa smith, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PB

474
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:41,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should invite Alicia to our like our subcommittee meeting.

475
00:40:56,255 --> 00:41:02,077
[SPEAKER_01]: especially because I think that is more likely to be happening in her work day, which might be easier for her.

476
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:05,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And then certainly she wants to come to the committee of the whole.

477
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:10,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of what we're talking about in terms of sort of revising our process.

478
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:11,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense to you?

479
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:13,482
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes complete sense.

480
00:41:13,622 --> 00:41:23,326
[SPEAKER_00]: You finish up the capital end of February, middle of March maybe, and then you're into your budget cycle.

481
00:41:26,689 --> 00:41:27,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

482
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:33,573
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't need your notes to write this up.

483
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:35,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I couldn't.

484
00:41:35,194 --> 00:41:38,475
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where the audio is.

485
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:39,436
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's fine.

486
00:41:40,156 --> 00:41:41,357
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the next step.

487
00:41:42,444 --> 00:41:49,289
[SPEAKER_01]: is that we probably can present the process to the committee.

488
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:54,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to write it up after we meet so that everybody knows what to expect.

489
00:41:54,892 --> 00:41:59,856
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually something that we do need to do in one of our upcoming meetings in June, because that's what we said we would do.

490
00:42:01,797 --> 00:42:09,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, Peter, I can pass these old items to you to put into operations hero.

491
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:12,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe.

492
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:28,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we even like you tell us when you're ready to meet with like sort of everything that you can see pushed in and we can look at what that reporting looks like and tweak it even in advance of this next official cycle.

493
00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:38,742
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would be happy to like do that on Zoom over the summer at some point if there's a time that works for everybody, just so that it happens when things are not quite as chaotic as the beginning of the school year.

494
00:42:39,482 --> 00:42:42,245
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a to-do list for Peter of things that he was going to look into.

495
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:43,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

496
00:42:44,092 --> 00:42:46,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need that investigated before?

497
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:51,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we need to investigate it before we tell the committee what the process is.

498
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:54,796
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think before we meet in the summer, yes.

499
00:42:55,977 --> 00:42:56,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?

500
00:42:56,937 --> 00:42:57,277
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

501
00:42:57,777 --> 00:43:00,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I feel like I welcome summer meetings on this, just so you know.

502
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:01,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

503
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:03,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I'm nuts, but I. No, I understand.

504
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do think you're nuts, but that's not really.

505
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,281
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not why.

506
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:07,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

507
00:43:09,122 --> 00:43:11,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly have enough information to actually draft a policy.

508
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:13,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on.

509
00:43:14,785 --> 00:43:16,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Repeating it all for Jerry.

510
00:43:18,426 --> 00:43:19,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I can.

511
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:23,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to have another meeting here or should I just like.

512
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:27,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we necessarily need to, if.

513
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:31,473
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're willing to take a crack at writing the policy on our behalf.

514
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:41,362
[SPEAKER_06]: School handbook policy, like that format feels like that would be good for this as well.

515
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:46,286
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, date ranges, phases, who's responsible.

516
00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:52,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, literally a sentence for each phase is sort of like, why are we doing this?

517
00:43:54,474 --> 00:43:57,437
[SPEAKER_06]: And then bullets about the things that will have to happen, so.

518
00:43:58,772 --> 00:44:04,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, do you need any, do we need to include any information about the relationship with building and grounds and or the road?

519
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:06,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll add that in there, sure.

520
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:17,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because I think we, what we thought was, Terri, was that the buildings and ground would sort of like get the projects to, once they are in action, like once they're funded.

521
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:18,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

522
00:44:18,112 --> 00:44:18,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

523
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:20,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather than here opening.

524
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:20,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

525
00:44:20,414 --> 00:44:20,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

526
00:44:23,857 --> 00:44:43,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then, I mean, for some of them we can access, these house doctor contracts are available, so we identify a project, we talk to one of those firms, get a scope of work to do the project management, write any kind of construction documents that are needed.

527
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,945
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, do you have any?

528
00:44:51,185 --> 00:44:56,430
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things we talked about earlier was they do the bidding too.

529
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:59,413
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they'd produce the bid documents for the women.

530
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:00,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

531
00:45:01,275 --> 00:45:02,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's I like easy.

532
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Not cheap, but I mean.

533
00:45:06,341 --> 00:45:06,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

534
00:45:06,801 --> 00:45:11,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but that's what you're going to hold the contractor accountable.

535
00:45:11,443 --> 00:45:14,064
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be precise.

536
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:20,327
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things we talked about was we're going to have the school's capital plan.

537
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:33,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Collins Center document has just all, it's separated, but it's still, it's like this big mashed pile of capital for the whole community.

538
00:45:34,472 --> 00:45:43,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things I'm curious about, if you've seen in other places is like, so we have our capital plan and then the city has a capital plan.

539
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:45,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And do we like the budget?

540
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:51,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Medford Public Schools budget will just be school department, a number.

541
00:45:52,202 --> 00:46:01,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that kind of what you think happens in other communities where in their capital plan, it says school department and a number, or do they have our plan sort of like

542
00:46:02,614 --> 00:46:03,855
[SPEAKER_06]: blown out into theirs?

543
00:46:05,935 --> 00:46:24,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, it would be, if they do it on an annual basis, so there'd be a list of all the city departments, and the school department would be one of them, and it would list the projects that roll up to a total number that's in the city capital plan.

544
00:46:25,143 --> 00:46:31,165
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it has to be accepted by the city, so they have the option to say, we don't have the bandwidth to do it.

545
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:45,168
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when we kind of through budget management, we have sufficient money, you know, at the end of the year, we could maybe accommodate a project to kind of spend down our money that falls through the cracks.

546
00:46:45,528 --> 00:46:51,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes it's, as you're finding out by the time you go out to bid, you're $100,000 short.

547
00:46:53,445 --> 00:47:02,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes it'd be a combination of city operation funds and capital if needed.

548
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:06,870
[SPEAKER_06]: But the actual spending and all that, your office is essentially who deals with that stuff.

549
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:11,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So, cause I'm for the, I was going back to the definition.

550
00:47:12,052 --> 00:47:18,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's actually capital, it's not in our budget.

551
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:23,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can be in our budget, but it's how you report it.

552
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:37,482
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole end-of-year report is designed, well, it collects a lot of financial data from across the state, and then it's also used for compliance for net school spending.

553
00:47:38,102 --> 00:47:48,789
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be DESE publishers on their website, every community's compliance with net school spending, and it determines that compliance from the end-of-year reports.

554
00:47:49,389 --> 00:47:54,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are managing a project and it's over $150,000, there's

555
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:08,707
[SPEAKER_00]: in the account classification system, there's one spot where you put the projects that you can charge to school funding.

556
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:13,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another spot where you put the projects that are outside of school funding.

557
00:48:14,148 --> 00:48:23,211
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's also like large equipment purchases can fall outside of net school spending too.

558
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:26,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad I don't have to do this stuff daily.

559
00:48:30,595 --> 00:48:34,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it just like gets into your muscle memory eventually.

560
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:42,639
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can send you the language that might help you with the policy.

561
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

562
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

563
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:58,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like maybe we just need to make a motion to present our policy and process to the school committee and that member Rousseau is going to draft on our behalf.

564
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:00,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make that motion.

565
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:03,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion by Member White.

566
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:04,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll second that.

567
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:05,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Seconded by Member Ruseau.

568
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:09,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we're in person.

569
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:09,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

570
00:49:09,795 --> 00:49:10,495
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor?

571
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:11,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

572
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:11,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

573
00:49:11,556 --> 00:49:12,176
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

574
00:49:12,337 --> 00:49:13,157
[SPEAKER_01]: All those opposed?

575
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:14,278
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only three of us, so.

576
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Only three of us, so we're good.

577
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:16,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion passes.

578
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just add a quick update of a major capital project that's going on right now?

579
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:27,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So the McGlynn Universally Accessible Playground is in the neighborhood of 50% completion.

580
00:49:28,188 --> 00:49:35,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, I hope that members are able to join one of the two tours over the next two weeks.

581
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:39,731
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really coming out very nicely.

582
00:49:41,172 --> 00:49:50,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a representative project of, I think, what good planning and good community involvement is.

583
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:54,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know Member Graham came last week so she can speak if she so chooses.

584
00:49:54,982 --> 00:50:01,127
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also been a tremendous learning experience at a much smaller level.

585
00:50:02,023 --> 00:50:11,269
[SPEAKER_04]: for working with OPMs, working with contractors, the building process as it relates to how a new Medford High School will come about.

586
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:20,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, the amount of detail that we need to have focused on even very littlest things is really going to be critical.

587
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:25,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll just give an example, like alternates, right?

588
00:50:26,096 --> 00:50:37,825
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to make sure that if we're married to something, then there is no alternate, and be prepared to spend for that if it comes back at a higher price, or understand what the alternates are.

589
00:50:38,425 --> 00:50:41,788
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really nothing that's disappointing in the McGlynn playground.

590
00:50:41,828 --> 00:50:44,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just those types of alternates coming through.

591
00:50:46,488 --> 00:50:56,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it worth making a presentation on this to the MSBA building committee or not yet or, or, I mean, I know, I know, I know that she did the podcast.

592
00:50:56,993 --> 00:50:58,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

593
00:50:58,974 --> 00:50:59,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

594
00:50:59,635 --> 00:51:01,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I did see that she did that.

595
00:51:01,496 --> 00:51:02,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

596
00:51:02,176 --> 00:51:05,878
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, and I actually got to join the playground last week.

597
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:10,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was awesome.

598
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:13,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe I signed up for Thursday.

599
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:14,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

600
00:51:14,582 --> 00:51:15,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting for the official.
