1
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:06,101
Mike check one, two, check one, two, two.

2
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:26,759
Oh, Councilor Callahan, thank you, is going to be absent tonight, and everybody else is on Zoom?

3
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,161
You got us.

4
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:28,782
Great.

5
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:30,585
All right, then we'll begin.

6
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:31,700
There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permanent Committee, May 28th, 2025.

7
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,561
This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.

8
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:40,665
in the City Council Chambers, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. House Drive, Medford MA, and via Zoom.

9
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,806
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

10
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:44,247
Yes, Councilor Callahan is absent.

11
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:46,228
President Behrs?

12
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:47,588
Present.

13
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,590
Councilor Lemming?

14
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,599
Councilor Scarpelli?

15
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,520
Present.

16
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,101
Vice President Collins?

17
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:56,342
Present.

18
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,265
Four present, one absent.

19
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:01,666
The meeting is called to order.

20
00:16:01,686 --> 00:16:07,450
And I see that Councilor Lazaro is also present as a non-voting member of this committee.

21
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:11,337
Thank you all for being here tonight.

22
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:22,300
The agenda item for this night's planning and permitting committee meeting is paper number 24033, zoning ordinance updates for the Innis associates team, as usual.

23
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,982
This is the 26th zoning updates project meeting that we've held in this committee with Innis associates.

24
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:37,504
And this is the second of this committee meeting that we'll be spending on the other corridors proposal topic, as well as the

25
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:41,807
commercial nodes proposed topic.

26
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:48,511
Two weeks ago on May 14th, we had an initial planning and permitting committee on this topic.

27
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:51,514
We reviewed some preliminary maps for the other corridors.

28
00:16:52,955 --> 00:17:18,162
which we will go over in detail shortly, but just to refresh people's memories, that is High Street between West Medford and the border of Arlington, Boston Avenue, with the exception of the large part that is cordoned off for the Tufts Institutional Zone, Main Street and South Medford, Harvard Avenue and South Medford, and aligning the Broadway Corridor with the Medford and Somerville Broadway Corridor zoning study.

29
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:30,730
So tonight we are going to look at both of those topics again and review an updated proposal based on some feedback, questions, and comments that were raised two weeks ago.

30
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:38,854
Are there any questions or comments from my fellow councilors or from city staff before I turn it over to Paola from NS Associates?

31
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:46,317
Seeing none, I will turn it over to Paola.

32
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:07,568
Hello, everyone.

33
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,348
Good afternoon.

34
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:13,694
This is Paula Ramos Martinez, the Chief Resilience Officer from Innis Associates.

35
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:18,198
I'm here with Emily Innis, President at Innis Associates.

36
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:23,083
I will be guiding the presentation.

37
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,307
And just in a few seconds, I'm going to share it.

38
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,060
Perfect.

39
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:49,648
So as always, we will do the very fast introduction of what are we doing here in this rezoning process.

40
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,850
We will do a little bit of the timeline.

41
00:18:52,671 --> 00:19:03,120
Mainly what we are interested is in showing more that next meetings that are coming and just the bigger process timeline.

42
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:16,595
We will look at the analysis of previous versions of the other quarters, but mainly focusing on the updates, which are not too many from the last meeting.

43
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:20,459
We just have some sections that we would like to share with you.

44
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:34,756
And then we are looking a little bit deeper into neighborhood commercial and presenting ACU accessory commercial units and see if that's something that you're all interested in it.

45
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:38,194
So what are we doing here?

46
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:39,034
Very quickly.

47
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:43,116
We are coming after the met for comprehensive plan.

48
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:52,421
We're looking at the zoning areas and applying those and bringing those into the revision of your current zoning.

49
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:56,703
We're also looking into your climate action and adaptation plan.

50
00:19:58,023 --> 00:19:59,484
Um, this was done.

51
00:19:59,904 --> 00:20:01,164
What I'm showing here.

52
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:12,367
This map is the vision that came out of the met for comprehensive plan, and we're using the same geographical sections to do the rezoning and going a little bit back and forth.

53
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:24,611
Um, as you can see the there are the divisions of quarters squares, um, institutional anchors and then the residential from load into higher density.

54
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:36,213
It's very important for us to show people when they have the possibilities to give their comments and opinions on this process.

55
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:46,661
So, usually the process for any approval of any topic would go first to city council to the planning and permitting committee meetings, as we are doing today.

56
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:50,543
Last time we presented the new topic of other corridors.

57
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:58,149
Today, for example, is the second time that we come up after the planning committee meeting.

58
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:09,657
And then at some point, not today, but next time, we'll be referred to the city board whenever everybody, all the parties feel comfortable with the proposal.

59
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:22,824
And then on the city board you will also have the possibilities to comment on the proposal, the city bar board will vote on the topic, and then referred back to the city council.

60
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:28,948
When is presented to the city council with the recommendations, if any, from the city board.

61
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:36,491
people will also have the possibilities to comment and then it will be voted and that will be the final.

62
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:46,636
So we have all these four different steps and sometimes even more because there are several presentations on each of these moments.

63
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:57,741
So for example, right now, May 28th is the second time that we present the other quarters and the neighborhood notes.

64
00:21:58,721 --> 00:21:58,982
Um.

65
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:04,868
We are still talking about the residential districts in the city board.

66
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:15,059
And in June 4th, we're still discussing, but for now we have residential districts and the presentation of his squares and 80 years.

67
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:25,551
public questions, q amp a's, we have tomorrow, may 29 other quarters will be presented.

68
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:31,336
And then, June 9, we will be talking about parking and TDM process.

69
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:34,519
So here you can see the next meetings.

70
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:46,649
By chronological order, we would have the public meeting other quarters, the 29th so tomorrow at Tufts University Common Center.

71
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,771
We have city board.

72
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:50,372
The June 4.

73
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:53,555
public meeting on the 9th.

74
00:22:54,715 --> 00:22:58,318
That is to be determined still, but it's about the parking and TDMs.

75
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:08,045
And then we will look into the institutional district, Tufts University parking and TDM at the next planning and permitting committee meeting.

76
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:13,747
So today we are not presenting institutional district of university.

77
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:18,529
That was something that we had before, but we just couldn't have the time.

78
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:21,149
We need a little bit more time to bring that into a draft.

79
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,171
So it will come in the next planning and permitting committee meeting.

80
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:30,473
Okay, sorry.

81
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:36,935
So rectification, the ADU won't be presented on the city board on the June 4th.

82
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:41,692
So it will be residential districts and the squares.

83
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,119
So a little bit of what we've been doing.

84
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,641
This is the residential district's latest proposals.

85
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:58,945
This is all the residential neighborhoods without commercial corridors and squares.

86
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:10,092
This was the bigger proposal for the framework that we presented in March 12th for all the commercial mixed-use areas.

87
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:13,499
And this is the proposal together.

88
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:16,780
We're going to look into the other quarters.

89
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:26,625
And those are Boston Avenue, Main Street, Broadway, Harvard Street, and then only in Medford West area, High Street and Boston Avenue.

90
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:31,567
These are smaller scale type of quarters.

91
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,413
We also want to introduce.

92
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:42,283
Well, we have already introduced that, but we want to make sure that people know that there is available and interactive map.

93
00:24:42,944 --> 00:24:47,410
It's been updated regularly, so we the latest proposals.

94
00:24:49,873 --> 00:24:51,074
It's very easy to use.

95
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:52,694
You can look at the map layers.

96
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:53,634
There is the legend.

97
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:57,376
So there are the map layers, legend.

98
00:24:57,836 --> 00:24:59,597
There are some filter.

99
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:09,440
So if people wants to really look in depth into what is going on, they can have some filters and then to have a lot of the information.

100
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:18,283
If you click on each parcel, you would have that information of the existing lot dimensions, the zoning requirements that are currently in your zoning,

101
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,224
and the proposed changes.

102
00:25:22,905 --> 00:25:25,546
So this would be the it's on the presentation.

103
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:34,571
So if it's not shared already, whenever it's shared, you will have the QR code and also the link to to the interactive map.

104
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,203
So this I'm going to go a little fast we did last time.

105
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:45,171
But if anyone has any question I can come back to it.

106
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:47,995
This is your existing current zoning.

107
00:25:48,937 --> 00:25:51,701
We are focusing on the quarters as we talked about.

108
00:25:53,383 --> 00:26:07,197
And these are mainly the districts that are in your corridors commercial one apartment one industrial office to general residential and single family one.

109
00:26:08,685 --> 00:26:10,646
in the West Medford area.

110
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:17,291
So commercial one will allow residential building up to six stories by right.

111
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:21,633
And those are anywhere where you see that pinkish area.

112
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:26,596
You will have that I can zoom it in, maybe better.

113
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:27,277
Yeah, sorry.

114
00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:40,915
So where you have those pink areas what do you have by right by now is residential building up to six stories commercial buildings up to four stories, and then other permitted structures, up to 15 stories.

115
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:42,597
These all by right.

116
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,419
apartment one.

117
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:50,503
We have residential building up to three stories and then commercial buildings are not allowed.

118
00:26:50,924 --> 00:26:58,529
So for example, in Main Street, where we do have a lot of commercial area or commercial buildings, they wouldn't be allowed in your current.

119
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:00,531
They are not allowed in your current zoning.

120
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:10,078
Then it's industrial up to two stories by right office to up to six stories by right and then general residential

121
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:11,659
and single family.

122
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,385
General residential is single unit dwelling and two unit dwelling.

123
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:23,272
Right now, because of the new law for the ADUs, there will be the protected use ADU.

124
00:27:26,297 --> 00:27:33,662
Um, so our proposal, um, would be to have this, uh, districts implemented.

125
00:27:34,223 --> 00:27:38,986
So a lot of mixed use so that we allow for that commercial, uh, ground floor use.

126
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:50,495
Uh, so mixed use 1B, mixed use 2A, mixed use 2B, which it's really only, um, in the northern part of the

127
00:27:52,016 --> 00:27:55,901
towards Somerville on the Boston Avenue.

128
00:27:55,921 --> 00:28:04,653
Institutional district, this is the Tufts University district that we are working on as well.

129
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:08,618
And then urban residential too, that's all the red areas.

130
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:09,438
housing.

131
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:15,362
Um this the urban residential to allows for townhouse three unit dwelling multiplex.

132
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,603
This is in dwellings.

133
00:28:18,183 --> 00:28:21,986
Um sorry, buildings that allow for up to six units.

134
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:24,167
Multiple unit dwelling.

135
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:25,748
These are more than six units.

136
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:26,688
Um.

137
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,149
We allow

138
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:36,594
So mix use.

139
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:39,557
Let's go to the mix use districts mix use.

140
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,479
One B. This is the light blue.

141
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:57,611
We have in the northern part of Main Street in the narrower areas of Boston Avenue and in West Medford High Street.

142
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:02,054
high street area.

143
00:29:02,754 --> 00:29:07,357
And this is four stories by right, and it can be with incentives zoning.

144
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:19,624
And this to remind people, incentives zoning is when the developer negotiate, air quotes, negotiate with the city and the community, some benefits.

145
00:29:19,784 --> 00:29:24,667
And we have some, a table of benefits that could be done for the community.

146
00:29:25,108 --> 00:29:28,370
So if they do any of those, they can apply for

147
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,412
one story in the Mixius 1B.

148
00:29:33,932 --> 00:29:39,734
Mixius 2A, it would be five stories by right, plus two with incentive zoning.

149
00:29:39,774 --> 00:29:43,255
This will be up to seven, but by right is five.

150
00:29:43,835 --> 00:29:49,237
And Mixius 2B, it will be seven stories by right, plus two with incentive zoning.

151
00:29:49,897 --> 00:29:56,560
Very limited in the north part of the Boston Avenue towards Somerville.

152
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,821
I'm sorry, this will be easier.

153
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:05,984
So this is basically the how it was last time.

154
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:17,128
What we did by now was to bring a little bit of that section study or section analysis that we like to do just to check that those heights that we are

155
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:28,920
proposing are feasible and are respectful with the street and that is comfortable and intense enough.

156
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:34,165
And that is exist coexisting with what is there already.

157
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,609
So for example, this is in Main Street.

158
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:38,590
We

159
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:43,854
there is a very new apartment building.

160
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:48,538
And so we just kept it at this point is three stories.

161
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:52,581
It could go higher, but it's quite OK as it is.

162
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:59,365
But in front, we have a commercial building that at this moment is not allowed because it's not permitted by the current zoning.

163
00:31:00,186 --> 00:31:05,450
So in this way, we would permit this to have a ground floor commercial and then residential on top.

164
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,711
It can go up to four stories high.

165
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:24,620
Um, then a little bit, um, towards, uh, the... Sorry, what is the... This is Main Street with... This is the South Medford Fire Station.

166
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,362
Yeah, the fire station is in here.

167
00:31:28,242 --> 00:31:29,963
Yeah, this is Tufts Park, exactly.

168
00:31:30,384 --> 00:31:31,844
And then we have Main Street.

169
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:36,707
There are some parking area and then some buildings, commercial buildings.

170
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:49,136
So what we can do is really go quite high in here, because there is the park, and it's not actually bothering any neighbors, so we can really intensify this area.

171
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:57,942
We always propose, and so these are not projects or proposals, these are things that could happen with this new zoning.

172
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:01,264
It's not mandatory to follow any of this.

173
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:05,928
So we are just proposing what could potentially happen here.

174
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:16,813
And so we always advise to have commercial on the ground floor towards the activist street and parking on the back, in this case, towards the alley that is behind.

175
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:27,598
This is Main Street and Harvard Street, so that crossing where we have some commercial buildings.

176
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:32,861
There is not a lot of depth in this area, so going up

177
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:37,068
higher than four, it's a little bit complex.

178
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:45,929
They would need to do something with the parking or start combining a little bit with some other parcel to be able to go quite higher.

179
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:53,771
But at the moment, these ground floor are not permitted, so we want them to be permitted.

180
00:32:53,791 --> 00:33:00,732
I think in this specific area it is, and by right is six stories, so we are not really increasing a lot.

181
00:33:02,153 --> 00:33:10,921
But again, we propose always, if it's surface or built parking, that it's always up to the back of the lots.

182
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:15,625
And this is in Harvard Street and Yale Street.

183
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:21,851
This is a very big block that is for parking and multifamily.

184
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:23,613
I think these are like townhouses.

185
00:33:25,346 --> 00:33:45,612
And we're just proposing that it could have two ends to have to be built up to both the streets, residential only, and then to have two layers of parking if needed, but that it could be more densified if there is a structure parking in between.

186
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:49,593
It could be one layer if that is enough, or it could be up to two.

187
00:33:50,173 --> 00:33:53,834
We just want to bring different ways of dealing with parking.

188
00:33:55,014 --> 00:34:03,980
Sometimes being completely underground is very, very expensive to do in all New England area, but Medford as well.

189
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:10,665
So sometimes the suggestion is going just half under and then half up.

190
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:18,189
So that is not that expensive and that it can be, if it's one layer, it can be an access public space.

191
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:22,893
But yeah, so we're just trying to bring different options.

192
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:26,736
Boston Avenue, this is the very narrow area.

193
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:31,720
So here, again, dealing with parking, it's a little bit complex.

194
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:38,665
It would be advised to be more of a shared kind of parking with the buildings in this block.

195
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,449
Sorry, one second.

196
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:44,970
Okay.

197
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:58,027
And then here we have, and because it is as narrow, we have four stories and then one incentive zoning, which is quite okay in shadow study.

198
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:02,209
Okay, yeah, I had a problem then, sorry.

199
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,935
Yeah, the internet just kicked you off.

200
00:35:12,155 --> 00:35:12,355
Yes.

201
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:18,265
I can do the hotspot.

202
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:19,347
Maybe it works better.

203
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,853
Sorry, we're just pausing for technical difficulties.

204
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:25,435
Take your time, Paola.

205
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:03,178
She's in the waiting room of the Zoom.

206
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:19,864
OK.

207
00:36:19,924 --> 00:36:20,664
I think I'm back.

208
00:36:20,964 --> 00:36:22,184
I'm going to share again.

209
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:24,485
I'm going to send a request.

210
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:40,226
So, um, yeah, so we were talking.

211
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,248
Thank you.

212
00:36:41,308 --> 00:36:42,030
Sorry for that.

213
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:51,368
sometimes with a full screen mode, I get lost of what is going on.

214
00:36:51,848 --> 00:37:06,576
So here we have always existing and then under the proposed, here was in Boston Avenue because this area is quite narrow to feed parking and the building itself is a little bit complex or a little bit complicated.

215
00:37:06,696 --> 00:37:15,582
So here we have that mixed use 1B so that we have four by right and then the extra, one extra with incentive zoning.

216
00:37:18,023 --> 00:37:33,732
Then in the next block, because that depth is a lot wider, then we go up to mix use 2a, and so we can go up to 5 by right and then plus 2, so up to 7.

217
00:37:34,873 --> 00:37:42,617
Again, always try to activate the street and place the commercial up to the street and the parking behind.

218
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:59,948
So basically, the map was, we didn't hear any big remarks, any kind of big questions about what we presented last time.

219
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:06,252
So we just continue with that analysis of the main, of these other corridors.

220
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,715
I will start right now with neighborhood commercial notes.

221
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:14,518
So maybe it's better if we can comment on this one and then continue.

222
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:16,345
Yeah, I think that makes sense.

223
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:17,366
Thank you so much, Paola.

224
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:24,408
And for folks who weren't here two weeks ago, the proposed map that we're looking at is the same.

225
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:39,152
Augmenting our discussion this time are these new cross sections to help us understand just purely the height dimensionals on what is proposed under this draft proposal.

226
00:38:40,172 --> 00:38:42,073
I will go first to President Behrs.

227
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:44,568
Thank you.

228
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:47,310
Just two comments on this.

229
00:38:47,731 --> 00:39:06,130
One, on that Canal and Arlington area, I just think that the area that's bounded by Canal Street, Arlington, Boston M and the river, so not just the triangle area that's NR3, but also that other area,

230
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:10,838
Um, I think it's worth looking at that being at our start.

231
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:10,998
Yeah.

232
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,178
And our 3 as well.

233
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:14,019
Um, right there.

234
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:19,760
Yeah, just because again, the access issues, the river question and the recent.

235
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:23,121
Uh, less than recent now, but the fire.

236
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:26,622
Back there, it's just a really tough area.

237
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,923
Um, it shouldn't have been built out like that.

238
00:39:28,983 --> 00:39:30,883
So I think even the Boston parcels.

239
00:39:31,944 --> 00:39:33,224
We should look at, um.

240
00:39:35,013 --> 00:39:35,893
the district on that.

241
00:39:37,034 --> 00:39:38,235
So that's just one comment.

242
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:41,996
And the other one is just on PDDs.

243
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:47,099
I know we'll probably come back to that, but there are two PDDs in this district area.

244
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:52,401
So what's currently a UR2 at Waukling Court.

245
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:57,464
So this area right nestled up next to the train tracks around that makes use 2B.

246
00:39:57,544 --> 00:40:00,325
It's that the UR2 to the northeast of that.

247
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:04,307
That's a PDD a little bit to your right.

248
00:40:06,493 --> 00:40:08,895
a little further over by the Whole Foods, the other side of the river.

249
00:40:10,556 --> 00:40:17,662
Yeah, so that district there, that's with the big circle in the middle, that should be the PDD.

250
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:21,344
I can't remember which number PDD, but that should be one of the approved PDDs.

251
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:27,769
And then also 100 Winchester Street, which is way down towards the bottom of the map, right near Broadway.

252
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:32,153
We just need to make sure to include that PDD as well.

253
00:40:41,762 --> 00:40:42,843
So those are my two comments.

254
00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:43,443
Thank you.

255
00:40:45,764 --> 00:40:49,246
Thank you, President Behrs, for flagging those.

256
00:40:49,266 --> 00:41:02,333
Let's make sure to, when we get this draft, when we see the next version of this draft, thank you for the flag, we'll make sure that the PDDs are noted as what they are.

257
00:41:06,836 --> 00:41:07,496
Go ahead, Director Hahn.

258
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:15,312
I just wanted to sort of make something clear about how the PDDs work and the zoning.

259
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:29,740
So the planned development districts are overlays, so they have to have underlaying zoning, and they need to be exercised within two years of being approved in order for them to be used, or they need to be extended.

260
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,963
I believe Walkling Court and 100 Winchester, if they haven't

261
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:40,186
actually pulled building permits are very close to.

262
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:46,432
So they're intending to exercise those, but we still should have underlying zoning for the long term on that.

263
00:41:47,332 --> 00:41:48,593
Those are one and three.

264
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:52,797
PDD2 is on Mystic Ave, so it's not under discussion today.

265
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:58,102
But an example is that that one looks like it's going to expire without anybody pulling a building permit.

266
00:41:58,522 --> 00:42:02,366
And so then the zoning will revert back to the underlying zoning.

267
00:42:02,698 --> 00:42:06,040
which is now an updated new zoning that we did.

268
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:13,305
So I just wanted to sort of be clear, we should mark them on these maps, but we're not approving or adopting them as part of this process.

269
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:27,255
And we do need, I would say, I would argue coherent underlying zoning under it using the new terms, we shouldn't orphan a piece of like GR zone because it happens to have a PDD on it right now.

270
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:29,516
Great, thank you for that clarification.

271
00:42:29,536 --> 00:42:30,277
I think that's helpful.

272
00:42:31,107 --> 00:42:34,109
I totally forgot those were overlays of that base districts.

273
00:42:34,149 --> 00:42:35,810
Thank you for mentioning that.

274
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:39,253
Great, thank you.

275
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:49,339
So that just to put that another way, the PDDs are planned development districts, which are, I would say, specialized zoning.

276
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,320
Feel free to rephrase that.

277
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:57,405
City staff or planners, if that's inaccurate, that are negotiated with the development proponents.

278
00:42:59,006 --> 00:43:05,212
But through this process, when we are crafting underlying zoning for these districts, it's not that we want to fail to zone.

279
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:08,556
It's not that we want to omit the zone that has a PDD on it.

280
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:14,262
We should conceive about this as what we want to zone this as if a PDD did not exist, which it does.

281
00:43:15,323 --> 00:43:16,504
Do you have a direct response, Director Hunt?

282
00:43:18,082 --> 00:43:22,144
I just wanted to follow up on President Baird's other comment to make sure we were clear.

283
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,606
The area he was talking about is pretty small.

284
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:28,067
And so I'm wondering this one, Paula, how hard is it?

285
00:43:28,227 --> 00:43:29,628
Can you zoom in on that or not?

286
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:33,930
Sorry.

287
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:41,655
Because so what is currently there is suggested, I believe is, I don't even remember what the green is.

288
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,464
is you are, one, on the right side of the road as we're leaving the river and going towards West Medford.

289
00:43:48,964 --> 00:43:58,350
And then there's a very small mixed-use zone across the street there at the river, because that first floor is all mixed-use at the moment.

290
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,431
It's all commercial.

291
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:02,613
And so I just thought we should be clear

292
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:15,049
what change Councilor Behrs was asking for, or if this was reflecting it, because I think that green is actually the lowest scale we have anywhere on this map.

293
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:24,353
That could go to NR3, but that's facing Boston Ave and then across the street.

294
00:44:24,813 --> 00:44:29,115
I assume you're not suggesting that that commercial district shouldn't be?

295
00:44:29,235 --> 00:44:30,895
No, no, no.

296
00:44:30,975 --> 00:44:31,936
Yeah, so you see,

297
00:44:33,023 --> 00:44:49,390
I mean, my suggestion, for simplicity's sake and given the possibilities of what could happen, would be that those UR1s, you know, we have the, see that Canal Street kind of comes down and then merges with Arlington Street.

298
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:54,633
And everything we have between the tracks and canal and the river on the right side of that is NR3.

299
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:59,115
And then we have some of these weird parcels at the very end of Canal Street,

300
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:06,140
Um, that those, those definitely I don't think should be in the corridor and called.

301
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,341
And you are 1, I think those should align.

302
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:13,744
And honestly, I also think that, um, you know, it might be worth taking kind of what.

303
00:45:14,124 --> 00:45:16,545
For lack of a better term, this left triangle here.

304
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:21,006
The entire thing, including the Boston fronting parcels.

305
00:45:21,707 --> 00:45:26,789
And leave that in our 3 as well, um, because it's just a strange area and.

306
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:29,370
You know.

307
00:45:32,425 --> 00:45:42,413
Maybe the Boston Ave parcels from an access perspective are different, but just knowing some of the details of what happened around there, it's just a difficult area.

308
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:53,982
So maybe for simplicity's sake, everything within that triangle being an R3 would make sense, but certainly those two kind of back parcels that are more abutting on Canal than are abutting on Boston Ave,

309
00:45:54,608 --> 00:46:12,569
And then I think this stuff on Arlington that's technically in the residential district but is labeled you are one kind of at the, for lack of a better term like the north angle of that triangle that you have back, you have lots of budding in their backside on Canal Street.

310
00:46:15,687 --> 00:46:18,289
a little more careful about that whole area.

311
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,592
I'm not talking about anything on the other side of Boston Ave.

312
00:46:21,632 --> 00:46:24,775
That makes sense because of what's built there now.

313
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:26,957
Okay.

314
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:28,458
Thank you.

315
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:31,460
I just want to make sure we were only talking about that side as well.

316
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:33,742
Yeah, just that.

317
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:41,449
The good news is that that block of Arlington Street is getting some significant improvements this coming year and is going to get sidewalks.

318
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:43,067
That's great.

319
00:46:43,127 --> 00:46:45,788
It's a CDBG funded project.

320
00:46:46,668 --> 00:46:55,610
The biggest concern I have is with anything that is nearly abutting or directly abutting that strange part of Canal Street that's basically a very tiny dead end street.

321
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:57,030
Okay.

322
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:00,131
Great.

323
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:01,792
Thank you for that flag President Barras.

324
00:47:02,372 --> 00:47:03,572
Go next to Councilor Lemming.

325
00:47:05,378 --> 00:47:05,778
Thank you.

326
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:12,381
So I'm looking more at the areas along South Medford, like Harvard, Maine, Tufts Park.

327
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:18,264
With the current zoning, am I right?

328
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:21,086
It says, like, general residential and single family.

329
00:47:22,947 --> 00:47:32,431
Most of it is currently zoned that way, but with the exception of the small

330
00:47:34,178 --> 00:47:46,626
numbers of commercial one sort of along that Harvard main area, even though I'm pretty sure there are some like restaurants and other retail shops, particularly across from Tufts Park.

331
00:47:46,686 --> 00:47:53,571
So is there currently a like a one-story limit on pretty much all of the

332
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:56,826
general residential areas there right now.

333
00:47:57,006 --> 00:48:09,469
So are they, would they be able to build, like it just doesn't show anything currently about the height limits for along the residential area and the key, along general residential and the key there.

334
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:13,690
So every other place it says like six stories by right, two stories.

335
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:17,291
So I'm just wondering what the stories by right are and the

336
00:48:23,412 --> 00:48:36,558
That's part of the confusion of our current zoning is that if you have houses in the general residential there two and a half stories is by right where the half story is allows this like angle.

337
00:48:36,578 --> 00:48:42,721
The third story has to be half the size, the square footage of the floor below it.

338
00:48:44,242 --> 00:48:45,663
And the general residential

339
00:48:46,143 --> 00:48:49,465
does not currently allow any of the commercials and stuff.

340
00:48:49,965 --> 00:48:56,549
So where you have an area that allows, so if there was a commercial, it would, in theory, be taller.

341
00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:02,533
It's by use, the height, and not by zone in our current zoning.

342
00:49:03,053 --> 00:49:07,295
But general residential only allows single and two-family homes.

343
00:49:07,796 --> 00:49:10,757
So in effect, the height limit is 2.5 stories.

344
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:41,432
Okay, so probably my biggest, okay, so, and what you were saying earlier about the fact that the, I'm looking again at Harvard and Maine, it's just a very small sliver of it seems to be the commercial one, so four stories by right, but were you saying earlier that they're really not able to take advantage of it because it's such a small area?

345
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,565
So right now the commercial one as well.

346
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:51,606
It depends on the use.

347
00:49:51,826 --> 00:49:57,911
So residential can be up to six stories by right, and the commercial is four stories by right.

348
00:49:58,892 --> 00:50:08,360
Some of these lots are quite narrow, so it's not easy to fit the requirements for the parking that we have at the moment.

349
00:50:10,122 --> 00:50:12,143
So they usually go more than one

350
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:18,050
parcel deep so you could have several parcels put together and then go higher.

351
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:26,160
But at this moment, the parcels that are there, if we see at the sections we have one in that area.

352
00:50:29,364 --> 00:50:30,164
It's this one.

353
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:37,006
You don't have right now for those commercial, you don't have the parking in the lots.

354
00:50:37,386 --> 00:50:38,226
They are outside.

355
00:50:39,266 --> 00:50:47,048
And so to make something new, and I imagine that's why they are not six stories tall right now, is because you don't have where to put them.

356
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:53,450
So that needs to be reviewed, or we need to look into the parking.

357
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:58,011
But at this point, you would need to have at least two of those lots.

358
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:02,474
combined and then you can do something bigger, you can do something.

359
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:10,862
So you think it's more likely a developer will try to take advantage of the proposed zoning in that area since it is expanded than what they have currently?

360
00:51:11,392 --> 00:51:14,733
Yeah, we go a little bit further than what is there now.

361
00:51:14,993 --> 00:51:18,233
We go up to two or three, depending on the areas.

362
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:29,915
And also it's more regulating the, it doesn't matter the use, it's more about the heights are even.

363
00:51:29,995 --> 00:51:39,717
So you can have a mixed use building, you can have only residential, you can have, it's not that you have that six-story residential, four-story commercial, you can have those six.

364
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:45,725
And for the little lot in front of Tufts Park.

365
00:51:45,745 --> 00:51:49,568
So that's kind of one of my pet peeves of the city.

366
00:51:49,628 --> 00:51:55,913
I think that's pretty much one of the biggest pieces of lost potential that we have.

367
00:51:55,973 --> 00:52:00,256
It's such a nice area, but it just seems to be very underutilized.

368
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:23,761
Assuming the parking rules stay static, and given that there is a small parking lot right in front of that little lot there, how high would they be able to build under the proposed zoning, given the parking requirements that are there now and the amount of parking they currently have in front of the building?

369
00:52:25,702 --> 00:52:29,603
That was kind of a math problem, but... You have very few.

370
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:37,183
right now in there to be able to, it really depends from project to project.

371
00:52:37,203 --> 00:52:46,716
It's very difficult without seeing the building or the square footage, how much you can do, but you don't have a lot in that piece of land.

372
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:58,203
So surface parking take a lot of space and then the urban environment that has been the vibrancy of the area, it's not very good.

373
00:52:59,204 --> 00:53:04,887
So that's why we try to push all the parkings always towards the back and put the commercial in front.

374
00:53:06,168 --> 00:53:09,370
You can get very high with only that parking that I can tell.

375
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,772
What I'm getting is, I just really want that parcel to change.

376
00:53:12,812 --> 00:53:18,536
I just really want somebody to actually make something cool there and be super incentivized to do that.

377
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:23,320
But I guess a lot of that will come up when we review the parking next month.

378
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:27,483
OK.

379
00:53:27,683 --> 00:53:27,903
OK.

380
00:53:29,784 --> 00:53:38,411
It's just an interesting little area because it's just because of the mix of commercial uses and residential uses.

381
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,717
Yeah, no, that's all the questions I have on it for now.

382
00:53:43,797 --> 00:53:44,077
Thank you.

383
00:53:45,417 --> 00:53:46,258
Thank you, Councilor Lemmon.

384
00:53:46,278 --> 00:53:47,378
We'll go back to President Behrs.

385
00:53:48,919 --> 00:53:49,279
Thanks.

386
00:53:49,319 --> 00:54:03,805
Just to Councilor Lemmon's point, I think that area, there's a lot of strange mix of commercial and industrial in that area where Codding Ave is and on that block.

387
00:54:04,586 --> 00:54:07,967
Director Hunt can correct me if I'm wrong, but looking at the

388
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:16,703
just looking at the interactive map, I believe that's a city owned parking lot.

389
00:54:17,084 --> 00:54:19,586
And I think it was, it used to be different.

390
00:54:19,786 --> 00:54:27,433
It was changed when the orientation of the streets were changed there to create the right angle intersection.

391
00:54:29,395 --> 00:54:36,261
And I think, you know, that would be a really interesting opportunity for a public private partnership.

392
00:54:38,727 --> 00:54:52,391
to adjust and change kind of that whole block potentially, given that so much of it is just underutilized, you know, empty lots or single story commercial.

393
00:54:54,092 --> 00:55:03,335
And I think in general just talking about especially the Main Street area, the zoning, it's one of the places where the existing zoning

394
00:55:04,498 --> 00:55:08,401
is really not reflective of the built environment in so many ways.

395
00:55:08,461 --> 00:55:28,977
There's so much functionally mixed use, you know, structures and uses all up and down Main Street and Medford Street, where you have these, you know, two or three-story buildings and some even very tall three-story buildings that have large, you know, floor heights.

396
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:36,428
that are completely made non-conforming by the zoning that was passed after they were built.

397
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:49,639
So I think it's a good opportunity with this zoning to change and get the zoning back to what is actually there and hopefully some more as well.

398
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:54,563
So I see that area as a particular area of potential improvement.

399
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:10,384
So Madam Chair, if I might, as we're looking at that, you're correct, President Behrs, that parking lot is a new public lot that was created because people were parking literally in the middle of the intersection.

400
00:56:10,904 --> 00:56:13,805
Like literally people were just making their own parking spots in the middle.

401
00:56:13,845 --> 00:56:17,327
I think the city striped it at one point, but we

402
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:22,990
created a parking lot to sort of meet the need and make it a much safer situation.

403
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:29,234
One of the things that I know when I look on our, so it is public record on the assessor's database.

404
00:56:29,674 --> 00:56:46,125
So the interactive map we made for zoning, we actually chose not to put ownership in there in order to kind of help with some privacy issues, but anybody can go to our assessor's webpage on the city's website and click on the assessor's database, and there's a map version called Access GIS.

405
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:54,190
And you could actually see that in this section, so there's Main Street and the road behind it is Cotting Avenue.

406
00:56:54,911 --> 00:57:02,537
And there are several parcels where the same person owns the parcel on Main Street and the parcel on Cotting Ave.

407
00:57:03,497 --> 00:57:05,599
And so there's a lot of back to back here.

408
00:57:05,999 --> 00:57:10,322
So there really is some opportunity for somebody to do a larger building.

409
00:57:11,483 --> 00:57:15,885
They could very easily be adding parking on the Cotting Ave side of this.

410
00:57:15,986 --> 00:57:20,068
And in fact, right behind them on Cotting Ave is an electrical transformer.

411
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:23,751
So they're not even looking right at a neighbor, the first couple parcels.

412
00:57:28,424 --> 00:57:33,427
So there is some space there for them to do something where they might have parking.

413
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:54,698
One of the things that I have been noting, and I will also mention, is that right now in our parking, if you are near high frequency transit, and I'm not going to say off the cuff whether or not this has that much bus service, it might in the future, it might now, you only need 0.8 spots per unit.

414
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:57,199
And if a person

415
00:57:57,739 --> 00:58:06,203
brings forth a proposal and sort of makes an argument for why they should be allowed to have less, it's a special permit by the Community Development Board.

416
00:58:07,203 --> 00:58:19,068
So if one was to say, we don't need additional parking for our commercial units on the ground floor because you have public parking right in front of us, therefore we only need parking for the residential units,

417
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,761
Right now, I personally would look at that as a good argument.

418
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:36,084
So there is some space here, and this is actually an area where the zoning, I think, there's a lot of potential for change, especially how the ownership is currently structured of these parcels.

419
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:44,727
And I'll say, I have no idea who the people are who own them, just that I'm noting it's the same entity, the front parcels and the back parcels.

420
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:51,065
Great.

421
00:58:51,385 --> 00:58:52,086
Thank you, Director Hunt.

422
00:58:52,126 --> 00:58:52,826
I think that's helpful.

423
00:58:53,787 --> 00:59:11,920
And I think one of the themes that I'm hearing coming up in the last couple of comments especially is as it relates to the goal of this proposal and certainly not this proposal alone in this comprehensive zoning review process, part of the goal here is to incentivize and allow

424
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:20,906
what we would like to see developed in the city, which maybe is not possible or not incentivized to develop under our current zoning and current conditions.

425
00:59:22,287 --> 00:59:29,011
But also to reduce nonconformity is where the current built environment conflicts with our existing zoning.

426
00:59:29,051 --> 00:59:32,913
And I think that's I think that's an important part of the conversation.

427
00:59:32,953 --> 00:59:37,216
I think an important part of the conversation is what Councilor Lemming and President Behrs recently brought up, which is

428
00:59:37,996 --> 00:59:54,799
kind of around how the current or proposed zoning interacts with these various conditional requirements, dimensional requirements, which, to the example of, you know, how many stories can a single family have in a GR district under current zoning?

429
00:59:54,859 --> 01:00:07,222
Like, well, two and a half, but what actually gets constructed depends on the dimensions of that lot and quite a lot of other factors as it would for any other lot.

430
01:00:08,385 --> 01:00:13,488
which get run through a calculation, and that's how the zoning is enforced by the building commissioner.

431
01:00:13,808 --> 01:00:18,110
The same will be true under any new zoning and all zoning.

432
01:00:19,471 --> 01:00:34,199
But I think that's an important thing to flag and to continue to flag as we talk about the zoning proposals is comparing them to what we currently have, and also acknowledging that it's not just the maximum allowed uses, the maximum allowed heights, but looking at those lot sizes.

433
01:00:37,602 --> 01:00:44,008
and other very present conditions and thinking, okay, what's likely to happen here and what's likely to happen, but only if a lot is combined, for example.

434
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:50,454
So I just wanted to underline that while we were on the topic.

435
01:00:53,677 --> 01:00:59,123
We'll look for other comments from councilors on this proposal at this stage.

436
01:01:00,818 --> 01:01:01,999
Seeing none, I'll jump in.

437
01:01:02,999 --> 01:01:07,262
Like we said, the draft map is not very different from what we looked at two weeks ago.

438
01:01:07,282 --> 01:01:10,464
I thought that two weeks ago, this was off to a really great start.

439
01:01:10,544 --> 01:01:14,246
I still feel good about this map as setting forth that

440
01:01:16,644 --> 01:01:20,750
you know, that essentially that vision for this is what we are comfortable being allowed in these places.

441
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:26,719
I like that this would reduce nonconformities in a lot of spaces, particularly in South Medford.

442
01:01:26,779 --> 01:01:30,805
I think that this offers a vision

443
01:01:32,186 --> 01:01:39,452
for allowing the type of uses that I think we know residents and business owners in Medford would like to see in a lot of these places.

444
01:01:39,472 --> 01:01:51,922
I kind of can't help but look especially closely at South Medford because this corridor proposal includes the area that's directly around where I live and where I spend a lot of my time.

445
01:01:52,042 --> 01:02:00,348
I think it's really appropriate to focus on these corridors in South Medford and the other corridors in this proposal as ones to

446
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:15,269
both give a signal that we're looking for higher intensity residential uses here and give a signal that we're looking for mixed uses here because I think we know that people already want that.

447
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:17,831
And I think there's some places where we're starting to see those growing organically.

448
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:28,615
It'd be nice to make it easier for small businesses to grow up alongside some of our busiest residential districts and just make it easier for us to continue to see that flourish.

449
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:39,299
Well, I see no other hands on this proposal, so maybe we can proceed along to an overview.

450
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:42,641
Or sorry, we can revisit the commercial nodes topic.

451
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:46,482
Unless there's any other comments from city staff, city councilors.

452
01:02:49,544 --> 01:02:52,165
All right, you can proceed with the presentation then, Paola.

453
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:52,385
Thank you.

454
01:02:59,967 --> 01:03:00,307
Perfect.

455
01:03:00,747 --> 01:03:03,048
Thank you, everyone, for your comments.

456
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:07,010
So we presented this last time.

457
01:03:08,111 --> 01:03:21,997
We just went a little bit further in our analysis, and especially where we could or what are we considering to localize these commercial notes.

458
01:03:23,878 --> 01:03:28,964
So we talked about how could we define this in the zoning?

459
01:03:29,785 --> 01:03:34,710
We talked about overlay district and to be site specific.

460
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:39,675
I just want to remember what are these commercial nodes.

461
01:03:41,697 --> 01:03:44,939
They are also called commercial and neighborhood hubs.

462
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:52,363
And these are gathering places where residents have easy access to goods and services close to their homes.

463
01:03:53,404 --> 01:04:00,968
These are mainly for small businesses that will serve and will be located near or within residential areas.

464
01:04:02,229 --> 01:04:09,375
This business could include, among others, convenience stores, coffee shops, dry cleaners, drug stores, barber shops, and beauty salons.

465
01:04:09,495 --> 01:04:13,839
We have now a proposal of what those uses could be a little bit more in depth.

466
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:25,410
This type of development could increase the convenience for residents to reduce the need for parking areas and help create vibrant and walkable neighborhoods.

467
01:04:26,891 --> 01:04:35,337
neighborhood commercial zoning plays an essential role in meeting the everyday needs of residents while preserving the character of the community.

468
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:53,852
So what uses will be considering for this neighborhood commercial notes and especially it's important to have in mind that these are going to be always small business so that we will have always a cap on the maximum surface.

469
01:04:54,993 --> 01:05:10,604
So we're talking about co working space, neighborhood cafe, neighborhood grocery shops, neighborhood convenience shop, dry cleaners and laundromats, personal services like hairdressers, neighborhood retail shop.

470
01:05:10,864 --> 01:05:20,632
This is more to be determined exactly what retail uses we're talking about a little bit more specific and youth centers.

471
01:05:21,192 --> 01:05:31,337
So we are usually looking at 2,000 square foot or 2,500 square foot, a little bit maybe more per grocery store.

472
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:45,183
But usually the idea is to have very small footprint, very small buildings that could provide a very mixed of services.

473
01:05:48,267 --> 01:05:53,531
So we found this is a map where we locate all the existing.

474
01:05:55,962 --> 01:05:56,662
we're looking at.

475
01:05:56,982 --> 01:06:00,003
Um commercial uses in the residential areas.

476
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:02,023
It's not exactly the.

477
01:06:02,864 --> 01:06:05,044
Commercial neighborhood notes right now.

478
01:06:05,204 --> 01:06:08,005
But um, where do we have these uses?

479
01:06:08,705 --> 01:06:11,866
Um and where are located in order to help us to build.

480
01:06:12,706 --> 01:06:18,247
Um also ourselves the where these overlaid site specific

481
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:33,232
What are the principles that we will follow to determine what are these new places or what those could be.

482
01:06:33,893 --> 01:06:39,195
So we did a strategy, we have a required minimum restrictions.

483
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:47,559
So we use GIS to build a map from this having from lower to higher priority areas.

484
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:56,397
that will help us choose where this specifically could be.

485
01:06:57,338 --> 01:07:05,365
So the required minimum restrictions would be that it's only in residential districts and that it has to be a distance from any corridors and squares.

486
01:07:06,486 --> 01:07:13,775
And this is because we want to provide service for the neighborhood, for the residential areas.

487
01:07:14,516 --> 01:07:20,563
And if they are close to any corridor or square, they can find the services in these corridors or squares.

488
01:07:21,224 --> 01:07:25,810
So those are the minimum requirements that we have in all the areas.

489
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:32,317
And then we have some additional requirements that will help us build that high priority less priority.

490
01:07:32,918 --> 01:07:39,947
So we chose to have to have them be in close to an open space recreation, it can be a park sports riverfront.

491
01:07:43,229 --> 01:07:45,372
We are still defining this distances.

492
01:07:46,674 --> 01:07:59,931
So, in the map we did quarter of a mile so if it's less than quarter of a mile or if it's higher than that close to municipal building that is a library community center or school.

493
01:08:00,611 --> 01:08:06,732
close to a medical facility, and then prioritize higher interconnected streets.

494
01:08:06,812 --> 01:08:17,695
And these are the streets that are connected to other streets so that we don't end up having these kind of nodes in dead-end streets.

495
01:08:17,775 --> 01:08:22,036
So higher interconnected streets, it's also a priority.

496
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:30,188
And so you can see here all the different maps that we built, all these different requirements.

497
01:08:30,808 --> 01:08:37,450
And here on the right, we have those where is more suitable to have these nodes.

498
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:41,291
Now, it doesn't mean that all of them are going to be in the same area.

499
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,271
We will look into neighborhood by neighborhood where that is.

500
01:08:46,052 --> 01:08:51,933
So we can look up to Lawrence Street, Lawrence States would be one area.

501
01:08:53,193 --> 01:08:56,835
maybe we have two or three different nodes.

502
01:08:58,056 --> 01:09:01,357
North Medford, we might have two nodes.

503
01:09:02,118 --> 01:09:08,441
We have to also look into the existing and see where those existing already naturally occurring areas.

504
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:13,463
And if they fit these studies, I know already that some do.

505
01:09:14,504 --> 01:09:21,848
And then we will look at Glenwood and et cetera, other areas where we could have those.

506
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,771
Um so this is where we are right now.

507
01:09:25,111 --> 01:09:27,374
Um With the commercial notes.

508
01:09:28,435 --> 01:09:34,562
And we are bringing also by request of the city staff and something that we, uh.

509
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:41,830
Also think it's interesting for this area, so we can discuss if this can be located somewhere else.

510
01:09:42,931 --> 01:09:46,754
We are bringing the idea of accessory commercial units.

511
01:09:46,774 --> 01:09:50,377
So we all know about accessory dwelling units.

512
01:09:50,777 --> 01:09:57,342
So this is very similar, but instead of the use of a dwelling, that would be the use for commercial.

513
01:09:58,163 --> 01:10:08,471
And so what we tried is to provide a space for individuals to build their businesses within their homes or on their property on which they live.

514
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:09,432
the city of Pittsburgh.

515
01:10:09,452 --> 01:10:13,796
This provides transition from home based business to off site business.

516
01:10:14,657 --> 01:10:18,721
So the uses that could be in here, but we could study.

517
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,524
This is from a proposal that we did for the city of

518
01:10:26,008 --> 01:10:43,146
We had sale of food grown or prepared and package on the premises, coffee hot chocolate baked goods ice cream prepared dinners, take out foods for neighborhood based consumption, art or music, music lessons, personal services hair salon barbershop tailoring,

519
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:44,626
Shoe repair is similar.

520
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:47,507
Picture framing and small repairs are similar.

521
01:10:48,727 --> 01:10:50,828
Automobile repairs are prohibited.

522
01:10:50,848 --> 01:10:53,469
It's not for these commercial units.

523
01:10:54,549 --> 01:10:58,950
Retail of art supplies, books, records, musical instruments are similar.

524
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:06,992
Retail of non-food products made on the premises, such as clothing, jewelry, wigs, accessories, household goods are similar.

525
01:11:07,732 --> 01:11:15,235
So you can see that a lot of these uses goes very well with the uses that we propose for the commercial nodes.

526
01:11:17,736 --> 01:11:21,058
So these again as well can be attached or detached.

527
01:11:22,398 --> 01:11:31,922
They can include an addition or attached to garage provided that these building meet always the building codes for habitable space.

528
01:11:34,024 --> 01:11:37,351
These are different from a home occupation or live work.

529
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:40,959
These are more intense or they tend to be more intense.

530
01:11:45,362 --> 01:11:59,031
This is the idea, at least in the city of Pittsville for the study that we did was about a commercial incubator process where you start with a home occupation life work so that you have a home based business.

531
01:12:00,512 --> 01:12:04,275
Then your next step will be that accessory commercial unit so whatever your.

532
01:12:06,256 --> 01:12:17,541
doing and preparing on your home, you can sell it on this accessory commercial unit, or it can be a bigger kitchen or a bigger, more specific for what you need.

533
01:12:18,902 --> 01:12:20,323
And then the step three will be

534
01:12:20,923 --> 01:12:27,027
on that commercial building in a quarter, or then in this case was downtown Pittsfield.

535
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,788
And this can be, for example, Mystic Avenue.

536
01:12:29,909 --> 01:12:30,829
So it depends.

537
01:12:30,909 --> 01:12:35,412
It was a process to build up towards that end.

538
01:12:36,072 --> 01:12:37,253
And it's not mandatory.

539
01:12:37,273 --> 01:12:40,735
You can obviously stay in any of the steps.

540
01:12:41,636 --> 01:12:44,577
But it was to give more flexibility and to be easier.

541
01:12:45,878 --> 01:12:53,320
And so as any other requirement or any other zoning, we also had the dimensional standards.

542
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:58,821
In this case, the lot size was 5,000, lot width 50.

543
01:13:00,061 --> 01:13:07,523
The size would be 40% of the footprint of the principal building or 1,000 square feet, whatever was more restricted.

544
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:14,965
Parking in this case was maximum two parking that could be provided on site or in a neighborhood parking lot.

545
01:13:15,365 --> 01:13:17,266
within 500 feet of the lot.

546
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:27,428
This, for example, we had also designed different neighborhood parkings and different sizes so that it could be integrated in the residential neighborhood.

547
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:35,091
And then we have other additional requirements depending if they were attached or detached.

548
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:42,893
The idea is to bring this more up to the front of the street so that it has easy access

549
01:13:43,994 --> 01:13:47,501
And these weren't on every part of the residential districts.

550
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:50,326
These are always site specific.

551
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:53,792
These were for certain streets that could have this.

552
01:13:57,072 --> 01:14:07,658
And so, yeah, for example, the additional requirements, if it was a detached ACU, we had a height, I think it was 15 foot.

553
01:14:08,138 --> 01:14:12,561
The distance from principal building were 10 foot minimum.

554
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:16,723
The front setback was three from the front lot line.

555
01:14:17,164 --> 01:14:23,587
But if there was any kind of outdoor display or to encourage outdoor seating, it could go up to 20 feet.

556
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:39,814
and then side setback was following the district requirement and the rear setback was the line of the rear facade of the principal building so that it didn't went to on that private garden that usually is on the back of the building.

557
01:14:41,755 --> 01:14:50,098
So these are the different requirements and we thought it could be interesting for our neighborhood notes to bring this ACU concept.

558
01:14:51,499 --> 01:14:53,080
And it's up to here.

559
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:53,940
Thank you very much.

560
01:14:57,846 --> 01:15:04,811
Thank you so much for that presentation, Paola and counselors and some members of the public who are here two weeks ago.

561
01:15:04,851 --> 01:15:17,960
Remember that we got an overview of the concept of the neighborhood commercial nodes previously, and we talked about kind of what they're for and where they should go to really be the most effective.

562
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:22,283
And we touched on the topic of accessory commercial units.

563
01:15:22,883 --> 01:15:26,145
But I appreciate this greater in-depth analysis of both

564
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:43,558
It's exciting to see the suitability analysis for the commercial nodes and to get a little bit deeper on some of the thought process behind the ACUs, not to be confused with ADUs, and how those might be structured dimensionally.

565
01:15:45,879 --> 01:15:50,662
Last time we talked quite a bit about, and you talked about this in your presentation, different ways of

566
01:15:52,668 --> 01:15:56,551
structuring or enabling the neighborhood commercial nodes within our zoning code.

567
01:15:56,571 --> 01:16:00,054
We talked about a base district.

568
01:16:00,174 --> 01:16:04,498
We talked about an overlay strategy as to kind of different roads we could go down.

569
01:16:04,538 --> 01:16:17,289
It seemed to me by the end of our meeting two weeks ago that most councilors were leaning towards a site-specific overlay, and I think your presentation speaks to this, is we do want to make sure the whole point of the neighborhood commercial nodes is a topic.

570
01:16:18,309 --> 01:16:43,563
is to make sure that the residential, the squarely residential areas of the city, not the ones that are in the corridors proposals, not the ones that are in the larger standalone corridors, not the ones that are in the squares, that these residences that are really bounded and bordered by other residences still have access to amenities and small businesses that would be useful to them and serve a true neighborhood purpose.

571
01:16:43,803 --> 01:16:45,704
So I'm not trying to incentivize

572
01:16:47,245 --> 01:17:02,561
necessarily, you know, super splashy, unique businesses that people would, you know, drive to or be specific, highly unique destinations, but things would be really useful in the fabric of a neighborhood and dimensioned accordingly.

573
01:17:02,581 --> 01:17:06,144
And I think we saw for the first time tonight, some of the

574
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:15,649
a little bit of a deeper view at the required minimum restrictions and additional requirements on the neighborhood commercial nodes.

575
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:17,350
So I just wanted to return to that very quickly.

576
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:29,574
I think that that helps to make concrete what we're talking about, about where we want to focus these and how we could bring that about through these site-specific overlay in specific places.

577
01:17:31,295 --> 01:17:36,096
So as you mentioned, these are only for residential districts because mixed-use districts already got the mixed uses.

578
01:17:38,397 --> 01:17:45,960
Could you speak just a little bit for folks who may be watching this presentation who don't spend all of their time thinking about the city blocks?

579
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:56,664
When we say we're thinking about different minimum distances from corridors and squares, 800 feet to 1,200 feet, we're talking about probably like a minimum of three to five blocks away from a major commercial area?

580
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,025
Or how do you conceptualize that?

581
01:18:06,312 --> 01:18:08,097
Yeah, that's about right three to four.

582
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:10,142
Okay, great.

583
01:18:10,222 --> 01:18:10,583
Thank you.

584
01:18:11,064 --> 01:18:13,550
And then we're talking about those additional requirements.

585
01:18:20,693 --> 01:18:20,933
Sorry.

586
01:18:21,674 --> 01:18:22,374
My brain just glitched.

587
01:18:22,394 --> 01:18:23,515
I was trying to put this into words.

588
01:18:24,295 --> 01:18:31,580
Additional requirements of proximity to certain community uses, open space, parks, community centers, and I noted you said hospital or medical facility as well.

589
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:42,326
If my understanding is correct, this is just to make sure that we're putting, again, small businesses close to where people will already be and they might need something where they're at that space.

590
01:18:44,408 --> 01:18:48,635
How does the higher priority mechanism work or how would that work in the context of the zoning?

591
01:18:48,675 --> 01:18:52,101
Is that more of a guideline or sort of a way of stating a preference?

592
01:18:55,618 --> 01:18:58,780
Yeah, so maybe I needed to be a little bit more clear on that.

593
01:18:59,421 --> 01:19:03,984
So right now we are still studying where those areas will be.

594
01:19:04,505 --> 01:19:06,686
We will give precise locations.

595
01:19:07,767 --> 01:19:23,959
Right now this is, we built this map and these requirements or principles in order to check with all of you that you think that these are good principles or if there are any others that you think we should also consider.

596
01:19:24,579 --> 01:19:25,560
and added to this.

597
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:33,006
So how it works is that we have the two the residential districts and the distances from the quarters.

598
01:19:33,446 --> 01:19:38,530
Those are giving us the base map and the other four are building on each other.

599
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:41,153
So we have two or three of those.

600
01:19:41,593 --> 01:19:43,935
Then we have like that higher priority.

601
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:59,077
say we have higher street connections and closer to a park and there is some close by also a civic institution or a medical office, then we will see that that high priority would go into that darker reddish color.

602
01:20:00,138 --> 01:20:08,585
Um, so that is mainly to help us to pinpoint later and be and bring in the next draft a more precise location.

603
01:20:08,605 --> 01:20:12,108
Um, and we will look into all the different neighborhoods.

604
01:20:12,749 --> 01:20:14,971
Um, where we could have those.

605
01:20:15,591 --> 01:20:22,036
So this is very helpful to look into which areas have those, um Requirements.

606
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:23,598
I see.

607
01:20:23,638 --> 01:20:23,978
Thank you.

608
01:20:24,178 --> 01:20:25,419
That was my misunderstanding.

609
01:20:25,879 --> 01:20:30,002
That was some sort of dimensional requirement as opposed to just a factor.

610
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:33,364
And as we're putting the suitability analysis together, thank you for explaining that.

611
01:20:36,306 --> 01:20:45,892
Any questions or comments from my fellow counselors on the accessory commercial units or other parts of the proposed commercial neighborhood notes?

612
01:20:53,944 --> 01:20:54,545
Seeing none.

613
01:20:56,166 --> 01:21:06,733
So in terms of our, working backwards, in terms of our next steps for these two proposals that we spent our time on tonight, I know the, oh, I'll hold on that.

614
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,174
President Beers has raised his hand.

615
01:21:08,254 --> 01:21:08,975
Go ahead, President Beers.

616
01:21:10,035 --> 01:21:11,576
Sorry about that, I had a mouse issue.

617
01:21:11,937 --> 01:21:13,958
My computer mouse, I should say.

618
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:19,922
I just had one,

619
01:21:22,426 --> 01:21:24,467
I guess it's kind of going to what Kit was saying.

620
01:21:24,587 --> 01:21:36,855
So on these commercial nodes and then the ACUs and how they interrelate is the next step for us to discuss this at a future meeting and look at kind of a more specific proposal for the site-specific overlay.

621
01:21:43,513 --> 01:21:47,214
Yes, so we just want to make sure that you're part of the process.

622
01:21:48,454 --> 01:22:00,758
And then in the next draft, we will bring all these different ingredients and specific areas in a proposal more specific and precise.

623
01:22:01,638 --> 01:22:16,648
But we wanted to show and start talking about what the ACU are, what is the intention, what are the uses, and what are these principles that we are looking in order to locate these notes.

624
01:22:18,189 --> 01:22:18,489
Great.

625
01:22:18,989 --> 01:22:19,750
I appreciate that.

626
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:27,474
And I just want to put out there maybe it might be worth taking a little bit of extra time on this one.

627
01:22:27,514 --> 01:22:29,456
Not so much extra time as in more thought,

628
01:22:30,908 --> 01:22:52,816
I think we've gotten a lot of good work up to this point, and maybe putting a pin in this specific thing for a month or maybe after June 30, just given how much else we're working on, I think might be something we should consider.

629
01:22:52,836 --> 01:22:54,037
So I just wanted to put that out there.

630
01:23:00,535 --> 01:23:00,835
Thank you.

631
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:10,480
I think there's also probably value in the neighborhood residential proposal still being going through the process and not officially ordained.

632
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:18,485
And this, of course, proposal for the accessory, sorry, for the neighborhood commercial nodes we're developing in the context of that.

633
01:23:18,525 --> 01:23:26,269
So I think that this is one that we can pace accordingly with that being finalized.

634
01:23:26,289 --> 01:23:28,090
Go to Councilor Lemming.

635
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,683
I just like to say to express, I think it's a really cool idea.

636
01:23:33,703 --> 01:23:42,550
I'd like to move forward on it, however feasibly we can do so.

637
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:55,140
I mean, the idea of having a locally owned bakery in the middle of Lawrence Estates, which is kind of,

638
01:23:55,915 --> 01:24:03,123
far from, which is relatively far from other commercial areas, I think would be pretty cool.

639
01:24:03,504 --> 01:24:15,498
Would the ACU proposal sort of be its own package that in itself would go through the CDB and council as like its own thing, or would it be sort of attached to something else?

640
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:22,514
Yeah, it could go either way.

641
01:24:22,534 --> 01:24:25,035
We could have it with a package with the commercial nodes.

642
01:24:25,735 --> 01:24:31,677
It could be that it could also be expanded to other areas that we would be interested and go as a separate.

643
01:24:31,937 --> 01:24:32,637
It could go either way.

644
01:24:34,998 --> 01:24:42,460
Yeah, I personally would like to see it attached to something else just to simplify things.

645
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:48,281
I feel like there's already a lot of packages that the CDB is sort of dealing with right now.

646
01:24:48,502 --> 01:24:49,982
So that's just my take, though.

647
01:24:53,044 --> 01:24:54,865
Thank you, Councilwoman.

648
01:24:55,706 --> 01:25:03,592
Certainly, I think that the accessory commercial units and the neighborhood commercial nodes kind of thematically go together.

649
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:13,260
I also think the CDB has been pretty good about taking everything we've been sending their way and going through it at the pace that they need to.

650
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:16,442
So I feel comfortable leaving that.

651
01:25:18,103 --> 01:25:22,007
If it shakes out that we report both out on the same timeline, I think that's great.

652
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:23,808
And I think that topically makes sense.

653
01:25:23,828 --> 01:25:24,349
They go together.

654
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:33,357
But I think that... Happy to leave the pace of the CDB up to the CDB.

655
01:25:39,382 --> 01:25:43,486
Seeing no further comments from my fellow councillors right now, so...

656
01:25:46,318 --> 01:25:51,862
President Behr segwayed me into just touching on our next steps for all of these topics.

657
01:25:52,082 --> 01:25:59,446
So for accessory commercial units and for the neighborhood commercial nodes, I think we have a really excellent start here.

658
01:25:59,466 --> 01:26:02,768
I'm also very excited to see this continue to move forward.

659
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:06,431
I think this is also a thing, a topic that a lot of folks in the community

660
01:26:07,171 --> 01:26:09,092
Um, we'll be excited about.

661
01:26:09,112 --> 01:26:22,076
I think this is just you know, we're talking about what's the right type of amenity that would be most useful to you and your residential neighborhood, and I think that's the type of thing that people just Talk about in various language just in the course of their, you know.

662
01:26:23,156 --> 01:26:30,599
Daily daily lives and daily weeks like I wish we had a X right here, and I think this is proposing one solution to that kind of thought.

663
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:31,599
So that's very exciting.

664
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:32,840
Um

665
01:26:34,401 --> 01:26:36,542
So this will continue to be iterated on.

666
01:26:36,582 --> 01:26:41,266
I know you guys have some study and analysis into this that is still in the works.

667
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:45,189
We have several other proposals that we are working on that are in the queue.

668
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:59,519
And I think I agree with President Behrs that this, if it takes a little more time for this one to become a fully finalized and reportable package, I think that's fine.

669
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:10,560
And again, I think it makes sense to see how the residential proposal shakes out and then finalize this accordingly because they matter to each other.

670
01:27:13,527 --> 01:27:30,077
And in terms of the other corridors proposals, I want to make sure that members of the public know that there is another opportunity, in addition to public participation tonight, there is another opportunity to learn more about this proposal in another forum tomorrow.

671
01:27:30,117 --> 01:27:37,022
We'll be having a public Q&A about the other corridors proposal at the Tufts University Cummings Center.

672
01:27:37,102 --> 01:27:38,322
And Alicia knows the room number.

673
01:27:38,342 --> 01:27:39,063
I don't.

674
01:27:42,522 --> 01:27:50,724
I just wanted to emphasize that the meeting tomorrow night is about, oh my gosh, the other corridors, as you said.

675
01:27:50,825 --> 01:27:53,965
So it's about the stuff that we've been talking about this evening.

676
01:27:54,766 --> 01:28:02,228
So all of those maps that were presented, if people aren't ready to comment on, they should come comment on tomorrow night.

677
01:28:03,068 --> 01:28:09,590
And my app that was going to tell me the room number, which it's on the second floor of the Cummings Center.

678
01:28:10,709 --> 01:28:13,236
And we'll have some signs and some people around.

679
01:28:13,256 --> 01:28:18,489
Sorry, I just, I don't want to misspeak the room number and then have

680
01:28:20,346 --> 01:28:20,746
It's room 270.

681
01:28:21,207 --> 01:28:25,149
So it's the second floor of the Cummings Center.

682
01:28:25,249 --> 01:28:28,430
There will be an online, so if people want to Zoom in, that's fine.

683
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:39,236
We will again have tables in the hallway where people can talk individually to Paola and Danielle about specific parcels, and then

684
01:28:40,777 --> 01:28:51,861
Emily and Kit, or Kit or Zach, I'm not sure which of you, sorry, which of the counselors will be there, and myself will be in the front of the room to answer Q&A and general questions.

685
01:28:53,141 --> 01:28:57,262
So that's tomorrow night in room 270 at the Tufts Cunning Center.

686
01:28:57,602 --> 01:28:57,863
Great.

687
01:28:58,203 --> 01:28:58,803
Thank you, Alicia.

688
01:28:59,823 --> 01:29:04,585
We'll make sure to get that room number posted on the city website as well.

689
01:29:04,645 --> 01:29:08,687
So that's the public Q and A on the other corridors, which we discussed at the beginning of this meeting.

690
01:29:09,827 --> 01:29:16,170
These Q and A's, we want to make sure that these are opportunities to really get targeted feedback on a specific proposal.

691
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:21,692
So the conversation and the presentation will be focused on the other corridors proposal we won't be talking about.

692
01:29:23,112 --> 01:29:24,073
the residential proposal.

693
01:29:24,093 --> 01:29:25,353
We won't be talking about the squares.

694
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:30,895
We're not going to be talking about neighborhood commercial nodes, nor the ACUs.

695
01:29:31,756 --> 01:29:40,899
But this is a really important opportunity for us to hear from the public, as is tonight, but there's not a lot of people here, on the other corridor's proposal.

696
01:29:41,239 --> 01:29:47,842
So really encourage folks to attend in person if they can, and on Zoom if they can't, and

697
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:54,969
All indications show that the hybrid portion should be a lot better than the one for the last Q&A.

698
01:29:55,069 --> 01:30:00,796
So thanks to Kevin Harrington and Director Hunt and Tufts University for making that happen.

699
01:30:04,408 --> 01:30:13,234
going to Madam Chair, I just wanted to mention that because there's been a lot of publicity about the Community Development Board meeting next Wednesday night.

700
01:30:14,274 --> 01:30:21,559
So we've been talking with the chair because we've also been notified that it's the same time as Medford High School graduation and there's a lot of

701
01:30:24,325 --> 01:30:24,625
there.

702
01:30:24,645 --> 01:30:34,130
Um so we'll definitely be having the consultants present the Medford Square and West Medford Square that was reported out of City Council.

703
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:39,973
And those documents, the language and the maps are now linked from the city.

704
01:30:40,453 --> 01:30:42,236
from the Community Development Board.

705
01:30:42,877 --> 01:30:48,026
Their website has a link to filings and it's there under West Medford and Medford Square.

706
01:30:48,367 --> 01:30:50,130
You can see those documents.

707
01:30:51,111 --> 01:30:53,575
We're discussing whether

708
01:30:54,844 --> 01:31:01,048
Whether or not we have the ability to take comment on the residential is going to depend on our attendance of our board members.

709
01:31:01,308 --> 01:31:10,573
We've had a member resign, and so we are very short on members right now, and we cannot risk not having quorum for future meetings.

710
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:22,333
We would request that all public comment that's coming in in writing come in by Monday the 2nd so that the board can review it in advance of the meeting.

711
01:31:22,353 --> 01:31:26,755
And we do expect it to go rather late.

712
01:31:26,895 --> 01:31:32,198
There is no opportunity to make that June 4th meeting a hybrid meeting, so it will be online only.

713
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:33,079
So one of the

714
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:53,748
that is under discussion is if we were to hold a special meeting of the CD board a little bit later, like in the next week or two, would we be able to then do a hybrid meeting by using, honestly, this room is the only good room that we can reliably work up, do a solid hybrid meeting.

715
01:31:55,149 --> 01:31:57,930
So we need to figure out whether that's possible.

716
01:31:58,570 --> 01:32:02,452
So I just wanted to sort of put the expectations out there.

717
01:32:03,032 --> 01:32:19,103
great thank you and so those expectations are if you want to submit written comment on the medford square west medford square or will you be taking a residential residential thought is really what we're concerned about it is my expectation that the medford squares that it's

718
01:32:20,003 --> 01:32:28,467
As it has been with this committee, to see the zoning one week, have it presented to them, and then let the board members sort of ruminate on it.

719
01:32:28,867 --> 01:32:34,550
And so there is no expectation that they would vote it out of committee the first time they hear it for the squares.

720
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:35,110
That makes sense.

721
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:41,593
So we're not actually expecting them to vote on what they see on Wednesday night for the squares.

722
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:42,013
Great.

723
01:32:42,053 --> 01:32:44,154
That would just be the first time that they're getting a presentation on it.

724
01:32:44,234 --> 01:32:44,294
OK.

725
01:32:44,334 --> 01:32:44,434
Yes.

726
01:32:44,534 --> 01:32:45,355
That makes total sense.

727
01:32:46,195 --> 01:32:46,515
Thank you.

728
01:32:47,596 --> 01:32:51,538
And the residential proposal will also be taken up by the CDB on June 4th.

729
01:32:51,818 --> 01:32:55,880
And you're saying if folks want to submit written comment, make sure to get that in by Monday the 2nd.

730
01:32:56,861 --> 01:33:01,863
And the meeting will be Zoom only as usual in this case.

731
01:33:02,564 --> 01:33:06,205
And that is expected to go quite late.

732
01:33:06,406 --> 01:33:08,106
So plan and caffeinate accordingly.

733
01:33:08,747 --> 01:33:14,650
Thank you very much for stating that and for helping us publicize that.

734
01:33:17,407 --> 01:33:18,249
I'll go to President Barras.

735
01:33:19,873 --> 01:33:23,482
I was going to make some motions if there's anything else you'd like to work on.

736
01:33:25,021 --> 01:33:25,681
Okay, thank you.

737
01:33:25,701 --> 01:33:33,125
So just real quickly, we talked about the public Q&A for other corridors proposal only tomorrow night.

738
01:33:34,626 --> 01:33:39,108
Director Hunt shared some updates about the CDB meeting next Wednesday.

739
01:33:40,108 --> 01:33:44,550
And so the next steps for the other corridors proposal is the Q&A tomorrow, and then that will come back to committee.

740
01:33:45,211 --> 01:33:53,815
And the neighborhood commercial nodes and accessory commercial units proposal will also come back to the planning and permitting committee for further discussion.

741
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:57,181
Great, thank you so much.

742
01:33:59,762 --> 01:34:05,984
Welcome to make a motion, President Behrs, before or after I ask for any public participation on either of these proposals.

743
01:34:06,004 --> 01:34:11,927
All right, we'll go to public participation first.

744
01:34:12,447 --> 01:34:14,768
I will start at the podium and then go to Zoom.

745
01:34:19,951 --> 01:34:21,511
William Navarre, 108 Medford Street.

746
01:34:22,011 --> 01:34:22,752
Hang on one second.

747
01:34:22,772 --> 01:34:23,692
I'm going to set up my timer.

748
01:34:24,112 --> 01:34:24,412
All right.

749
01:34:25,053 --> 01:34:25,473
Sorry about that.

750
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:33,599
All right, go ahead, William.

751
01:34:33,619 --> 01:34:33,880
Thank you.

752
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:34,460
All right.

753
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:40,002
First of all, I want to reiterate a point I made way back in 2022 at the Comprehensive Plan Public Combat Period.

754
01:34:40,022 --> 01:34:55,268
I think the trap of up-zoning corridors needs to be explicitly called out because in an American context, up-zoning along a transportation corridor often comes in the form of only up-zoning lots that face the major road or maybe one block from that if we are lucky.

755
01:34:55,963 --> 01:35:01,368
I think there is an equity element of concentrating apartment dwellers to the relatively noisy and polluted streets.

756
01:35:02,009 --> 01:35:08,074
It looks like, for whatever reason, most of my own street, Bedford Street, apparently fell off as compared to the last map I saw.

757
01:35:08,094 --> 01:35:09,696
There's a bit there still.

758
01:35:10,814 --> 01:35:14,636
But I'm still seeing Harvard Street corridor opportunity to add density.

759
01:35:14,796 --> 01:35:16,818
And I appreciate the opportunity to add density.

760
01:35:17,138 --> 01:35:22,581
But to me, it makes no sense why we'd want to concentrate more people living on Harvard Street specifically.

761
01:35:22,961 --> 01:35:29,305
I think it's only barely wider than the neighboring streets, but it has more travel lane and less parking lane, as far as I can tell.

762
01:35:29,565 --> 01:35:33,888
So it's noisier, more car exhaust than neighboring streets for that reason.

763
01:35:34,988 --> 01:35:37,830
So concretely, I think that

764
01:35:38,533 --> 01:35:41,235
know, to benefit health and give people more options.

765
01:35:41,536 --> 01:35:44,058
We should see the residential corridors be broader.

766
01:35:44,078 --> 01:35:46,540
It'd be nice to see Bedford Street fully come back.

767
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:51,524
It'd be good to see the entire triangle between Bedford Street, Main Street have the extra intensity.

768
01:35:52,165 --> 01:35:59,631
And it would be nice to see some more breadth around Harvard Street rather than just abutting that noisy, smoky street.

769
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:09,506
Next, I keep hearing a lot about parking and how that makes building difficult and might even foreclose on achieving our housing or commercial development goals.

770
01:36:10,106 --> 01:36:18,353
I really want us to keep in mind that it's in part a political choice if we are going to require parking to be centered in all of these discussions about what gets built.

771
01:36:19,053 --> 01:36:30,182
And our community through the city council has the ability to decide to leave that as a business decision and not require that private off street car parking be centered in our planning and development process

772
01:36:30,522 --> 01:36:32,044
as if it's the most important thing.

773
01:36:32,465 --> 01:36:32,885
Thank you.

774
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:37,551
Thank you, William.

775
01:36:40,715 --> 01:36:42,677
Going next to Cheryl on Zoom.

776
01:36:42,757 --> 01:36:44,039
Name and address for the record, please.

777
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:44,820
And you'll have three minutes.

778
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,022
Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 21 Park Street.

779
01:36:50,342 --> 01:36:52,264
My question is really just about the Q&A.

780
01:36:52,384 --> 01:36:54,446
Is there going to be parking to go to this location?

781
01:36:54,486 --> 01:36:58,109
Because this is not a location that I can walk or get a bus to.

782
01:36:58,129 --> 01:37:02,513
And I know a lot of people are going to have trouble parking there.

783
01:37:02,533 --> 01:37:07,418
And some people want to go in person because Zoom is not adequate for them.

784
01:37:08,078 --> 01:37:09,660
And then my second thing was just that

785
01:37:11,025 --> 01:37:12,406
People have cars in Medford.

786
01:37:12,466 --> 01:37:14,328
We have about two cars per unit.

787
01:37:14,748 --> 01:37:27,298
So the conversations about removing parking minimums is just creating more burden on the neighbors and giving the developers more profit by being able to not have to build parking and be responsible for their

788
01:37:27,734 --> 01:37:28,274
properties.

789
01:37:28,334 --> 01:37:41,462
If you want to remove parking minimums, then you should remove parking privileges first for those new buildings, just so that we can be realistic and not create a situation that we can't walk back from once those buildings exist without parking.

790
01:37:41,582 --> 01:37:45,944
Once those residents have three to six cars, those cars are going to be there.

791
01:37:46,064 --> 01:37:52,608
I myself live next door to a two family home that has about eight cars and two cars worth of parking, so six cars on the street.

792
01:37:53,068 --> 01:37:56,870
That's the reality of the situation here in Medford, and I hope that we can factor in

793
01:37:57,477 --> 01:38:06,545
our reality and that people here have cars, even people who've bought condos that come with deeded parking space know that they have cars and they're protected.

794
01:38:06,905 --> 01:38:15,853
But those of us that are relying on the streets are not gonna be protected if we just remove all the parking to add the density and it will lower the quality of life for the residents.

795
01:38:16,393 --> 01:38:20,377
But I'd like to hear about the parking for tomorrow night too, thanks.

796
01:38:27,955 --> 01:38:28,135
Great.

797
01:38:28,496 --> 01:38:29,639
Thank you, Cheryl.

798
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:36,875
For tomorrow, I hope that I'll just go to Director Hunt, who's saying something.

799
01:38:38,378 --> 01:38:38,558
Sorry.

800
01:38:41,893 --> 01:38:42,794
Yeah, great.

801
01:38:42,894 --> 01:38:50,179
I was going to say, I hope that residents will take advantage of parking spaces on Boston Ave, College.

802
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:55,783
It's possible that some parking spaces will be available at Dowling Ave for those who can't find street parking on Boston.

803
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:56,723
Go ahead, Director Hunt.

804
01:38:56,743 --> 01:39:00,746
And there's the 96 bus from Medford Square, the 94 bus.

805
01:39:00,846 --> 01:39:07,431
I think the 80 goes right down there as well, although I'm less familiar with the buses that don't come from Medford Square.

806
01:39:08,893 --> 01:39:09,934
Great, thank you.

807
01:39:11,055 --> 01:39:14,238
I'm gonna go to President Behrs and then back to public participation.

808
01:39:18,662 --> 01:39:20,284
Nevermind, I was gonna say what Alicia said.

809
01:39:21,345 --> 01:39:22,045
Okay, thank you.

810
01:39:22,926 --> 01:39:24,788
Going to Andrew on Zoom.

811
01:39:25,028 --> 01:39:27,010
Name and address for the record, please, and you'll have three minutes.

812
01:39:29,512 --> 01:39:30,813
Hi there, Andrew McRobert, 6310 Muir.

813
01:39:33,556 --> 01:39:38,038
I want to speak on the ACUs and residential commercial.

814
01:39:38,638 --> 01:39:47,302
I support individual rights to build on one's own property, and I think every neighborhood should be allowed to evolve into its next stage of growth.

815
01:39:48,482 --> 01:40:02,128
I think the ACUs as proposed support this well by allowing residents to invest in their neighborhood with smaller bets, and so they can iteratively

816
01:40:03,923 --> 01:40:09,067
you know, build out their commercial as was outlined in the commercial incubator.

817
01:40:10,648 --> 01:40:18,934
I think I saw a maximum parking for residential commercial on one of those slides, which I love.

818
01:40:19,294 --> 01:40:25,799
I think that's important to make sure that our residential neighborhoods don't become surface parking lots.

819
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:31,363
I would like to, again, advocate for

820
01:40:32,471 --> 01:40:44,796
On the list of permitted uses, neighborhood daycares or daycares, maybe call them neighborhood and maybe give a maximum enrollment of 10 kids or something like that.

821
01:40:46,456 --> 01:40:56,080
Something to make sure that this is still something that's serving the immediate neighborhood and is walkable rather than something that people are driving to.

822
01:40:58,178 --> 01:41:05,280
My final point is I want to talk a little bit about the suitability study that was shown in its current form.

823
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:12,762
It listed, it showed my neighborhood over in North Glenwood as low suitability.

824
01:41:13,982 --> 01:41:19,244
But living here, I have to say it feels pretty high, highly suitable.

825
01:41:21,088 --> 01:41:45,064
As a resident of Kenya, I try to walk to Salem street and some of the immediate neighborhood commercial businesses that do exist as much as possible, but they're far enough out of the way that sometimes I do feel like I have to just get in my car and drive.

826
01:41:45,644 --> 01:41:49,546
And that's as a able-bodied 36 year old man.

827
01:41:52,340 --> 01:42:01,056
I think maybe it was deemed low suitability due to its closeness to Wellington, but in East Strip, but

828
01:42:02,401 --> 01:42:17,252
Anybody who knows East strip and rivers edge and and station landing knows that this is not a pedestrian friendly area and it's not somewhere that you just go and walk to to run an errand.

829
01:42:17,813 --> 01:42:23,317
You're going to run into a fence on a property line that is preventing you from taking the most direct path.

830
01:42:24,118 --> 01:42:28,481
So I would like to, I would love to see that area considered.

831
01:42:29,844 --> 01:42:32,147
higher sustainability or suitability.

832
01:42:32,187 --> 01:42:32,487
Thank you.

833
01:42:34,329 --> 01:42:34,610
Great.

834
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:36,332
Thank you so much for your comments.

835
01:42:37,513 --> 01:42:39,295
Andrew, we will take that into consideration.

836
01:42:39,535 --> 01:42:43,300
And I saw some nods when you brought up neighborhood daycare as well.

837
01:42:44,181 --> 01:42:44,862
Oh, there you go, Paola.

838
01:42:48,856 --> 01:42:49,676
Thank you.

839
01:42:49,716 --> 01:42:50,696
Thank you for your comments.

840
01:42:51,137 --> 01:42:56,678
Um we will look into this map, so we will look into this higher and lower, um.

841
01:42:57,518 --> 01:42:58,899
Priority areas.

842
01:42:59,779 --> 01:43:01,699
Um and maybe we need to.

843
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,120
Make it shorter.

844
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:07,181
The distance from the corridors and squares.

845
01:43:08,061 --> 01:43:08,281
Um.

846
01:43:09,302 --> 01:43:11,662
We are also building the zoning so that the

847
01:43:20,222 --> 01:43:29,706
commercial and that it more mixed use so that it's not what is existing, but because your current zoning does not allow a lot of the commercial that is existing.

848
01:43:30,186 --> 01:43:39,770
So in that case, these quarters will have will be permitted to have a lot more different business and more of them.

849
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:43,091
So that's one thing as well to be considered.

850
01:43:43,811 --> 01:43:44,051
Um.

851
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:47,134
About the parking and the proposal.

852
01:43:47,694 --> 01:43:55,060
This comes from another proposal that we did in the city of Fittsville, so we will review that and the parking minimums, etcetera.

853
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,402
But that was the idea of what could be.

854
01:43:57,442 --> 01:44:05,968
It's not really the exact draft and the Dakers are not there because the Dakers is a protected use, so it's something that we cannot.

855
01:44:07,630 --> 01:44:13,074
We cannot deny they are protected so they can be in in any district.

856
01:44:16,747 --> 01:44:18,248
Oh, thank you for that clarification, Paola.

857
01:44:18,268 --> 01:44:29,616
So that's the daycare doesn't have to be a specific allowed use under the proposed neighborhood commercial nodes and ACUs because they don't need permission.

858
01:44:29,636 --> 01:44:31,017
They don't need special permission.

859
01:44:38,983 --> 01:44:39,183
Go ahead.

860
01:44:40,696 --> 01:44:46,081
Yeah, so we can add them, but we are not able to restrict the size because it is a protected.

861
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:46,682
I see.

862
01:44:46,842 --> 01:44:47,162
I see.

863
01:44:47,443 --> 01:44:47,663
Okay.

864
01:44:49,685 --> 01:44:50,005
Thank you.

865
01:44:54,149 --> 01:44:54,349
Great.

866
01:44:54,490 --> 01:44:57,733
Is there any additional public participation on either of these proposals?

867
01:45:01,215 --> 01:45:12,783
Seeing none, thank you so much for the updated presentation and analysis of these topics, Emily and Paola, and thank you for the thoughtful discussion, my fellow councilors and city staff and members of the public.

868
01:45:14,744 --> 01:45:16,586
Is there a motion?

869
01:45:16,606 --> 01:45:21,769
I move to keep the paper and proposals in committee and adjourn.

870
01:45:25,468 --> 01:45:31,611
On the motion by President Behrs to keep the paper in committee and adjourn, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

871
01:45:33,432 --> 01:45:34,853
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

872
01:45:56,202 --> 01:45:56,722
President Behrs?

873
01:45:57,763 --> 01:45:58,023
Yes.

874
01:45:59,104 --> 01:46:00,184
Councilor Callahan is absent.

875
01:46:00,565 --> 01:46:01,105
Councilor Lemming?

876
01:46:01,405 --> 01:46:01,505
Yes.

877
01:46:02,046 --> 01:46:02,746
Councilor Scarpelli?

878
01:46:03,446 --> 01:46:03,707
Yes.

879
01:46:05,308 --> 01:46:06,068
Vice President Collins?

880
01:46:06,608 --> 01:46:06,828
Yes.

881
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:09,310
Four in favor, one absent.

882
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:11,611
The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

883
01:46:11,791 --> 01:46:12,552
Thank you very much, everybody.
