[SPEAKER_15]: So we do have a quorum.

58
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:29,706
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're good to go.

59
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:37,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all for hopping on.

60
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:47,749
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think this will be a very brief meeting, but I did want to give you a number of updates just in terms of where we are in the process and what we have ahead of us.

61
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:49,830
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll do that in just a minute.

62
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:59,332
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have a consent agenda to approve the meeting minutes from the 7-17 full committee meeting.

63
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:01,632

64
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:03,913
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

65
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:05,903
[SPEAKER_15]: And is there a second?

66
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:07,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

67
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:15,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so motion by Tracy Keene, two of the minutes, with a second by Aaron Olapade.

68
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:17,668

[SPEAKER_04]: Still trying, but you can't hear me.

80
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:41,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we can hear you.

81
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:41,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you can.

82
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:42,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

83
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:42,549

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

89
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:55,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Emily Lazzaro.

90
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:56,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

91
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Nicole Morell.

92
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

93
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:01,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Aaron Olapade.

94
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:02,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

95
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:04,064
[SPEAKER_15]: And Luke Preissner.

96
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:13,742
[SPEAKER_15]: 11 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, four absent.

97
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:14,542
[SPEAKER_15]: The minutes are approved.

98
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:25,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so flipping back to our agenda, I just wanted to give you all a couple of updates, and then we have really one topic to discuss.

99
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:31,953
[SPEAKER_15]: So as you know, when we met back even in July, we talked about...

100
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:42,536
[SPEAKER_15]: that all of our documentation had been submitted and that we were awaiting information from the MSBA about the enrollment study.

101
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:51,358
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have, since that time, we have met with the MSBA about our enrollment projections.

102
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:53,479
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you all recall,

103
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:08,143
[SPEAKER_15]: That is a critical step in this eligibility phase because what the design enrollment is certified at that we will ultimately agree to with MSBA is how we will go forward to size the building.

104
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:14,204
[SPEAKER_15]: So in terms of any project that comes next, right?

105
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:18,965
[SPEAKER_15]: So that we all have to agree on like how many students are we trying to accommodate for?

106
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:23,966
[SPEAKER_15]: We provided a whole bunch of information to them about Medford's housing market.

107
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:29,115
[SPEAKER_15]: about our historical enrollment, among other things.

108
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,237
[SPEAKER_15]: And we did hold an enrollment meeting with them.

109
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:43,924
[SPEAKER_15]: They presented us their preliminary numbers and they had a series of really good questions for us about what may not have like, I'll say like,

110
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:50,285
[SPEAKER_15]: come through in answering the questions that they standardly pose.

111
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:57,367
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had a really good conversation about some of the additional factors from Medford's perspective.

112
00:08:57,427 --> 00:09:04,968
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor is part of the Metro Planning Council, and they are committed to helping the governor achieve their goals.

113
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:07,969
[SPEAKER_15]: We have an aggressive housing production plan, those kinds of things.

114
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:13,970
[SPEAKER_15]: So we were able to have some good conversation about a whole variety of topics that impact enrollment.

115
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,451
[SPEAKER_15]: At the end of the conversation, they asked us for some more information.

116
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:21,794
[SPEAKER_15]: So we actually did provide that to them in mid-August.

117
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:25,516
[SPEAKER_15]: And we are awaiting feedback from them about the next step.

118
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:35,201
[SPEAKER_15]: So more to come on getting through this last piece of the eligibility phase as we hear from them.

119
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:51,987
[SPEAKER_15]: What we have done in the meantime is thanks to the help of Will Pipicelli, who's on the call, he is replacing Tom Dalton on the committee as soon as the school committee votes that change through officially, but he's here tonight.

120
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:53,008
[SPEAKER_15]: He's joined us.

121
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:55,991
[SPEAKER_15]: He's our director of communications for the district.

122
00:09:56,931 --> 00:10:01,676
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wanted to welcome him to the team unofficially and we'll welcome him officially once the committee...

123
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:03,657
[SPEAKER_15]: goes through that process.

124
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:08,639
[SPEAKER_15]: But Will and I have been working on two efforts.

125
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:19,065
[SPEAKER_15]: One is to take all the documentation that we had to submit to MSBA around this enrollment study and put it into a digestible format.

126
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:29,471
[SPEAKER_15]: The other was to do the same with all the maintenance and capital planning information that we had to submit because all of those submissions go into their computer system and they

127
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:37,656
[SPEAKER_15]: don't spit out all that great or with like enough context that it would sort of resonate for us to post that on our website.

128
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:43,000
[SPEAKER_15]: So I believe that you all received both of those documents before the meeting.

129
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,582
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really just more for you to have.

130
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:53,627
[SPEAKER_15]: We would obviously, we do plan to post those on the website so that everybody can see them.

131
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:57,069
[SPEAKER_15]: But those two documents are hot off the presses.

132
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:59,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Will and I were working on finalizing them today.

133
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:04,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Many, many thanks to Will for his work on that.

134
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:08,495
[SPEAKER_15]: Pulling together all of the information was not an easy task.

135
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,755
[SPEAKER_15]: There's lots of attachments.

136
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:15,078
[SPEAKER_15]: The enrollment projection information is particularly sort of tedious to...

137
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:17,233
[SPEAKER_15]: to get through and understand.

138
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:19,934
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for that, Will.

139
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:25,057
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to make sure that you all saw those attachments from Lisa just a little bit ago.

140
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,238
[SPEAKER_15]: So take a look.

141
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:29,499
[SPEAKER_15]: We will post them on the website.

142
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,981
[SPEAKER_15]: I will plan to share them out on social media.

143
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:39,545
[SPEAKER_15]: And Will and I will talk about a plan to do that from the school account instead of from my personal account so that there can be record of that.

144
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:42,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wanted to provide that update.

145
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,103
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're still very much in wait mode.

146
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:56,331
[SPEAKER_15]: And we are waiting on those next steps from the MSBA and just ready and willing when they have questions.

147
00:11:56,371 --> 00:12:00,894
[SPEAKER_15]: So I am planning to touch base with our contact there later this week.

148
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:05,757
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will let you know if there's anything material that sort of comes next.

149
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:09,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, in terms of the timeline,

150
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:21,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I'm not a hundred percent clear when we will sort of exit this phase because we are sort of at, we're at the end, but we're not done.

151
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:29,016
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think some of that will drive, um, the board meeting, um, placement wherever we, um, wherever we land, once we get through this process.

152
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:36,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, the other, uh, part of the timeline is I haven't scheduled any meetings because I don't want to take up your valuable time.

153
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:36,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Um,

154
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:40,598
[SPEAKER_15]: until we have better clarity on those next steps.

155
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:53,440
[SPEAKER_15]: We will talk a little bit about sort of getting ready for the next phase in just a minute, but we are going to try to use this time to provide some opportunities for folks to go tour other buildings.

156
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,161
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have a tour of Arlington High School on the books for next week.

157
00:12:57,621 --> 00:12:59,002
[SPEAKER_15]: You're all welcome to join us.

158
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:00,702
[SPEAKER_15]: It's at three o'clock on the 24th.

159
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,543
[SPEAKER_15]: The Arlington Project is...

160
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:14,714
[SPEAKER_15]: probably even more open now than it was when I went to tour the building back in like May or June because it is a phased renovation.

161
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:27,977
[SPEAKER_15]: We are also working on plans to talk to Waltham, Somerville, Stoneham, and Bill Ricka.

162
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:36,122
[SPEAKER_15]: So more to come as we get those dates on the calendar and Lisa will push out invitations to you all to join us as you are able.

163
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:44,766
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're sort of taking this time where we have some quiet time to also take some tours and get inspired.

164
00:13:44,886 --> 00:13:52,549
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's on the immediate agenda and we'll work through getting those on the books and then we can regroup if there's anywhere else that we want to take a look at.

165
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Questions about the timeline?

166
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:23,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so the other major part of our agenda today is that as we start sort of looking forward to that next phase, our next, assuming that we are invited to the next phase, which is part of this MSBA process, the next phase really would be for us to...

167
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:33,997
[SPEAKER_15]: put out a public procurement and onboard our owner's project manager who will help lead this project forward as it gets increasingly technical.

168
00:14:34,697 --> 00:14:51,922
[SPEAKER_15]: So in order to do that under MSBA's guidelines, what we need to do is form an OPM selection committee that will help sort of get that procurement in place and out the door and shepherd that through the selection process.

169
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,020
[SPEAKER_15]: There are certain people that have to be on the committee.

170
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Fiona is one of them.

171
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,041
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe Bob Dickinson is another.

172
00:15:01,061 --> 00:15:03,222
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he has to be on the committee.

173
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:15,286
[SPEAKER_15]: But I did want to talk about that among this group because there is also a gate that the school committee will need to approve whoever that selection committee is.

174
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:22,568
[SPEAKER_15]: So even though they're a subcommittee of our committee, according to MSBA, the school committee needs to sign off.

175
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:29,592
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wanted to open that up for a little bit of discussion about the sort of our best next steps.

176
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:37,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we want to nominate folks tonight so that I can sort of be ready to feed that to the school committee when appropriate?

177
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:39,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Or do we want to do that at a later meeting?

178
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:46,302
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm open to both options, but I know the school committee agenda can be sort of big and packed at times.

179
00:15:46,382 --> 00:15:52,326
[SPEAKER_15]: So advanced notice would be helpful because then I have a little bit of runway to figure out how to get it on the agenda.

180
00:15:53,422 --> 00:16:03,615
[SPEAKER_15]: But that team, I believe, can start meeting to start to do the documentation work to put the procurement documents in place.

181
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:10,565
[SPEAKER_15]: So I do think if we sort of have that committee at the ready, they can be moving along because.

182
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:20,392
[SPEAKER_15]: the ultimate goal of this next phase is to get the OPM on board and then ultimately the designer or the architect, but the OPM comes first.

183
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:26,273
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have to do the OPM and then the architect, and then we can get to ultimately the feasibility study.

184
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:27,854
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll stop there.

185
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:32,795
[SPEAKER_15]: If anyone has any comments, questions, thoughts, I'm happy to take them.

186
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:35,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny, can I just say two things?

187
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:36,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

188
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:42,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, I was just called to a meeting yesterday via Zoom for Everett.

189
00:16:43,513 --> 00:16:49,517
[SPEAKER_01]: What I don't think we knew, or maybe you all knew and I didn't, Everett is looking to build a new school and enhance their vocational programming.

190
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:54,060
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember before when we didn't really look in our range because nobody was a competing factor?

191
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that this is competing, but they're opening similar programs.

192
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,624
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're on the same timeline as them.

193
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that?

194
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:02,166
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

195
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:03,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.

196
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:06,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they were invited at the same meeting we were.

197
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

198
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:15,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second thing was anytime we can tour Somerville or Waltham will be amazing because that's really the vision of our blended school.

199
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,923
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all.

200
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:17,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Waltham, beautiful.

201
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,306
[SPEAKER_01]: When I drive by it, it's incredible.

202
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Except those bleachers.

203
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:35,193
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, if you all haven't seen the news articles, there's an issue in their gymnasium of the newly opened school where their bleachers are too big for the school.

204
00:17:35,700 --> 00:18:03,322
[SPEAKER_15]: gym itself and so they the bleachers come out onto the playing floor um so now that i've said that it'll be in your social media feed and you can take a look at the article but um yeah so we we are trying to um to get to to waltham um in particular i know that they just opened so they will it'll be a different aspect of like sort of their reactions to that building for sure

205
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:23,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Jenny, in reference to this committee, I want to say what demographics of this committee do you want represented on that in terms of how you see expertise that we could bring to the committee and what is the time commitment?

206
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:42,543
[SPEAKER_15]: So part of the work of that committee is going to be to sort of follow the template set out by MSBA around the procurements and make sure that we're in good position to be in compliance with all of Medford's procurement.

207
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:44,105
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think, you know...

208
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:50,115
[SPEAKER_15]: if you have procurement experience, that's a plus, because that is fundamentally what we're doing.

209
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:57,438
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have experience working with OPMs, I think that is also a plus.

210
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:10,683
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, bringing that group together, the other thing that group will do is figure out, like, what is the process that we're going to go through to actually select the OPM?

211
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:11,804
[SPEAKER_15]: And

212
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:21,120
[SPEAKER_15]: I would imagine that this larger group will certainly be invited to the table to listen to presentations and things like that.

213
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:31,167
[SPEAKER_15]: But ultimately, the recommendation and the selection of the OPM is going to have to sort of go through the selection committee and then to us.

214
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:35,270
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think time-wise, it's going to happen in like...

215
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:41,065
[SPEAKER_15]: sort of bursts, and I can't really even tell you when the bursts will happen.

216
00:19:41,686 --> 00:19:44,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly, there's some upfront work to get those ARFPs out.

217
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:52,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Once they're out, there's sort of a quiet period, right, where we have to answer some questions, and then we really can't talk about the bid.

218
00:19:54,024 --> 00:20:02,870
[SPEAKER_15]: And then once everything comes in, we'll have to have an established timeline to work through all of those submissions, do interviews, and ultimately make a selection.

219
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,973
[SPEAKER_15]: So whenever that happens, it's going to be the most time intensive space.

220
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:13,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of that will be a function of how many OPMs bid.

221
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:21,662
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's really hard to know, but doing bid reviews can be really, really time consuming.

222
00:20:22,928 --> 00:20:26,632
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think there's a decent amount of work there for the team.

223
00:20:29,214 --> 00:20:30,876
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to ask about the OPM.

224
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,897
[SPEAKER_11]: So you mentioned the OPM.

225
00:20:32,718 --> 00:20:36,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Normally, there's three agents involved in these construction projects.

226
00:20:36,622 --> 00:20:39,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Aside from the OPM, there's an architect, there's a construction manager.

227
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:41,686
[SPEAKER_11]: We picked the OPM first.

228
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:42,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.

229
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:45,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the OPM have a role in...

230
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:50,125
[SPEAKER_11]: selecting or influencing the other two, or is it a forced marriage?

231
00:20:50,865 --> 00:21:06,493
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look at press articles and just kind of look at all the other projects in the region, it becomes clear that there's a handful, probably somewhere between a half dozen and a dozen companies that do this, and they typically swap hats depending on which project they're working on.

232
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:19,553
[SPEAKER_11]: And so is it a forced marriage or does the OPM have a role in guiding their preferred construction manager partner as well as their preferred architect?

233
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:22,910
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a couple questions there.

234
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,911
[SPEAKER_15]: One is not all people play all roles.

235
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:27,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Not all organizations do all the roles.

236
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:28,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Some do.

237
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:31,652
[SPEAKER_15]: So some are architects and OPMs.

238
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:33,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Some are just architects.

239
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:34,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Some are just OPMs.

240
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:37,334
[SPEAKER_15]: And any version of that could...

241
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:40,266
[SPEAKER_15]: be what we see in terms of our bid.

242
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:46,988
[SPEAKER_15]: The OPM is going to help us do the heavy lifting to get the designer and the construction manager on board.

243
00:21:47,068 --> 00:21:51,969
[SPEAKER_15]: So this work of getting the OPM on board is our work to do.

244
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:57,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Once we do that, we now have somebody like paid staff that's going to help shepherd the rest of that along.

245
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,211
[SPEAKER_15]: They certainly are going to have a wealth of information about who does this work.

246
00:22:04,144 --> 00:22:05,465
[SPEAKER_15]: who they've worked with before.

247
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:09,088
[SPEAKER_15]: But ultimately, this committee is going to make those selections.

248
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,191
[SPEAKER_15]: So no, there is no such thing as a forced marriage.

249
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:18,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Who we hire to be the architect, who we hire to be the construction manager is up to this committee.

250
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:27,303
[SPEAKER_15]: But the OPM, you know, ideally is the person who can help guide this committee and do the heavy lifting for us once we have them on board.

251
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:32,888
[SPEAKER_15]: But it is really important to pick an OPM that sort of reflects

252
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:36,386
[SPEAKER_15]: what we want to see as we go forward.

253
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:40,529
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, finding the OPM that's a good fit for us is really, really important.

254
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:50,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?

255
00:22:55,541 --> 00:23:01,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Chair Graham, could you just tell me the timeframe that we would be putting out an RFP?

256
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:03,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Or would we want to put out an RFP?

257
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:05,362
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

258
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:26,452
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I think as soon as we are invited to the next phase, I would like our RFP to be out the door within 30 days max, because the sooner we do that, the sooner we have somebody on board and the sooner those next phases can happen, which is why I would like to get the procurement documents created in advance of that.

259
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:33,496
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's really hard to say because it will be driven by when MSBA invites us to

260
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:37,038
[SPEAKER_15]: the board meeting to advance us to the next round.

261
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,182
[SPEAKER_15]: So those options, they meet every other month.

262
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:42,883
[SPEAKER_15]: They do not meet in September.

263
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:47,007
[SPEAKER_15]: So they meet in October, they meet in December and they meet in February.

264
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:59,217
[SPEAKER_15]: If I had to guess, like where I think we're likely to be at the December board meeting, there's maybe an outside chance we'll make it to October, but we're not slated.

265
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:02,860
[SPEAKER_15]: We were not originally slated to go to a board meeting until I think February.

266
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and I'm sorry if I missed it.

267
00:24:06,332 --> 00:24:17,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we set up, can we let you know who on this committee is interested in being on that procurement team and form that procurement team prior to the board meeting?

268
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:25,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, I think we can have that conversation and decide who those folks are.

269
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:29,467
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to go to the school committee for approval.

270
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:35,211
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't believe there's any reason why we can't begin work, but I will confirm that with MSBA.

271
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:42,655
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think if there are people who want to be part of this process, those nominations tonight would be helpful.

272
00:24:45,168 --> 00:24:45,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Luke?

273
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:45,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

274
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

275
00:24:49,932 --> 00:24:51,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, follow-up question to the earlier.

276
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:57,899
[SPEAKER_11]: So in terms of next step, feasibility is the next phase in this long-chain process.

277
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:09,029
[SPEAKER_11]: And do we need to have all of the agents, OKM, architect, construction manager named in order...

278
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:16,060
[SPEAKER_11]: begin a feasibility study or can we proceed with a feasibility study with just the OPM?

279
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,102
[SPEAKER_15]: The next phase is forming the team, which includes the OPM and the architect.

280
00:25:23,703 --> 00:25:25,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Then the feasibility study happens.

281
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:31,446
[SPEAKER_15]: So the two things that must happen are we must have an OPM and we must have an architect.

282
00:25:31,926 --> 00:25:33,787
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we get invited to feasibility.

283
00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:35,928
[SPEAKER_15]: The construction manager comes later.

284
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:41,238
[SPEAKER_15]: But we so we have to get the OPM on board.

285
00:25:41,518 --> 00:25:46,199
[SPEAKER_15]: They will help us get the designer on board and then we will be ready for feasibility.

286
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:51,001
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's actually several there's a couple of MSBA gates there in the middle.

287
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:56,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they they do have to approve our OPM, they have to approve our designer.

288
00:25:57,242 --> 00:25:59,223
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of approvals that they have to do along the way.

289
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:16,984
[SPEAKER_15]: I do believe that Fiona has to be on the team and I believe Bob does, but they are both non-voting members of this committee.

290
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:25,268
[SPEAKER_15]: So there need to be at least three voting members of the committee on this subcommittee as well.

291
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:33,071
[SPEAKER_15]: So I certainly will be on the committee, but I would love other folks to join us as well.

292
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:37,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Having worked for many OPMs, please excuse my voice tonight.

293
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:40,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be happy to be on the committee.

294
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:42,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Libby.

295
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:55,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anybody else that's dying to be on the committee?

296
00:26:55,556 --> 00:27:00,798
[SPEAKER_15]: And that goes for non-voting members as well.

297
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:03,560
[SPEAKER_15]: You're very welcome to be on the committee.

298
00:27:05,578 --> 00:27:08,970
[SPEAKER_15]: We just need to make sure we have enough voting members that it can be a legitimate committee to.

299
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:16,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I would, but I don't have any, you know, real construction experience here in this area.

300
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:18,585
[SPEAKER_10]: All mine's in the West Coast.

301
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:20,727
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't have the contacts.

302
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:22,869
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you guys get desperate, let me know.

303
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:27,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I can do investigation, look up companies.

304
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:32,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a few references and stuff with the union also and know a couple architects locally.

305
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:35,320
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we could work together and figure out who would be good.

306
00:27:36,178 --> 00:27:39,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there's definitely a circuit of folks that play in this space.

307
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,942
[SPEAKER_15]: So we will proactively reach out to all of them.

308
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:48,384
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're at conferences, they're at school committee conferences and things like that.

309
00:27:48,404 --> 00:27:51,526
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have plenty of opportunities to meet folks.

310
00:27:54,828 --> 00:27:56,249
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear Peter has some experience.

311
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Cushing?

312
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:04,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked with the owner, Paul Riggie,

313
00:28:05,522 --> 00:28:27,266
[SPEAKER_05]: uh and other members uh on the hvac opm selection team and have previously worked on opm selections for other districts is there anything else out in the in the universe here that would like to participate

314
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,804
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like Larry, I can offer to support.

315
00:28:35,824 --> 00:28:46,952
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no experience in this particular, but I'm happy to learn if people feel like I would be an addition, I'm happy to be involved, but I do not have any experience directly.

316
00:28:47,153 --> 00:28:49,054
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.

317
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:57,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I can also just say that I would be, I'm,

318
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:03,645
[SPEAKER_04]: less than an asset to this sort of committee.

319
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:05,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And also that I don't, I don't have time.

320
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:10,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really sorry, but I'm here and I'm listening.

321
00:29:11,268 --> 00:29:12,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

322
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:22,273
[SPEAKER_15]: So Aaron, maybe you can be our fourth member so that we have some flexibility in terms of having a forum.

323
00:29:22,613 --> 00:29:28,416
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes you just need arms and legs, people to review, make sure things make sense.

324
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:33,331
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that would be a great role for you.

325
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:36,612
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can learn all about the city's procurement process.

326
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:39,073
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'm sure that can be useful somewhere else.

327
00:29:41,774 --> 00:29:42,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

328
00:29:42,554 --> 00:29:52,518
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I have is Jenny, Libby, Peter, Aaron, Fiona, and Bob, if Bob is required and or wants to be on the committee.

329
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:54,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anybody else?

330
00:29:55,202 --> 00:29:56,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny, I'll help out any way I can.

331
00:29:57,283 --> 00:30:04,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I have experience with the Science Lab project, with the Boiler Room MSBA projects, and obviously with Fiona.

332
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:06,828
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can help you out, I'll help you out any way I can.

333
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:08,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'm going to put your name down.

334
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,452
[SPEAKER_15]: So is there a motion to approve this group?

335
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:17,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Fiona, Bob, if required, Jenny, Libby, Peter, Aaron, and John.

336
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:20,556
[SPEAKER_15]: So moved.

432
00:36:01,181 --> 00:36:02,722

433
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,524
[SPEAKER_15]: I did too.

434
00:36:04,924 --> 00:36:06,025

00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:18,558

[SPEAKER_15]: So welcome.

[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Wilfred Pacelli.

442
00:36:26,806 --> 00:36:29,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I joined the team here in Medford around late July.

443
00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:35,548
[SPEAKER_07]: So catching myself up to speed with all things Medford, really happy to see the students are back in our buildings.

444
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:39,869
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been so nice to kind of see them throughout the hallways and whatnot.

445
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:43,169
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very happy to be part of this project as well.

446
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:50,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Being able to build the high school and create a space for so many generations of students is a really great opportunity.

447
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:51,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that

448
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,531
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I get to be part of it pretty much from day one.

449
00:36:54,591 --> 00:36:55,471
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super exciting.

450
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:56,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So really happy to be here.

451
00:36:56,672 --> 00:37:04,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking forward to working with everyone in this call, as well as the other members of the committee that we were just hanging out with on the last call.

452
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,115
[SPEAKER_07]: So looking forward to it and can't wait to get started.

453
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:07,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Will.

454
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:17,752
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Will and I have, as I mentioned in the last meeting, been working behind the scenes to sort of make some of those submissions a little bit more digestible.

455
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:24,514
[SPEAKER_15]: All the credit to Will for doing a really fabulous job and doing it in a really quick turnaround kind of way.

456
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:25,334
[SPEAKER_15]: So, thank you.

457
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:33,176
[SPEAKER_15]: And we will post those out on the website and make them available for people.

458
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:34,177
[SPEAKER_15]: I think...

459
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:46,672
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, the maintenance and capital planning document is, is like dry reading, because it's about maintenance and capital planning, which is inherently not that exciting.

460
00:37:46,792 --> 00:38:05,247
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's actually like a lot of really great information in there about how the district is moving forward around maintenance, our custodial services, we have a green cleaning plan, we have

461
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,693
[SPEAKER_15]: an ongoing preventive maintenance plan.

462
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:17,516
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a lot of things now that are documented that was not always the case.

463
00:38:17,576 --> 00:38:23,439
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's nice to be able to sort of showcase all of those things in one cohesive package.

464
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:34,665
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing that's really enlightening about that document, I think, is when you look at some of the capital planning questions that the MSBA posed.

465
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:43,530
[SPEAKER_15]: They asked questions like, how big is your maintenance budget and how big should it be?

466
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:47,457
[SPEAKER_15]: if there's a gap, why is there a gap?

467
00:38:48,438 --> 00:38:52,962
[SPEAKER_15]: So they really are looking for people to be good stewards of their funding.

468
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,565
[SPEAKER_15]: And they asked really good questions.

469
00:38:56,586 --> 00:39:03,212
[SPEAKER_15]: They asked us to break things down sometimes in ways that we don't break things down in our sort of universe here in Medford.

470
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:09,518
[SPEAKER_15]: So that has led to some conversations about breaking things down differently in the future, which I think is all good stuff.

471
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:16,601
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the other document about the enrollment projection I thought was very enlightening.

472
00:39:17,281 --> 00:39:26,446
[SPEAKER_15]: That one took a lot of work to come together cohesively because they were seemingly very desperate things that had to be covered.

473
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:38,151
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were able to, I think, do a good job of sharing in that document everything that we've provided to MSBA about our plans and some of the things that we see coming down the line.

474
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:50,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and ultimately a justification for a building size for 1500 students plus, um, 200, um, 200 pre-K students.

475
00:39:51,159 --> 00:40:00,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and I think, uh, another 100 kids corner, um, early childhood folks.

476
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:02,082
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, children.

477
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:06,563
[SPEAKER_15]: So the total enrollment we put forward was 1800, which includes 1500 high school.

478
00:40:09,689 --> 00:40:18,395
[SPEAKER_15]: 200 pre-K programming, and then 100 for kids scoring to sort of comprise everything that is in the building.

479
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:29,083
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's sort of interesting to dig in there and see some of the information that we provided them, particularly if you've ever wondered like, what are we doing in housing in Medford?

480
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:34,907
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a nice handy summary of those things because we really had to boil it up to provide it to MSBA.

481
00:40:35,527 --> 00:40:38,690
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll get those out on the website.

482
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:45,435
[SPEAKER_15]: But I did want to have some space on the agenda in case there was anything else that you all were thinking about for the website.

483
00:40:45,495 --> 00:40:48,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that we have Will on board, he'll be taking the reins on that.

484
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,220
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to open it up to the group.

485
00:40:51,661 --> 00:41:00,188
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there's not been tons of conversation of late in the community about this project because we've got other big things to talk about as a community.

486
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:03,851
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that that will continue through November.

487
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:11,957
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think just as soon as that's done and we're sort of moving on to those next gates, this will become all the conversations.

488
00:41:11,977 --> 00:41:19,443
[SPEAKER_15]: So I did want to like set aside just a little bit of time for us to think about like some of the planning exercises to be ready for that.

489
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:24,508
[SPEAKER_15]: So is there any, does anybody have any questions, comments about the website, Luke?

490
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:26,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

491
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:29,732
[SPEAKER_11]: So earlier on the other meeting we talked about in the OPM,

492
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:35,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently, we're sort of cash constrained.

493
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,540
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a short timeline.

494
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:43,967
[SPEAKER_11]: We should have realistic sort of design goals for what our website contains.

495
00:41:44,948 --> 00:41:46,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Personally, I prefer substance over pizzazz.

496
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:49,553
[SPEAKER_11]: But at some point, there's going to be

497
00:41:50,727 --> 00:41:59,333
[SPEAKER_11]: a need actually for Pizzazz to kind of present the project in its best light, make navigation, looking for information convenient, all those things.

498
00:41:59,914 --> 00:42:08,640
[SPEAKER_11]: So back to the OPM, when we select an OPM, is there a sort of responsibility that they have

499
00:42:09,852 --> 00:42:18,197
[SPEAKER_11]: for organizing kind of a professional website, which is common to all of these school building projects.

500
00:42:19,197 --> 00:42:28,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I do believe that they play heavily in that space, as well as in general in this community engagement space.

501
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:36,547
[SPEAKER_15]: So they will help drive some of the community engagement events that happen as we get into the design phase and that kind of thing.

502
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:50,135
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think for the near term, prior to forming the project team, prior to awarding a feasibility study, it makes sense to prioritize substance.

503
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:56,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, I think there's been a good start made by Will's predecessor, Will Welcome.

504
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:00,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I see useful documents there.

505
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think adding the documents that were shared earlier today

506
00:43:05,957 --> 00:43:07,518
[SPEAKER_11]: is a continuation of that pattern.

507
00:43:07,978 --> 00:43:28,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I think building out, you know, the content and having a good starting point for when it's taken over by sort of a more resourced and, you know, a contractor in that field should be our goal.

508
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:30,686
[SPEAKER_11]: So just expressing an opinion.

509
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:33,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thank you for that.

510
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions, comments, thoughts about the website?

511
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,022
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's just been, you know, quiet at the moment.

512
00:43:41,442 --> 00:43:41,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Maria?

513
00:43:42,143 --> 00:43:42,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

514
00:43:43,644 --> 00:43:47,306
[SPEAKER_12]: At one point, we did talk about having some kind of a video.

515
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:58,433
[SPEAKER_12]: And I did speak with the instructors that are in our film and TV production classes at the Vogue.

516
00:43:58,853 --> 00:44:00,274
[SPEAKER_12]: And they are very excited about...

517
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:10,981
[SPEAKER_12]: having the students involved in possibly doing a tour of the school, showing some of the deficits that might help our case in selling this to the public.

518
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:24,009
[SPEAKER_12]: And as far as a timeline, I told them that I felt that it was a little bit away, a distance away where we'd need that, but they're excited to get started now so that it gives them plenty of time to...

519
00:44:24,713 --> 00:44:52,380
[SPEAKER_12]: include things to um you know work with us on what we want to see what you want to see um on that in that film as well so they they are a go and they're excited about it um so i was very very happy about that great have you seen the old one uh the one from 1970 the year the school opened yes that is that's amazing it's funny too so i will um i will

520
00:44:53,550 --> 00:45:12,822
[SPEAKER_15]: take a look through some of the model OPM procurement documents to figure out where do they fit, I guess I'll say, in the process of doing some of this work around PR, just to make sure that we have sort of an understanding of that.

521
00:45:12,882 --> 00:45:17,105
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't think there's really any reason why they couldn't get started in advance of that.

522
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,165
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to double check.

523
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:20,807
[SPEAKER_15]: And Maria, I will follow up with you and let you know.

524
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:25,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

525
00:45:26,162 --> 00:45:36,530
[SPEAKER_15]: So the other thing I wanted to sort of circle back to that we talked about back in June was two updates, two surveys that we were going to do.

526
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,852
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanted to sort of bring Will into the fold.

527
00:45:39,953 --> 00:45:45,117
[SPEAKER_15]: We had some conversation about doing a survey to all of our boards and commissions.

528
00:45:45,157 --> 00:45:50,180
[SPEAKER_15]: So Medford has like, I don't know, 20 or 30 boards and commissions, Will.

529
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:53,383
[SPEAKER_15]: And they all have different, probably different

530
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:59,644
[SPEAKER_15]: sort of attachments and levels of interest in the high school project.

531
00:46:00,602 --> 00:46:04,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Some probably have a very high interest in a lot of things about the project.

532
00:46:04,623 --> 00:46:09,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Others may have, you know, just sort of fleeting interest or want to know different things.

533
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:22,049
[SPEAKER_15]: So we did talk about creating a survey for the boards and commissions to try to get a feel for and an understanding of like where best to plug them all into the process.

534
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,051
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanted to check in with this group.

535
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:26,971
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually think.

536
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:31,594
[SPEAKER_15]: now is good timing to put that survey together.

537
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:43,544
[SPEAKER_15]: And we do have questions from our last meeting and give them some time in the next like six weeks or so to get back to us so that we can be prepared with that information.

538
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:53,873
[SPEAKER_15]: On the flip side, the FAQ survey, I have a little bit of a different opinion about, but I wanted to talk to this group about that timing and whether you think that's like the right timing for boards and commissions.

539
00:46:54,980 --> 00:47:01,687
[SPEAKER_15]: and whether there's like any reason for us not to pursue that sort of in the next like two months or so.

540
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:07,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to clarify the scope of the interaction with the boards and commissions.

541
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:19,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you intend to engage with them in a structured way where you prepare a questionnaire ahead of time or is it more organic?

542
00:47:19,557 --> 00:47:21,979
[SPEAKER_11]: where you go to them and you ask, do you have any questions?

543
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:23,601
[SPEAKER_11]: You record the responses.

544
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:32,929
[SPEAKER_11]: You do that for all the boards and commissions, see what comes up over and over and do your best to answer the questions.

545
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:42,858
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we actually had established some questions in one of our last meetings to actually push out a formal survey so that we can get some standard responses.

546
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:46,020
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think if I'm remembering correctly, one of the questions is,

547
00:47:47,236 --> 00:47:51,398
[SPEAKER_15]: do you want somebody from the building committee to come present to you about the project?

548
00:47:52,718 --> 00:47:53,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Would that be helpful for you?

549
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,260
[SPEAKER_15]: And if so, what is your meeting schedule and that kind of thing?

550
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:09,585
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we'll have to do some descriptor of what we see the process as so that they can say, this is how I think I can be helpful to this project or this is the kind of...

551
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:13,366
[SPEAKER_15]: input or place in the process that I would like to.

552
00:48:13,426 --> 00:48:18,387
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's questions like that to help us frame when we should be reaching out to them.

553
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:19,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Does that make sense?

554
00:48:19,968 --> 00:48:34,732
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, we'll welcome their other questions, but it is like a defined survey set of four or five questions so that we can get a consistent response from them and then figure out how we proceed once we have it.

555
00:48:34,752 --> 00:48:37,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like a copy of the questions.

556
00:48:39,801 --> 00:48:41,942
[SPEAKER_11]: I may have seen them before, but it's, you know.

557
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think we talked about them in our last meeting.

558
00:48:45,264 --> 00:48:47,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.

559
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:53,968
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we can certainly pull those back up and Will and I will work on that and put something together.

560
00:48:53,988 --> 00:49:01,832
[SPEAKER_15]: And Will, we will send a copy to this group so that you know what those questions are.

561
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:03,593
[SPEAKER_15]: And if there's any comments, you can let us know.

562
00:49:04,854 --> 00:49:05,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're in, yeah.

563
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:11,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm attached on the document, so I got them right in front of me.

564
00:49:11,437 --> 00:49:12,779
[SPEAKER_07]: They're on the notes from the last meeting, right?

565
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:13,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

566
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:18,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm looking at them right now.

567
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:19,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

568
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:20,852
[SPEAKER_07]: They make sense to me.

569
00:49:25,264 --> 00:49:31,549
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the timing is very good, too, because people are just gearing up in the fall season.

570
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:34,671
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think everybody is inundated yet.

571
00:49:35,091 --> 00:49:40,035
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you give them a relatively short time, a turnaround time.

572
00:49:41,055 --> 00:49:45,697
[SPEAKER_12]: I think when I say relatively short, I think six weeks is probably a little long.

573
00:49:47,818 --> 00:50:00,804
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, then the results would be in before people start to worry about the holidays coming and, you know, groups that meet every other month, you know, that may have to delay things for that reason as well.

574
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:05,386
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the speed of how you're looking at it.

575
00:50:10,186 --> 00:50:16,754
[SPEAKER_15]: The other survey that we talked about was a survey around the FAQs.

576
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:22,020
[SPEAKER_15]: So really to start to ask the community, what are the kinds of questions you have about this project?

577
00:50:27,245 --> 00:50:41,068
[SPEAKER_15]: given that we have a lot of other like hot topics related to schools going on in the community right now, I'm of the mind that we should defer pushing that survey out until like mid to late November.

578
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:54,251
[SPEAKER_15]: And that with a goal of, you know, being able to put some of those FAQs up by the end of the year, I think it will get lost in the noise if we try to do anything sooner than that.

579
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:55,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Does everyone agree with that approach?

580
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:04,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, yeah, not only will it get lost in noise, but I would assume we would get people saying they want answers to questions related to the other things happening.

581
00:51:04,503 --> 00:51:06,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, I think so too.

582
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:08,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think there'd be a lot of entanglement.

583
00:51:08,964 --> 00:51:17,707
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do think that having a community-sourced FAQ is a better choice for many reasons than...

584
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:28,648
[SPEAKER_11]: more of a directed FAQ where we just kind of cut and paste from other school building project pages and kind of make a super list.

585
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:34,050
[SPEAKER_11]: That's more of us talking to people or instructing people.

586
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:37,911
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think that that's really what people want.

587
00:51:39,111 --> 00:51:46,714
[SPEAKER_11]: I think having the survey and truly pulsing community service is the best foundation for the FAQs.

588
00:51:46,754 --> 00:51:48,034
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree with your timing.

589
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:50,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool, so we'll...

590
00:51:54,758 --> 00:52:01,663
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, roughly speaking, we'll plan to meet at some point after, like, in the mid-November timeframe.

591
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:08,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we can, like, Will and I, Will can draft up the survey to be able to push out.

592
00:52:08,648 --> 00:52:11,810
[SPEAKER_15]: We can review it together and then make a plan to push it out.

593
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:20,375
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think for this group, maybe the next time we meet can be, you know, mid to late November, like mid-November-ish, post-election.

594
00:52:20,396 --> 00:52:24,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Does that work for everybody?

595
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm hmm.

596
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:27,401
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

597
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes sense to me.

598
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:29,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

599
00:52:31,403 --> 00:52:33,705
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the other thing that I do think.

600
00:52:36,212 --> 00:52:51,781
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like for us to work on, and it can, it can come from the, I think from the district, maybe as an attachment, Dr. Edouard-Vincent to your weekly email is just an update on where we are, something sort of brief that says we're done with our deliverables.

601
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:53,282
[SPEAKER_15]: You can find them all here.

602
00:52:54,883 --> 00:53:01,126
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, the next step is this, and we await that, you know, we await information from MSPA on taking that next step.

603
00:53:01,266 --> 00:53:02,047
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the meantime,

604
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:06,668
[SPEAKER_15]: we'll be coming to you to solicit questions and stay tuned for that.

605
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:10,591
[SPEAKER_15]: So something along that line so that people have an understanding of what's going on.

606
00:53:11,472 --> 00:53:15,795
[SPEAKER_08]: We can definitely add that to the weekly memo.

607
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:21,880
[SPEAKER_08]: And MSBA is actually doing a new logo contest.

608
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,502
[SPEAKER_08]: So they've been emailing me and our students.

609
00:53:26,463 --> 00:53:51,303
[SPEAKER_08]: they want to rebrand and it's going to be a new logo for msba so our students miss suzanne fee our director of arts is going to be working with students to design potential logos for msba and that's from september 16th until november 22nd so we have such wonderful arts programming i am keeping my fingers crossed

610
00:53:52,003 --> 00:54:00,005
[SPEAKER_08]: that maybe one of our students' designs will be selected for the new logo for MSBA, which would be fabulous for us.

611
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:09,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can definitely put an MSBA update, though, in this week's update, Friday's message.

612
00:54:09,868 --> 00:54:12,368
[SPEAKER_15]: It may not be ready for this week, but maybe next week.

613
00:54:12,388 --> 00:54:13,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, perfect.

614
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:14,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

615
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:17,911
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was it.

616
00:54:17,951 --> 00:54:19,112
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I had for this group.

617
00:54:19,192 --> 00:54:22,573
[SPEAKER_15]: So it actually was a quick short meeting again.

618
00:54:22,613 --> 00:54:23,933
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you guys for joining.

619
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:28,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any other questions before we adjourn?

620
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:32,796
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just wanted to say welcome.

621
00:54:32,816 --> 00:54:34,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm actually also a URI journalism grad.

622
00:54:34,997 --> 00:54:35,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked you up.

623
00:54:35,637 --> 00:54:37,198
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're in good company.
