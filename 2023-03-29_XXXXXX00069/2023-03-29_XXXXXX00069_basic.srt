We, one time, were in an art museum, and then they, my sister, had to start touching things. So she ran around, like, touching, like, the Mona Lisa and stuff. Well, not the Mona Lisa, but very famous paintings, and, like, by Leonardo da Vinci, Vince Van Gogh, and, like, needed to run and wrestle in the hallway. Izzy?

8
00:02:54,788 --> 00:03:14,971
Penny. Well, one time my brother, well, I was in the basement doing my piano practice and my brother thought, I asked him for a snack, so I called him like, Clark, get me a snack that I like. And he brought me cereal.

9
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:32,386
The milk on the piano and everywhere. What the heck? Izzy? During my piano practice, just like Penny, my sister came in, interrupted it, and said a blaggledy bloop right in front of my piano teacher. What the heck?

10
00:03:32,707 --> 00:04:02,677
And for the crazy... And I really don't have a sibling. How do you consider yourself an angel or a devil and how does your sibling consider themselves an angel or a devil? Izzy? I consider myself a devil. Also, I know I didn't say myself. Devil. Do you consider yourself an angel or a devil? Izzy? I consider myself a devil.

11
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:30,520
Anika? Devil. Ava? Devil. Conrad? Just to be separate from all you weirdos, I'm gonna say angel. I am obviously the angel of my family. Penny might not be speaking the truth. I am! I so am! And I consider myself a, and I know this might sound crazy, but I consider myself a devil.

12
00:04:31,330 --> 00:05:00,085
Now, for the next question. Aren't we all devils? Shut up! How would you describe yourself in one word? Izzy. From my sister's perspective, very, very annoying. Annika. Okay, we'll get back to you, Annika. Conrad, speak to the mic.

And I think I would describe myself in one word as... I think I would describe myself as psychotic.

Now, how would you describe your sibling, Izzy? Very stupid and annoying. Izzy, how would you describe your sibling? Very, very stupid and annoying. Ava? Dumb and annoying. Well, probably I would describe my sibling as the worst thing possible. And Clark. I'm just gonna leave.

16
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:35,429
And now me, Clark, my opinion is my sibling might be the weirdest thing ever. Okay, I take mine back. Mine actually is also the weirdest thing ever. Okay, now say the craziest thing your sibling has ever done. Annika!

17
00:06:37,184 --> 00:07:04,522
