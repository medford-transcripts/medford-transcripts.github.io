[SPEAKER_01]: Almost seven, but he's still six.

35
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:25,332
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could describe your sibling in one word, what would you use as the word?

36
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:27,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can't be anything like crazy.

37
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:30,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Annoying.

38
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:32,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously.

39
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:33,434

[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously.

00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:37,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows that.

44
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:38,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupid.

00:01:40,973 --> 00:01:41,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Scoopid.

46
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:43,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, that's the name of our podcast.

47
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:47,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Penny... Awful.

[SPEAKER_01]: Just plain awful.

50
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:55,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, on a scale of 1 to 10 of annoyance, what would you rate them?

51
00:01:56,706 --> 00:01:57,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rate them... 11.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:00,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

55
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rate them 15.

56
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:04,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rate it a 5,000.

00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:24,464
[SPEAKER_01]: okay now is the craziest what is the craziest thing they have ever done to you well this isn't the craziest thing they've done to me but i know it's the craziest thing they've done

58
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:32,811
[SPEAKER_01]: We, one time, were in an art museum, and then they, my sister, had to start touching things.

59
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:36,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So she ran around, like, touching, like, the Mona Lisa and stuff.

60
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:50,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not the Mona Lisa, but very famous paintings, and, like, by Leonardo da Vinci, Vince Van Gogh, and, like, needed to run and wrestle in the hallway.

61
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:50,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Izzy?

62
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Penny.

63
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:11,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one time my brother, well, I was in the basement doing my piano practice and my brother thought, I asked him for a snack, so I called him like, Clark, get me a snack that I like.

64
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:13,589
[SPEAKER_01]: And he brought me cereal.

65
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:18,174
[SPEAKER_01]: The milk on the piano and everywhere.

66
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:20,976
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck?

67
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:21,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Izzy?

68
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:30,805
[SPEAKER_01]: During my piano practice, just like Penny, my sister came in, interrupted it, and said a blaggledy bloop right in front of my piano teacher.

69
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:31,585
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck?

70
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:37,289
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the crazy... And I really don't have a sibling.

71
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:46,412
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you consider yourself an angel or a devil and how does your sibling consider themselves an angel or a devil?

72
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:47,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Izzy?

73
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:50,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider myself a devil.

74
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:53,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I know I didn't say myself.

75
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:54,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Devil.

76
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:58,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you consider yourself an angel or a devil?

77
00:03:59,376 --> 00:03:59,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Izzy?

78
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:02,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider myself a devil.

79
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Anika?

80
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:04,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Devil.

81
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Ava?

82
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Devil.

83
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Conrad?

84
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:14,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be separate from all you weirdos, I'm gonna say angel.

85
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,735
[SPEAKER_01]: I am obviously the angel of my family.

86
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:22,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Penny might not be speaking the truth.

87
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:24,037
[SPEAKER_01]: I am!

88
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:24,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I so am!

89
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:29,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And I consider myself a, and I know this might sound crazy, but I consider myself a devil.

90
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for the next question.

91
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't we all devils?

92
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:34,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up!

93
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:40,775
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe yourself in one word?

94
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:42,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Izzy.

95
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:51,881
[SPEAKER_00]: From my sister's perspective, very, very annoying.

96
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:54,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Annika.

97
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:57,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we'll get back to you, Annika.

98
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:59,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Conrad, speak to the mic.

99
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:04,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is actually spelled M-I-C.

100
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:05,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

101
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:08,773
[SPEAKER_01]: The most amazing thing on the earth!

102
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:12,274
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more than two, that's more than one word.

103
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:14,575
[SPEAKER_01]: That's seven words.

104
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:15,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.

105
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:16,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome!

106
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:21,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Ava, I forgot who... I would say weird.

107
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:24,958
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say, describe yourself in one word?

108
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:25,018
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

109
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:26,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.

110
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,519
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to stop that.

111
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,179
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't stop.

112
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Weird!

113
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:42,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I would describe myself in one word as... I think I would describe myself as psychotic.

114
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:46,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how would you describe your sibling, Izzy?

115
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Very stupid and annoying.

116
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:53,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Izzy, how would you describe your sibling?

117
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very stupid and annoying.

118
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:57,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Ava?

119
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Dumb and annoying.

120
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:07,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, probably I would describe my sibling as the worst thing possible.

121
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:09,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And Clark.

122
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just gonna leave.

123
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:19,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And now me, Clark, my opinion is my sibling might be the weirdest thing ever.

124
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:22,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I take mine back.

125
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine actually is also the weirdest thing ever.

126
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:33,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now say the craziest thing your sibling has ever done.

127
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:34,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Annika!

128
00:06:37,284 --> 00:06:40,186
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe your sibling in love on a scale of 1 to 10?

129
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:42,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can't just be like a negative 50.

130
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:11,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Izzy, how would you describe your sibling on a scale of 1 to 10 in love?

131
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:13,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Who ripped our sticker?

132
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Who?

133
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you?

134
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:19,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I did.

135
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:24,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, it's not ripped.

136
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:29,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Izzy, how would you describe your sibling in love on a scale of 1 to 10?

137
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:29,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Izzy?

138
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero.

139
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:33,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Conrad?

140
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:40,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Five.

[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a sibling.

[SPEAKER_01]: Eleven because... actually no.

148
00:07:56,504 --> 00:08:05,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten because she loves... Because she loves me too much that she copies me every second of the day.

00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:15,326
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best part is,

161
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:18,047
[SPEAKER_01]: It will never break.

162
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,028
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might be wondering, well, what does this do?

163
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:26,649
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing as the other one, except we can change out stuff inside of it and our siblings can wear it.

164
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:37,671
[SPEAKER_01]: But the difference is, your sibling will be so stunned you put a diaper on them, full of fake, slimy goo and everything like that, that they won't move.

165
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll just be quiet for the rest of...

166
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:43,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Three seconds.
