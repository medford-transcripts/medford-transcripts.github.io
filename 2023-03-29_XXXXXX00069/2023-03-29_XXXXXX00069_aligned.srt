00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:07,418
This is the Stupid Siblings Show.

2
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,943
A podcast about moments with siblings.

3
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:15,366
Siblings, the uncontrollable annoyance of your life.

4
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:20,903
Whether they're older, younger, twin, or triplet, they will be annoying.

5
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:22,883
And we're here to talk about that.

6
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:24,983
Penny, age nine.

7
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:26,684
Conrad, age 10.

8
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:27,884
Izzy, age 10.

9
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:29,384
Juniper, age 10.

10
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:34,885
Annika, nine and a half.

11
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:39,266
So, what is your sibling's name?

12
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:39,886
Annika.

13
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:40,886
Maggie.

14
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:41,386
Izzy.

15
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:43,827
Willa and Ava.

16
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:44,827
Penny.

17
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:47,766
Um, Clark.

18
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:53,189
What is the gender of your sibling?

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,850
Annika?

20
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:54,630
Girl.

21
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:55,791
Girl.

22
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:56,692
Penny?

23
00:00:56,852 --> 00:00:57,472
Clark!

24
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:00,494
The gender of your sibling?

25
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:01,755
Clark!

26
00:01:02,516 --> 00:01:04,437
Okay, boy, boy, come on.

27
00:01:04,577 --> 00:01:05,077
Okay.

28
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:07,699
How old is your sibling?

29
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:09,280
How old is your sibling?

30
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,841
A tiny bit over seven.

31
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:11,742
Ozzy?

32
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,931
Two for Willa and six for Ava.

33
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:17,611
Okay, and Penny?

34
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:20,971
Almost seven, but he's still six.

35
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:25,332
If you could describe your sibling in one word, what would you use as the word?

36
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:27,213
And it can't be anything like crazy.

37
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:30,793
Annoying.

38
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:32,394
Obviously.

39
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:33,434
Stupid.

40
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:34,754
Obviously.

41
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:35,534
Annoying.

42
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:36,855
Obviously.

43
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:37,975
Everyone knows that.

44
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:38,975
Stupid.

45
00:01:40,973 --> 00:01:41,594
Scoopid.

46
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:43,855
Obviously, that's the name of our podcast.

47
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:47,198
Now, Penny... Awful.

48
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,160
Congratulations.

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,141
Just plain awful.

50
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:55,725
Okay, on a scale of 1 to 10 of annoyance, what would you rate them?

51
00:01:56,706 --> 00:01:57,666
I would rate them... 11.

52
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:58,167
Pass.

53
00:01:58,627 --> 00:01:59,208
Okay.

54
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:00,669
Okay.

55
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,270
I would rate them 15.

56
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:04,132
I would rate it a 5,000.

57
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:24,464
okay now is the craziest what is the craziest thing they have ever done to you well this isn't the craziest thing they've done to me but i know it's the craziest thing they've done

58
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:32,811
We, one time, were in an art museum, and then they, my sister, had to start touching things.

59
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:36,892
So she ran around, like, touching, like, the Mona Lisa and stuff.

60
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:50,414
Well, not the Mona Lisa, but very famous paintings, and, like, by Leonardo da Vinci, Vince Van Gogh, and, like, needed to run and wrestle in the hallway.

61
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:50,514
Izzy?

62
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,549
Penny.

63
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:11,767
Well, one time my brother, well, I was in the basement doing my piano practice and my brother thought, I asked him for a snack, so I called him like, Clark, get me a snack that I like.

64
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:13,589
And he brought me cereal.

65
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:18,174
The milk on the piano and everywhere.

66
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:20,976
What the heck?

67
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:21,076
Izzy?

68
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:30,805
During my piano practice, just like Penny, my sister came in, interrupted it, and said a blaggledy bloop right in front of my piano teacher.

69
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:31,585
What the heck?

70
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:37,289
And for the crazy... And I really don't have a sibling.

71
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:46,412
How do you consider yourself an angel or a devil and how does your sibling consider themselves an angel or a devil?

72
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:47,232
Izzy?

73
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:50,673
I consider myself a devil.

74
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:53,914
Also, I know I didn't say myself.

75
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:54,554
Devil.

76
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:58,596
Do you consider yourself an angel or a devil?

77
00:03:59,376 --> 00:03:59,716
Izzy?

78
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:02,437
I consider myself a devil.

79
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,769
Anika?

80
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:04,389
Devil.

81
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,430
Ava?

82
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,091
Devil.

83
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,251
Conrad?

84
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:14,213
Just to be separate from all you weirdos, I'm gonna say angel.

85
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,735
I am obviously the angel of my family.

86
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:22,157
Penny might not be speaking the truth.

87
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:24,037
I am!

88
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:24,257
I so am!

89
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:29,640
And I consider myself a, and I know this might sound crazy, but I consider myself a devil.

90
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,691
Now, for the next question.

91
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,671
Aren't we all devils?

92
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:34,252
Shut up!

93
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:40,775
How would you describe yourself in one word?

94
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:42,876
Izzy.

95
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:51,881
From my sister's perspective, very, very annoying.

96
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:54,262
Annika.

97
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:57,504
Okay, we'll get back to you, Annika.

98
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:59,705
Conrad, speak to the mic.

99
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:04,132
Mike is actually spelled M-I-C.

100
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:05,392
I know.

101
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:08,773
The most amazing thing on the earth!

102
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:12,274
That's more than two, that's more than one word.

103
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:14,575
That's seven words.

104
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:15,255
Fine.

105
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:16,896
Awesome!

106
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:21,077
Ava, I forgot who... I would say weird.

107
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:24,958
What would you say, describe yourself in one word?

108
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:25,018
No!

109
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:26,679
Come on.

110
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,519
We need to stop that.

111
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,179
No, we don't stop.

112
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,499
Weird!

113
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:42,382
And I think I would describe myself in one word as... I think I would describe myself as psychotic.

114
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:46,915
Now, how would you describe your sibling, Izzy?

115
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,336
Very stupid and annoying.

116
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:53,877
Izzy, how would you describe your sibling?

117
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,639
Very, very stupid and annoying.

118
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:57,499
Ava?

119
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,619
Dumb and annoying.

120
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:07,923
Well, probably I would describe my sibling as the worst thing possible.

121
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:09,624
And Clark.

122
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,325
I'm just gonna leave.

123
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:19,836
And now me, Clark, my opinion is my sibling might be the weirdest thing ever.

124
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:22,919
Okay, I take mine back.

125
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,061
Mine actually is also the weirdest thing ever.

126
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:33,908
Okay, now say the craziest thing your sibling has ever done.

127
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:34,849
Annika!

128
00:06:37,284 --> 00:06:40,186
How would you describe your sibling in love on a scale of 1 to 10?

129
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:42,327
And it can't just be like a negative 50.

130
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:11,986
Izzy, how would you describe your sibling on a scale of 1 to 10 in love?

131
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:13,907
Who ripped our sticker?

132
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,950
Who?

133
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,130
Are you?

134
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:19,612
Oh, I did.

135
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:24,555
And by the way, it's not ripped.

136
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:29,119
Izzy, how would you describe your sibling in love on a scale of 1 to 10?

137
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:29,539
Izzy?

138
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,661
Zero.

139
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:33,302
Conrad?

140
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:40,761
Five.

141
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,701
Anika?

142
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,342
You don't have a sibling.

143
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:47,162
I don't care.

144
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:51,043
I answered for you.

145
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:51,103
Ha.

146
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,383
Anika?

147
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:56,484
Eleven because... actually no.

148
00:07:56,504 --> 00:08:05,786
Ten because she loves... Because she loves me too much that she copies me every second of the day.

149
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:06,866
Quit it!

150
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:20,216
isn't it called like there's a word for that tobycat no it's like an actual like an actual good one that big kids use i'm older you know and ava

151
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:23,298
Clark is a seven.

152
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:27,061
I'm three and I hate my sister because well my sister smells like farts.

153
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:27,721
I'm six and

154
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:53,823
I think my sister is an alien.

155
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,468
Don't tell her that.

156
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:29,870
do you ever wish you could just slap your sibling in the face with a diapy then look no further the slappy diapy it's a diaper that you can just slap your sibling with with fake poop and pee inside so you're walking through the house your siblings trying to hit you normal day but then you whip around and slap it and it's in the face of your sibling is the slappy diapy

157
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:48,205
now if that's not all for you and if you don't just want to slap your sibling in the face and you want to put that diaper on them but that diapers sealed full of fake stuff well guess what our newest model the real diapy

158
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:57,713
It is something that you can fill with an assortment of gross items that comes with every purchase.

159
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:12,764
If you just send us their shoe size, shirt size, most likely underwear size, any size, then we can get you a perfectly fitting diaper to put in their face, head, butt, anywhere else.

160
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:15,326
And the best part is,

161
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:18,047
It will never break.

162
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,028
And you might be wondering, well, what does this do?

163
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:26,649
It's the same thing as the other one, except we can change out stuff inside of it and our siblings can wear it.

164
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:37,671
But the difference is, your sibling will be so stunned you put a diaper on them, full of fake, slimy goo and everything like that, that they won't move.

165
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,692
And they'll just be quiet for the rest of...

166
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:43,732
Three seconds.
