00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:05,476
Thank you to Alex for being here and I just want to say that you know this mixture of humanity and

2
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:33,148
The, the opportunity to serve, you know, comes right from our personal experience and I've been so inspired by Anna's work and her commitment to democracy and Aaron's sort of sense of call to service and volunteerism.

3
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:34,843
And that's why we're here.

4
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:40,844
And so I thank all of you and the spirit that makes community for that opportunity.

5
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:41,725
So thank you.

6
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:45,345
And thank you, Alex, for just giving us a chance to all be in the video.

7
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:45,725
Yay!

8
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:48,426
Say yay!

9
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:48,626
Yay!

10
00:00:48,686 --> 00:00:50,926
Now I'm going to hand it over to you.

11
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:52,387
I gave him what he wanted.

12
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:57,428
So I just want to speak for a couple of minutes about what has inspired me to

13
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:04,904
here this evening to support these amazing candidates.

14
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:11,510
I'm going to go out on a limb and say I'm probably the most recent citizen of Medford here.

15
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,252
My husband, Bob, and I moved here 11 weeks ago.

16
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:19,837
So what has me here instead of unpacking boxes?

17
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:23,620
And I will tell you, it is these two amazing candidates.

18
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:25,742
They actually, Aaron and I,

19
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:30,479
go way back to here, I'll share you those stories if you're curious, come and find me later.

20
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:39,046
But I was thrilled to, I'm gonna go with reintroduced because you're quite the man.

21
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:50,975
And so when I first moved to town a couple weeks ago, bumped into Wendy, had an opportunity to meet Erin, I was just struck by this 23 year old man,

22
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:56,468
who went through the school system in Medford.

23
00:01:56,808 --> 00:02:01,190
And I don't know about you, but when I was 23, I was very egocentric.

24
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,752
I was thinking about what was next for me and what my life was.

25
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:14,637
And here's a man who, at 23, after graduating college, looks outward and says, how can I pay back?

26
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:20,359
What can I do for everything that I got from the Medford school system?

27
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:24,675
please spend some time and get to know him.

28
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:32,738
And he will, I'm sure, speak about his vision for educational justice and education for all in the town of Medford.

29
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:38,920
You will find him to be intelligent, creative, and inspirational.

30
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,922
Through Aaron and Wendy, I was privileged enough to meet Anna.

31
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:49,704
Of course, I jumped on her website after first meeting her.

32
00:02:50,171 --> 00:03:06,545
And I will tell you, as a past engineer, what I was struck by on her website was, first of all, all of her experience, which you will most likely speak to, and her platform, her push for democracy.

33
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,067
You'll hear about that from her.

34
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:15,513
But she comes from an engineering background and is a data-driven research person.

35
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:21,685
And in these days and times, I'm sure you've all heard anecdotal arguments from many a people.

36
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:29,969
You've heard from your internet and sources, all kinds of facts and statistics trying to convince you to do different things.

37
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:39,613
It is in the actual data and research that we can find the way to move forward in a creative and a way that makes sense.

38
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:44,796
She's got a lot of experience about exploring not just other towns and other

39
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:55,928
ways of being and moving democracy forward in the country, but she has a very broad view of being curious about what can be done to make a difference.

40
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:00,010
So between those two things, I'm like, some boxes will get unpacked another time.

41
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:14,855
So it is my hope that you engage with them this evening, learn all you can about them, and please, at the end of the evening, support them in any way you can with your talents, time, and financial resources as you see fit.
