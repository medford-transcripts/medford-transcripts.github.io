1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:02,673
Regular meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:02,954 --> 00:00:05,456
We're going to take a quick roll call and then we'll get started.

3
00:00:07,197 --> 00:00:07,898
Jim Tirani?

4
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:09,459
Present.

5
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:11,101
Yvette Velez?

6
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:12,482
Present.

7
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:14,083
Andre LaRue?

8
00:00:14,944 --> 00:00:15,324
Present.

9
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:16,825
Mary Lee?

10
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:17,866
Present.

11
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:20,489
Chris Diabetta?

12
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:22,891
I don't see him on yet.

13
00:00:25,352 --> 00:00:27,534
And then Mike Caldera present.

14
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:30,096
So we have five members present.

15
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:35,761
I will be appointing Mary as a voting member.

16
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:36,862
Oh, OK.

17
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,463
I think Chris just joined.

18
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:41,726
So maybe it will be a case-by-case basis.

19
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:45,549
I'll just wait a moment.

20
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:48,551
All right, we're just in the process of taking roll call.

21
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:51,654
I'm going to call on Chris D'Avetta.

22
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:53,457
Present.

23
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:54,578
OK, great.

24
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:55,919
So we've got six.

25
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:07,325
Folks, so before we get started on the standard business, once per year, the zoning board elects a chair for the next year.

26
00:01:07,345 --> 00:01:10,687
And so we're going to be doing that at the start of this meeting.

27
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:17,691
The way that's going to work, any member of the board is welcome to nominate a member as chair.

28
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:20,593
And then that will require a second.

29
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:23,996
There can be multiple nominations.

30
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:30,262
Anyone nominated will indicate whether they accept the nomination or not, and then we'll vote on our next chair.

31
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:41,052
So with that being said, Dennis, is there any lead-in you need to do, or can we just go straight to the voting procedure?

32
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:43,614
No, we can still do that.

33
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:44,295
Hold on.

34
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:45,776
Some folks are not muted.

35
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:47,518
Yeah, I just muted you.

36
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:48,258
I can't hear.

37
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:51,776
Yeah, okay, I think we should be good now.

38
00:01:51,916 --> 00:02:01,940
So yeah, acting chair awaits a motion for who to nominate as our chair for the next year.

39
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:04,681
Motion to nominate?

40
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:07,162
Mary, can I nominate?

41
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,263
Yeah, who are you nominating, Mary?

42
00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:11,144
I'm nominating Mike.

43
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,685
Okay, do I have a second?

44
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:16,454
Second.

45
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:19,196
OK, second from Chris.

46
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:23,478
Any other motions to nominate a member?

47
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:31,283
OK, I do not see any.

48
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:36,546
I am willing to accept the nomination, so why don't we go ahead and vote.

49
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:41,128
So Jim Tirani?

50
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:42,189
Aye.

51
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,730
Yvette Velez?

52
00:02:46,548 --> 00:02:46,688
Aye.

53
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:48,149
Andre LaRue.

54
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:49,230
Aye.

55
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,770
Mary Lee.

56
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:51,631
Aye.

57
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:53,212
Christy Aveda.

58
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:54,552
Aye.

59
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:57,954
Mike Caldera, I'm going to abstain.

60
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:03,777
So I am now the chair, not the acting chair.

61
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,258
So I will rename myself on Zoom.

62
00:03:05,278 --> 00:03:08,720
All right.

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,701
Thank you for your patience, folks.

64
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:14,406
So we are going to take one item out of order.

65
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:18,229
I think the board got a request to withdraw.

66
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:19,049
Is that right, Dennis?

67
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,291
That is correct.

68
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:26,255
We received a request from the applicant for 106 Alexander Avenue to withdraw.

69
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:27,977
OK.

70
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:31,039
So let's read 106 Alexander Avenue.

71
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:35,423
106 Alexander Avenue, applicant and owner,

72
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:49,121
to demolish an existing single-family home at 106 Alexander Avenue, replacing a two-family home in a general residence zoning district, which is an allowed use with insufficient lot area and lot width, per the City Measures Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

73
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:52,203
All right, thank you, Dennis.

74
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:55,024
Do we have a representative for the applicant?

75
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:58,146
I know we have a request to withdraw in writing.

76
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:02,828
I don't believe they're on the call.

77
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,509
We just received a formal letter

78
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:07,202
You know, into the office.

79
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:12,945
Okay, yeah, or sorry that the board hasn't heard any testimony on the matter.

80
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:17,727
So, customarily, if an applicant request to withdraw, we, we grant it.

81
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:21,569
Happy to discuss as a board.

82
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:23,890
Otherwise chair awaits a motion.

83
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:26,431
Should we even need to vote on it?

84
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:26,752
Dennis?

85
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:27,372
Or is it just.

86
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:31,499
We didn't open the case, I think we can just dispose of it.

87
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,081
Yeah, I think we can just not open it.

88
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:46,646
But just because if there are folks here who are here who received a notice on this, just to let you all know that if the applicant decides to go forward again, they'll have to go through the exact same process and you will get notified again.

89
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:50,208
So this isn't like kicking the can down the road and waiting.

90
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:57,331
If they wish to come before the zoning board again, it'll be the exact same process and you'll receive a notice in the mail stating

91
00:04:58,377 --> 00:04:59,797
that this is what they are seeking to do.

92
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:03,858
But currently, that matter is not going to be heard.

93
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,559
OK, yeah, so we've never opened it.

94
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,140
We don't need to vote for it to be withdrawn.

95
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,540
So the matter is withdrawn.

96
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,220
OK.

97
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:20,922
So next item on the agenda, Dennis.

98
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,903
85 Elm Street, continued from January 30, 2025.

99
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:50,113
To demolish and convert a legal nonconforming motor vehicle repair station to a three-unit townhouse style residential building in a single-family two-zoning district, requiring a variance of frontage, lot width, and usable open space per the City Metro Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B. As a variance as to parking pursuant to Chapter 94, 6.1.3, a variance as to use pursuant to Chapter 94, 11.4.2, or alternatively, a special permit to change a nonconforming use as set forth in Chapter 94, 5.21.

100
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:53,522
All right, thank you, Dennis.

101
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:56,544
So this matter was continued from a prior meeting.

102
00:05:57,544 --> 00:06:06,508
My recollection is that the voting members and the members who were present when we heard that case were myself, Chip.

103
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:12,330
I don't hear anything.

104
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:36,211
to that vocal, but as Andre LaRue and Mary Lee, oh, do you mind?

105
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:38,329
I think my connection cut out.

106
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:39,649
Can folks hear me now?

107
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:40,570
I think my connection cut out.

108
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,790
OK, great.

109
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:42,431
Sorry about that.

110
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:43,091
So yeah.

111
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:51,356
So just to be clear, myself, Jim, Yvette, Andre, Mary were present before, so they will be the voting members.

112
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:56,719
I believe we got all the way to deliberation, and then there was a request to continue.

113
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:06,264
And so I think just because the applicant does intend to present additional information, we'll plan to reopen public comment.

114
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,821
on the new information, just in case there is any.

115
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:15,985
So yeah, with that being said, I see we have Attorney Desmond for the applicant.

116
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:33,136
Just as a matter of procedure, where we had before five members and the prior chair was available to vote, and we now have four under the Mullen rule, is the other regular member permitted at this point to hear?

117
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:37,845
hear testimony, especially where we're reopening the matter.

118
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:45,249
I don't know if that has read in, but there were five members when we originally were before the board to vote.

119
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:46,229
Oh yeah.

120
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:50,351
So attorney Desmond, I may be misremembering, but um, I double checked.

121
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:58,254
So this was the January meeting and I know at the start we were, Jamie was not present and it was the five I mentioned.

122
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:00,315
That was a motion for continuance.

123
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,257
That wasn't when the actual hearing was held.

124
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:03,737
The hearing

125
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:16,893
was in December, and then we continued it in January for purposes of obtaining the expert opinion, because if you recall, I had filed the motion to continue one of the partners, yes.

126
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:18,994
Okay, okay, thanks for the reminder.

127
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:26,539
So your proposal is that under the Mullen rule, I appoint one of Yvette or Chris, is that right?

128
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:33,764
Well, Yvette's a regular member, so I believe she's ready to be able to vote.

129
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:36,194
There wouldn't be another alternative.

130
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:37,996
Yeah, sounds good.

131
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:42,819
So, Yvette, we heard this matter in December.

132
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:53,227
Under the Mullen rule, you would have had to review the kind of the prior testimony or the notes from that session to vote.

133
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:55,629
Have you had a chance to review that?

134
00:08:57,611 --> 00:08:59,432
I have looked at the documents.

135
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:00,273
Okay.

136
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:01,898
Okay, great.

137
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:04,000
So then yes, so that will be voting.

138
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,720
So we have five.

139
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:07,062
Thanks for the catch.

140
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:07,722
Attorney Desmond.

141
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:08,222
All right.

142
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:13,646
Um, so yeah, so as I understand it, you have some new information that you'd like to share with the board.

143
00:09:14,226 --> 00:09:15,227
That's correct.

144
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:21,491
Um, as you as you know, this is a situation where we're proposing three unit townhouse

145
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,956
The parcel's in an SF2 district.

146
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:25,937
It's a 10,000 square foot parcel of land.

147
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:45,826
If you may recall, it's hampered by a 12-foot drainage easement that diagonally runs across the front of the property, requiring that any building be 4 feet from the street, and then the topographical issues to the back that require retaining walls and whatnot in order to proceed on this.

148
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:56,694
We were hoping to have Michael Tushet with us, but there was some miscommunication as to his understanding of when the meeting was.

149
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:57,855
And he's actually on a plane.

150
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:00,557
If he wasn't on a plane right now, he would be here.

151
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:08,483
But he did submit a written statement to the board as to what the site plan costs would be for the project.

152
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:13,166
And if need be, Dennis, can I share my screen?

153
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:21,676
If the board had questions and wanted him present, he could be present at the following meeting.

154
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:35,505
But given that we had continued this once, I wanted to at least present the information that he's presented to us with respect to the costs associated with the project.

155
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:44,091
In addition, I believe Mary had a question concerning the trees and actually the distance between

156
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:48,809
Here's the abiding house and the proposed project.

157
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:57,912
She had asked that we remove the trees, I think, so that she could actually gauge the distance between the two structures.

158
00:10:58,692 --> 00:10:59,872
And we have done that.

159
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:01,593
Let me show you that rendering.

160
00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:06,534
So here's the rendering, which shows the distance without the trees.

161
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:13,716
You know, the intent is certainly to keep a greenscape here so that there is a buffer.

162
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:20,282
between the adjacent homeowner and the condominium.

163
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:26,865
But as you can see, it's, I believe it's, let me go back to my, because I did not look at this earlier today, that piece of it.

164
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:37,212
I believe it's roughly 20 feet between the existing structure and the other house.

165
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:56,704
I can get to the scroll down for some reason I don't just so I can get the exact and put a bunch of things in here so that I could talk about them.

166
00:11:56,724 --> 00:12:01,948
Okay, so here we are.

167
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:12,195
So the distance between the house as proposed is 14 feet within our property and then there's another at least 10 feet

168
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:16,186
between the lot line and the adjacent property.

169
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:18,867
So the distance is 24 feet.

170
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:42,080
As we had discussed, if this lot were able to be subdivided, which it isn't because of the width issue, you would have a much closer structure to this because you'd need to observe the seven and a half feet on both sides of the property as opposed to the three unit townhouse,

171
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:44,423
situation.

172
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:48,384
So you would actually be closer to that house just by necessity.

173
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:56,445
Um, and thereby, you know, exacerbating, um, the, um, the concerns that the neighbor had next to the property.

174
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:12,848
Um, so, so that I, I hope addresses, um, the questions that Mary had with respect to the distance between the properties, um, with respect to the cost component, um,

175
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:30,366
Mister to shed I brought broke down what the cost would be for each of the the cost associated with construction of site construction not not construction of the dwellings and and he indicates.

176
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:39,309
That you know the sewer water sewer and drainage is going to cost approximately $207,000 to complete

177
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:45,367
The landscape paving and excavation would be approximately $180,000.

178
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,108
The retaining walls he anticipates to be in the vicinity of, I'm sorry, yeah, $80,000.

179
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:49,269
So the total site work that he

180
00:13:58,242 --> 00:14:10,765
sees this project requiring, based on the topography and also the drainage, because you're going to have to bring water much farther than you would if you could move the structures closer, is $474,000.

181
00:14:11,386 --> 00:14:15,727
And that's just the site work.

182
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:25,489
Divided by two, that's going to create a situation where you, before you even begin construction of the dwellings, you're going to have a $237,000

183
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:29,816
site cost per dwelling unit.

184
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:43,780
If that's spread out over three, it's a $79,000 difference, which brings it down to $158,000 per unit for site work.

185
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:57,385
He also opines about the other costs, which he doesn't include in his breakdown, which would include permits and police details

186
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:10,119
He doesn't include the soft costs for condo fees, condominium association documents, fees associated with building plans that have to be put together.

187
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,444
And he also doesn't include in his, because he was not going to be responsible for it, the demolition costs.

188
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:22,329
So my client can speak to the demolition costs, but he believes those to be in the vicinity of $50,000.

189
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:36,204
I think the soft costs, if you take the permits and the connectivity fees and the police details, the permit itself, I think my client anticipates to be around $30,000 plus a connectivity fee.

190
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:43,410
You've got final plans for the buildings themselves, engineering plans, mechanical plans.

191
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:50,976
So all of that rolled in in terms of the soft costs, I think it's fair to say would be in the vicinity of $80,000, somewhere in that.

192
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:57,349
vicinity in addition to the demolition costs.

193
00:15:57,849 --> 00:16:04,873
And then, you know, you would have broker's fees and off the top of any sales price of that as well.

194
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:12,378
And if you took, he also put in, also gave us a sense as to in terms of construction,

195
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:35,811
that the cost and it would include include site work that that typically that you know the average type cost is 320 per square foot for a single family the townhouses because you can share some of the foundation the exterior walls and and and there's some lessening of cost there he put that at 250 I know

196
00:16:37,890 --> 00:17:03,452
see brown seems to think that that would maybe a higher cost that would be required to to to accommodate the site costs and also the construction costs but you know I think in terms of looking at it from a chat perspective and and and focusing really on you know what the site work does in in terms of

197
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:30,353
being split between three units versus two units if you were to say and if you were to be able to build a 2,500 square foot unit which is what this is a 250 square foot you construction cost would be 625 and as you can see here you know 61% on a two unit dwelling is is

198
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:49,909
attributable to site work versus construction allowance which would be 388 which which may very well raise the the you know the the square foot the dollar per square foot cost whereas with the three units you've got your site work down to $158,000 and then you've got a construction allowance of 467

199
00:17:54,866 --> 00:18:11,574
If you add in the soft costs and the broker's commissions, you're looking at costs, conservatively speaking, at 690 per unit for a two-unit and 676.67 for a three-unit dwelling.

200
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:21,078
And that doesn't take into account, from the petitioner's perspective, the fact that he acquired the property so he's not

201
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:25,546
getting anything of value for his initial acquisition of the property.

202
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:40,650
In addition to that, and I know we had some discussion about it, in order to turn this to a residential project, there was a need to engage in environmental work and remove gas tanks which were underground.

203
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:48,332
And although that was done beforehand, and I know what the board's, or at least some members of the board's position is in that regard,

204
00:18:49,292 --> 00:19:01,659
You know, that is actually a cost that someone would have to expend in order to bring this to a residential unit, whether it was a single family, a three family or a two family.

205
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:17,169
So in terms of the cost and in terms of what is gonna come back and what he's gonna make on that, a two unit puts you in a situation where it's 690 per unit, roughly, if you can do it,

206
00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:21,511
with the site work at 237 and a construction allowance of 388.

207
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:26,234
And then, you know, what is that going to yield?

208
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:39,341
I went and I looked at the realtor.com, and this is a current listing for three Regis Road, but it's a single family.

209
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:47,145
But when you go to the map, it will show you, in essence, what the values are

210
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:51,890
going to realtor.com within that Elm Street area.

211
00:19:52,811 --> 00:20:14,687
Now, some of these haven't been tested certainly because they're not on the market, they're occupied and they're not for sale, but there isn't anything in here which would put you in a situation where you're gonna, on a single family, which most of these are, get anywhere close to

212
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:25,363
a million, a million two, something where, so the margins, my point is the margins are tight in this particular area.

213
00:20:26,204 --> 00:20:29,847
The property itself is not as desirable as some would be.

214
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:42,618
I did look at, just by way of example, and these are single families, they're not condos, but this particular one, 3 Regis Road,

215
00:20:43,957 --> 00:20:57,849
is 3,220 square feet which is more than you know that any of these condos in terms of square footage and the lot is is far greater in size and our price is at 998.

216
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:04,294
So in terms of where you know none of us know where the market's going to go but

217
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:18,325
In terms of, you know, the perception may be that these will go for a million two and, you know, two units will satisfy and that will be sufficient for the developer to make a profit.

218
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:21,547
The margin is much slimmer than that.

219
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:29,675
And if you look, there's one also, which is on Fulton street, again, in the same type of area, a single family house.

220
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:33,304
And that has been dropped in price to $880,000.

221
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:51,951
And, you know, again, it's a smaller lot, but the square footage of the house is the same or close to the same as to what you would propose with the condominium units themselves.

222
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,932
So if your margin is $700,000,

223
00:21:57,992 --> 00:22:01,254
If that's what that cost is going to be for a two-unit dwelling.

224
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:12,361
And again, the two-unit is tighter on construction costs because you can't spread out the site improvements over three units.

225
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:13,682
It's only over two units.

226
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:21,688
you're talking about roughly $180,000 per unit that could be realized.

227
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:38,376
And if market conditions and construction costs continue to rise, that all changes and your construction costs increase and then the 250 per square foot doesn't work.

228
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:42,138
With the three units, at least you have another unit

229
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:49,823
to bear some of those costs and come into a situation where you can make some money to recoup.

230
00:22:49,863 --> 00:22:55,766
But I think at this point, with a two-unit building, it would be difficult for the owner to break even.

231
00:22:57,227 --> 00:23:04,572
But a three-unit at least gives him something beyond what his original investment in this property was.

232
00:23:05,478 --> 00:23:10,121
So those are the numbers that were presented to us.

233
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:25,550
And the site costs are directly related to the fact that, you know, you've got to spend a sufficient, a significant amount of money on landscaping in this instance, because of the grade of the back rear property.

234
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,753
And also, you know, you're going to have to include a cost for retaining walls.

235
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:32,514
And I know that Zeke Brown,

236
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:39,457
and Jack Sullivan both think that the retaining wall costs that they have estimated is on the lighter side.

237
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:47,260
And that, you know, it doesn't, two units doesn't give you any room to breathe in terms of costs.

238
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,542
So that's why we're proposing the three unit development.

239
00:23:51,662 --> 00:24:01,245
And I hope that answers some of the questions that the board had with respect to hardship and the two unit versus the three unit.

240
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:05,090
Thank you, Attorney Desmond.

241
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,874
Questions from the board for Attorney Desmond on what you just shared?

242
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:28,228
So thank you, Attorney Desmond for the supplemental photo because it depicts accurately what it will be like without the trees and obviously with the trees will look much better.

243
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:35,971
But it's just that this new supplement gives a good comparison in terms of the proximity to the neighbor.

244
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:37,072
So I appreciate that.

245
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:38,412
Thank you.

246
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:42,714
Other questions or comments from the board?

247
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:48,876
Jim, go ahead.

248
00:24:50,977 --> 00:24:54,238
Are you comments for positive?

249
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:57,899
I mean, are we able to say what we think at this time?

250
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,200
So, Jim, my recommendation is we should talk about it in deliberation.

251
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:11,843
We technically are in deliberation, but I do intend to reopen for public comment on the new information first.

252
00:25:12,243 --> 00:25:13,103
Very good.

253
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:15,975
Okay, great.

254
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:20,881
Yeah, Attorney Desmond, I'll just say, appreciate the level of detail that went into this.

255
00:25:20,941 --> 00:25:26,027
I think it did resolve some of my uncertainties about the various options.

256
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:27,869
Thank you.

257
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,071
All right.

258
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:35,698
So we're gonna go ahead and reopen for public comment.

259
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:46,649
Please, if you remember the public, we did have a hearing on the matter in general, would like to focus to be on the presentation today.

260
00:25:46,669 --> 00:26:02,576
So yeah, if you remember the public, you'd like to speak on the matter, you can raise your hand on Zoom, you can turn on your camera and physically raise your hand, or you can email Dennis dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

261
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,801
I do not see any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter so far.

262
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:28,922
Dennis, have you received any letters from members of the public?

263
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:36,823
Yes, we actually received a letter from Zach Baer's City Council.

264
00:26:37,203 --> 00:26:41,824
And he actually asked to have it be read into the record during the meeting tonight.

265
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:43,184
So I can do that now if you would.

266
00:26:44,065 --> 00:26:44,245
Sure.

267
00:26:44,485 --> 00:26:44,665
Yeah.

268
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:45,585
Please go ahead.

269
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:45,765
Yeah.

270
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:46,225
OK.

271
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:50,293
So from City Council President Isaac B. Zach Behrs.

272
00:26:51,334 --> 00:27:00,655
Thank you for your consideration of my comments regarding the application for variance to dimension in use and or special permanent accordance with section 5.2.1 of Medford zoning ordinance.

273
00:27:01,015 --> 00:27:12,537
I am strongly supportive of the petitioner's application and as a member of the council through the 2020 through 2022 recodification process, I believe this application meets the authorial intent of section 94-5.2 and 94-5.2.1.2 of the city's zoning ordinance.

274
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:20,540
The primary reason I support this application is that it will benefit both the neighborhood and Medford as a whole.

275
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:30,064
The construction of new housing units in this currently underutilized lot that has operated in the past due to detrimental, non-conforming commercial use will significantly reduce the negative impacts on the surrounding community.

276
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:35,166
I agree with the petitioner's claims that the conversion to residential use will not be substantially more detrimental.

277
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:37,547
In fact, I believe it will be less detrimental than the existing use.

278
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:51,708
I'm also largely sympathetic to the petitioner's arguments that strict adherence to the zoning ordinance as written, building one single-family home would make the project financially infeasible based on the needs for reconstruction, retaining walls, and other challenging topographical conditions.

279
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:57,690
Given the City's priorities and the size of the parcels in question, constructing one single-family home would not be the best possible use for this property.

280
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:04,892
The petitioner has had extensive discussions with City employees and officials over several years about proposed changes to this property.

281
00:28:05,994 --> 00:28:19,182
I believe petitioner has worked in good faith to all the relevant necessary processes to reach a proposed application and site plan that aligns with the city's comprehensive plan, housing production plan, climate plan, and provides significant benefits over the property's existing condition and past uses.

282
00:28:19,562 --> 00:28:24,525
I encourage the Zoning Board of Appeals to grant relief to the petitioner and allow this project as described in the application to move forward.

283
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:29,247
All right, thank you, Dennis.

284
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:33,390
I see we have Planner Danielle Evans.

285
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:36,275
Please go ahead.

286
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:48,264
Danielle, please feel free to speak this time.

287
00:28:48,284 --> 00:28:55,350
Hi, I'm unmuted now.

288
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,992
Sorry, I am in car, but I wanted to call.

289
00:28:59,252 --> 00:29:01,513
I'm calling as actually in a butter.

290
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:08,636
So Daniel Evans, 79 Quavier Road, my house overlooks the property.

291
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:11,537
I want to speak in favor of this.

292
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:14,358
It's a blighted property.

293
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:16,819
It's a complete eyesore.

294
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,800
And I think housing there would be great.

295
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,422
Originally when they, so putting my planner hat on,

296
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:29,357
Originally, they were looking at a much denser proposal.

297
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,659
I think at one point, maybe six units, and then it went down to four.

298
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:54,371
And working with them, we strongly advised that three would be a good number and would be the most that we thought that this site could handle, recognizing that it does need parking because there's no parking on Elm Street and it's a state road.

299
00:29:56,637 --> 00:30:03,580
and that this would blend in with the neighborhood built character.

300
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:12,103
It's not overbearing of the adjacent properties.

301
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:19,865
I think the lot is unique in that it is a larger parcel among smaller parcels.

302
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:21,506
It does have the

303
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:35,966
the difficulties with the easement and also due to the traffic also on the road, it would be actually a benefit to set it back a bit.

304
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:44,272
So I just wanted to share that as a butter who did receive notice.

305
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,435
So we're talking with that hat on.

306
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:49,676
Thank you.

307
00:30:50,956 --> 00:30:51,257
All right.

308
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:51,777
Thank you.

309
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,113
Are there other members of the public who would like to speak on this matter?

310
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:05,177
Dennis, you're on mute.

311
00:31:05,517 --> 00:31:05,737
Yep.

312
00:31:06,017 --> 00:31:06,217
Yep.

313
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:13,221
Mike, I received an email from Anna Butter, who is on their phone and just wanted me to send it via this.

314
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:18,363
So I will say, and this is... Shoot.

315
00:31:19,924 --> 00:31:20,905
I just need her address.

316
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:28,100
The solving I think I know your address is I just want to confirm just make sure you get the right number for the record.

317
00:31:30,381 --> 00:31:31,081
In one second.

318
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:50,593
Okay, okay, so this is a question from Carolyn Sullivan 89 Elm Street.

319
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:57,711
basically say where will the front of the building be compared to the back of their house.

320
00:31:57,752 --> 00:32:00,975
So they're the house that in the image that we sort of showed earlier.

321
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:07,782
And I think if Attorney Desmond, if you can call it that one that was like the overlay looking down on the top.

322
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:14,809
Okay.

323
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:29,121
So here's the proposed building, which sits behind the drainage.

324
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:31,882
And I believe this is 89 here.

325
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:45,649
So the building is behind the existing building, so it's not going to have any impact on the light that would be received from this particular home.

326
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:46,950
I think there were some questions.

327
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,651
Ms.

328
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:50,532
Sullivan may have been on the last call, too.

329
00:32:52,037 --> 00:33:00,665
And on her property, there are a number of trees in the back that impact the ability.

330
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:07,791
I think she had a question about whether this would impact her light and her ability to have light in her backyard.

331
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:13,136
And when we were looking at it, she sits to the east of our property.

332
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:16,166
she's going to get sun most of the day.

333
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:19,087
And it's not going to be till late afternoon that it hits here.

334
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:26,611
But there were trees in the back of her property, if I can get to the correct slide, if that's your question.

335
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:29,352
Hold on.

336
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:30,613
Let me just get through the plans.

337
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:36,916
So here's a picture of the back.

338
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:43,607
The garage is actually beyond the easement.

339
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:56,035
So that's a fair representation of probably the distance between her house, how far this is set back, and her house.

340
00:33:56,295 --> 00:34:05,261
So this construction is not going to impact any light or any shadows on her home itself.

341
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:08,043
But there are these larger trees in the back.

342
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:16,335
that do seem as if they would impact the light to the backyard more so than the structure would.

343
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:18,957
Because again, she sits to the east of us.

344
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:22,720
And I think that was her question previously.

345
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:35,010
But I think this is a fair representation of the distance, the setback of the proposed structure.

346
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:38,053
It's not gonna be adjacent to her,

347
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:39,116
for dwelling.

348
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:45,603
So I hope that answers your question.

349
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:49,948
We did get a follow-up about how close to the property will they be digging.

350
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:02,640
And then there were a couple other questions just regarding construction.

351
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:08,284
And if any damage was done during construction, that would be up to the applicant.

352
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:12,267
That's not part of the zoning board's purview, those types of questions.

353
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:19,451
So in terms of like construction, any work like that is done through the building department, and then they're the ones who issue the permits.

354
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:23,954
But if any things like that, that doesn't really apply to a zoning board meeting.

355
00:35:23,974 --> 00:35:26,836
All right, great.

356
00:35:27,136 --> 00:35:27,717
Thank you, Dennis.

357
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:32,922
Other questions or comments from members of the public?

358
00:35:33,283 --> 00:35:37,466
Yeah, Jack Sullivan, address for the record, please.

359
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:51,758
Yep, I'm actually the project engineer, but I just wanted to follow up to what Kathleen Desmond said from the back corner of house number 89 to the front left corner of our proposed building is 26 feet.

360
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:56,226
In the front of our building is set back.

361
00:35:56,666 --> 00:36:06,370
If you go off out the backyard of number 89, you go back 12 feet and then go over the 24 feet.

362
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,751
That would be the front of our new building.

363
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:12,652
So there is a good distance between them, but I want to give the board those dimensions.

364
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:14,313
All right.

365
00:36:14,593 --> 00:36:14,893
Thank you.

366
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:16,333
Thank you.

367
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:22,676
Other questions or comments from members of the public?

368
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:36,663
Being none, the chair awaits a motion to re-enter deliberation, or to close the public portion of the hearing and re-enter deliberation.

369
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:42,185
Motion.

370
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:44,466
Go ahead, Mary.

371
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:45,547
Motion.

372
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:46,247
Thanks.

373
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:47,448
And seconded.

374
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,008
All right.

375
00:36:49,428 --> 00:36:51,309
We're going to take a roll call.

376
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:52,950
Jim?

377
00:36:57,524 --> 00:36:58,605
I. I. That.

378
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:28,247
Yes.

379
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,769
Uh, Mike, I, all right, we are now deliberating.

380
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:34,349
What do you think folks?

381
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:38,371
Uh, Jim, go ahead.

382
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:39,691
Thank you.

383
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,573
Uh, really compliments the area very well.

384
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,594
I'm not too far from that area.

385
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:56,738
And you know, when you look at what's there right now and you look what's proposed, I mean, it just, it, it really adds to that area.

386
00:37:57,673 --> 00:38:03,937
And I think having the three units makes better financial sense as well.

387
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:06,419
So I'm in full agreement of that.

388
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:16,026
And I actually think it's going to really, if it goes through, will really make the area look very nice.

389
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:18,988
So I just wanted to give you that comment.

390
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:20,008
All right.

391
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:20,809
Thank you, Jim.

392
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:22,930
Other thoughts from members of the board?

393
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:25,312
Andre?

394
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:27,439
Right.

395
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:28,019
Thank you.

396
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:28,339
Yeah.

397
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:34,881
As I mentioned when we were having the deliberations last time, I do think that I strongly support this.

398
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:40,283
I think that, you know, the use is a positive use change.

399
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:45,324
I think that the variances being requested are reasonable.

400
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:54,747
You know, having the drainage easement go diagonally right through the front is just something that's very unusual about this parcel.

401
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:56,027
And I think that the

402
00:38:56,747 --> 00:39:01,290
The property owner and the architects have dealt with that sensitively.

403
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:06,193
I think three units is appropriate for this site.

404
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:20,142
It's nice to see that given the fact that it is a busy road, you can pull in off of the road, so it's not going to have any detrimental, I think, safety impacts either on the roadways.

405
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:21,903
All right.

406
00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:22,403
Thank you.

407
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:24,885
Other thoughts from members of the board?

408
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:37,511
I'm just going to chime in and add that I recollect when this first came in front of the board and how things have changed and the added supplemental information was super helpful.

409
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:47,598
And I really appreciate the work that the developer has, the owner has put forward to make sure that we have all of that information.

410
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:55,407
That I agree with is a lot of the things are out of the control in particular that during pipe and showing that to us and things of that nature.

411
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:57,650
So, I appreciate it.

412
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,892
All right, thank you.

413
00:40:01,554 --> 00:40:03,637
Other thoughts from members of the board.

414
00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:14,698
Okay, I can go next.

415
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:24,961
So like I said, I think the information we received was very helpful just in terms of understanding the rationale behind proposing three units.

416
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:32,864
You know, from my perspective, that's an important part of establishing hardship in this case.

417
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:35,745
And so now I think we have

418
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:44,309
much better info about what was driving the decision to propose three versus some of the other alternatives.

419
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,991
So I appreciate that.

420
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:55,939
Like I said in the prior hearing, clearly the lot is unusual on a number of dimensions.

421
00:40:55,959 --> 00:41:02,424
So the topography, the soil conditions, the easement, all that fun stuff, the existing structure.

422
00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:05,086
And then to the

423
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,409
a butters concern.

424
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:25,057
When I think about the board's decision about whether to grant variance relief here, you've got to associate any detriment that that neighbor is claiming with the actual variances being requested.

425
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:33,361
And so in this case, this building isn't requesting relief for side yard setback on that side or height.

426
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:35,122
And so I don't

427
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:43,602
I'm not sure there's a good angle to claim that that detriments the reason not to move forward with this.

428
00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:49,726
So yeah, other thoughts from the board?

429
00:41:49,746 --> 00:41:57,011
OK, not seeing any.

430
00:41:57,151 --> 00:42:02,695
I do want to double check one detail with Attorney Desmond before anyone makes a motion.

431
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:05,277
So Attorney Desmond, as I understand it,

432
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:14,103
The applicants position is that the use in this case has not lapsed and that it would be a change of use being requested.

433
00:42:15,183 --> 00:42:22,745
My recollection is the city went on the record and stated that from their perspective, the use has lapsed.

434
00:42:22,825 --> 00:42:25,126
So it would just be a straight use variance.

435
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:31,428
Do you have a strong preference as to how we proceed in this case?

436
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,388
I'm inclined to just

437
00:42:33,507 --> 00:42:54,959
vote based on the city's determination, unless you think there's a... I mean, I would preserve the right that I think that's a valid argument, that it hasn't been abandoned and that the non-conforming use provisions could apply, but certainly that decision is within the prerogative of the board.

438
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:56,760
Okay, all right, thanks.

439
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,183
So yeah, I'm going to recommend to the board that because the city has gone on the record and

440
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:20,854
determine that the use lapsed, that any motion be on a use variance, as well as the dimensional variances for, let me just double check, frontage, lot width, usable open space, and parking.

441
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:25,695
But a member of the board could motion for either.

442
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:32,057
So yeah, looking for a motion in this matter.

443
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:38,553
Andre well, Mr chair, do we have to do 2 separate.

444
00:43:40,194 --> 00:43:43,636
Variances for the 1 for the use variance and 1 for the other variances.

445
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:48,158
So we could either do them all together or we could do them separate.

446
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,600
Okay, uh.

447
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:57,704
Which case I would like to, uh, it's a motion to approve for 85 Elm Street.

448
00:43:58,204 --> 00:44:02,907
The variance is requested for frontage lot with and usable open space as well as for, uh.

449
00:44:05,067 --> 00:44:07,469
parking and use variance.

450
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:08,729
All right.

451
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:09,770
Do I have a second?

452
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:10,611
I'll second.

453
00:44:11,411 --> 00:44:11,831
Okay.

454
00:44:13,032 --> 00:44:14,213
We're going to take a vote.

455
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:16,214
Yvette?

456
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:20,197
Aye.

457
00:44:21,177 --> 00:44:21,538
Mary?

458
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,438
Aye.

459
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:24,960
Andre?

460
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:25,800
Aye.

461
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:26,941
Jim?

462
00:44:27,742 --> 00:44:27,882
Aye.

463
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:29,443
Mike?

464
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:29,903
Aye.

465
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:31,644
All right.

466
00:44:32,364 --> 00:44:34,386
So the variances are approved.

467
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:47,711
And so, yeah, Attorney Desmond, if you, Dennis, correct me if I'm wrong here, but if you could draft a decision and send that to Dennis, that would be the next step.

468
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:48,191
Yeah.

469
00:44:48,411 --> 00:44:48,551
Okay.

470
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:49,092
Exactly.

471
00:44:49,672 --> 00:44:50,592
Okay.

472
00:44:50,612 --> 00:44:51,312
Thank you very much.

473
00:44:51,592 --> 00:44:51,793
Yeah.

474
00:44:51,813 --> 00:44:52,053
Thanks.

475
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:53,033
Thank you.

476
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:53,753
All right.

477
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:54,413
Good night, folks.

478
00:44:56,014 --> 00:44:56,274
All right.

479
00:44:56,574 --> 00:44:58,415
What do we have next, Dennis?

480
00:45:10,725 --> 00:45:12,986
I was on the beginning of the meeting myself.

481
00:45:13,006 --> 00:45:14,247
31 Lincoln Street, case number 8-2025-03.

482
00:45:14,307 --> 00:45:30,117
Applicant and owner of Rosha Properties LLC to add a second curb cut at 31 Lincoln Street, which was denied by the city engineer for the city of Medford zoning order chapter 94-6.1.4, off-street parking requirements, general 11.A.

483
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,638
All right, thank you.

484
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,081
Do we have a representative for the applicant in this matter?

485
00:45:37,181 --> 00:45:39,122
Attorney Bill O'Keefe, and I believe

486
00:45:40,557 --> 00:45:42,541
Yeah, the applicants also on to as well.

487
00:45:42,561 --> 00:45:44,604
Um, Nelson.

488
00:45:45,313 --> 00:45:46,434
Yeah, we're just looking for relief.

489
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:52,098
This was a project that was done for a renovation of a two-family house.

490
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,142
It's on the corner of Lincoln Street and Fairfield.

491
00:45:58,043 --> 00:46:02,767
And there's two parking spots that are on the Lincoln Street side.

492
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:13,195
And since the property has been done over, the Fairfield Street entrances, which are on the other side, accommodate the unit.

493
00:46:14,736 --> 00:46:25,742
And we're looking to have a driveway incorporated in order to make ease of access and provide them with a little bit level of comfort about not being able to park on the off street.

494
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:29,864
So in order to maximize the units value.

495
00:46:34,607 --> 00:46:39,289
All right, and you did supply some plans to the board.

496
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,851
Yeah, maybe we could.

497
00:46:44,538 --> 00:46:46,220
see where the proposed addition.

498
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,021
I can, I can bring it up if you want.

499
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:49,202
Yeah, that'd be great.

500
00:46:49,282 --> 00:46:51,184
It's basically, it's the plot plan, I think it's the big one.

501
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:51,964
Yes.

502
00:46:51,984 --> 00:47:00,191
I mean, consistent with the neighborhood, I had the opportunity to speak with the abutters there.

503
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:04,955
Now, this location is close to Arlington Street and the Mystic River.

504
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:11,560
So, it's a two-way street that has parking on both sides.

505
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:22,865
The 53 Fairfield Street, that's a carnal lot, and they have a driveway on the Fairfield side, as well as the Lincoln Street side.

506
00:47:24,846 --> 00:47:29,808
So their driveway would be directly across from the proposed driveway that we're making.

507
00:47:30,428 --> 00:47:36,571
And then 27 Lincoln and 30 Lincoln Street, spoke with both those owners, and they'd be,

508
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,734
More than happy to see the off-street parking.

509
00:47:40,994 --> 00:47:55,950
There's still ample opportunities for parking in that area, but seasonally we have the boaters and those that walk the bike path and use the Duggar Park area for fishing and other things.

510
00:47:56,771 --> 00:48:00,195
They maximize the parking over there as well as during the winter months.

511
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:09,379
Where you have the snow restrictions, so that impedes some of the opportunities to park.

512
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:14,042
So those are some of the challenges that come with the area.

513
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:16,263
It's a very narrow street.

514
00:48:16,983 --> 00:48:26,189
So as you're taking the left to go on to Fairfield or the right to go on to Fairfield, I mean, fire apparatus have struggled in the past.

515
00:48:27,229 --> 00:48:38,016
The previous owner and a part of the Bruce Nays, who a longtime friend and client, he always parked his vehicle in these parking spaces.

516
00:48:38,496 --> 00:48:44,020
But he was one of those old school gentlemen that refused to pay the city in order to cut the curve.

517
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:50,706
He just drove over it and parked his vehicle there in order to basically keep it off the street.

518
00:48:51,307 --> 00:48:55,791
And he did that for decades, for decades.

519
00:48:56,692 --> 00:49:02,118
He passed a few years ago and that's how the property became available, so on and so forth.

520
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:05,621
All right, thank you.

521
00:49:06,817 --> 00:49:12,279
Just an aside, I forgot at the outset to mention who would be voting in this matter.

522
00:49:12,919 --> 00:49:15,500
And so I will not be voting.

523
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,221
So we'll have the other five members present voting.

524
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:25,043
That would be Jim, Andre, Mary, Yvette, and Chris.

525
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,162
So just one clarifying question, Attorney Chief.

526
00:49:32,943 --> 00:49:40,947
So the prior owner, when they were parking in that location, was that driven by personal preference that they were choosing to park there?

527
00:49:41,007 --> 00:49:47,131
Or was there some other reason why they chose to park there versus parking on the street?

528
00:49:47,991 --> 00:49:48,912
It was both.

529
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:55,155
It was the size of the vehicle, his truck, and then personal preference.

530
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:56,676
OK.

531
00:49:56,736 --> 00:49:57,337
All right.

532
00:49:57,397 --> 00:49:57,677
Thank you.

533
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:03,698
Other questions from members of the board?

534
00:50:03,718 --> 00:50:13,180
I'm trying to get a street view on my computer, but all I see is just the house.

535
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,001
I can't see the street view.

536
00:50:15,021 --> 00:50:18,082
Can we pull that up on the screen?

537
00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:22,203
That's something you could do, Dennis.

538
00:50:22,983 --> 00:50:24,443
I mean, I have it on my screen.

539
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:28,325
I'll stop share right now and just let someone else do that.

540
00:50:28,385 --> 00:50:28,745
I'll look.

541
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,240
I can share it.

542
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,081
I have it up on mine.

543
00:50:36,402 --> 00:50:36,582
OK.

544
00:50:36,762 --> 00:50:36,962
Yeah.

545
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:37,722
Go ahead, Andre.

546
00:50:40,523 --> 00:50:42,283
So this is the Fairfield side right here.

547
00:50:42,463 --> 00:50:44,804
That's where the box truck is sitting in there.

548
00:50:45,284 --> 00:50:47,045
That would be where the parking would be.

549
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:48,925
The curb cut would be right here.

550
00:50:49,445 --> 00:50:49,765
Yes.

551
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:56,547
So it's a very narrow street, you can tell from looking at it.

552
00:50:56,607 --> 00:50:58,568
So if there's on-street parking, it's not

553
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,314
It's a two-way street, so if you got someone on each side, I mean, it's not really much room.

554
00:51:13,377 --> 00:51:20,301
So this was rehab where you have that awning there, that's a door there too, in order to enter Fairfield.

555
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:33,989
And then there's a door on the side of the house where the yellow truck is that was added in order to split the house so that it could be a two-family, because it was just being used as storage.

556
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:39,291
So it was very tastefully done, maintain the integrity of the area.

557
00:51:39,731 --> 00:52:01,080
And again, too, just that one curb cut there will still provide any additional unneeded parking for those that maybe have a hardship in terms of the snow emergency or the seasonal folks with access and use to the waterways for the Mystic River.

558
00:52:02,974 --> 00:52:03,334
Yeah.

559
00:52:03,474 --> 00:52:07,457
Each of the proponents, they were building the house there.

560
00:52:07,877 --> 00:52:09,479
That's where their driveway came out.

561
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:21,768
They were very nice in terms of, I mean, having that as an idea in terms of the woman that lives there getting in and out of her car and stuff like that because of the two-way street.

562
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:24,110
It'd be much safer for her if she was parked on the driveway.

563
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:30,475
And then the same thing with Mrs. Evans, whose house is behind it on the left of Lincoln Street.

564
00:52:33,036 --> 00:52:33,216
Yeah.

565
00:52:33,616 --> 00:52:38,120
I mean, you can see how even people pull up on the curb just to park since it's so narrow.

566
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:43,103
Yeah, it's one of those narrows and same thing with the fire apparatus and the snow.

567
00:52:43,123 --> 00:52:53,370
I mean, I know, I mean, years ago, the fire apparatus actually approached the fire department, actually approached them to keep his car on the in the driveway.

568
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:57,093
So, I mean, he was an old veteran.

569
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:06,051
Now that house that you're seeing there, that was recently rebuilt, that was burned down.

570
00:53:07,092 --> 00:53:15,320
But both those parcels were part of the legacy for the Phillips and the Bruce Nays families that go back generations.

571
00:53:22,854 --> 00:53:26,357
So the Lincoln Street side, they go in there, they park their two vehicles there.

572
00:53:27,218 --> 00:53:45,174
And as the project developed, they put central air for both units, and the central air AC units are behind on the left side, which impedes the depth of that driveway.

573
00:53:48,102 --> 00:53:53,605
So Mary, now that we have this street view up, do you have additional questions, or did you just want to see it?

574
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:55,726
Oh, that's very helpful.

575
00:53:55,746 --> 00:53:56,066
Thank you.

576
00:53:56,126 --> 00:54:02,029
So the affected area is right where the yellow truck is, right?

577
00:54:02,469 --> 00:54:02,789
Yes.

578
00:54:03,889 --> 00:54:04,210
That's right.

579
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:04,570
OK.

580
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:10,893
So there will be an additional opening surrounding the house.

581
00:54:14,374 --> 00:54:15,675
Into that driveway space, yes.

582
00:54:18,127 --> 00:54:18,607
Okay, thank you.

583
00:54:20,288 --> 00:54:29,870
So, Attorney O'Keefe, I just want to make sure that I understand the set of steps that this went through.

584
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:46,375
So I see the board has a letter from the city engineer with the initial denial, which states that the DPW commissioner is currently not permitting additional curb cuts due to the lack of on-street parking needs within the community.

585
00:54:47,516 --> 00:54:52,401
And then stating that appeals should be made directly to the DPW commissioner.

586
00:54:55,003 --> 00:55:08,295
And so the city engineer gave some examples as to the reasons why an additional curb cut might be considered on a case-by-case basis, special access, accessibility needs, for example.

587
00:55:10,117 --> 00:55:11,198
What happened from there?

588
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:14,255
In terms of what?

589
00:55:14,996 --> 00:55:27,663
Well, so the city engineer denied it, stating a general policy stated appeal directly to the DPW commissioner.

590
00:55:29,004 --> 00:55:30,685
And then we're hearing it today.

591
00:55:30,825 --> 00:55:33,767
So have you- To the Board of Appeals.

592
00:55:34,587 --> 00:55:34,927
Right, right.

593
00:55:34,947 --> 00:55:40,390
But have you discussed this with the DPW commissioner first or- I didn't have the opportunity, no.

594
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,231
I was just told to go to the Board of Appeals.

595
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:42,932
I see.

596
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:43,812
Yeah.

597
00:55:45,654 --> 00:55:47,155
And most of the engineering department.

598
00:55:49,297 --> 00:55:49,598
Got it.

599
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:50,078
Okay.

600
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:55,764
Um, and Mike, just to sort of jump in.

601
00:55:55,804 --> 00:56:03,531
So I speaking to the city engineer, he basically said the same thing to me that, you know, he basically said, go before the board of appeals on this matter.

602
00:56:04,932 --> 00:56:08,836
Even though the email says go before the commissioner.

603
00:56:10,843 --> 00:56:19,249
I think maybe because he knew that the DPW commissioner had decided that no secondary curb cuts would be allowed.

604
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:21,791
So that's why I think he just sort of said, go straight to us.

605
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:22,332
OK.

606
00:56:22,732 --> 00:56:22,792
OK.

607
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:23,152
Got it.

608
00:56:23,453 --> 00:56:23,693
Thanks.

609
00:56:24,153 --> 00:56:27,816
We just might not have that in writing, but that was the impression I got from him.

610
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:32,019
All right.

611
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,982
Other questions from the board?

612
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:44,996
So I just want to understand this.

613
00:56:45,037 --> 00:56:51,985
So this is supposed to go through the DPW first, or I didn't quite get that.

614
00:56:52,005 --> 00:56:56,431
Why procedurally the curb cut goes to the city engineer if the curb cut.

615
00:56:57,173 --> 00:57:02,417
is denied by the city engineer, someone can go straight to the zoning board.

616
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:05,619
So from a procedural standpoint, there's no procedural defect here.

617
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:20,490
I think just city engineer was stating that because this was a policy by the DPW commissioner that if the applicant chose to go to the DPW,

618
00:57:22,622 --> 00:57:28,729
Commissioner that some additional curb cuts might be granted on a case-by-case basis with special circumstances.

619
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:37,898
So this board is on equal footing with respect to the other option with DPW?

620
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,142
This board is essentially the

621
00:57:43,347 --> 00:57:45,267
legal decision maker in this case.

622
00:57:45,347 --> 00:57:55,309
So we can grant relief outside of the ordinance if a certain set of standards are met.

623
00:57:56,689 --> 00:58:03,011
Okay, so going before the DPW is not a necessity in this instance for this case?

624
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:04,371
Correct, yeah.

625
00:58:04,771 --> 00:58:05,371
Okay, thank you.

626
00:58:08,772 --> 00:58:11,072
Other questions from members of the board?

627
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:17,273
I do not see any.

628
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:23,095
I will now go ahead and open it up to public comments.

629
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:27,977
So if you're a member of the public and you would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

630
00:58:28,697 --> 00:58:39,741
Please either raise your hand on Zoom, physically raise your hand, get your camera turned on, or email dennisdmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

631
00:58:57,952 --> 00:59:02,815
All right, I'm not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

632
00:59:04,456 --> 00:59:09,720
Chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

633
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,521
So moved.

634
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,783
Do we have a second?

635
00:59:14,423 --> 00:59:14,823
Second.

636
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,785
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

637
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:18,946
Beth?

638
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:20,207
Aye.

639
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:21,768
Chris?

640
00:59:23,129 --> 00:59:23,249
Aye.

641
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:24,310
Mary?

642
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:25,391
Aye.

643
00:59:26,131 --> 00:59:26,611
Andre?

644
00:59:26,631 --> 00:59:26,691
Aye.

645
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:28,620
Jim.

646
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:29,400
Aye.

647
00:59:30,301 --> 00:59:30,601
All right.

648
00:59:31,061 --> 00:59:32,581
The board is now deliberating.

649
00:59:32,621 --> 00:59:38,203
And just as a reminder, the five members who just voted are the voting members on this matter.

650
00:59:38,223 --> 00:59:39,364
What do you think, folks?

651
00:59:41,505 --> 00:59:44,145
Appreciate it.

652
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:48,527
So just to be clear, we haven't, Attorney O'Keefe, we haven't voted on the actual ruling.

653
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:48,807
No, no.

654
00:59:49,387 --> 00:59:50,568
Yeah, got it.

655
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:51,308
Yeah, go ahead, Andre.

656
00:59:53,394 --> 01:00:00,480
Uh, so, you know, taking a look at the surroundings and the street, I think it actually makes a lot of sense to put a curb cut here.

657
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:09,908
I think there's benefit to the community to getting a car or 2 off of the streets since it is a narrow and congested street.

658
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:11,048
So a little.

659
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:15,389
I guess, surprised by the decision by the city agency.

660
01:00:15,429 --> 01:00:26,915
I think that this is a case where there's more parking will be accommodated in a safer way by having the off street, uh, parking approved.

661
01:00:26,955 --> 01:00:28,356
So I would support this.

662
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:33,038
Uh, go ahead, Jim.

663
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:35,960
I echo Andre's thoughts.

664
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,061
100% on that.

665
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:38,782
Those are my thoughts.

666
01:00:38,842 --> 01:00:39,362
Exactly.

667
01:00:42,537 --> 01:00:45,018
Right, other thoughts from the board?

668
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,901
Yeah, Jerry, I also agree.

669
01:00:52,741 --> 01:01:04,166
I think it makes sense and probably, you know, especially if it's divided into two units that each has some availability of off-street parking.

670
01:01:04,186 --> 01:01:08,228
All right, thank you.

671
01:01:09,608 --> 01:01:11,889
One thing I will say that I didn't say up front.

672
01:01:11,949 --> 01:01:15,951
So the relief being sought here in this case is a special permit.

673
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:21,213
So the standard for that is no substantial detriment to the public good.

674
01:01:22,834 --> 01:01:35,559
So the board would need to find no substantial detriment to the public good in allowing this additional curb cut to grant that relief.

675
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:43,613
Other thoughts from the board?

676
01:01:50,077 --> 01:01:52,379
If not, the chair awaits a motion.

677
01:01:56,242 --> 01:01:56,522
Andre?

678
01:01:57,482 --> 01:02:03,827
Motion to approve the special permit for a curb cut at this address.

679
01:02:05,479 --> 01:02:06,179
Second.

680
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:06,839
Second.

681
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:13,261
Just comment that I, you know, to your point, thanks for the clarification, Mike, about the, you know, the, the standard for this.

682
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:20,023
And I, I would say that not only is there not a detriment to this, but there is a benefit to the neighborhood.

683
01:02:20,823 --> 01:02:20,983
Right.

684
01:02:21,383 --> 01:02:21,723
Thank you.

685
01:02:21,743 --> 01:02:26,564
So a motion by Andre, seconded by Jim, we're going to take a roll call.

686
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:28,565
Mary.

687
01:02:28,585 --> 01:02:29,585
Aye.

688
01:02:30,545 --> 01:02:30,965
Chris.

689
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:32,125
Aye.

690
01:02:32,706 --> 01:02:32,966
Beth.

691
01:02:34,026 --> 01:02:34,146
Aye.

692
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:36,111
Jim?

693
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:36,952
Aye.

694
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:38,232
Andre?

695
01:02:38,252 --> 01:02:38,312
Aye.

696
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:41,854
All right, the special permit is approved.

697
01:02:43,574 --> 01:02:47,176
Appreciate everybody's time.

698
01:02:47,516 --> 01:02:48,336
Thank you.

699
01:02:48,577 --> 01:03:00,802
And just Attorney O'Keefe, if you could just put together just a very rough draft decision for, it'd just help expedite matters quite a bit, just to kind of get it, you know, the ball rolling and you can get this, you know,

700
01:03:01,937 --> 01:03:02,938
Cause otherwise I'll be writing it.

701
01:03:03,018 --> 01:03:05,539
So it's just to sort of get, at least get the matter started.

702
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:08,621
Just doesn't have to be much to sort of just release the initial decision.

703
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:09,321
So we can work from that.

704
01:03:09,341 --> 01:03:10,402
Absolutely.

705
01:03:10,482 --> 01:03:11,322
Not a problem, Dennis.

706
01:03:12,143 --> 01:03:13,323
Thank you for your time too as well.

707
01:03:13,363 --> 01:03:14,724
Appreciate it.

708
01:03:15,104 --> 01:03:15,444
Thank you.

709
01:03:15,484 --> 01:03:15,845
Good night.

710
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:19,867
What's up next, Dennis.

711
01:03:23,336 --> 01:03:36,344
121 Riverside Avenue case number 8 dash 2025 dash show for applicant and on the record housing authority, you know, an 8 foot high fence around the transformer and emergency generator enclosure at 121 Riverside Avenue, which is not allowed for the city.

712
01:03:36,904 --> 01:03:41,687
Chapter 94, 6.3.4 screening and buffers between residential and non residential uses.

713
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:44,538
All right, thank you, Dennis.

714
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:48,380
I'm going to appoint the same members this time, so I will not be voting.

715
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,381
The other five will.

716
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:53,243
Do we have a representative for the applicant?

717
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:58,065
Hello, this is Ben Wilson.

718
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:06,309
I'm the architect with BH plus A Architects in Boston, and I'm representing TLO.

719
01:04:07,229 --> 01:04:08,330
Good evening, everybody.

720
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:16,987
Evening, and we have gave just from the Medford housing authority with us as well.

721
01:04:17,007 --> 01:04:21,052
I believe he was on here a few minutes ago.

722
01:04:22,554 --> 01:04:27,880
Yes, and I think Brunette to our project manager is on also.

723
01:04:32,178 --> 01:04:45,559
So I'm going to start off by saying that I'm having some technical difficulties, and I wasn't able to access the documents that were submitted through my VPN.

724
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:52,540
I'm kind of in a travel mode right now, and I've not been able to get those onto the screen.

725
01:04:53,341 --> 01:05:03,128
So I would ask Dennis McDougall if he could provide the graphic support for the conversation.

726
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:04,870
Absolutely.

727
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:11,255
So I've got a couple of, I'm just going to call up a few onto my screen, and then we can sort of go from there.

728
01:05:22,302 --> 01:05:24,583
I'll go ahead and just start talking here.

729
01:05:24,823 --> 01:05:40,670
Our request has to do with the enclosure for the utilities, the generator, emergency generator, and transformer.

730
01:05:41,513 --> 01:05:46,594
at the front corner of the site at 121 Riverside Ave.

731
01:05:46,954 --> 01:05:59,937
And that's a salt and stall building, apartments, senior housing complex, and elderly and disabled housing for the housing authority.

732
01:06:01,477 --> 01:06:02,677
And we had

733
01:06:08,385 --> 01:06:26,907
Through the design process, we had carried an eight-foot-high enclosure and realized quite late in the game here that that extended above the allowable six-foot fence height.

734
01:06:30,728 --> 01:06:37,071
Just to give some setting here, you can see the upper left corner of the site.

735
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:42,353
There's sort of a pinkish area that has two red boxes and a green box.

736
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:47,876
The green is the generator, which sits up on a platform and has fuel storage underneath.

737
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:53,298
And the two red boxes are the generator and switchgear.

738
01:06:54,418 --> 01:06:57,640
The Riverside Ave runs vertical on the page.

739
01:06:58,595 --> 01:06:59,996
up kind of diagonally there.

740
01:07:00,576 --> 01:07:05,940
And Interstate 93 runs across the top of the page.

741
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:10,984
So this is an overpass.

742
01:07:11,004 --> 01:07:13,505
93 is an overpass over Riverside Ave.

743
01:07:13,585 --> 01:07:24,893
So the embankment that goes from the site elevation where the parking is and the generator enclosure going up the hill to the interstate

744
01:07:28,746 --> 01:07:35,672
edge is, I think it's somewhere around a 24 or 25 foot high embankment on the backside there.

745
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:43,279
So this is sort of the corner of the site tucked up against that embankment, a lot of vegetation.

746
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:53,528
And what we're proposing for the sake of screening the emergency generator that is projected up pretty high,

747
01:07:54,292 --> 01:08:09,846
We are proposing an eight foot high fence with privacy slatting and just to enhance the enclosure and conceal as much as possible of the equipment.

748
01:08:10,727 --> 01:08:11,768
And these pages here,

749
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:21,173
just simply show the comparison between a six foot high fence on the top and an eight foot high fence on the bottom.

750
01:08:21,874 --> 01:08:24,155
It's just a slight improvement.

751
01:08:24,895 --> 01:08:36,420
And obviously, I guess I have to admit that our modeling of the interstate and the embankment really doesn't accurately represent the picture.

752
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:44,878
What we're showing here is really a comparison between a 6-foot fence and an 8-foot fence.

753
01:08:45,378 --> 01:08:57,207
This view is from the parking lot, looking back towards essentially the resident side of the enclosure and the residential parking area.

754
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:06,277
And it's a subtle difference between the two, the six foot on the top and the eight foot high fence on the bottom.

755
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:22,305
We just felt that it does provide a little better visual coverage of the equipment and improves the aesthetic quality of the setting there.

756
01:09:23,345 --> 01:09:27,508
And this is a view from the sidewalk, essentially the street view.

757
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:57,320
Again, you can see a little more of the, if you scroll there just a bit, the top view is the six foot fence, a little more of the, you see the tips of the transformer and the switch box, you see a pretty big chunk of the generator with the eight foot high fence, it really just kind of screens the electrical equipment and leaves the generator just the top of it.

758
01:10:00,056 --> 01:10:21,642
So I think the hardship is really an aesthetic improvement for the public, the surrounding community, and the residents of the property as well.

759
01:10:25,703 --> 01:10:28,366
Do you have anything else to add to that, Gabe?

760
01:10:28,786 --> 01:10:28,986
Yeah.

761
01:10:29,046 --> 01:10:49,744
Well, we also plan on Riverside Ave, putting some shrubbery too, just getting some green in front of that fence also that eventually over time will hopefully grow higher than eight feet and just be a little more aesthetically pleasing, soften up the fence.

762
01:10:49,864 --> 01:10:50,124
Right.

763
01:10:51,029 --> 01:10:57,751
Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that, because we are also adding trees to the front, to the riverside outside as well.

764
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:04,674
I think we have two or three new trees planting along between the sidewalk and the enclosure.

765
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:08,875
Right.

766
01:11:09,195 --> 01:11:09,635
Thank you.

767
01:11:10,095 --> 01:11:14,997
And so one thing I'll just say, so section 6.3.11

768
01:11:18,764 --> 01:11:22,526
The ordinance lets us grant this relief by special permit.

769
01:11:22,566 --> 01:11:37,492
So we can waive any requirements surrounding the screening and buffers by special permit if there's no substantial detriment to the public good.

770
01:11:37,872 --> 01:11:39,653
So I just wanted to clarify that for the board.

771
01:11:42,814 --> 01:11:45,015
Questions or comments from the board?

772
01:11:53,286 --> 01:11:54,347
I have a question, Mike.

773
01:11:54,827 --> 01:11:56,968
Yeah, go ahead, Jim.

774
01:11:57,208 --> 01:12:03,831
If I understand it correctly, are you planning on planting trees all along the side of the fence?

775
01:12:08,093 --> 01:12:09,974
Was that the plan?

776
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:16,337
I'm not sure I heard your question exactly.

777
01:12:17,838 --> 01:12:22,360
The question is, what is the planned landscape?

778
01:12:23,308 --> 01:12:29,999
Yeah, we you had mentioned planting trees along the side of the fence that you're putting up.

779
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:36,008
Are you planning on planting trees all along the side of that a foot fence.

780
01:12:37,762 --> 01:12:38,983
Yes, I'm Dennis.

781
01:12:39,023 --> 01:12:42,607
If you go back to that this the site plan that might help.

782
01:12:43,087 --> 01:12:48,933
We have we have two trees to, you know, full scale full not sure what species.

783
01:12:48,993 --> 01:12:59,904
They are two trees planned Sign to the to the space between the sidewalk and the which and the enclosure, which is about 12 or 15 feet and

784
01:13:03,794 --> 01:13:25,528
We will be adding shrubbery and low-level plantings along the length of the fence facing the street, as well as we've adjusted the fence position so that we can have climbing hydrangea or something of that nature along the sidewalk that turns back into the site.

785
01:13:26,089 --> 01:13:27,450
So there's a portion of this

786
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:36,983
So it's a portion of the fence that would be covered by the trees.

787
01:13:37,724 --> 01:13:41,486
But the trees won't cover the entire fence?

788
01:13:42,927 --> 01:13:43,347
Correct.

789
01:13:43,407 --> 01:13:51,032
It would be the portion most visible to the public on Riverside Ave and when you exit the site onto Riverside Ave.

790
01:13:51,152 --> 01:13:51,452
Okay.

791
01:13:52,413 --> 01:13:53,834
The only reason why I asked,

792
01:13:54,463 --> 01:14:11,431
was if you were going to put trees along the side of the fence, an eight-foot fence, and you did it with a six-foot fence, if you planned to have the trees go over the fence, what would be the purpose of putting an eight-foot fence versus a six-foot fence?

793
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:13,933
But I understand it better now.

794
01:14:13,953 --> 01:14:22,377
You're putting two trees on the corners, and then you're putting the low planting below that.

795
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:34,305
And one other question I have, is the purpose of the fence to cover the top of the building, the generator?

796
01:14:35,606 --> 01:14:37,707
Because that's all I sort of see.

797
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:48,932
When I look at the eight foot fence, I see part of that generator sticking up versus a little more with the six foot fence.

798
01:14:50,893 --> 01:14:53,234
So is the purpose of it to hide that?

799
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:54,659
Right.

800
01:14:57,503 --> 01:15:04,513
The intent isn't necessarily to hide entirely the generator.

801
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:12,136
because it would become a very tall fence to do that.

802
01:15:12,737 --> 01:15:24,106
So what we're trying to do is minimize the extent that the generator projects and also hide the tips of the transformer and associated gear.

803
01:15:25,106 --> 01:15:33,193
So we felt that the eight-foot fence screened the transformer completely, which was a win.

804
01:15:34,273 --> 01:15:38,697
And we felt that the increased coverage of the generator was helpful.

805
01:15:40,017 --> 01:15:42,398
Great, thank you, thank you for that understanding.

806
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:51,722
Yeah, the fence is also there as a security element as well to keep, and safety element to keep people out of that.

807
01:15:52,402 --> 01:15:53,483
Thank you for that clarity.

808
01:15:53,503 --> 01:15:55,204
Okay.

809
01:15:57,505 --> 01:15:59,486
All right, Andre, go ahead.

810
01:16:01,706 --> 01:16:07,149
Yeah, this is a question, I guess mostly for Gabe, and it's not even really about the fence, but

811
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:13,265
Why in the world did you put this right next to the sidewalk on Riverside Ave?

812
01:16:15,827 --> 01:16:22,775
Ben, do you want to speak to the size of the generator and why it needed to be placed where it was placed?

813
01:16:25,256 --> 01:16:30,360
Yeah, there were a number of factors.

814
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:38,706
One is keeping the generator further away from residents.

815
01:16:39,727 --> 01:16:53,918
And the embankment of 93 seemed like a pretty good way of mitigating the noise factor of the generator as well as any

816
01:16:54,698 --> 01:16:56,179
any fume and exhaust.

817
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:09,966
Previously, currently, it exists right adjacent to the building, which is problematic in a number of levels, and it needed to be relocated.

818
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:16,630
Now, the other part of this is that the site itself, a good portion of that site falls within a

819
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:35,802
It's within the 100-foot and the 200-foot zone from the river, as well as some very low and previously known flooding areas.

820
01:17:35,903 --> 01:17:48,252
So we tried to get the generator to as high a ground as we could and not have a situation that was putting the emergency generator at risk of flooding.

821
01:17:49,477 --> 01:17:52,359
In proximity to the electrical room too.

822
01:17:53,879 --> 01:17:59,362
Yeah, and it's proximity to the electrical room is on that side of the building, that corner.

823
01:18:00,963 --> 01:18:09,227
Just from my perspective as a resident who lives on Riverside Ave, down by the Andrews School, and who walks to Medford Square a lot,

824
01:18:10,545 --> 01:18:14,346
this is really a terrible addition to the streetscape.

825
01:18:15,046 --> 01:18:29,769
I don't understand why you couldn't have put it more further away from the sidewalk, down by the embankment, but you could even have raised it up higher, but just put it further down by the middle of the parking lot.

826
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:33,530
I can speak to that a little bit.

827
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:34,590
We went through,

828
01:18:37,051 --> 01:18:47,167
The Mass Highway owns or we have a lease, which was in limbo for a long time.

829
01:18:48,622 --> 01:19:07,436
A lot of the areas that we have for resident parking was owned by MassDEP, which was, they were letting us use it for parking, so it became an issue with building anything that was on mail land further down into the parking lot.

830
01:19:08,117 --> 01:19:14,822
There were a lot of factors regarding that, and I agree, it is a big structure, but we're hoping with

831
01:19:16,303 --> 01:19:24,575
With the fence and with greenery trees shrubbery will try to make it as an attractive area as possible.

832
01:19:24,795 --> 01:19:25,677
What about lighting?

833
01:19:26,017 --> 01:19:29,983
I mean, we have homeless people sleeping under the overpass.

834
01:19:30,023 --> 01:19:30,984
This is right next to it.

835
01:19:31,024 --> 01:19:32,246
You're creating an 8 foot.

836
01:19:32,867 --> 01:19:43,752
You know, and shrubbery, you're just kind of creating more darkness all around that area, which is already feels like insecure for people to walk down in the evening.

837
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:47,034
So I think you should be looking at maybe some lighting as well.

838
01:19:47,054 --> 01:19:50,536
That's something to take into consideration, definitely.

839
01:19:55,915 --> 01:20:05,817
Now, there are a couple of lights on kind of opposing corners of that enclosure.

840
01:20:05,837 --> 01:20:10,318
And it's a good point, I think.

841
01:20:12,578 --> 01:20:21,140
Could be potential for increasing the lighting down along that side on the Riverside Ave side.

842
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,620
I think that would really help.

843
01:20:25,505 --> 01:20:26,405
All right, thank you.

844
01:20:27,565 --> 01:20:30,586
Other questions or comments from the board, Chris?

845
01:20:32,586 --> 01:20:34,727
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair.

846
01:20:36,227 --> 01:20:39,367
I'm curious, just a technical question on this.

847
01:20:40,308 --> 01:20:53,810
We are approving a special permit for an eight-foot versus a six-foot fence because there was mentioned at the beginning of the testimony about

848
01:20:54,947 --> 01:20:57,569
screening and whether or not that was allowed?

849
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,210
Yeah, that's right.

850
01:20:59,391 --> 01:21:15,663
So the petition is seeking relief from section 6.3.4, screening and buffers between residential and non-residential uses, which is a somewhat long section.

851
01:21:15,743 --> 01:21:18,886
But as part of that, there's some verbiage about

852
01:21:22,728 --> 01:21:43,797
six feet height on, yeah, okay, a fence other than a chain link fence not to exceed six feet in height complemented by suitable plantings and located at the border of the lot for the non-residential use may be substituted for a landscape buffer strip with some approval.

853
01:21:43,897 --> 01:21:49,620
So essentially it limits it at six feet in height

854
01:21:51,462 --> 01:22:10,701
And so, yeah, the relief being sought here is for it to be eight feet in height instead, or rather, because they would like it to be eight feet in height instead, the relief being sought here is to waive that portion of this section of the ordinance.

855
01:22:10,941 --> 01:22:16,166
And the standard for that is no substantial detriment to the public good.

856
01:22:19,879 --> 01:22:36,643
And so, you know, special permits can be granted with conditions, but the conditions need to be grounded in kind of mitigating the detriment of the relief being sought.

857
01:22:43,785 --> 01:22:46,966
Other questions or comments from the board?

858
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:55,714
All right, seeing none, we're going to open up for public comment.

859
01:22:55,794 --> 01:22:59,958
If you're a member of the public and you would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

860
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:08,468
Please raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand, type something in the chat, or email Dennis, emcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

861
01:23:24,035 --> 01:23:29,219
All right, I'm not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

862
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:32,441
Dennis, did we get any letters on this matter?

863
01:23:35,663 --> 01:23:36,264
You're on mute.

864
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:47,952
I got something, but it was through an email, and I'm just, and I, it was through like an email to a text, very complicated, I'm trying to figure it out, but it doesn't have a name, so.

865
01:23:48,553 --> 01:23:48,833
I see.

866
01:23:53,336 --> 01:23:56,859
I'm just talking about any visibility issues with the trees.

867
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,680
That was basically the crux of it.

868
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:05,746
They said they're in favor of it, but they were just curious if the trees would be an issue for visibility for cars pulling in and out.

869
01:24:08,068 --> 01:24:08,769
Sure.

870
01:24:09,409 --> 01:24:10,590
Could someone speak to that?

871
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:20,378
So is the location of one of the additional trees being planted, will that be obscuring visibility for cars exiting the lot?

872
01:24:22,717 --> 01:24:25,000
I can speak to that.

873
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:33,410
There is an existing tree there now that has been removed that would be in the corner of where the enclosure is.

874
01:24:34,311 --> 01:24:36,754
And the new trees are further away from the corner.

875
01:24:37,924 --> 01:24:41,265
There shouldn't be any issues with visibility.

876
01:24:41,706 --> 01:24:44,987
And this is a one-way exit for the site.

877
01:24:47,428 --> 01:24:53,390
So it should end in a two-lane exit.

878
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:56,832
And so it's a pretty clear passageway.

879
01:24:58,693 --> 01:24:59,393
All right.

880
01:25:00,033 --> 01:25:00,654
Thank you.

881
01:25:00,914 --> 01:25:03,495
I just want to double one check one thing for me.

882
01:25:05,062 --> 01:25:11,223
You mentioned existing, or you mentioned there is lighting in the area.

883
01:25:11,563 --> 01:25:21,485
Are you saying there will be lighting installed as part of this, or is it existing lighting somewhere close to that portion of the lot?

884
01:25:23,406 --> 01:25:25,406
There is lighting being installed.

885
01:25:26,066 --> 01:25:30,827
If we go back to that site plan, I think the lights are indicated there.

886
01:25:32,488 --> 01:25:33,048
They occur.

887
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:43,105
Um, there's, there's 1 light that is located at the corner of the actually, I think I saw them in the, in the renderings there.

888
01:25:43,145 --> 01:25:49,473
We have that included in is a light at the corner where the vehicle would.

889
01:25:50,537 --> 01:25:53,998
you know, at the corner of Riverside Avenue, the driveway, that corner.

890
01:25:54,578 --> 01:26:03,460
And then there's another light at the far corner of the enclosure next to the parking lot.

891
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:09,941
So there's some lighting over the generator area for security purpose.

892
01:26:11,602 --> 01:26:11,782
OK.

893
01:26:12,122 --> 01:26:12,402
Thank you.

894
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:22,236
I think there could possibly be an opportunity to add a street light along the sidewalk area.

895
01:26:26,578 --> 01:26:29,820
So let's see, this is a view from the entrance of the building.

896
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,881
That's from the parking lot.

897
01:26:31,901 --> 01:26:34,562
So this sheet, this page here has the view.

898
01:26:34,582 --> 01:26:36,983
You can see the one right at the corner.

899
01:26:37,003 --> 01:26:40,305
So that lights the intersection area.

900
01:26:41,105 --> 01:26:48,189
I think there could be a possibility of adding another one down along the Riverside Ave.

901
01:26:52,343 --> 01:27:01,169
I'd have to double check on where they are with the electrical utilities at this point.

902
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:03,931
OK.

903
01:27:04,112 --> 01:27:04,452
Thank you.

904
01:27:07,854 --> 01:27:12,638
I do not see any other members of the public that would like to speak on this matter.

905
01:27:12,818 --> 01:27:18,282
So chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

906
01:27:21,144 --> 01:27:21,464
Motion.

907
01:27:22,876 --> 01:27:23,276
A second?

908
01:27:23,676 --> 01:27:23,997
Seconded.

909
01:27:24,037 --> 01:27:24,997
All right.

910
01:27:25,357 --> 01:27:25,757
Jim?

911
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:32,240
Aye.

912
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:33,541
Andre?

913
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:34,221
Aye.

914
01:27:35,302 --> 01:27:35,682
Neri?

915
01:27:35,702 --> 01:27:37,103
Aye.

916
01:27:37,123 --> 01:27:38,483
Lizette?

917
01:27:40,624 --> 01:27:40,784
Aye.

918
01:27:42,025 --> 01:27:43,146
Chris, I know you were just rejoining.

919
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:46,067
We're just motioning to enter deliberation.

920
01:27:46,087 --> 01:27:48,068
Aye.

921
01:27:48,268 --> 01:27:50,229
All right.

922
01:27:50,269 --> 01:27:51,510
We are now deliberating.

923
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:52,250
You think, folks?

924
01:27:59,022 --> 01:28:07,427
Well, as I mentioned, I'm really not happy with the structure itself and its placement in that area.

925
01:28:07,567 --> 01:28:13,270
I understand the reasoning that was explained why it is there.

926
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:26,857
I think that I would strongly encourage folks to take a look at that, thinking about what it's like at nighttime to walk out there and imagine it and really include some

927
01:28:27,697 --> 01:28:28,538
appropriate lighting.

928
01:28:29,099 --> 01:28:32,103
Now, all of that has nothing to do with the six or eight-foot fence.

929
01:28:33,424 --> 01:28:46,081
On that matter, if it's going to be there, I'd rather have an eight-foot fence because really it would be better to help muffle the sound a little bit and to screen it from pedestrians.

930
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:49,657
All right, thank you, Andre.

931
01:28:49,997 --> 01:28:52,098
Other thoughts from members of the board?

932
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:54,680
Chris.

933
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:55,581
Thanks.

934
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:58,022
I'm sorry about the computer glitch.

935
01:28:59,523 --> 01:29:06,588
Yeah, actually, that was a point that I may have missed in my absence just for a few minutes.

936
01:29:06,688 --> 01:29:14,973
The sound of this, will there be any sound that transmits except when

937
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:20,057
Or only if the generator is operational.

938
01:29:20,637 --> 01:29:28,183
So is it something that sound perhaps one of the board members can move me in to what I missed if there was that question.

939
01:29:29,384 --> 01:29:32,847
I don't think we asked specifically about that.

940
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:33,588
It will.

941
01:29:34,292 --> 01:29:35,993
make some sounds while it's operational.

942
01:29:36,013 --> 01:29:38,693
I don't know if anyone would like to clarify that.

943
01:29:39,894 --> 01:29:41,234
Yeah, I would.

944
01:29:41,474 --> 01:29:48,736
I will say that it is a it does have a sound attenuating enclosure.

945
01:29:49,276 --> 01:29:54,098
The generator itself has a sound attenuating enclosure and

946
01:29:58,146 --> 01:30:06,390
And it is adjacent to, it's close to the highway embankment, which will, I think, help mitigate much of the sound.

947
01:30:09,592 --> 01:30:10,633
OK.

948
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:24,160
And the other part, which I believe, Mr. Chair, you were explaining while my computer shut off, was that the special permit for the height of the fence

949
01:30:25,899 --> 01:30:40,389
is what we are granting and not related to the screening of the, it's not a variance, it's a special permit.

950
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:52,417
Correct, yeah, so it's a special permit to waive a particular portion of the zoning ordinance pertaining to

951
01:30:54,519 --> 01:30:58,281
screening and buffers between residential and non-residential uses.

952
01:30:59,081 --> 01:31:06,765
So we're not being asked to grant any relief for the location itself.

953
01:31:06,905 --> 01:31:19,971
It's just there is a plan and relief is needed to modify the size of the fence, a special permit to waive the six-foot requirement.

954
01:31:20,751 --> 01:31:23,373
And the standard is, you know, would

955
01:31:24,538 --> 01:31:34,142
would not granting this relief, so waiving this requirement, be a substantial detriment to the public good.

956
01:31:34,262 --> 01:31:42,865
If allowing an eight-foot fence is not a substantial detriment to the public good, then the standard would be to award the special permit.

957
01:31:42,925 --> 01:31:46,867
If it would be a detriment to the public good, then

958
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:57,974
It would either be to deny the special permit or propose some condition that with the condition would be no substantial detriment to the public good.

959
01:31:57,994 --> 01:32:05,158
So yeah, it's just, if you change the fence height, substantial detriment to the public good, yes or no.

960
01:32:07,039 --> 01:32:12,062
So that's the basic, that's the level that we're- That's what we're being asked to decide.

961
01:32:12,322 --> 01:32:16,104
Yeah, and so any rationale one way or the other, I would recommend.

962
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:20,813
Grounding in the impact of changing the height of the fence.

963
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:27,586
Okay, anyone else wants to go ahead?

964
01:32:27,606 --> 01:32:28,969
I'm going to mull it over for a second.

965
01:32:29,868 --> 01:32:32,930
So I'm in agreement that we have to deal with this.

966
01:32:33,671 --> 01:32:37,974
I agree it's an eyesore that we have to deal with it.

967
01:32:38,014 --> 01:32:41,176
And so an eight-foot fence is appropriate in this space.

968
01:32:42,897 --> 01:32:58,668
That being said, could we also, in addition to requesting that additional lighting be considered and things of that nature, the fence itself, to my right, it's like this chain link, slightly transparent fence is what I'm looking at.

969
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:12,020
And could we also have them, could we write in to consider putting something that's not as transparent and maybe a little bit more aesthetically pleasing?

970
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:20,982
Because it is such, you know, right in front of a main street for the community and right by a big community building.

971
01:33:21,022 --> 01:33:25,724
And why can't people in that community have something nice in that area, right?

972
01:33:25,764 --> 01:33:28,705
Why do we have to have the bare bones basic of this

973
01:33:29,705 --> 01:33:33,748
chain link fence blocking this ugly generator that had to be put there, right?

974
01:33:34,548 --> 01:33:40,072
And so that's the only, I guess, question or statement that I'd like to make.

975
01:33:42,413 --> 01:33:43,474
Yeah.

976
01:33:44,694 --> 01:33:57,682
So, I mean, certainly we could ask for changes to the materials if we felt it would mitigate detriment to the public good.

977
01:33:59,807 --> 01:34:02,089
very specific about that can be problematic.

978
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:16,160
So, I mean, maybe as a starting point, we could clarify with the applicant and what are the materials planned and, you know, is there an opportunity to make it more aesthetically pleasing?

979
01:34:17,261 --> 01:34:22,025
I believe it states that the fence will be coded chain link with privacy slots.

980
01:34:26,584 --> 01:34:29,186
Yeah, that is correct.

981
01:34:29,386 --> 01:34:46,758
We have gone through a whole range of color and pattern evaluation with the privacy slats, mixing colors, using single colors and looking at different colors that would work.

982
01:34:47,358 --> 01:34:52,602
We've come to sort of a dark gray with a black chain link.

983
01:34:53,755 --> 01:35:03,162
because it tends to be a better backdrop foil for the plantings that would be in front of it.

984
01:35:03,942 --> 01:35:13,109
And it just tends to screen the grayness of the equipment better than some of the other options we felt.

985
01:35:13,972 --> 01:35:27,858
And this was, you know, we looked at grains, we looked at a couple different, we looked at trying to sort of mimic some of the pattern that happens on the building facade with vertical elements.

986
01:35:28,798 --> 01:35:32,920
And we really, we came back to being simpler was better.

987
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:43,685
And, you know, treating it almost like a shadow as opposed to some glorified object.

988
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:46,991
Thank you for that additional information.

989
01:35:47,011 --> 01:35:47,991
Sure.

990
01:35:50,212 --> 01:35:52,173
Other thoughts from the board, Andre?

991
01:35:52,573 --> 01:35:59,397
Well, just maybe a clarifying question again, because the landscaping around it, I feel like there are two different things were said.

992
01:35:59,437 --> 01:36:04,099
There's going to be a couple of trees I heard, and then I also heard shrubbery.

993
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:12,643
So could you just clarify what the landscaping is going to be right in front of it between the sidewalk and the generator?

994
01:36:14,017 --> 01:36:35,247
Yeah, so between the sidewalk and the generator is and I apologize for not having the exact number of somewhere between 13 and 15 feet I think and the the intent is to keep the trees more as part of a almost like a median spacing so they'd be halfway between the sidewalk and the

995
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:53,107
uh and the generator fence and shrubbery would be used against the base of the fence low and and we've we are in the process of revising the landscape plan to accommodate this we would have

996
01:36:55,489 --> 01:37:09,927
Climbing hydrangea along the pedestrian sidewalk that goes back into the site right adjacent to the fence are climbing on the fence and as it turns parallel with the Riverside have the.

997
01:37:11,237 --> 01:37:25,507
hydrangea would become more of a base planting of the fence, not necessarily trying to conceal it, but it would be buffering the fence.

998
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:40,697
I think we should be able to give you a much clearer picture of the landscaping in the near future, but probably within the month.

999
01:37:43,931 --> 01:37:44,211
Thank you.

1000
01:37:44,231 --> 01:37:49,494
A few other thoughts from the board.

1001
01:37:50,494 --> 01:37:51,695
Chris.

1002
01:37:52,395 --> 01:38:11,224
If I may, just for clarification, providing or requiring, rather, conditions on this, we would have to specify with some

1003
01:38:15,376 --> 01:38:27,039
Let's be specific, I guess, if we were to condition this, which I don't believe we're prepared to do tonight.

1004
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:41,044
But the landscaping and the screening of the screen, if you will, is important, I think, to echo what everyone else has been saying.

1005
01:38:45,436 --> 01:38:50,359
look pretty lousy for a while until the plantings grow in.

1006
01:38:52,120 --> 01:39:02,326
But is there a possibility of even making a more pleasing facade to the screen?

1007
01:39:05,247 --> 01:39:06,668
I don't know.

1008
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:09,930
But again, we can't specify something without

1009
01:39:12,038 --> 01:39:15,199
telling, you know, the applicant exactly what we're talking about.

1010
01:39:15,859 --> 01:39:27,184
So the one thing we definitely can't do is condition on some approval by some other body down the road.

1011
01:39:28,564 --> 01:39:37,367
So it would have to be kind of like a fully formulated approval with conditions.

1012
01:39:37,427 --> 01:39:38,588
And yeah, the conditions

1013
01:39:39,889 --> 01:39:55,938
Um, don't have to completely specify what needs to happen, but they have to be specific enough that they, um, that they have bite like a condition that doesn't require anything isn't really a condition at all.

1014
01:39:56,579 --> 01:40:05,184
Um, so, so yeah, it would be either try to, it would be like approve or no.

1015
01:40:06,091 --> 01:40:22,323
approve with conditions where we specify something well formulated enough today that would kind of mitigate any detriment to the public good that was an area of concern.

1016
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:34,452
Or we could make a request to the applicant and ask them to, you know, if they're willing to continue and show us

1017
01:40:35,674 --> 01:40:44,420
an update to the plans, but that's getting into the territory that's not necessarily our purview.

1018
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:49,584
So we have to keep it grounded in the relief being sought here.

1019
01:40:50,105 --> 01:41:01,073
We're not approvers on the landscaping plan, but the landscaping, since it is related to the screening and buffers, we're being asked to increase the height, maybe

1020
01:41:03,346 --> 01:41:08,829
Maybe the impact to the public good is different, depending on some of the choices made.

1021
01:41:08,929 --> 01:41:17,994
So that would be a scenario where we could ask for some requests and see if the applicant was willing to continue.

1022
01:41:18,034 --> 01:41:20,196
But yeah, we're a little limited in what we can do.

1023
01:41:20,216 --> 01:41:22,357
Yeah.

1024
01:41:22,657 --> 01:41:30,061
And I understand you're spending all these years designing and building that.

1025
01:41:31,699 --> 01:41:35,282
the property so you don't want something to take away from it either.

1026
01:41:35,302 --> 01:41:42,507
So I understand from the architect's perspective and from the housing authority's perspective, that same feeling, I'm sure.

1027
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:56,818
But it does seem like, you know, perhaps a little more thought in the landscaping realm would have been beneficial in this case.

1028
01:41:58,479 --> 01:41:58,780
That's it.

1029
01:41:58,980 --> 01:41:59,200
Thank you.

1030
01:42:02,731 --> 01:42:05,158
Other thoughts from the board.

1031
01:42:15,182 --> 01:42:16,263
Andre, were you going to say something?

1032
01:42:16,423 --> 01:42:16,563
Yeah.

1033
01:42:16,623 --> 01:42:20,326
Well, I'm just, I mean, I don't think there's anything more that we can do.

1034
01:42:20,366 --> 01:42:23,908
You know, it's really like they can already, they can build a six foot fence around this thing.

1035
01:42:24,248 --> 01:42:28,191
Just a question of whether it's an eight foot fence, eight foot fence just makes more sense.

1036
01:42:28,271 --> 01:42:28,871
It screens it.

1037
01:42:28,951 --> 01:42:29,972
I mean, it's, it's there.

1038
01:42:30,492 --> 01:42:38,017
So I, I'm ready to, uh, I'd like to make a motion to approve the special permit for the eight foot fence.

1039
01:42:40,599 --> 01:42:40,859
Okay.

1040
01:42:40,879 --> 01:42:44,562
We're going to take a roll call, uh, Mary,

1041
01:42:45,813 --> 01:42:48,534
I this.

1042
01:42:49,435 --> 01:42:58,940
And I Andre I the special permit is approved.

1043
01:43:02,181 --> 01:43:09,445
Okay, thank you so thanks and I will be working on the decision and I'll get it to you soon.

1044
01:43:10,145 --> 01:43:13,747
Basically what happens I write it and set it up for legal counsel to review.

1045
01:43:14,434 --> 01:43:16,434
When they come back, give off signatures.

1046
01:43:16,774 --> 01:43:19,235
At that point, once it's signed, it's filed in the clerk's office.

1047
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:22,195
And at that point, there's a 20 days appeals period after that.

1048
01:43:22,295 --> 01:43:28,397
So we're still, you know, but you've got the approval to that.

1049
01:43:28,417 --> 01:43:33,157
But special permits are, given the decisions, are usually a little more straightforward.

1050
01:43:33,198 --> 01:43:38,959
We've had a few number of decisions involving fences recently that I can use to work off of.

1051
01:43:39,019 --> 01:43:40,919
So I should be able to get through it in the next few weeks.

1052
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:42,960
Okay, thank you so much.

1053
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,421
Thanks.

1054
01:43:44,481 --> 01:43:51,863
And sorry, I just want to say, like, despite what, you know, about this particular issue, the project itself, the renovation of the building is fantastic.

1055
01:43:51,883 --> 01:43:55,544
So, yeah, I want to say really hope everyone comes by.

1056
01:43:55,725 --> 01:43:57,405
It's, it's fully our intention.

1057
01:43:58,045 --> 01:43:59,926
The landscaping is going to be amazing.

1058
01:44:00,546 --> 01:44:06,607
We're under budget constraints, our offices are out of there, we're there every day, our residents are there every day.

1059
01:44:06,767 --> 01:44:12,729
It's fully our intention even to make that corner as right now, as unattractive as it may be.

1060
01:44:13,649 --> 01:44:23,691
Over time, maybe our original planting, we're going to try to make it as pretty as possible, but over time with funding, I want that corner, the whole site to be beautiful.

1061
01:44:23,751 --> 01:44:24,972
That's going to be our intention.

1062
01:44:25,532 --> 01:44:30,093
We don't want any of the site for people to walk by and say, I hate that.

1063
01:44:30,653 --> 01:44:39,355
So, our intention is for everyone to walk by this development and be stunned by it because it is going to be I want everyone to come when it's over.

1064
01:44:39,895 --> 01:44:44,916
Um, it's, it's really kind of a shine going to be a shining example of what affordable housing can be.

1065
01:44:45,637 --> 01:44:45,897
Thank you.

1066
01:44:45,957 --> 01:44:47,137
I hope you all come visit it.

1067
01:44:47,437 --> 01:44:47,797
Thank you.

1068
01:44:47,857 --> 01:44:48,197
Everyone.

1069
01:44:49,357 --> 01:44:49,597
Great.

1070
01:44:49,998 --> 01:44:50,338
Thank you.

1071
01:44:50,358 --> 01:44:50,758
Thank you.

1072
01:44:53,278 --> 01:44:53,478
Right.

1073
01:44:53,718 --> 01:44:54,539
Dennis, what's next?

1074
01:44:54,559 --> 01:44:58,199
46 Tinkert street.

1075
01:45:01,574 --> 01:45:09,236
20 25 dash 0, 5, after an owner, Michael deterring to add a 3rd floor, 46 acres deep street, which is an existing non-conforming structure in general residents.

1076
01:45:09,536 --> 01:45:12,217
So, which is not allowed for the city matrix on the board.

1077
01:45:12,237 --> 01:45:15,038
It's checking 94 table, be tabled dimensional requirements.

1078
01:45:15,638 --> 01:45:21,479
This will also extend the existing non-conforming side yard setback, requiring a social permit for the city matrix, owning ordinance chapter 94, 5.3.1. 1.

1079
01:45:24,528 --> 01:45:25,448
All right, thank you, Dennis.

1080
01:45:25,849 --> 01:45:28,130
We're just going to stick with what's working.

1081
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:30,691
The other five members will be voting.

1082
01:45:30,751 --> 01:45:31,511
I will not be voting.

1083
01:45:31,991 --> 01:45:35,533
All right, do we have a representative for the applicant?

1084
01:45:36,353 --> 01:45:42,495
Yes, my name is Michael Dedding, but the owner is actually Doug, and he's going to be speaking.

1085
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:43,796
I'm the contractor.

1086
01:45:43,816 --> 01:45:45,237
All right, wonderful.

1087
01:45:45,837 --> 01:45:46,437
Thanks, Doug.

1088
01:45:46,457 --> 01:45:46,877
Go ahead.

1089
01:45:46,917 --> 01:45:47,277
Sorry.

1090
01:45:48,478 --> 01:45:49,759
Can everybody hear me fine?

1091
01:45:50,179 --> 01:45:50,379
Yes.

1092
01:45:50,399 --> 01:45:53,120
Let me just start the screen.

1093
01:45:56,009 --> 01:45:56,669
Set the request.

1094
01:46:00,332 --> 01:46:04,795
You're all set.

1095
01:46:04,815 --> 01:46:06,616
Does it share the full screen or does it?

1096
01:46:06,636 --> 01:46:09,318
It's interesting.

1097
01:46:11,959 --> 01:46:12,480
There we go.

1098
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:13,380
It should be fine.

1099
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,161
You have co-host status now, so you should be OK.

1100
01:46:15,282 --> 01:46:20,145
Is that good?

1101
01:46:20,825 --> 01:46:21,045
Yes.

1102
01:46:21,726 --> 01:46:22,866
Now, is it too small?

1103
01:46:22,886 --> 01:46:25,068
Because I have a large screen, sometimes it shows up a little.

1104
01:46:26,668 --> 01:46:29,131
Um, I'm sure it's different for everybody.

1105
01:46:29,151 --> 01:46:30,752
It looks okay from my perspective.

1106
01:46:31,413 --> 01:46:31,633
Great.

1107
01:46:32,354 --> 01:46:39,620
Okay, so currently, what we're looking to do is build the third floor addition on 4648 Pickard Street.

1108
01:46:40,161 --> 01:46:46,487
It is a two family, I think what you call a nonconforming residence.

1109
01:46:49,351 --> 01:46:50,691
I'll give a brief summary.

1110
01:46:50,711 --> 01:46:54,993
We're seeing a special permit to build an additional floor onto the existing two-family house.

1111
01:46:55,153 --> 01:46:59,754
The additional will require egress with a newly erected rear porch and staircase.

1112
01:47:01,255 --> 01:47:08,777
My wife and I both live on the second floor, so this third floor will have stairs coming up from the second floor.

1113
01:47:10,718 --> 01:47:16,160
And we're looking to add a master bedroom, additional living and office space to accommodate a growing family.

1114
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:28,208
We purchased the house in October 2015 and we plan to have a child and her mother will assist with the childcare.

1115
01:47:28,768 --> 01:47:34,012
Likewise, it'll address some of the lack of space while we work from home.

1116
01:47:35,152 --> 01:47:38,194
We look forward to having the required space and continue living in Medford.

1117
01:47:40,336 --> 01:47:42,978
So just quickly, here's what it currently looks like.

1118
01:47:45,332 --> 01:47:49,755
And the repose shows the third story added right here.

1119
01:47:52,436 --> 01:48:01,001
There's no changes to the current building in terms of, you know, it's gonna use the existing floor space.

1120
01:48:02,021 --> 01:48:09,666
There will be on the rear egress stairs coming down from the third to the second.

1121
01:48:11,444 --> 01:48:14,746
To the 1st, and then down to the ground level in the back.

1122
01:48:16,027 --> 01:48:20,230
And that's that's you can see it here on the on the on the plot plan.

1123
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:24,272
I've taken from Medford engineering and survey.

1124
01:48:26,593 --> 01:48:27,274
We're going to build.

1125
01:48:29,795 --> 01:48:36,920
The 3rd story porch right here above the 2nd story and the landing and the staircase are going to come down here on the left.

1126
01:48:40,108 --> 01:48:44,590
So the third story is going to be built on top of the existing two-story.

1127
01:48:52,312 --> 01:48:54,193
Just some quick things.

1128
01:48:54,893 --> 01:48:56,433
We did meet with all the neighbors.

1129
01:48:56,714 --> 01:49:01,375
We actually went out right around dinner time when everybody was getting home from work.

1130
01:49:01,475 --> 01:49:02,876
It was a little cold out at night.

1131
01:49:03,056 --> 01:49:06,877
And over the span of four days, we obtained 28 signatures of support.

1132
01:49:08,714 --> 01:49:19,461
Everyone that we met with was supporting and, you know, it's good to, you know, go out and meet with some of the fellow owners I've never met in the neighborhood.

1133
01:49:20,622 --> 01:49:23,364
We intend to maintain the existing looking character of the neighborhood.

1134
01:49:26,106 --> 01:49:29,848
And, of course, as I mentioned earlier, the footprint of the building will not change.

1135
01:49:30,569 --> 01:49:34,852
And we're not asking to infringe further on the existing

1136
01:49:36,059 --> 01:49:40,000
what I believe are called non-conforming setbacks, if I'm using the correct word.

1137
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,021
It will also be within the height restrictions.

1138
01:49:47,062 --> 01:49:52,763
This right here shows a bit of the floor plan layout in the rear deck.

1139
01:49:56,624 --> 01:49:58,284
That's pretty much all I have.

1140
01:49:59,044 --> 01:50:01,585
Anybody has any questions or comments?

1141
01:50:04,771 --> 01:50:06,652
All right, I'll open it up to questions from the board.

1142
01:50:10,295 --> 01:50:10,775
Andre.

1143
01:50:13,877 --> 01:50:20,142
Yes, is the roof going to be a flat roof or is it going to be dormer?

1144
01:50:21,963 --> 01:50:26,606
So, in order to maintain the within the height restrictions, it will be.

1145
01:50:29,662 --> 01:50:44,612
I shouldn't say a flat roof, but I don't know the exact degree of the angle, but it's... Let me just bring up the diagram.

1146
01:50:44,672 --> 01:50:47,014
I think this kind of shows it.

1147
01:50:47,414 --> 01:50:47,735
Got it.

1148
01:50:47,815 --> 01:50:48,835
It gives you a better idea.

1149
01:50:48,855 --> 01:50:50,637
Not like a half story or anything.

1150
01:50:50,717 --> 01:50:52,318
It's just for runoff.

1151
01:50:53,239 --> 01:50:53,439
Right.

1152
01:50:53,985 --> 01:50:54,525
Yeah, okay.

1153
01:50:54,926 --> 01:50:55,246
Thank you.

1154
01:50:55,386 --> 01:50:57,027
Yeah, it does need a membrane roof.

1155
01:50:57,287 --> 01:51:02,429
So shingles you can't use because the, I guess the incline is an issue.

1156
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:03,190
Right.

1157
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,171
It'll be a hip roof style.

1158
01:51:10,013 --> 01:51:10,333
Okay.

1159
01:51:12,114 --> 01:51:22,920
So it will be, I mean, the same, it looks like it'll be about the same height as the adjacent buildings, like at their peak.

1160
01:51:26,874 --> 01:51:29,855
So this details it.

1161
01:51:30,055 --> 01:51:36,717
If you look, this is actually Jim's house, which Mike also built.

1162
01:51:37,137 --> 01:51:42,479
I don't know if that's at 35 feet, but I don't think it'll be... I think it'll be pretty close to that one.

1163
01:51:45,259 --> 01:51:54,182
I don't know that we've actually done what the height of the other buildings are, but this is... I don't know if you could comment, John or Mike.

1164
01:51:56,762 --> 01:52:01,344
It will be, I'm sorry, John Mavuso, I helped Mike with the paperwork on this job.

1165
01:52:02,045 --> 01:52:03,526
It will fit in with the neighborhood.

1166
01:52:03,786 --> 01:52:07,368
There are a couple of houses that are still only two-story.

1167
01:52:07,928 --> 01:52:10,329
Most of them are two and a half with pitched roofs.

1168
01:52:10,869 --> 01:52:14,151
The height will be pretty consistent with most of the neighbors.

1169
01:52:14,831 --> 01:52:18,153
Again, the height of the roof itself will not exceed the 35 feet.

1170
01:52:19,854 --> 01:52:22,176
We're asking for is only the third story.

1171
01:52:22,717 --> 01:52:26,480
It is a slight pitched hip roof to accommodate runoff.

1172
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:27,581
Absolutely.

1173
01:52:29,763 --> 01:52:30,063
Thank you.

1174
01:52:32,325 --> 01:52:33,926
Other questions from the board.

1175
01:52:36,228 --> 01:52:38,090
So currently, this is a two family.

1176
01:52:39,511 --> 01:52:40,052
That's correct.

1177
01:52:40,172 --> 01:52:41,433
We live on the second floor.

1178
01:52:42,714 --> 01:52:43,014
Thank you.

1179
01:52:48,121 --> 01:53:03,730
So one thing I would just like to understand is, so by right, you could still expand up as a two and a half, which would impose some limits on the floor area up there.

1180
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:10,975
Could you walk us through why two and a half doesn't really work?

1181
01:53:11,961 --> 01:53:13,403
In this case, right?

1182
01:53:13,443 --> 01:53:16,907
So I still spoke quickly with the building department about that.

1183
01:53:16,947 --> 01:53:20,051
We went through the different options on how we can do.

1184
01:53:21,653 --> 01:53:24,196
I think they were called cables.

1185
01:53:25,497 --> 01:53:26,098
So basically.

1186
01:53:29,339 --> 01:53:30,300
I got a quick rundown.

1187
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:33,303
I wasn't able to get a visual representation from my architect.

1188
01:53:34,184 --> 01:53:35,445
But I think the square footage.

1189
01:53:35,465 --> 01:53:36,706
Go ahead.

1190
01:53:37,246 --> 01:53:39,028
Could you pull up the floor plan again, Doug?

1191
01:53:39,108 --> 01:53:39,829
I mean, that might help.

1192
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:42,611
It's not a large building.

1193
01:53:45,554 --> 01:53:51,420
So the additional third story, again, will be a bedroom, bathroom, a small sitting area.

1194
01:53:53,712 --> 01:54:02,013
The third, a half story up there, we would still, a half story is not gonna give us very much room at all, is the problem here.

1195
01:54:03,084 --> 01:54:04,525
bedroom, bathroom, living area.

1196
01:54:05,005 --> 01:54:05,805
That's just about it.

1197
01:54:06,146 --> 01:54:10,368
I can't read the dimensions on my screen, but can you see what the length is on that?

1198
01:54:11,228 --> 01:54:18,191
I pulled up the property card and the upper story floor area is 1360 square foot.

1199
01:54:18,331 --> 01:54:23,133
So I think it would be half of that if it was a two and a half would be the cap.

1200
01:54:23,213 --> 01:54:30,837
So 680 square foot would be the max that would still be considered two and a half.

1201
01:54:33,309 --> 01:54:40,075
Yes, but so then we would have, you know, eight foot walls on one half of the building and then it would drop back down.

1202
01:54:40,135 --> 01:54:43,839
It would be kind of peculiar looking, honestly.

1203
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:50,625
You know, and again, several of the houses in the area do fit in with this.

1204
01:54:52,266 --> 01:54:58,752
I don't know if you're familiar with that house on Fulton Spring where they did a small addition on the front, but the back of the house is the same.

1205
01:54:58,812 --> 01:54:59,533
It just doesn't.

1206
01:55:00,866 --> 01:55:03,911
It's just not giving you the space that you really need for a family.

1207
01:55:03,931 --> 01:55:07,015
Thank you.

1208
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:13,145
Other questions from the board?

1209
01:55:16,717 --> 01:55:17,818
Can I say one thing?

1210
01:55:18,238 --> 01:55:19,058
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1211
01:55:19,078 --> 01:55:20,119
Yeah, please go ahead.

1212
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:35,387
So this exact thing that Doug is requesting, we actually did directly across the street for similar reasons that, you know, they plan on having a few kids and his mother-in-law would be moving in.

1213
01:55:35,527 --> 01:55:43,431
So at 41 Pinkert, you guys granted it back a few years because it was a very similar issue.

1214
01:55:44,727 --> 01:55:46,288
you know, they want to stay in Medford.

1215
01:55:46,348 --> 01:55:51,189
They don't want to try to uproot everything and move.

1216
01:55:51,229 --> 01:55:52,490
They like being in Medford.

1217
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:56,971
So that's one of the main reasons they're looking to lift this up too.

1218
01:55:57,311 --> 01:55:59,492
So I just wanted to add that.

1219
01:56:00,792 --> 01:56:00,993
Okay.

1220
01:56:01,273 --> 01:56:01,533
Thank you.

1221
01:56:02,851 --> 01:56:04,593
Other questions from the board?

1222
01:56:05,173 --> 01:56:06,054
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1223
01:56:06,114 --> 01:56:06,995
My name is Jim.

1224
01:56:07,075 --> 01:56:08,656
I'm actually the neighbor to Doug.

1225
01:56:08,836 --> 01:56:10,478
Oh, OK, Jim.

1226
01:56:10,898 --> 01:56:16,563
So I am going to open it up for public comment in the near future, but I apologize.

1227
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:17,664
No worries.

1228
01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:20,947
Other questions from the board?

1229
01:56:25,957 --> 01:56:28,038
Can I just I'm looking at the plans and I'm.

1230
01:56:28,058 --> 01:56:34,300
So, I'm understanding this to be going from a 2 units to 2 units again.

1231
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:41,422
And it's just an increase in the bedrooms on the 2nd floor and living space.

1232
01:56:41,482 --> 01:56:42,182
Is that what I'm seeing?

1233
01:56:43,602 --> 01:56:48,466
I think it's, so the way the units, they're like stacked on top of each other.

1234
01:56:48,646 --> 01:56:55,351
And so this would essentially be making the top unit, it would be giving it an additional floor.

1235
01:56:56,032 --> 01:56:59,855
And so we're currently looking at that additional floor.

1236
01:57:00,015 --> 01:57:04,558
So all of the stuff currently on the screen is new space.

1237
01:57:04,658 --> 01:57:09,001
And then the second floor would need a staircase added.

1238
01:57:10,022 --> 01:57:15,247
I'm not sure if there are any other proposed reconfigurations, but the relief being sought here is this new floor.

1239
01:57:17,089 --> 01:57:17,450
Okay.

1240
01:57:19,252 --> 01:57:19,532
Great.

1241
01:57:21,193 --> 01:57:21,574
Thank you.

1242
01:57:24,196 --> 01:57:25,538
Other questions from the board?

1243
01:57:29,915 --> 01:57:34,399
This is a special permit too?

1244
01:57:36,201 --> 01:57:38,843
I think this requires a variance.

1245
01:57:38,863 --> 01:57:39,764
Let me double check.

1246
01:57:41,566 --> 01:57:42,126
Both, sir.

1247
01:57:42,507 --> 01:57:43,888
Variance and a special permit.

1248
01:57:45,049 --> 01:57:50,875
Yeah, it's a variance for the height, but a special permit because they're extending the existing nonconformity of the side yard setback.

1249
01:57:51,548 --> 01:58:12,763
Correct you part yeah, so so Chris ordinarily for one and two family homes In some cases you can just make the changes by right or even if you can't Extending Or altering a non-conforming use

1250
01:58:13,697 --> 01:58:18,962
So long as you don't create a new nonconformity is something we can grant by special permit.

1251
01:58:18,982 --> 01:58:25,027
But in this case, you need the variance for the third floor because that's a new nonconformity.

1252
01:58:25,787 --> 01:58:26,908
So yeah, it's both.

1253
01:58:27,249 --> 01:58:34,275
It's special permit just for the general modification and then variance for the height.

1254
01:58:34,815 --> 01:58:37,998
Yeah, I guess that's my little bit of confusion there too because

1255
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:49,703
I know we've done a few of these in the past year that I've been on the board, and they're not really doing anything in terms of setback, right?

1256
01:58:49,723 --> 01:58:54,585
They're not demolishing or raising part of the...

1257
01:58:55,975 --> 01:58:56,535
walls, right?

1258
01:58:56,555 --> 01:59:00,717
They're just building up on the existing footprint of the house, so.

1259
01:59:01,777 --> 01:59:02,157
Correct.

1260
01:59:02,217 --> 01:59:10,700
So yeah, if they were changing the footprint of the house, it's likely that additional variances would be required in place of that special permit.

1261
01:59:12,921 --> 01:59:19,183
But by keeping the footprint the same in every dimension except for the number of floors,

1262
01:59:20,379 --> 01:59:22,181
They're not worsening it.

1263
01:59:22,221 --> 01:59:24,564
They're just modifying the structure.

1264
01:59:25,385 --> 01:59:27,247
The variance is for the third floor?

1265
01:59:27,267 --> 01:59:31,993
Specifically for the third floor, because currently this is a two-story house.

1266
01:59:35,817 --> 01:59:37,399
So it's special permanent variance then?

1267
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:38,460
Correct.

1268
01:59:39,141 --> 01:59:39,882
OK, thank you.

1269
01:59:42,363 --> 01:59:53,315
So what is the distinction between what the applicant is requesting and between that and for a three family?

1270
01:59:54,216 --> 02:00:01,785
I mean, does this addition would lead us to a three family or is it just basically the same or is there any distinctions?

1271
02:00:02,145 --> 02:00:16,611
Yeah, so I mean a three family would there be a number of requirements and I don't remember all of them off the top of my head, but notably there would need to be a third entry way and it would require a use variance.

1272
02:00:17,591 --> 02:00:24,614
So in this case, it's adding space in the form of an additional floor to an existing unit.

1273
02:00:27,485 --> 02:00:33,828
That's correct, and if you look at the floor plan, there's no separation between the second floor and the proposed third.

1274
02:00:34,348 --> 02:00:38,610
You go right up the stairs, there's no door to be closed, there's no kitchen.

1275
02:00:38,630 --> 02:00:46,433
We are proposing a small counter and bar sink up there just for convenience, but it will stay a two-family.

1276
02:00:46,974 --> 02:00:49,215
This is just for the owners expanding family.

1277
02:00:49,935 --> 02:00:51,896
It's giving them more room and staying in that effort.

1278
02:00:57,192 --> 02:00:59,113
All right, other questions from the board?

1279
02:01:06,775 --> 02:01:11,936
All right, not seeing any, so I'm going to open it up to public comment.

1280
02:01:12,136 --> 02:01:15,037
I know Jim Pedro wanted to speak.

1281
02:01:15,117 --> 02:01:17,678
So Jim, please go ahead, name and address for the record.

1282
02:01:19,035 --> 02:01:20,675
Hi, my name is Jim Boudreaux.

1283
02:01:20,695 --> 02:01:23,556
I live at 41 Pinker Street in Medford.

1284
02:01:24,456 --> 02:01:35,399
I'm the neighbor directly across, diagonally across from Doug, and I actually applied for a variance to do pretty much the exact same thing that Doug was doing.

1285
02:01:35,439 --> 02:01:41,581
I did that about five years ago, and it was approved, and basically for the same reasons, an expanding family.

1286
02:01:41,701 --> 02:01:42,841
I wanted to stay in Medford.

1287
02:01:44,101 --> 02:01:46,782
I think I've seen the proposed architectural

1288
02:01:47,722 --> 02:01:54,805
designed for the house, and it's aesthetically pleasing, and I think it conforms with the general appearance of the homes in the neighborhood.

1289
02:01:54,825 --> 02:02:02,088
And I just wanted to call in and voice my support for approval for this special permit.

1290
02:02:03,548 --> 02:02:03,748
Great.

1291
02:02:03,928 --> 02:02:04,428
Thank you, Jim.

1292
02:02:05,089 --> 02:02:05,429
Thank you.

1293
02:02:07,029 --> 02:02:16,073
Other members of the public, if you'd want to speak on this matter, please raise your hand on Zoom, type something in the chat, raise your hand on camera or email Dennis.

1294
02:02:22,737 --> 02:02:24,018
My name is Mike Tedding.

1295
02:02:24,418 --> 02:02:25,358
I spoke earlier.

1296
02:02:25,378 --> 02:02:27,579
Oh, okay.

1297
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:29,940
I thought you were actually involved in the project.

1298
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:30,901
I'm sorry.

1299
02:02:30,921 --> 02:02:36,043
I, I am, but I don't know if Doug gave you guys the letter with all the signatures on it.

1300
02:02:36,583 --> 02:02:36,843
Yes.

1301
02:02:37,183 --> 02:02:37,443
Yeah.

1302
02:02:37,483 --> 02:02:38,104
You have that.

1303
02:02:38,144 --> 02:02:38,684
We have that.

1304
02:02:38,724 --> 02:02:40,004
So yeah, I'll just say out loud.

1305
02:02:40,085 --> 02:02:43,326
So, uh, the, the board did receive a letter that's in the,

1306
02:02:44,715 --> 02:02:50,358
publicly available file for this case with the neighbors signatures.

1307
02:02:50,518 --> 02:02:52,199
So for support.

1308
02:02:52,359 --> 02:02:53,859
Okay, thank you.

1309
02:02:56,521 --> 02:02:59,302
Other members of the public would like to speak on this matter.

1310
02:02:59,322 --> 02:03:05,645
Right.

1311
02:03:05,725 --> 02:03:07,066
I'm not seeing any.

1312
02:03:09,697 --> 02:03:14,439
And I'm not seeing an indication from Dennis that there's any additional emails.

1313
02:03:14,819 --> 02:03:19,200
So chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

1314
02:03:20,961 --> 02:03:21,321
Motion.

1315
02:03:22,581 --> 02:03:22,902
Second.

1316
02:03:24,782 --> 02:03:25,222
Seconded.

1317
02:03:25,803 --> 02:03:26,063
All right.

1318
02:03:26,083 --> 02:03:28,063
We're going to take a roll call.

1319
02:03:28,123 --> 02:03:28,524
Chris?

1320
02:03:31,445 --> 02:03:31,605
Aye.

1321
02:03:32,405 --> 02:03:32,845
Andre?

1322
02:03:32,865 --> 02:03:33,865
Aye.

1323
02:03:35,046 --> 02:03:35,406
Mary?

1324
02:03:35,426 --> 02:03:35,486
Aye.

1325
02:03:36,106 --> 02:03:36,366
Yvette?

1326
02:03:37,046 --> 02:03:37,126
Aye.

1327
02:03:39,361 --> 02:03:39,641
Jim?

1328
02:03:40,482 --> 02:03:40,602
Aye.

1329
02:03:40,622 --> 02:03:42,202
All right.

1330
02:03:42,222 --> 02:03:43,303
We are now deliberating.

1331
02:03:43,323 --> 02:03:44,103
What do you think, folks?

1332
02:03:47,465 --> 02:03:48,946
Chris, go ahead.

1333
02:03:49,166 --> 02:03:59,891
I think it's a fine use of a two-family, a typical two-family that's converting up

1334
02:04:04,757 --> 02:04:16,967
Everyone, many friends of mine have gone through similar circumstances where they're looking at expanding their existing house.

1335
02:04:17,107 --> 02:04:32,840
It's a little bit of, you're not gonna match the typical aesthetic of West Medford or Medford in general, I think, by doing this, but there's not a lot of

1336
02:04:34,828 --> 02:04:35,668
options available.

1337
02:04:36,009 --> 02:04:44,292
So I can understand why this is desired, and I would support this.

1338
02:04:44,312 --> 02:04:46,613
All right.

1339
02:04:46,833 --> 02:04:47,193
Thank you.

1340
02:04:47,593 --> 02:04:49,714
Other thoughts from the board?

1341
02:04:50,775 --> 02:04:50,955
Andre?

1342
02:04:52,503 --> 02:05:06,984
Yeah, I mean, if we have to demonstrate a hardship for the variants, I mean, I would say that there's no other opportunity to expand on the site other than by going up.

1343
02:05:07,845 --> 02:05:19,541
And I don't think it is detrimental to the surrounding area, especially with the support of many of the neighbors that's been expressed.

1344
02:05:19,901 --> 02:05:24,147
And they're not requesting going up higher than what's allowed.

1345
02:05:25,508 --> 02:05:26,008
height wise.

1346
02:05:26,249 --> 02:05:43,379
So I would say, you know, this is a benefit in that even though it's not adding an additional unit of housing to Medford, it is creating kind of a, I assume it's a three bedroom unit, which, you know, we don't have a ton of in terms of apartments and in the city.

1347
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:44,960
Right.

1348
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:45,480
Thanks, Andre.

1349
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:45,761
Yeah.

1350
02:05:45,901 --> 02:05:47,582
And to that specific point, so

1351
02:05:48,688 --> 02:06:03,855
The position and shape of the existing structure can, in some cases, be associated with the hardship criterion for a variance.

1352
02:06:03,895 --> 02:06:05,816
So, you know, in this case,

1353
02:06:08,169 --> 02:06:24,384
The only option is to build up from the existing structure and given the current height and the limit on height, you know, to keep something under the height at two and a half stories, you'd have a much smaller third floor that would be

1354
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:34,460
as they mentioned, kind of a weird layout where you'd have like half of the house just kind of right up to 35 and then you just sort of drop down.

1355
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:47,842
So yeah, that would be like one potential avenue to associate a variance request with the shape and position of the existing structure.

1356
02:06:50,383 --> 02:06:52,583
Other thoughts from the board?

1357
02:06:54,732 --> 02:06:55,572
I want to apologize.

1358
02:06:56,113 --> 02:06:58,974
I lost internet for the five seconds you were talking.

1359
02:07:00,055 --> 02:07:01,755
So can you just read what you said?

1360
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:04,517
Yeah, I mean, I'm really boring to listen to that.

1361
02:07:04,537 --> 02:07:06,458
But I'll do my best to summarize.

1362
02:07:07,378 --> 02:07:19,564
So basically, so for the variance, we have to create some association between the relief being sought and a hardship and some other stuff.

1363
02:07:19,724 --> 02:07:22,346
And I'm just clarifying that.

1364
02:07:24,382 --> 02:07:45,054
the position and shape of the current structure, if they are, like, essentially unusual in a way that creates a hardship, if you literally apply the zoning ordinance, that's how you could establish meeting the criteria for variance.

1365
02:07:45,074 --> 02:07:46,495
So I was just saying, in this case,

1366
02:07:50,400 --> 02:08:04,390
Positions fixed so you can only go up and then with the existing height and shape, if you were to go two and a half stories, it's going to be a really awkward layout and it's going to be limited additional space.

1367
02:08:05,793 --> 02:08:06,173
Thank you.

1368
02:08:06,413 --> 02:08:07,773
And thank everybody for your patience.

1369
02:08:09,194 --> 02:08:14,955
And while they didn't go into it, I appreciate when folks want to stay in the neighborhood.

1370
02:08:15,075 --> 02:08:19,316
And I recognize in this housing market, that's not always possible.

1371
02:08:19,416 --> 02:08:25,838
And so I think this sometimes is the only way that you can really afford to.

1372
02:08:26,178 --> 02:08:35,580
And so again, while that wasn't presented as part of the hardship, I could only imagine it doesn't take a lot that that could be also part of that conversation.

1373
02:08:37,289 --> 02:08:38,009
All right, thank you.

1374
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:40,751
Other thoughts from the board?

1375
02:08:47,433 --> 02:09:04,021
All right, so just to reiterate, so the relief being sought here is a variance for the third floor, and then a special permit for the alterations to the existing non-conforming structure.

1376
02:09:06,262 --> 02:09:07,122
Chair awaits a motion.

1377
02:09:10,286 --> 02:09:10,646
Motion.

1378
02:09:12,006 --> 02:09:13,107
To what?

1379
02:09:13,727 --> 02:09:14,387
To approve.

1380
02:09:14,407 --> 02:09:16,587
Do I have a second?

1381
02:09:17,987 --> 02:09:18,307
Second.

1382
02:09:19,628 --> 02:09:21,988
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

1383
02:09:23,308 --> 02:09:23,708
Yvette?

1384
02:09:25,289 --> 02:09:25,449
Aye.

1385
02:09:26,229 --> 02:09:26,649
Jim?

1386
02:09:27,469 --> 02:09:27,589
Aye.

1387
02:09:28,269 --> 02:09:28,729
Mary?

1388
02:09:28,749 --> 02:09:29,489
Aye.

1389
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:30,650
Chris?

1390
02:09:31,590 --> 02:09:31,730
Aye.

1391
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:32,890
Andre?

1392
02:09:32,910 --> 02:09:33,710
Aye.

1393
02:09:34,570 --> 02:09:38,091
All right, so the variance and the special permit are approved.

1394
02:09:43,198 --> 02:09:47,360
All righty, just to sort of repeat what I sort of said just for the previous applicant.

1395
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:49,561
So I'll be writing up the decision.

1396
02:09:49,581 --> 02:09:51,462
It'll take me a little bit of time to do it.

1397
02:09:52,062 --> 02:09:54,283
When I finish that, it goes out for legal review.

1398
02:09:54,923 --> 02:09:57,484
And then once it comes back, then I send it out for signatures.

1399
02:09:57,904 --> 02:10:00,145
Once it's all signed, I will file it at the clerk's office.

1400
02:10:01,146 --> 02:10:05,527
And at that point, there's a 20 days appeals period that starts at that point.

1401
02:10:05,968 --> 02:10:08,749
And once those 20 days go by and there's no appeal,

1402
02:10:09,425 --> 02:10:10,947
then you can file for your building permit.

1403
02:10:11,227 --> 02:10:16,452
And you have to go and register with the Middlesex self-registered deeds.

1404
02:10:16,732 --> 02:10:21,116
And then once that's done, you go into the building department and you can get your building permit.

1405
02:10:21,176 --> 02:10:24,279
Awesome.

1406
02:10:24,860 --> 02:10:25,580
Thank you.

1407
02:10:26,221 --> 02:10:27,022
Thank you very much.

1408
02:10:27,722 --> 02:10:28,063
Thank you.

1409
02:10:29,424 --> 02:10:32,107
Can I ask one question to that last comment?

1410
02:10:32,127 --> 02:10:33,468
Sure.

1411
02:10:34,476 --> 02:10:36,396
What is that roughly?

1412
02:10:36,717 --> 02:10:44,658
I know you've got a lot in front of you, so I'm just trying to set expectations with the homeowner so that we're all on the same page.

1413
02:10:45,998 --> 02:10:56,601
I would say, just if I'm sort of doing the math, it takes me about two weeks to do this, which actually I just found the decision that was written for the 41 Pinkert.

1414
02:10:57,241 --> 02:10:59,321
So I think I can probably use that to work off from.

1415
02:11:00,101 --> 02:11:02,562
So I can get it probably done within a week or two.

1416
02:11:03,435 --> 02:11:08,459
After that, it's usually about a week turnaround for the legal counsel, and then a few days to sign.

1417
02:11:08,479 --> 02:11:15,745
So maybe, say, three plus weeks for that, and then another three weeks for that.

1418
02:11:15,785 --> 02:11:17,766
So maybe a month and a half, give or take.

1419
02:11:17,866 --> 02:11:18,006
OK.

1420
02:11:18,267 --> 02:11:20,889
So worst case, two months, hopefully.

1421
02:11:20,909 --> 02:11:23,130
I'm just trying to set expectations.

1422
02:11:23,170 --> 02:11:23,270
Yeah.

1423
02:11:23,290 --> 02:11:25,732
Worst case, two, but I'd say end of April.

1424
02:11:25,812 --> 02:11:26,113
Excellent.

1425
02:11:26,733 --> 02:11:27,614
That's the worst case.

1426
02:11:28,254 --> 02:11:28,855
Thank you, sir.

1427
02:11:30,217 --> 02:11:30,418
Yeah.

1428
02:11:30,478 --> 02:11:32,842
And just to be clear, like that's Dennis's estimate.

1429
02:11:32,942 --> 02:11:37,972
So there's like legal timelines and so on, but he will be making best efforts to stick to the estimate.

1430
02:11:39,339 --> 02:12:02,592
understood just trying to get some sort of rough timeline that's all yeah I mean honestly having that other decision will help because it's I mean I have to adapt it for the new zoning but that actually makes it actually easier because at that point it was all purely variances so now it's both variances and I just have to include that part yep okay thank you so much

1431
02:12:05,378 --> 02:12:07,218
Dennis, I think that was the last case.

1432
02:12:07,959 --> 02:12:10,159
If so, it was okay.

1433
02:12:10,239 --> 02:12:11,359
Any administrative updates?

1434
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:18,221
Just what I sort of mentioned earlier is that we're on the lookout for a 7th member.

1435
02:12:18,601 --> 02:12:18,881
So.

1436
02:12:20,902 --> 02:12:25,443
I talked to Alicia about that, and we're going to ask the mayor's office sort of put out a call.

1437
02:12:25,663 --> 02:12:26,323
So, but also.

1438
02:12:27,253 --> 02:12:33,796
Anyone who is looking at this, watching this tonight is interested, you know, please contact me and I'll tell you how to go about it.

1439
02:12:33,816 --> 02:12:38,177
D McDougall, I put at medford-ma.gov.

1440
02:12:38,277 --> 02:12:40,918
So, that is it.

1441
02:12:40,958 --> 02:12:47,041
Unfortunately, I kind of mentioned earlier that I was kind of, I had some family things going on this month.

1442
02:12:47,061 --> 02:12:50,302
So, I wasn't able to really even get to any minutes whatsoever, but everything is good now.

1443
02:12:50,422 --> 02:12:53,083
So, I should have stuff shortly because we figured out the,

1444
02:12:54,935 --> 02:12:59,078
to use AI for good in terms of writing meeting minutes and things like that.

1445
02:12:59,118 --> 02:13:03,301
So we've, one of my coworkers has sort of found some software that will help out with that.

1446
02:13:03,321 --> 02:13:10,326
So I think I should be able to get a bunch of them done in a relatively short timeframe.

1447
02:13:10,366 --> 02:13:12,867
So by the next meeting, I'll have a bunch of you guys to approve.

1448
02:13:12,887 --> 02:13:13,208
Hopefully.

1449
02:13:14,048 --> 02:13:15,249
Yeah, it sounds good, Dennis.

1450
02:13:15,869 --> 02:13:23,635
I do want to make sure we get them by our next meeting, but, um, but yeah, you got some cycles and be doable.

1451
02:13:23,715 --> 02:13:23,875
Great.

1452
02:13:25,490 --> 02:13:25,750
Okay.

1453
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:30,091
Um, so I think that brings us to the end of our agenda.

1454
02:13:30,171 --> 02:13:30,431
Yeah.

1455
02:13:30,471 --> 02:13:36,393
So Chris, if it's related to the meeting, you can ask it now or we could adjourn and then let me go.

1456
02:13:36,433 --> 02:13:36,713
Go ahead.

1457
02:13:36,773 --> 02:13:36,953
Yeah.

1458
02:13:37,493 --> 02:13:38,053
Oh yeah.

1459
02:13:38,153 --> 02:13:38,833
I'll wait till we turn.

1460
02:13:40,113 --> 02:13:40,494
Okay.

1461
02:13:41,134 --> 02:13:43,114
Uh, chair waits motion to adjourn.

1462
02:13:45,535 --> 02:13:47,275
Motion for the second.

1463
02:13:47,675 --> 02:13:48,175
All right.

1464
02:13:48,535 --> 02:13:49,916
We're going to take a roll call.

1465
02:13:49,996 --> 02:13:52,336
Chris Andre.

1466
02:13:52,356 --> 02:13:54,317
Hi, Jim.

1467
02:13:56,081 --> 02:13:56,582
Mary.

1468
02:13:57,204 --> 02:13:57,325
Aye.

1469
02:13:58,026 --> 02:13:58,428
Lizette.

1470
02:13:59,511 --> 02:13:59,631
Aye.

1471
02:14:00,212 --> 02:14:00,453
Mike.

1472
02:14:00,995 --> 02:14:01,135
Aye.

1473
02:14:01,636 --> 02:14:02,900
All right, we are now adjourned.

1474
02:14:03,582 --> 02:14:04,745
Good night, everyone.
