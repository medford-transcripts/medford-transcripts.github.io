1
00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:02,772
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

2
00:00:02,872 --> 00:00:03,832
[SPEAKER_26]: Hello, everybody.

3
00:00:03,872 --> 00:00:05,513
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going to get started.

4
00:00:05,953 --> 00:00:07,274
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you all for being here.

5
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:11,735
[SPEAKER_26]: Whether you're here with us in person, in Medford Public Library, or joining us on Zoom.

6
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:13,796
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm Niska Collins.

7
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:15,937
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm the Vice President of the Medford City Council.

8
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:18,018
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm the Chair of the Finance and Programming Committee.

9
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:24,240
[SPEAKER_26]: That is the committee where all of our funding goes to the student, at the workshops, the funding meetings, and public meetings.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,961
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's why I'm here at this table tonight.

11
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:52,317
[SPEAKER_26]: And and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and

12
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:59,779
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, as many of you know, for example, many of you know, right, we've been involved in the first part of our donation process.

13
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:04,080
[SPEAKER_26]: This year, we've been going team-by-team through a lot of parts of the city.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,662
[SPEAKER_26]: So, most of the, most of the, parts of the, all of them have been geographically based.

15
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:13,883
[SPEAKER_26]: Different neighborhoods, different borders, different areas.

16
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:18,945
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, we went out to Denver and talked about what these donations should look like.

17
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:29,634
[SPEAKER_26]: The topic that we are just at the very, very, very beginning of tonight is not about geography per se.

18
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:35,078
[SPEAKER_26]: It is about parking and transportation demand management strategies.

19
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:52,310
[SPEAKER_26]: We are talking about parking and other ways of managing transportation systems throughout the city are one of the things that I'm telling you has limited jurisdiction.

20
00:01:52,930 --> 00:02:00,835
[SPEAKER_26]: So we also want to have a conversation with the community and then the planning committee and then the community court about

21
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:07,257
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's re-evaluate those rules as well as we've re-evaluated zoning and other geographies.

22
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:15,279
[SPEAKER_26]: We do not have a proposal for updated parking and transportation and amenity strategies.

23
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,239
[SPEAKER_26]: That is on purpose.

24
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:24,341
[SPEAKER_26]: We want the goals of tonight to be to define the terms that we are going to be using when we talk about parking and transportation and amenity.

25
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:39,167
[SPEAKER_26]: define which of them, or which strategies, actually are having credibility, and what stands outside of credibility, and what we found to be credible, and what we think is very relevant and very important, and we actually will continue to work with them.

26
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:51,472
[SPEAKER_26]: And make sure that as we go forward into what will be many additional public meetings about these topics that we're all new, to at least all accept using the same terms and finding the same thing.

27
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:56,483
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I'm getting a report that the audio and the zoom is very bad.

28
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,624
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we're trying to troubleshoot that.

29
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:02,906
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just wanted to give you that heads up, because you may be asked to repeat some of this.

30
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:13,269
[SPEAKER_16]: My only thought is that I switch from the library guest network to the guest to network.

31
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:22,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Zoom, is this sound better?

32
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:29,049
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a graduate student in the other room who can tell me if the sound is better for any reason from one voice to the other.

33
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:30,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Weird.

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,991
[SPEAKER_16]: It says, what I'm being told is that I'm coming through fine, but you weren't.

35
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:37,091
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's try it.

36
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:37,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

37
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:46,512
[SPEAKER_26]: I also, yeah, actually, I think maybe you had it too close and you actually wanted it a little bit further away.

38
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:48,193
[SPEAKER_26]: Try it.

39
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,242
[SPEAKER_26]: say a little further away.

40
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:54,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that sound better?

41
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:56,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Give that a try and see what we get.

42
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:57,464
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

43
00:03:58,525 --> 00:03:59,505
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry for the repeated test.

44
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:00,866
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to make sure that you can hear me.

45
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:06,669
[SPEAKER_26]: Honestly, there wouldn't be a public meeting if there wasn't somebody telling you what to do.

46
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,950
[SPEAKER_26]: OK, I'm not going to repeat all of that, I know.

47
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,691
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just going to scroll back 40 times.

48
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:23,516
[SPEAKER_26]: The goal of tonight's meeting, we're intentionally not coming in with a proposal for parking or transportation demand.

49
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:36,986
[SPEAKER_26]: The goals of tonight are to all get on the same page about what kind of ways do you know you need to participate in management that was written in our zoning code, what zoning can talk and what can't.

50
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:47,291
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sure that we will get a lot of really doubtful questions and comments about parking and transportation that we will be able to plan as important and relevant but not specified zoning.

51
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:50,012
[SPEAKER_26]: We want to make sure that we all get on the same page about

52
00:04:50,572 --> 00:05:12,632
[SPEAKER_26]: the constraints of knowing how the language will be published, and I had a conversation with a student who said that as we go forward, which are certainly many additional public meetings about that topic, that we are all needing the same name and we use the same term to the extent that we can, and just trying to start off on the same but we're the language that we're using, how the language is going to be introduced,

53
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:25,522
[SPEAKER_26]: Some strategies, some examples from neighboring communities that might be forums are discussing, but the other really important part of sourcing materials, unfortunately, is view ball.

54
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:30,806
[SPEAKER_26]: The forums are getting into the degree of needs in that infirmary setting.

55
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:40,092
[SPEAKER_26]: We would like to hear your questions, your comments, your concerns, the things that you are excited about, the things that you would never like to hear about again.

56
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:50,620
[SPEAKER_26]: This has been a collaborative process from the beginning of the term, and it's really important to us to hear what you have to say before we judge.

57
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,983
[SPEAKER_26]: With that, I'm going to turn it over to Director Hahn.

58
00:05:57,885 --> 00:05:58,345
[SPEAKER_17]: You go first.

59
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:07,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, so I have a theory that it's picking us up through the computer, whatever you did just.

60
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:12,062
[SPEAKER_17]: It's no longer up there.

61
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:18,804
[SPEAKER_17]: They are having trouble hearing us through the zoom.

62
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:21,886
[SPEAKER_17]: And my theory is there's no puck here like there was last time.

63
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:26,507
[SPEAKER_17]: But it says meeting owl as the mic.

64
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:28,828
[SPEAKER_20]: I know we're going to alternate, but I need to

65
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:35,846
[SPEAKER_17]: speaking, they could hear me clearly through the zoom, but not when Kit was speaking.

66
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:38,207
[SPEAKER_20]: So unless you decide to be very close to that.

67
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:41,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Being a mic as well.

68
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:43,669
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah, we don't have a speaker.

69
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:44,990
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's also lost the video.

70
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,930
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I'm saying.

71
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,111
[SPEAKER_22]: The video no longer works.

72
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:47,631
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

73
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:49,212
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's not green anymore.

74
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:50,992
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I just pushed the power button.

75
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:52,433
[SPEAKER_22]: I know because I turned it off.

76
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:57,435
[SPEAKER_20]: And then if I can get internet to my laptop, I can provide an audio source.

77
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:04,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so we might have a... All right, sorry to those on Zoom.

78
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:07,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully y'all can hear me.

79
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Kevin, our video guy, just returned.

80
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:23,138
[SPEAKER_16]: He had to deal with an emergency at another meeting, and he's gonna try and get some stuff updated for us, and we don't know why the Apple stopped.

81
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:29,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I have a theory.

82
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,300
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go.

83
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,361
[SPEAKER_16]: I fixed the owl.

84
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:32,221
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go.

85
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:32,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

86
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:49,549
[SPEAKER_16]: So some of what we were saying, and hopefully you'll be able to hear as Emily and Paola speak, we are not going to repeat everything that Kit said, but we're working on a larger planning project, a larger zoning project for the city.

87
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,330
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're all here because we said we were going to talk about parking.

88
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:58,769
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the things that we wanted to talk about was to hear from people first before we put a proposal out.

89
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:20,224
[SPEAKER_16]: So the intention tonight is to give you information about what the current zoning rules are, to give you definitions about what a lot of the terms that we're using and some of the definitions has to do with different tools that can be used in zoning.

90
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:27,237
[SPEAKER_16]: And then give you some frameworks to talk about to give us some input and feedback and we'll go back and forth between in the room.

91
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,541
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think people can tell there about 30 people on the zoom.

92
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:34,465
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to give use this analogy.

93
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:36,528
[SPEAKER_16]: So, when we were designing our park.

94
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:45,172
[SPEAKER_16]: We did something there where what we did was we surveyed the park and we measured the park and we said, this is how big the park is and what we have to work with.

95
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,913
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we went out in the park and we said to people, what would you like to see here?

96
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:50,734
[SPEAKER_16]: If this was a blank slate.

97
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:55,555
[SPEAKER_16]: And by the way, here are some types of things that one could put in a park if you'd like to see any of them.

98
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:00,316
[SPEAKER_16]: And we heard from people and we had people tell us about what they'd like to see in the park.

99
00:09:00,737 --> 00:09:02,997
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we did a couple of different layouts.

100
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:05,878
[SPEAKER_16]: And we went back to the public and we said, here's

101
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:08,889
[SPEAKER_16]: here's some things based on what we heard you say.

102
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,230
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we heard back from them and then we designed the final thing.

103
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:22,792
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the analogy here is that what we're doing is giving you the size, like this is what's in, this is some tools, some things that could be there.

104
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:29,314
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it's like you tell us what people want to hear and see in the city of Medford.

105
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:30,934
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's some of the idea.

106
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:32,654
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm gonna hand this over to Emily.

107
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,215
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I do that, I am watching

108
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:43,874
[SPEAKER_16]: to get people to tell me, again, if you're having trouble with the sound, let us know.

109
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:48,175
[SPEAKER_16]: And Christian is in the other room monitoring the sound for us as well.

110
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:50,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Alicia.

111
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:52,396
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, welcome to everybody.

112
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,556
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Kim Williams.

113
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:54,636
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a nurse associate.

114
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:57,317
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm here with my colleague, Pilar Arnaz-Martinez.

115
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:03,298
[SPEAKER_22]: She will do most of the presentations at this stage, in terms of where we are in the process.

116
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:05,756
[SPEAKER_26]: So you need to turn on again.

117
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:10,318
[SPEAKER_22]: And there we go.

118
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,959
[SPEAKER_22]: So I keep bringing it up.

119
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:19,743
[SPEAKER_22]: This has always has been a long process with a lot of different geographic discussions.

120
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:22,804
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the first really helpful discussion.

121
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:27,766
[SPEAKER_22]: And I want to reiterate, we each have any recommendations for tonight.

122
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:32,389
[SPEAKER_22]: In terms of proposals for parking, we wanted to hear from people first.

123
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:32,709
[SPEAKER_22]: So

124
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,397
[SPEAKER_22]: You can go to the next slide, please.

125
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:38,720
[SPEAKER_22]: So we've been introducing everything.

126
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,021
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm very aggrieved.

127
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,783
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to go over the process and timelines and meetings.

128
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,604
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to turn it over to Carolyn.

129
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,226
[SPEAKER_22]: And at the end, we mostly want to hear from you.

130
00:10:47,506 --> 00:10:49,727
[SPEAKER_22]: So these are the meetings we've done since March.

131
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:53,570
[SPEAKER_22]: We've been actually working on this since last spring, a little bit before this time.

132
00:10:54,878 --> 00:11:02,482
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the first way we introduce topics normally is we take it to the planning and permitting committee of the city council first.

133
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:06,324
[SPEAKER_22]: In this case, we haven't actually taken this topic to them yet.

134
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:10,426
[SPEAKER_22]: So we will do on Wednesday, we'll give them a debrief from this meeting.

135
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:18,530
[SPEAKER_22]: Then the next thing that we do is once the planning and permitting committee feel that it's in a stage at which it needs to move into the next step,

136
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,328
[SPEAKER_22]: They take whatever we have worked with them on, they take it to the city council city council or the community development board.

137
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:35,578
[SPEAKER_22]: So those are the dates you see there and our next meeting with them is June 18, which is next Wednesday, we'll be talking about the residential districts again and also a us.

138
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:43,804
[SPEAKER_22]: Community Development Board is the one that holds the first formal public hearings at which input is taken.

139
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:55,036
[SPEAKER_22]: The Planning and Permitting Committee is a public meeting and people are more than welcome to share any of their thoughts, concerns about the Community Development Board's formal public hearing.

140
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:56,037
[SPEAKER_22]: And next slide, please.

141
00:11:56,603 --> 00:12:11,863
[SPEAKER_22]: And then finally we've had these points at which we come out and have a presentation and listening session, as we're doing tonight and this is the last one of this fiscal year, which is June 30 is on parking and information and management so welcome.

142
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for joining us.

143
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:23,039
[SPEAKER_22]: For those of you who like things in cables rather than timeline, but those are both perfectly valid ways of looking at it.

144
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:30,625
[SPEAKER_22]: 6-11 this Wednesday, we have the institutional district slash Tufts University introduction to the planning and permitting committee.

145
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:32,247
[SPEAKER_22]: We've already had a public meeting on that.

146
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:44,756
[SPEAKER_22]: parking and transportation demand management, we'll probably be talking a little bit more about the other quarters, Community Development Board on the 18th, and then possibly again on the 25th, that has not yet been confirmed.

147
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:54,723
[SPEAKER_22]: So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Bella to give us that high level framework of parking now in Bedford, other communities and some definition of terms.

148
00:12:55,758 --> 00:13:04,865
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of information on these slides that you'll probably want to read afterwards as well and they will go up on the zoning page on the city's website after this meeting.

149
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:12,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I suggest that you might want to have the mic horizontal, do you want to just have it in here and move it closer to her so she doesn't have to hold it?

150
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:20,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you all hear me okay?

151
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:21,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes?

152
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect.

153
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,863
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope that we will get from some of their issues.

154
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:29,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for being here.

155
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:31,004
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of people.

156
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:32,725
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

157
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:35,907
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some seatings in the front and some over there.

158
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:39,369
[SPEAKER_14]: So if people, you get tired, please come and sit.

159
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:44,792
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to try to do it as fast as possible, but clear as possible.

160
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:52,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and I'm really sorry, but this topic is a little bit dense, so don't expect a lot of graphics and things like that.

161
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:56,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I will try my best to not get you very bored.

162
00:13:56,953 --> 00:14:07,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I want to make sure of what are we discussing today and what we will discuss some topics in a later moment, but not today.

163
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:12,158
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will start discussing the off-street parking requirements, and that is

164
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:14,218
[SPEAKER_13]: for private property.

165
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:19,921
[SPEAKER_13]: We won't be discussing public parking, parking standards, or curb management.

166
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:27,245
[SPEAKER_13]: And this curb management is something a little bit new that is starting, or at least certain areas is starting.

167
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:39,712
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's about the curb management, how we seek to optimize, allocate, and manage that curb space for different uses that we have of deliveries, logistics, parking, bikes.

168
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,093
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are getting a lot of things going on,

169
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:44,757
[SPEAKER_13]: in our cars and sidewalks.

170
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:47,679
[SPEAKER_13]: So we want to have it as neat as possible.

171
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:52,963
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would also be part of it, but not today.

172
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:58,847
[SPEAKER_13]: So parking management, I would say that parking is really essential for the transportation system.

173
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:04,711
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to take into account that a car is parked 90% of the time.

174
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:05,772
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not being used.

175
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:07,814
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's taking a lot of the space.

176
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:14,713
[SPEAKER_13]: You also need the parking where you live, where you work, where you do your entertainment.

177
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:23,957
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of spaces that should be maybe for the public that are being taken by a private property.

178
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:30,860
[SPEAKER_13]: So the parking convenience affects that we can relate to destinations and affects overall accessibility.

179
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:36,883
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we want is that parking management could have all those policies and programs

180
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,532
[SPEAKER_13]: that gives us more efficient use of the parking resources.

181
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:58,961
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we have this parking management that is applied properly, we know that we can significantly reduce the number of parking spaces that are required in a particular situation, providing more variety in economic, social, and environmental benefits.

182
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:03,463
[SPEAKER_13]: So parking management is about making it as efficient as possible.

183
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:21,852
[SPEAKER_13]: We are in a transition where we are shifting from an old and more conventional situation towards a new, we call it paradigm, it's a little bit fancy word, to a new way of doing things.

184
00:16:22,353 --> 00:16:33,235
[SPEAKER_13]: And why we are shifting to a new paradigm is because of a lot of research in studies and a lot of analysis and information from data and statistics that are giving us this new shift.

185
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:42,104
[SPEAKER_13]: How we're doing things in a more conventional way is that we have a lot of abundant and free advertisers.

186
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:45,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Those were the goals for parking.

187
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:26,149
[SPEAKER_13]: of seeing parking after a lot of the studies and analysis and data and statistics, what is being proven to be better is for the new goal should be, is to provide optimal parking to price, supply and price, sorry.

188
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:29,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Consider too much supply as harmful as too little.

189
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:35,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Prices are too low as harmful as those that are too high.

190
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,545
[SPEAKER_13]: to be more in that medium area.

191
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:45,589
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to strive to use parking facility, again, efficiently as possible.

192
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Consider full lots as something to be acceptable.

193
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:54,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Emphasize sharing of parking facilities between different destinations and users.

194
00:17:55,614 --> 00:18:00,717
[SPEAKER_13]: And favor to charging for parking facility cost directly to users.

195
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:08,324
[SPEAKER_13]: And here we have some comments on that, but basically that is the idea.

196
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:12,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we okay?

197
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:13,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

198
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:20,772
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of the strategies that we've seen, and this is the most conventional, is to have parking minimums.

199
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:22,973
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you would have in your current zoning.

200
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:27,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Every use is going to have a parking minimum requirement.

201
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:30,658
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have to provide those minimum parking standards

202
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:32,779
[SPEAKER_13]: so that you get your building permit.

203
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:42,061
[SPEAKER_13]: It's usually calculated by a ratio, and from that ratio, you get the number of apartments that you need.

204
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:49,203
[SPEAKER_13]: These usually reflect the maximum supply that could be needed on a BCS day anticipated.

205
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:52,904
[SPEAKER_13]: They correlate the 85% bill on the BCS.

206
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:57,806
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's calculated to have your BC day of commercial, for example,

207
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:00,972
[SPEAKER_13]: completely full or almost completely full.

208
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:04,995
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where these minimums start, which it's not really minimums.

209
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:18,563
[SPEAKER_13]: So they are always usually going toward oversupply in many ways, derived from parking demand studies that were mostly performed in automobile dependent locations.

210
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sorry.

211
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:27,848
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we need to understand that excessive parking requirements are waste resources.

212
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:36,494
[SPEAKER_13]: increase the money and land devoted to parking facilities and by that increasing automobile use and sprawl.

213
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:39,056
[SPEAKER_13]: So things that we don't really need.

214
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:51,486
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we're going to do now is quite fast looking at the current Medford parking requirements and then looking at other areas that are nearby and what are those requirements.

215
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:52,827
[SPEAKER_13]: So for

216
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,890
[SPEAKER_13]: And this depends, as I said before, by uses.

217
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,492
[SPEAKER_13]: And they give us the minimum use of practice.

218
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,313
[SPEAKER_13]: So residential uses.

219
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:03,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we're switching.

220
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:07,997
[SPEAKER_22]: But it gives you time to look at the slides.

221
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:09,458
[SPEAKER_22]: A little awkward I had done.

222
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:14,661
[SPEAKER_22]: There you go.

223
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:26,448
[SPEAKER_19]: Check microphone one, two.

224
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:03,417
[SPEAKER_19]: Check microphone one, two, mic one, two, check one, two, check mic one, two.

225
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:09,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

226
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:14,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want me to test or is it okay?

227
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:18,412
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, perfect.

228
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:22,517
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're back.

229
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:25,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys for your patience.

230
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:30,403
[SPEAKER_13]: This hybrid is always a little, it has its complications.

231
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:42,792
[SPEAKER_13]: So for the residential uses, I hope you've seen, it depends on the type of residential building type that we get different parking requirements.

232
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:48,457
[SPEAKER_13]: So for single family is two parking places per dwelling unit.

233
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:51,117
[SPEAKER_13]: All other residential types are 1.5.

234
00:21:51,157 --> 00:21:54,158
[SPEAKER_13]: And now we have two exceptions.

235
00:21:54,258 --> 00:22:01,199
[SPEAKER_13]: So if it is affordable housing units, they can go lower to 0.5 per dwelling unit.

236
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:10,001
[SPEAKER_13]: And if it's located within a half a mile of a high frequency transit, then they can also lower to 0.8 per dwelling unit.

237
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:12,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, this is in your current.

238
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,082
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not a proposal.

239
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:13,802
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what it is.

240
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:23,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, and we did a little bit of summary because every if you go to the table of uses table, a, I think it is, you will see the parking.

241
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:30,592
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you can see really for each of the uses, we didn't bring that because then we will be here forever.

242
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:35,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Office uses, they are all one per 350 square foot.

243
00:22:37,014 --> 00:22:38,894
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to multiply, that's your ratio.

244
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:42,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Then for retail and services, we have different.

245
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:48,116
[SPEAKER_13]: For mainly all retail sales is one per 350.

246
00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:52,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Convenience is a little bit lower demand, is one per 500.

247
00:22:52,877 --> 00:22:55,758
[SPEAKER_13]: Neighborhood retail, this is very understandable.

248
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,739
[SPEAKER_13]: People, you expect them to walk to your neighborhood retail.

249
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:00,380
[SPEAKER_13]: That's even lower.

250
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,241
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one per 750.

251
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:06,004
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we have other retail uses, which is the same.

252
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:07,325
[SPEAKER_13]: You're one per 350.

253
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:15,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I don't have it here by but because it's a little bit buried in your zoning from city staff.

254
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:18,452
[SPEAKER_13]: They also told and inform us that if.

255
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:29,561
[SPEAKER_13]: any use and that is non-residential is low is smaller than 5000 square foot then you don't need to provide any parking.

256
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:37,127
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's something that is again currently in your zoning and that is used as an incentivize for a small business.

257
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,231
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all non-residential.

258
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:44,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

259
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:51,009
[SPEAKER_13]: So your parking requirements, now we are going to look into other communities that are around Cambridge and Somerville.

260
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:53,110
[SPEAKER_13]: They do not have any parking requirement.

261
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,951
[SPEAKER_13]: They delete the minimums.

262
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:57,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you have Everett.

263
00:23:58,412 --> 00:24:02,975
[SPEAKER_13]: They do have a transportation demand management, which is quite interesting and in-depth.

264
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:06,796
[SPEAKER_13]: We will look at those in a later meeting.

265
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:14,101
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now what they have is you're going to always see residential, office, and retail.

266
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:17,963
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we have residential uses for all residential type.

267
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:20,105
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't do any distinctions.

268
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:26,869
[SPEAKER_13]: It's two per dwelling, office one per 500, so a little less than what Medford has, and retail is 300.

269
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:30,131
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a little bit higher than what Medford has.

270
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:40,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Arlington, all the residential types is one parking place per dwelling unit, that is lower than what Medford has, but without any specific reductions.

271
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:47,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you have for office, one per 500, less than what Medford has, and then the retail goes a little bit over 300.

272
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:53,079
[SPEAKER_13]: For Malden, we have residential uses.

273
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:56,059
[SPEAKER_13]: They do it a little bit different, not recommending this one.

274
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,860
[SPEAKER_13]: All residential types is one per bedroom.

275
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,981
[SPEAKER_13]: That is really, well, different.

276
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:08,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Office uses is higher, is one per 250, and retail as well.

277
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:10,603
[SPEAKER_13]: This is quite high, is one per 250.

278
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:18,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Looking at Newburyport, they have different for this district.

279
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:22,629
[SPEAKER_13]: So the smart growth district has residential uses.

280
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:26,551
[SPEAKER_13]: That is, it's quite interesting in the sense how they divide them.

281
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:32,534
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's that depending on the size of the residential, you get different.

282
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:42,060
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a little what Melvin tries to do, but it just gets that if you have three bedrooms or four bedrooms, single family house, it's going to be too, too high.

283
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:50,667
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a way of dividing them more for studio, one bedroom, two dwelling, two bedroom, 1.3, three bedroom, 1.5.

284
00:25:52,809 --> 00:26:01,196
[SPEAKER_13]: And then for retail and restaurants is less than what we've seen in the other communities, one per seat, six seats of occupancy.

285
00:26:01,216 --> 00:26:03,518
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a little bit different instead of

286
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:14,659
[SPEAKER_13]: by square footage is by users and the outdoor cafe they do the same, and then all the other uses is two per 1000 square foot so one per 500.

287
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:20,322
[SPEAKER_13]: So as you can see, everyone does a little bit different.

288
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:22,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them are similar.

289
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:28,005
[SPEAKER_13]: And what we want to see is what parking strategies are out there.

290
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:29,685
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are a lot.

291
00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:35,267
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can do, for example, update parking minimums.

292
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:38,649
[SPEAKER_13]: We have those ratios that are quite high.

293
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:43,010
[SPEAKER_13]: We can do some studies and try to lower those parking minimums.

294
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,811
[SPEAKER_13]: We will see a little bit more in depth.

295
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:52,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Then increased capacity of parking facilities, maximum parking ratios, residential requirements, we will see what that means.

296
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we have reductions.

297
00:26:56,175 --> 00:27:11,241
[SPEAKER_13]: So all the different reductions that can be applied to parking requirements and that is for example proximity to public transport, affordable housing, additional bicycle parking, shared car service, mobility as a service, and dual use.

298
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:12,502
[SPEAKER_13]: I will explain all of this.

299
00:27:14,003 --> 00:27:22,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we have also, if we provide alternative parking facilities, if we have a transport demand management, that's another one that we can do.

300
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,413
[SPEAKER_13]: And finally, eliminate, delete parking minimums.

301
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:37,502
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to look a little bit on how those, I want them to, we wanted to divide them in easy way to

302
00:27:40,217 --> 00:27:41,278
[SPEAKER_13]: to structure this.

303
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:55,136
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are some things that we can do in the short term that do not need a lot of study behind them, and we will understand this a little bit better later, that can be done almost immediately.

304
00:27:56,797 --> 00:28:00,399
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are others that are going to need a little bit of more time.

305
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:08,642
[SPEAKER_13]: We could implement now, but results are going to be more in the longer term.

306
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:11,383
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have short-term changes.

307
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:16,045
[SPEAKER_13]: We can have update parking minimums, increased capacity of parking facilities.

308
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:16,926
[SPEAKER_13]: I will explain.

309
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:19,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let's see, like this.

310
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:24,431
[SPEAKER_13]: maximum parking ratios and residential requirements.

311
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:26,133
[SPEAKER_13]: So what is this?

312
00:28:27,194 --> 00:28:30,016
[SPEAKER_13]: So update parking minimums, it doesn't mean that we erase them.

313
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:41,968
[SPEAKER_13]: We just see based on studies that actually measure the supply and the demand, the real demand for parking, so that we know what is the optimal requirement, right?

314
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:45,972
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is, and this is on the, I'm not going to get in there.

315
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:49,876
[SPEAKER_13]: This is in the presentation so you could look at this.

316
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:53,419
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a Metro Boston perfect fit parking initiative.

317
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:56,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford is not really in it.

318
00:28:57,008 --> 00:29:08,278
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really the ones beside them, but you can see the real demand that are usually more around 0.5, 1.5 per dwelling unit.

319
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:12,703
[SPEAKER_13]: More or less depending on where you are, those will be the real demands.

320
00:29:13,263 --> 00:29:23,015
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you get into this website, you can see that all the different multifamily buildings, they have what is the actual real demand.

321
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:31,885
[SPEAKER_13]: And so what you can do is after that study, we update your parking minimums according to real demands.

322
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:38,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Another thing that we can do in the short term is increase capacity of parking facilities.

323
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:51,612
[SPEAKER_13]: What that is, does it mean is mainly your size for parking place, your dimensions are for quite big cars are not done for compact vehicles.

324
00:29:52,353 --> 00:30:06,089
[SPEAKER_13]: In city areas, we will use a lot more, and because they have a better use of the gas, they are more efficient, more sustainable, we tend to use more and more compact vehicles, and so they

325
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:13,913
[SPEAKER_13]: we would like to increase that demand for compact vehicles.

326
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:20,935
[SPEAKER_13]: So to add a minimum of compact vehicles so that the space can be more efficient.

327
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:29,357
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now Medford has in their current zoning that up to 30 can be designed for compact cars.

328
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:42,842
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, Cambridge has that up to 50 can be designated for compact cars, and some have a minimum, which is around 20 and 30 to be compact cars.

329
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:49,925
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really start reducing that space that is taken by parking when it's not really needed.

330
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Another strategies that can be applied in the short term is maximum parking ratio.

331
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:59,107
[SPEAKER_13]: So we know that there are minimum, what if we do maximums?

332
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:06,473
[SPEAKER_13]: So that we limit the construction of parking lots that are really not necessary and reducing that oversupply.

333
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:10,596
[SPEAKER_13]: This happens in Boston, for example, they do have those maximum parkings.

334
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:17,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them do not have the minimum and only have maximums, and some of them have minimums and maximums.

335
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:29,096
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are really making sure that is not an oversupply of parking, or just that there is a lot of space that is not having any designation.

336
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:35,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we have parking ratios specific to residential types and this is basically what new report does.

337
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:52,636
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you have, instead of being for the type of dwelling, to have it by size, so that if it's a studio or a one bedroom, you can actually have less minimum requirements than if it's a five bedroom.

338
00:31:53,236 --> 00:32:01,702
[SPEAKER_13]: So by that size, we can actually be more specific on the building type for the parking requirement.

339
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:04,795
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are all the short ones.

340
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:09,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go for a little bit of those midterm, and that is reductions in parking requirements.

341
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:14,359
[SPEAKER_13]: You will see them in both because some of those reductions can actually be done as a short.

342
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:27,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

343
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:29,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's gone.

344
00:32:39,438 --> 00:32:41,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

345
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:50,477
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will look into all those reduction of parking requirements and then what does it mean that alternative parking facilities

346
00:32:51,952 --> 00:33:02,215
[SPEAKER_13]: So reduction for parking, what we want is to reduce those parking minimums whenever the development will meet certain requirements.

347
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:09,638
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we do here is to make instead of more citywide, what we do is more site specific.

348
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:29,272
[SPEAKER_13]: So, for example, if you are near to a public transport stop and we can define what does it mean if it's only high transit, if we have different percentages, if we are near a bus or near high transit, high frequency transit.

349
00:33:30,072 --> 00:33:42,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so in this case, Medford only applies this to the residential use, so they require that 0.8 per dwelling unit that we talked about when he's in proximity to that high frequency transit.

350
00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:46,101
[SPEAKER_13]: We could do this for any kind of use.

351
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:48,402
[SPEAKER_13]: So you calculate all your minimums.

352
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:52,586
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's a mixed use, it will be residential plus the commercial.

353
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:57,209
[SPEAKER_13]: And then what we can do is having a percentage that can be reduced.

354
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:11,880
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, for example, 30% of all the parking requirements, if you live near a half a mile of high-frequency transit, can be reduced, and those 30 are taken out for all of the different uses, not only for residential.

355
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,782
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have affordable housing.

356
00:34:15,963 --> 00:34:18,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford has a reduction from 1.5 to 0.5.

357
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:30,115
[SPEAKER_13]: What I really want to address here is that affordable housing, usually lower income families, medium income families, are more dependent on cars.

358
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:33,196
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is not really fair.

359
00:34:33,276 --> 00:34:49,381
[SPEAKER_13]: We do this because then the cost of the building and the development is less, but we are affecting somehow those families, because usually if you are a high income, you can choose where you live, and usually you can choose that close to your work.

360
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:56,708
[SPEAKER_13]: If we provide additional bicycle parking, you could have certain reduce, you can have certain reduction.

361
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:08,391
[SPEAKER_13]: If we provide car sharing service, and usually we would recommend to be at least for a 10-year contract, this is, sorry.

362
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:13,453
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you hear me in here in the room?

363
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:14,453
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, okay, perfect.

364
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:18,274
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the Zoom, yeah, I know, but I also want to make sure.

365
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:23,204
[SPEAKER_13]: We are getting there.

366
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:41,414
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we have a car sharing service, and this is that there is available in-house or nearby some kind of car sharing, then you could reduce those requirements.

367
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:44,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Car sharing is a service that allow users by

368
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:55,807
[SPEAKER_13]: membership to rent cars for very long, sorry, for very short periods of time and you didn't have to worry about hours or pick out locations.

369
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,611
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mobility as a Service, this is actually very new.

370
00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:06,597
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a new approach for urban transportation and what it does is having all of this in one app

371
00:36:07,178 --> 00:36:21,147
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is really for very big developments where they can provide an app and you can have your car sharing, you can have bikes, you can have transit memberships, and from your app, you can do all of it.

372
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:28,512
[SPEAKER_13]: So it really, what it does is give that option so that personal vehicle, it's less required.

373
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:37,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we have another one that is this dual use.

374
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, and I hope it's easy to understand, otherwise I have a lot of information.

375
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:50,046
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's any question about any of this, I just want to go fast.

376
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:55,209
[SPEAKER_13]: But the dual use is mainly, it's only for mixed use buildings.

377
00:36:55,669 --> 00:37:07,937
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you have different uses, what you would do is in the same building, share those parking places because with the uses that share different peak demands.

378
00:37:08,137 --> 00:37:08,858
[SPEAKER_13]: So for example,

379
00:37:09,578 --> 00:37:16,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Residential and office usually works very well because when you're at the office, you usually do not use your residential parking.

380
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:24,261
[SPEAKER_13]: So usually you could reduce in a mixed use building those not entirely, but that you could share some of those.

381
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:41,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Alternative parking facilities, this is basically that you have a contract with a garage, a parking facility, private, public, that you provide your requirements.

382
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:43,228
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, in another facility.

383
00:37:43,268 --> 00:37:55,462
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is not a reduction because it's not reducing anything is that you just, um, gather your, um, provide your requirements with a walking distance, um, in other facility.

384
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:08,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so alternative parking facility is that you provide those requirements in a different parking garage than your development.

385
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:13,801
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're not doing it in-house, if you're externalizing, can you say externalizing that?

386
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:17,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, off-site.

387
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:21,487
[SPEAKER_13]: To another garage, but we need to make sure that it's in a walking distance.

388
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:28,207
[SPEAKER_13]: So long-term strategies, we have the transport demand management.

389
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:29,907
[SPEAKER_13]: This is very complex.

390
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:33,328
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not really going in deep or in detail.

391
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:42,070
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just going to define it, and we will present a lot more information in the next meetings.

392
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:45,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we have the eliminating parking minimums.

393
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:52,333
[SPEAKER_13]: So transportation demand management, what it does is give

394
00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:59,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, okay.

395
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:21,227
[SPEAKER_13]: It's to provide a menu of programs and policies that will aim to expand those mobility options and will support active mobility, riding transit, and using alternative work schedules while decreasing reliance on needing to drive alone.

396
00:39:22,148 --> 00:39:37,040
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is to say, basically, that what certain, and this is only target to certain developments, it's not for everyone, is usually when they hit a certain threshold of intensity parking.

397
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:41,503
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are many ways to go into a demand management.

398
00:39:42,724 --> 00:39:48,289
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's mainly to say, we have a lot of parking, can we, in a way,

399
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:56,518
[SPEAKER_13]: do certain policies to provide the community with other alternatives.

400
00:39:57,118 --> 00:40:07,831
[SPEAKER_13]: So an example would be I am an office building and the owner will give the employees transit

401
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:12,736
[SPEAKER_13]: passes for free so that they can use it.

402
00:40:13,897 --> 00:40:21,105
[SPEAKER_13]: So incentivizing all kinds of active mobility or non-drive alone option.

403
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:27,528
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we have the last one, which is eliminate minimum parking requirements.

404
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:39,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is it in the long term strategies is because to apply this citywide, what we need is to make sure that we provide everyone the property transit options.

405
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,365
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we have

406
00:40:42,822 --> 00:40:49,045
[SPEAKER_13]: public transit that connects to the usual job and living areas.

407
00:40:49,686 --> 00:41:01,292
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have good bike system, if we have good pedestrian network, then at a certain point, you could eliminate citywide those minimum requirements.

408
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:06,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Otherwise, it's not really recommended.

409
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:07,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Um.

410
00:41:09,405 --> 00:41:10,605
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is very quickly.

411
00:41:10,825 --> 00:41:13,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are we looking into this into parking regulations?

412
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:16,848
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a lot of information about this.

413
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:23,931
[SPEAKER_13]: If anyone is interested, we will post a lot of studies that have been published by transportation agency agencies.

414
00:41:24,631 --> 00:41:28,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Um and but so we're going to give only the main topics.

415
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:32,514
[SPEAKER_13]: We're doing this because we want your community input.

416
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:33,335
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one.

417
00:41:34,235 --> 00:41:36,337
[SPEAKER_13]: We do this because of climate resiliency.

418
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:38,419
[SPEAKER_13]: We do this because of public health.

419
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,982
[SPEAKER_13]: And we do this because of efficient land use.

420
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:44,405
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, yeah.

421
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:49,370
[SPEAKER_22]: And just as we transfer over to hearing from you instead of us recording in progress.

422
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:52,556
[SPEAKER_22]: the geographic areas for the zoning.

423
00:41:52,917 --> 00:42:06,284
[SPEAKER_22]: We have heard a lot of questions, concerns, thoughts, goals, desires on parking and it just made sense to give you an overview of the terminology, an overview of some of the options, and then hear your thoughts.

424
00:42:06,445 --> 00:42:08,966
[SPEAKER_22]: So we are at that point where we want to hear your thoughts.

425
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,427
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to turn it over to Alicia.

426
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:23,567
[SPEAKER_22]: to moderate because we are going to be doing what we've done in the past with hybrid meetings, which is switch between people in the room and people, people in this physical room, I should say, and people who are in the virtual room.

427
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,390
[SPEAKER_22]: So Alicia, turning it back to you.

428
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:37,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great and so really the idea here tonight is to hear people's thoughts and their concerns about zoning and parking.

429
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:45,196
[SPEAKER_16]: So we will ask people to use the mics so that people can hear you on the zoom.

430
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:53,041
[SPEAKER_16]: So, if people want to say something, if you can raise your hand and either going to let me out, or you're going to have to run around with the Mike.

431
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:56,423
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we're going to let Councilor Collins run around with the Mike.

432
00:42:57,284 --> 00:43:04,669
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, we'll go you in the back and then we'll work our way forward.

433
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:09,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine's more of a clarification.

434
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,763
[SPEAKER_05]: this, what we're looking at now, is this for new construction or existing dwellings coming into the town, which was not clarified at the beginning at all?

435
00:43:19,103 --> 00:43:21,104
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I can, I will answer that.

436
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:27,006
[SPEAKER_22]: So we are talking about zoning and what zoning does is it's when there's a change to a property.

437
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:28,767
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's this isn't retroactive.

438
00:43:29,187 --> 00:43:35,089
[SPEAKER_22]: It's if somebody is going to redevelop their property, then that's when these would come into place.

439
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:36,790
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

440
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:45,433
[SPEAKER_16]: I would just add on that it's new, or if, say, you have a building, but you want to expand that building or do a major change to that building.

441
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:50,735
[SPEAKER_16]: But nobody has to do anything if they weren't otherwise doing it correct.

442
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:51,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

443
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:57,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So another silly question is, how do you have a 0.5 vehicle in a dwelling or a 0.8?

444
00:43:58,875 --> 00:43:59,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

445
00:43:59,255 --> 00:44:01,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So those... Every dwelling has at least one car.

446
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:02,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

447
00:44:02,376 --> 00:44:07,077
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's intended for dwellings that are more than single family.

448
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:08,397
[SPEAKER_16]: And so you would round up.

449
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:11,958
[SPEAKER_16]: So today we allow 1.5 for a multi-dwelling.

450
00:44:11,978 --> 00:44:19,460
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you have a two-family house, 1.5 per dwelling means, I'm not doing math, you have to have three parking spots.

451
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:28,470
[SPEAKER_16]: But like that, and if it was close to transit and was 0.8, it would round up to one.

452
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:36,891
[SPEAKER_16]: If it was a single family, although single family is still two, it would round up to two spots for the two units.

453
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:43,112
[SPEAKER_16]: But where it really comes into play is when you have a 200 unit building, then the 0.8 is a big deal.

454
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:46,593
[SPEAKER_16]: 0.8 is very different from one when it's a 200 unit building.

455
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,291
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Kit's going to man.

456
00:44:51,712 --> 00:44:55,095
[SPEAKER_16]: And then after this, we now have two hands on the Zoom.

457
00:44:55,116 --> 00:44:56,497
[SPEAKER_16]: So why don't we start with the one in the room?

458
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,979
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm John Anderson, 102 Brooks Street.

459
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:06,906
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like to question the assumption that higher income families are less car dependent and less affluent.

460
00:45:08,267 --> 00:45:14,433
[SPEAKER_23]: Part of my reason for questioning that is I don't remember whether it was in the Medford housing production plan

461
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:27,357
[SPEAKER_23]: with a comprehensive plan, but there was a statistic that 68% of the people who worked outside of the city got to work by car, usually alone.

462
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:31,358
[SPEAKER_23]: And that also reflects my personal experience.

463
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:36,600
[SPEAKER_23]: My wife and I lived in Medford for 25 years, and we both worked.

464
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:44,442
[SPEAKER_23]: And I alone, once for two and a half years, had the opportunity to use public transportation.

465
00:45:45,053 --> 00:45:48,094
[SPEAKER_23]: because we mostly worked in suburbs on 128 or 495.

466
00:45:49,494 --> 00:45:51,714
[SPEAKER_23]: So we were absolutely dependent on cars.

467
00:45:51,754 --> 00:45:52,934
[SPEAKER_23]: There was just no option.

468
00:45:55,515 --> 00:46:01,816
[SPEAKER_23]: And also, I know on my street, very few people use public transportation.

469
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:07,937
[SPEAKER_23]: They're mostly professional, and professional folks have that same challenge.

470
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:12,158
[SPEAKER_23]: And the idea that we can move to be closer to work

471
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:22,955
[SPEAKER_23]: doesn't really fit well with people who have children in the schools or want to develop a sense of community and put in roots in the community.

472
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:28,380
[SPEAKER_23]: And just because, you know, I don't work for Wang any longer and I work for digital, I'm going to pack up and move.

473
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,002
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think that's something most people want to do.

474
00:46:34,063 --> 00:46:41,525
[SPEAKER_22]: So to your point, everybody, each person has their own individual experience of how they move through their day.

475
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:48,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Statistically, those with lower incomes tend to have fewer choices on a number of levels.

476
00:46:48,987 --> 00:46:50,308
[SPEAKER_22]: And one of those is transit.

477
00:46:50,748 --> 00:46:55,429
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember working in a city in Connecticut at the very beginning of my planning career.

478
00:46:56,169 --> 00:47:01,131
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was a place that had excellent commuter rail access.

479
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:17,980
[SPEAKER_22]: And there was a housing authority development right next to it and the city planner at the time told me, most of the people who lived in the housing authority wouldn't take the train because none of their jobs were on the train and so they actually had a higher requirement.

480
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:37,639
[SPEAKER_22]: Your, your job was not on a train and I think we're, we've all been familiar with the fact that Boston has a hub and spoke system for our region which does make public transit harder for almost everybody, but if you look nationwide, statistically, the, there's more choice for people who have higher incomes

481
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:42,140
[SPEAKER_22]: the information that we were pulling shows the impact of those choices.

482
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,220
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's why we said that.

483
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:55,923
[SPEAKER_22]: However, there are also areas within Medford, clearly from the work that we've done, from what we've heard from people that have better access to transit and those areas in Medford that do not have good access to transit.

484
00:47:56,303 --> 00:48:00,104
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's what we're trying to hear today is get a sense from everybody in the room.

485
00:48:00,204 --> 00:48:03,925
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you for your comments, because your experience is important for us to hear.

486
00:48:04,045 --> 00:48:04,945
[SPEAKER_22]: So we appreciate it.

487
00:48:05,565 --> 00:48:06,866
[SPEAKER_22]: You wanted to go into the room next?

488
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:20,233
[SPEAKER_08]: And also another reason why low-income folks tend to be more dependent on cars is because they often have shift works.

489
00:48:20,373 --> 00:48:27,137
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not working that 9 to 5 schedule, because that's when the peak hours for the buses and trains are.

490
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:33,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, tomorrow morning, I need to go downtown for a meeting, and there's plenty of buses that will get me down there for 9 a.m.

491
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:36,883
[SPEAKER_08]: and back by the end of business.

492
00:48:37,643 --> 00:48:41,425
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I was trying to come back, I was working in a restaurant.

493
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:44,206
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I was in grad school, I did work in restaurants downtown.

494
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:52,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember missing the last train and basically crying because all my money and tips was going to go to that taxi ride back to Somerville, Medford area.

495
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:55,372
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just another reason why there's more car dependency.

496
00:48:57,205 --> 00:49:01,686
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have the studies and the graphs, so we will show them in later moments.

497
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:10,668
[SPEAKER_13]: But yes, also, they tend to work multiple jobs that are in different areas, not really near one area.

498
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:10,968
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

499
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:18,410
[SPEAKER_22]: OK, so we are ready for the first person coming in from Zoom.

500
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:21,411
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're just going to make sure that we

501
00:49:22,817 --> 00:49:28,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Do things correctly here, so I'm going to unmute her because I also have to mute myself at the same time for this to work.

502
00:49:33,324 --> 00:49:36,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Cheryl, we're going to unmute you.

503
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, can you hear me?

504
00:49:42,351 --> 00:49:48,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so Cheryl Rodriguez 21 Park Street.

505
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:53,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just checked with the assessor this week and we have 42,246 cars registered in the city with only 24,572 households.

506
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:57,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So that means for every adult living in the city, 81% of them own a car.

507
00:50:05,207 --> 00:50:05,747
[SPEAKER_09]: One car.

508
00:50:06,488 --> 00:50:13,051
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm concerned that now that the tough students are gone, that if we start doing parking studies, we're going to miss thousands of cars.

509
00:50:13,151 --> 00:50:16,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the students that live next door to me have six cars.

510
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:20,994
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're all gone when you do the parking study, then you're going to miss those cars.

511
00:50:21,114 --> 00:50:23,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's even worse in South Medford.

512
00:50:23,956 --> 00:50:24,096
[SPEAKER_09]: So

513
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm concerned about that.

514
00:50:26,678 --> 00:50:30,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also concerned about the fact that not all the streets are equal.

515
00:50:30,439 --> 00:50:37,182
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go to the proposed NR1 neighborhoods, what they have in common is that the majority of them don't have any cars parked on the street.

516
00:50:37,622 --> 00:50:44,345
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you go to the NR3s and the UR1s and UR2s, you'll see that there's cars lining both sides of those streets.

517
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:47,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it's definitely not one size fits all.

518
00:50:47,807 --> 00:50:52,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm concerned that we're trying to fit a round peg in a square hole

519
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:57,841
[SPEAKER_09]: and that it's really not going to work out for us because we're not even going to get accurate car counts from the start.

520
00:50:59,164 --> 00:50:59,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

521
00:51:02,779 --> 00:51:03,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Cheryl.

522
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:11,982
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that I may, I'm just checking with Emily if she wants to clarify, but when we talk about studying parking, we're not talking about car counts on the streets.

523
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:13,983
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going out and counting the cars.

524
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:28,888
[SPEAKER_16]: We are looking at other communities and what programs are working elsewhere and looking at some more big picture things, but we don't have, it's not actually, you're right, it's not a good use to actually go out and count cars on the street.

525
00:51:29,704 --> 00:51:34,880
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm very concerned that you're going to lose a lot of strategies because if you look at a city that doesn't have a large.

526
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,984
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

527
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:43,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, my name is Courtney, but hello.

528
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,526
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm at forty nine Edwards street.

529
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:52,115
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there's gonna be a lot of conflicting interests kind of going on tonight, but I'm just here to talk on behalf of stormwater considerations.

530
00:51:53,597 --> 00:51:58,443
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a stormwater engineer and training and but I'm just speaking as somebody who lives in Medford.

531
00:52:00,425 --> 00:52:06,477
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just highly encourage all of this to consider the stormwater implications of mandates related to park minimums.

532
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:09,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially as new permits are coming out from EPA.

533
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,963
[SPEAKER_15]: So stormwater runoff quality is a known problem for Medford.

534
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:15,664
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm in a hill.

535
00:52:16,044 --> 00:52:18,206
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had like a flooded basement before.

536
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:21,869
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure other people have experienced those kinds of issues.

537
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:25,753
[SPEAKER_15]: But we know those are going to get worse with climate change.

538
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:30,657
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's a concern for the city based off of the climate change assessment.

539
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:40,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Based on that assessment, they've acknowledged that the system was older and undersized, which is consistent with what I've seen in other cities.

540
00:52:42,155 --> 00:52:44,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Any increase in impervious surfaces is making that worse.

541
00:52:46,558 --> 00:52:52,101
[SPEAKER_15]: So anything we can do to reduce the impervious surfaces in the city is probably going to be beneficial.

542
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:56,784
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, again, there's a lot of other issues here, but that's just something I would consider.

543
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,943
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing is that these new permits are going to be a pretty significant cost burden on the city.

544
00:53:04,444 --> 00:53:13,331
[SPEAKER_15]: In order to reduce the amount of phosphorus going into the Mystic River, the TMDL is going to be implemented based on the new EPA permit.

545
00:53:15,012 --> 00:53:24,559
[SPEAKER_15]: And the estimate within the actual TMDL was a $20 to $100 million cost for the city of Medford based on the 2019 estimates.

546
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,243
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would just say that as we continue doing this, we should keep in mind these stormwater costs.

547
00:53:32,612 --> 00:53:33,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you.

548
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:35,755
[SPEAKER_16]: And yes, it's a helpful comment.

549
00:53:36,275 --> 00:53:39,098
[SPEAKER_16]: So now let's go to one online, and then we'll go to one in the room.

550
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:44,263
[SPEAKER_16]: So the next person online is Zachary Chertog.

551
00:53:44,323 --> 00:53:46,565
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to ask you to unmute after I mute myself.

552
00:53:50,569 --> 00:53:51,430
[SPEAKER_32]: Can you hear me?

553
00:53:53,878 --> 00:53:55,439
[SPEAKER_32]: well, I lit up green, so I'm going to assume so.

554
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,201
[SPEAKER_32]: Zachary Chartok at 5 Almond Street.

555
00:53:58,241 --> 00:54:08,046
[SPEAKER_32]: So my question is that when there's a contention that the city has more parking than uses, is the data that you're looking at shows that that contention is evenly distributed across the city?

556
00:54:08,606 --> 00:54:14,790
[SPEAKER_32]: Because as is often the case, uneven distribution often gets mismatched to actual local demand on the ground.

557
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:22,414
[SPEAKER_32]: So when the data is looked at from the top down, it looks like there's more than is needed, especially with when you don't have historical design uniformity.

558
00:54:23,354 --> 00:54:27,757
[SPEAKER_32]: And are zoning uniformity that's implemented those parking allotments over time.

559
00:54:27,777 --> 00:54:36,161
[SPEAKER_32]: So, before I add the comment to that, I'm just curious when the city and the consultants are commenting on that.

560
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:41,744
[SPEAKER_32]: Have you looked at the how well the current supply is aligning to the current demand?

561
00:54:41,764 --> 00:54:46,587
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to make sure.

562
00:54:51,397 --> 00:54:53,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, sorry, I was waiting for the thumbs up here.

563
00:54:53,398 --> 00:55:01,482
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to make sure that we're sort of talking about the same things like it's easy for us to look at supply and demand for large apartment buildings.

564
00:55:02,442 --> 00:55:08,725
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that I got that data about a year ago when we were doing the some large apartment building permitting in city of Medford.

565
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:17,495
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, let's go find out what the other large apartment buildings in the city are actually using as like the actual usage in those buildings for ratios.

566
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:21,820
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that's easy to kind of get.

567
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,587
[SPEAKER_16]: I think what's really of concern to a lot of people is what about the one to 10 unit buildings?

568
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:35,911
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's where and so I don't want to say trust the professionals, but when you are talking about 200 units, there's laws of averages.

569
00:55:35,951 --> 00:55:42,755
[SPEAKER_16]: You can go look at the other 200 unit buildings, see how much parking they're actually using historically, how much parking they're using.

570
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:49,798
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can make a rational decision about the new 200 or 250 unit building that is coming in.

571
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:55,081
[SPEAKER_16]: The hard part and the important part for zoning is really when we're looking at these

572
00:55:56,482 --> 00:56:01,766
[SPEAKER_16]: 1 to 10 unit, 1 to 20 unit buildings where you're not going to have laws of averages.

573
00:56:01,786 --> 00:56:09,351
[SPEAKER_16]: You're going to have actual people living in that building in an actual location, and their behavior is going to be different if they're near a green line stop.

574
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:13,634
[SPEAKER_16]: If they're near the orange line stop but can't get there because they have to cross Route 16,

575
00:56:15,175 --> 00:56:18,456
[SPEAKER_16]: or if they're up in West Medford or North Medford.

576
00:56:19,216 --> 00:56:21,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Then we're saying, well, what about two and three bedroom units?

577
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,478
[SPEAKER_16]: What about some small multifamily four-bedroom?

578
00:56:25,978 --> 00:56:34,620
[SPEAKER_16]: When you have one parking spot per unit, you can allow a certain amount of stuff on that site.

579
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:39,642
[SPEAKER_16]: When you require two spots per unit, which by the way, was actually the rule in Medford until

580
00:56:42,203 --> 00:57:02,943
[SPEAKER_16]: 2021 when it was changed in the recodifications it really decreases the amount of units like that you can fit because now every unit has to also have two parking spots that you can access independently from each other versus like is one enough or is one and a half the right number because in a three unit building do you really think that

581
00:57:03,403 --> 00:57:09,225
[SPEAKER_16]: every single like all say there are six adults in a three unit building, all six are each going to have their own car?

582
00:57:09,745 --> 00:57:11,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Or do you think that some will and some won't?

583
00:57:11,966 --> 00:57:13,927
[SPEAKER_16]: And does it depend on where in Medford they are?

584
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:20,349
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's really helpful for us to hear from residents about your experiences in different parts of Medford.

585
00:57:21,189 --> 00:57:26,731
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, I'll just share that like in my neighborhood, you can't get around without a car for every adult.

586
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:27,972
[SPEAKER_16]: My neighbor has five cars.

587
00:57:29,895 --> 00:57:44,484
[SPEAKER_16]: But there are other parts of the city where I know that there are residents in Medford who are living car-free very happily, and there are residents who are trying very hard for families with children to get around with one car, and the other parent uses a cargo bike and bikes the kid around.

588
00:57:44,704 --> 00:57:46,225
[SPEAKER_16]: We know these things are happening.

589
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:48,866
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, what are the rules we should put in place?

590
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:53,009
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Zachary wasn't actually finished, but I'm going to give this back to Emily to say something.

591
00:57:53,609 --> 00:58:00,654
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to add something for Zachary, which is, like all consultants, we have a scope of what we need to address.

592
00:58:01,054 --> 00:58:05,678
[SPEAKER_22]: But one of the things we wanted to do was hear the questions and concerns tonight.

593
00:58:06,138 --> 00:58:09,801
[SPEAKER_22]: And that would let us know what areas we need to do a deeper dive on.

594
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:16,506
[SPEAKER_22]: So we've already been doing a lot of research, but it made sense to listen here first and find out what questions people had.

595
00:58:16,646 --> 00:58:21,809
[SPEAKER_22]: So the more questions we're hearing, the better for our sense of what we need to do next.

596
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:22,390
[SPEAKER_22]: Give it back.

597
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:25,692
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's just go, Zachary, did you have something more you wanted to add?

598
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:26,792
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll mute myself.

599
00:58:27,993 --> 00:58:28,774
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'll make it quick.

600
00:58:28,834 --> 00:58:31,195
[SPEAKER_32]: And Alicia, thank you for the clarification there.

601
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:37,699
[SPEAKER_32]: So leaning into a couple of things and sort of feeding off the comment about the tough students as well.

602
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:47,565
[SPEAKER_32]: So first, echoing the commuter issue, my offices personally have never been located in a direction that public transit goes in, or even in a location that often is accessible by it.

603
00:58:47,645 --> 00:58:50,567
[SPEAKER_32]: So I've had a very similar experience to the gentleman that spoke before.

604
00:58:51,887 --> 00:58:58,752
[SPEAKER_32]: I've always had to commute out to I-95 or 128, which is where, if you're in engineering and or tech, that's where most of your work is.

605
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:04,115
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's true for a lot of folks in Medford's tax bracket.

606
00:59:05,016 --> 00:59:06,336
[SPEAKER_32]: I've tried non-car options.

607
00:59:06,496 --> 00:59:08,598
[SPEAKER_32]: They just were not timely or cost viable.

608
00:59:09,518 --> 00:59:19,665
[SPEAKER_32]: And in addition to that, I'm someone who requires access to facilities like hospitals and specialty facilities that just aren't accessible by transit, including anything in the Leahy Health System.

609
00:59:20,605 --> 00:59:42,433
[SPEAKER_32]: um yeah yep i'm younger but i have to face that i deal with a condition that i have to get taken care about that way um somewhat of as a trade-off that i'm kind of excited to explore though is that for example you know is that is exploring combinations of these methods in each neighborhood i live in east medford you know over near glenwood on the north side of salem street and

610
00:59:43,233 --> 00:59:47,254
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, I, I will admit that we've got narrow streets that have parking on both sides.

611
00:59:47,314 --> 00:59:47,794
[SPEAKER_32]: It's tricky.

612
00:59:48,915 --> 00:59:53,176
[SPEAKER_32]: But, for example, if the lot on Lambert street were to convert to a garage.

613
00:59:53,896 --> 00:59:57,997
[SPEAKER_32]: When my partner commutes here, because he has no other way to get here other than to drive.

614
00:59:58,477 --> 00:59:59,478
[SPEAKER_32]: We often use my car.

615
00:59:59,518 --> 01:00:01,358
[SPEAKER_32]: Most of the time, his car sits street side.

616
01:00:01,418 --> 01:00:04,139
[SPEAKER_32]: If I could put his car in a garage and get that off the street.

617
01:00:04,819 --> 01:00:07,680
[SPEAKER_32]: And maybe my street goes down to one side of the street parking.

618
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,081
[SPEAKER_32]: That's a great combination solution for something like that.

619
01:00:11,201 --> 01:00:17,703
[SPEAKER_32]: And then to free up those spaces for the people who actually need to park their cars here, because they don't have any other option.

620
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:27,947
[SPEAKER_32]: So, I like the fact that we're exploring combination solutions, but I would still err on the side of caution when fully eliminating minimums based on the fact that we are.

621
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:40,313
[SPEAKER_32]: In an interstitial and transitory zone here, where you've got people commuting in both ways and the T just cannot be relied on to change its network even in a 30 year time frame cost wise.

622
01:00:41,094 --> 01:00:44,976
[SPEAKER_32]: To meet by directional demands between 128 and downtown Boston.

623
01:00:47,357 --> 01:00:47,697
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

624
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you.

625
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,462
[SPEAKER_16]: And Paula wants to add something before we go to the next in the room and.

626
01:00:58,536 --> 01:01:10,242
[SPEAKER_13]: So the idea, and it's exactly what you said, is to create a menu where we can have different options, to create a lot of options, depending on, and make it more geographically specific.

627
01:01:10,922 --> 01:01:17,165
[SPEAKER_13]: One of those would be that alternative parking facilities, or yeah, depending on where you are.

628
01:01:18,726 --> 01:01:20,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Other thing that is very interesting and

629
01:01:21,407 --> 01:01:46,819
[SPEAKER_13]: it might be for all those businesses is the TDM, so the transportation demand management, where the same employers could have a shuttle alternative so that there is more crossing between not only going to Boston because everything is very centralized into Boston, but people that work in Cambridge and Somerville, Arlington, so that those shuttles could be.

630
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:48,620
[SPEAKER_13]: The idea is to

631
01:01:49,460 --> 01:02:13,819
[SPEAKER_13]: have a transportation demand association where a lot of those employers, business owners, et cetera, could bring other alternatives shuttle and do new transit ways instead of waiting for Massachusetts State Transportation to bring those in.

632
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:15,040
[SPEAKER_13]: That can be very interesting.

633
01:02:17,641 --> 01:02:20,465
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going to get this gentleman over here and then we're going to go back over to that side.

634
01:02:22,707 --> 01:02:23,669
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm Paul Morgan.

635
01:02:23,709 --> 01:02:24,770
[SPEAKER_30]: I live on Brewster road.

636
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:31,759
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd like to make some observations about parking in existing neighborhoods and how it's going to be possibly affected by some of this.

637
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:34,202
[SPEAKER_30]: Some of this development.

638
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:41,863
[SPEAKER_30]: It's pretty easy to see by walking through neighborhoods that some neighborhoods, the on-street parking is almost all gone.

639
01:02:42,624 --> 01:02:46,647
[SPEAKER_30]: So they don't, whatever they have, they don't have off-street parking that's ample now.

640
01:02:48,028 --> 01:02:55,874
[SPEAKER_30]: So people don't necessarily park in front of their house, and maybe sometimes they come home from work and they have to park a block away.

641
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:56,575
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know.

642
01:02:56,655 --> 01:02:57,636
[SPEAKER_30]: It certainly could happen.

643
01:03:00,678 --> 01:03:08,666
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that we should change the minimum requirement for new development back to 2 units to 2 spaces per unit.

644
01:03:09,126 --> 01:03:12,269
[SPEAKER_30]: Like, ever it has and, like, we just found out Medford used to have.

645
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:19,295
[SPEAKER_30]: Because otherwise you're going to impact these other existing neighborhoods of.

646
01:03:20,036 --> 01:03:26,101
[SPEAKER_30]: single-family and two-family homes by putting more street parking in the area.

647
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:37,931
[SPEAKER_30]: Those people who are living in a building with one per unit and somebody wants to get a second car, they're going to be driving around the neighborhood taking up the existing parking spaces.

648
01:03:38,471 --> 01:03:46,158
[SPEAKER_30]: I think the developers should pay for the cost of additional parking on their property because they're the ones making all the money and selling these brand new dwellings.

649
01:03:46,962 --> 01:03:55,369
[SPEAKER_30]: And it shouldn't be put on the existing neighbors who are already here and already established.

650
01:03:57,110 --> 01:04:02,114
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think that's pretty much what I want to say.

651
01:04:02,234 --> 01:04:09,380
[SPEAKER_30]: And well, what I want to say is that situation isn't fair in my mind.

652
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:19,781
[SPEAKER_30]: for somebody to come in, make a lot of money, go away, and then leave the rest of the neighborhood's inconvenience for the rest of their lives here.

653
01:04:20,561 --> 01:04:20,941
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

654
01:04:22,421 --> 01:04:23,081
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

655
01:04:23,121 --> 01:04:24,281
[SPEAKER_22]: We appreciate your comments.

656
01:04:35,423 --> 01:04:38,364
[SPEAKER_16]: We have several hands in the room and then we'll get to one online.

657
01:04:42,803 --> 01:04:45,245
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi, Harrison Green to Ronaleigh Road.

658
01:04:45,706 --> 01:04:51,951
[SPEAKER_29]: I have a comment on the concept, as I understand it, of induced demand on parking.

659
01:04:52,291 --> 01:04:58,697
[SPEAKER_29]: And can any of you up front talk about what that means in terms of the city and parking?

660
01:05:01,003 --> 01:05:17,175
[SPEAKER_29]: Induce demand, meaning if we don't know the term, if we have more, our understanding now of highway design, for example, is that if we put more lanes, more traffic comes so that in the same way, I would expect that if we were to build more parking, we would get more cars.

661
01:05:17,716 --> 01:05:20,358
[SPEAKER_29]: That's the product of of that decision.

662
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:28,044
[SPEAKER_29]: So we can make that decision, but we should expect that we will get more gridlock that we will have more people making that.

663
01:05:29,303 --> 01:05:37,605
[SPEAKER_29]: societally easier decision to drive because of public transit not being exactly what we want it to be.

664
01:05:38,385 --> 01:05:45,766
[SPEAKER_29]: But I have another comment on that.

665
01:05:45,826 --> 01:05:47,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, if I find where we are.

666
01:05:47,547 --> 01:05:47,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

667
01:05:51,528 --> 01:05:56,369
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is very complex.

668
01:05:59,851 --> 01:06:01,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Could we see it maybe?

669
01:06:03,053 --> 01:06:08,236
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is the cycle of automobile dependency.

670
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:10,018
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also called induced demand.

671
01:06:11,058 --> 01:06:28,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, what we know for how we have been dealing conventionally with parking and with traffic and congestions, et cetera, it's that we find always that we come back to the same place.

672
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:42,580
[SPEAKER_13]: So we add lanes, people start to buy more cars, use more cars, and before it's even paid, the new investment, we are already in the same point.

673
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:46,683
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is called this, there is also called some kind of

674
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,245
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called a paradox.

675
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:52,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's paradox of race, if I remember correctly.

676
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:55,514
[SPEAKER_13]: But yes, we are looking into this.

677
01:06:55,654 --> 01:06:57,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, that's why we have all the reductions.

678
01:06:58,718 --> 01:07:04,105
[SPEAKER_13]: We do not think that Medford is ready for eliminating all the parking minimums in citywide.

679
01:07:04,665 --> 01:07:11,847
[SPEAKER_13]: that's something that I and there are going to be a lot of urban planners that might defend that.

680
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:25,272
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that Medford is ready for that but I do think that there is a lot to do with the reductions so that we can really support the real demand of what the city has instead of really going over

681
01:07:27,493 --> 01:07:46,121
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to look into this also goes into air pollution, into water pollution, into a lot of other costs that taxpayers, non-users of cars are also going to be paying and that are a lot more costly than if we look into doing things properly in the first place.

682
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:48,742
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yes, we are aware of this.

683
01:07:49,562 --> 01:07:54,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we do have a lot of, as I said, a lot of studies that have been done.

684
01:07:54,626 --> 01:07:57,189
[SPEAKER_13]: This comes from this comes from, for example.

685
01:07:57,649 --> 01:08:00,211
[SPEAKER_13]: The Institute for transportation and development policy.

686
01:08:00,631 --> 01:08:02,293
[SPEAKER_13]: These are really things that.

687
01:08:02,813 --> 01:08:08,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Transportation agencies are telling us, um, so we are looking into those and yeah.

688
01:08:10,817 --> 01:08:34,575
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll add because I know you have a follow up that unfortunately when you get to something like the sort of the higher levels of automobile policy, it is of course not on Medford alone right as you know we're in a region and the region is having some of that demand in there so yeah, this, this looking into what current best practices are from transportation.

689
01:08:35,956 --> 01:08:40,542
[SPEAKER_22]: agencies is one of the things we're doing to try and understand what the impact on Medford would be.

690
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:43,226
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't want to stop you from your next question.

691
01:08:43,246 --> 01:08:44,648
[SPEAKER_29]: Thanks.

692
01:08:44,668 --> 01:08:50,816
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm hearing in the strategies, the short, medium and long term, that there's

693
01:08:51,997 --> 01:09:10,968
[SPEAKER_29]: that these are things that could be done by the developer and not by the city or not at this time, because we can spend as much time as we have to make increasingly productive tweaks to the system, or to the general rules.

694
01:09:11,008 --> 01:09:19,273
[SPEAKER_29]: We can make smaller and smaller districts that have tighter and tighter or stranger guidelines to capture whatever is happening in that neighborhood.

695
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:26,202
[SPEAKER_29]: Could this not be done by the developer in the time when that change is being made?

696
01:09:26,402 --> 01:09:33,268
[SPEAKER_29]: And how has that change been adopted or what's the product of that change where it has been adopted?

697
01:09:34,659 --> 01:09:35,700
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's a great question.

698
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:41,842
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the things that we were all talking about in our check-in and our prep for this meeting is the idea of a menu of choices.

699
01:09:42,663 --> 01:09:55,569
[SPEAKER_22]: That menu of choices may be based on the use type, it may be based on the development size, it may be based on the neighborhood characteristics, which could be proximity to transit or lack of proximity to transit.

700
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:59,454
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the idea is after hearing the comments tonight.

701
01:09:59,874 --> 01:10:13,151
[SPEAKER_22]: The next stage is delving further into what other communities have been doing and where they've been successful and where they haven't and what those lessons are, but it would be the developer right is what we're trying to do with the zoning is set.

702
01:10:13,852 --> 01:10:27,064
[SPEAKER_22]: the rules, the guidelines, the options, and then the developer comes forward and when they make their application to the city, they're saying, these are the menu choices I have chosen based on what was available to me and so that is part of that.

703
01:10:27,665 --> 01:10:30,087
[SPEAKER_22]: And as you say that can be tweaked over time.

704
01:10:30,707 --> 01:10:34,351
[SPEAKER_22]: You know I remember what 10 years ago they started talking about how we were going to have

705
01:10:35,892 --> 01:10:42,118
[SPEAKER_22]: autonomous vehicles definitely by this time and we're all going to have parking lots around the edge of the city.

706
01:10:42,558 --> 01:10:44,019
[SPEAKER_22]: That clearly hasn't happened yet.

707
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:51,366
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is something that has been a moving target for both cities and planners for a while now.

708
01:10:51,866 --> 01:10:52,967
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not going to change.

709
01:10:53,188 --> 01:10:55,770
[SPEAKER_22]: So making it flexible enough is important.

710
01:10:57,431 --> 01:10:59,532
[SPEAKER_22]: Very quick because we've got a line off.

711
01:11:00,033 --> 01:11:01,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

712
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:03,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Another thing is that the reductions can be some.

713
01:11:03,575 --> 01:11:09,639
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it's not that you choose 1 reduction or the other is that some of them can be subsequently applied.

714
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,463
[SPEAKER_16]: So, we go to somebody we have a couple hands online.

715
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:21,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so we're going to go to page online after I mute myself.

716
01:11:21,447 --> 01:11:22,988
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to hit unmute on you.

717
01:11:29,409 --> 01:11:30,630
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi there, Page Buldini.

718
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:32,172
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks for everybody being here.

719
01:11:32,192 --> 01:11:37,116
[SPEAKER_28]: 37 Winter Street and my business, Paige Aesthetics, is 319 Boston Ave.

720
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,639
[SPEAKER_28]: I support zoning reform, but want to make sure we get it right.

721
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:46,024
[SPEAKER_28]: Somerville took about seven years to finish theirs, which is way too long.

722
01:11:46,645 --> 01:11:51,169
[SPEAKER_28]: But how can we ensure Medford's process is thorough, fair, and includes everyone,

723
01:11:51,609 --> 01:11:54,011
[SPEAKER_28]: but doesn't seem rushed for important decisions.

724
01:11:54,772 --> 01:11:59,676
[SPEAKER_28]: About 70% of my clients come from outside of Medford and they drive here.

725
01:12:00,496 --> 01:12:06,621
[SPEAKER_28]: How can we protect parking for local businesses so they can keep serving customers who support our community?

726
01:12:07,582 --> 01:12:15,268
[SPEAKER_28]: Both of my parents were stroke survivors and accessible parking meant the difference between being able to participate in their community or not.

727
01:12:16,269 --> 01:12:20,633
[SPEAKER_28]: How will the new zoning plan ensure accessible parking for those of all abilities?

728
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:27,897
[SPEAKER_28]: Finally, how will the city keep everyone informed and involved so that no one is left out of these conversations?

729
01:12:28,698 --> 01:12:32,261
[SPEAKER_28]: This zoning reform affects every resident and business owner.

730
01:12:32,842 --> 01:12:33,643
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much.

731
01:12:43,286 --> 01:12:45,228
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

732
01:12:45,268 --> 01:12:56,294
[SPEAKER_22]: Paige, first of all, thank you for your comments on both accessibility for small businesses and accessibility for people who may not be able to walk long distances for whatever reason.

733
01:12:56,495 --> 01:13:09,463
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a whole host of why people have had illnesses, strokes, as you've said, people with young children, people who have broken their legs, a temporary thing.

734
01:13:11,023 --> 01:13:23,888
[SPEAKER_22]: But all of it important so I think, you know, as we look at parking as we've discussed it internally there's basically a couple of different levels, Paula mentioned that it was complex earlier and she's absolutely right.

735
01:13:24,548 --> 01:13:27,169
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of this, we can do through zoning.

736
01:13:28,509 --> 01:13:29,830
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of the requirements.

737
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:43,281
[SPEAKER_22]: some of this is a city level right it's what are the city's policies for public parking whether it's on street or a parking garage and then that is not being dealt with by zoning.

738
01:13:43,782 --> 01:13:53,690
[SPEAKER_22]: Paola also mentioned curb management earlier and some of that has been maybe those are spaces for people who need to be able to have direct access

739
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:56,873
[SPEAKER_22]: somebody who is wheelchair bound or whatever.

740
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,755
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for your comments.

741
01:13:58,816 --> 01:14:03,661
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we will take those into account as we go forward.

742
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:04,963
[SPEAKER_22]: They're very important.

743
01:14:05,223 --> 01:14:09,448
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to turn it over, Alicia, for how the communication is being done from the city level.

744
01:14:09,929 --> 01:14:11,130
[SPEAKER_22]: So the different strategies.

745
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:11,731
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, Alicia.

746
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:15,022
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I could tell you, but it's a little bit more for you.

747
01:14:15,682 --> 01:14:18,964
[SPEAKER_16]: You're turning it over to me because I'm on the Traffic Commission.

748
01:14:19,024 --> 01:14:35,332
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the things that I was going to mention is that there is an option, and people actually request this every month, that if you have a reason to have a handicapped parking spot near your home, you can actually request that.

749
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:47,779
[SPEAKER_16]: And the traffic commission will take into account, are there other handicapped spots on your street, we will assure you that this will not be a private parking spot that this is for anybody who has a valid handicap placard.

750
01:14:48,139 --> 01:14:54,383
[SPEAKER_16]: And in fact you must have the valid handicap placard in order to use it, but that the city has been.

751
01:14:54,903 --> 01:14:57,726
[SPEAKER_16]: adding handicapped parking spots all over the community.

752
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:03,932
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you see those, the reason they're there is because somebody has specifically requested it for that location.

753
01:15:04,613 --> 01:15:13,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes when that person moves, the neighbors may say, you know what, we'd really like this spot returned to the rest of us now because there's no longer a need on this block.

754
01:15:14,203 --> 01:15:17,406
[SPEAKER_16]: And with that, when we're alerted to that, then the

755
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:23,229
[SPEAKER_16]: actually the police and the city manages the traffic commission through our police department.

756
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:31,754
[SPEAKER_16]: So one of the traffic officers will confirm that it's no longer, there's no longer a valid reason to have it at that location, that that resident is no longer there.

757
01:15:32,834 --> 01:15:35,356
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we'll vote to remove that sign.

758
01:15:35,576 --> 01:15:37,477
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want people to know that that's an option.

759
01:15:38,612 --> 01:15:54,541
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been working on trying to do communications through a number of different ways through social media, which is really one of our easier ways to get out to people some people the mayor has been doing robo calls, if anybody doesn't know what I mean by that.

760
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:59,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Then you may not be signed up for the city's emergency alert system.

761
01:16:00,067 --> 01:16:07,371
[SPEAKER_16]: So the mayor does do remote calls, or you can get it via text or email on average weekly.

762
01:16:07,631 --> 01:16:11,633
[SPEAKER_16]: And she has been starting to do some specifically about the zoning as well.

763
01:16:12,473 --> 01:16:16,115
[SPEAKER_16]: If you aren't signed up for those, I strongly recommend them because.

764
01:16:16,495 --> 01:16:20,958
[SPEAKER_16]: If we ever had an emergency, like a boil water emergency, that's what we would use to reach you.

765
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:23,179
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's that.

766
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:27,562
[SPEAKER_16]: We try to get it out to the public through other media.

767
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:30,484
[SPEAKER_16]: We've technically done press releases and sent it to the press.

768
01:16:31,084 --> 01:16:36,288
[SPEAKER_16]: A shout out to God & No Medford, who is an up-and-coming press outlet here in the city.

769
01:16:36,668 --> 01:16:38,209
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, it is online only.

770
01:16:38,769 --> 01:16:44,293
[SPEAKER_16]: But they have actually sent reporters to some of our events, and they often will have a reporter on these calls as well.

771
01:16:45,193 --> 01:16:47,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so there is some attempts.

772
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:53,016
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really hard to get the word out, especially because these things are happening somewhat quickly.

773
01:16:53,456 --> 01:16:58,558
[SPEAKER_16]: So next I'll just do a quick add again next week on the 18th.

774
01:16:58,818 --> 01:17:01,099
[SPEAKER_16]: The community development board is taking up.

775
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:03,101
[SPEAKER_16]: the residential zoning again.

776
01:17:04,302 --> 01:17:10,208
[SPEAKER_16]: We couldn't do advanced noticing about that because they only voted last week to take it up on the 18th.

777
01:17:10,328 --> 01:17:12,551
[SPEAKER_16]: So we tend to only have about two weeks notice.

778
01:17:13,091 --> 01:17:18,677
[SPEAKER_16]: And then on the 25th of June, they will be taking up the Medford squares as well.

779
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:22,980
[SPEAKER_16]: In the community development board, I think I hit that.

780
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:27,783
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to keep us moving because it is 755 if I can just communications piece.

781
01:17:27,863 --> 01:17:33,727
[SPEAKER_26]: If there's anybody in the world who hasn't already heard me plug Medford dot org slash zoning.

782
01:17:34,207 --> 01:17:39,290
[SPEAKER_26]: We collaboratively work very hard to make sure that all upcoming voting meetings are at the top of that page.

783
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,571
[SPEAKER_26]: So, if you're interested in this topic.

784
01:17:41,111 --> 01:17:50,014
[SPEAKER_26]: Please bookmark it and please help us get the word out, which we are doing through every mechanism available to us to make sure that your neighbors know about these meetings as well.

785
01:17:50,474 --> 01:17:59,977
[SPEAKER_16]: We have found that the most effective way to get the word out is for people to tell their neighbors because they see it on Facebook or they see it somewhere and they just in one ear out the other.

786
01:17:59,997 --> 01:18:03,598
[SPEAKER_16]: And when their neighbor talks to them, then they start paying attention.

787
01:18:03,967 --> 01:18:09,852
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're actually asking people to tell their neighbors about it because that is in fact the best way to get the word out.

788
01:18:10,172 --> 01:18:11,673
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have four hands online.

789
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:14,435
[SPEAKER_16]: So let me go to, are we back?

790
01:18:14,475 --> 01:18:15,316
[SPEAKER_16]: We just did online.

791
01:18:15,636 --> 01:18:17,858
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll do one in the room and then we'll go to one online.

792
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:20,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we have a lot of hands in the room too.

793
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:20,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

794
01:18:21,181 --> 01:18:26,745
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, Erica DeRoche, 260 Willis Ave.

795
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:31,529
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to start by saying thank you for bringing all the nuance of

796
01:18:32,063 --> 01:18:44,481
[SPEAKER_25]: TDM to this conversation and talking about the different, the short, medium, long term strategies, I think that's really helpful for those of us who aren't well versed in it.

797
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:46,884
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm particularly interested in

798
01:18:49,492 --> 01:18:53,895
[SPEAKER_25]: the strategies related to incentivizing reduction of parking.

799
01:18:56,277 --> 01:19:04,403
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm also wanted to pick up something that Alicia said earlier about that smaller scale development, or I would even say owners.

800
01:19:05,524 --> 01:19:17,033
[SPEAKER_25]: What are the incentives for small-scale developers and for owners of property, particularly property that has residential use on it?

801
01:19:17,643 --> 01:19:21,224
[SPEAKER_25]: to decrease the amount of parking on those lots?

802
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,084
[SPEAKER_25]: What are some of those strategies?

803
01:19:25,064 --> 01:19:42,808
[SPEAKER_25]: Because with smaller scale development, that ends up being a lot of curb cuts and a lot of energy and space and expense that we pay for as a city, but towards parking.

804
01:19:43,308 --> 01:19:43,648
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

805
01:19:44,756 --> 01:19:48,957
[SPEAKER_16]: So I will say, I'm going to say off the top that I'm not an expert on this.

806
01:19:49,917 --> 01:20:01,000
[SPEAKER_16]: But when you mentioned curb cuts, one of the things that I think would be helpful in a big picture way to get feedback from residents is in, it used to be 50 years ago common to do shared driveways.

807
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:02,440
[SPEAKER_16]: And then people don't like sharing.

808
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,941
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't like talking to their neighbors.

809
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,401
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't like doing that.

810
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:09,783
[SPEAKER_16]: But if it's a shared driveway to like parking in the back, how does this work?

811
01:20:09,803 --> 01:20:11,464
[SPEAKER_16]: You park on this side, I park on that side.

812
01:20:11,704 --> 01:20:17,726
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not actually currently allowed under current Medford zoning, but shared driveways means fewer curb cuts.

813
01:20:17,806 --> 01:20:20,668
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe it's not such a bad idea after all.

814
01:20:21,588 --> 01:20:25,210
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe being forced to talk to your neighbors isn't horrible.

815
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:30,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, my brain just went to several different places there.

816
01:20:33,249 --> 01:20:42,597
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing is that we did have some issues where we were having developers who were flipping houses, paving over the entire backyard.

817
01:20:43,197 --> 01:20:44,759
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is no longer allowed.

818
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:49,482
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we did actually put into our zoning parking maximums.

819
01:20:49,823 --> 01:20:52,825
[SPEAKER_16]: So like for a single family home, you're only allowed to have 200%.

820
01:20:52,945 --> 01:20:53,746
[SPEAKER_16]: So that means for two,

821
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:59,250
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't have more than four parking spots in your single family.

822
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:00,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, that doesn't count the driveway, right?

823
01:21:01,171 --> 01:21:03,673
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're not allowed to have front yard parking.

824
01:21:03,993 --> 01:21:06,735
[SPEAKER_16]: So your driveway doesn't count as spots.

825
01:21:07,096 --> 01:21:08,537
[SPEAKER_16]: The garage does.

826
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:14,701
[SPEAKER_16]: But then if you pave over your back yard, now how many parking spots did you just put back there?

827
01:21:14,801 --> 01:21:15,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Six, eight?

828
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:16,683
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not allowed anymore.

829
01:21:17,063 --> 01:21:19,805
[SPEAKER_16]: And our building department is actually starting to enforce that.

830
01:21:20,085 --> 01:21:23,167
[SPEAKER_16]: So you may say, well, somebody did that five years ago next door to me.

831
01:21:24,248 --> 01:21:29,314
[SPEAKER_16]: But in the last two years, they're enforcing this maximum that they're not allowing that.

832
01:21:29,994 --> 01:21:36,582
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're also not allowing people to pave over their whole front yard to make a whole parking lot in front.

833
01:21:37,342 --> 01:21:46,192
[SPEAKER_16]: As long as what's interesting, though, is that homeowners don't necessarily know that they have to have a permit and what's allowed or not allowed.

834
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:57,573
[SPEAKER_16]: So if your neighbor just decides one day to pave over their front yard, as some I know did, they may not know that they need a building permit or permission from the building department.

835
01:21:58,053 --> 01:22:03,860
[SPEAKER_16]: And the person who's paving their yard may not care about what's allowed or not allowed in Medford.

836
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,743
[SPEAKER_16]: So sometimes that happens before somebody

837
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,280
[SPEAKER_16]: tells them it's not allowed.

838
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,220
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a follow-up.

839
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:13,341
[SPEAKER_25]: I did have a follow-up question, but I actually forgot what it was.

840
01:22:14,341 --> 01:22:17,182
[SPEAKER_25]: But basically, it's easier.

841
01:22:17,202 --> 01:22:28,184
[SPEAKER_25]: I can see that it's, in a lot of ways, easier to provide those incentives to actual developers than to some of these smaller lots.

842
01:22:30,085 --> 01:22:30,965
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess, same question.

843
01:22:31,045 --> 01:22:34,706
[SPEAKER_16]: And I will say, when you talk about the 200 unit buildings,

844
01:22:35,665 --> 01:22:41,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Those developers are easy to work with, and we work with the ones who have good reputations in the city of Medford.

845
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:51,355
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's smaller developers that some are wonderful and some are not wonderful, and it's really hard to just sort of treat everybody equally.

846
01:22:51,635 --> 01:22:53,016
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a different situation.

847
01:22:54,126 --> 01:23:08,959
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and just to quickly add on that because I see a lot of hands in both places but as we have been doing studies for building heights and street widths and etc for the, for the neighborhoods that we've been looking at and the other zoning.

848
01:23:09,339 --> 01:23:15,064
[SPEAKER_22]: We have been talking about ways of showing how parking can fit onto sites with different

849
01:23:16,445 --> 01:23:30,501
[SPEAKER_22]: restrictions and requirements and levels of zoning so we would probably continue to do that and try and figure out how those incentives would work and I see you've just remembered your question so real quick it was just.

850
01:23:31,794 --> 01:23:33,135
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry, I can't remember.

851
01:23:33,255 --> 01:23:51,029
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm so I'm like, but you know what you're going to give me a great, very quick reminder for those of you who are in the room there are two boards in the back, one that says I have questions or comments or discussion about public parking, and one I have questions comments discussion about zoning.

852
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:56,151
[SPEAKER_22]: If on your way out, you think of anything or you have anything else, just park them back there.

853
01:23:56,491 --> 01:24:03,394
[SPEAKER_22]: We have four people online and it's online terms next.

854
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:05,855
[SPEAKER_22]: I see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7 here.

855
01:24:06,035 --> 01:24:08,256
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I just quickly flag?

856
01:24:08,957 --> 01:24:10,477
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, exactly.

857
01:24:10,497 --> 01:24:11,378
[SPEAKER_22]: We're getting kicked out at 8.45.

858
01:24:11,478 --> 01:24:12,598
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

859
01:24:12,618 --> 01:24:14,659
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's keep it to sync so that we can hear from everybody.

860
01:24:14,679 --> 01:24:15,600
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going to go to Zoom next.

861
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:21,757
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to go to Miranda Briseño on Zoom.

862
01:24:27,693 --> 01:24:31,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I live on Taylor Street, the hillside area.

863
01:24:33,118 --> 01:24:37,021
[SPEAKER_06]: 1st, I just want to plug that mascot actually has a lot of vehicle ownership data.

864
01:24:38,001 --> 01:24:42,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Available to municipalities that breaks it down by vehicle type.

865
01:24:43,566 --> 01:24:52,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Personal commercial also has a lot of data on through the cities and the average daily mileage.

866
01:24:54,474 --> 01:24:57,276
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, all of the cars that I think would be really helpful.

867
01:24:58,217 --> 01:25:00,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to echo a lot of what's been said that.

868
01:25:01,539 --> 01:25:07,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Induced demand exists and the reality is that the 38,000 cars that exist in Medford.

869
01:25:07,904 --> 01:25:11,567
[SPEAKER_06]: If we eliminated parking minimums tonight would still be here tomorrow.

870
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:12,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine included.

871
01:25:13,728 --> 01:25:15,810
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think removing those parking minimums.

872
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:36,301
[SPEAKER_06]: will still will support and encourage developers or smaller owners to not consider having parking, but it's still not going to change people who do need and want to build parking anyway, because again, there are almost 40,000 cars in this city.

873
01:25:37,821 --> 01:25:39,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I would have loved to not buy a car a year ago.

874
01:25:41,353 --> 01:25:45,114
[SPEAKER_06]: my insurance, my car payment monthly, you know, gas, everything.

875
01:25:45,154 --> 01:25:46,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I bought a hybrid, I was excited about that.

876
01:25:47,315 --> 01:25:50,556
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, like, I would have loved to not have that experience.

877
01:25:50,596 --> 01:25:53,997
[SPEAKER_06]: But it just, I sat on it for about two months before I finally made the decision.

878
01:25:54,017 --> 01:25:56,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have loved not to do it.

879
01:25:56,558 --> 01:25:57,558
[SPEAKER_06]: But here I am anyway.

880
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:07,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So even as a car owner, as someone who has spent a lot of time with people with mobility limitations, the parking that people need will be there.

881
01:26:09,158 --> 01:26:16,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can find ways to support those that don't need a car, don't want a car, can't afford a car, and are reliant on public transit.

882
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:17,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

883
01:26:23,407 --> 01:26:30,352
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm just going to say, Miranda, our staff will be reaching out to you for help in getting that data.

884
01:26:30,712 --> 01:26:34,034
[SPEAKER_16]: If it wasn't clear, we know Miranda and she works for MassDOT.

885
01:26:35,573 --> 01:26:36,974
[SPEAKER_26]: Great, I'm going to go to the 1st hand.

886
01:26:37,014 --> 01:26:39,936
[SPEAKER_26]: I saw we're going to try really hard to get everybody.

887
01:26:43,099 --> 01:26:51,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And I live in West Medford just to piggyback on the gentleman's comment about if you have more spots, you're going to get more cars.

888
01:26:52,046 --> 01:26:53,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that also the case?

889
01:26:53,267 --> 01:26:57,450
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have more units in a town, will you get more cars?

890
01:27:01,651 --> 01:27:03,973
[SPEAKER_22]: I can take an initial stab at that.

891
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:04,894
[SPEAKER_22]: Not necessarily.

892
01:27:06,315 --> 01:27:11,120
[SPEAKER_22]: So it very much, I think, depends on where your units is.

893
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,361
[SPEAKER_22]: That was great English.

894
01:27:12,702 --> 01:27:23,152
[SPEAKER_22]: Where your units are and also who they're pitched to for the units that are for, and this is where

895
01:27:23,933 --> 01:27:33,984
[SPEAKER_22]: The transit policy comes in it's why Medford already has a reduction in parking requirements for units that are near the higher transit areas right near the green line.

896
01:27:35,266 --> 01:27:44,876
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe so much, not so much the commuter line as we're hearing so that's one of the things that we're going to be looking at, but not just looking at in terms of Medford again, we've been doing a deep dive.

897
01:27:45,617 --> 01:27:51,162
[SPEAKER_22]: Paula has been doing a deep dive into strategies and recommendations and precedents from others.

898
01:27:51,282 --> 01:28:02,792
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's what we want to bring back is it's easy for me to say that it's not always the case, but what we want to do is find out places that it has worked or that it hasn't worked.

899
01:28:03,252 --> 01:28:09,358
[SPEAKER_22]: Back to my example of this community that did have good transit, but people still needed cars.

900
01:28:09,538 --> 01:28:11,039
[SPEAKER_22]: So we are looking into that.

901
01:28:11,059 --> 01:28:11,820
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a great question.

902
01:28:14,586 --> 01:28:17,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Back to Zoom.

903
01:28:17,107 --> 01:28:19,308
[SPEAKER_16]: The next person on Zoom is Steve Pompeo.

904
01:28:24,369 --> 01:28:24,729
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi, thanks.

905
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:26,710
[SPEAKER_33]: I just have a couple of quick questions.

906
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:30,211
[SPEAKER_33]: One regarding alternative parking facilities.

907
01:28:31,011 --> 01:28:41,815
[SPEAKER_33]: How does the zoning plan allow for alternative parking facilities in mixed-use zones, and in particular, the rebuild of the Governor's Ave Garage?

908
01:28:41,855 --> 01:28:42,835
[SPEAKER_33]: The other question is,

909
01:28:43,692 --> 01:29:05,745
[SPEAKER_33]: can you please discontinue the practice where the city council and the community development board are posting their hearing notices simultaneously and where the city council is posting their notice prior to even receiving their recommendations back from the community development board?

910
01:29:06,326 --> 01:29:13,410
[SPEAKER_33]: I think that's one thing that's causing a lot of confusion because the city council is posting their public hearing

911
01:29:14,245 --> 01:29:23,710
[SPEAKER_33]: And then the Community Development Board continues theirs, which means the City Council has to continue theirs, but none of those continuations get the same type of posting as the original meeting.

912
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:27,312
[SPEAKER_33]: And so it gets confusing as to which meeting people need to attend.

913
01:29:27,332 --> 01:29:30,734
[SPEAKER_33]: And it just seems to be rushing, rushing the whole process.

914
01:29:30,754 --> 01:29:39,218
[SPEAKER_33]: So if the City Council could just wait until they got their recommendations back from the Community Development Board to post their public hearings, I think that would help a lot.

915
01:29:39,919 --> 01:29:40,159
[SPEAKER_33]: Thanks.

916
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:50,919
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, sorry.

917
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,441
[SPEAKER_22]: Now I will speak to the alternative parking arrangements.

918
01:29:55,501 --> 01:30:06,485
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, we don't have a specific recommendation for Medford yet, but the way I've seen it done in other communities is that you have the ability to count parking that is within a certain distance of your lot.

919
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:16,468
[SPEAKER_22]: In some cases, it might be you, the property owner, have another lot and you're putting the parking on lot, that's the off-site parking that Paolo's mentioned earlier.

920
01:30:17,028 --> 01:30:30,876
[SPEAKER_22]: Another alternative parking arrangement, I think this is maybe where the speaker was getting to, is that there is a city garage that has a certain number of parking spaces available and you are allowed to lease those parking spaces from the city to put towards a development.

921
01:30:31,177 --> 01:30:33,618
[SPEAKER_22]: So those are just two general options.

922
01:30:33,638 --> 01:30:37,560
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to turn it over to... You want one very quickly?

923
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:38,301
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, yeah, yeah.

924
01:30:39,021 --> 01:30:39,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Quickly.

925
01:30:41,563 --> 01:30:48,269
[SPEAKER_13]: When it's being rented or leased, that has to be a minimum of years.

926
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:59,178
[SPEAKER_13]: In order to do the reduction, you need at least, what I have seen, it's at least 10 years, so just long times of service.

927
01:31:00,139 --> 01:31:01,840
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's an important point, Paola.

928
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,340
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

929
01:31:03,201 --> 01:31:05,383
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you want to talk to the garage and

930
01:31:06,992 --> 01:31:10,414
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think that we can talk about a specific project at this time.

931
01:31:10,454 --> 01:31:11,454
[SPEAKER_16]: This is about zoning.

932
01:31:12,055 --> 01:31:15,757
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'll just say that we had been advertising the two meetings together.

933
01:31:15,777 --> 01:31:23,240
[SPEAKER_16]: In most situations, it was to reduce confusion, to make it clear that two different boards were meeting on the same topic.

934
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:31,344
[SPEAKER_16]: But with this continuing of the Community Development Board, I do acknowledge that that is causing more confusion.

935
01:31:31,948 --> 01:31:37,833
[SPEAKER_16]: In the way this is working out previously in other situations, it was really to reduce the confusion.

936
01:31:37,853 --> 01:31:39,895
[SPEAKER_16]: So should we get to the next question?

937
01:31:39,915 --> 01:31:43,778
[SPEAKER_16]: And it saves a lot of money in advertising.

938
01:31:50,298 --> 01:32:00,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say, I think it's frankly unconscionable during a housing shortage and climate emergency that we are mandating any space in our city be set aside for car storage.

939
01:32:00,728 --> 01:32:02,590
[SPEAKER_02]: If people need it, they can figure that out.

940
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:04,792
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need the government telling us.

941
01:32:05,332 --> 01:32:12,919
[SPEAKER_02]: The parking mandates are implicitly a subsidy to cars, the community that claims to care about walkability, about traffic jams, about traffic noise, about the climate crisis.

942
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:22,686
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who adore a drooling, drooling commute through our city would be right to think of every mandatory but underutilized parking space in Medford as a slap in their face.

943
01:32:23,346 --> 01:32:32,472
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be almost cruel to point out to them that our government mandated parking might be repurposed about urban housing that might relieve them of their Sisyphean commute.

944
01:32:32,912 --> 01:32:39,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, it's insulting to me as a non-rival of a city policy that apparently thinks of me as temporarily embarrassed traffic.

945
01:32:41,238 --> 01:32:56,625
[SPEAKER_02]: We're privileged to call Medford home, and I'm skipping most of this page, but I'm gonna say throughout this process, people have stood up and our city council has done a good job adopting a zoning code that's pro-housing, but it's just going to be pretty maps if we don't repeal or significantly reduce the parking mandates.

946
01:32:56,845 --> 01:33:03,628
[SPEAKER_02]: We say we're for more housing, we have the maps that say we like lots of units, but it's not going to get built unless you repeal the parking minimums.

947
01:33:05,345 --> 01:33:09,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's very difficult when planners are asked, what should the parking minimum be?

948
01:33:10,006 --> 01:33:20,848
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say there shouldn't be parking minimums because you get fired because you're supposed to look up in the ITE trip generation manual and find what it says and look at the ridiculous chart.

949
01:33:23,028 --> 01:33:26,149
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't mean parking minimums are a good idea.

950
01:33:26,749 --> 01:33:30,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't mean that that's the best way forward.

951
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping

952
01:33:34,279 --> 01:33:42,542
[SPEAKER_02]: that by the end of this calendar year, we see our city council take a vote on whether or not they're going to eliminate parking minimums.

953
01:33:42,922 --> 01:33:49,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that the planners are not ready to recommend that at this time, but to me, that's a political decision.

954
01:33:50,564 --> 01:33:53,205
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a political decision when it comes

955
01:33:54,577 --> 01:33:58,318
[SPEAKER_02]: to seeing that we center cars at every stage of the development process.

956
01:33:58,358 --> 01:34:01,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time we see what might get built, we start with the parking minimum.

957
01:34:01,859 --> 01:34:02,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we fit the parking?

958
01:34:02,879 --> 01:34:05,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, once we fit the parking, maybe then we can see how much apartments there are.

959
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:08,720
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not right.

960
01:34:09,761 --> 01:34:11,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not consistent with our values.

961
01:34:12,401 --> 01:34:16,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be able to recycle most of the speech next time because I get most of it.

962
01:34:17,423 --> 01:34:19,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you for hearing that.

963
01:34:27,064 --> 01:34:30,969
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure that we need to respond, but thank you for your, your comments.

964
01:34:31,109 --> 01:34:32,251
[SPEAKER_16]: There were no questions.

965
01:34:32,271 --> 01:34:33,692
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been trying to respond to questions.

966
01:34:33,712 --> 01:34:34,894
[SPEAKER_16]: We're no questions in that.

967
01:34:35,615 --> 01:34:37,737
[SPEAKER_16]: So should we go to one online and what?

968
01:34:37,878 --> 01:34:38,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, sorry.

969
01:34:38,418 --> 01:34:39,700
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't lower this hand.

970
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:41,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Steve is the one who just spoke.

971
01:34:42,323 --> 01:34:45,868
[SPEAKER_16]: So the next one online is Megan Mars.

972
01:34:51,007 --> 01:34:51,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi there.

973
01:34:51,707 --> 01:34:55,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Megan Mars at 71 Clark Street.

974
01:34:55,829 --> 01:35:02,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just speaking now to show support for reducing parking mandates, not really just as a zoning issue, but really as a community issue.

975
01:35:02,791 --> 01:35:06,733
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my biggest concern and issue with parking mandates.

976
01:35:07,293 --> 01:35:13,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when we require every new building to include a certain number of parking spaces, we're really prioritizing cars over people.

977
01:35:14,535 --> 01:35:18,617
[SPEAKER_03]: But walkable, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods are what truly foster connection.

978
01:35:19,237 --> 01:35:20,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where people want to live.

979
01:35:20,598 --> 01:35:26,600
[SPEAKER_03]: People want to live in walkable communities that are alive and not just a sea of asphalt and cars.

980
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:30,682
[SPEAKER_03]: The more we design our spaces for cars, the more isolated we become.

981
01:35:31,222 --> 01:35:36,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It means longer drives, wider roads that are really stressful and quite frightening to cross.

982
01:35:36,924 --> 01:35:45,754
[SPEAKER_03]: and vast parking lots that separate us from chance encounters, sidewalk chats, and daily rituals that make a community actually feel alive.

983
01:35:46,415 --> 01:35:53,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I know parking and cars are going to be inescapable for some people, but I don't feel like lowering parking mandates makes it impossible to have a car.

984
01:35:54,023 --> 01:35:57,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little more challenging, sure, but by no means impossible.

985
01:35:57,608 --> 01:36:04,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lived in Somerville and Cambridge, areas where parking a car is certainly more challenging, but it's really always been doable if you need a car.

986
01:36:05,017 --> 01:36:11,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in South Medford now, and yeah, sometimes you have to park a block or two away, but in my opinion, that's a really small price to pay.

987
01:36:12,487 --> 01:36:16,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And the benefits we get from limiting car dependency really outweigh the drawbacks, in my opinion.

988
01:36:16,429 --> 01:36:19,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we need accessible options for people who need them.

989
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:21,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really completely sympathetic to that.

990
01:36:21,852 --> 01:36:28,515
[SPEAKER_03]: But there will also always be many other individuals who will be perfectly fine walking a couple of blocks from where they park to their home.

991
01:36:29,475 --> 01:36:41,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And reducing parking mandates will boost use of public transportation, which in turn provides more funding and support for public transport, which allows it to expand, become more frequent, and make it an even easier and more convenient option.

992
01:36:41,759 --> 01:36:49,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a car myself, but I really feel like the havoc that car-based infrastructure has inflicted on our communities really cannot be overstated.

993
01:36:50,264 --> 01:37:04,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know some of us have really grown used to this system, and it can be hard to imagine a brighter future, but we can create something so much better and so much more alive where our cities are no longer forced to sacrifice community for car-based infrastructure.

994
01:37:04,691 --> 01:37:05,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

995
01:37:05,151 --> 01:37:06,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need a response.

996
01:37:21,488 --> 01:37:23,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I just needed the high five from.

997
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:26,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Sneha Khan.

998
01:37:26,533 --> 01:37:31,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for the presentation and for this opportunity to speak.

999
01:37:31,838 --> 01:37:37,723
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that parking minimums affect modern people who are car owners or people who drive.

1000
01:37:38,488 --> 01:37:51,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And in we've had so many meetings so far and during this process and people have resoundingly come forward and said that they want more density and it's it's not possible to have more density if you have the same, or just slightly reduced.

1001
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:54,731
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, parking minimums.

1002
01:37:54,811 --> 01:38:05,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So in that situation, how does your, how do your recommendations tie in or make possible the earlier recommendations of how the conversation has moved so far?

1003
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,203
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other question that I have is that, uh,

1004
01:38:12,003 --> 01:38:26,377
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a lot of people who have spoken up so far, and I'm sure there will be more others later on voicing the opinion that they actually would prefer, myself included, would prefer to eliminate parking minimums, whether it be at certain neighbourhoods or citywide.

1005
01:38:27,298 --> 01:38:35,767
[SPEAKER_10]: So in that case, going back to your premise of how you started out, that you don't have a plan that you're proposing and you're open to suggestions, would you be willing to

1006
01:38:36,447 --> 01:38:46,515
[SPEAKER_10]: revise the view that you don't want to eliminate parking minimums, considering that there's a significant few of us, lot of us who want to do that.

1007
01:38:46,615 --> 01:38:48,376
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are my two questions.

1008
01:38:56,802 --> 01:38:57,083
[SPEAKER_22]: So

1009
01:38:59,089 --> 01:39:02,490
[SPEAKER_22]: Part of this was to hear the differences of opinion.

1010
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:04,730
[SPEAKER_22]: We knew there would be differences of opinion, right?

1011
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:07,291
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why we have public meetings is so we could hear them all.

1012
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:12,632
[SPEAKER_22]: Our next step is to make that first presentation to the planning and permitting committee.

1013
01:39:13,512 --> 01:39:25,414
[SPEAKER_22]: For those of you who may have been following what we've done with the other components of the zoning we've talked about is that in that meeting, we bring forward what we've heard, what we recommend based on what we've heard.

1014
01:39:25,434 --> 01:39:27,855
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a conversation with planning and permitting

1015
01:39:28,575 --> 01:39:30,697
[SPEAKER_22]: We go away and sometimes we're doing more research.

1016
01:39:30,757 --> 01:39:33,279
[SPEAKER_22]: Sometimes we're coming back with an alternative recommendation.

1017
01:39:33,579 --> 01:39:41,826
[SPEAKER_22]: Sometimes they're telling us, this is what we want you to do, which of course, as city councilors is absolutely well within what they should be doing.

1018
01:39:43,528 --> 01:39:45,669
[SPEAKER_22]: As I said, we don't have any recommendations today.

1019
01:39:45,710 --> 01:39:49,873
[SPEAKER_22]: We probably will not have any recommendations on Wednesday because that's only two days away.

1020
01:39:50,413 --> 01:39:55,578
[SPEAKER_22]: But we are certainly trying to gather as much evidence as we can and much opinion as we can.

1021
01:39:56,900 --> 01:40:06,455
[SPEAKER_22]: to prevent, to be able to present a balanced range of what we've heard to the planning and permitting committee for our discussions with them.

1022
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:08,538
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for that, that's very helpful to know.

1023
01:40:11,971 --> 01:40:24,623
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, on the side of the eliminating the parking minimums, there is 1 issue that usually people do not see and is that cars are parking our private property.

1024
01:40:25,164 --> 01:40:29,228
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we eliminate and we put the pressure on on the street parking.

1025
01:40:29,628 --> 01:40:33,392
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a lot of public space that is given to private property.

1026
01:40:33,892 --> 01:40:41,618
[SPEAKER_13]: So deleting parking minimums have some issues that we also need to take into account.

1027
01:40:42,598 --> 01:40:47,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Because what we are right now, it's in a reality where we have a lot of car dependency.

1028
01:40:48,843 --> 01:40:56,108
[SPEAKER_13]: And that can be really moved in the future when we have alternative measures that we make sure that that doesn't happen.

1029
01:40:57,209 --> 01:40:58,289
[SPEAKER_13]: That is one explanation.

1030
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:06,175
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll also add for those of you because clearly there's some people in the room who and both here and online are very interested in parking.

1031
01:41:06,996 --> 01:41:12,300
[SPEAKER_22]: If you haven't read the high cost of free parking, that would be a good one to look at.

1032
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:21,067
[SPEAKER_22]: As we present additional information to the planning and permitting committee, we are providing all of the resources that Paola mentioned earlier.

1033
01:41:21,087 --> 01:41:24,269
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be great for some deep dives for people as well.

1034
01:41:24,289 --> 01:41:26,391
[SPEAKER_22]: Three more online?

1035
01:41:26,411 --> 01:41:28,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and there's some more in the room.

1036
01:41:29,718 --> 01:41:30,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we back?

1037
01:41:30,879 --> 01:41:32,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I'm not tracking.

1038
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we on Zoom?

1039
01:41:35,062 --> 01:41:35,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1040
01:41:36,083 --> 01:41:36,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1041
01:41:36,523 --> 01:41:37,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I'm not tracking.

1042
01:41:38,305 --> 01:41:40,286
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to go to Ken Garrow online.

1043
01:41:40,306 --> 01:41:46,611
[SPEAKER_34]: All right.

1044
01:41:46,671 --> 01:41:46,991
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1045
01:41:47,031 --> 01:41:47,812
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm assuming you can hear me.

1046
01:41:50,593 --> 01:41:50,973
[SPEAKER_34]: Hopefully.

1047
01:41:52,835 --> 01:41:55,437
[SPEAKER_34]: So Ken Yarrow, I'm over in Lambert Street.

1048
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:02,722
[SPEAKER_34]: I've spent the last couple of days actually kind of looking up parking minimums just to kind of educate myself more.

1049
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:05,804
[SPEAKER_34]: Read an article on strong towns.

1050
01:42:05,944 --> 01:42:13,610
[SPEAKER_34]: There was a recent January Department of Transportation report that dropped about talking about parking reforms.

1051
01:42:16,403 --> 01:42:24,653
[SPEAKER_34]: One of the things is, I mean, first of all in general I'm kind of okay with at least minimizing parking minimums.

1052
01:42:26,676 --> 01:42:29,980
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't think they need to be quite as high as they currently are in our current zoning.

1053
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:44,698
[SPEAKER_34]: One of the things I noticed in a lot of the case studies that kept popping up were cities and municipalities that had a little more granular control over their public transit.

1054
01:42:45,498 --> 01:42:47,439
[SPEAKER_34]: So like Chicago, New York, Seattle.

1055
01:42:49,581 --> 01:42:51,102
[SPEAKER_34]: Obviously, Medford does not have that.

1056
01:42:51,162 --> 01:42:54,584
[SPEAKER_34]: And that's one of my concerns is that we definitely have some disproportionate

1057
01:42:57,693 --> 01:42:59,414
[SPEAKER_34]: service imbalances.

1058
01:43:00,134 --> 01:43:02,114
[SPEAKER_34]: Right now I'm over in Glenwood.

1059
01:43:02,414 --> 01:43:07,236
[SPEAKER_34]: I am stoked for when the 96 and 101 bus gets redesigned.

1060
01:43:07,256 --> 01:43:13,778
[SPEAKER_34]: But right now I have a 101 bus that shows up once an hour, give or take.

1061
01:43:14,878 --> 01:43:20,700
[SPEAKER_34]: And so I just want to throw that out because I've said it before.

1062
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:28,652
[SPEAKER_34]: But the other thing and Emily you, you made this comment, which I've heard about the book I just haven't gotten around to reading it.

1063
01:43:29,533 --> 01:43:37,356
[SPEAKER_34]: One of the big points that I think when you compare us to Somerville and Cambridge is able to parking permits right for your residential zones, especially areas.

1064
01:43:38,156 --> 01:43:40,338
[SPEAKER_34]: that are denser.

1065
01:43:40,538 --> 01:43:47,224
[SPEAKER_34]: And so like in my case, I have neighbors who have parking off street that I know park on street.

1066
01:43:48,745 --> 01:43:57,092
[SPEAKER_34]: And to that point of the high cost of parking, obviously, the parking department is not part of the zoning discussion.

1067
01:43:58,213 --> 01:44:06,480
[SPEAKER_34]: But I'm kind of hoping that there's something in that because part of the easy accessible transit manipulation

1068
01:44:07,988 --> 01:44:21,959
[SPEAKER_34]: And the lower frequency of kind of easy parking that can get offloaded by developers who do build in the absence of parking minimums kind of needs to be looked at.

1069
01:44:21,979 --> 01:44:33,307
[SPEAKER_34]: And so I'm kind of hoping the city is taking that in addition to the idea of kind of what is available for transport and kind of folding that in.

1070
01:44:35,042 --> 01:44:46,425
[SPEAKER_34]: Because right now I think we could delete parking minimums if we're talking about within that half mile radius among West Medford, Wellington, Tufts, Magoon Square.

1071
01:44:48,086 --> 01:44:58,369
[SPEAKER_34]: But yeah, that's kind of the biggest gist that makes me a little concerned that we don't offload and definitely let developers kind of run

1072
01:44:59,338 --> 01:45:05,344
[SPEAKER_34]: run over us just because we don't have kind of parking permit type structures in play like other surrounding areas do.

1073
01:45:12,971 --> 01:45:13,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you, Ken.

1074
01:45:13,992 --> 01:45:16,394
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll go to one in the room.

1075
01:45:16,775 --> 01:45:20,218
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to hear from the people more than I want to hear from the staff.

1076
01:45:23,302 --> 01:45:25,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Bill Douglas.

1077
01:45:26,264 --> 01:45:31,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess some of the points that I was going to bring up have been hit recently, but I wanted to kind of reiterate them anyway.

1078
01:45:32,087 --> 01:45:37,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to agree with everything Paul said earlier, for one, so you can dig into the record for that.

1079
01:45:37,751 --> 01:45:38,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't repeat it all.

1080
01:45:39,992 --> 01:45:43,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Fundamentally, I think eliminating the parking minimum is a disaster.

1081
01:45:43,975 --> 01:45:46,616
[SPEAKER_04]: You turn us into Back Bay or the worst parts of Cambridge.

1082
01:45:50,552 --> 01:45:52,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got my opinion, you've got yours.

1083
01:45:53,754 --> 01:46:05,802
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically what you're doing, basically what you're doing is what you just said, which is you're basically handing public property to the developers, because that's where the cars are gonna go.

1084
01:46:06,743 --> 01:46:15,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're also talking about today, this is a 30 year plan, and everything I see indicates that we're intending to build more units.

1085
01:46:16,569 --> 01:46:17,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot,

1086
01:46:18,355 --> 01:46:21,478
[SPEAKER_04]: fathom that we will not have more vehicles as a result of that.

1087
01:46:22,018 --> 01:46:26,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're gonna have more and more cars jamming up the streets.

1088
01:46:27,183 --> 01:46:34,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, it makes more sense to kind of maintain some level of integrity with respect to off-street parking.

1089
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:40,233
[SPEAKER_04]: We already have parts of the city that are more crowded on the street.

1090
01:46:40,814 --> 01:46:44,197
[SPEAKER_04]: This notion of, well, I don't mind walking a block or two.

1091
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:51,656
[SPEAKER_04]: There aren't that many elderly people here, but for a lot of people in the city, that's a big deal.

1092
01:46:52,658 --> 01:47:00,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And people talking about other alternative transportation, not all parts of the city have.

1093
01:47:01,695 --> 01:47:04,817
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people took public transportation all the way here tonight?

1094
01:47:04,937 --> 01:47:06,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too many, I would guess.

1095
01:47:08,259 --> 01:47:10,921
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

1096
01:47:11,061 --> 01:47:17,285
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I just think that eliminating parking minimums is going to turn out really bad.

1097
01:47:19,846 --> 01:47:20,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1098
01:47:21,227 --> 01:47:26,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Should we go to Andrew McRobert online?

1099
01:47:29,828 --> 01:47:36,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there, I just wanted to provide a couple anecdotal data points.

1100
01:47:38,664 --> 01:47:54,339
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 is that the, uh, in Wellington, the big strip of large scale retail with the massive parking lot, I'm talking about the area with, um, you know, ocean state job lot and Harbor Freight tools on 1 end stop and shop all the way down to Dave's hot chicken.

1101
01:47:54,759 --> 01:48:00,404
[SPEAKER_00]: That parking lot is never full and it's rarely even close to full.

1102
01:48:00,464 --> 01:48:01,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pass by it a lot.

1103
01:48:02,666 --> 01:48:09,151
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assume that there's so much parking as a result of parking minimums in that area.

1104
01:48:09,231 --> 01:48:14,474
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, one data point, I think that that should definitely be reduced.

1105
01:48:14,514 --> 01:48:16,816
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely way too much parking there.

1106
01:48:17,456 --> 01:48:20,578
[SPEAKER_00]: So much that they even put a Raising Cane's in recently.

1107
01:48:20,778 --> 01:48:28,424
[SPEAKER_00]: They took away a big swath of the parking lot, put in a new business, and there's still too much parking.

1108
01:48:30,927 --> 01:48:40,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, another another point I wanted to make about that is that these parking minimums push buildings further apart because they require.

1109
01:48:41,078 --> 01:48:52,249
[SPEAKER_00]: More parking service parking and so when you have buildings pushed further apart, the distance to everything is further and it makes things less walkable and.

1110
01:48:52,970 --> 01:49:17,285
[SPEAKER_00]: reinforces car dependence and that's especially noteworthy right there because it's next to wellington station it's next to public transit and there's so much underdeveloped just surface parking that that should be you know used well for you know in some sort of transit oriented development

1111
01:49:18,649 --> 01:49:28,354
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I wanted to mention, I'm not sure I have a point with this, but we're talking about induced demand.

1112
01:49:28,374 --> 01:49:34,458
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm a good example of this, or evaporated traffic demand.

1113
01:49:35,518 --> 01:49:41,522
[SPEAKER_00]: In Medford Square, that's about a mile and a half from me, and

1114
01:49:42,421 --> 01:50:07,421
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll walk if I have some time, I'm very comfortable biking during the day, but I'll drive if I want to go into Medford Square at night most of the time, because the street, how I get there, which is generally Riverside, or Salem Street, or a combination, is very, well, unfriendly if you're not in a motor vehicle, and so I just don't feel comfortable

1115
01:50:08,619 --> 01:50:12,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into its method on bike after darker when it's getting darker out.

1116
01:50:13,184 --> 01:50:24,436
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it, for example, uh, last month, I, I went to visit some friends we met up at Alta Cuba, and there happened to be a show at the Chevalier going on that night and.

1117
01:50:25,262 --> 01:50:33,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so everything was like, very, very full of cars and I'm, I'm just cruising through Medford square for like 10, 15 minutes.

1118
01:50:33,166 --> 01:50:42,790
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I eventually saw another car adding to traffic because there is not a safe walkable or bike option.

1119
01:50:45,411 --> 01:50:47,132
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's, uh, that's all I wanted to share.

1120
01:50:47,172 --> 01:50:47,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1121
01:50:52,598 --> 01:50:53,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you.

1122
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:55,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Very it's it's very helpful.

1123
01:50:55,620 --> 01:51:00,864
[SPEAKER_16]: And honestly, that's why I didn't bike tonight was because I was going to have to bike home after after dark.

1124
01:51:00,924 --> 01:51:03,606
[SPEAKER_16]: So we hear you and clipper ship connector.

1125
01:51:03,687 --> 01:51:05,368
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully we'll make some of that route.

1126
01:51:05,608 --> 01:51:08,670
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll make it a lot longer, but it would make it a lot more pleasant.

1127
01:51:09,311 --> 01:51:10,612
[SPEAKER_16]: It will be opening in July kit.

1128
01:51:16,257 --> 01:51:18,478
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, my name is Donna Monica.

1129
01:51:18,558 --> 01:51:21,760
[SPEAKER_21]: I live in West Medford and I want to highlight.

1130
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:27,022
[SPEAKER_21]: I was grateful to the gentleman I think from Douglas Road who brought up about elderly in the city.

1131
01:51:27,343 --> 01:51:31,185
[SPEAKER_21]: My mother has lived in the city for over 80 years and has been a homeowner for more than 60.

1132
01:51:31,305 --> 01:51:36,807
[SPEAKER_21]: She lives close to West Medford train station in a neighborhood of two family homes.

1133
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:45,492
[SPEAKER_21]: All of those streets between West Medford Square and going out along Placeton Road are two family homes and they are jam-packed with cars every day.

1134
01:51:46,773 --> 01:52:03,247
[SPEAKER_21]: As my mother tries to get to appointments and she uses the door-to-door that the city provides, a great service, or maybe an Uber, the difficulty in getting out into their car, down the curb, out into the street to get into those vehicles is significant.

1135
01:52:03,327 --> 01:52:05,889
[SPEAKER_21]: I worry about, you know, removal of

1136
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:16,774
[SPEAKER_21]: of allowing unrestricted parking to make that a more treacherous journey for elderly residents and for children in the neighborhoods.

1137
01:52:17,295 --> 01:52:26,038
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know we've talked about comparisons to Cambridge and Somerville, but even just a quick look at census data today, those are younger cities.

1138
01:52:26,519 --> 01:52:30,741
[SPEAKER_21]: In Medford, I believe it's more than 16% of residents are 65 or older.

1139
01:52:31,221 --> 01:52:33,402
[SPEAKER_21]: In Cambridge and Somerville, those numbers are closer to 10%.

1140
01:52:36,563 --> 01:53:04,671
[SPEAKER_21]: I wonder about the feasibility of doing an actual count in Medford, even if it's just for a point in time peek at how residents in the city, given the unique demographic makeup and transit makeup of the city, might inform our thinking about safe parking that's accessible for all and allows people to move safely about the neighborhoods.

1141
01:53:05,151 --> 01:53:05,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1142
01:53:06,366 --> 01:53:07,707
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much for your comments.

1143
01:53:07,767 --> 01:53:18,835
[SPEAKER_22]: We were just remembering, if you saw us whispering, it's because we just were remembering that we did some maps roughly this time last year that looked at age by census within Medford.

1144
01:53:18,915 --> 01:53:21,416
[SPEAKER_22]: And yours is a good reminder that we should look back at that.

1145
01:53:21,436 --> 01:53:23,218
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanted to explain why we were whispering.

1146
01:53:23,258 --> 01:53:24,418
[SPEAKER_22]: It was in reaction to that.

1147
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:25,980
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for your comments.

1148
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:27,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1149
01:53:27,721 --> 01:53:29,062
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to go to one online.

1150
01:53:30,223 --> 01:53:32,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Diane, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1151
01:53:37,149 --> 01:53:39,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, thank you for taking my call.

1152
01:53:41,452 --> 01:53:46,216
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hearing a lot about Cambridge and Somerville, and my comment pertains to Cambridge and Somerville.

1153
01:53:49,559 --> 01:53:53,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the larger complexes in Cambridge and Somerville

1154
01:53:54,953 --> 01:54:12,406
[SPEAKER_11]: made it easier for people to travel by providing either zip car service at the locations of these complexes that have hundreds of units in one location, or maybe a shuttle bus to and from the nearest MBTA stations.

1155
01:54:12,987 --> 01:54:21,093
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not sure how that is going to impact what you're looking at in terms of parking, but I think it allows people

1156
01:54:22,218 --> 01:54:40,485
[SPEAKER_11]: an option to having to drive and um you know I'm not sure if how that's going to affect what you're looking to do with the numbers or um with with the you know your agenda with this whole

1157
01:54:41,367 --> 01:54:47,114
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, information gathering, but, um, I just think it would make it much easier for people to get around.

1158
01:54:47,935 --> 01:54:53,541
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, you know, it's nice to sometimes not be able to drive.

1159
01:54:53,741 --> 01:54:56,064
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to share that comment.

1160
01:54:56,164 --> 01:54:56,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1161
01:54:58,858 --> 01:55:04,360
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll just quickly share that the city is doing some stuff around that.

1162
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:10,342
[SPEAKER_16]: So one is when we talk about transportation demand management, this is something that we can do with the larger buildings.

1163
01:55:10,743 --> 01:55:14,444
[SPEAKER_16]: We are asking them, encouraging them to have spaces for zip cars.

1164
01:55:14,544 --> 01:55:18,325
[SPEAKER_16]: That is something that they do look at and we are working with.

1165
01:55:19,126 --> 01:55:22,047
[SPEAKER_16]: They are doing shuttle services to the Ts.

1166
01:55:22,747 --> 01:55:27,269
[SPEAKER_16]: and shared shuttle, that's the kind of thing that we can do with the larger and newer buildings.

1167
01:55:28,309 --> 01:55:29,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of them already have that.

1168
01:55:30,190 --> 01:55:35,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Rivers Edge has a shuttle that goes from their residential buildings down to the Wellington T-Stop.

1169
01:55:35,372 --> 01:55:36,633
[SPEAKER_16]: So some of that is happening.

1170
01:55:36,953 --> 01:55:41,675
[SPEAKER_16]: The City, as one of the speakers did allude to, has an on-demand service

1171
01:55:42,230 --> 01:55:45,973
[SPEAKER_16]: that the city pays for through our community development block grant.

1172
01:55:46,073 --> 01:56:00,544
[SPEAKER_16]: It's advertised to the senior center for seniors and people with disabilities where you sign up and the system will drive you to doctor's offices, doctor's appointments.

1173
01:56:01,104 --> 01:56:06,305
[SPEAKER_16]: in grocery shuttles and we are looking, we have a working group that's looking at how can we make this less expensive?

1174
01:56:06,985 --> 01:56:14,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Could we subsidize Lyft and Uber for some people rather than sending a shuttle van to their homes as needed?

1175
01:56:14,527 --> 01:56:27,689
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are doing a project with the MAPC right now looking at the potentials for fixed route service in Medford or more shuttles and stuff to try and help move people around without everybody having to use single use vehicles.

1176
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:30,210
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are some of the studies that are going on.

1177
01:56:30,710 --> 01:56:33,833
[SPEAKER_16]: And we do continue to add bike lanes walkability.

1178
01:56:33,973 --> 01:56:40,219
[SPEAKER_16]: We are also funding some crosswalk improvement programs as stuff like that.

1179
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:45,204
[SPEAKER_16]: So, those other things are happening as well, and we appreciate the feedback on it.

1180
01:56:45,685 --> 01:56:47,046
[SPEAKER_16]: And so now we're going to go to 1 in the room.

1181
01:56:53,085 --> 01:56:54,765
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, I'm Caitlin Robinson.

1182
01:56:54,785 --> 01:57:10,589
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm really concerned with this idea that eliminating parking minimums would have to be a long term change that happens after we've made other modes better, when the reason that other modes are worse now are because of these kinds of policies that prioritize cars.

1183
01:57:11,649 --> 01:57:13,949
[SPEAKER_31]: We've had parking minimums for a long time.

1184
01:57:14,629 --> 01:57:17,250
[SPEAKER_31]: We still have a lot of complaints about parking and

1185
01:57:17,890 --> 01:57:31,924
[SPEAKER_31]: I think I think we need to go ahead, eliminate parking minimums, let people have choice, not everyone needs a parking space and it's pretty ridiculous to mandate that people who don't have a car have our infrastructure on their property when

1186
01:57:32,485 --> 01:57:34,706
[SPEAKER_31]: they don't want or need that.

1187
01:57:34,886 --> 01:57:51,993
[SPEAKER_31]: And it should be done in tandem with changes to public policy about how we regulate public spaces because it doesn't have to mean that eliminating parking minimums means all of a sudden it's just chaos and public spaces because we can set policy on that.

1188
01:57:52,333 --> 01:57:52,593
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1189
01:57:57,912 --> 01:58:00,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Roberta Cameron.

1190
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:06,957
[SPEAKER_18]: I live in the hillside area and I wanted to offer you ask for personal experiences.

1191
01:58:07,557 --> 01:58:09,338
[SPEAKER_18]: I've lived there for 30 years.

1192
01:58:09,578 --> 01:58:15,661
[SPEAKER_18]: And over that time, most of the time we've worked in locations where we can't take a car.

1193
01:58:16,248 --> 01:58:21,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Because there's no place to park at the other location, downtown Boston, the long wood area.

1194
01:58:23,151 --> 01:58:25,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Can Kendall square area?

1195
01:58:25,572 --> 01:58:32,196
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't take a car, but we've also gone through a period of time when 1 of us was working out on the 125, 128 area and.

1196
01:58:35,751 --> 01:58:40,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Getting from Route 2 to Mass Ave was half the commute.

1197
01:58:41,277 --> 01:58:46,442
[SPEAKER_18]: And so transportation demand management would be really helpful in both of those instances.

1198
01:58:46,963 --> 01:58:54,752
[SPEAKER_18]: My commute has, for a long time, involved walking a mile or a mile and a half to get to where I pick up public transportation.

1199
01:58:55,392 --> 01:58:59,433
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would be really helpful to have more options.

1200
01:58:59,833 --> 01:59:03,794
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would really like to see us accelerate giving everybody more options.

1201
01:59:04,154 --> 01:59:08,195
[SPEAKER_18]: My second point is that we have very limited land area in Medford.

1202
01:59:08,595 --> 01:59:15,937
[SPEAKER_18]: So as much as we provide to very land hogging cars, we don't have for green space.

1203
01:59:15,997 --> 01:59:20,138
[SPEAKER_18]: My neighbor paved their whole backyard so that they can park more cars.

1204
01:59:22,018 --> 01:59:27,501
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I would like to see us have incentives.

1205
01:59:27,521 --> 01:59:32,263
[SPEAKER_18]: To rely less on on creating new parking.

1206
01:59:33,123 --> 01:59:39,666
[SPEAKER_18]: On to rely more on using the existing pavement that we already have, especially on private property.

1207
01:59:40,186 --> 01:59:54,697
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we stop building more parking for every single lot, we give every other lot that already has enough parking or more than enough parking incentives to make that parking available for their neighbors.

1208
01:59:55,297 --> 02:00:13,203
[SPEAKER_18]: so i'd like to see more creating incentives for using the pavement that already exists in the city instead of creating more pavement and i think that reducing or eliminating parking minimums is going to make more choices and a more functional market driven

1209
02:00:14,487 --> 02:00:31,711
[SPEAKER_18]: system for allocating the space to whatever uses we want in the city, including driving as much as people want to, that a more market-driven approach will more efficiently get people to where they want to go using whatever mode of transportation they want to take.

1210
02:00:40,753 --> 02:00:41,993
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we have one more online.

1211
02:00:48,957 --> 02:00:54,960
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to take two more in the room and then we'll take somebody on Zoom.

1212
02:00:55,500 --> 02:01:00,923
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think someone mentioned the market more like kind of free market approach.

1213
02:01:00,963 --> 02:01:05,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem with this is that so it will eliminate parking minimums and it's creating an externality.

1214
02:01:06,686 --> 02:01:14,070
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this externality, the problem is that the decision maker, which in this case will be assuming there's no parking minimums, will be the developer.

1215
02:01:14,890 --> 02:01:21,614
[SPEAKER_01]: who decides whether to build something with parking or not, is not the one that is going to bear the cost if there's no parking.

1216
02:01:21,894 --> 02:01:28,238
[SPEAKER_01]: So I live two miles from rapid transit, and if you look around my neighbors, the average number of cars is definitely above two.

1217
02:01:28,438 --> 02:01:32,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one, so this doesn't apply to me, but I'm talking in general for everyone else.

1218
02:01:33,822 --> 02:01:42,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly, if the developer comes and builds something without any parking where I live, then those cars, the people that move there are going to own

1219
02:01:43,298 --> 02:01:45,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably 1, 2, sometimes 3, I have a neighbor with 4.

1220
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:48,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's perfectly fine, by the way.

1221
02:01:48,721 --> 02:01:55,205
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's perfectly fine if my neighbor decides to pave their backyard, so they want to park their cars there.

1222
02:01:55,405 --> 02:01:57,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Who am I to say, no, don't do that.

1223
02:02:00,193 --> 02:02:01,894
[SPEAKER_01]: those cars are going to go to the street.

1224
02:02:02,294 --> 02:02:06,415
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I'm kind of confused when you say like car management is not part of the discussion.

1225
02:02:06,455 --> 02:02:14,297
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, car management should be an intrinsic part of the discussion because those cars now are going to end up on the streets.

1226
02:02:15,138 --> 02:02:21,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might have existing residents that don't have enough parking on their lots that are using the streets now.

1227
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:26,041
[SPEAKER_01]: And now because there's no off street parking because the developer doesn't bear the costs,

1228
02:02:28,046 --> 02:02:39,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that those spots might become taken and now for existing residents becomes much harder now to park their car, which means that our quality of life, the quality of life of existing residents goes down.

1229
02:02:39,696 --> 02:02:47,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also when new people come and buy a house, they don't pay too much attention to like, oh, I don't have parking off street, but I'm gonna find somewhere on the road.

1230
02:02:47,784 --> 02:02:52,328
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way to deal with this is that we actually need a car management strategy.

1231
02:02:53,425 --> 02:03:10,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to be able, if we're going to go with this route of eliminating parking minimums, then I think we need to make sure that the cost of buying something without off-street parking, which is totally fine as people have mentioned, we should give the customer the choice.

1232
02:03:10,834 --> 02:03:14,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to buy something with parking or I want to buy something without parking.

1233
02:03:14,436 --> 02:03:18,118
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they buy something without parking, it should be very clear what cost or not.

1234
02:03:18,658 --> 02:03:19,439
[SPEAKER_01]: they are going to take.

1235
02:03:19,779 --> 02:03:31,287
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the current management structure, for example, we could have block-level permit quotas where if you get assigned a permit per dwelling,

1236
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:36,744
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's capped by whatever curb capacity we have in that area.

1237
02:03:37,484 --> 02:03:38,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked this up.

1238
02:03:38,145 --> 02:03:39,886
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually implemented in Portland.

1239
02:03:39,906 --> 02:03:42,929
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a little zone in Portland that has it in Toronto, the same thing.

1240
02:03:43,670 --> 02:03:50,896
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to let you know, though, demand is over 140% supply, which means that there's a wait list.

1241
02:03:51,496 --> 02:03:54,138
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that are trying to get parking and they cannot.

1242
02:03:54,158 --> 02:03:57,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might be trying to sell new residence.

1243
02:03:57,159 --> 02:04:03,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Some existing resident might want to buy a new car and then there's no place to park it and they cannot buy it because they will have to park it who knows where.

1244
02:04:03,843 --> 02:04:11,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as the cost is bear, you know, it's bear born whatever it is.

1245
02:04:13,088 --> 02:04:15,310
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as residents bear the costs,

1246
02:04:16,330 --> 02:04:18,651
[SPEAKER_01]: of their decision, right?

1247
02:04:18,671 --> 02:04:34,660
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna buy this house, this house doesn't have off street parking, and there's no parking availability on the corpse, so I will have to leave without a car, and they're willing to do that choice, then I think that's a free market approach.

1248
02:04:35,341 --> 02:04:38,543
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we don't have that restriction, it's a free for all,

1249
02:04:39,752 --> 02:04:44,496
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of funding on-street parking, then I think that is chaos.

1250
02:04:45,016 --> 02:04:57,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And moreover, for us existing residents, we're going to be paying the price primarily, because as I said, we're going to have to park blocks away from our house, when now it's like we can park right in front of it.

1251
02:04:57,526 --> 02:04:58,567
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it's fair.

1252
02:04:58,647 --> 02:05:06,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look forward to the car management approach discussion, which I think should be an intrinsic part of this discussion.

1253
02:05:06,113 --> 02:05:08,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1254
02:05:10,287 --> 02:05:11,748
[SPEAKER_22]: We would love to talk with you about it.

1255
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:14,531
[SPEAKER_22]: We have one minute before we're getting kicked out.

1256
02:05:14,691 --> 02:05:17,933
[SPEAKER_22]: So we have one more person online and one more person in the room.

1257
02:05:17,954 --> 02:05:20,255
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, let's do online first.

1258
02:05:20,696 --> 02:05:25,280
[SPEAKER_22]: And then just so we end with somebody in the room, if that's okay.

1259
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:27,461
[SPEAKER_22]: So you will be our last speaker in the room.

1260
02:05:27,541 --> 02:05:29,203
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll do the last speaker online.

1261
02:05:29,223 --> 02:05:30,744
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we will thank you all.

1262
02:05:32,425 --> 02:05:35,388
[SPEAKER_16]: And so Jared Nussbaum, I'm going to unmute you.

1263
02:05:39,173 --> 02:05:39,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1264
02:05:39,913 --> 02:05:41,194
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm Jared.

1265
02:05:41,214 --> 02:05:45,057
[SPEAKER_12]: I live in West Medford in a duplex that has off-street parking.

1266
02:05:45,737 --> 02:05:50,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I look specifically for a place with off-street parking and was willing to pay more for it.

1267
02:05:51,461 --> 02:05:58,626
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a good amenity, but I don't think parking minimums should be the way that they're created.

1268
02:05:58,666 --> 02:06:00,167
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be demand-based.

1269
02:06:01,028 --> 02:06:08,653
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think you should eliminate parking minimums and to deal with on-street parking problems

1270
02:06:09,143 --> 02:06:16,167
[SPEAKER_12]: that may arise from that, that should be the car management system, like permitting, not parking minimums.

1271
02:06:17,007 --> 02:06:17,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1272
02:06:23,590 --> 02:06:32,335
[SPEAKER_24]: Stephanie Gernsmeier, 54, Whitney Road, walk score 42, but 24 years without a car.

1273
02:06:33,956 --> 02:06:37,598
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think we're that weird, but at any rate,

1274
02:06:38,745 --> 02:06:43,886
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I'm all for finding ways to actually attract more people who are car free.

1275
02:06:45,647 --> 02:06:51,828
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'm also sympathetic to the whole, you know, I do think zoning and project and parking management should go together.

1276
02:06:52,488 --> 02:06:58,590
[SPEAKER_24]: What I'm wondering about is like, cul-de-sac, Tempe, Arizona.

1277
02:06:58,910 --> 02:06:59,770
[SPEAKER_24]: So how do they do it?

1278
02:07:00,110 --> 02:07:08,492
[SPEAKER_24]: How do they, I mean, it's way larger than anything we do here, but there must be ways that you actually can build, you know,

1279
02:07:10,553 --> 02:07:22,887
[SPEAKER_24]: units, housing development, where there is zero parking, where nobody there is even allowed to own a car, and therefore you're not putting the pressure on the neighbors.

1280
02:07:22,907 --> 02:07:25,249
[SPEAKER_24]: You're actually making life better for the people who do.

1281
02:07:26,731 --> 02:07:27,371
[SPEAKER_24]: Can we do that?

1282
02:07:29,545 --> 02:07:35,789
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's a question we can't answer tonight, but it's certainly a question that we can continue to consider as we move forward.

1283
02:07:37,110 --> 02:07:38,271
[SPEAKER_22]: We're getting ready to leave.

1284
02:07:38,371 --> 02:07:39,832
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to thank everybody.

1285
02:07:39,952 --> 02:07:43,994
[SPEAKER_22]: If you have time to write something on your way out, we would really appreciate that.

1286
02:07:44,494 --> 02:07:46,676
[SPEAKER_22]: Next stop planning and permitting on Wednesday.

1287
02:07:46,736 --> 02:07:53,360
[SPEAKER_22]: Really appreciate for online and the people in the room and to the Bedford Library for giving us this space.

1288
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:54,381
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much.
