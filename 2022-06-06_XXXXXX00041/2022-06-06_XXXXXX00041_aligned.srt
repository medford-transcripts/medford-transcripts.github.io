00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:05,274
Hey, Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:06,715
As promised, Ms.

3
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:13,180
Whalen's eighth grade class from the Andrews Middle School is back to present a continuation of their work regarding their dress code.

4
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:18,905
A school committee meeting that will discuss this very topic and the feedback of these students is happening tonight.

5
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:25,310
I really hope you enjoy the students' thoughtful insights into their dress code policy and ways that they're fighting for equity.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,131
All right, I'm here with Ms.

7
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:33,632
Whalen's class at the Andrews Middle School.

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,554
We're doing an update on the No Cap podcast.

9
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:43,877
And a couple of students are gonna start by sharing their favorite place to eat in Medford and what they like to eat there.

10
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:45,658
Let's do it first.

11
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:49,140
So if you could say your name, pronouns, and then answer the question.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,282
My name's Giancarlo, he, him, and I like to eat at Bob's Italian Foods.

13
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:58,999
My name is Duke, my pronouns are he, him, and I like to eat at Ronnie's place.

14
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,580
My name is Moncello, my pronouns are he, him, and I like to eat at Michi's.

15
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:09,862
My name is Frank, he, him, and I like to eat at Columns.

16
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:11,623
Great, thank you.

17
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:25,133
So if we could start off, I know we listened to your podcast where you ended talking about how you wanted to go to the school committee to share some of your thoughts and ideas about the dress code and the student handbook.

18
00:01:25,914 --> 00:01:28,834
And we also have school committee member Paul Rousseau here to join us.

19
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:34,036
But if anybody wants to give an update about what's happened since you guys recorded that podcast.

20
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,684
We're getting closer to going up to school committee to introduce our idea.

21
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:54,970
We also got a proposal to a new dress code from committee member Russo.

22
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:09,640
Just getting a lot of feedback from and help from school committee members and other members such.

23
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:11,445
Thank you.

24
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:17,069
And could anybody share what some of that feedback was, what you shared with the school committee about changes to the dress code?

25
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,113
So we were petitioning against the hats and hoods rule because we wanted to wear them.

26
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:34,319
And some of the other girls and some boys wanted to wear like tighter t-shirts or like different style clothing that's usually dress coded.

27
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,641
So we were also sort of petitioning against that.

28
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:51,579
So that's something I think what you mentioned there at the end was something that you that you didn't get a chance to talk about in the no cap episode which was beyond hats and hoods What are some of the other issues with the dress code that you guys have thought about or proposed ideas for?

29
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,824
There's a

30
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:09,280
It's a lot of, it's very targeted towards certain groups of people based on body type and race and sex, other things like that.

31
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:11,223
Thank you.

32
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:13,145
Does anybody want to share a little bit more about that?

33
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:31,047
I myself have gotten dress-coded for the type of shirt I've worn, but I've seen that other females that have different body types haven't gotten dress-coded, and I asked them, have they gotten dress-coded, and they said no.

34
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:38,831
So you're saying somebody could be wearing almost the exact same outfit as you, but because their body type is different, they're not getting the same?

35
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:39,771
Yeah.

36
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:41,232
Thanks for sharing that.

37
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:43,853
Anybody else?

38
00:03:46,142 --> 00:04:07,621
very targeted towards different people mostly colored people because I think they see them as quote-unquote like hoodlums or stuff like that as a racist like notation or what's it called stereotype

39
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:19,285
I was really struck by some of the stuff you talked about in the first episode about the different types of people that were targeted differently for wearing hats and hoods and sort of why.

40
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:25,551
So I think there was some talk about like, if you're wearing a hood, women might not be able to identify you in a fight, right?

41
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:29,855
So equating violence with that type of clothing, right?

42
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:34,340
And then also your point, Carlos, about how that intersects with race, too.

43
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:39,825
How about Mr. Russo, anything that you'd like to add or think about?

44
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:40,365
Sure.

45
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:47,909
We did meet on, I believe, this past Wednesday, our final subcommittee meeting on the new dress code.

46
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,831
And it was very interesting.

47
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:55,713
The conversation went long.

48
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:57,674
The meeting went longer than it was planned for.

49
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:05,397
And the conversation really centered on the differences between the policy around gender.

50
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:15,650
We had already covered stuff around body type, and certainly hats and hoods are, if this pass will be allowed.

51
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:24,052
And footwear was something I think some of the students actually wrote about in their feedback that I received.

52
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:31,873
But this past Wednesday, the differences in gender were really on display.

53
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:33,874
I highly recommend watching if it's on YouTube.

54
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:56,725
You know, there was a lot of conversation around, it felt like the policy conversation was centered around students who might want to make a statement, which we talked about, you know, what if, and it was explicit, what if girls wanted to come to school in a two-piece bikini?

55
00:05:58,386 --> 00:06:05,671
And I mean, aside from the fact that I don't know all the girls in the school, but I don't suspect a lot of them have any interest in that.

56
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:22,344
But that kind of evolved a bit into, well, so if it's bathing suits, then boys might want to wear bathing suit bottoms to school, and nobody's going to dress code them for it.

57
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:28,966
So this idea that the rules need to be the same for everybody, whatever they end up being.

58
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,046
They have to be the same.

59
00:06:31,127 --> 00:06:34,268
And society is not done with sexism at all.

60
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:38,770
As everybody here surely understands, it's still pervasive.

61
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:44,794
But it was a very interesting conversation and somewhat heated, actually.

62
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:48,597
So that's where we finished.

63
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,119
Yeah, I'm curious for the students.

64
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:55,622
So it sounds like you've made some really great observations about what's wrong with the dress code.

65
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:59,905
And I wonder if you have any thoughts about what a fair dress code might look like.

66
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:10,614
a fair dress code problem with just them dress coding boys and girls, not just females.

67
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:17,599
Because I haven't seen them dress code boys about the certain type of shirts they wear at school, like showing their shoulders.

68
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:25,566
But in the handbook, I think it says when females show their shoulders, it's distracting to boys.

69
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:30,270
So I want them to think about when the boys show their shoulders, what does it do to females?

70
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,408
That's a great point.

71
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:37,171
And I was actually going to ask about that, what the tank top rule is.

72
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:44,636
So a girl showing her shoulders is not OK, but a boy wearing a tank top, it sounds like, is seen and enforced differently.

73
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:59,503
Yeah, it is less dress-coded when a boy wears like a tight white tank top or something like that, but the teachers do tell the boys to put like an overshirt or something because their muscles are out or whatever that is.

74
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,345
So I've seen it before, but it's like a lot less than the girls.

75
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:08,109
What do you think about this point that you brought up about distraction?

76
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:14,515
I feel like shoulders aren't as attracting to me.

77
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:23,000
If a female comes to school with a crop top that's sleeveless, I don't feel like it's distracting.

78
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,581
It's just a part of a human body.

79
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:26,522
Everyone has shoulders.

80
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:28,003
It's not attracting.

81
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:34,247
But I haven't seen boys just come up to a female and say, oh, you have nice shoulders.

82
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:35,747
It hasn't happened.

83
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:41,699
Yeah, and that their responsibility for distraction is on the girls, it sounds like.

84
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:41,799
Yeah.

85
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,840
And so I'm thinking of a scenario, right?

86
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,761
Right now, it's very warm in here, right?

87
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:47,801
Like, I'm sweating.

88
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:56,685
And so I wonder how distracting it would be to have to wear more clothing than you're comfortable in because of the weather, right?

89
00:08:56,945 --> 00:09:03,968
And that being a distraction for the person wearing the clothing while sort of not thinking about the other distraction.

90
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:07,008
Can I just say something about distraction?

91
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:07,288
Please.

92
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:19,194
So distraction is one of the responses I got and the feedback from the students was truly fascinating in that it looked at the word distraction from a perspective I hadn't considered.

93
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:26,138
Just using the word distraction actually is, in my mind, is a problem.

94
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:32,782
It's actually part of the policy because I think it will be understood, but the notion

95
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,262
another person is a distraction really is problematic.

96
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:46,805
But this is an educational setting where I think learning how to cope with distractions.

97
00:09:49,646 --> 00:10:01,732
I mean, we're all out in life outside of school, and other people may be wearing things, saying things, doing things that we find uncomfortable, or we really are comfortable with them.

98
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:11,620
And it's not on those people to be changed so that we can be comfortable.

99
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:19,404
There was a time when people who had physical disabilities in this country, literally, they were not out in society.

100
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:20,824
They were locked up in buildings.

101
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:22,745
And that was not to protect them.

102
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:26,127
That was so that the rest of us didn't have to see them.

103
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:28,848
And we gave that up a long time ago, thankfully.

104
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:42,850
But this notion that we should live our lives and never experience anything that we find uncomfortable and distracting is not a future I want to live in.

105
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:50,434
And learning how to deal with things that are distracting is part of growing up.

106
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,794
A couple of you mentioned the enforcement of the dress code.

107
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:59,777
So can anyone describe what happens when you get dress coded?

108
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:03,320
You get a referral.

109
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,581
It's on your record.

110
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:05,762
Not like, not your record.

111
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:06,563
It's on your name.

112
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:08,965
So it's like how many referrals you get.

113
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:10,306
You get social probation.

114
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:16,452
But it's a referral that you get and then just a random referral about you getting dress coded.

115
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:19,333
Just a quick word about this answer.

116
00:11:19,353 --> 00:11:22,014
The teachers wanted me to let you know that

117
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:53,500
Social probation is only if there's a certain number of referrals within a specific time period, and more serious violations result in referrals.

118
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:04,364
So theoretically, you could get enough referrals about the dress code for a student to be put on social probation, but that's not usually the sole reason a student could be placed on social probation.

119
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:16,957
One reason for getting a referral could be the way that someone responds to being dress coded, and if that's done in a way that is disrespectful, sometimes that can result in a referral.

120
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:44,029
another thing I noticed I'm pretty sure in the handbook it says like no open-toe shoes are allowed which I disagree with because I like to wear my like slides or sandals or whatever but they don't dress code us on slides or like crocs or whatever we have like I've seen I've seen people wear open-toe shoes sometimes no socks but they don't dress code them but they would dress code for like a short skirt or a hoodie or something similar

121
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:49,617
Yeah, and the close-toe shoes, which I'm violating that rule right now.

122
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:54,560
It seems like a safety thing versus what we're talking about, like distraction.

123
00:12:56,821 --> 00:13:02,705
It sounds like a little bit of a calling out, too, and I wonder about what it feels like to be dress-coded.

124
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:15,110
It feels, I like, whenever I get dress coded, I have an argument about it because it's not fair to get dress coded and nobody else, like, the other people that I've seen haven't got dress coded.

125
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,796
So I argue about it, I said, like, why dress code me when there's no one else that's being dress coded but me?

126
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:21,597
Yeah.

127
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:38,038
another thing that's very unfair is say a boy wears a hoodie they'll just tell him to take it off but then when a girl wears like a certain type of like clothing a short skirt or like open shoulder shirt they'll get a referral while the boy wouldn't get a referral for a hoodie

128
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:47,708
I remember when I was in middle school, spaghetti straps, I don't know if this is still thin, but they're like skinny tank tops that mostly girls would wear.

129
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:52,589
I remember a friend being called out in class and then being sent home to change.

130
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:58,130
And that, like if we're talking about disruptions and distractions, she missed part of her day at school for that.

131
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:07,292
And so yeah, it does seem like there is more than just like a rule enforcement here.

132
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:20,582
Yeah, like, my friend has a hoodie that she wore to school one day, and they made her go home and change and come back with a different hoodie.

133
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:28,044
But recently I saw a boy wear a shirt with the, like, whatever the hoodie had, and he didn't get sent home.

134
00:14:28,144 --> 00:14:29,064
He stayed in school.

135
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:32,525
The only thing the principal did was just talk to him about it.

136
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:32,825
That's it.

137
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:46,771
another thing is i'm not gonna say the name of this boy but he comes to school every day with like a open ribbed tank top and nobody dress codes him about it and he has uh big muscles but

138
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,510
And it's kind of exposing his ribs.

139
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,871
But he doesn't get dress code, and nobody talks to him about it.

140
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:55,451
So I'm just saying it's very inequitable.

141
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:57,872
I wonder, too, about clothes.

142
00:14:58,032 --> 00:14:59,752
You talk about clothes that maybe don't fit.

143
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:02,213
And sometimes we think that's a fashion choice.

144
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:14,115
And sometimes it may be an issue of being able to afford new clothes and how that could be unequally enforced among kids based on their socioeconomic status.

145
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:20,969
So how did you guys feel about bringing this to the school committee?

146
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,191
It feels good.

147
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,152
I like that we're trying to change it.

148
00:15:26,732 --> 00:15:30,414
And I think we might have a chance at succeeding.

149
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,556
Wasn't a chance, for sure.

150
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:37,117
Yeah, Paul, how did it feel to get feedback from the students?

151
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:38,398
The feedback was incredible.

152
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:39,259
I didn't expect it.

153
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:43,181
It just came out of the blue, the written feedback.

154
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,142
And I mean, it was great.

155
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:49,944
I mean, I don't know if it's part of an English assignment, but it was well written.

156
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:55,346
And I know there's an obsession with how many paragraphs for MCAS and all that stuff.

157
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:58,188
But it was well written, well thought out.

158
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:09,193
And really, I didn't need to reply and ask questions, which is great, because then I could just take it in.

159
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:14,435
And mostly, it just affirmed where we were headed with the new policy.

160
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:35,029
And so that, you know, one of the things in a couple of the feedback emails we got was there is a desire that I sort of got from the emails to have sort of like an explicit list of what's allowed.

161
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:45,492
And I understand that desire because the concern is interpretation, that everybody reading it will think something different.

162
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:54,495
The challenge I had with including a list of explicit things that can be worn was, first of all, that's going to change continuously.

163
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:57,998
It would be hard to have an exhaustive list.

164
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:11,427
And looking at the core point of the policy, it's just like you wear a top, you wear a bottom, you wear something on your feet.

165
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:23,124
In my mind, at least for now, that is enough to say that anything that's a top, a bottom, or something on your feet is considered OK.

166
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:36,854
If after, you know, after this rolls out in the fall, assuming it passes, it's not working the way we want, we simply go back and edit it and change it.

167
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:41,197
That's the nice thing about policy, unlike law, which is a real pain to change.

168
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:46,236
we can just bring the policy up at the next meeting and literally change it right then and there if we need to.

169
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:51,598
So if we've made any mistakes, which definitely happens, we'll fix it.

170
00:17:53,378 --> 00:18:07,803
I also feel like it's very unfair because it might feel on how the teacher feels that day, or it might just be on that teacher's opinion rather than the actual rules or how exposing the piece of clothing is.

171
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:19,417
But we did talk about that, actually, in the last meeting on Wednesday, exactly that issue that respect is a very, very squishy word.

172
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:28,865
And when I grew up, what it meant to be respectfully dressed was different than probably the people who graduated five years after me and five years after that.

173
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,706
It's continuously changing.

174
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:37,052
But my idea of respect is based on what I experienced as a teenager.

175
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:38,393
It hasn't changed.

176
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,552
I mean, and I think for most adults, that's the case.

177
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:50,118
So as you point out, each individual teacher will probably have a different idea of what's respectfully dressed.

178
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:55,862
And that's an impossible ask for students to know.

179
00:18:57,223 --> 00:19:00,105
So that's why it's important that the policy be the same.

180
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:07,790
And that, in many regards, the comfort level of the individual teachers and other staff members

181
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:12,796
can't be part of the policy, because it's different for every one of them.

182
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:24,679
It sounds like without having lists of things that you can and can't wear, and making this sort of more vague policy helps it to be less objective, right?

183
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:28,340
Like we can say, you're wearing a top, a bottom, and shoes, you pass.

184
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,701
Right.

185
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:37,663
And Mr. Oso, is there a timeline for when we should be paying attention to this coming up in school committee, or when you all vote on it?

186
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:48,484
Sure, the next school committee meeting where it will be presented for hopefully approval, I'm pretty confident it will be approved, is on June 6.

187
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:54,848
And then we'll discuss, I mean, that's almost the end of the school year.

188
00:19:55,428 --> 00:20:03,854
It's generally not a good idea to try and change the policy that all of the staff and students understand within days of the end of school.

189
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,115
So it would roll out in the fall.

190
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:11,723
how that would get rolled out and how everybody would get notified, handbooks get updated.

191
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:15,325
That's not a school committee thing, but yeah, so.

192
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:18,166
So hopefully by the fall, if we have time, we can come back.

193
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:19,846
Great.

194
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:23,528
Mr. Russo, I actually have a question for you, and that was,

195
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:26,405
Wow, I actually forgot my question.

196
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:27,365
That's OK.

197
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:28,146
What did you think of it?

198
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:31,287
OK, yeah, I'll let you know.

199
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:33,909
But as all of you know, you can participate in that meeting.

200
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:38,591
You can share your support vocally, verbally at that meeting, either by Zoom or in person.

201
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:40,352
You remember?

202
00:20:40,552 --> 00:20:41,713
OK, so I remember.

203
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:45,975
So is the handbook the same for the high school as the middle schools?

204
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:48,036
Is that the same handbook?

205
00:20:50,312 --> 00:20:54,655
There are sections of the handbooks for all levels of school that are the same.

206
00:20:57,218 --> 00:21:00,340
Middle and high school, certainly, this would be the same.

207
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,322
I don't know if in elementary school they would be a little different.

208
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:09,447
They have recess, and I think there's recess in middle school still?

209
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:09,968
Yeah.

210
00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:10,148
Yeah.

211
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:16,092
But when you're dealing with five-year-olds, I think there might be some differences around how they implement

212
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:20,735
what's an OK thing to wear when you're going outside and it's 25 degrees.

213
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:35,201
My own son's 15, and I'm going to bet plenty of people in this room have gone outside in frigid weather in a t-shirt and shorts and been perfectly fine, because you all somehow don't experience cold.

214
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:42,324
But allowing a five-year-old to do that is probably not something that they'd want to allow at the elementary level.

215
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:45,846
But certainly middle and high school, that language should be exactly the same.

216
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:48,787
So they do also share the hoodie rule, correct?

217
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:54,270
Well, at the high school right now, I have no idea whether hoodies are allowed or not.

218
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,453
And I think that's part of the problem with the current policy is there's a lot of room for interpretation.

219
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:10,299
And not even interpretation, just a lot of room for individual principals to make up their own mind about what does the policy say.

220
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,242
The new policy should take that away and make it consistent

221
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:19,979
Does anybody else have any other questions or things they want to add?

222
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,941
This started as like a question in your civics class, right?

223
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:29,222
And who remembers when you started this project?

224
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:40,525
So what happened, we were trying to edit the Constitution, and I think it was like the Senate, like we made up

225
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:45,380
the House of Representatives and the President and the Senate in our civic class.

226
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:54,549
And so I was a part of the Senate, and I think one of the girls who wasn't here was also a part of the Senate.

227
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,413
And then Marcello and Will were part of the Senate.

228
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,417
And we were trying to joke around saying that we would like

229
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:08,556
Find a way to make a rule to allow hats and hoods and we weren't actually being serious.

230
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:12,117
I don't think but Mr. Tremonti our civics teacher.

231
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,758
He heard it and he thought we were acting serious.

232
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,238
I'm pretty sure so he actually Wanted us to do it and now we are here.

233
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,119
How long ago did that start?

234
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:25,580
I want to say I like the beginning of the year Okay

235
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:27,670
Well, that's great.

236
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,872
So that's only a few months to go from now.

237
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:35,576
And you guys have managed to come up with a plan, write some feedback, deliver it to school committee.

238
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:41,220
And Mr. Russo is saying, likely be able to implement a change in the dress code by next week.

239
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:41,740
Yeah.

240
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,202
I think that's pretty incredible.

241
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:47,004
I'm getting really chills.

242
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:47,805
Like, it's amazing.

243
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:55,930
And on school committee, it's like, the school committee, we're not doing this, no offense to teachers.

244
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,831
We're not doing it for teachers.

245
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:58,164
And we're not doing it for parents.

246
00:23:58,184 --> 00:24:00,666
We're doing it for kids and young adults.

247
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:06,812
And it's the hardest thing is getting to hear from you all.

248
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:17,463
So this is just, for me, it's very exciting because, you know, hopefully this will be an example of how you can actually affect and change how things operate.

249
00:24:19,677 --> 00:24:23,058
Personally, I never thought we would even like be in this situation.

250
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:42,323
Yeah, I thought we were just gonna like not get too far with it But then it turned into like a really big thing as John Carlos said, you know, like we're here Persistent and made some compelling arguments Okay, so my final question

251
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:49,878
What is meaningful for you about being able to sort of wear whatever you feel comfortable in, whatever you want, being able to choose your own clothes for school?

252
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:52,720
We can express ourselves in the way that we feel.

253
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:58,125
It distinguishes us from everybody else and it shows our uniqueness.

254
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:01,347
It shows who we are.

255
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:06,972
Make you feel comfortable around the people that you need to go to see every day.

256
00:25:06,992 --> 00:25:09,374
It can make you feel more positive.

257
00:25:10,895 --> 00:25:11,616
Represent stuff.

258
00:25:13,627 --> 00:25:16,749
I think it's one of the good things about public school, not having to wear a uniform.

259
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,811
Yeah, no uniform.

260
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:27,117
Well, I really appreciate you all being here, being willing to share this all with me.

261
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:28,678
So thank you so much.

262
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:30,139
Thank you.

263
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,614
Thanks so much to Ms.

264
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:44,335
Whalen's class and to Paul Russo.

265
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:46,996
