[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like we're good to go.

4
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:27,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Medford Community Development Board.

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,202
[SPEAKER_02]: In Chair Hedman's absence, I will be chairing the meeting tonight.

6
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:39,765
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ben, and myself Vice Chair Peter Calvis, I'm present.

26
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:35,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get started tonight, Danielle, could you introduce any city staff on the call.

27
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

28
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:43,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Danielle Evans, senior planner in the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability and also with me is

29
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Alicia hunt, who is the director of planning development and sustainability.

30
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:52,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is everyone from city staff with us tonight.

31
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:54,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

32
00:02:54,163 --> 00:03:01,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Danielle and thank you Alicia for being here and Alicia for putting the link in the chat to the current meeting materials.

33
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:13,029
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing up on the agenda is the continued public hearing for the neighborhood residential and urban residential zoning amendments.

34
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:28,235
[SPEAKER_02]: A reminder to all present that this is the third meeting for the continued public hearing that was opened on April 2nd regarding the proposed zoning amendment for the creation of neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts.

35
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:32,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to ask city staff if they have any

36
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:39,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Introductory remarks before we pass it off to Innis Associates to discuss the new information.

37
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:44,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Mr. Chair.

38
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:53,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to state that we know that some of the application materials or the zoning materials were late coming.

39
00:03:54,867 --> 00:04:01,430
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are not going to have the community development board vote tonight, but rather continue this to

40
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:09,950
[SPEAKER_06]: vote till 21st to make a recommendation to city council who will then be able to open the hearing on May 27th.

41
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:18,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll give time for the public, staff, the board to really absorb all the information.

42
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:27,484
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an incredible amount of analysis and information to go through as

43
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:37,200
[SPEAKER_06]: the residential zoning districts encompass the majority of the land area of the city, and different parts of the city have different characteristics.

44
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:53,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So we really need to take into account some of those unique qualities of certain neighborhoods to make sure that we are zoning in an appropriate way for those areas.

45
00:04:56,678 --> 00:05:10,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I will see if Alicia has anything to say, otherwise we could turn it over to NS Associates to give a presentation of the changes and then the exciting new interactive mapping tool.

46
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:16,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Emily.

47
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:18,468
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

48
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll hand it over to Emily Ennis with Ennis Associates.

49
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:23,372
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

50
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:24,913
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

51
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,734
[SPEAKER_21]: Delighted, as always, to be here tonight.

52
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:37,402
[SPEAKER_21]: I am actually going to turn it over to Paolo Ramos-Martinez for the presentation and also Jimmy Rocha for the explanation of the mapping tools.

53
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:42,866
[SPEAKER_21]: And we look forward to answering any questions the board may have after the presentations.

54
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Good afternoon, everyone, Vice President, if I may.

55
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:55,096
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to share my screen.

56
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:59,379
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to talk about the presentation that we have for you today.

57
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:05,365
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a lot of information, so I'm going to do my best.

58
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:14,913
[SPEAKER_19]: We always have an instructor or presentation to show what we are doing in case anybody new to the process is viewing this.

59
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:31,461
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are going to start with just a tiny introduction of what we are doing, our timeline in the very different comedies that we are looking and seeing to go through this.

60
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:35,874
[SPEAKER_19]: zoning process until it is approved.

61
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:56,262
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to let everyone know that this is not, right now we are not going to vote on it, but, or the members are not going to vote on it, but also there is going to be a continuous process that have other opportunities for you to comment and give us your opinion.

62
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:59,163
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to start the presentation

63
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:36,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry one second I wanted to share the PDF which is easier

64
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:53,102
[SPEAKER_19]: the person we sent is hiding the pdf now it's here okay

65
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:58,105
[SPEAKER_19]: Is everybody seeing my screen?

66
00:07:58,865 --> 00:07:59,646
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, perfect.

67
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:05,070
[SPEAKER_19]: So, as I said, we are going to see that introduction.

68
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,051
[SPEAKER_19]: What are we doing?

69
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:06,871
[SPEAKER_19]: Why are we here?

70
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:14,998
[SPEAKER_19]: A little bit of that process timeline, different opportunities for the public to comment, and then we are going into the residential districts.

71
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:22,864
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to see the map proposal, the dimension standards, table of uses, and any definition that we want to add.

72
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,098
[SPEAKER_19]: So why are we here?

73
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:45,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry for the people that are usually seeing this, they are seeing this every time, but just for the new, if there is anyone new to the process, we are taking the different principles that were identified in the different plans that were done in the last years by the city.

74
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:49,108
[SPEAKER_19]: There is the comprehensive plan that was released in January 2023,

75
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:54,411
[SPEAKER_19]: We are also looking into the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.

76
00:08:55,031 --> 00:09:18,727
[SPEAKER_19]: The first part, it's been already more than a year that we are working on this process, and the first part was to address what were all these principles, and some of them are the ones that you see there, and how we could include these new principles into your existing, into your zoning.

77
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:37,319
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are looking into the existing situation in your city, into the existing zoning, what are the problems or what can we do to address the problems, and then introducing all those principles that were identified in these plans.

78
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,472
[SPEAKER_19]: In the comprehensive plan, there was this vision plan.

79
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:52,915
[SPEAKER_19]: We're using this to go through all the different areas and all the different zones in your city to look at the different districts.

80
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:59,058
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're looking at the corridors, we're looking at the squares, at the institutional districts.

81
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:04,800
[SPEAKER_19]: And right now we are looking in the city board, we're looking into the residential districts.

82
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,622
[SPEAKER_19]: So all the existing in your current zoning residential districts,

83
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:17,513
[SPEAKER_19]: We studied them and we are changing into the proposal that you're going to see.

84
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,384
[SPEAKER_19]: So, this is the timeline now.

85
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:31,228
[SPEAKER_19]: The different ways that we propose a topic, it goes first to the planning and permitting committee meeting.

86
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:37,711
[SPEAKER_19]: So, every planning and permitting committee meeting, you're going to see us and we're going to talk about different topics.

87
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:41,733
[SPEAKER_19]: These are all the meetings that we have done from March.

88
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:46,815
[SPEAKER_19]: We have done other previous meetings, but from March, we started the commercial

89
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:48,296
[SPEAKER_19]: districts.

90
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:52,977
[SPEAKER_19]: So in the planning and permitting committee meeting, we're looking at the commercial.

91
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:54,938
[SPEAKER_19]: We already did the residential.

92
00:10:55,938 --> 00:11:01,479
[SPEAKER_19]: After presenting a topic in the planning and permitting committee meeting, we go, it gets referred to the city board.

93
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,080
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's what we are doing today.

94
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,801
[SPEAKER_19]: The residential districts were referred to the city board by the city council.

95
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:13,126
[SPEAKER_19]: And we are also looking for public opinions.

96
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:22,898
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it will also add those public Q&As where you can also come and share your opinions.

97
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:30,049
[SPEAKER_19]: So today, the City Board, we are here, May 7th, we are going to do the residential districts.

98
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:45,860
[SPEAKER_19]: We are not voting today, so we will be talking again on May 21st about the residential districts and hopefully we can have a vote then to be sent back and referred to the City Council to finally be approved.

99
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:50,924
[SPEAKER_19]: Tomorrow we're going to have a public Q&A.

100
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,526
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be about squares and ADUs.

101
00:11:53,987 --> 00:12:02,515
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyone that is interested in those topics in Medford Square and West Medford Square, please, very welcome to join.

102
00:12:05,513 --> 00:12:11,335
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are all the different non-residential districts that we are still looking at.

103
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:18,016
[SPEAKER_19]: We did two of the corridors, which is the Salem Street and the Mystic Avenue, those were already approved.

104
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:26,699
[SPEAKER_19]: We are looking at the squares and next time we will look into the institutional Medford hubs and the other corridors.

105
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:37,323
[SPEAKER_19]: In order to do the residential proposal, we have done extensive analysis on your existing conditions.

106
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:46,010
[SPEAKER_19]: So, this, for example, is the map for the existing residential building types, lot dimensions, frontages.

107
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:50,493
[SPEAKER_19]: This will help us to understand and have a proposal for the

108
00:12:51,033 --> 00:13:03,470
[SPEAKER_19]: dimensional standards that goes with each of the districts, heights, historic inventories, your transit and transportation map.

109
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:06,695
[SPEAKER_19]: This is very interesting and very important.

110
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:07,195
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't

111
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:17,285
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't know that there were so many private ways in Medford, especially where you're going to see it is very much in the north of the river.

112
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:23,912
[SPEAKER_19]: This will have an impact for the density and how much density we can have in these areas.

113
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:29,954
[SPEAKER_19]: So, what are the considerations that we have in order to make our proposal?

114
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:35,135
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it's mainly the proximity to highly frequent and efficient public transit.

115
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,095
[SPEAKER_19]: This is important.

116
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,576
[SPEAKER_19]: Where do we want to have more density?

117
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:49,879
[SPEAKER_19]: Proximity to services, to commercial areas where we have grocery stores, cafes, then proximity to higher job density areas.

118
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,960
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the map that you see on the right.

119
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:56,769
[SPEAKER_19]: We prefer to have density in public ways than in private ways.

120
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,392
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the map that you just saw.

121
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:06,259
[SPEAKER_19]: How many street connections that you will see in the interactive tool that my colleague Jimmy will show later on.

122
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:10,324
[SPEAKER_19]: But the more street connections your lot has,

123
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:13,845
[SPEAKER_19]: the easier it is to get to that lot.

124
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:26,748
[SPEAKER_19]: That means, for example, a dead end way, it's not so good to have a lot of density, while another one that has many connections will be more interesting to add that density.

125
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:32,750
[SPEAKER_19]: Lot sizes and topography are also important, but it's a little bit more secondary.

126
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:41,989
[SPEAKER_19]: existing residential types, what we already have there, and then how can we make transitions between low, medium, and high density areas.

127
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:56,279
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to right now give, I'm going to stop sharing, I'm going to ask Jimmy to present the map, and this is what you will see once you get into

128
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:59,103
[SPEAKER_19]: the interactive map.

129
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:00,606
[SPEAKER_19]: You will see the map.

130
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:04,894
[SPEAKER_19]: You can have here an area to find to type your address.

131
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:10,625
[SPEAKER_19]: Once you click on your lot, you're going to see this area here where you have the information.

132
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:12,887
[SPEAKER_19]: I will let Jimmy explain that better.

133
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:24,394
[SPEAKER_19]: And then on the upper part, on the right corner, you have different buttons with the layers and legend and other explanations.

134
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:26,795
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to stop share.

135
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:29,997
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just going to give time to...

136
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:39,319
[SPEAKER_19]: I will place the link in the chat so that everybody can access.

137
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,480
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the QR.

138
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,080
[SPEAKER_19]: From this QR code, you can access to the interactive map.

139
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:53,282
[SPEAKER_19]: Now it's easier if you access with your computer instead of your phone because it's a lot of information, but also it's possible.

140
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:58,803
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to stop sharing and I'm going to pass it on to Jimmy.

141
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:02,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Paola.

142
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:04,810
[SPEAKER_19]: The link is already on the chat.

143
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:09,136
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Paola.

144
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,259
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go ahead and share my screen.

145
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:18,467
[SPEAKER_17]: and show you what the map looks like when it's functioning, and once you scan that QR code.

146
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:25,190
[SPEAKER_17]: So as Paola said, you can scan the QR code and it'll populate on your phone, or you can access it via the desktop.

147
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,470
[SPEAKER_17]: Either work just fine.

148
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:34,293
[SPEAKER_17]: The phone just is a little bit smaller, so things would be in different places, but the map still functions either way.

149
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:40,254
[SPEAKER_17]: So as you scan that QR code or click on the link, you're opened by this greeting page.

150
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:46,301
[SPEAKER_17]: And this just gives you a little more information about the project, when the data was last updated.

151
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,724
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's just a splash screen.

152
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,567
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll go ahead and enter this map application here.

153
00:16:52,468 --> 00:17:00,010
[SPEAKER_17]: So once we load this map application, you see Medford is populated and I'll walk you through all the different components of this map.

154
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,212
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to start in the very top left, right hand side of the screen.

155
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:07,372
[SPEAKER_17]: First, you have your map layers.

156
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:17,835
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's quite a lot of data here, but you can toggle these on and off to view the layers that are related to the project so far.

157
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:26,459
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have the approved zoning districts for Misty Gap Corridor District and Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor.

158
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:33,603
[SPEAKER_17]: We have proposed zoning districts as Paola will go over later in the presentation.

159
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:38,546
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Medford's existing zoning districts.

160
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:45,790
[SPEAKER_17]: We have those lot dimensions Paola touched upon earlier for frontage, building setback,

161
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:48,823
[SPEAKER_17]: and lot size.

162
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:53,748
[SPEAKER_17]: And these are measurements of the existing parcel's conditions.

163
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Next we have the use description by lot.

164
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:04,097
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a lot going on here, but there's a legend right here showing you what each color means.

165
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:11,825
[SPEAKER_17]: And moving forward for the map layers, the next we have building age by decades built.

166
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:16,563
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we have average slope by lot.

167
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,744
[SPEAKER_17]: This was an interesting analysis.

168
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:26,927
[SPEAKER_17]: We did this to show where there is steeper slopes throughout Medford.

169
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:37,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is accompanied by the slope tile service by MassGIS, where you can actually look and see the slope.

170
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:43,153
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the slope average by lot is just the average slope on each lot.

171
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:48,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Next, we have the number of street connections by lot.

172
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,771
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, Paola touched on this a little bit.

173
00:18:50,791 --> 00:19:03,522
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you zoom out and look at it as a city as a whole, you see these main corridors have quite a lot of, have a darker color, which means they have more street connections.

174
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:10,067
[SPEAKER_17]: Whereas if you go to a dead end, for example, this one doesn't have as many street connections.

175
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,749
[SPEAKER_17]: It's only has one street connection.

176
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:21,843
[SPEAKER_17]: And finally, for the map, we have road types.

177
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:28,248
[SPEAKER_17]: So the blue for road types represent public rights of way, where the green represents private rights of way.

178
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:38,315
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, just to go over the layers, if you toggle these layers on, you can click on the legend and see exactly what they mean in the legend.

179
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,496
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the same if you have multiple layers toggled on in the map.

180
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:57,886
[SPEAKER_17]: The next is just the base map, so you can change the base map to see what's underneath these layers, and you can change it to whatever your preference is, but I'll stick with human geography for now.

181
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:13,158
[SPEAKER_17]: This little information button just gives you some more information on how to use the map, the project link for Medford City website, and where the credits are, how we collected this data, and how we did the analysis.

182
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:16,068
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the last one is just to share.

183
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:20,711
[SPEAKER_17]: You can share this a variety of different ways, but here's the link for that.

184
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:23,834
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the share button.

185
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:26,596
[SPEAKER_17]: So to use this map, I'll walk you through an example.

186
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:35,081
[SPEAKER_17]: So as an example, on the left-hand side of my screen, you see find address or place.

187
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:39,144
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just gonna type in my address for an example.

188
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:42,487
[SPEAKER_17]: So I live on 16 Fells Avenue.

189
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:46,505
[SPEAKER_17]: the map will load to your address that you type.

190
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,706
[SPEAKER_17]: And once you click on that, you're going to get a lot of information in the pop-up on the left-hand screen.

191
00:20:53,087 --> 00:21:12,450
[SPEAKER_17]: So starting from top to bottom, we have the lot characteristics, when it was built, what the existing use is, what the existing zoning is, and what the proposed zoning, or if the lot has already been approved, such as Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District or Mississauga, that it will say approved zoning district.

192
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:18,507
[SPEAKER_17]: And here are the existing lot dimensions I was talking about, such as frontage, setback, lot size.

193
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:21,508
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have building height and building coverage.

194
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:26,810
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is what's existing for Medford's table of dimensions.

195
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,871
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is what we propose.

196
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:41,176
[SPEAKER_17]: So these will constantly being, these aren't constantly being changes, but they're being updated every time we get updates from Paola with the city.

197
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:43,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Next is the slope.

198
00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:46,620
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just the average, the median, and the minimum per the lot.

199
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,304
[SPEAKER_17]: And then down here, it just describes how many connections this street has to other streets.

200
00:21:52,824 --> 00:21:55,166
[SPEAKER_17]: You can see Fells Ave has 12 connections.

201
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:59,249
[SPEAKER_17]: It's listed as a public road in Medford's website.

202
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's just some more information there.

203
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:04,973
[SPEAKER_17]: You can click that link and it'll bring you to that page.

204
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:13,898
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the last thing is, the more information about the project, you can click there and it'll bring you to Medford's page about this zoning project.

205
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,201
[SPEAKER_17]: A little bit more about the map.

206
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:21,262
[SPEAKER_17]: To work it, you can click the home screen.

207
00:22:21,282 --> 00:22:23,683
[SPEAKER_17]: That'll bring you to the original layout of the map.

208
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:26,725
[SPEAKER_17]: You can pan to your most recent extent.

209
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:32,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Or you can pan back to the other recent extent.

210
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:33,989
[SPEAKER_17]: You can find your location.

211
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,812
[SPEAKER_17]: This didn't do a great job, but you can find your location there.

212
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:46,477
[SPEAKER_17]: And then to get a little more interactive with the map, I just wanted to show you that that's how the map, the basic map works.

213
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:50,279
[SPEAKER_17]: You can also do some filters with this map.

214
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,002
[SPEAKER_17]: And these filters, they run off of each other.

215
00:22:55,082 --> 00:23:04,087
[SPEAKER_17]: So every filter you include or you toggle on and off, they filter the data down to that specific thing you're searching for.

216
00:23:05,036 --> 00:23:07,358
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll do a filter for an example.

217
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,683
[SPEAKER_17]: I will populate the proposed zoning districts.

218
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:16,766
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm gonna go down to the proposed zoning district filter.

219
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,450
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to filter for West Medford.

220
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:30,058
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I want to filter for mixed use 2A for what's proposed.

221
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:38,485
[SPEAKER_17]: So this just shows you the layers or the parcels that are proposed for West Medford in Mixed Use 2A.

222
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:48,351
[SPEAKER_17]: I can also toggle on other layers and it still keeps the filter, but it allows you to view different sets of data.

223
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:54,715
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you want to see building age or use descriptions for these parcels, you can do it that way as well.

224
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,436
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the filter.

225
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:58,796
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a little bit more advanced.

226
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,237
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't have to do it that way.

227
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:11,701
[SPEAKER_17]: But I recommend, you know, finding your address or finding a location that you're familiar with and just clicking on a parcel and playing around with it and seeing what you can see.

228
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:13,081
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

229
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:15,342
[SPEAKER_17]: If there are any questions, I can answer them now as well.

230
00:24:20,364 --> 00:24:21,024
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Jimmy.

231
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:23,565
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

232
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:24,385
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, Peter.

233
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:29,444
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was just gonna... I was just gonna... Brad, you're done.

234
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:32,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Paula, do you guys have anything else to add?

235
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:44,409
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, we will go through the different districts and explaining the new proposal and the recommendations, if that is okay.

236
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:45,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that would be great.

237
00:24:45,729 --> 00:24:45,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

238
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to make sure.

239
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

240
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:52,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Move on if you were done or not cut you off if you aren't.

241
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:55,835
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

242
00:24:55,855 --> 00:25:04,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Then I'm going to, with your permission, share again the presentation and continue where we left it.

243
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,568
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're going to talk about now the residential districts.

244
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:14,034
[SPEAKER_19]: That tool, it's public, it's for everyone to use whenever you want it.

245
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:18,999
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be being updated as soon as we go through the process.

246
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:25,304
[SPEAKER_19]: And then whatever is going to be approved, then it will pop up in the approved section.

247
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:28,045
[SPEAKER_19]: So take your time.

248
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:39,210
[SPEAKER_19]: It can have some complexity, but just to get the information that you want, it's a lot easier than trying to zoom in.

249
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:51,613
[SPEAKER_19]: in a map, so hopefully this makes it easy for everyone to look at what they have, where are they, their current zoning, what is being proposed, etc.

250
00:25:53,774 --> 00:26:05,577
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is the plan that was recommended from the City Council to the City Board for the residential districts, and this was presented in April 2nd, if I remember correctly, to the City Board.

251
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:15,858
[SPEAKER_19]: We heard a lot of comments about different ways of densifying and trying to reach that higher densification.

252
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,722
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've listening, we've gone through the comments and we have a new proposal.

253
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:31,426
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is the new plan.

254
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:32,646
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the new proposal.

255
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:36,247
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm going to go area by area.

256
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:43,208
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of the biggest comments that we had and that was very repeated was higher density.

257
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:51,010
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was in certain areas where we had the T stations and the commuter rail.

258
00:26:53,150 --> 00:27:00,515
[SPEAKER_19]: It was asked to have a higher area, so to extend it instead of the one fourth, the quarter of a mile.

259
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:11,222
[SPEAKER_19]: to extend that density up to half a mile so it wasn't too much pressure on those areas as we've seen before.

260
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:13,223
[SPEAKER_19]: So this was the before map.

261
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:24,490
[SPEAKER_19]: We had UR1 in this more quarter of a mile from the T stations and was asked if that could be expanded up to the half a mile.

262
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,911
[SPEAKER_19]: and that's what we have in here.

263
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:34,536
[SPEAKER_19]: There was also near the commuter rail, it was asked to be a little bit higher density.

264
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:46,564
[SPEAKER_19]: We had NR3 all the area and right now we are doing UR1 for that quarter of a mile and then NR3 in the biggest half a mile.

265
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:52,384
[SPEAKER_19]: We are taking in consideration all the private lots, all the private ways that we've seen.

266
00:27:52,405 --> 00:28:00,527
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why you will see these kind of down zone areas, as for example in here.

267
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:06,729
[SPEAKER_19]: All these dead-end private ways are in UR2, the same as in here.

268
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:25,284
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when we are out of that half a mile, we see that going down to NR1 and having everywhere where we have some bus areas or those high street connectivities, we try to densify a little bit higher.

269
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:30,951
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe I should have said the districts first, so I'm going to name them first.

270
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:38,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Neighbourhood Residential 1, Neighbourhood Residential 2, Neighbourhood Residential 3, Urban Residential 1 and Urban Residential 2.

271
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:45,064
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are the different residential districts.

272
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:51,371
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going from the lowest NR1 to the highest density Urban Residential 2.

273
00:28:53,710 --> 00:29:00,037
[SPEAKER_19]: You will see it later on what is on each of these districts, so that's why I don't want to do it now.

274
00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:05,322
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to know exactly or to tell exactly what are those changes from the previous to now.

275
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:09,626
[SPEAKER_19]: It was asked if we could convert all the NR1s in NR2s.

276
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,451
[SPEAKER_19]: Not everyone, but some people ask for this.

277
00:29:15,692 --> 00:29:29,459
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we have so many private ways in the northern area, we do not have commercial services as we have in other areas like south of Medford or near the corridors or near the squares.

278
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,101
[SPEAKER_19]: we don't have jobs in these areas.

279
00:29:39,302 --> 00:29:45,163
[SPEAKER_19]: So we try to densify the areas that have all these characteristics.

280
00:29:46,423 --> 00:29:49,764
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have left NR1 still in here.

281
00:29:49,784 --> 00:29:55,965
[SPEAKER_19]: It is true that with the ADUs that we will see later on how that affects

282
00:29:56,699 --> 00:30:01,022
[SPEAKER_19]: we can go to a higher density in also NR1 and NR2.

283
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:05,325
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to go through each of these areas.

284
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:13,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Also good to remember, we were asked several times about the mixed use districts last time that we presented this.

285
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:17,233
[SPEAKER_19]: As you see in here, we have a lot of white areas.

286
00:30:17,653 --> 00:30:18,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are because our

287
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,337
[SPEAKER_19]: let's say, not residential districts, right, where we have the corridors, where we have the squares.

288
00:30:26,978 --> 00:30:37,132
[SPEAKER_19]: So we wanted to bring one map with all of them so that we also understand that these areas, the corridors and the squares,

289
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:44,115
[SPEAKER_19]: are going to be the ones that are the highest densities, where we have those commercial, those services.

290
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:54,219
[SPEAKER_19]: And here's where we have the higher buildings and the higher densities.

291
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,200
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we are going to talk about now, it's not about mixed

292
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:10,787
[SPEAKER_19]: areas, not about commercial, not about the high-density residential, but about all those residential districts that are outside these mixed commercial, institutional and special districts.

293
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,688
[SPEAKER_19]: We can start with NR1.

294
00:31:16,189 --> 00:31:26,732
[SPEAKER_19]: As we can see, those areas that are mainly private waste, as we can see in here, also in the south to the fells and that north Medford.

295
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:31,734
[SPEAKER_19]: These are really a lot of private waste.

296
00:31:31,914 --> 00:31:35,175
[SPEAKER_19]: We are outside the areas of commercial, we don't have those services.

297
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:38,536
[SPEAKER_19]: and we have very little public transit in this area.

298
00:31:38,556 --> 00:31:41,796
[SPEAKER_19]: We mainly don't have a lot of public transit.

299
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,677
[SPEAKER_19]: So in this way, that is why we keep it as NR1.

300
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:47,797
[SPEAKER_19]: What can happen in NR1?

301
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:53,278
[SPEAKER_19]: We could have one unit dwelling, and that's your single family.

302
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,519
[SPEAKER_19]: We allow historic conversion.

303
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,059
[SPEAKER_19]: I will explain that in just a second.

304
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:02,540
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have the protected ADUs, the accessory dwelling unit.

305
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,651
[SPEAKER_19]: these are by right, then by special permit you could add an extra ADU.

306
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:18,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Also the ADU, we will have it just a little conversation after we go through the residential neighborhoods, but just so you know that here we have the protected ADU.

307
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:20,954
[SPEAKER_19]: So what is the historic conversion?

308
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:25,355
[SPEAKER_19]: Historic conversion is any large house that

309
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,742
[SPEAKER_19]: is at least 75 years old.

310
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:34,867
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't have to be registered, it doesn't have to be any official name of the historic.

311
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:40,173
[SPEAKER_19]: It just has to be older than 75 years old.

312
00:32:40,753 --> 00:32:49,522
[SPEAKER_19]: In that case, you can do historic conversion and that means that a large house that has only single family at this

313
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:54,691
[SPEAKER_19]: moment, it can be converted and be done as multifamily.

314
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:59,399
[SPEAKER_19]: At this point, this is something that we changed.

315
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:00,680
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not about

316
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,451
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't give a maximum of units in here.

317
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:10,433
[SPEAKER_19]: It's more about what the lot, the conditions of the lot and the house allows.

318
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:20,357
[SPEAKER_19]: And the minimum and how to understand how many you could have is taking the cross floor area, so the square footage of your house.

319
00:33:22,858 --> 00:33:25,500
[SPEAKER_19]: and then dividing that by 900 square foot.

320
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:30,323
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever the number is going to be the maximum units that you can have.

321
00:33:31,624 --> 00:33:34,566
[SPEAKER_19]: No unit can be less than 900 square foot.

322
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:45,554
[SPEAKER_19]: Now you have other requirements that you need to fulfill, that the lot needs to fulfill with the building coverage, the open space, parking requirements, etc.

323
00:33:46,294 --> 00:33:48,495
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not that with the house, that's it.

324
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:54,519
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to be conforming with the other situations of the lot.

325
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:58,101
[SPEAKER_19]: We will see that a little bit more in depth later on.

326
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:01,162
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, yes, the protected use.

327
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:08,566
[SPEAKER_19]: So as you can see, we could have up to three units or the historic conversion could be even more depending.

328
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:14,169
[SPEAKER_19]: NR2, it's in the

329
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:26,036
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's say the areas that could also have some private ways but are closer to service, commercial and public transit.

330
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:39,363
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why those are what you're seeing in here all along the bus lines, some areas that are already because we already have existing two units

331
00:34:39,923 --> 00:34:48,632
[SPEAKER_19]: or because are near a park or something that it's interesting to have a little bit of higher density in very specific locations.

332
00:34:50,594 --> 00:34:56,140
[SPEAKER_19]: So what can we do there is one unit, two unit history conversion, again, same situation.

333
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,000
[SPEAKER_19]: and then the protected ADU.

334
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,241
[SPEAKER_19]: These are the by right.

335
00:34:59,261 --> 00:35:02,081
[SPEAKER_19]: A special permit ADU could also be allowed.

336
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:20,566
[SPEAKER_19]: So in this case, we would have a minimum of, without taking into account the historic conversion, we would have two units plus one ADU by right or two accessory dwelling units by permit, by special permit.

337
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:37,648
[SPEAKER_19]: Neighbourhood residential three, we are mainly having the eastern part of near Salem Street, all these neighbourhoods, we are not touching those.

338
00:35:37,808 --> 00:35:41,551
[SPEAKER_19]: Those were the ones that were proposed as they were before.

339
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:43,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are kept the same.

340
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:47,095
[SPEAKER_19]: So mainly all the eastern part of Medford didn't change.

341
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:49,477
[SPEAKER_19]: The changes were more on the south.

342
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:51,098
[SPEAKER_19]: and the west.

343
00:35:51,538 --> 00:35:55,420
[SPEAKER_19]: So the NR3 were reduced and they were up zoning.

344
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,182
[SPEAKER_19]: We will see these areas in the urban residential one.

345
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:17,253
[SPEAKER_19]: What we have done is on those areas where we have the public transit or alum public transit or in those higher interconnectivity roads, that's where we have a higher density.

346
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:19,474
[SPEAKER_19]: What can we do here?

347
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:25,477
[SPEAKER_19]: One, two, three dwelling units, townhouse, if they are three, can be done.

348
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:31,500
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we have the historic conversion again, same situation, and protected ADU.

349
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:36,463
[SPEAKER_19]: These are all done by right, can also be by special permit, another ADU.

350
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:40,493
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we go to urban residential one.

351
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:52,221
[SPEAKER_19]: So as we can see, it has increased the area for the urban one, especially in the south Medford and the one quarter of a mile.

352
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,319
[SPEAKER_19]: of that commuter rail.

353
00:36:56,019 --> 00:37:02,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Why a quarter is not as efficient, the commuter rail is not as efficient as a T-stop.

354
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:09,425
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't stop in so many areas, it's not as frequent during weekends.

355
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:11,266
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it is every two hours.

356
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:19,489
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's really not an efficient or high frequency as it is the T-stops.

357
00:37:19,629 --> 00:37:20,990
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why for now is

358
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:31,941
[SPEAKER_19]: reduced to a quarter of a mile, the moment that the T station gets extended or there is a higher frequency, then we could look into extending that.

359
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:35,886
[SPEAKER_19]: But for now, this is the area of extension.

360
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,029
[SPEAKER_19]: And what are we allowing in here?

361
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:54,340
[SPEAKER_19]: We have the two, three dwelling units, the townhouse, historic conversion, multiplex, that is a building typology where it's allowed from four to six unit maximum.

362
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:01,905
[SPEAKER_19]: And then here it does not apply the protected ADUs because we are not allowing in your 1D

363
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:06,768
[SPEAKER_19]: one unit, so you're a single family, it's not allowed in the UR1.

364
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:21,858
[SPEAKER_19]: So the local ADU instead of protected ADU, but the local could be added to the existing one that are already there, the two unit and the three unit and the historic conversion.

365
00:38:22,658 --> 00:38:28,422
[SPEAKER_19]: So here we have up to six units, from two to six units.

366
00:38:30,528 --> 00:38:35,430
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the urban residential 2, I'm so sorry, why in here I don't have it?

367
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,770
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a mistake in this map, so sorry.

368
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:45,353
[SPEAKER_19]: But mainly that is the area that we added, so I'm going to look for, sorry, sorry, sorry.

369
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:51,555
[SPEAKER_19]: So as you can see in this area, this is where we proposed an urban residential 2.

370
00:38:52,675 --> 00:38:57,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we are looking at the other corridors, and that is all the main streets,

371
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:03,429
[SPEAKER_19]: and other corridors that are shared with Somerville.

372
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:09,813
[SPEAKER_19]: These might change for more urban residential.

373
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:26,625
[SPEAKER_19]: So as we said, this is quite a complex study that we are doing, this process, and there is going to be always a little bit of back and forth so that UR2 right now is just very close to that T station, but it could be extended

374
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,464
[SPEAKER_19]: if we see with the study of the corridors that we need that extension.

375
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:35,688
[SPEAKER_19]: But for now, this is where we are adding that urban residential to.

376
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:47,978
[SPEAKER_19]: So whenever we look at Harvard, at the Main Street, et cetera, we will come back for these urban residential to areas.

377
00:39:51,091 --> 00:40:09,639
[SPEAKER_19]: And what is allowed in that UR2 is from three units, so three-unit dwelling, townhouse, historic conversion, multiplex, and then we are adding also that multifamily building, and this is more than six units.

378
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,881
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we have the local ADU for one and two and three units.

379
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:15,742
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the same as UR1.

380
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:28,730
[SPEAKER_19]: So, this is a table to understand what is allowed in every of these districts.

381
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,651
[SPEAKER_19]: We have NR1, 2, 3, UR1 and 2.

382
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:34,232
[SPEAKER_19]: What are the permitted building types?

383
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:35,613
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what we just saw.

384
00:40:36,193 --> 00:40:45,297
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we have these two things and the ADUs will come in the later package with the commercial, with the squares that are already referred to the

385
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:51,893
[SPEAKER_19]: City Board, but we will look at once we have done this.

386
00:40:53,075 --> 00:41:01,547
[SPEAKER_19]: But we have two different AD accessory dwelling units, and one is the protected ADU, and this is protected by Massachusetts law.

387
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:04,150
[SPEAKER_19]: and then the local ADUs.

388
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,191
[SPEAKER_19]: These are not protected.

389
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:12,076
[SPEAKER_19]: The Medford has wanted to add it.

390
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:18,942
[SPEAKER_19]: For NR1, 2, and 3, we have a protected ADUs because we have a single unit dwelling.

391
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:25,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Then for the UR1 and 2, because we don't have that single dwelling unit, we allow the local ADU.

392
00:41:27,595 --> 00:41:40,227
[SPEAKER_19]: Any second ADU has to be by special permit and we allow that in all of these districts, but you need to have the first one so you can add the second one.

393
00:41:41,674 --> 00:41:51,501
[SPEAKER_19]: So the maximum units in NR1 will be the one unit, the protected ADU, and then the local ADU by special permit, so up to three units.

394
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:55,624
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is excluding the historic conversion because it's case by case.

395
00:41:57,705 --> 00:42:03,989
[SPEAKER_19]: The NR2 will be two units, one protected ADU and the one local ADU by special permit.

396
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:08,372
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are four units, two of them being accessory.

397
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:13,575
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the NR3, same three plus two, these are five units.

398
00:42:14,956 --> 00:42:21,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Your one, three units plus another two because we only allow up to the three units.

399
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,822
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't allow it in the other principal buildings.

400
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:38,168
[SPEAKER_19]: and your two the same so five maximum with the ADUs then you have maximum units without the ADUs in your one will be six and your two there is no limit for the units.

401
00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:49,027
[SPEAKER_19]: What are the CITIC recommendations for the draft that was presented on the draft on the 2nd of April?

402
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:52,869
[SPEAKER_19]: There are some modifications for the table of use regulations.

403
00:42:54,149 --> 00:42:56,090
[SPEAKER_19]: These are all the different ones.

404
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:07,394
[SPEAKER_19]: So the A7, that's dormitory fraternity or sorority house, there is not permitted now in, we are recommending not permitted in UR1 and UR2.

405
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:17,374
[SPEAKER_19]: C1, private open recreational uses available to the public will be as a special permit city board in UR1 and UR2.

406
00:43:17,915 --> 00:43:22,338
[SPEAKER_19]: D2, public entertainment or recreation facility not permitted in all districts.

407
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:27,583
[SPEAKER_19]: I1, parking area or garage not accessory to permitted principal use.

408
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:29,483
[SPEAKER_19]: not permitted in NR2.

409
00:43:29,783 --> 00:43:42,266
[SPEAKER_19]: I3 parking area garage accessory to a principal use which is within 500 feet of a conforming principal use but not necessarily in the same district will be permitted in NR3, UR1 and UR2.

410
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:52,069
[SPEAKER_19]: I4 parking area garage accessory to a principal use which is on the same lot as non-conforming principal use not permitted in NR1 and NR2.

411
00:43:53,429 --> 00:44:00,873
[SPEAKER_19]: K1, home occupation, see section 94-3.4 by special permit.

412
00:44:01,613 --> 00:44:08,837
[SPEAKER_19]: It was SP in all districts, we just changed that to the city board in all districts, so CDB in all districts.

413
00:44:09,637 --> 00:44:20,401
[SPEAKER_19]: NK8, the changing is deleting the two subcategories, the less than 4,500 square foot and more than 4,500 square foot.

414
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:24,523
[SPEAKER_19]: The uses does not change.

415
00:44:24,743 --> 00:44:26,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Are the same, believe?

416
00:44:26,824 --> 00:44:29,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, in all of them.

417
00:44:31,366 --> 00:44:36,908
[SPEAKER_19]: The updated section for the table of dimensional requirements, table B, section 94-4.1,

418
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:48,440
[SPEAKER_19]: We want to reflect the following modifications, residential districts, the NR1, NR2, NR3, UR1 and UR2.

419
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:51,866
[SPEAKER_19]: What we are changing is lot area square footage.

420
00:44:52,476 --> 00:45:11,308
[SPEAKER_19]: minimum it's going to be 4000 for all of them frontage minimum nr1 and nr2 was 50 we are changing that to 40 facade build out nr1 and nr2 we are not it's not applicable this we won't apply any

421
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:13,709
[SPEAKER_19]: Facade build-out minimum.

422
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:21,173
[SPEAKER_19]: Residential density, this is units per lot, and we have from minimum to maximum, NR1 is 1.

423
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:25,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Here we don't have the accessory dwelling units, so ADUs do not account for this.

424
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:42,254
[SPEAKER_19]: So nr1 is 1, nr2 from 1 to 2 units, nr3 1 to 3, ur1 2 to 6, ur1 3, and then it's not applicable because there is no maximum established.

425
00:45:43,214 --> 00:45:45,315
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a 2, we changed it into 3.

426
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:54,157
[SPEAKER_19]: And historical conversion, we had a maximum for the different neighborhoods.

427
00:45:54,838 --> 00:46:10,643
[SPEAKER_19]: We had the comment during the public, when we presented this the 2nd of April, where it was suggested if we wouldn't put a limit for the historical conversion.

428
00:46:11,523 --> 00:46:13,463
[SPEAKER_19]: And the truth is that we were already

429
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:29,144
[SPEAKER_19]: studying that possibility and what we want is to give an incentive for those large historic buildings to be preserved and in that case

430
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:44,100
[SPEAKER_19]: If they are too big, for example, to have a limit in NR1 to a 2 unit, then it wouldn't be enough economical feasibility, so it wouldn't make it feasible economically, and that's why we changed it.

431
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:50,826
[SPEAKER_19]: In any case, we will see later that we have some standards for that use, so that not everything can be done.

432
00:46:52,187 --> 00:47:13,354
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we change the explanation of historic conversion, so we have here a 1, so footnote, and so the maximum permissible number of units is determined by dividing the gross floor area of the existing principal structure by 900 square foot.

433
00:47:15,514 --> 00:47:20,858
[SPEAKER_19]: Each unit within the existing building must have a minimum area of 900 square feet.

434
00:47:21,558 --> 00:47:27,102
[SPEAKER_19]: Additions and expansion to the existing building shall not increase the number of units allowed.

435
00:47:27,122 --> 00:47:29,543
[SPEAKER_19]: Those were the changes.

436
00:47:30,444 --> 00:47:36,488
[SPEAKER_19]: Then for the Table of Dimensional Requirements, Table B, we modified the setbacks.

437
00:47:37,548 --> 00:47:44,513
[SPEAKER_19]: It came from that study, those analysis that we've seen and that are available on your interactive map.

438
00:47:45,913 --> 00:47:54,416
[SPEAKER_19]: front setbacks, less to ask, 15 as a minimum, was very difficult.

439
00:47:54,636 --> 00:48:04,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Then we would have a lot of non-conforming lots, so we decreased that to 10 in all of the districts and then in UR2, which is more urban,

440
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:07,100
[SPEAKER_19]: that we reduced to five.

441
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,963
[SPEAKER_19]: The side is going to be all the same, so right now it's all for them five, and the rear is all of them 10.

442
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:20,525
[SPEAKER_19]: This was also changed so that ADUs are more possible.

443
00:48:20,745 --> 00:48:33,671
[SPEAKER_19]: If these are too big, the setbacks will be counted for... These dimensions are taken into account for the ADUs position, so we wanted to

444
00:48:34,731 --> 00:48:36,572
[SPEAKER_19]: make it as balanced as possible.

445
00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:47,075
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we only have in the stormwater landscaping just a note, another footnote for the green score telling where it does apply the green score.

446
00:48:47,335 --> 00:48:53,957
[SPEAKER_19]: And in this case, any parcel that is located within the FEMA National Flood Hazard Layers and any

447
00:48:56,678 --> 00:48:58,618
[SPEAKER_19]: development that requires site plan review.

448
00:48:59,299 --> 00:49:03,339
[SPEAKER_19]: In those cases, the previous surface requirement then does not apply.

449
00:49:03,439 --> 00:49:07,880
[SPEAKER_19]: So as you can see here, we have green score and then previous surface.

450
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:13,302
[SPEAKER_19]: If we have green score, then the previous surface does not apply.

451
00:49:13,322 --> 00:49:18,983
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we don't have green score, then the previous surface requirement would apply.

452
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:32,333
[SPEAKER_19]: We had two definitions, we had some comments and there was some confusion about the private open recreational uses and the public open recreational uses.

453
00:49:32,933 --> 00:49:39,040
[SPEAKER_19]: So, we gave definitions and we are adding it to the section 94.12.0 definitions and this is an outdoor

454
00:49:42,503 --> 00:50:00,482
[SPEAKER_19]: First one, private open recreational uses, an outdoor land area privately owned, designed or designated to be used for community recreation, leagues, exercise, sports, education or similar activities, or an area intended to enhance the enjoyment of natural features or natural beauty.

455
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:15,575
[SPEAKER_19]: These use may include outdoor play fields, athletic fields or courts, other recreation facilities and water features, picnic areas, natural areas, boating facilities, fishing facilities, arboretum and botanic gardens.

456
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:27,531
[SPEAKER_19]: The public open recreational uses an outdoor land area, publicly owned and operated parks, playgrounds, playing fields, and other facilities for active and passive recreation.

457
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:33,380
[SPEAKER_19]: So we wanted to add this one so there were no confusion of what this actually meant.

458
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:37,075
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is the last I promise.

459
00:50:37,115 --> 00:50:43,540
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that it's a lot of information but this you will have to go through it as much as possible until we come back.

460
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:52,248
[SPEAKER_19]: So historic conversion definition is the conversion of an existing structure a minimum of 75 years old.

461
00:50:52,488 --> 00:50:57,433
[SPEAKER_19]: In the previous draft, we have 70 so we change that to be aligned with the building.

462
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:01,095
[SPEAKER_19]: Building code.

463
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:11,298
[SPEAKER_19]: Originally designated for one unit, used to a two-unit or multi-unit dwelling with no change to the exterior of the structure.

464
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:17,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Each unit has an independent entrance directly from the outside the building or through a common vestibule.

465
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:25,003
[SPEAKER_19]: And we are adding, so this part is all new in the draft, historic conversion use standards.

466
00:51:25,263 --> 00:51:26,684
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we have several.

467
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:43,551
[SPEAKER_19]: No new dwelling unit created by the conversion of an existing dwelling into a greater number of units or by addition or enlargement of an existing dwelling shall be permitted unless the requirements of minimum lot area

468
00:51:44,131 --> 00:51:54,045
[SPEAKER_19]: maximum building coverage and minimum pervious surface requirements of the district in which the structure is located are satisfied after the conversion or enlargement.

469
00:51:54,526 --> 00:51:57,270
[SPEAKER_19]: So, basically, all this wording to say if this

470
00:52:00,734 --> 00:52:18,143
[SPEAKER_19]: existing structure, when you convert it, you're increasing that non-conformity for any of this or you're entering in non-conformity for the minimum area, the minimum building coverage, the previous surface, etc.

471
00:52:18,624 --> 00:52:20,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you cannot do that conversion.

472
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:22,766
[SPEAKER_19]: It has to continue to

473
00:52:25,427 --> 00:52:30,772
[SPEAKER_19]: be conformed with all the requirements, the dimensional requirements that we see just earlier.

474
00:52:31,153 --> 00:52:41,703
[SPEAKER_19]: So, depending on where that house is, dependent on where the building is located, in which district, it needs to follow those dimensional standards.

475
00:52:43,354 --> 00:52:49,278
[SPEAKER_19]: specific, the required yards shall be those of the structure existing at the time of the conversion.

476
00:52:50,018 --> 00:53:00,464
[SPEAKER_19]: However, any construction occurring outside the limits of the existing structure shall be subject to the yard requirements of the district in which the structure is located.

477
00:53:01,164 --> 00:53:05,326
[SPEAKER_19]: So for the yards, those setbacks that we've seen before,

478
00:53:06,467 --> 00:53:09,728
[SPEAKER_19]: If the existing structure is non-conforming, that is okay.

479
00:53:10,668 --> 00:53:12,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, you can build it.

480
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:33,736
[SPEAKER_19]: The only thing is that anything addition that you're doing, so the emergency exits, etc., anything that you need to do so that is building code approved, if any of those extra have to follow the YARD requirements, the setback requirements.

481
00:53:35,076 --> 00:53:42,619
[SPEAKER_19]: The maximum height shall be the height permitted in the district in which the structure is located or the existing building height, whichever is greater.

482
00:53:43,539 --> 00:53:52,562
[SPEAKER_19]: Open space requirement shall be the required in the district in which the structure is located and office street parking shall be provided as required in section 94-3.2 table of use regulation.

483
00:53:56,323 --> 00:54:06,110
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're changing this historic building into four units, you need to look how many parking requirements do you have.

484
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:16,758
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to see that it fits in the area that you have and that you're not going under the requirement of, for example, previous surface.

485
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:20,541
[SPEAKER_19]: So, all these things need to be taken care of.

486
00:54:25,744 --> 00:54:28,126
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that is all.

487
00:54:28,326 --> 00:54:28,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

488
00:54:29,286 --> 00:54:34,649
[SPEAKER_19]: So now, anything that you need me to repeat, I'm very happy to do.

489
00:54:34,929 --> 00:54:37,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Any questions that you have, happy to answer.

490
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:44,114
[SPEAKER_19]: Any comments that you have, we will absolutely take into consideration.

491
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:46,075
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

492
00:54:47,503 --> 00:54:55,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Paula going to open it up to board discussion, but 1st, I want to recognize Danielle the other hand up.

493
00:54:56,679 --> 00:54:58,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, thank you, Mr. Chair.

494
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:08,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to note that I did get an inquiry through the chat asking for clarification of what is facade build out.

495
00:55:08,864 --> 00:55:10,665
[SPEAKER_06]: We have had a couple of questions from that.

496
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:18,829
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm wondering if you could explain that as I'm sure other people are also wanting to understand what that is.

497
00:55:18,909 --> 00:55:23,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that first appeared as defined term for the Mystic Avenue Corridor District.

498
00:55:24,251 --> 00:55:25,972
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a defined term

499
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,814
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you could explain it, that would be great.

500
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:48,195
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so the facade build-out... I wanted to look... I know that we have different diagrams, so I would like to search for one, but I don't have it right now.

501
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:52,377
[SPEAKER_19]: So the facade build-out is the facade that is on the front lot line.

502
00:55:53,657 --> 00:55:59,760
[SPEAKER_19]: So you have your frontage, your main facade, that is...

503
00:56:03,688 --> 00:56:07,951
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that is abutting the frontage, so that the main street.

504
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:14,817
[SPEAKER_19]: What we are asking is that from your frontage, there is a percentage that needs to be built.

505
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:20,302
[SPEAKER_19]: And because, yes, I will go back to that.

506
00:56:20,662 --> 00:56:29,769
[SPEAKER_19]: First, let's take the comments, because it is very easy to see in a diagram than for me explaining all these different lot lines and frontage, etc.

507
00:56:30,632 --> 00:56:32,947
[SPEAKER_19]: So I will come back to that answer.

508
00:56:32,968 --> 00:56:33,813
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

509
00:56:36,496 --> 00:56:37,797
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you so much, Paola.

510
00:56:38,117 --> 00:56:46,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to open it up to comments from the board before we go into public comments.

511
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:52,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just going to start off, I think, by thanking the team from Innis Associates.

512
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:59,189
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great improvement over, I think, what we saw back in April.

513
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And while

514
00:57:03,552 --> 00:57:18,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I am someone who, by nature, is skeptical of the effectively single-use zoning that is in a lot of Fulton Heights and North Medford.

515
00:57:18,637 --> 00:57:28,300
[SPEAKER_02]: When you explain it in terms of, oh, these are where there are a lot of private ways or streets that you really can't control,

516
00:57:29,557 --> 00:57:41,583
[SPEAKER_02]: what goes on along those streets, it makes sense that you would not be necessarily comfortable putting a higher density there, at least right now.

517
00:57:41,603 --> 00:57:57,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that was much better explained than previously of not so much the, oh, we'll just put this here, but the why it's there and the why you didn't feel comfortable putting more there.

518
00:58:00,882 --> 00:58:12,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, with that, I'd like to open it up to any members of the board who might want to comment on information that we've received, which isn't admittedly a lot.

519
00:58:26,453 --> 00:58:26,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben, you can go ahead.

520
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I switched devices and couldn't unmute myself.

521
00:58:42,023 --> 00:58:43,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I'll be very brief.

522
00:58:43,063 --> 00:58:44,865
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to echo what Peter said.

523
00:58:44,885 --> 00:58:54,812
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's, uh, it's encouraging to see how much of the public feedback was incorporated into these updates and, um, certainly a lot to digest.

524
00:58:54,952 --> 00:59:02,298
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to digest it over the next couple of weeks, but the map tooling and, uh, in particular, kind of the.

525
00:59:03,158 --> 00:59:18,935
[SPEAKER_18]: the balancing of density and increasing the density in certain areas in West Medford and near Tufts and near the public transit systems, I think were necessary updates and really sort of topics that the public was passionate about.

526
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:24,161
[SPEAKER_18]: So overall, my feedback is positive on these changes.

527
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:24,862
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

528
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:35,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Ben.

529
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:42,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, can we make sure Ben is a co-host so he can unmute himself?

530
00:59:43,697 --> 00:59:44,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I just fixed that.

531
00:59:45,178 --> 00:59:45,678
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, great.

532
00:59:45,718 --> 00:59:46,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

533
00:59:56,627 --> 00:59:58,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other comments from board members?

534
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari, Annie?

535
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:22,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Echoing the same, I'm gonna need some time to get into the details, but overall first impressions are that this made a lot of excellent updates, and I'm looking forward to both fully understanding them and seeing if there's additional work to be done, which I'm sure we'll find.

536
01:00:23,756 --> 01:00:25,658
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we're moving in a good direction.

537
01:00:25,738 --> 01:00:27,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for all your hard work.

538
01:00:31,563 --> 01:00:32,604
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

539
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:37,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And Paola, just before I open up to public comment, do you have anything else to add?

540
01:00:39,229 --> 01:00:40,069
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, thank you.

541
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:45,554
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I can share the diagram that I was talking about just a second ago.

542
01:00:45,574 --> 01:00:48,116
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to share my screen.

543
01:00:48,816 --> 01:00:50,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that'd be great.

544
01:00:50,177 --> 01:00:53,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have that explanation before we go into public comment.

545
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:56,702
[SPEAKER_19]: I just need to move it.

546
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:02,933
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you see it?

547
01:01:03,233 --> 01:01:03,353
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

548
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:04,795
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you see the image?

549
01:01:06,356 --> 01:01:06,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

550
01:01:06,816 --> 01:01:18,226
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we have here is a lot, a parcel with, for example, in this case, is this like a single family house.

551
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:24,131
[SPEAKER_19]: The minimum that facade build-out would be this percentage.

552
01:01:24,271 --> 01:01:25,793
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have a lot width.

553
01:01:26,493 --> 01:01:42,209
[SPEAKER_19]: and this is our 100% of the width of the lot and whatever is built in that setback area, that is the minimum percentage of build-out that we require.

554
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:52,879
[SPEAKER_19]: And so for the single, the NR1 and NR2, usually the lots are a little bit bigger and the minimum that we were requiring.

555
01:01:52,899 --> 01:02:01,307
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is still a city, so it's not like a rural area where this percentage will be very, very minimum.

556
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:09,068
[SPEAKER_19]: But it is within this more suburban area.

557
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:14,332
[SPEAKER_19]: We were asking at least 60% of that width of the building to be built.

558
01:02:21,055 --> 01:02:30,159
[SPEAKER_19]: So that this usually what it makes it is more accessible, more walkable, more friendly, more eyes on the street, more active, etc.

559
01:02:30,339 --> 01:02:36,622
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why some of these more, let's say, right now we live it only for the most urban residential districts.

560
01:02:37,762 --> 01:02:48,867
[SPEAKER_19]: You have that minimum, which usually in Medford, almost all of the lots are within this minimums that we require.

561
01:02:49,952 --> 01:03:03,282
[SPEAKER_19]: If there is a garage that is attached, we'll also count towards this minimum percentage or it has to be in this setback area, in this initial area, but that's where we...

562
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:06,992
[SPEAKER_19]: That is what this facade build out is.

563
01:03:07,052 --> 01:03:13,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, it's very easy, but at the same time to explain it, I don't know why it's taking me a little bit of time.

564
01:03:14,014 --> 01:03:18,076
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyway, I hope that with this diagram, it's easier to understand.

565
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:22,417
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just the percentage of that width that we require to be built.

566
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Paola.

567
01:03:32,603 --> 01:03:37,556
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, if we're ready, I'd like to open a public comment.

568
01:03:41,753 --> 01:03:43,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Now open the public comment period.

569
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:47,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature.

570
01:03:47,935 --> 01:03:52,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

571
01:03:53,657 --> 01:03:56,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

572
01:03:56,718 --> 01:04:08,162
[SPEAKER_02]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members as it is not part of the public record.

573
01:04:08,822 --> 01:04:16,385
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, you may message Alicia or Danielle in the chat for assistance.

574
01:04:17,546 --> 01:04:19,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Each participant will have two minutes to speak.

575
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:32,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia will be managing the public comment queue, and as we have been doing the last few meetings, she will have a timer that will indicate to people how long they have to speak remaining.

576
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:42,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you sure, Danielle, anything else you need to add?

577
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:46,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can we just get started?

578
01:04:46,306 --> 01:05:00,116
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want me to call in the names, we'll get started.

579
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:01,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can do that.

580
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:02,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wasn't sure.

581
01:05:02,418 --> 01:05:04,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure what's happening.

582
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done this before.

583
01:05:05,981 --> 01:05:06,481
[SPEAKER_07]: We're good.

584
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:07,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I watch that movie a lot.

585
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:12,171
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone back and forth on whether I call the names or you call the names when you're ready for the next one.

586
01:05:12,652 --> 01:05:15,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And sorry, did you say two minutes per?

587
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:18,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, two minutes per, as usual.

588
01:05:18,474 --> 01:05:20,694
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

589
01:05:21,274 --> 01:05:24,115
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go ahead and call since you're the one timing them out.

590
01:05:24,716 --> 01:05:25,416
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, great.

591
01:05:25,576 --> 01:05:30,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first, sorry, just asked me what my speaking language was.

592
01:05:31,778 --> 01:05:37,260
[SPEAKER_07]: The first speaker is Cheryl R. You have two minutes.

593
01:05:41,118 --> 01:05:43,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

594
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:58,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm disappointed that this past month was taken to build a defense of the NR and NR2 districts not having additional density, that they're near private ways or dead ends so they can't have more density because there's no jobs, they're not near a corridor.

595
01:05:59,325 --> 01:06:01,046
[SPEAKER_08]: These seem like NIMBY excuses.

596
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:04,268
[SPEAKER_08]: The city literally chose what would be corridors.

597
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:09,672
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no special sauce that makes Salem Street area able to handle this much density.

598
01:06:10,093 --> 01:06:11,074
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one bus.

599
01:06:11,794 --> 01:06:17,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Fountain Street is a dead end with limited connections in our neighborhood and it is singled out as you are too.

600
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:20,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does this matter?

601
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:23,037
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like it's a blanket get-out-of-density card.

602
01:06:23,337 --> 01:06:31,800
[SPEAKER_08]: The example given of Fels Ave showed they are being zoned down from needing 35 feet of frontage to needing 40 feet of frontage.

603
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,982
[SPEAKER_08]: If a developer doesn't choose to build on that lot, then they won't.

604
01:06:37,142 --> 01:06:45,785
[SPEAKER_08]: But why are we zoning for NIMBY protectionism, a literal tool created to justify not adding density to chosen neighborhoods?

605
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:57,328
[SPEAKER_08]: It is remarkable the confidence in saying you don't want to bother certain neighborhoods, whole neighborhoods exempt from density because there are some private ways and some dead ends.

606
01:06:57,629 --> 01:07:01,790
[SPEAKER_08]: But miraculously, none of them are in environmental justice neighborhoods.

607
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:12,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Somehow already dense areas with small lots are not reason to not increase density there, but large lots with less density is an excuse to keep density down.

608
01:07:13,275 --> 01:07:14,375
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not make sense.

609
01:07:14,935 --> 01:07:16,216
[SPEAKER_08]: It is just an excuse.

610
01:07:16,716 --> 01:07:18,677
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no density balance.

611
01:07:19,157 --> 01:07:26,200
[SPEAKER_08]: There are those who will preserve neighborhood character and those who will be made more dense at the cost of their quality of life.

612
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:36,203
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny that more density can't be near some areas of the commuter rail because it runs less frequently on weekends, just like buses.

613
01:07:37,105 --> 01:07:41,986
[SPEAKER_08]: but none of the NR1 or NR2 are near the Salem Street area.

614
01:07:42,647 --> 01:07:48,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish more work and study was focused on equitable density and not just protecting some areas from any.

615
01:07:49,849 --> 01:08:00,472
[SPEAKER_08]: If the lot project isn't feasible on a certain lot, the developer won't build, but to exclude something as simple as a two family home and entire swaths of the city is outrageous.

616
01:08:01,132 --> 01:08:01,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

617
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:07,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Cheryl.

618
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:09,972
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

619
01:08:10,492 --> 01:08:15,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave that to you, Alicia, since you've been calling.

620
01:08:15,856 --> 01:08:22,621
[SPEAKER_07]: I do wonder if it's easier for you to decide when to acknowledge the next person versus comment on something.

621
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:25,704
[SPEAKER_07]: But whichever is easier for you.

622
01:08:25,724 --> 01:08:27,085
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, cool.

623
01:08:28,225 --> 01:08:28,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

624
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:31,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll just call the next person.

625
01:08:31,948 --> 01:08:34,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Next person up is Navar.

626
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:43,432
[SPEAKER_15]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

627
01:08:43,732 --> 01:08:46,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, I think this is a big step in the right direction.

628
01:08:46,693 --> 01:08:55,798
[SPEAKER_15]: The broad increase in allowed density in South Medford and Hillside allows for much needed housing without concentrating it in too small an area.

629
01:08:56,678 --> 01:09:04,502
[SPEAKER_15]: The increases in West Medford should indeed help achieve the city's goal of revitalizing the commercial square to the extent that it can.

630
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:11,605
[SPEAKER_15]: I would tend to agree, if we could do a little more to eliminate some of the NR1, that would be good.

631
01:09:14,128 --> 01:09:22,159
[SPEAKER_15]: I also saw earlier brought up about the north side of Fowl's Way, a little more density than just duplexes seems appropriate.

632
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Could easily go NR3 at least.

633
01:09:26,643 --> 01:09:28,004
[SPEAKER_15]: That's for my own neighborhood.

634
01:09:28,024 --> 01:09:30,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, Magoon Square.

635
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:32,668
[SPEAKER_15]: I live in an urban neighborhood.

636
01:09:33,488 --> 01:09:36,010
[SPEAKER_15]: I still think that we can go above three stories.

637
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,111
[SPEAKER_15]: All right?

638
01:09:37,832 --> 01:09:41,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, Abbottick Ball Square, Magoon Square, Winter Hill.

639
01:09:41,514 --> 01:09:43,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are city kind of places.

640
01:09:44,577 --> 01:09:46,038
[SPEAKER_15]: We can go above three stories.

641
01:09:46,058 --> 01:09:46,979
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gonna be okay.

642
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:49,300
[SPEAKER_15]: 100 Winchester Street.

643
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:53,743
[SPEAKER_15]: The city council passed a planned development district.

644
01:09:54,063 --> 01:09:55,064
[SPEAKER_15]: 100 Winchester Street.

645
01:09:55,244 --> 01:09:56,525
[SPEAKER_15]: It allows six stories.

646
01:09:58,106 --> 01:09:59,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, the developer is proposing four.

647
01:10:00,508 --> 01:10:02,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are the kind of range we should be thinking.

648
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:04,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Four, five, or six.

649
01:10:05,271 --> 01:10:11,696
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think we should set the precedent that every part of Medford needs to... If it's residential, it can't be above three.

650
01:10:11,716 --> 01:10:13,557
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we can handle a little bit more height.

651
01:10:15,013 --> 01:10:16,453
[SPEAKER_15]: I wrote an email to you guys earlier.

652
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:23,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, if my neighborhood is going to play the who has more parking game with other neighborhoods, we're going to lose.

653
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:25,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Who has the biggest backyards?

654
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:27,375
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to lose that game.

655
01:10:27,395 --> 01:10:31,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's play the game of let's be a really good urban neighborhood and welcome more people.

656
01:10:31,796 --> 01:10:32,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

657
01:10:32,216 --> 01:10:35,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, William.

658
01:10:37,957 --> 01:10:41,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up I see is Judith Weinstock.

659
01:10:44,447 --> 01:10:45,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, good evening.

660
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:50,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks again to everybody who's been working on this from the city and the consultant group.

661
01:10:51,476 --> 01:10:52,317
[SPEAKER_16]: I really appreciate it.

662
01:10:52,337 --> 01:10:53,939
[SPEAKER_16]: But I actually, I have.

663
01:10:56,075 --> 01:11:07,829
[SPEAKER_16]: some really discreet questions that are related to UR1 neighborhoods that would become UR1 neighborhoods, but that have probably at least 50% of their homes as single family.

664
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:14,416
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've asked the question before, but I'd like to have the answers reiterated at this meeting.

665
01:11:16,078 --> 01:11:21,283
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is probably tailored more to either Danielle Evans or Alicia Hunt.

666
01:11:21,904 --> 01:11:24,987
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did ask this a couple of months ago at one of the meetings.

667
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,388
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to give an example.

668
01:11:26,428 --> 01:11:28,471
[SPEAKER_16]: So my house is over 100 years old.

669
01:11:28,871 --> 01:11:29,872
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a single family.

670
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:33,816
[SPEAKER_16]: It's on what will now become conforming, but was otherwise non-conforming.

671
01:11:34,717 --> 01:11:36,498
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about 4,000 square foot lot.

672
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Two questions.

673
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:39,261
[SPEAKER_16]: One is, if

674
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:59,135
[SPEAKER_16]: If I went ahead and decided I needed to renovate my house extensively, and I got several quotes from construction companies that basically said it's going to run you around $600,000 to make the changes you want to make because your foundation also needs to be replaced.

675
01:12:00,196 --> 01:12:20,675
[SPEAKER_16]: and i got a price from a different construction company that said you know what we can replace your house for six hundred thousand the question of the day is what happens in single family neighborhoods who are now you are one when the single family home is actually more expensive to renovate than it would be to replace

676
01:12:21,095 --> 01:12:30,963
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand that renovation is possible, but the question comes up as what would happen if, in fact, it were indeed either the same price or less expensive to just replace the house.

677
01:12:31,664 --> 01:12:32,645
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one question.

678
01:12:32,685 --> 01:12:45,515
[SPEAKER_16]: The second question is, if I sell my house, which is clearly a single-family house, and someone else buys it, are those same rights extended to that family, assuming it's a family who buys it?

679
01:12:45,976 --> 01:12:48,398
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really a very specific set of questions.

680
01:12:50,885 --> 01:12:51,985
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you, Judith.

681
01:12:52,085 --> 01:13:00,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask Danielle and Alicia if they have any comments on that, because I'll admit I don't know the ins and outs of that.

682
01:13:02,188 --> 01:13:03,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

683
01:13:04,509 --> 01:13:18,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so Chapter 48, Section 6 of Mass General Law is all about the protections for pre-existing nonconforming uses and structures and single family uses in particular.

684
01:13:19,485 --> 01:13:27,450
[SPEAKER_06]: have a lot of protections, singles and twos, to be able to make changes, expand, rebuild.

685
01:13:29,651 --> 01:13:33,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of that is by right with a simple building permit.

686
01:13:34,174 --> 01:13:37,856
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would not have to go to a zoning board.

687
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:43,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you were to increase, say, a non-conforming

688
01:13:45,250 --> 01:14:07,603
[SPEAKER_06]: say non-conforming with setbacks, but hopefully with these changes, you actually would be conforming if they're down to five, but say you needed to expand the house and got closer to the side yard setback, then you could possibly need to go to the zoning board to get a special permit,

689
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:14,351
[SPEAKER_06]: to expand the non-conforming use or non-conforming structure.

690
01:14:14,611 --> 01:14:22,833
[SPEAKER_06]: And the finding that they have to make is, is this substantially more detrimental than the existing non-conforming use?

691
01:14:23,193 --> 01:14:38,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a very low bar and any uses actually would have to do that if they were encroaching on one of the conventional standards like setbacks or lot area.

692
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:52,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And in our ordinance, I'm looking for the section where we talk about it specifically that really goes into detail what you can do that would be by right.

693
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:55,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe you can tear down and build the house.

694
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Emily put the section in the chat for us.

695
01:14:59,071 --> 01:15:01,532
[SPEAKER_07]: It's section 94.5.5.

696
01:15:03,273 --> 01:15:06,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Nonconforming single and two family residential structures.

697
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:17,928
[SPEAKER_07]: While you look at it, I can put that in the chat so that I can put a link to that exact in the chat for other people to then look at later.

698
01:15:18,108 --> 01:15:23,071
[SPEAKER_07]: You can click on the link and save it for later for your review.

699
01:15:26,552 --> 01:15:26,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

700
01:15:28,221 --> 01:15:49,909
[SPEAKER_06]: just to go, yeah, so 94, 5.5, nonconforming single and two family residential structures may be reconstructed, extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a determination by the building commissioner that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure and adds not more than 100% to its gross floor area.

701
01:15:50,609 --> 01:15:51,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could double it.

702
01:15:51,889 --> 01:15:56,331
[SPEAKER_06]: You could tear it down and rebuild it, double the size, and that'd be by right.

703
01:15:58,697 --> 01:16:09,635
[SPEAKER_16]: So the fact that the new district would say no new single family homes, I was under the impression and maybe miss hunt can just confirm or tell me I'm wrong that.

704
01:16:11,387 --> 01:16:20,230
[SPEAKER_16]: that would only then apply for abandoned properties that were more than two years abandoned that you could not rebuild if you already had it.

705
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:32,695
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I sold my house, or if I wanted to knock it down and rebuild it because it was cheaper to do that than just renovate it, you're saying I could do that as long as I met the requirements.

706
01:16:32,815 --> 01:16:37,497
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, and then someone who purchases my house could also do that, correct?

707
01:16:37,917 --> 01:16:43,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because the uses don't care about ownership.

708
01:16:43,743 --> 01:16:51,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be a rental property owned by someone who lives in a different country and could decide to tear it down, rebuild it.

709
01:16:52,673 --> 01:16:56,637
[SPEAKER_16]: So new zoning doesn't prevent me from doing the things that I could do yesterday?

710
01:16:57,793 --> 01:16:57,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

711
01:16:58,494 --> 01:16:58,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

712
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:09,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So pre-existing single and two family homes have a lot of protections under mass general law that the city, we can't depart from that.

713
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:20,112
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I think that's really helpful for people to know, you know, so people don't freak out over the loss of quote, single family homes in their districts.

714
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:28,712
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you, Judith, and thank you, Danielle and Alicia, for that clarification.

715
01:17:28,732 --> 01:17:34,175
[SPEAKER_02]: The next person I see with their hand up is Christopher Dedich.

716
01:17:35,655 --> 01:17:37,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry if I mispronounced that.

717
01:17:37,636 --> 01:17:38,036
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you're good.

718
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:39,257
[SPEAKER_13]: How's it going?

719
01:17:39,537 --> 01:17:41,658
[SPEAKER_13]: My name's Christopher Dedich.

720
01:17:41,778 --> 01:17:42,579
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm 131 Yale Street.

721
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:51,383
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to reiterate I support this new zoning, and I really like what the

722
01:17:53,325 --> 01:17:57,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Couple commenters ago the gentleman about increasing the height.

723
01:17:57,526 --> 01:18:12,951
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that would be good in between four and six would be great And I just have a question about parking is it still the 1.5 even in you are one and you are to 1.5 spaces per unit and and then down to like 1.8 near the T and then

724
01:18:22,182 --> 01:18:23,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think that was my only question.

725
01:18:27,185 --> 01:18:28,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Chris.

726
01:18:29,326 --> 01:18:35,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you want me to just- In the current zoning, it stays as 1.5.

727
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:41,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at the zone, the parking ratios is something that we'll do in a later step.

728
01:18:41,893 --> 01:18:46,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And just, I think that the speaker misspoke, it's 0.8 near the- Yeah.

729
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:47,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

730
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I could tell that that's what he meant because he said go down.

731
01:18:49,877 --> 01:18:51,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

732
01:18:53,067 --> 01:18:53,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

733
01:18:53,487 --> 01:18:57,049
[SPEAKER_07]: So this does not touch any of the parking ratios at all.

734
01:18:57,069 --> 01:18:57,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

735
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's, it doesn't touch it.

736
01:18:59,891 --> 01:19:05,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And for, for people who might want to see the touch, it does not touch any of the parking ratios yet, but thank you.

737
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:08,356
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be something.

738
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:14,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the next person I have up is just one seven, eight, one six.

739
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:16,780
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've been asking me what you're sorry.

740
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:22,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, am I on?

741
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:23,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

742
01:19:24,352 --> 01:19:26,013
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Jim Daugherty.

743
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:28,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at 36 Ellington Street, West Mentioned.

744
01:19:30,315 --> 01:19:32,156
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also like to compliment the work.

745
01:19:32,457 --> 01:19:39,101
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't familiar with the Mystic Ave and other things, but I've caught up to it.

746
01:19:39,181 --> 01:19:41,742
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's been well thought out.

747
01:19:42,082 --> 01:19:45,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And I commend you guys for being so comprehensive.

748
01:19:47,165 --> 01:19:49,727
[SPEAKER_00]: One little tweak that I would suggest

749
01:19:50,447 --> 01:19:57,931
[SPEAKER_00]: and you touched on it earlier, is in relationship to the T-State, the commuter rail station in West Medford.

750
01:19:59,952 --> 01:20:14,900
[SPEAKER_00]: The UR district came down, I guess it would probably be south of Boston Ave to approximately Sharon Street, going from High Street parallel with Boston Ave.

751
01:20:16,221 --> 01:20:18,803
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree that the train

752
01:20:20,263 --> 01:20:32,953
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great if it ran more often on the weekends, but certainly during the week, it gets tremendous amount of use as it's 12 minutes to downtown Boston, probably the quickest way of getting there.

753
01:20:33,374 --> 01:20:35,876
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we do have surface bus.

754
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:39,819
[SPEAKER_00]: service over there, just to finish that thought on the community rail.

755
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:52,510
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like the chicken and the egg, what comes first, you know, more housing, or quickest, you know, more frequent stops so I would like to suggest potentially.

756
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:59,956
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the chicken does in the chicken in this case would be the density that could drive that.

757
01:21:01,237 --> 01:21:06,821
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have surface bus service on high street as well.

758
01:21:07,502 --> 01:21:13,927
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also probably are the closest to the bike path that brings you to our life as well.

759
01:21:15,148 --> 01:21:22,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, as you guys know, is going to be more of a direct route that leads over to where you can pick it up right on the Arlington line.

760
01:21:24,357 --> 01:21:30,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I would say that it's in walking distance to Arlington Center as well.

761
01:21:31,144 --> 01:21:34,609
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have surface bus area on Mass Ave.

762
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:46,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just ask that you consider expanding that, I believe you called it an urban residential one district all the way down to the river.

763
01:21:48,022 --> 01:21:54,424
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially from High Street going along Arlington Street, where it comes back out to Boston Ave.

764
01:21:55,225 --> 01:22:12,071
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very similar, actually, if you look going down towards Tuff along Boston Ave, it's pretty similar to a lot of that area as well, is a little higher density than the N3, I guess, the new one.

765
01:22:13,051 --> 01:22:14,472
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I have.

766
01:22:15,112 --> 01:22:15,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

767
01:22:16,133 --> 01:22:16,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish you luck.

768
01:22:16,453 --> 01:22:16,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

769
01:22:18,145 --> 01:22:20,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for your comments.

770
01:22:21,226 --> 01:22:26,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up that I can see is Gaston Fiore.

771
01:22:31,809 --> 01:22:33,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.

772
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:35,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stickney Road.

773
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:38,179
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a few comments.

774
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:43,103
[SPEAKER_14]: So first, I really like the proposed changes compared to last time.

775
01:22:44,524 --> 01:23:00,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, we want to increase density, but I think the most important factor is to have a breadth of housing options that go from very small units in the dense areas next to transit to much larger units in the areas that are away from transit.

776
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:06,061
[SPEAKER_14]: So I strongly support keeping NR1 as it is with the modified changes.

777
01:23:06,965 --> 01:23:07,106
[SPEAKER_14]: um

778
01:23:10,295 --> 01:23:16,958
[SPEAKER_14]: The first one is that I'm still not sure about the value of the local ADUs on UR1 and UR2.

779
01:23:17,078 --> 01:23:22,240
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the detached and attached ADUs.

780
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:34,045
[SPEAKER_14]: So would it be wiser to restrict local ADUs on UR1 and UR2 just to internal ADUs and then allowing an extra floor?

781
01:23:34,365 --> 01:23:39,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that some of the residents mentioned that as well, to have four rather than three.

782
01:23:40,568 --> 01:23:45,533
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just concerned about the inefficiency of adding more building area horizontally versus vertically.

783
01:23:46,614 --> 01:23:49,677
[SPEAKER_14]: I brought this question before and I don't know whether this was examined.

784
01:23:49,717 --> 01:23:55,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there was a comment at the City Council meeting last week that they were evaluating this in its associates.

785
01:23:55,523 --> 01:23:58,145
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would be interesting to know what the conclusion of that was.

786
01:23:59,026 --> 01:24:04,011
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the last points that I had was related to the historic conversion.

787
01:24:05,627 --> 01:24:25,402
[SPEAKER_14]: So, on the last slide, it talks about addition or enlargement of existing dwellings, but then the definition of historic conversion, apparently the original, so it says here, minimum 75 years old, original design for one unit with no changes to the exterior of the structure.

788
01:24:27,764 --> 01:24:37,953
[SPEAKER_14]: I see this as a contradiction, so if one of the planners could please explain the last slide versus the historic conversion definition, that would be very useful.

789
01:24:37,973 --> 01:24:38,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

790
01:24:39,895 --> 01:24:41,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Gaston.

791
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:41,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on time.

792
01:24:42,317 --> 01:24:52,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Would Emily or Paolo like to comment on any of those with regard to the historic conversion?

793
01:24:55,947 --> 01:24:57,387
[SPEAKER_19]: So, thank you, Gaston.

794
01:24:58,267 --> 01:25:06,650
[SPEAKER_19]: The local ADU question, I'm going to leave it for the next time, because right now we're not talking about local ADUs in this precise topic.

795
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:12,992
[SPEAKER_19]: So, it will come in the later one, so we can look at that in the next one, but we will look at it.

796
01:25:13,932 --> 01:25:28,881
[SPEAKER_19]: And for the historic conversion, so there are going to be some requirements from the building code to abide by the building code to have different egress for the other units.

797
01:25:28,921 --> 01:25:33,264
[SPEAKER_19]: So you usually need two exits, emergency exits.

798
01:25:34,565 --> 01:25:38,387
[SPEAKER_19]: In any case, it's true that we say that there should not be any

799
01:25:41,133 --> 01:25:43,153
[SPEAKER_19]: change to the external structure.

800
01:25:43,634 --> 01:25:48,114
[SPEAKER_19]: So, we are going to look at that and come back in the next meeting if we need to.

801
01:25:48,135 --> 01:26:00,377
[SPEAKER_19]: We will ask our legal counsel, we will look at the language and see if there are any things that should be done better.

802
01:26:00,537 --> 01:26:04,298
[SPEAKER_19]: So, there are any conflicts, but thank you for bringing that up.

803
01:26:06,636 --> 01:26:08,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Paula.

804
01:26:09,517 --> 01:26:10,397
[SPEAKER_07]: If I might, Peter?

805
01:26:10,417 --> 01:26:11,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.

806
01:26:12,097 --> 01:26:22,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that what I've been thinking about is that the difference is we don't want somebody to, the idea is to preserve these older houses, how they look and feel.

807
01:26:24,659 --> 01:26:31,141
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't want them to add an extension and put three more units as a loophole.

808
01:26:31,501 --> 01:26:33,141
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's what we're trying to balance.

809
01:26:33,901 --> 01:26:51,925
[SPEAKER_07]: we think there might need to be some exception for like no, no significant external changes, other than entry and exit doors or other than those needed to make it legally, you know, other than those required by building code, I think there might be some language there that that we're going to be looking for.

810
01:26:51,945 --> 01:26:55,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, so that you you may need to add another door.

811
01:26:56,967 --> 01:27:00,648
[SPEAKER_07]: But you shouldn't add a wing is what we're sort of getting at.

812
01:27:00,928 --> 01:27:02,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And you shouldn't take your

813
01:27:02,748 --> 01:27:08,670
[SPEAKER_07]: house looking structure and make it look like an apartment building and say it was a historic conversion.

814
01:27:11,511 --> 01:27:13,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that clarification, Alicia.

815
01:27:13,332 --> 01:27:18,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up that I see is Jeremy Martin.

816
01:27:21,628 --> 01:27:22,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good evening, everyone.

817
01:27:23,229 --> 01:27:24,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the updates this evening.

818
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:29,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I unfortunately missed the first part of the meeting, but I think I've gotten the flavor of the changes.

819
01:27:29,433 --> 01:27:34,876
[SPEAKER_01]: And I very much appreciate the progress that's been made through these meetings.

820
01:27:35,517 --> 01:27:36,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few comments.

821
01:27:38,718 --> 01:27:48,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little disappointed to see that NR1 still does not allow anything more than single family or historic conversion duplex.

822
01:27:50,045 --> 01:27:56,567
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other reasons, other priorities besides public transit, why we should be allowing density.

823
01:27:57,688 --> 01:28:03,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Living next to some of the most substantial green space in the city should be a draw.

824
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:13,973
[SPEAKER_01]: The city website, when I read about zoning, it says one of the primary goals for neighborhood and urban residential is to

825
01:28:16,674 --> 01:28:21,897
[SPEAKER_01]: allow incremental neighborhood appropriate growth and densification in each area of the city.

826
01:28:22,177 --> 01:28:32,004
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I understand it, the current proposal for NR1 maintains the status quo of single family and ADU and does not actually increase density in those areas.

827
01:28:32,684 --> 01:28:35,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone should be participating in this improvement to our city.

828
01:28:35,886 --> 01:28:40,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And please correct me if that's wrong, but that's how I understand what's being proposed.

829
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:42,911
[SPEAKER_01]: The other comment here is that

830
01:28:43,831 --> 01:28:51,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that the area of UR1, I believe, around the Hillside neighborhood and several other neighborhoods were expanded, and I appreciate that.

831
01:28:51,996 --> 01:28:54,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it reflects the actual conditions.

832
01:28:54,818 --> 01:29:01,422
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like we're still using a walking radius circle to make some decisions about where that

833
01:29:02,632 --> 01:29:03,612
[SPEAKER_01]: change happens.

834
01:29:04,233 --> 01:29:20,339
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you that I see, I live near the T, I see people with Whole Foods bags walking by all the time to go to the T. Those neighborhoods, these neighborhoods south of the river that are a part of these hillside neighborhoods, are just as accessible to the T as others.

835
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:31,043
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's just make this simple and make all of it UR1 or UR2, whatever it needs to be, to make it reasonable and fair for everyone in these communities.

836
01:29:31,263 --> 01:29:31,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

837
01:29:33,895 --> 01:29:36,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Jeremy, for your contributions.

838
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:43,182
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other person with a hand up right now I see is Caitlin, so you can go ahead.

839
01:29:43,202 --> 01:29:53,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, I'm Caitlin Robinson, 31 Everett Street.

840
01:29:55,011 --> 01:29:58,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for all of the work that has taken place on this.

841
01:29:58,314 --> 01:30:00,776
[SPEAKER_11]: I do feel like it is a step in the right direction.

842
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:05,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, like previous speakers, I continue to have some concerns.

843
01:30:06,212 --> 01:30:13,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, for example, the, um, neighborhood residential one, I'm concerned that that still exists.

844
01:30:13,816 --> 01:30:17,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I do feel like we should at minimum have neighborhood residential too.

845
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:27,103
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that the example that we saw from Fells Ave earlier today, where what is currently a two family will now be zoned for like single family.

846
01:30:27,143 --> 01:30:28,203
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's problematic.

847
01:30:28,244 --> 01:30:31,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we should be zoning anything for like

848
01:30:32,129 --> 01:30:34,770
[SPEAKER_11]: only single family allowed, but plus ADUs.

849
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:44,792
[SPEAKER_11]: I also agree with the previous speaker about like the radius around West Medford Square and other transit stops in general.

850
01:30:44,832 --> 01:30:46,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think that 0.5 is too small.

851
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:52,054
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we need to take into consideration as well, like we have an expanding blue bikes network.

852
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:55,555
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, I

853
01:30:56,423 --> 01:31:01,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that it should be limited to like a quarter of a mile around West Medford Square.

854
01:31:01,246 --> 01:31:07,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Another concern that I have is the parking, which I know will be addressed at a later time.

855
01:31:07,451 --> 01:31:20,440
[SPEAKER_11]: But for example, with the historic conversions right now needing to retain those minimum parking standards per unit, that's going to probably result in like large surface parking lots.

856
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,742
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the idea of a historic conversion is that we're trying to like

857
01:31:24,162 --> 01:31:26,405
[SPEAKER_11]: maintain the character or the aesthetic of it.

858
01:31:26,785 --> 01:31:29,608
[SPEAKER_11]: The large surface parking lots don't contribute to that.

859
01:31:30,809 --> 01:31:40,160
[SPEAKER_11]: But I am just overall worried about how parking minimums are going to kind of work against a lot of what's planned here.

860
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:44,264
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do look forward to when those are addressed later in this process.

861
01:31:44,684 --> 01:31:45,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

862
01:31:47,494 --> 01:31:49,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Caitlin.

863
01:31:49,577 --> 01:31:57,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have next up, it seems we have Sharon W. You can go ahead.

864
01:31:58,713 --> 01:32:03,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Sharon Wentworth, 694 Winthrop Street.

865
01:32:04,034 --> 01:32:06,974
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have a question on the special permits.

866
01:32:07,615 --> 01:32:23,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Will that work the same way that zoning does now where you go before the board and the neighbors get notified of what you're planning on doing, the same process?

867
01:32:25,758 --> 01:32:27,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, in my understanding.

868
01:32:28,031 --> 01:32:31,732
[SPEAKER_02]: the special permit process will be the same as it is now.

869
01:32:33,033 --> 01:32:33,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything?

870
01:32:34,393 --> 01:32:41,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Will there be a lot of exceptions to that now going forward?

871
01:32:42,636 --> 01:32:44,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle, if you'd like to clarify.

872
01:32:44,917 --> 01:32:48,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Can she repeat the question about what gets notified?

873
01:32:50,248 --> 01:33:04,513
[SPEAKER_10]: because we in the area so like now if you want to put up a, excuse me a higher fence, all the residents in the area get notified it's put in the paper, and they get to respond.

874
01:33:05,253 --> 01:33:06,434
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a meeting set.

875
01:33:07,574 --> 01:33:08,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so through the chair.

876
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:26,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that requires a special permit or variance or a site plan review that would go before the Community Development Board or the Zoning Board, you would still get the required notifications, which is actually state law.

877
01:33:26,974 --> 01:33:28,416
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can't change that.

878
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,018
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't decide that we're just not going to notify for

879
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:33,411
[SPEAKER_06]: fence variances anymore.

880
01:33:33,471 --> 01:33:34,972
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the law, we'd have to do it.

881
01:33:35,452 --> 01:33:41,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And the radius is also dictated by Mass General Law.

882
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:49,722
[SPEAKER_06]: So some things that are getting changed by right, you wouldn't get a notification.

883
01:33:50,462 --> 01:33:54,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Prior to the ADU law that was passed,

884
01:33:55,118 --> 01:34:00,040
[SPEAKER_06]: A detached ADU would need a special permit, and therefore, there was notification for that.

885
01:34:00,741 --> 01:34:03,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, that would be by right, so there would be no notification.

886
01:34:04,162 --> 01:34:18,268
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there are certain things that if they're by right now, you wouldn't get the notification, but things that are not by right, you still would if you're in a butter or the butter to a butter within a certain radius.

887
01:34:19,309 --> 01:34:21,410
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that falls under special permit?

888
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:36,139
[SPEAKER_06]: special permit variances, site plan review, anything that has a public hearing has to be, has to have notification two weeks in advance to public hearing notices run in the paper.

889
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:41,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's mailings to the abutters and abutters to abutters.

890
01:34:43,322 --> 01:34:43,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

891
01:34:44,263 --> 01:34:44,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

892
01:34:47,655 --> 01:34:49,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Sharon.

893
01:34:50,356 --> 01:34:54,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up would be Elizabeth.

894
01:35:03,382 --> 01:35:06,964
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, can you hear me?

895
01:35:07,184 --> 01:35:09,265
[SPEAKER_02]: You are echoing, but yes.

896
01:35:09,365 --> 01:35:10,245
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, how about now?

897
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:12,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, now you're good.

898
01:35:12,466 --> 01:35:13,206
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, thank you.

899
01:35:13,506 --> 01:35:14,947
[SPEAKER_20]: Elizabeth Bale, 34 Emory Street.

900
01:35:18,033 --> 01:35:26,297
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate the immense amount of work that's going into this, and I think having the interactive tool is going to be helpful.

901
01:35:28,818 --> 01:35:38,022
[SPEAKER_20]: The first thing I wanted to just say is there seems to be a discrepancy between the maps and the table about where a townhouse is allowed.

902
01:35:40,592 --> 01:35:56,147
[SPEAKER_20]: was previously, it seemed like it wasn't allowed in NR3 and it is allowed in UR1, but in some of the slides, it says it's allowed in both of them.

903
01:35:56,267 --> 01:36:03,373
[SPEAKER_20]: So maybe that discrepancy could be tracked down and corrected whichever way it's supposed to be.

904
01:36:05,505 --> 01:36:16,032
[SPEAKER_20]: I also wanted to know on the road type, is there any attention paid to whether streets are one-way or two-way?

905
01:36:16,052 --> 01:36:22,116
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I think that makes a difference in how it should be zoned too.

906
01:36:22,136 --> 01:36:26,119
[SPEAKER_20]: Our street is a short one-way street and

907
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:29,105
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

908
01:36:29,526 --> 01:36:31,367
[SPEAKER_20]: Everyone seems to want more density.

909
01:36:31,407 --> 01:36:38,353
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a couple of dozen people on this call, and I don't know that that's representative of what people are thinking.

910
01:36:38,433 --> 01:36:47,741
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm personally horrified about my area being zoned as UR1 instead of NR3, as it was previously proposed.

911
01:36:48,262 --> 01:36:51,584
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just have to speak up and say I hate it and I'm horrified.

912
01:36:52,665 --> 01:37:08,739
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be, there's just a contradiction between what Alicia just said about historic conversions preserving the character of at least the outside of the house versus letting it look like an apartment building.

913
01:37:08,799 --> 01:37:12,201
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I have a historic house built in 1895 and if there's going to be a

914
01:37:14,203 --> 01:37:22,409
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, four to six story unit next to me and, and all down my street, it's not gonna, you know, look very good later.

915
01:37:22,429 --> 01:37:32,277
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just gonna destroy the character of my particular neighborhood, which I'm very, has a lot of good characteristics in it right now.

916
01:37:37,478 --> 01:37:41,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Elizabeth, for your input.

917
01:37:41,961 --> 01:37:47,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any other participants with their hands up.

918
01:37:48,424 --> 01:37:52,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, Danielle, do we have any emails or chat messages or anything?

919
01:37:55,848 --> 01:38:01,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't gotten anything in chat from anybody else who wanted to speak, but, for example, couldn't raise their hand.

920
01:38:03,254 --> 01:38:08,939
[SPEAKER_07]: There have been some emails that have actually come in during the meeting.

921
01:38:08,959 --> 01:38:13,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just taking a quick look.

922
01:38:14,964 --> 01:38:21,869
[SPEAKER_07]: This one says they watched the presentation tonight and they support the proposal, the updated

923
01:38:22,891 --> 01:38:32,742
[SPEAKER_07]: zoning proposal and that we need more housing in Medford and repeats the please add any additional height between urban areas around the T stops and the major squares.

924
01:38:32,762 --> 01:38:37,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I support the broad density proposed south of this river.

925
01:38:37,427 --> 01:38:43,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was another one.

926
01:38:44,799 --> 01:38:48,281
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, oh, this actually arrived shortly before the meeting.

927
01:38:49,441 --> 01:38:56,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, like the upzoning that they're seeing here, it's too long for me to read all of it on the fly.

928
01:38:56,805 --> 01:39:04,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were several messages that public comments that were put in the board's folders.

929
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:11,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, we got a summary of those from Amanda or Peter, do you want me to just sort of

930
01:39:12,573 --> 01:39:16,157
[SPEAKER_07]: quickly hit that summary of the ones that were in your folders.

931
01:39:17,037 --> 01:39:19,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, if you have the summary available, that would be helpful.

932
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so Amanda sent us a quick one that said six comments came in for this discussion tonight.

933
01:39:26,246 --> 01:39:27,227
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in the packet.

934
01:39:30,815 --> 01:39:55,136
[SPEAKER_07]: favor request so I don't actually have names in this summary so I don't know if any of these are the same people who spoke tonight but in favor of the current proposal request additional heightened density by right in the you are areas around the T stops major quarters and squares requesting expanding opportunity for density for housing and business development so this that so this

935
01:39:56,416 --> 01:39:58,197
[SPEAKER_07]: that is the squares that we're getting to.

936
01:40:00,177 --> 01:40:02,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Supports reducing parking minimums.

937
01:40:02,358 --> 01:40:06,139
[SPEAKER_07]: This latest map is the next comment is this is a great step forward.

938
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:12,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, suggests eliminating or significantly reducing the NR1 zoning.

939
01:40:12,921 --> 01:40:15,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Wants every neighborhood to participate.

940
01:40:15,802 --> 01:40:19,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Zone the Ball Square, Magoon Square, and Winter Hill.

941
01:40:21,464 --> 01:40:22,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Requests more density and height.

942
01:40:25,688 --> 01:40:27,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Favor of the latest zoning map.

943
01:40:27,309 --> 01:40:33,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, basically, these are all in favor of the zoning with comments.

944
01:40:33,851 --> 01:40:36,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Any comments are about more density.

945
01:40:39,252 --> 01:40:43,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one suggests upgrading zoning closest to the new Malden Hospital.

946
01:40:43,694 --> 01:40:45,214
[SPEAKER_07]: The hospital has a bus stop.

947
01:40:48,367 --> 01:40:55,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I just have to say that several of the letters said they were grateful for the outreach process around this effort.

948
01:40:57,274 --> 01:41:01,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you for that, Alicia.

949
01:41:01,858 --> 01:41:08,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like while we were talking, George raised their hand, so I'm going to let them go ahead.

950
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:15,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi there, can you hear me?

951
01:41:15,698 --> 01:41:17,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.

952
01:41:17,779 --> 01:41:24,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, so I'm actually Lori Krieger and I'm on an iPad because I had my hip replaced a week ago, so I'm doing my best.

953
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:33,622
[SPEAKER_12]: The things that my biggest question is, do we have an overarching goal, probably yes, of how many units we want to increase in Medford?

954
01:41:34,022 --> 01:41:36,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it seems like, to me,

955
01:41:36,783 --> 01:41:40,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Wellington Circle, I was driving, or Wellington, the T stop, right?

956
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:58,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I was driving by there and it seems like really low buildings with no density at all and lots of opportunity for adding thousands, if not hundreds of units as compared to my neighborhood, which is Hillside, which would allow for hundreds of people additional, not thousands.

957
01:41:59,154 --> 01:42:05,378
[SPEAKER_12]: So can we add to the mix, like just what is our overarching goal and how can we accomplish that goal?

958
01:42:06,298 --> 01:42:17,141
[SPEAKER_12]: In in that sort of manner in terms of um, I was also reading about how costco is adding apartment buildings above their buildings in california Which is new and interesting.

959
01:42:17,221 --> 01:42:34,807
[SPEAKER_12]: I hadn't heard things like that previously Um, I want to support what jeremy said like there's a lot of places where density can be increased next to the rivers or in like keep the environmental Sound and whole but let more people appreciate it and use their bikes and stuff like that and um

960
01:42:35,467 --> 01:42:37,689
[SPEAKER_12]: those private ways, can we make them public ways?

961
01:42:37,789 --> 01:42:41,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, why do they get to have this kind of proprietary ownership?

962
01:42:41,912 --> 01:42:42,732
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I got.

963
01:42:43,313 --> 01:42:45,795
[SPEAKER_12]: I think more is more, and I really appreciate y'all.

964
01:42:46,195 --> 01:42:46,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care.

965
01:42:46,615 --> 01:42:50,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Lori.

966
01:42:52,700 --> 01:43:03,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, just to hit on the Wellington piece, as someone who lives in the Wellington neighborhood, that is coming down, that is coming down as a different phase, the Wellington Special District, so.

967
01:43:04,944 --> 01:43:05,845
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be working on that.

968
01:43:11,234 --> 01:43:15,721
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I don't see anyone else.

969
01:43:15,741 --> 01:43:19,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think...

970
01:43:22,189 --> 01:43:34,973
[SPEAKER_02]: If it makes sense, I'm going to go ahead and close the public comment and move on to board comment and deliberations for this meeting.

971
01:43:40,115 --> 01:43:43,877
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start with that.

972
01:43:44,297 --> 01:43:44,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to

973
01:43:47,443 --> 01:43:50,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Go through the notes I took from the public comments.

974
01:43:51,844 --> 01:44:10,788
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a general, generally desire for more density, particularly places that were noted were on the center of the line in Ball Square, Magoon Square area, thinking of going more than three stories.

975
01:44:13,366 --> 01:44:33,296
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly the north side of Fellsway in that kind of Bolton Heights, North Medford area, and the areas around the river in West Medford and Hillside, as well as

976
01:44:34,876 --> 01:44:48,921
[SPEAKER_02]: a further radius around T-stations kind of similar to what we heard last time that initially took the EUR1 from a quarter mile to half a mile.

977
01:44:50,902 --> 01:45:00,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And a concern, generally a concern about parking, particularly in regard with historical conversions, although I know that's a later phase in the process.

978
01:45:21,895 --> 01:45:24,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything else they'd like to add on.

979
01:45:31,802 --> 01:45:44,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ask, I think it would be helpful for the staff and the consultants if the board, so the goal would be, the hope would be that at the next meeting, the board might be ready to vote.

980
01:45:45,512 --> 01:45:50,055
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the board is looking for changes to the existing map,

981
01:45:50,867 --> 01:45:54,729
[SPEAKER_07]: They should articulate that so we can provide that for the next meeting.

982
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:58,551
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they want to think about it, that's fine.

983
01:45:58,631 --> 01:46:03,254
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're thinking you want to see something different, this is a good time to tell us.

984
01:46:06,236 --> 01:46:12,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it turns out that you need to think about it, and then to say that at the next meeting, that's your prerogative.

985
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:14,961
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just feel like it's helpful.

986
01:46:17,025 --> 01:46:24,935
[SPEAKER_07]: that if you guys want something different, the consultants won't change it just because the public said they wanted different, they need to know what the board wants.

987
01:46:26,237 --> 01:46:28,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's the board's recommendation and the council.

988
01:46:43,121 --> 01:46:53,770
[SPEAKER_03]: In that case, I would like to see the increased density in the single family and our zoning per public comment and the summary.

989
01:46:58,454 --> 01:47:03,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know there were a lot of other things agreed, but I did not take as good notes as Peter.

990
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:10,785
[SPEAKER_03]: But if anyone else wants to jump in, yes, I think we have some concrete changes I would like to see.

991
01:47:19,368 --> 01:47:22,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I simply agree with what Ari stated.

992
01:47:22,691 --> 01:47:40,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have to really clarify where we can add density and how we're going to do that, which has simply to do with what the board is thinking.

993
01:47:40,308 --> 01:47:44,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

994
01:47:45,677 --> 01:47:48,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to agree with that.

995
01:47:48,318 --> 01:48:10,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should look at where there is NR1 abutting major road corridors, stuff like that, where people could walk to a corridor or walk to a square and see

996
01:48:12,562 --> 01:48:23,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can't get rid of all of the NR1, but if we could make, if we could decrease that area, even if NR2, I mean, that's only, you can add one more unit.

997
01:48:26,432 --> 01:48:38,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I mean, I think the best places to look to see where we can increase density are those places where you're up against a denser zone.

998
01:48:38,675 --> 01:48:54,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think probably in West Medford and Medford Hillside where you have some little pockets of the less dense zoning up against the denser areas around these stations, I'd like to see those.

999
01:48:55,148 --> 01:48:56,009
[SPEAKER_02]: get zoned a little more.

1000
01:48:56,049 --> 01:49:12,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's kind of late in the process for this, but I do think I do tend to agree with the sentiment, particularly for areas along the Somerville line in Ball Square and that area, that we could do more than three stories.

1001
01:49:12,301 --> 01:49:17,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when you're trying to kind of zone the whole city with a few categories, you don't want to

1002
01:49:19,322 --> 01:49:20,882
[SPEAKER_02]: make too many lists.

1003
01:49:20,942 --> 01:49:24,884
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think, I mean, that's a pretty urban area.

1004
01:49:24,904 --> 01:49:34,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think going up to a fourth or fifth story is really going to be that much different from what's there right now.

1005
01:49:35,027 --> 01:49:46,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I think going into just what you said, Peter, where around the West Medford train station, there are natural places where you can go up

1006
01:49:48,757 --> 01:50:02,927
[SPEAKER_09]: a flight or two, and it would look totally natural to the environment, and it would not change the flavor of the area, but it would give people more opportunity of places to live.

1007
01:50:07,070 --> 01:50:07,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

1008
01:50:07,591 --> 01:50:13,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's an area that we should definitely be upzoning much more aggressively.

1009
01:50:14,672 --> 01:50:19,696
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are changes along High Street leading there that are happening right now.

1010
01:50:20,696 --> 01:50:34,206
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just looks so natural to the environment as it's on High Street, on Boston, just in and around the train station.

1011
01:50:34,706 --> 01:50:42,212
[SPEAKER_09]: It's people need... Somebody mentioned from the public that you get on that

1012
01:50:44,343 --> 01:50:46,723
[SPEAKER_09]: and you're in Boston in 12 minutes.

1013
01:50:46,844 --> 01:50:53,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can't drive from Medford Square to West Medford in 12 minutes.

1014
01:50:53,965 --> 01:50:55,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind going to Boston.

1015
01:50:55,605 --> 01:51:02,266
[SPEAKER_09]: And people don't need to spend commuting like it's a part-time job.

1016
01:51:02,666 --> 01:51:07,427
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to really consider quality of life.

1017
01:51:08,367 --> 01:51:13,008
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can have neighborhoods that have historic buildings

1018
01:51:13,687 --> 01:51:16,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in a house that's 124 years old.

1019
01:51:17,409 --> 01:51:31,234
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also have houses near me that have the ability to convert to a couple of apartments, and it wouldn't change the historical nature of the buildings.

1020
01:51:36,074 --> 01:51:43,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that, and I mean, I do think some of that is going to be covered in the corridors and squares zoning that goes through.

1021
01:51:43,798 --> 01:51:46,379
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that is coming through later.

1022
01:51:46,439 --> 01:52:04,007
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think looking at the, and I mean, I do think there were a couple of public comments that talked about the river and talked about those kind of natural areas and that those would be attractive places for people to want to live.

1023
01:52:04,883 --> 01:52:07,104
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should give them more opportunities to do that.

1024
01:52:07,124 --> 01:52:32,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there is, to some extent, from the river to West Medford Square on the north side, and from the river down the Boston Ave corridor towards Tufts on the other, a contiguous neighborhood feel that I think is something we could look at as having a higher density within reason.

1025
01:52:33,777 --> 01:52:40,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, although with the caveat that we'll want to be careful around climate change effects on the river and future flooding.

1026
01:52:40,739 --> 01:52:41,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.

1027
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:47,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is a real, if you think of, sadly, a seaport.

1028
01:52:48,662 --> 01:52:59,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they designed the seaport and forgot originally to put in a fire station and a police station and the fact that that area floods and all kinds of things like that.

1029
01:52:59,645 --> 01:53:03,046
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I think what we're doing in Medford is so amazing.

1030
01:53:03,531 --> 01:53:12,113
[SPEAKER_09]: We're really taking time to really look at all the different aspects of planning an environment.

1031
01:53:13,053 --> 01:53:16,054
[SPEAKER_09]: City planning, that's the heart and soul of city planning.

1032
01:53:19,115 --> 01:53:20,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said.

1033
01:53:22,696 --> 01:53:24,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody have anything else to add?

1034
01:53:26,677 --> 01:53:28,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a logistics question.

1035
01:53:28,437 --> 01:53:28,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1036
01:53:28,797 --> 01:53:30,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ben, if you have, feel free to.

1037
01:53:32,197 --> 01:53:37,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to need a few days at least to kind of really digest this and have time to play around with the tool.

1038
01:53:39,339 --> 01:53:45,140
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the best way to communicate those with the consultants?

1039
01:53:45,200 --> 01:54:00,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I can't communicate it with the whole board because of open meeting laws, but Alicia, can you kind of maybe give the entire board guidance as we dig into the details and go back over the public comment, which I'm looking forward to doing.

1040
01:54:02,512 --> 01:54:17,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that would be good as well, so people can, if we do want to facilitate having something in place on the 21st that we can vote on, I think if the board is able to kind of digest and communicate things onto the team as we find that out.

1041
01:54:18,665 --> 01:54:19,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1042
01:54:19,826 --> 01:54:23,607
[SPEAKER_07]: So, pardon me if I'm going to think out loud a little bit here.

1043
01:54:25,288 --> 01:54:29,630
[SPEAKER_07]: We do want to be careful about open meeting law and the board can't deliberate in private.

1044
01:54:30,191 --> 01:54:40,736
[SPEAKER_07]: However, if at any point, you know, if the board, if there were members of the board who had said, you know, if you had questions in between and you wanted me to clarify something, we can always do that.

1045
01:54:41,476 --> 01:54:51,460
[SPEAKER_07]: We've always said that if you wanted to provide your thoughts to us individually, you can email me and Danielle.

1046
01:54:53,040 --> 01:55:02,124
[SPEAKER_07]: If there were things that you realized after the fact you didn't understand, or you're like, wait, I thought it said this, but now I'm second-guessing myself.

1047
01:55:02,324 --> 01:55:06,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you clarify that for me?

1048
01:55:06,706 --> 01:55:10,147
[SPEAKER_07]: You certainly can send that to us and we can get you clarifications.

1049
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:18,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think that in the end, if you sent us stuff that you wanted to see changed, and then the, the.

1050
01:55:21,225 --> 01:55:35,373
[SPEAKER_07]: so that it could be reflected in the consultant's presentation next time, and then it was presented to the public at the next meeting, I think that would be fine.

1051
01:55:35,473 --> 01:55:45,099
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will say that our goal is to have anything with any changes available to everybody, the board and the public, at least the Friday before the meeting.

1052
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:55,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And part of why we really did not feel that the board could vote tonight was because you only got all of you got this stuff today.

1053
01:55:55,443 --> 01:55:57,363
[SPEAKER_07]: There might have been some of it came out yesterday.

1054
01:55:57,383 --> 01:56:01,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Danielle sent it, so I wasn't not positive on the timing.

1055
01:56:02,745 --> 01:56:07,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And that I mean, that really is it's not was not sufficient time for anybody to adjust stuff.

1056
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:18,274
[SPEAKER_07]: We have been slammed with trying to do so many topics at once, which is why it's been taking so long.

1057
01:56:19,821 --> 01:56:25,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I do think you could email me and Danielle individually with your thoughts and concerns.

1058
01:56:27,087 --> 01:56:33,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And then anything that results in a change could get reflected out in the next meeting.

1059
01:56:34,012 --> 01:56:35,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds reasonable.

1060
01:56:36,394 --> 01:56:37,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, totally reasonable.

1061
01:56:37,916 --> 01:56:43,140
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we run into any difficulty using the tool, we can send you a question.

1062
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried this.

1063
01:56:45,066 --> 01:56:47,627
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I can't make that work.

1064
01:56:48,488 --> 01:57:02,275
[SPEAKER_09]: And whether we got it today or yesterday, it's so much information, even if you need a week at least to really properly digest it, as Ari had said.

1065
01:57:02,895 --> 01:57:05,797
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we have a good direction now.

1066
01:57:05,957 --> 01:57:10,439
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have any of those kinds of questions, we will certainly send them to you.

1067
01:57:16,124 --> 01:57:17,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that sounds good.

1068
01:57:17,465 --> 01:57:20,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone on the board have anything else?

1069
01:57:20,989 --> 01:57:29,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I would be looking for a motion to continue public hearing to date certain being May 21.

1070
01:57:31,489 --> 01:57:36,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just say something before members of the public start logging off, because they might do that after you vote.

1071
01:57:36,292 --> 01:57:45,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want everybody to know that there's a public meeting tomorrow night about the West Medford Square and Medford Square in the ADUs.

1072
01:57:45,998 --> 01:57:52,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's at the Andrews School and online tomorrow evening at 6.30 for the board.

1073
01:57:52,483 --> 01:57:57,606
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just really want people who are engaged in this to realize that that other meeting is tomorrow.

1074
01:57:58,547 --> 01:57:58,987

01:59:36,435 --> 01:59:36,815

[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote.

1105
01:59:44,997 --> 01:59:45,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari Fishman?

1106
01:59:45,758 --> 01:59:46,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1107
01:59:47,918 --> 01:59:48,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Annie String?

1108
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:49,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1109
01:59:50,539 --> 01:59:51,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben LaValle?

1110
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:53,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1111
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:54,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself, Peter Calvis.

1112
01:59:54,941 --> 01:59:57,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an aye.

1113
01:59:57,441 --> 01:59:58,882
[SPEAKER_02]: That is taken care of.

1114
02:00:00,845 --> 02:00:05,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next thing on the agenda is standing zoning updates.

1115
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:14,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume we have... I presume we have been sufficiently zoning updated unless there's anything else Alicia or Danielle want to share with us.

1116
02:00:16,415 --> 02:00:30,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly, so technically the City Council's Planning and Zoning Committee voted those three topics, West Medford, Medford Square, and ADUs out of committee.

1117
02:00:30,788 --> 02:00:35,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I had been asked by somebody for the exact language they voted out.

1118
02:00:35,432 --> 02:00:36,913
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not actually what they voted out.

1119
02:00:36,953 --> 02:00:39,035
[SPEAKER_07]: They voted those topics out of committee.

1120
02:00:39,635 --> 02:00:42,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And so Paola and Emily are preparing

1121
02:00:43,111 --> 02:00:47,114
[SPEAKER_07]: the map based on those conversations and the zoning language.

1122
02:00:47,935 --> 02:00:54,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the goal is to get it on the city council agenda on Tuesday to refer it to you.

1123
02:00:55,241 --> 02:00:58,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So they'll vote to refer it Tuesday.

1124
02:00:58,264 --> 02:01:02,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, we did not advertise that, right?

1125
02:01:02,307 --> 02:01:05,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're expecting it, correct?

1126
02:01:06,270 --> 02:01:09,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, apologies, my camera is not functioning all of a sudden.

1127
02:01:10,071 --> 02:01:11,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't get it to turn on.

1128
02:01:11,391 --> 02:01:12,111
[SPEAKER_06]: No idea why.

1129
02:01:13,992 --> 02:01:15,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we have not advertised it yet.

1130
02:01:18,133 --> 02:01:20,374
[SPEAKER_06]: My intention is to advertise it for June 7th.

1131
02:01:20,854 --> 02:01:24,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it June 7th, which is the next available?

1132
02:01:25,415 --> 02:01:26,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Or June 4th?

1133
02:01:27,315 --> 02:01:29,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was the first 4th.

1134
02:01:30,736 --> 02:01:32,317
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds right to me, June 4th.

1135
02:01:32,337 --> 02:01:33,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say June 4th.

1136
02:01:34,891 --> 02:01:36,052
[SPEAKER_09]: According to the calendar.

1137
02:01:36,092 --> 02:01:36,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes, yes.

1138
02:01:37,714 --> 02:01:40,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so right.

1139
02:01:40,357 --> 02:01:45,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is the update is that that's when the public hearing for that will start.

1140
02:01:47,329 --> 02:01:49,951
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for the Medford Square, West Medford Square and ADUs?

1141
02:01:50,692 --> 02:01:50,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1142
02:01:51,953 --> 02:01:52,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1143
02:01:52,353 --> 02:01:55,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the local ADUs as opposed to the protected ADUs?

1144
02:01:55,816 --> 02:01:56,417
[SPEAKER_07]: It's both.

1145
02:01:56,517 --> 02:02:11,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is an update to the Medford zoning regarding ADUs and it will have language in there that puts us in compliance with the state law and language that allows the local ADUs.

1146
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:20,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we have had language allowing ADUs, and it needed updating to be in compliance with the state law.

1147
02:02:22,327 --> 02:02:26,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, because some of it was that ADUs were only for single families.

1148
02:02:27,365 --> 02:02:32,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the new state law, the way that it was written was single family zones.

1149
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:37,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So anything in a single family zone can have an ADU, which doesn't always make sense.

1150
02:02:38,292 --> 02:02:53,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we're trying to be more permissive and allowing these local ADUs in the non-single family zoning districts so that singles, twos and threes can also have an opportunity to have an ADU.

1151
02:02:57,948 --> 02:02:59,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sounds good.

1152
02:03:03,011 --> 02:03:06,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else on zoning or is that all for now?

1153
02:03:08,483 --> 02:03:13,304
[SPEAKER_07]: We have also scheduled a public meeting for the end of the month.

1154
02:03:14,424 --> 02:03:16,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, my brain is shot.

1155
02:03:16,825 --> 02:03:23,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I will actually just point you all to the fact that the zoning webpage, we are very actively updating it.

1156
02:03:23,907 --> 02:03:33,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna give props to Councilor Kit Collins, who has been taking responsibility for that with our communications team.

1157
02:03:33,849 --> 02:03:38,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So if at any point you feel you want an update on where things stand,

1158
02:03:38,650 --> 02:03:50,339
[SPEAKER_07]: with regards to public meetings, what's been passed, what the timeline is, go there because she is updating it at least once a week.

1159
02:03:50,359 --> 02:03:52,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever there's a real change, she's updating it.

1160
02:03:53,662 --> 02:03:56,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So May 29th, we're going to discuss the other corridors.

1161
02:03:56,824 --> 02:04:05,686
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be in person and hopefully hybrid at Reed Hall at Tufts and Boston Ave, Main Street and the other corridors.

1162
02:04:06,147 --> 02:04:14,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And then June 9th, we're going to have a public meeting at the Medford Public Library about parking and transportation demand management and zoning.

1163
02:04:16,810 --> 02:04:25,492
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys should be aware of that, but go there for updates and links and information, especially if your friends and neighbors think you're an expert.

1164
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:26,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Send them there.

1165
02:04:30,281 --> 02:04:31,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.

1166
02:04:31,481 --> 02:04:37,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to, I will not be at our next meeting because I'll be taking my PE exam.

1167
02:04:37,583 --> 02:04:43,504
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully, I will pass at this go around, and then I will have bandwidth to think about this.

1168
02:04:43,524 --> 02:04:48,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

1169
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:48,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1170
02:04:50,704 --> 02:04:56,005
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I think that brings us to a motion to adjourn.

1171
02:04:56,205 --> 02:04:59,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for bearing with me, chairing for the first time.

1172
02:04:59,246 --> 02:05:01,206
[SPEAKER_09]: You did a great job.

1173
02:05:01,346 --> 02:05:03,467
[SPEAKER_09]: You did an absolutely fantastic job.

1174
02:05:03,487 --> 02:05:04,147

[SPEAKER_09]: I make a motion to adjourn the meeting for this session.
