    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=157.509s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=163.792s">So,</a>  I think I got everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=167.494s">All</a>  the board members who are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=179.482s">We'll</a>  go back to the public hearing notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=191.168s">So</a>  public hearing notice, City of Medford Mass Community Development Board, Chapter 94 zoning, November 18th, 2021 was when the hearing was opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=200.053s">Medford</a>  Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Thursday, November 18th, 2021 after 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=206.037s">That</a>  was continued to tonight, December 9th, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=209.057s">at</a>  6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=210.158s">via</a>  Zoom remote video conferencing to take the following actions with regard to the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=215.56s">Delete</a>  the existing ordinance in its entirety and replace with the proposed ordinance as referred to our board by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=226.986s">The</a>  full text of the proposed ordinance can be viewed in the office of the city clerk in city hall 103 or on the city's website at the planning <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=237.151s">development</a>  sustainability department page and look for the tab current CD board filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=244.177s">So</a>  at this time, I will call the continued hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=251.43s">open.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=252.552s">And</a>  what we'll do today because we only have limited time with Attorney Bobrowski is that we will do our best to get through the remainder of the proposal we got about halfway through in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=265.466s">And</a>  if we can at least get through his presentation and explanation will take <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=271.753s">question</a>  will go section by section and take questions and comments from the Community Development Board members and then allow members of the public to weigh in as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=282.838s">But</a>  if we can try to get this done in an hour and a half, if possible, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=289.021s">So</a>  maybe limit full discussion so that we can, after Attorney Bobrowski leaves, we could continue to <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=297.865s">to</a>  talk for some time and identify the areas that we want to dig into a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=303.768s">But</a>  our goal here will be to, I think, gather as much feedback as possible from board members and members of the public, and then compile it into a set of recommendations that we can come back after the holiday, the beginning of January, and finalize that feedback and send it on to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=327.443s">All</a>  right, Attorney Bobrowski, let me turn it over to you.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=331.944s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=332.925s">Amanda,</a>  if you would put on the current version, which I believe is draft nine to the section 6.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=342.448s">While</a>  Amanda's queuing it up, let me say a few words about where we're headed tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=350.71s">The</a>  old ordinance really has no performance standards for anything but the MUZ district. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=357.345s">there</a>  are very few performance standards that would talk about anything other than signs, which is section 6.2, the parking before that 6.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=368.548s">And</a>  so in section 6.3 and 6.4, Amanda, you can scroll down through that sign section, it's pretty long. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=377.691s">In</a>  section 6.3, we introduced landscaping and screening standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=381.532s">And</a>  the idea here is that these standards would apply to anything that requires <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=387.53s">a</a>  special permit or site plan approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=392.251s">I</a>  need to actually amend that applicability section to add that sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=398.333s">I've</a>  made a note to myself with regard to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=401.174s">It</a>  would say applicability when the city council, zoning board of appeals or community development board is granting either a special permit or site plan approval, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=414.268s">this</a>  consistency with this section would be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=417.33s">It's</a>  not intended to be something applicable to residential homes, single family or two family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=424.936s">So</a>  much of what starts this section 631 to 634 is existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=430.78s">And</a>  if you scroll down, you can see that this has just been renumbered and put in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=436.544s">So</a>  you can go to 635, which is this beginning of the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=441.69s">Beginning</a>  here at 635 I've added some new sections for your consideration large parking areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=447.273s">So,</a>  spaces over 20 spaces have one shade tree pretend parking spaces this is your typical standard today for parking in lots that have more than 10 spaces retaining walls can be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=462.258s">We</a>  want all unsightly areas, including refuse disposal facilities, HVAC equipment, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings to be screened from view from neighboring properties and streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=475.221s">Maintenance</a>  is required here with regard to landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=480.743s">So</a>  it's not, you know, you can't just plan it once and let it die and then figure you did your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=485.384s">You've</a>  got to keep it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=487.945s">Visibility</a>  requirements talks about <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=489.983s">corner</a>  visibility so you don't want anything blocking sight distance at an intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=495.686s">And</a>  like signs and special permits, the SPGA or the Community Development Board, if the use does not require a special permit, may, by special permit, waive the provisions of this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=505.751s">So</a>  there's flexibility in mind here for the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=509.372s">If</a>  they've got something that works just as well and they can ask for a waiver by special permit and it goes on from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=518.049s">So</a>  I'll stop there because we're about to head into one of the bigger changes, which is section 6.4, and ask if there are any questions.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=532.171s">Members</a>  of the board, do you have any questions or comments?</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=539.553s">Andre,</a>  this is David, I have a question.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=541.613s">Hi,</a>  David.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=544.073s">Question</a>  is on 6.3.11, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=548.672s">on</a>  the standard for the SPGA or Community Development Board to, I guess, well, to reduce or waive the requirements of the section. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=560.863s">And</a>  we see the standard in connection with parking, we see signage, it's something that recurs throughout the draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=570.973s">And</a>  I guess my question is, is that to, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=574.501s">this</a>  question to myself, whether that's too broad. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=576.882s">I</a>  definitely see the value in having some discretion, but I wonder if the discretion should be focused with some guide rails on it, such that like, okay, well, maybe you don't have as many shade trees, but you have more screening or less screening, but more shade trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=595.368s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=596.707s">I</a>  wonder if, to me, 6311 is a little bit too discretionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=603.271s">I</a>  feel like that that would leave the board the discretion to not enforce any of the requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=609.174s">Whereas</a>  I feel like it would be more appropriate if there was some offset required or some sense that one shortcoming is made up by an improvement on another category.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=623.682s">I</a>  can certainly understand your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=626.973s">know,</a>  boards change over time and one board's sense of propriety might not be the next memberships. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=635.919s">So</a>  I can take a crack at putting some guardrails, as you called it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=642.044s">But</a>  the basic principle is that I'm really tired of going to <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=647.827s">ZBA</a>  meetings at which somebody needs a bigger sign and they have to walk through the variance criteria, which just should never apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=655.012s">You</a>  can't have a bigger sign because of soil condition, shape, or topography. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=658.854s">You</a>  can't have less parking spaces because of soil conditions, shape, or topography. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=665.058s">And</a>  here landscaping would require a variance as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=668.06s">So</a>  I can try to craft something that addresses your concern.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=673.163s">Are</a>  there others who feel similarly? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=674.885s">Maybe</a>  I'm alone.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=679.807s">I</a>  guess my question is how, to the attorney, how common is this language used in other communities?</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=688.168s">Well,</a>  the most recent governor's legislation that passed in January last year says, for the first time, that you can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=699.55s">I've</a>  been doing this for 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=701.811s">When</a>  I did New Bedford, Compass Bank came to the city and said they wanted to put their headquarters downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=707.612s">But</a>  if you ran the parking numbers, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=710.238s">hundreds</a>  and hundreds of spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=712.419s">So</a>  the first time we did this was with the new Bedford ordinance where we said that you can reduce the number of required parking spaces provided that in effect, no substantial detriment shall result. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=727.169s">Since</a>  I've done a lot of towns and cities, this has been a condition, this has been something I've added in virtually everything for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=736.055s">Not</a>  hearing any complaints back, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=740.778s">You</a>  know, I think it's a good way of helping the business community develop in a sensitive manner, but not a rigid manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=753.388s">Just</a>  prescribing the number of parking spaces or landscaping requirements where there's natural vegetation, for example, and they have to now plant in the middle of that seems a bit rigid. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=768.02s">So</a>  that's my intent here.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=774.34s">Questions</a>  or comments from other board members? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=781.104s">Members</a>  of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=782.605s">And</a>  I can't see everybody right now since the screen's being shared, so you'd have to raise your hand with the function at the bottom of the Zoom screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=800.675s">Okay,</a>  Attorney Barresca, why don't we move on to 6.4?</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=804.027s">All</a>  of 6.4 is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=805.709s">So</a>  the origins of this come from a work I did in a fairly large suburb years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=814.035s">And</a>  as people began to build out, they realized that they had no standards for things like noise, lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=825.084s">They</a>  had no standards for how to develop a site in an orderly fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=831.965s">They</a>  had no standards for traffic and utility connections. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=836.148s">So</a>  those are the main ones here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=838.409s">But</a>  the idea like signs, parking, landscaping is that if the special permit granting authority or the CDB acting as site plan review authority is to make an intelligent decision, it ought to be somewhat objectified and not just left to minimize this or maximize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=856.95s">So</a>  there's an attempt here to create some standards in those various areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=862.513s">First,</a>  there's some exemptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=865.074s">So</a>  the exemptions would include emergency response, municipal uses and structures and events. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=874.178s">And</a>  then it gets right into the guts of it here, lighting standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=877.88s">And</a>  the idea here is that there won't be any overspill or glare produced by a new development onto an adjacent property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=885.732s">And</a>  that's a common standard that many municipalities, Watertown, for example, uses the same standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=893.435s">We're</a>  trying to keep light intensity down to a dull roar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=900.817s">Searchlights</a>  should not be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=902.958s">Outdoor</a>  signs restricted with certain types of lighting, flickering and flashing signs shall not be permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=912.601s">Height</a>  of fixtures, hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=915.273s">I</a>  mean, too often the parking lot is lit the same at seven when the last employee leaves as it is at one o'clock in the morning when there's really no need for the lights to be that bright. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=927.257s">I'm</a>  doing a project right now in Andover where we're going light by light and seeing what we can turn off in the middle of the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=935.32s">So</a>  those are just some, the way I put this together years ago was I did a really intensive internet search on <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=943.377s">progressive</a>  community standards, and I picked the best, and this is what it ended up as. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=949.282s">It</a>  gets tweaked when I see something better, so it's pretty much up to speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=955.887s">I</a>  can take these one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=957.569s">There's</a>  about six subsections here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=959.791s">So</a>  this was lighting, noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=964.835s">Again,</a>  the state standard for noise is in that paragraph one limitation, and it is 10 dBA above ambient. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=973.1s">And</a>  that's the division of air quality standard that's in 310 CMR 7.10. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=980.943s">And</a>  that's basically a doubling of the sound being produced by a facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=986.565s">And</a>  this would apply not only to new construction, but it would be a standard that would apply going forward as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=993.688s">So</a>  if there was an excess of noise above 10 dBA, then there would be enforcement possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1001.386s">A</a>  lot of these things are just projected when you're going through the permitting process and hopefully they work out, but sometimes they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1009.092s">Hours</a>  of operation for certain equipment is the next subject, A, B, and C. So they're pretty basic rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1017.958s">Loading,</a>  unloading, handling of boxes and crates, condition of noise pollution, pretty much banned between 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1025.784s">and</a>  8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1027.005s">Operating</a>  tools or equipment used in construction, drilling, demo work, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1031.478s">6</a>  p.m., 8 a.m., please don't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1034.421s">And</a>  operation of construction devices between 8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1036.882s">and</a>  6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1038.704s">in</a>  a manner that causes noise pollution should be avoided by best available technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1045.869s">Maybe</a>  I should stop with light and noise, and then I'll go on to site development standards.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1051.774s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1053.876s">Do</a>  board members have comments or questions about this section?</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1063.759s">Andre,</a>  David, I have a question.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1065.52s">Yes,</a>  David, thank you.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1066.361s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1069.403s">Andre,</a>  we've been, I think, sensitive to the idea of neighborhood character, and I've been challenging myself as we've been going through this process to try to really stick to more of the exact requirements of the exact topic at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1087.854s">So</a>  I had just a general suggestion there on 6.4.5 <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1093.861s">noise</a>  standards, and it's identifying three, I guess, goals of the noise standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1102.945s">And</a>  I thought perhaps instead of preserved neighborhood character, it could be something like guarding against increasing noise levels than existing in the neighborhood or <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1116.725s">to</a>  avoid introducing new types of noise not then present in the neighborhood, just as an alternative way to frame it and something more specific to noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1125.83s">Don't</a>  increase my noise and don't introduce new noise, rather than preserving the character.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1133.514s">Right,</a>  that's something that we've been trying to flag as we go along. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1138.276s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1146.022s">Other</a>  board members have comments or questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1158.905s">I</a>  actually had a question, although this is about the language before the noise and light. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1167.727s">It's</a>  6.4.2.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1174.766s">Applicants</a>  may seek a credit for development linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1178.688s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1179.968s">And</a>  I'm wondering if this is something that's that's common, or something the city council talked about wanted to put this in here.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1190.152s">Well,</a>  don't forget, you're, as far as I know, you're the only municipality in Massachusetts that has special legislation outside of Boston for linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1200.176s">There</a>  are other towns, there are other towns to charge them, but they're <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1204.179s">Their</a>  legality is quite dubious in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1207.82s">Um,</a>  but people that if you don't complain, there's no problem with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1212.542s">So</a>  what I did with the city council was there's provision in section 10.6.1 for credits. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1219.424s">And</a>  it says, if you do, um, this kind of work that we're outlining in section 6.4, you ought to be able to get a credit for linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1229.868s">Um,</a>  because the linkage fees will take that into account and set the linkage fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1234.031s">arguably</a>  at a lower rate.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1240.013s">And</a>  that process, how, I guess, how subjective is it?</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1248.617s">Well,</a>  I'm flipping back to 10.6.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1249.657s">Yeah,</a>  because I don't have that in front of me right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1253.098s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1255.179s">So</a>  10.6.1, what was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1258.901s">Yeah,</a>  a credit may be given for voluntary site-related improvements or dedications <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1263.447s">as</a>  approved or for work performed as required under section 6.4. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1269.028s">And</a>  then credit will be due, not due, will be due on when the development construction is completed and accepted, security is posted, or all design standards are in strict compliance with current state and city requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1287.472s">Credits</a>  may be provided before completion of specified improvements if assurances are given <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1292.622s">By</a>  the applicant and security is posted, any claim for credit must be made no later than the time of the application for the building permit, not transferable from one project to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1303.811s">Determinations</a>  by the CDB or OCD may be appealed to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1313.319s">That's</a>  the credit language.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1318.461s">I</a>  just want to flag that as something possibly discuss a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1323.667s">I</a>  mean, my interpretation of some of the things that would be required just for site plan review for a good project. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1336.638s">are</a>  not necessarily reasons to reduce the linkage fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1341.901s">You</a>  know, the linkage fee is more for mitigation of the impact of the project, which oftentimes is not, you know, impacts beyond the site itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1354.388s">So</a>  I just feel like maybe there could be some clarity around, you know, what kinds of <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1363.79s">credit</a>  could be given for what kind of work?</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1367.791s">That</a>  makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1368.992s">When</a>  we get to the credit section, perhaps we can take a look, but it is not shall be given, it may be given for work under 6.4.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1376.914s">Right,</a>  I just don't want it to become one of these things where we're arguing about it all the time.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1386.737s">Yeah,</a>  understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1391.578s">Shall</a>  I move on to site development standards? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1395.775s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1396.516s">Let's</a>  go ahead, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1398.437s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1399.338s">I</a>  probably should have or somebody, I should remember this from the meetings with the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1405.222s">The</a>  section on the hours of operation, I have some level of confidence and I'm searching right now that we have something in our ordinances about such things. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1414.689s">Were</a>  those compared or checked? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1418.452s">I</a>  would hate to accidentally put something in conflict with Metro's ordinances.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1423.015s">I</a>  believe that like most communities, Medford has an outdoor construction limitation, hours are set, but this is more, for example, the A is not construction, B is construction, so it would need to be consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1441.564s">And</a>  C would be outside the normal hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1450.068s">Normally</a>  municipalities say that <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1452.455s">Exterior</a>  construction is allowed between, I'm picking a number, 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1456.478s">or</a>  7.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1457.778s">on</a>  a weekday, and must conclude by 6 o'clock p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1462.081s">And</a>  on Saturdays, there are usually shorter hours, and on Sunday, it's usually prohibited. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1466.944s">But</a>  it doesn't apply to interior construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1469.065s">Usually,</a>  it's just exterior construction.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1472.808s">Attorney</a>  Bobrowski, why don't you go through all of the performance standards, and that way we don't have to stop after each section, because I know we don't have too much time.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1481.932s">All</a>  right, site development standards go to questions like, should I be able to strip my property of all vegetation and then market it and hope that somebody buys it before the sediment clogs the nearest storm drain? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1493.477s">So</a>  here you have a land disturbance requirements, replication, clearing for utility trenching limitations, site design. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1505.002s">So</a>  this is just an attempt to give some rough standards for <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1509.416s">For</a>  example, look at B, building shall be directed away from the crest of the hills. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1515.819s">Archaeological</a>  historical resources, preservation of existing vegetation, re-vegetation, limits of clearing, finished grade, topsoil for re-vegetation, irrigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1532.748s">I</a>  don't know if onsite wells are appropriate in Medford, but you can tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1538.508s">the</a>  development may be phased. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1540.169s">So</a>  these are just some things to think about in terms of setting up the very first steps, mostly before the issuance of the building permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1552.857s">What</a>  we would call pre-construction activities, grubbing and clearing, removal of vegetation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1563.304s">The</a>  next one is <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1565.648s">a</a>  brazen attempt to set some pedestrian access vehicular standards, traffic management standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1571.209s">So</a>  what we're thinking about here is access and the way that curb cuts should be faced for new construction, driveways, standards for driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1585.992s">You</a>  can see some linear measurements for curb cut suggested at 20 feet for residential, 30 feet for a commercial property. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1594.66s">Just</a>  a basic statement that interior circulation shall be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1599.263s">Transportation</a>  plan approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1603.006s">This</a>  in the instance where the development proposed is greater than 25,000 gross square feet, a full TIAS would be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1612.672s">That's</a>  the traffic engineers currency. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1616.315s">They</a>  do that in conjunction with mass DOT standards or ITE standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1621.258s">They're</a>  both pretty much the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1624.034s">And</a>  that's a full-blown traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1626.275s">It</a>  goes all the way through trip generation, trip distribution, crash data, site distance, and then volume, existing volume, and then loading the new traffic in with a seven-year build-out provided, and then finally level of service at intersections that are deemed appropriate by the traffic engineer and the peer reviewer, if you're using a peer reviewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1651.083s">And</a>  then, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1653.422s">If</a>  it's a 25,000 square foot project, it also needs a TMC. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1660.165s">This</a>  is going to use alternative measures to reduce the number of vehicles such as employee carpools, rail passes, monetary incentives, onsite shower facilities to allow biking to work for employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1677.593s">Reduction</a>  in parking is something we've already covered in 6.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1683.138s">and</a>  level of service maintenance or improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1685.399s">If</a>  you've got somebody coming in and they're going to take what is, you know, we're in Eastern Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1691.302s">So</a>  let's be honest, everything is D or worse, but if you're going to take it down below D, then you've got to provide some sort of information about what the cost estimate would be to restore that level of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1707.51s">And</a>  the same would apply in B. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1712.124s">Dangerous</a>  intersections would be identified, site distance would be identified, maximum parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1721.367s">This</a>  allows for maximum parking to be no more than 200% of the minimum number of spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1727.029s">Some</a>  communities say that the minimum and the maximum shall be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1731.97s">And</a>  then mitigation, which is the only way to fix this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1735.131s">Obviously</a>  you don't have jurisdiction over a state numbered highway, but you do have jurisdiction over the city's roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1742.08s">So</a>  such improvements could include widening the intersection, assuming it's available about extensive takings and or traffic signals if it meets the warrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1753.645s">And</a>  then the last section is on pedestrian and bicycle safety and traffic calming features kind of winds that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1763.55s">I'm</a>  doing a project right now in a town where for various reasons, it's not really possible to <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1771.592s">dictate</a>  how much traffic will head right or left up this road, but you can certainly make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1777.577s">My</a>  traffic engineer tells me by putting in crosswalks, bike lanes, rumble strips, landscape islands, because trucks will, while not required to go in a specific direction, will choose the other direction if you put those kinds of things in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1792.731s">And</a>  he also tells me that there's a new kind of speed hump <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1797.998s">that</a>  allows a fire truck to pass without impairment, but a regular truck is pretty much stuck in the mud. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1803.441s">So</a>  they typically don't like those roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1806.742s">Aesthetic</a>  standards, I didn't go too deep here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1809.004s">We're</a>  just trying to suggest that you shouldn't build something completely ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1812.765s">So</a>  harmony and scale, consistency with goals of the master plan, if any. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1818.448s">Same</a>  thing for utility security and emergency system standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1821.87s">We</a>  just want the pipes to be <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1824.45s">able</a>  to carry the load, so sufficient water capacity, sufficient sewage capacity, site security, so that the police chief has an idea of what's going on in the building and how he should respond in the event of an emergency, underground to the extent it's permissible, and a fire alarm system, perhaps directly wired in if the fire chief thinks that that's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1852.177s">Fiscal</a>  analysis is mostly for informational purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1855.88s">Proposed</a>  developments have a positive or a negative net fiscal position for the municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1861.264s">I</a>  think it's valuable information for you to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1864.886s">It</a>  may not be a determinant in how you make your special permit decision, but at the same time, it does assist you in the realm of planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1871.931s">So</a>  in the end, it's oftentimes very interesting to see what the promises versus the reality of net <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1882.565s">net</a>  cost benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1885.067s">And</a>  then 6.411 is the old MUZ standards here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1889.691s">So</a>  I don't know that these are terribly valuable and they seem a generation old at this point, but they're not certainly nothing wrong with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1898.558s">Don't</a>  vibrate, no radioactivity, odor should be limited, toxic noxious matter should be limited, dust and fly ash limited, smoke limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1908.206s">You</a>  can actually, in some of these cases now, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1910.979s">create</a>  a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1912.019s">For</a>  example, years ago, I learned about the Ringelmann smoke chart in which smoke is graded from clear to black. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1922.002s">And</a>  you can say, we don't want anything on the chart greater than number 12 or something to that effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1928.404s">And</a>  there's your waiver of standards provision again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1931.425s">So</a>  that's a parallel to the parking signage landscaping provisions that we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1940.19s">So</a>  when I do this in a municipality, first of all, I hope it's red because there's a lot in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1948.056s">I</a>  urge my client city or town to treat it as a sushi menu and order what you think is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1954.962s">I</a>  would never propose those standards that you have just looked at in Berkeley, you know, population 4,000, too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1963.389s">So</a>  we try to tailor it to fit the municipality's needs.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1972.499s">All</a>  right, thank you, Attorney Hrabowski. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1975.942s">Let</a>  me open the conversation to board members. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1981.586s">Again,</a>  since I can't see you, you may have to just unmic yourself and jump in, but introduce yourself, please.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1992.814s">Andre,</a>  this is David. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1994.295s">Yes,</a>  David, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1997.272s">Thanks,</a>  Attorney Poprosky. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=1998.853s">I</a>  thought the waiver of standards here actually was a little bit more like what I had in mind, which is it seems like you would be waiving some standards if you found some extra benefit or if it's consistent with the goals of the section, that sort of stuff I think would be, maybe that's along the lines of what I had in mind with my earlier comment.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2023.687s">So</a>  do you think that 6412 is adequate to just adapt for the parking ending and the signage ending and the landscaping ending.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2031.072s">That</a>  would, that would be my suggestion, because at least it keeps the board focused and exercising that discretion on the benefits of this particular section. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2040.877s">Um,</a>  and how they're that's might benefit the community overall.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2044.96s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2045.14s">The</a>  thinking here is that if it needs a special permit, since it's already at <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2050.662s">a</a>  city council or perhaps a ZBA hearing that that special permit granting authority should also control waivers, whether it's parking signs, landscaping or performance standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2062.428s">And</a>  that's another benefit for the business community and that they don't have to rush back and forth between two boards to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2068.772s">The</a>  CDB would administer these special permits only where the use is allowed as of right, but subject to site plan approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2077.147s">Of</a>  course the CDB could make recommendations to the special permit granting authority about the grant or denial of a waiver, but that would ultimately be the SPGA decision.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2089.479s">Okay,</a>  and I just had one one other item and I can't recall exactly when we discussed this but I know as a board we discussed something similar to 6.4 point 10 the fiscal analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2101.616s">And</a>  at the time we felt that at least that was, this is my recall and the board members can correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2109.467s">But</a>  I think the sense was, well that might be helpful information in some instances. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2115.021s">It</a>  is an extra burden on the developer to come up with it number one and number two, there are probably a lot of proposed developments that won't lend themselves necessarily to more of a number crunching exercise, and the numbers alone may not reflect the true and full benefit to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2133.413s">So</a>  I think we just had we were skeptical as to whether this was something of value to the city, but maybe my fellow board members can remind me where we left off there.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2149.452s">That</a>  was the, are you talking about the fiscal analysis, David?</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2153.235s">I</a>  am exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2154.036s">I</a>  think we, I think we were inclined not to, to have that kind of a standard in at least our submissions to our board. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2166.586s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2167.567s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2167.907s">One</a>  of the, one of the special permit granting criteria, if you look <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2175.161s">I'm</a>  gonna look for it right now, but I do it all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2178.022s">So</a>  I know that the final criterion in section 11.6, I believe, is potential fiscal impact, including impact on city services, tax base and employment, taking into account any proposed mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2201.169s">So</a>  that would be the sixth of the six criteria <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2204.736s">for</a>  special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2206.578s">And</a>  I would never advise a municipality to deny it because you didn't make enough money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2211.802s">But</a>  I do think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2213.643s">This</a>  all stems from work Judy Barrett and I have done over 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2218.027s">You</a>  hear developers puff the contributions that will be made to the community and then you do the cost benefit analysis or more appropriately, Judy does it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2228.556s">And</a>  it turns out that $180,000 a year is really more like 70 because <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2234.307s">it's</a>  gonna need three extra policemen.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2239.648s">Yeah,</a>  can you talk a little bit more about how something like this would be implemented? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2244.609s">Would</a>  this require a third party, you know, consultant to do the work? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2250.35s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2250.69s">And</a>  the way that it's written, it looks like it's required of every project and we don't get, we get a lot of smaller projects before our board.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2257.952s">Well,</a>  there's a waiver for you then. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2260.992s">So</a>  it wouldn't necessarily be done every time, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2265.401s">have</a>  you worked with Judy Barrett?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2268.122s">I</a>  know her, I haven't worked on the project.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2272.504s">She's</a>  the oldest practitioner of this art. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2276.425s">John,</a>  oh God, I've forgotten his last name. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2281.008s">They</a>  used to have Battle Royals, it was entertaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2283.909s">She's</a>  now retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2285.189s">He</a>  was more on the development side, Judy's more on the municipal side. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2289.771s">But</a>  it generally would be engagement of a third party <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2293.697s">of</a>  financial analysts, RKG does this up in New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2298.239s">There's</a>  another gentleman up in New Hampshire named Mark Fugere who does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2301.821s">And</a>  then you would have your own peer reviewer to take a look at this to see whether or not it's panning out as you thought.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2312.187s">Right,</a>  well, there's nothing that prevents us from requiring a developer to pay for <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2322.551s">a</a>  consultant to do the studies that are needed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2326.353s">Even</a>  without this language.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2328.614s">Well,</a>  you know, the developer, if they're proud of their contribution, may offer to do this because it's a selling point for the permit process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2336.117s">When</a>  we did an analysis of a senior housing facility up on the North shore, I think it came back something like of every tax dollar collected <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2348.096s">24,</a>  25 cents would go to the costs of the municipality and the other 75 cents was free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2354.059s">So</a>  that's an important thing to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2357.74s">It</a>  should not be the determinant. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2359.541s">I</a>  wanna make that very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2362.002s">You</a>  should never deny something solely on the basis of the fact that it's revenue neutral or it's revenue negative.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2370.045s">Right,</a>  well, and I think that if we were to keep something in here, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2376.714s">we</a>  seems like we would like to shift the language so because the way it's written right now it does sound proposed development shall maintain a positive net fiscal position for the long term does seem like it's something that could be a basis of a denial well i would also then be thinking about this in terms of that last special permit criterion and maybe</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2399.61s">following</a>  suit there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2400.95s">So</a>  if this is going to go away or get modified somehow, I think we probably would need to modify that sixth criteria as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2410.472s">Criterion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2413.753s">What</a>  do you think of the MUZ standards? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2417.013s">Can</a>  they go or do you want them to stay? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2418.834s">I</a>  mean, they certainly don't do any harm.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2422.534s">I</a>  don't have a strong opinion about it myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2424.375s">I</a>  don't know if other board members do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2429.92s">I</a>  don't hear a strong, anything.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2436.324s">You</a>  got a certain Smithsonian character to them, don't they?</p>

    <p>[Deanna Peabody]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2439.826s">How</a>  are they different from the ones that we just went through?</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2443.909s">Well,</a>  vibration, I mean, these, you know, you don't, there are no standards for odor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2452.594s">I</a>  mean, I guess that's why I left them in, but I, and I broadened them, note the strikeout, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2460.36s">The</a>  old version said just in the MUZ, my draft says that all uses of land, regardless of whether it's in an MUZ that requires a special permit or a site plan approval shall comply with these standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2475.624s">So</a>  it's going from MUZ to citywide for special permit projects.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2482.306s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2483.186s">I</a>  mean, I think it doesn't hurt to keep them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2487.427s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2492.384s">All</a>  right, are there members of the public who would like to speak about the performance standards? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2500.23s">Let</a>  me just stop the screen sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2511.719s">All</a>  right, Mr. Navarre. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2515.142s">And</a>  again, name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2517.632s">William</a>  DeVar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2520.995s">I</a>  just wanted to sort of echo some of the concerns that member Lumberg had. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2527.36s">I</a>  think that especially when I'm thinking about like, I think this applies to small apartment buildings, site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2534.426s">And</a>  people sometimes pontificate on the fiscal impacts of an apartment going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2541.933s">And</a>  while it might be interesting to have some data, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2545.769s">David</a>  Ensign, PB – He, Him, His): Rather us not put an extra burden on every multi family housing project of hiring a consultant to know that because we are in a housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2554.414s">David</a>  Ensign, PB – He, Him, His.: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2555.995s">:</a>  And maybe that maybe, maybe, maybe the city could do its own analysis on something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2562.199s">It</a>  feels like it shouldn't be that hard, but just the idea of having every housing project right <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2568.592s">But</a>  just having every developer do that, and you can avoid doing that by not building housing or building only a duplex, where maybe a triplex or something is appropriate given our housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2579.596s">I</a>  think that we should be concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2582.837s">Obviously,</a>  if somebody is building a massive paper mill or something, and it's going to make a mess, it's OK though, because it's good for the fiscal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2591.381s">I</a>  could see the point of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2593.121s">But</a>  if somebody is doing a six-unit apartment building, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2597.865s">I</a>  don't see that quite as much.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2598.946s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2606.211s">Other</a>  members of the public who would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2611.134s">And</a>  again, just, we're not, I think what we're trying to do here to get through the whole, all of Attorney Bobrowski's presentation is to mostly ask clarifying questions or raise flags for further conversation, but we want to take advantage of his time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2628.16s">Thank</a>  you, Attorney Baruski, why don't we move on?</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2631.101s">Okay,</a>  the next section talks about adult entertainment, adult uses, and I've made some changes, but they are necessary for constitutional reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2644.947s">So</a>  adult use, adult entertainment is protected speech under the First Amendment, and to target it directly by saying the adult use shall or the adult speech shall is <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2660.449s">it</a>  is going right after the First Amendment right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2663.631s">And</a>  you would need to show a compelling reason to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2665.832s">The</a>  Supreme Court of the United States has ruled in a parcel of cases that this is protected speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2671.975s">So</a>  accordingly, the typical regulation says that the purpose of the regulation is to address secondary effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2680.399s">Secondary</a>  effects, including increased crime, adverse impacts on health, business climate, property values, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2687.812s">and</a>  quality of life in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2689.814s">Those</a>  secondary targets are subject to reasonable time, place and manner restrictions under the First Amendment's jurisprudence. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2698.761s">So</a>  this is boilerplate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2700.362s">This</a>  is where the law begins and you have to be sure to do this or else it's a civil rights violation if you go too quickly after the speech itself rather than the secondary effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2714.448s">And</a>  I know from my work in other communities that you've had some experience with adult entertainment facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2721.351s">So</a>  I've added this for your protection and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2725.793s">Having</a>  said that, the other language in the section is what I could salvage from the existing small provisions that you had. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2735.717s">So</a>  adult entertainment establishments have been grouped together. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2740.198s">It's</a>  now a word that means bookstores, adult motion picture theaters, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2744.638s">adult</a>  video stores, adult cabaret, they're all adult entertainment establishments in the definition section. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2751.082s">And</a>  they're not closer than 750 feet from each other, a public or private nursery school. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2756.946s">I</a>  modernize daycare centers to include family daycare homes, childcare centers, school-age childcare programs, public or private kindergarten, school, schools and schools, playgrounds, churches, residential properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2770.355s">And</a>  then the actual enabling act <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2774.875s">requires</a>  that you eliminate from consideration anybody convicted of or violating these statutes, chapter 119, section 63, or chapter 272, section 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2788.503s">And</a>  you don't want these things visible from a window onto the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2793.486s">That's</a>  another typical condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2795.748s">So</a>  it looks like it's a lot of rewrite, but it's pretty much what you had before with some constitutionality added. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2804.719s">Section</a>  7.2, section seven is special regulations that apply to just a particular kind of business or a kind of activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2814.648s">It's</a>  not general in applicability because it's not parking that applies to multiple purposes or signs or landscaping or performance standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2824.316s">These</a>  are just special regulations for section 7.2 retailer wholesale store factory manufacturing plant. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2831.962s">My</a>  guess is that <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2833.296s">These</a>  were added a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2835.078s">They</a>  continue to be in your old ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2837.06s">They're</a>  not doing any harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2838.581s">So</a>  they're in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2840.063s">Uh,</a>  limitations on genetic biomed and chemical research. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2843.346s">Again,</a>  not a word change. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2844.987s">This</a>  is, um, what you have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2849.071s">It</a>  does prohibit, uh, bio level four, uh, in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2854.497s">Solar,</a>  um, is a very interesting solar bylaw. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2858.409s">or</a>  ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2859.549s">Normally</a>  I see solar energy systems regulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2862.29s">A</a>  solar energy system is the term in the statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2866.552s">So</a>  good to call it that because you then get the benefits of the statutory protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2871.734s">Solar</a>  energy systems are in flux right now if you are to over-regulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2878.097s">Many</a>  smaller communities, rural communities, suburban communities say you can only have large scale ground-mounted <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2885.555s">photovoltaic</a>  facilities in a certain district and then by special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2890.057s">That's</a>  now been litigated at the land court and now the appeals court. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2893.738s">Judge</a>  Piper, chief judge of the land court, has ruled that the protection for solar energy systems is the same as the Dover protection for a church, school, or a child care facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2905.323s">That's</a>  now working its way up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2907.143s">That's</a>  a massive change out where I live. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2910.845s">Here,</a>  you're really <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2912.679s">Taking</a>  the opposite tack, you're saying we want solar energy systems if your building contains 10 or more units. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2919.141s">We</a>  want if it's new construction of 10,000 square feet or more of floor area. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2923.582s">So</a>  I congratulate you for this approach that encourages, if not requires, solar energy in certain situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2932.144s">And</a>  I've taken what I believe was a general ordinance and moved it over here into zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2939.865s">vacant</a>  and foreclosing property section 7.5 is what you have now.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2944.469s">Excuse</a>  me, we have Director Schrader from the city who raised his hand.</p>

    <p>[Victor Schrader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2951.395s">Thank</a>  you, Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2953.337s">Mark</a>  in section 7.3 limitations on genetic biomedical and chemical research we added biosafety level three to that our current ordinance restricts level four. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2966.106s">And</a>  we discussed adding three with city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2968.687s">I</a>  just want to make note of that.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2971.267s">I'm</a>  looking at a color coded version that predates the one that you have on your screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2978.629s">So</a>  I'm just going to take a second to look to see in the draft nine, whether that's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2985.531s">Change</a>  has been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2987.211s">Take</a>  me a second.</p>

    <p>[Victor Schrader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2989.252s">I</a>  believe it has.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2990.152s">It</a>  was just wanted to make sure it has been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2993.193s">Yeah,</a>  I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2996.287s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2996.607s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=2999.328s">So</a>  vacant foreclosing properties is unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3002.449s">I've</a>  never seen this before in anybody's anybody else's ordinances, but I, you know, it's, it's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3008.831s">It</a>  seems to have a valuable purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3010.672s">And</a>  so I've just renumbered it and placed it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3016.154s">And</a>  at the end of this section, adult use marijuana establishments, this would be your contribution to <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3025.303s">recreational</a>  marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3029.784s">And</a>  I believe I just renumbered what you have.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3037.785s">Yeah,</a>  and that's was recently addressed by the city council so this is all something that we're not revisiting here, really just. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3047.987s">It's</a>  a very long section but we can we can just go through that scroll through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3051.988s">I</a>  mean, yeah.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3055.996s">And</a>  then finally, it never ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3066.421s">Wireless</a>  telecommunications. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3068.401s">So</a>  this is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3069.182s">I</a>  saw nothing in the existing ordinance that talked about wireless. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3078.186s">So</a>  I worked with Paul Moki and <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3082.127s">City</a>  Council to come up with something that we thought would manage effectively what the rules should be for wireless antenna and monopoles if needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3095.117s">There</a>  was some question about whether or not the next generation of wireless, which I believe is mounted more on telephone poles, should be covered by these regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3109.982s">Telephone</a>  poles are generally in the public way and they are not subject to zoning regulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3117.785s">So</a>  this looks more at the regulations for the ability of the provision of cell service from five years ago rather than the provision five years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3136.332s">But</a>  you didn't have anything before, so.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3141.4s">And</a>  is there anything that we need to know about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3144.062s">And</a>  Amanda, can you just scroll through a little bit?</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3149.406s">Yeah,</a>  so what I tried to do was create a system here by which any construction of new wireless telecommunication facilities would be avoided where there's no proof in advance that it's actually needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3165.318s">As</a>  you may know, the facilities have coverage areas that can be determined by <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3172.151s">a</a>  technician and gaps in coverage are prohibited. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3176.034s">So</a>  the Wireless Telecommunications Act says that you cannot discriminate between carriers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3181.758s">You</a>  cannot prohibit facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3184.26s">And</a>  by that, the law has been interpreted to mean that a gap in coverage is a prohibition, which is not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3192.185s">So</a>  you have to kind of space the area in which these things can go so that you kill the gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3199.411s">And</a>  if you have a gap even then, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3202.088s">and</a>  someone wants to locate outside an area that's been approved, there's a Massachusetts appeals court case that says it's eligible for a variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3211.552s">And</a>  instead of applying the usual variance standards, you adapt the variance standards to the wireless standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3217.415s">Wireless</a>  denials have to be based on substantial evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3221.056s">So</a>  that ratchets up the usual.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3223.377s">I'm</a>  sorry, Amanda, can you just stop on the criteria there so that people can read that on the screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3229.08s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3231.458s">Let</a>  me come back and see where she stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3235.38s">Okay,</a>  so yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3236.96s">So</a>  the applicant's not already providing adequate coverage, not able to use an existing facility, minimize adverse impacts, agreed to implement reasonable measures to mitigate possible adverse impacts, FCC regs, and they've agreed to rent without discrimination to other. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3258.369s">That</a>  parallels the words of the statute there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3263.328s">So</a>  you would have as a first option here that this could go in a church steeple or it could go on a roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3268.131s">But</a>  if it's talking about putting up a new monopole, you really have to go through the grind here in order to show that that should be your last choice.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3285.301s">And</a>  as you just mentioned, Attorney Bobrowsky, so this doesn't cover things like, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3291.54s">you</a>  know, on a commercial building or a steeple.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3296.983s">No,</a>  it, it, it does allow for concealed antennas and, um, building mounted as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3311.231s">So</a>  you can see the preference here, location seven, seven, four, their priorities established. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3318.037s">Applicants</a>  shall demonstrate they've investigated the higher priority rankings than the one in which they're applying and why they can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3324.581s">First</a>  priority within an existing structure concealed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3328.704s">Second</a>  priority on industrial or commercially zoned land. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3331.426s">Third</a>  within an existing structure, camouflage not concealed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3335.589s">Then</a>  it goes, it ranks these further down to number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3339.571s">So</a>  the only time you get to building a new facility, and it can only be a monopole a hundred feet high, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3346.097s">would</a>  be we can't do one through six. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3354.925s">And</a>  I borrowed a little from Lexington. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3356.746s">I</a>  borrowed a little from Quincy, I think, and we came up with a hybrid.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3367.716s">Is</a>  that the end of section seven? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3370.318s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3372.24s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3373.597s">Any</a>  board members have comments or questions about section seven? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3377.979s">Again,</a>  feel free to speak up since we're sharing the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3386.222s">I</a>  think it seems pretty straightforward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3395.585s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3396.325s">Any</a>  members of the public want to speak on section seven before moving on? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3407.552s">All</a>  right, I don't see anybody, so let's move on to section eight.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3411.693s">Okay,</a>  again, now we're in an area of the bylaw, the ordinance rather, that has just been moved over and renumbered. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3418.535s">So</a>  inclusionary zoning has just been renumbered. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3421.376s">In</a>  fact, I gave your inclusionary zoning provision to the city of Haverhill, which has established a task force for downtown affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3429.498s">I'm</a>  the legal advisor to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3431.739s">I</a>  gave them yours, Quincy's, Brookline's, and Newton's. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3439.438s">So</a>  this is just remembered and scrolling through accessory dwelling units we did spend a considerable amount of time on this at the council at us were a target of governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3460.765s">And</a>  what the governor said in the legislation, and now law is that an ad you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3468.148s">has</a>  a certain definition to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3469.949s">I</a>  think that's worth reviewing the definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3472.05s">So</a>  I'll just jump down to the definition in my version here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3476.892s">So</a>  an ADU is a self-contained housing unit inclusive of sleeping, cooking and sanitary facilities on the same lot as the principal dwelling as defined in chapter 40A, section 1A. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3494.399s">I</a>  believe that the size limitation <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3497.077s">of</a>  an ADU is not more than, I don't remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3504.238s">I've</a>  got to look at that definition, but it's not more than half the size of the principal structure or I believe 800 square feet, whichever is smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3514.441s">So</a>  that might not be the exact number, but there is a definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3518.541s">So</a>  this section- 900. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3520.182s">Is</a>  it 900? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3520.482s">I</a>  think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3521.442s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3521.782s">I</a>  have to check. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3524.363s">So</a>  this is incorporating the governor's <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3526.902s">standard.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3527.562s">And</a>  the governor says you can allow them by right in the principal dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3532.825s">And</a>  you can also allow them in an accessory structure on the same lot as the principal dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3538.447s">And</a>  the city council made the choice back in section eight point. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3545.831s">I'm</a>  just scrolling back up in my on screen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3560.831s">So</a>  the city council made the choice to allow them by right in the principal unit and by special permit in an accessory unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3569.718s">And</a>  this has repercussions for your voting because under the governor's act, some of this now only requires a 50% vote of the council instead of the two thirds. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3580.807s">And</a>  some of it only requires the same change for the actual special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3590.574s">So</a>  ADU is allowed as of right in the principal dwelling or by special permit in an existing detached structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3597.956s">Both</a>  of those are consistent with the governor's language. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3601.578s">And</a>  then the requirements are pretty much a hybrid of new and old. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3605.799s">This</a>  is what you had before in large measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3608.48s">No,</a>  900 square feet, I see it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3611.421s">That's</a>  the definition in the statute.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3616.583s">Right,</a>  so just again to clarify for folks, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3621.027s">If</a>  there's an accessory dwelling unit, which is kind of an accessory apartment, oftentimes they're called in-law units. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3632.553s">They</a>  can be used for a caretaker or a family member. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3637.475s">So</a>  you can have multi-generational family living together or nearby. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3644.759s">That,</a>  as long as it's inside the existing single family home, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3650.155s">and</a>  it doesn't change the outside of the home that people are allowed to do that as of right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3658.822s">You</a>  don't need a special permit, but if you're going to propose putting one of these accessory apartments in your backyard, for example, then you need to get a special permit.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3673.214s">Yeah,</a>  and I believe the key language there would be in a detached structure <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3681.806s">in</a>  an existing detached structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3683.968s">So</a>  it's got, it's targeting things like a garage with a second floor or a carriage house or something to that effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3693.575s">It</a>  doesn't, this is not something that is specifically, I'm sure there may be a question on this, so I'm addressing it in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3699.779s">This</a>  is not something that would be, that was designed to accommodate a tiny house as a second dwelling unit on a lot.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3709.477s">Mr.</a>  Chair, if I might ask specifically on that point, Attorney Brabowski, this is Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3716.52s">Would</a>  that, does that absence of that imply that they are not permitted? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3722.363s">There</a>  is no route to create a new accessory detached structure to then add a accessory dwelling unit?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3734.088s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3738.187s">And</a>  I've been reading about what they're doing in California to promote affordable housing in a state that doesn't have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3746.155s">And</a>  it seems like their idea would be to allow for a tiny home as a second dwelling unit on a lot, I'm sure that meets certain characteristics. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3755.443s">But</a>  the only place I know in Massachusetts that does that as a cultural thing is Nantucket.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3766.43s">There</a>  have been a number of communities that have moved in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3769.911s">So</a>  that's something that I'm certainly interested in looking into a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3776.332s">I</a>  know the city of Newton, I believe they also, they allow detached ones by special permit now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3782.353s">I</a>  can look into that more.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3783.753s">But</a>  is that new construction or existing structures?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3786.273s">I</a>  believe it's new.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3787.634s">Okay,</a>  well, it wouldn't surprise me.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3793.915s">I</a>  know Arlington passed <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3795.933s">ADU</a>  ordinance recently, but I haven't checked to see whether the new detached units are allowed or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3803.035s">I</a>  thought they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3810.658s">I'm</a>  sorry, what's that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3811.378s">That</a>  was Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3812.218s">I</a>  think Arlington and Newton might be worth looking at.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3817.84s">Yeah,</a>  I've been asked this question quite often recently.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3823.26s">So</a>  just, yeah, just want to flag that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3824.86s">I</a>  think this is great that the city council wants to move in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3827.941s">And</a>  I think maybe we just want to, we could consider making a recommendation about expanding it a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3835.543s">Obviously</a>  they're going to make the choice whether to do that or not, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3841.864s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3843.344s">Senior</a>  housing is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3845.105s">This</a>  section only has a couple of sections left. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3847.065s">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3849.085s">So</a>  this would be a, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3852.836s">blanket</a>  provision that allows senior housing facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3856.058s">They</a>  would be defined in 832 when you look back at the definitions as independent living, assisted living, including memory unit, long-term care facility or congregate care facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3867.487s">Congregate</a>  care would be one or more of the other three components together in a single facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3875.072s">So</a>  the idea here is that your baby boomers are all going to <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3882.59s">find</a>  themselves needing some sort of an end place. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3886.293s">And</a>  these, you know, very typically are a choice that benefits people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3892.698s">All</a>  allowed by special permit from the CDB just in 833. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3899.543s">So</a>  there's a flexible approach here in that we are not recommending any kind of density ratio by per square foot of lot size, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3911.733s">It's</a>  more or less bring me something to look at and we'll see if we like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3917.577s">And</a>  if we don't, and if it's five pounds of sugar in a two pound bag, we'll say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3922.761s">But</a>  the height limitations, 35 feet, unless a building is being renovated, 20 foot setbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3931.848s">You</a>  want it to be a little bit further away from existing residential dwellings because it's a different character. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3938.233s">I</a>  just litigated one of these up in Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3941.895s">100</a>  beds, it's probably about, oh, it's probably, it's certainly well over 50,000 square feet in size. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3951.703s">And</a>  it's in a residential district. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3953.044s">So</a>  you'd wanna be sure where you're going with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3956.067s">But</a>  again, the idea here is that the housing is needed for people aging in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3961.431s">And</a>  this is of particular benefit to a city because it is revenue positive by a huge measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3971.16s">And</a>  then the city council also explored whether or not to add short-term rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3975.321s">Paul</a>  Moki was particularly involved in this provision. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3978.822s">And</a>  we took a look at trying to remember where the example came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3985.024s">We</a>  looked at Cambridge and we looked at one other one and Paul and I kind of selected what we thought were the best features. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3991.846s">And</a>  this is the product of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=3993.427s">So</a>  short-term rental would address things like VRBO or Airbnb housing <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4000.892s">and</a>  put some regulations in place so that a neighborhood isn't disrupted by people constantly just renting the structure and parties bothering people. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4016.116s">Consistent</a>  with what's happened in other destination cities like New Orleans in the past two or three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4028.755s">And</a>  those are the special residential regulations that the ordinance contemplated. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4035.878s">If</a>  I can go through one more, there are special district regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4045.282s">There's</a>  only two. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4046.243s">The</a>  old mixed use zoning district has got a lot of rules that don't lend themselves to placement in the dimensional section. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4054.246s">So</a>  we just kept the language intact here and moved it over to a new home <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4058.765s">under</a>  special district regs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4062.086s">And</a>  then an innovative idea that the city council liked was section 9.2, and that is planned development district. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4071.95s">This</a>  comes from my experience in a few places, Quincy, Burlington, and Lexington to name three. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4079.273s">Planned</a>  development district is an invitation, if you will, not a regulation, it's to <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4086.598s">ask</a>  the development community if they have a specific proposal for a piece of land that would be rezoned to a PDD. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4094.221s">PDD</a>  can be either residential or commercial or mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4099.544s">And</a>  this is essentially a rezoning of the parcel and then the city could always put it on special permit after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4108.507s">But</a>  it has to be a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4111.149s">So</a>  if someone were to come to see the planning office and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4115.512s">a</a>  widget factory on this parcel of land, in order for this to go anywhere, the planning department would have to say, good idea, let's take it up a notch. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4124.535s">And</a>  then together they would draft the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4127.716s">My</a>  experience is that cities are really bad at predicting what will work for developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4134.299s">They're</a>  not in the business of trying to turn a dime into a profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4138.76s">And</a>  so predicting things like a PUD does, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4143.902s">generally</a>  don't attract any takers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4147.884s">PUD</a>  is typically some residential component, some commercial component, and some office component. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4154.448s">But</a>  I mean, I know of a PUD that qualified in Salem that's a dentist office, a duplex, and a stop and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4161.072s">That's</a>  not what we had in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4163.054s">Quincy</a>  does these now in their larger commercial developments, and every one is a separate district. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4170.438s">If</a>  you drive Hartwell Avenue, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4172.968s">in</a>  Lexington on the west side of 128 from the 4-225 exit down to the next exit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4179.492s">Those</a>  are all PDDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4181.012s">Every</a>  one of those is its own district because somebody had a different idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4185.294s">And</a>  Burlington is doing the same thing with its old mall properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4189.997s">The</a>  district, if you know where that is in Burlington, is a PDD. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4195.159s">These</a>  rules have to be written in a way that predict the outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4198.661s">So</a>  if you leave them too loosey-goosey, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4201.167s">then</a>  the problem is that you probably won't get what you bargained for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4205.568s">So</a>  the idea would be that there's an ordinance worked out between the city and the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4212.089s">The</a>  text of the amendment is up for grabs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4215.29s">The</a>  map of the amendment is up for grabs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4217.07s">The</a>  uses are up for grabs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4218.931s">It</a>  goes through the process of a preliminary plan and then a city council vote at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4226.192s">When</a>  I just recodified Haverhill last year, this is in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4231.12s">We've</a>  now passed our first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4232.64s">It's</a>  a project that reuses an old banquet facility site on the Bradford side. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4239.863s">And</a>  we liked the idea, we voted it, and I believe they're under construction already. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4244.164s">There's</a>  another one coming downtown that we may do as a PDD. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4248.685s">So</a>  this is the most, for me, this is the most progressive way to develop land in a partnership with a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4259.745s">Uh,</a>  where the city is getting as well as giving and the developer, uh, is putting something in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4265.629s">That's</a>  going to be a real benefit to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4271.553s">If</a>  it goes to special permanent, it need not. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4273.715s">These</a>  are the criteria in section 9.2 0.7, Amanda nine to seven, but it truly has to be a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4288.343s">This</a>  is what smart growth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4290.185s">If</a>  you take a look at chapter 40-R, then this is the same idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4294.45s">There's</a>  no spot zoning in chapter 40-R. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4296.873s">And</a>  I think spot zoning is pretty much dead as a doctrine in 40-A as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4307.826s">So</a>  I'll stop there.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4317.135s">lot</a>  to, to absorb and we're going through it very, very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4321.359s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4324.822s">Do</a>  any board members have questions or concerns they'd like to raise.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4330.527s">Interesting.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4336.021s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify on the plan development districts that this, this is something that the developer would have to pitch to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4347.086s">It's</a>  not something the city could, for instance, use to for purposes of a taking or some urban development, urban revitalization sort of project.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_92EldazEY&t=4361.752s">No</a>  big partnership.</p>
