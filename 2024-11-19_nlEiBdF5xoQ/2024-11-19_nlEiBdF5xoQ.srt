10
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello.

11
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

12
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:22,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, before I give the update, I want to give a shout out to Barbara Kerr and her library staff.

13
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:39,255
[SPEAKER_05]: While other libraries have been closed or barely doing any work, last month our library circulated 19,562 books and other materials, which is the highest since we've moved into the warehouse space.

14
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:49,219
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, we've done 39 virtual programs with 600 people in attendance, 18 children's programs, 14 teen programs, and seven adult programs.

15
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:54,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been doing this since November, while other libraries are just starting to do now.

16
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. President, I want to just give a shout out to Barbara.

17
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:03,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we are probably the most successful library in the Minute Man network.

18
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:06,427
[SPEAKER_05]: during this pandemic.

19
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:07,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Barbara's on the call.

20
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:16,451
[SPEAKER_05]: She might wanna say something before I get into where we are with the Henry Foundation.

21
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for letting me come.

22
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:20,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you need my name and stuff?

23
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:22,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Ms.

24
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Kerr, name and address for the record.

25
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:26,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Barbara Kerr, 35 Baker Place, Newton Lower Falls.

26
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,657
[SPEAKER_07]: We were very lucky.

27
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:44,138
[SPEAKER_07]: basement, for those of you who've been over to Boston Avenue, it's a very awkward space in the basement of an office building, but it turned out to be perfect for a pandemic because we are pretty much the only people on that floor.

28
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:54,521
[SPEAKER_07]: There is an exterior hallway, and we can leave materials for people to pick up on tables in the hallway, where most other libraries are having to do a whole

29
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:00,972
[SPEAKER_07]: you schedule a drop-off and you drive up to the front and they like throw books in your car and you drive away.

30
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:09,717
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is a very restricted volume where we basically, our volume is restricted by when we run out of plastic bags.

31
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:14,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have been averaging 16,000 items in physical items a month.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I did some stats this morning and we've been doing that since we reopened in May.

33
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:30,005
[SPEAKER_07]: We started putting stuff out in the hallway at the end of May and we started doing appointments in August and computer appointments in November.

34
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:41,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And as Rick said, there are still a lot of libraries that are not doing any kind of appointment access and who are doing very limited pickup of materials.

35
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,931
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it was an awkward place to land, but we were very lucky in the end.

36
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:51,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and I do have a very good group of people because doing

37
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:56,269
[SPEAKER_07]: direct public service has been pretty scary in the last year and they did it.

38
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:01,811
[SPEAKER_07]: They were very, we took a lot of precautions, but they've provided very good public service.

39
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:07,353
[SPEAKER_07]: And the children and teen programming folks realized that you could still do a craft program.

40
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:14,195
[SPEAKER_07]: You just had to put the supplies in a bag and put that in the hall and then have a Zoom and everybody does crafts together on the Zoom.

41
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:18,457
[SPEAKER_07]: And Zoom actually turned out to be a remarkably good platform for lectures.

42
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:21,618
[SPEAKER_07]: We had Robert Reich, who I forget

43
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:25,488
[SPEAKER_07]: who he was, but he was a, he's a, he's an economist or something.

44
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:25,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

45
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:32,332
[SPEAKER_07]: We were, we were able to collaborate with six other libraries to have a program with him and they had 800 people on the Zoom.

46
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the most we've ever had at a program is a hundred.

47
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:48,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think as we go forward, some of our programming will probably still be Zoom or a Zoom in-person hybrid because it's, you don't have to leave your house.

48
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,563
[SPEAKER_07]: So it works pretty well.

49
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:53,748
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the former Secretary of Labor, Barbara.

50
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:56,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew he was that.

51
00:04:56,549 --> 00:05:00,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I meant to look it up before I came on here and not display my ignorance.

52
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,172
[SPEAKER_07]: However, now I'm on tape displaying my ignorance.

53
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:06,514
[SPEAKER_07]: But my people have done a very good job.

54
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:09,635
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's been a challenge.

55
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:12,217
[SPEAKER_07]: But we were fortunate to land at Boston Avenue.

56
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:14,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

57
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:16,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to talk about the building?

58
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:18,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

59
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk about the building, Barbara.

60
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:22,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, thank you, Barbara.

61
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:27,387
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great, almost 20,000 books on a library that's barely open.

62
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:31,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I just wanted to give everybody a little update.

63
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:43,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most of us have taken the tour of the building, I think a couple of weeks ago, and we're looking at sometime, I think, probably September opening, give or take a little bit.

64
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably by the end of September.

65
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:47,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully by the end of September,

66
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,495
[SPEAKER_05]: have it open and everything seems to be gone.

67
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:55,516
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to give you a little brief update on the money raised by the foundation.

68
00:05:56,797 --> 00:06:03,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So as of today, the foundation has total cash and pledges and gifts in the amount of $5,207,255.

69
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also have two in-kind pledges from both Cummings and East Cambridge Savings Bank.

70
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:25,658
[SPEAKER_05]: for their pledges, and East Cambridge and Bill Cummings also made donations on top of their in-kind pledges.

71
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:26,919
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank them too for both that.

72
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:36,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And so at the moment, we have a grand total of commitments and gifts of $5,487,255.

73
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:45,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I'm told, I'm hearing there's another 100,000 coming from another donor, and we may see one more coming.

74
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:47,135
[SPEAKER_05]: But so far,

75
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:51,827
[SPEAKER_05]: We've, the cash we've taken in is $4,278,368.

76
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:58,109
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just about all the money we raised is almost all here.

77
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:05,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I want to thank the people on the commission that I work with for all their work on this.

78
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:14,036
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've also started a new campaign and I want to thank Ken Kraus and his wife Laura for

79
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:22,440
[SPEAKER_05]: taking the lead on this and Canada's White started the Green Campaign with a $25,000 donation.

80
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank you for that.

81
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:29,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And the objective is to sell 111 solar panels that are to be underwritten.

82
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:37,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So as of today, the Green Campaign has already raised $58,000 and that's been pledged.

83
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to thank Canada's White

84
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:56,360
[SPEAKER_05]: but for the scientists and all the people who've donated so far up to this, and hopefully the cost from our city will be as little as possible.

85
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:57,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

86
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:05,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I can.

87
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

88
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:15,151
[SPEAKER_04]: First, let me thank Councilor Caraviello, because I think that it was your leadership

89
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:27,334
[SPEAKER_04]: that started this journey and say what you want, it's too big, we don't need this, this, that, the other thing, this is truly gonna be a gem in our community.

90
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:45,243
[SPEAKER_04]: When you talk about gateways to our most important spots in our city, you're talking about driving it to Method Square and now seeing this unbelievable building that's gonna be open to our residents in so many various ways and truly being a true community

91
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,303
[SPEAKER_04]: community facility.

92
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:52,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, Barbara, again, it takes a great leader to, to lead the way.

93
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:56,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And Barbara's, you know, the, the only knock is Barbara doesn't actually live in Medford.

94
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:02,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should actually find her a home, you know, maybe next door, you know, get her in here.

95
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:04,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And so she's just been amazing.

96
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:06,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that her team's been amazing.

97
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:14,284
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, like we said, especially during the toughest times during COVID and working for recreation, I know exactly what she's talking about.

98
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:19,435
[SPEAKER_04]: and how we can still provide a service to our constituents.

99
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:20,255
[SPEAKER_04]: And she did that.

100
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:25,878
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're talking about the volume of work that you've done over the most difficult times, I applaud her efforts.

101
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:43,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And so again, I know that, I know Councilor Caraviello keeps challenging us to pledge and get out there and help raise that money and lessen the burden to the taxpayers, but I appreciate all his work.

102
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,044
[SPEAKER_04]: his efforts, so thank you.

103
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

104
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:49,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

105
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:56,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks, thank you to President Caraviello for all your hard work on this project.

106
00:09:56,367 --> 00:10:12,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when you first came back from, I think it was the Mass Municipal Conference, talking about a grant for the library, and it didn't seem like it was that long ago, and here we are, where actually there's a building going up and it's in the ground,

107
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:14,438
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of great things happening there.

108
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:20,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for all your hard work with regard to this project, with regard to everything else you do.

109
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:21,686
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for the update.

110
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:26,251
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always good to get an update to find out where we are financially with the funds coming in.

111
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:29,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you to Barbara and her staff as well.

112
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:31,357
[SPEAKER_06]: They've done a remarkable job.

113
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,413
[SPEAKER_06]: and not under the best conditions.

114
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:46,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's been a challenge the past year or so, and look forward to seeing the library open soon and all the good things and great programming that's going to come out of that.

115
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:51,116
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be remarkable when all is said and done.

116
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:53,977
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you to Barbara and her staff.

117
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:58,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to President Caraviello, and thank you to everyone that was involved in the fundraising.

118
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:06,718
[SPEAKER_06]: to this new project that I can cross and mark back in any spirit as well.

119
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:07,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you to everyone.

120
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:08,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

121
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councilor Bears.

122
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

123
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:19,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just so excited for this building to open.

124
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:27,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I am hopeful that by the fall, the schedules will line up and we'll be able to have an in-person event of some kind

125
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:36,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully it can be a celebration of community, not just coming out of this pandemic, but also coming together around this great community institution.

126
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:37,405
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just pumped.

127
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:41,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to reserve a meeting room, take out a book.

128
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:50,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also just want to thank Barbara, the whole library staff, the library foundation, and the board of the library foundation.

129
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:56,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's also an amazing testament to our community that we have raised so much money to support this.

130
00:11:57,737 --> 00:12:02,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got an email from Ken as well around the green campaign.

131
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:07,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's just another community value, having solar panels on the building.

132
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:14,564
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really, this project just speaks to, I think, so many of the wonderful things about Medford and I'm excited for this fall.

133
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:15,685
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to everybody.

134
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

135
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:23,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

136
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,309
[SPEAKER_05]: A big shell goes off very slow.

137
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:37,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Barry, you have people like me and other people on the commission, but I don't have the ability to reach out to the people that Barry did.

138
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:43,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gets a good part of the credit for this.

139
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:51,003
[SPEAKER_05]: With his name and reputation, he was able to go out there and make those calls that people like me just can't make or ever gonna make.

140
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:55,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanna thank Barry personally for all the work that he's done in the community.

141
00:12:57,432 --> 00:13:12,219
[SPEAKER_05]: The library is planning, hopefully, some type of celebration in October, possibly with a tent outside in the event that things don't go.

142
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,340
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully we'll be able to do an inside event.

143
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:25,465
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is some tentative plans through Mr. Bloomberg to put a tent outside the library in the parking lot and have some kind of celebration there.

144
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:29,861
[SPEAKER_05]: for the city for that weekend, for the official grand opening of the library.

145
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:37,644
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hopefully, the scope will ease up and we'll be able to actually get into the building and actually do things in it.

146
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:38,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

147
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:40,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councilor Morell.

148
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:42,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

149
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:48,248
[SPEAKER_00]: I echo my council colleagues and just thanking Barbara Kerr, the library and the library foundation.

150
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:51,370
[SPEAKER_00]: The library on Boston Ave has been a lifeline for my family.

151
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thank you guys for

152
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:55,015
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've been able to do in that space in this time.

153
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:57,175
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been truly incredible.

154
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:04,197
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have one question, President Caraviello, for, I mean, you gave us the pledged amounts and the fundraise amounts.

155
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:07,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious what the remaining amount is that isn't accounted for.

156
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:12,300
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're still, I know donations are still coming in, but if that number is available.

157
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, can you repeat that, Council Member Rowe?

158
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:20,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the remaining amount that's not covered by donations and pledges, if we have that.

159
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,268
[SPEAKER_07]: We covered it.

160
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,292
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, we agreed to do 4 million.

161
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:30,635
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're a million above what the original fund was.

162
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:31,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

163
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:32,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

164
00:14:32,676 --> 00:14:34,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Mr. David Tedisco.

166
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:42,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he said he's all set.

167
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:44,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all set.

168
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

169
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:48,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:48,949

[SPEAKER_04]: Council paper 21326 offered by Councilor Scarpelli being resolved.

191
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:33,452
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford City Council congratulate Medford's own Bill Boyd on his recent victory to the New Hampshire State House of Representatives.

192
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:35,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

193
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:36,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

194
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:42,198
[SPEAKER_04]: William Boyd III, a close friend of most Medford residents.

195
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:44,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill and I grew up together.

196
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill was a graduate of Medford High School class of 1987.

197
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:51,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And then went on, I believe, to Boston College.

198
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:59,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's someone who loved the Mustangs and loved the Eagles just as strong.

199
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:04,244
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's so proud that he's made this move.

200
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:09,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a Method resident, grown up here, his dad's still here.

201
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,771
[SPEAKER_04]: His brother's still here.

202
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:24,129
[SPEAKER_04]: that Billy took the leap and did something very difficult, especially in this climate, and representing his constituents in Merrimack, New Hampshire.

203
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:36,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to reach out and share the great news with a leader in the class of 1987, and now a leader in the state of New Hampshire.

204
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:39,235
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to wish him luck and congratulations.

205
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

206
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

207
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:44,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

208
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:45,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

209
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:48,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on.

210
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:58,453
[SPEAKER_03]: The Boyd family has been a long established family in this community, giving back much to the city over many, many decades between Bill Boyd Sr.

211
00:16:58,513 --> 00:16:59,494
[SPEAKER_03]: and Bill Boyd Jr.

212
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,576
[SPEAKER_03]: They are a tremendous family.

213
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:07,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to congratulate him on his seat to the New Hampshire State House.

214
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe they're only a part time

215
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:20,551
[SPEAKER_03]: legislative body, but still, Mr. President, it's great to see someone with his integrity, put their hat in the ring and run for public office.

216
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:22,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to congratulate him.

217
00:17:23,953 --> 00:17:24,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

218
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:24,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor People.

219
00:17:25,114 --> 00:17:25,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

220
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

221
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:31,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up with Bill and went to high school with him as well.

222
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really nice guy.

223
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:37,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to congratulate him and wish him well on his recent election.

224
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:38,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

225
00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:39,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

226
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:40,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

227
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:41,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

228
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

229
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations to Mr. Boyd on his recent election.

230
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:57,038
[SPEAKER_04]: When you talk about the Boyd family here in Medford, you talk about a family that's really focused on service, whether that's military service or public service, the Boyd family has been willing to step up for the call.

231
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:04,599
[SPEAKER_04]: As Councilor Mack said, I do believe that the legislature in New Hampshire is a part-time legislature, but I also believe that it's an unpaid position, Mr. President.

232
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:07,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to just show you what type of person Bill Boyd is.

233
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about service and about helping people.

234
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,240
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's the type of guy he is.

235
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,722
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank Councilor Scott Paley for putting this matter on, and I endorse the proposal a whole lot.

236
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:17,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

237
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:18,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Herbies.

238
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

239
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:23,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll jump in here as well, if anyone does.

240
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:26,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I never knew Bill Boyd when he lived in Medford, but he and I are fellow Eagles.

241
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:28,085
[SPEAKER_04]: We were BC classmates.

242
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:29,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a year behind him in college.

243
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:31,565
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a dear friend of mine in college.

244
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:35,186
[SPEAKER_04]: He remains a dear friend of mine today, and I congratulate him and wish him very well.

245
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:36,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish him the absolute best.

246
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:37,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

247
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:45,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli for a Senate citation.

248
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:55,620
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli to Senate citation.

249
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

250
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:03,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

251
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:03,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

252
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

253
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:06,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

254
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

255
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:07,886
Yes.

256
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:08,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

257
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:09,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

258
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:10,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

259
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:12,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

260
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

261
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:14,189
[SPEAKER_04]: President Caraviello?

262
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:15,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

263
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:18,610
[SPEAKER_05]: 2-1, 3-2-7, offered by Councilor Marks.

264
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Verizon 5G rollout be discussed.

265
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:23,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

266
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:25,292
Thank you, Mr. President.

267
00:19:26,352 --> 00:19:27,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

268
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:37,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the opportunity to attend the third and final public hearing on April 14th of the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee.

269
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:39,595
[SPEAKER_03]: They took,

270
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:46,393
[SPEAKER_03]: total of 44 applications that were submitted by Verizon in over a three-day hearing.

271
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:51,836
[SPEAKER_03]: They adjudicated all 44, Mr. President.

272
00:19:52,796 --> 00:20:09,925
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't until the April 14th meeting, after listening to resident concerns in the Hillside, Method Square area, and in South Method, that we finally were able to

273
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:16,604
[SPEAKER_03]: get a denial from the Small Ad Hoc Cell Committee.

274
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:33,329
[SPEAKER_03]: And the denial was based on two particular Method residents who, in my opinion, did their homework and did their due diligence and presented the Small Ad Hoc Cell Committee with a number of issues and concerns.

275
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:55,795
[SPEAKER_03]: and the two sisters, in my opinion, I believe, set forth denial standards now that can be followed by other Method residents if and when Verizon or any other vendor approaches the city for more applications.

276
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,237
[SPEAKER_03]: What was presented that night, Mr. President, by

277
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:11,737
[SPEAKER_03]: the two sisters and many of this document, much of the documentation has been presented to department heads here at City Hall, the city administration, members of the city council.

278
00:21:13,158 --> 00:21:30,210
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, according to the denial reasons that were issued by the small ad hoc cell committee was the chairman, Chairman McGiven cited the interim policy 2-J, which is part of the mayor's interim policy.

279
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:47,748
[SPEAKER_03]: and 2-J states description as to why the desired location is superior to other similar locations from a community perspective, including visual aspects, proximity to residential dwellings, schools, parks, or playgrounds.

280
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:54,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So the chairman, in his denial statement, mentioned the interim policy 2-J.

281
00:21:55,749 --> 00:22:14,752
[SPEAKER_03]: They also mentioned, Mr. President, which was brought up by the two sisters, Barbara Kendall and Marilyn Jordan, that they were concerned about the aesthetics of having this particular antenna within 20, 15, 20 feet of their windows in their homes.

282
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were concerned from an aesthetic standpoint.

283
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:20,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the first thing they raised, Mr. President.

284
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:27,075
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing was the proximity to their home and proximity to an open front porch where they sit.

285
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:33,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, there are no setback guidelines that the committee follows.

286
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:39,821
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently, if residents raise concerns of the proximity to their home,

287
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:48,042
[SPEAKER_03]: and the proximity to where they sit, whether it's an open front porch, whether it's stairs, you may sit in your stairs like I do.

288
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:52,246
[SPEAKER_03]: You may sit in a chair in front of your house.

289
00:22:52,706 --> 00:23:01,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So those two, three items, aesthetics, proximity to home, proximity to open front porch were mentioned.

290
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:06,057
[SPEAKER_03]: The neighbors also suggested suitable other locations.

291
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:11,128
[SPEAKER_03]: So Barbara and her sister Marilyn said, what about this location?

292
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:12,568
[SPEAKER_03]: What about this pole?

293
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:13,848
[SPEAKER_03]: What about that pole?

294
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:17,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And they listed a number of surrounding poles in the area.

295
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:29,051
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that falls in line with the policy 2-J, which mentions are there other similar superior locations?

296
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:34,432
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time, Verizon said that they couldn't locate any other locations.

297
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:39,749
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the board did not see fit and ruled for denial.

298
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:56,398
[SPEAKER_03]: The two sisters also presented a petition from area residents saying that area residents were also opposed that lived on Sheridan to installing a 5G antenna at that particular location.

299
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:04,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So based on these particular denial reasons, the five that I just mentioned, aesthetics, proximity to home,

300
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: front porch, suggestions of other suitable locations, and the presentation of a petition.

301
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:13,797
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be an act of Congress.

302
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:18,782
[SPEAKER_03]: We, the undersigned, do not support 5G antenna on Expo.

303
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:19,983
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it takes.

304
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:35,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe, Mr. President, this opens up the door for other residents down the line to offer the same other standards, the same other criteria, Mr. President, why they don't want it in front of their home.

305
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:44,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And from my sitting on probably 10 to 12 hours of public hearing for that committee,

306
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:55,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard not only these two particular sisters, but a dozen other people mentioned very similar reasons over and over again.

307
00:24:57,051 --> 00:25:00,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only one that got denied was this particular petition.

308
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:07,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was another petition, I believe there were two of them, based on clearance, ADA compliant clearance.

309
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,935
[SPEAKER_03]: You need 36 inches in width,

310
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:20,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were told that all the polls were pre-examined by the city to make sure they were ADA compliant.

311
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:26,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And come to find out, maybe we missed a couple of polls, or maybe that review was still in process.

312
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:29,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But indeed, that wasn't the case, Mr. President.

313
00:25:30,932 --> 00:25:32,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to put that out there.

314
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:50,325
[SPEAKER_03]: This issue is not going away, and I think every resident, Mr. President, should be aware if this is something that they eventually receive a notice saying we're going to have a 5G in front of your house, this is the way, in my opinion, that you can combat that.

315
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:59,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I offered the suggestion last week, Mr. President, and it was ironic to hear the chairman of the committee

316
00:26:00,985 --> 00:26:17,391
[SPEAKER_03]: state that when these two sisters brought up a concern about their property value potentially being reduced because of having 5G in front of their home, the chairman immediately stated, well, he doesn't want to dispute that.

317
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:29,375
[SPEAKER_03]: However, he believes it could be the opposite, that people in the community want the 5G, want the additional access, and that's precisely what this council voted

318
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:41,416
[SPEAKER_03]: unanimously last week, saying, let's reach out to the general public, find out who's interested, and if they wish to have 5G, let's make it happen.

319
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:51,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad to hear at least the chairman recognized there may be a better approach to this whole process.

320
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:54,575
[SPEAKER_03]: then we're currently undertaking right now.

321
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:56,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want them to put that out.

322
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,936
[SPEAKER_03]: There were no formal motions tonight, Mr. President.

323
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:14,340
[SPEAKER_03]: This was just for the edification of people in the community and possibly how, when, if and when they are presented with this means that they have to arm themselves and be informed on how to fight back, Mr. President.

324
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

325
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

326
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:20,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And I for one, first of all, I want to thank Councilor Marks

327
00:27:21,246 --> 00:27:22,286
[SPEAKER_05]: really taking the lead on this.

328
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:28,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was, I sat up there in those hours of meeting with him and he was, I gotta give him credit.

329
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,808
[SPEAKER_05]: He was on top of everything.

330
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:37,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, again, I as one council, I want to thank him for taking the lead on this and really leading the chat.

331
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:40,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, Councilor Markson, thank you very much for me.

332
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:47,431
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, on the motion by Councilor Markson to receive a place on file.

333
00:27:49,248 --> 00:27:50,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Second by Councilor Scarpelli.

334
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:51,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

335
00:27:57,713 --> 00:27:58,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

336
00:27:58,794 --> 00:27:59,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

337
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:00,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

338
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:00,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

339
00:28:01,735 --> 00:28:02,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

340
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:02,956
Yes.

341
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:03,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

342
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:04,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

343
00:28:04,397 --> 00:28:04,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

344
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:05,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

345
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:07,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

346
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:07,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

347
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:08,159
[SPEAKER_04]: President Caraviello.

348
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:08,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

349
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:09,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in favor, the motion passes.

350
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, one, three, two, eight.

351
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved.

352
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:21,867
[SPEAKER_05]: by the Medford City Council that the city clerk and the city solicitor study the steps needed to allow domestic partnerships in Medford and report back to the council.

353
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:22,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears.

354
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:24,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

355
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:29,651
[SPEAKER_01]: I put this forward after seeing a request from a resident last week.

356
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:32,593
[SPEAKER_01]: They were looking to enter a domestic partnership.

357
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:36,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford currently doesn't offer that option.

358
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:42,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our neighboring communities, Boston, Somerville, and others around the state do allow domestic partnerships.

359
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:49,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I put this forward to ask the solicitor and the clerk what steps would be needed to undertake that.

360
00:28:50,108 --> 00:29:04,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the reasons behind that, I mean, I generally don't wanna judge people for what relationship form they wanna enter, but there are some people who may not want to get married, but do wanna have their partnership recognized by their municipality.

361
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:12,472
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my intent putting this forward to ask the clerk and the solicitor what the process would be to enable that action.

362
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:14,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

363
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:20,428
[SPEAKER_05]: A motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Vice President May.

364
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:21,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

365
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if I could.

366
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:24,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

367
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:26,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a question.

368
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:32,378
[SPEAKER_03]: This may not be to Councilor Bears, but maybe to the city solicitor.

369
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,861
[SPEAKER_03]: What defines domestic partnership?

370
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:38,023
[SPEAKER_05]: You wanna make that as a form of amendment?

371
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:38,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, yes.

372
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:41,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

373
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:50,322
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks.

374
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,685
[SPEAKER_04]: On that question, Mr. President, I have done some research on this.

375
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:54,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

376
00:29:54,566 --> 00:30:00,751
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Councilor Marks question, I have done some research on the topic, just for point of information.

377
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:10,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some of the criteria include sharing of living expenses, the individual responsibility for the wellbeing of the other partner's dependents,

378
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they'd be capable of entering into a contract.

379
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:18,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, they're not within a partnership with somebody else.

380
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:23,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I can tell, uh, has been some of the criteria that I've been able to dig out of these statutes.

381
00:30:24,343 --> 00:30:25,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

382
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:26,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on to the motion.

383
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:28,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

384
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:32,765
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended by, uh, uh, by Councilor Marks.

385
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:34,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears?

386
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:35,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

387
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:37,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

388
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:37,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

389
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:38,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight?

390
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:38,807
Yes.

391
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:39,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

392
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:40,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

393
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:41,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

394
00:30:42,184 --> 00:30:42,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

395
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:43,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

396
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:44,125
[SPEAKER_05]: President Caraviello?

397
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:46,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 7 in favor of the motion passes.

398
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:48,067
[SPEAKER_05]: 2-1-3-2-9, offered by Councilor Bez.

399
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:56,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council, that the administration provide revenue projections for fiscal year 2022, fiscal year 2023, fiscal year 2024, fiscal year 2025, and fiscal year 2026.

400
00:30:56,991 --> 00:30:57,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bez.

401
00:30:57,832 --> 00:30:58,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

402
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:00,493
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I put this forward is that those are the

403
00:31:09,777 --> 00:31:17,240
[SPEAKER_01]: forward facing fiscal years under which the city would be able to expend funds allocated by the American Rescue Plan Act.

404
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:38,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important for us in this year's budget to understand to the best of the administration's ability what revenue will look like within those fiscal years so that we can understand what their proposal may be for spending those funds and how they may expect to spend them over a longer period of time.

405
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:48,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very important that we use those funds to maintain city services and restore in some cases city services and school services.

406
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:53,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would help us in our deliberations to understand the long term outlook for city revenue.

407
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:54,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

408
00:31:56,837 --> 00:31:57,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

409
00:31:58,037 --> 00:32:05,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose tonight, we're going to submit the paper to ask the administration also provide a breakdown as to whether or not there any restrictions as to where these funds can be spent.

410
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:08,902
[SPEAKER_04]: you.

411
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:18,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And to Councilor Knight's point, if I may, Mr. President, the Mass Municipal Association is hosting a webinar on that specific topic.

412
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it is not.

413
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:25,016
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't find it right now, but it's this week.

414
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:29,580
[SPEAKER_01]: It is tomorrow at 10 a.m.

415
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm planning on attending that.

416
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:34,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the mayor's office goes so they can answer our questions.

417
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:36,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

418
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:43,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Bears, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

419
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:45,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

420
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:49,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears?

421
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:50,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

422
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

423
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:52,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

424
00:32:52,525 --> 00:32:53,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight?

425
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:53,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

426
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:54,365
