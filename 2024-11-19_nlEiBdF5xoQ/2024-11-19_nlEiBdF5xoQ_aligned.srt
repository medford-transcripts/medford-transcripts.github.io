9
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,401
Be it resolved, the Medford City Council be presented a library update.

10
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,262
Councilor Caravaglio.

11
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,403
Thank you, Mr. President.

12
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:22,387
Mr. President, before I give the update, I want to give a shout out to Barbara Kerr and her library staff.

13
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:39,255
While other libraries have been closed or barely doing any work, last month our library circulated 19,562 books and other materials, which is the highest since we've moved into the warehouse space.

14
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:49,219
And also, we've done 39 virtual programs with 600 people in attendance, 18 children's programs, 14 teen programs, and seven adult programs.

15
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:54,262
And we've been doing this since November, while other libraries are just starting to do now.

16
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,503
So Mr. President, I want to just give a shout out to Barbara.

17
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:03,286
I think we are probably the most successful library in the Minute Man network.

18
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:06,427
during this pandemic.

19
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:07,628
I think Barbara's on the call.

20
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:16,451
She might wanna say something before I get into where we are with the Henry Foundation.

21
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,932
Thank you for letting me come.

22
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:20,793
Do you need my name and stuff?

23
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:22,414
Yes, Ms.

24
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,594
Kerr, name and address for the record.

25
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:26,996
It's Barbara Kerr, 35 Baker Place, Newton Lower Falls.

26
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,657
We were very lucky.

27
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:44,138
basement, for those of you who've been over to Boston Avenue, it's a very awkward space in the basement of an office building, but it turned out to be perfect for a pandemic because we are pretty much the only people on that floor.

28
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:54,521
There is an exterior hallway, and we can leave materials for people to pick up on tables in the hallway, where most other libraries are having to do a whole

29
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:00,972
you schedule a drop-off and you drive up to the front and they like throw books in your car and you drive away.

30
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:09,717
And that is a very restricted volume where we basically, our volume is restricted by when we run out of plastic bags.

31
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:14,460
So we have been averaging 16,000 items in physical items a month.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,405
I did some stats this morning and we've been doing that since we reopened in May.

33
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:30,005
We started putting stuff out in the hallway at the end of May and we started doing appointments in August and computer appointments in November.

34
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:41,509
And as Rick said, there are still a lot of libraries that are not doing any kind of appointment access and who are doing very limited pickup of materials.

35
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,931
So, you know, it was an awkward place to land, but we were very lucky in the end.

36
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:51,272
So, and I do have a very good group of people because doing

37
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:56,269
direct public service has been pretty scary in the last year and they did it.

38
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:01,811
They were very, we took a lot of precautions, but they've provided very good public service.

39
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:07,353
And the children and teen programming folks realized that you could still do a craft program.

40
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:14,195
You just had to put the supplies in a bag and put that in the hall and then have a Zoom and everybody does crafts together on the Zoom.

41
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:18,457
And Zoom actually turned out to be a remarkably good platform for lectures.

42
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:21,618
We had Robert Reich, who I forget

43
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:25,488
who he was, but he was a, he's a, he's an economist or something.

44
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:25,888
I don't know.

45
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:32,332
We were, we were able to collaborate with six other libraries to have a program with him and they had 800 people on the Zoom.

46
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,535
And I think the most we've ever had at a program is a hundred.

47
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:48,262
So I think as we go forward, some of our programming will probably still be Zoom or a Zoom in-person hybrid because it's, you don't have to leave your house.

48
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,563
So it works pretty well.

49
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:53,748
He's the former Secretary of Labor, Barbara.

50
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:56,509
I knew he was that.

51
00:04:56,549 --> 00:05:00,471
I meant to look it up before I came on here and not display my ignorance.

52
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,172
However, now I'm on tape displaying my ignorance.

53
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:06,514
But my people have done a very good job.

54
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:09,635
So it's been a challenge.

55
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:12,217
But we were fortunate to land at Boston Avenue.

56
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:14,738
Thank you.

57
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:16,219
Are you going to talk about the building?

58
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:18,239
I will.

59
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,280
I'll talk about the building, Barbara.

60
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:22,405
Again, thank you, Barbara.

61
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:27,387
That's great, almost 20,000 books on a library that's barely open.

62
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:31,689
So, I just wanted to give everybody a little update.

63
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:43,455
I think most of us have taken the tour of the building, I think a couple of weeks ago, and we're looking at sometime, I think, probably September opening, give or take a little bit.

64
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,016
Probably by the end of September.

65
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:47,937
Hopefully by the end of September,

66
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,495
have it open and everything seems to be gone.

67
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:55,516
So I just want to give you a little brief update on the money raised by the foundation.

68
00:05:56,797 --> 00:06:03,739
So as of today, the foundation has total cash and pledges and gifts in the amount of $5,207,255.

69
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,680
And we also have two in-kind pledges from both Cummings and East Cambridge Savings Bank.

70
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:25,658
for their pledges, and East Cambridge and Bill Cummings also made donations on top of their in-kind pledges.

71
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:26,919
So I thank them too for both that.

72
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:36,747
And so at the moment, we have a grand total of commitments and gifts of $5,487,255.

73
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:45,033
And what I'm told, I'm hearing there's another 100,000 coming from another donor, and we may see one more coming.

74
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:47,135
But so far,

75
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:51,827
We've, the cash we've taken in is $4,278,368.

76
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:58,109
So we're just about all the money we raised is almost all here.

77
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:05,412
So again, I want to thank the people on the commission that I work with for all their work on this.

78
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:14,036
And we've also started a new campaign and I want to thank Ken Kraus and his wife Laura for

79
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:22,440
taking the lead on this and Canada's White started the Green Campaign with a $25,000 donation.

80
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,262
And I want to thank you for that.

81
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:29,966
And the objective is to sell 111 solar panels that are to be underwritten.

82
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:37,732
So as of today, the Green Campaign has already raised $58,000 and that's been pledged.

83
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,274
So I just want to thank Canada's White

84
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:56,360
but for the scientists and all the people who've donated so far up to this, and hopefully the cost from our city will be as little as possible.

85
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:57,481
Thank you.

86
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:05,926
I can.

87
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,268
Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Kelly.

88
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:15,151
First, let me thank Councilor Carriello, because I think that it was your leadership

89
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:27,334
that started this journey and say what you want, it's too big, we don't need this, this, that, the other thing, this is truly gonna be a gem in our community.

90
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:45,243
When you talk about gateways to our most important spots in our city, you're talking about driving it to Method Square and now seeing this unbelievable building that's gonna be open to our residents in so many various ways and truly being a true community

91
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,303
community facility.

92
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:52,187
So, um, Barbara, again, it takes a great leader to, to lead the way.

93
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:56,851
And Barbara's, you know, the, the only knock is Barbara doesn't actually live in Medford.

94
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:02,715
So we should actually find her a home, you know, maybe next door, you know, get her in here.

95
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:04,697
And so she's just been amazing.

96
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:06,318
And I think that her team's been amazing.

97
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:14,284
And, uh, you know, like we said, especially during the toughest times during COVID and working for recreation, I know exactly what she's talking about.

98
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:19,435
and how we can still provide a service to our constituents.

99
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:20,255
And she did that.

100
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:25,878
When you're talking about the volume of work that you've done over the most difficult times, I applaud her efforts.

101
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:43,408
And so again, I know that, I know Councilor Caviello keeps challenging us to pledge and get out there and help raise that money and lessen the burden to the taxpayers, but I appreciate all his work.

102
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,044
his efforts, so thank you.

103
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,325
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

104
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:49,765
Thank you, Mr. President.

105
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:56,047
And thanks, thank you to President Carviello for all your hard work on this project.

106
00:09:56,367 --> 00:10:12,170
I remember when you first came back from, I think it was the Mass Municipal Conference, talking about a grant for the library, and it didn't seem like it was that long ago, and here we are, where actually there's a building going up and it's in the ground,

107
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:14,438
There are a lot of great things happening there.

108
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:20,625
And thank you for all your hard work with regard to this project, with regard to everything else you do.

109
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:21,686
And thank you for the update.

110
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:26,251
It's always good to get an update to find out where we are financially with the funds coming in.

111
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:29,395
And thank you to Barbara and her staff as well.

112
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:31,357
They've done a remarkable job.

113
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,413
and not under the best conditions.

114
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:46,975
I know it's been a challenge the past year or so, and look forward to seeing the library open soon and all the good things and great programming that's going to come out of that.

115
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:51,116
It's going to be remarkable when all is said and done.

116
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:53,977
So thank you to Barbara and her staff.

117
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:58,798
Thank you to President Caviello, and thank you to everyone that was involved in the fundraising.

118
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:06,718
to this new project that I can cross and mark back in any spirit as well.

119
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:07,938
So thank you to everyone.

120
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:08,359
Thanks.

121
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,520
Chair recognizes Councilor Beers.

122
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,242
Thank you, Mr. President.

123
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:19,743
I'm just so excited for this building to open.

124
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:27,727
I am hopeful that by the fall, the schedules will line up and we'll be able to have an in-person event of some kind

125
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:36,045
And hopefully it can be a celebration of community, not just coming out of this pandemic, but also coming together around this great community institution.

126
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:37,405
So I'm just pumped.

127
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:41,228
I can't wait to reserve a meeting room, take out a book.

128
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:50,013
And I also just want to thank Barbara, the whole library staff, the library foundation, and the board of the library foundation.

129
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:56,197
I think it's also an amazing testament to our community that we have raised so much money to support this.

130
00:11:57,737 --> 00:12:02,179
And I got an email from Ken as well around the green campaign.

131
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:07,361
So I think that's just another community value, having solar panels on the building.

132
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:14,564
So it really, this project just speaks to, I think, so many of the wonderful things about Medford and I'm excited for this fall.

133
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:15,685
So thank you to everybody.

134
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,167
Chair recognizes Councilor Kerrio.

135
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:23,868
Thank you, Mr. President.

136
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,309
A big shell goes off very slow.

137
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:37,237
Barry, you have people like me and other people on the commission, but I don't have the ability to reach out to the people that Barry did.

138
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:43,960
And he gets a good part of the credit for this.

139
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:51,003
With his name and reputation, he was able to go out there and make those calls that people like me just can't make or ever gonna make.

140
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:55,706
So I wanna thank Barry personally for all the work that he's done in the community.

141
00:12:57,432 --> 00:13:12,219
The library is planning, hopefully, some type of celebration in October, possibly with a tent outside in the event that things don't go.

142
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,340
But hopefully we'll be able to do an inside event.

143
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:25,465
But there is some tentative plans through Mr. Bloomberg to put a tent outside the library in the parking lot and have some kind of celebration there.

144
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:29,861
for the city for that weekend, for the official grand opening of the library.

145
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:37,644
So, hopefully, the scope will ease up and we'll be able to actually get into the building and actually do things in it.

146
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:38,244
So thank you.

147
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:40,925
Chair recognizes Councilor Morrell.

148
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:42,626
Thank you, Mr. President.

149
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:48,248
I echo my council colleagues and just thanking Barbara Kerr, the library and the library foundation.

150
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:51,370
The library on Boston Ave has been a lifeline for my family.

151
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,290
So I thank you guys for

152
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:55,015
what you've been able to do in that space in this time.

153
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:57,175
It's been truly incredible.

154
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:04,197
I just have one question, President Caravaglia, for, I mean, you gave us the pledged amounts and the fundraise amounts.

155
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:07,698
I'm just curious what the remaining amount is that isn't accounted for.

156
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:12,300
I know we're still, I know donations are still coming in, but if that number is available.

157
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,401
I'm sorry, can you repeat that, Council Member Rowe?

158
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:20,002
Just the remaining amount that's not covered by donations and pledges, if we have that.

159
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,268
We covered it.

160
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,292
It was, we agreed to do 4 million.

161
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:30,635
So we're a million above what the original fund was.

162
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:31,375
Yep.

163
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:32,336
Great.

164
00:14:32,676 --> 00:14:34,978
Thank you.

165
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,162
Chair recognizes Mr. David Tedisco.

166
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:42,764
Oh, he said he's all set.

167
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:44,285
I'm all set.

168
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,006
Sorry about that.

169
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:48,529
Sure.

170
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:48,949
It's a motion.

171
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:53,732
Motion received in place on file.

172
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:59,514
Motion of Councilor Scarpelli to receive in place on file, seconded by Councilor Falco, thirded by Councilor Behrs.

173
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:01,395
City Clerk, please call the roll.

174
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:05,836
Councilor Behrs.

175
00:15:06,276 --> 00:15:06,557
Yes.

176
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:08,237
Councilor Falco.

177
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:08,537
Yes.

178
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:09,438
Councilor Marks.

179
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:10,478
Yes.

180
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:11,338
Councilor Morrell.

181
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:11,979
Yes.

182
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,599
Councilor Scarpelli.

183
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:14,139
Yes.

184
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,540
President Caraballo.

185
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:15,820
Yes.

186
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,881
Vice President Knight.

187
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,301
Yes.

188
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:19,922
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

189
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:20,622
The motion passes.

190
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:25,427
Council paper 21326 offered by Councilor Scarpelli being resolved.

191
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:33,452
The Medford City Council congratulate Medford's own Bill Boyd on his recent victory to the New Hampshire State House of Representatives.

192
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:35,113
Councilor Scarpelli.

193
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:36,554
Thank you, Mr. President.

194
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:42,198
William Boyd III, a close friend of most Medford residents.

195
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:44,300
Bill and I grew up together.

196
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,901
Bill was a graduate of Medford High School class of 1987.

197
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:51,350
And then went on, I believe, to Boston College.

198
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:59,319
And he's someone who loved the Mustangs and loved the Eagles just as strong.

199
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:04,244
So it's so proud that he's made this move.

200
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:09,269
And as a Method resident, grown up here, his dad's still here.

201
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,771
His brother's still here.

202
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:24,129
that Billy took the leap and did something very difficult, especially in this climate, and representing his constituents in Merrimack, New Hampshire.

203
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:36,114
I just wanted to reach out and share the great news with a leader in the class of 1987, and now a leader in the state of New Hampshire.

204
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:39,235
So I just wanted to wish him luck and congratulations.

205
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,220
Thank you.

206
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,341
Mr. President.

207
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:44,763
Councilor Max.

208
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:45,504
Thank you, Mr. President.

209
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:48,106
I want to thank Councilor Scott Pelley for putting this on.

210
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:58,453
The Boyd family has been a long established family in this community, giving back much to the city over many, many decades between Bill Boyd Sr.

211
00:16:58,513 --> 00:16:59,494
and Bill Boyd Jr.

212
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,576
They are a tremendous family.

213
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:07,560
I want to congratulate him on his seat to the New Hampshire State House.

214
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,742
I believe they're only a part time

215
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:20,551
legislative body, but still, Mr. President, it's great to see someone with his integrity, put their hat in the ring and run for public office.

216
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:22,392
And I just want to congratulate him.

217
00:17:23,953 --> 00:17:24,273
Thank you.

218
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:24,954
Councilor People.

219
00:17:25,114 --> 00:17:25,894
Thank you, Mr. President.

220
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,296
I also want to thank Councilor Scott Kelly for bringing this forward.

221
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:31,217
I grew up with Bill and went to high school with him as well.

222
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,218
Really, really nice guy.

223
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:37,501
And I just wanted to congratulate him and wish him well on his recent election.

224
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:38,261
Thank you.

225
00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:39,002
Thank you.

226
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:40,554
Councilor Knight.

227
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:41,654
Vice President Knight.

228
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,015
Mr. President, thank you very much.

229
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,015
Congratulations to Mr. Boyd on his recent election.

230
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:57,038
When you talk about the Boyd family here in Medford, you talk about a family that's really focused on service, whether that's military service or public service, the Boyd family has been willing to step up for the call.

231
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:04,599
As Councilor Mack said, I do believe that the legislature in New Hampshire is a part-time legislature, but I also believe that it's an unpaid position, Mr. President.

232
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:07,200
I want to just show you what type of person Bill Boyd is.

233
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,800
It's about service and about helping people.

234
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,240
and that's the type of guy he is.

235
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,722
So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank Councilor Scott Paley for putting this matter on, and I endorse the proposal a whole lot.

236
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:17,302
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

237
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:18,582
Clerk Herbies.

238
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,383
Thank you, Mr. President.

239
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:23,063
I'll jump in here as well, if anyone does.

240
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:26,984
I never knew Bill Boyd when he lived in Medford, but he and I are fellow Eagles.

241
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:28,085
We were BC classmates.

242
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:29,405
I was a year behind him in college.

243
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:31,565
He was a dear friend of mine in college.

244
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:35,186
He remains a dear friend of mine today, and I congratulate him and wish him very well.

245
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:36,367
I wish him the absolute best.

246
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:37,887
Thank you very much.

247
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:45,035
Okay, as amended by Councilor Scott Pelley for a Senate citation.

248
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:55,620
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Scott Pelley to Senate citation.

249
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,281
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

250
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:03,004
Councilor Behrs.

251
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:03,744
Yes.

252
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,085
Councilor Falcone.

253
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:06,365
Yes.

254
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,346
Vice President Knight.

255
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:07,886
Yes.

256
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:08,706
Councilor Marks.

257
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:09,287
Yes.

258
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:10,808
Yes.

259
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:12,668
Councilor Scarpelli?

260
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,289
Yes.

261
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:14,189
President Caravaglia?

262
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:15,949
Yes, seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

263
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:18,610
2-1, 3-2-7, offered by Councilor Marks.

264
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,931
Be it resolved that the Verizon 5G rollout be discussed.

265
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:23,991
Councilor Marks?

266
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:25,292
Thank you, Mr. President.

267
00:19:26,352 --> 00:19:27,312
Thank you, Mr. President.

268
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:37,334
I had the opportunity to attend the third and final public hearing on April 14th of the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee.

269
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:39,595
They took,

270
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:46,393
total of 44 applications that were submitted by Verizon in over a three-day hearing.

271
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:51,836
They adjudicated all 44, Mr. President.

272
00:19:52,796 --> 00:20:09,925
It wasn't until the April 14th meeting, after listening to resident concerns in the Hillside, Method Square area, and in South Method, that we finally were able to

273
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:16,604
get a denial from the Small Ad Hoc Cell Committee.

274
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:33,329
And the denial was based on two particular Method residents who, in my opinion, did their homework and did their due diligence and presented the Small Ad Hoc Cell Committee with a number of issues and concerns.

275
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:55,795
and the two sisters, in my opinion, I believe, set forth denial standards now that can be followed by other Method residents if and when Verizon or any other vendor approaches the city for more applications.

276
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,237
What was presented that night, Mr. President, by

277
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:11,737
the two sisters and many of this document, much of the documentation has been presented to department heads here at City Hall, the city administration, members of the city council.

278
00:21:13,158 --> 00:21:30,210
But the, according to the denial reasons that were issued by the small ad hoc cell committee was the chairman, Chairman McGiven cited the interim policy 2-J, which is part of the mayor's interim policy.

279
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:47,748
and 2-J states description as to why the desired location is superior to other similar locations from a community perspective, including visual aspects, proximity to residential dwellings, schools, parks, or playgrounds.

280
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:54,508
So the chairman, in his denial statement, mentioned the interim policy 2-J.

281
00:21:55,749 --> 00:22:14,752
They also mentioned, Mr. President, which was brought up by the two sisters, Barbara Kendall and Marilyn Jordan, that they were concerned about the aesthetics of having this particular antenna within 20, 15, 20 feet of their windows in their homes.

282
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,773
And they were concerned from an aesthetic standpoint.

283
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:20,432
So that was the first thing they raised, Mr. President.

284
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:27,075
The other thing was the proximity to their home and proximity to an open front porch where they sit.

285
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:33,998
And right now, there are no setback guidelines that the committee follows.

286
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:39,821
But apparently, if residents raise concerns of the proximity to their home,

287
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:48,042
and the proximity to where they sit, whether it's an open front porch, whether it's stairs, you may sit in your stairs like I do.

288
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:52,246
You may sit in a chair in front of your house.

289
00:22:52,706 --> 00:23:01,013
So those two, three items, aesthetics, proximity to home, proximity to open front porch were mentioned.

290
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:06,057
The neighbors also suggested suitable other locations.

291
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:11,128
So Barbara and her sister Marilyn said, what about this location?

292
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:12,568
What about this pole?

293
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:13,848
What about that pole?

294
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:17,429
And they listed a number of surrounding poles in the area.

295
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:29,051
And I think that falls in line with the policy 2-J, which mentions are there other similar superior locations?

296
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:34,432
And at the time, Verizon said that they couldn't locate any other locations.

297
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:39,749
However, the board did not see fit and ruled for denial.

298
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:56,398
The two sisters also presented a petition from area residents saying that area residents were also opposed that lived on Sheridan to installing a 5G antenna at that particular location.

299
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:04,003
So based on these particular denial reasons, the five that I just mentioned, aesthetics, proximity to home,

300
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:11,495
front porch, suggestions of other suitable locations, and the presentation of a petition.

301
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:13,797
It doesn't have to be an act of Congress.

302
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:18,782
We, the undersigned, do not support 5G antenna on Expo.

303
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:19,983
That's all it takes.

304
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:35,709
I believe, Mr. President, this opens up the door for other residents down the line to offer the same other standards, the same other criteria, Mr. President, why they don't want it in front of their home.

305
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:44,112
And from my sitting on probably 10 to 12 hours of public hearing for that committee,

306
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:55,830
I heard not only these two particular sisters, but a dozen other people mentioned very similar reasons over and over again.

307
00:24:57,051 --> 00:25:00,172
And the only one that got denied was this particular petition.

308
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:07,934
And there was another petition, I believe there were two of them, based on clearance, ADA compliant clearance.

309
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,935
You need 36 inches in width,

310
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:20,097
And we were told that all the polls were pre-examined by the city to make sure they were ADA compliant.

311
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:26,921
And come to find out, maybe we missed a couple of polls, or maybe that review was still in process.

312
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:29,963
But indeed, that wasn't the case, Mr. President.

313
00:25:30,932 --> 00:25:32,894
So I just want to put that out there.

314
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:50,325
This issue is not going away, and I think every resident, Mr. President, should be aware if this is something that they eventually receive a notice saying we're going to have a 5G in front of your house, this is the way, in my opinion, that you can combat that.

315
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:59,831
I offered the suggestion last week, Mr. President, and it was ironic to hear the chairman of the committee

316
00:26:00,985 --> 00:26:17,391
state that when these two sisters brought up a concern about their property value potentially being reduced because of having 5G in front of their home, the chairman immediately stated, well, he doesn't want to dispute that.

317
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:29,375
However, he believes it could be the opposite, that people in the community want the 5G, want the additional access, and that's precisely what this council voted

318
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:41,416
unanimously last week, saying, let's reach out to the general public, find out who's interested, and if they wish to have 5G, let's make it happen.

319
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:51,463
So I'm glad to hear at least the chairman recognized there may be a better approach to this whole process.

320
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:54,575
then we're currently undertaking right now.

321
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:56,235
So I just want them to put that out.

322
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,936
There were no formal motions tonight, Mr. President.

323
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:14,340
This was just for the edification of people in the community and possibly how, when, if and when they are presented with this means that they have to arm themselves and be informed on how to fight back, Mr. President.

324
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,060
Thank you.

325
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,401
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

326
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:20,482
And I for one, first of all, I want to thank Councilor Marks

327
00:27:21,246 --> 00:27:22,286
really taking the lead on this.

328
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:28,427
I mean, I was, I sat up there in those hours of meeting with him and he was, I gotta give him credit.

329
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,808
He was on top of everything.

330
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:37,529
And I say, again, I as one council, I want to thank him for taking the lead on this and really leading the chat.

331
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:40,290
So again, Councilor Moxon, thank you very much for me.

332
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:47,431
All right, on the motion by Councilor Moxon to receive a place on file.

333
00:27:49,248 --> 00:27:50,469
Second by Councilor Scarpelli.

334
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:51,629
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

335
00:27:57,713 --> 00:27:58,313
Councilor Behrs.

336
00:27:58,794 --> 00:27:59,034
Yes.

337
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:00,875
Councilor Fevella.

338
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:00,955
Yes.

339
00:28:01,735 --> 00:28:02,436
Vice President Knight.

340
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:02,956
Yes.

341
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:03,697
Councilor Marks.

342
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:04,157
Yes.

343
00:28:04,397 --> 00:28:04,957
Councilor Morrell.

344
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:05,578
Yes.

345
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:07,039
Councilor Scarpelli.

346
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:07,379
Yes.

347
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:08,159
President Kerrio.

348
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:08,319
Yes.

349
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:09,640
Seven in favor, the motion passes.

350
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,661
Two, one, three, two, eight.

351
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,642
Offered by Councilor Behrs, be it resolved.

352
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:21,867
by the Memphis City Council that the city clerk and the city solicitor study the steps needed to allow domestic partnerships in Medford and report back to the council.

353
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:22,787
Councilor Baez.

354
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:24,669
Thank you, Mr. President.

355
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:29,651
I put this forward after seeing a request from a resident last week.

356
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:32,593
They were looking to enter a domestic partnership.

357
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:36,675
Medford currently doesn't offer that option.

358
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:42,579
Some of our neighboring communities, Boston, Somerville, and others around the state do allow domestic partnerships.

359
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:49,388
I put this forward to ask the solicitor and the clerk what steps would be needed to undertake that.

360
00:28:50,108 --> 00:29:04,171
And some of the reasons behind that, I mean, I generally don't wanna judge people for what relationship form they wanna enter, but there are some people who may not want to get married, but do wanna have their partnership recognized by their municipality.

361
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:12,472
So that was my intent putting this forward to ask the clerk and the solicitor what the process would be to enable that action.

362
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:14,443
Thank you.

363
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:20,428
A motion by Councilor Beers, seconded by Vice President May.

364
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:21,649
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

365
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,191
Mr. President, if I could.

366
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:24,552
Councilor Max.

367
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:26,814
I just have a question.

368
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:32,378
This may not be to Councilor Beers, but maybe to the city solicitor.

369
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,861
What defines domestic partnership?

370
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:38,023
You wanna make that as a form of amendment?

371
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:38,664
I would, yes.

372
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:41,446
Okay.

373
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:50,322
On the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Mox.

374
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,685
On that question, Mr. President, I have done some research on this.

375
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:54,246
Vice President Knight.

376
00:29:54,566 --> 00:30:00,751
On the Councilor Mox question, I have done some research on the topic, just for point of information.

377
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:10,620
I think some of the criteria include sharing of living expenses, the individual responsibility for the wellbeing of the other partner's dependents,

378
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,561
Um, they'd be capable of entering into a contract.

379
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:18,982
Um, and, uh, they're not within a partnership with somebody else.

380
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:23,563
And what I can tell, uh, has been some of the criteria that I've been able to dig out of these statutes.

381
00:30:24,343 --> 00:30:25,143
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

382
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:26,444
Okay, on to the motion.

383
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:28,244
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

384
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:32,765
As amended by, uh, uh, by Councilor Marks.

385
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:34,506
Councilor Behrs?

386
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:35,446
Yes.

387
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:37,026
Councilor Fevella?

388
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:37,286
Yes.

389
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:38,486
Vice President Knight?

390
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:38,807
Yes.

391
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:39,627
Councilor Marks?

392
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:40,007
Yes.

393
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:41,404
Yes.

394
00:30:42,184 --> 00:30:42,905
Councilor Scarpelli?

395
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:43,245
Yes.

396
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:44,125
President Caravaglia?

397
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:46,887
Yes, 7 in favor of the motion passes.

398
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:48,067
2-1-3-2-9, offered by Councilor Bez.

399
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:56,951
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council, that the administration provide revenue projections for fiscal year 2022, fiscal year 2023, fiscal year 2024, fiscal year 2025, and fiscal year 2026.

400
00:30:56,991 --> 00:30:57,812
Councilor Bez.

401
00:30:57,832 --> 00:30:58,612
Thank you, Mr. President.

402
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:00,493
The reason I put this forward is that those are the

403
00:31:09,777 --> 00:31:17,240
forward facing fiscal years under which the city would be able to expend funds allocated by the American Rescue Plan Act.

404
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:38,230
I think it's important for us in this year's budget to understand to the best of the administration's ability what revenue will look like within those fiscal years so that we can understand what their proposal may be for spending those funds and how they may expect to spend them over a longer period of time.

405
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:48,115
I think it's very important that we use those funds to maintain city services and restore in some cases city services and school services.

406
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:53,976
And I think it would help us in our deliberations to understand the long term outlook for city revenue.

407
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:54,816
Thank you.

408
00:31:56,837 --> 00:31:57,597
Thank you.

409
00:31:58,037 --> 00:32:05,319
I suppose tonight, we're going to submit the paper to ask the administration also provide a breakdown as to whether or not there any restrictions as to where these funds can be spent.

410
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:08,902
you.

411
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:18,410
And to Councilor Knight's point, if I may, Mr President, the Mass Municipal Association is hosting a webinar on that specific topic.

412
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,253
I believe it is not.

413
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:25,016
I can't find it right now, but it's this week.

414
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:29,580
It is tomorrow at 10 a.m.

415
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,081
So I'm planning on attending that.

416
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:34,444
I hope the mayor's office goes so they can answer our questions.

417
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:36,077
Thank you.

418
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:43,641
Okay, on the motion by Councilor Beers, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

419
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:45,521
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

420
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:49,443
Councilor Beers?

421
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:50,264
Yes.

422
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,004
Councilor Falco?

423
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:52,284
Yes.

424
00:32:52,525 --> 00:32:53,245
Vice President Knight?

425
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:53,585
Yes.

426
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:54,365
Councilor Marks?

427
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:54,866
Yes.

428
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:55,666
Councilor Morrell?

429
00:32:55,926 --> 00:32:56,146
Yes.

430
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:57,967
Yes.

431
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:00,728
Yes, seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

432
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:04,650
But public participation, we have anybody that wants to speak in public participation?

433
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:18,005
Mr. President, I know if we don't have anybody, I know that I did, I was a constituent did reach out via email asking the city administration a question.

434
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:20,506
There's no one here would like to ask that question.

435
00:33:21,286 --> 00:33:21,606
Okay.

436
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:35,072
Councilor Scott has a question on the public participation through a constituent that the constituent is asking that the POW flag that

437
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:39,064
should be flying in front of the City Hall isn't there.

438
00:33:39,304 --> 00:33:43,666
I haven't noticed it, but if it isn't, could we get the report live?

439
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:44,787
Thank you.

440
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:47,128
Thank you, Councilor Scapello.

441
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:48,709
Mr. President, if I may.

442
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,010
Councilor Best.

443
00:33:52,030 --> 00:34:00,575
We also received a message from a resident to the city administration asking if there was going to be a formal response to the

444
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:07,523
globe report of an attack, an anti Asian attack in the city.

445
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:11,645
So I would just like that reflected as well that a resident did reach out to us about that.

446
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:13,905
Thank you.

447
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:16,226
Okay.

448
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:20,088
Mr. President, a resident reached out to me about a pothole, but I'll take care of that.

449
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:21,168
I don't need that in the record.

450
00:34:22,148 --> 00:34:28,271
Um, records will come past the council of this.

451
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:31,532
Mr. President, I would like to table the records for one week.

452
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,401
The motion by Councilor Behrs, to table the records for one week.

453
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:39,621

468
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:55,644
Yes, seven years affirmative, motion passes.

469
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:59,545
Motion to adjourn by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.
