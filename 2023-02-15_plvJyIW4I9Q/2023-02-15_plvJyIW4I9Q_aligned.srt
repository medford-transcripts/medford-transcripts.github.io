Hi, I'm Mrs. Miller.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,752
I teach programming and web development.

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,597
I think the highlights of the shop include what the name implies.

4
00:00:07,677 --> 00:00:13,460
We learn to program, we make apps, we make programs, we do web development, we create websites.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,861
We are a creating kind of shop, but we're creating with code.

6
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:25,624
What interested me originally was really just web development, when I saw that, and how you can just really control what you want to do, like through your print and all these various things.

7
00:00:26,104 --> 00:00:29,666
Now, I would say it's really just like the problem solving aspect of it.

8
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:32,927
I always like problem solving, puzzles, and really the creativity, which

9
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:35,448
many different fields of programming included.

10
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:38,270
For programming, we learned Python and Java.

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,652
Those are our two main programming languages, although we use C Sharp in Unity game development.

12
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:47,715
For web development, we learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

13
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,596
My favorite aspect is definitely the teamwork.

14
00:00:50,036 --> 00:00:54,178
All of us talk to each other, help each other out with our projects and our daily work.

15
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:58,941
I think probably the most interesting project recently has been creating the district website.

16
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:06,266
I would recommend this shop to other people because in this shop you have the best community out of any other voc class.

17
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:07,647
I can promise you that.

18
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:11,370
We have the best, most supportive teacher in the school.

19
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:18,616
After high school, I plan to work in this field in college and, you know, in the field of computer science.

20
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:22,078
Hopefully some type of coding for game development.

21
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,842
But yeah, definitely utilize the skills I find in this shop in high school and in college.

22
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:32,425
Here you can really do what you want when it comes to computers, like you can really pursue any field.

23
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:35,786
Our teacher will definitely help you excel in that field, whatever it may be.

24
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:36,867
This is the place to be.

25
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:41,389
We have a lot of fun, we try to create a great atmosphere, and I think it's a great shop.
