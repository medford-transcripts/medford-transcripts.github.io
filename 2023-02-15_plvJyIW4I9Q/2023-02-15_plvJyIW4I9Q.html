    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=0.653s">Hi,</a>  I'm Mrs. Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=1.74s">I</a>  teach programming and web development. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=4.096s">I</a>  think the highlights of the shop include what the name implies. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=7.677s">We</a>  learn to program, we make apps, we make programs, we do web development, we create websites. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=13.74s">We</a>  are a creating kind of shop, but we're creating with code.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=17.021s">What</a>  interested me originally was really just web development, when I saw that, and how you can just really control what you want to do, like through your print and all these various things. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=26.104s">Now,</a>  I would say it's really just like the problem solving aspect of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=29.766s">I</a>  always like problem solving, puzzles, and really the creativity, which <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=33.747s">many</a>  different fields of programming included.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=35.508s">For</a>  programming, we learned Python and Java. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=38.29s">Those</a>  are our two main programming languages, although we use C Sharp in Unity game development. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=43.152s">For</a>  web development, we learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=47.915s">My</a>  favorite aspect is definitely the teamwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=50.036s">All</a>  of us talk to each other, help each other out with our projects and our daily work.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=54.358s">I</a>  think probably the most interesting project recently has been creating the district website.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=59.241s">I</a>  would recommend this shop to other people because in this shop you have the best community out of any other voc class. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=66.747s">I</a>  can promise you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=67.868s">We</a>  have the best, most supportive teacher in the school.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=72.011s">After</a>  high school, I plan to work in this field in college and, you know, in the field of computer science. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=79.396s">Hopefully</a>  some type of coding for game development. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=82.118s">But</a>  yeah, definitely utilize the skills I find in this shop in high school and in college.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=87.082s">Here</a>  you can really do what you want when it comes to computers, like you can really pursue any field. <a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=92.445s">Our</a>  teacher will definitely help you excel in that field, whatever it may be.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/plvJyIW4I9Q&t=95.866s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  This is the place to be.
 We have a lot of fun, we try to create a great atmosphere, and I think it's a great shop.
