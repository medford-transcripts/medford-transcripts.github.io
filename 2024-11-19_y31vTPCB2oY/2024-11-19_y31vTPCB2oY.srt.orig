[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, great job.

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

157
00:09:58,195 --> 00:09:59,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to yield the chair.

158
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:07,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Knight, if you'd like to come up here, I know that President Caraballo is going to be presiding and he's going to be remote, but you can feel free to come up here if you'd like.

159
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:09,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice seeing you, Sylvia.

160
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:10,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye, Sylvia.

161
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:16,994
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Mr. Click, are we ready?

00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:19,836

163
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:20,137

[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

166
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:36,039

167
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,621
[SPEAKER_09]: In common form, in practice, as done normally in the past, we've transferred all papers over from one session to the next.

168
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:46,563
[SPEAKER_09]: This paper does just that, and I do it for approval and ask my council colleagues for support.

169
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:47,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Second that?

191
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:34,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council transfer all papers and committees around the table from 2020 council to the 2020 council.

[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

194
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:45,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, yes, once again, another procedural item that's been done in the past and will hopefully continue in the future to keep all our standing rules and our existing papers alive.

195
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:49,405
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask my council colleagues to vote in favor of this and I move for approval.

196
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:52,328

215

[SPEAKER_07]: With this as a public hearing, I open up to who is in favor of this petition.

223
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:49,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Attorney Abruzzese is on the call.

224
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:50,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to find him.

225
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:55,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to unmute him.

226
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Judy Abruzzi, are you in favor of this petition?

227
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:10,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm here on behalf of the petitioner and I'll make a presentation.

228
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:15,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in favor.

229
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,313
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll come back to you after.

230
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:17,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

231
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:18,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

232
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else in favor?

233
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, we close this section of the public hearing.

234
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:29,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anyone opposed to this motion?

235
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see anybody.

236
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:39,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, we close this portion of the meeting.

237
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Attorney Brzee.

238
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:50,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

239
00:14:50,847 --> 00:15:01,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Members of the Council, happy to be here this evening via Zoom on behalf of Stevens Automotive Transport, doing business as Stevens Towing.

240
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:07,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Derek Stevens, the owner and principal, is on the call as well tonight.

241
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:09,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little bit of background.

242
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:19,010
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeking a class two motor vehicle sales license for the sole purpose of being able to

243
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:25,796
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficiently and economically dispose of vehicles that have been abandoned.

244
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:34,443
[SPEAKER_01]: You may remember, it was before the council, approximately a year, year and a half ago, on behalf of the export towing, a similar situation.

245
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:47,032
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a vehicle is towed by the towing facility back to the yard and accumulates storage charges under the provisions of Mass General Laws, Chapter 255, Section 39A,

246
00:15:49,465 --> 00:16:07,490
[SPEAKER_01]: after a certain period of time, the towing company is entitled to post and advertise that vehicle for auction for the purpose of recouping the accumulated towing and storage charges.

247
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,812
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some situations, there's actually a requirement

248
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:20,813
[SPEAKER_01]: a third party buyer, and let's assume that the vehicles accumulated storage charges of $3,500, $4,000.

249
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:24,616
[SPEAKER_01]: We may be able to, and we may in this typical situation, maybe we get a buyer at $3,000.

250
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:30,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in order for us to transfer a title, we first have to get a,

251
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:42,156
[SPEAKER_01]: a title from the registry.

252
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:47,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're not, if we don't hold a dealer's license, we have to pay a sales tax to do that.

253
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:54,590
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is strictly a paper transaction within the facility.

254
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:59,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no, this is not a typical secondhand transaction.

255
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,249
[SPEAKER_01]: automobile facility.

256
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be no, as you've seen now, you've had the experience of export.

257
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:11,297
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see any vehicles being advertised for sale.

258
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:12,639
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no used car lot.

259
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:19,345
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also all within, as I say, strictly a inter-office transaction.

260
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:22,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Attorney Dabrowski.

261
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:25,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone from the council want to speak to this?

262
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President?

263
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:28,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Layton.

264
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

265
00:17:30,443 --> 00:17:31,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I, for one, don't have a problem with this.

266
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:38,644
[SPEAKER_09]: As Attorney Abruzzese has noted in the past, this is something that we've done as a past practice with export towing.

267
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,265
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't see export towing looking like a used car lot.

268
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:49,646
[SPEAKER_09]: As Attorney Abruzzese has stated, this is nothing more than merely a certification so a paper transaction can take place.

269
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:56,208
[SPEAKER_09]: That coupled with the fact that Stevens Towing has been in business now for as long as I can remember here in the city of Medford.

270
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:57,488
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've been a great neighbor.

271
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,271
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been a great contributor to our community, and they're a valuable asset.

272
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,152
[SPEAKER_09]: They provide jobs, they pay a living wage here in the city of Medford.

273
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:08,935
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can help a business during these times, I think we should do it, Mr. President.

274
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:11,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm wholeheartedly in favor of this paper, and I move for approval.

275
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:15,478
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Vice President Knight.

276
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Second, Mr. President.

277
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Second by Councilor Scarpelli.

278
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:20,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

279
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

280
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:23,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Max.

281
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:24,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

282
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:35,092
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to concur with my colleague, Vice President Knight, that Stevens Towing has been a long recognized good business in this community.

283
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:41,095
[SPEAKER_11]: They're always willing to step forward in the time of need when the city calls upon them.

284
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:46,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And this seems to me just a way of streamlining their business.

285
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:50,660
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also have no problem with this, so I would move approval as well.

286
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:52,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Baez.

287
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:55,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

288
00:18:55,238 --> 00:19:03,463
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Attorney Abruzzese already answered this pretty succinctly, but I just want to confirm, there wouldn't be anybody coming to browse or looking at any inventory or anything like that, right?

289
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:05,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.

290
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:05,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

291
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:06,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

292
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:08,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any further questions?

293
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, I'll move the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

294
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:15,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

295
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:17,872
[SPEAKER_07]: By Councilor Scott Kelly.

296
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

297
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:23,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Behrs.

298
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:24,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

299
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

300
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

301
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Knight.

302
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:27,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

303
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:28,772

304
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:29,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

305
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:30,634
Councilor Morrell.

306
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:31,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

307
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:32,014
Councilor Skargel.

308
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:32,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

309
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:33,355
President Keohokalole.

310
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:35,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

311
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:36,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

312
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:38,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, Derek Stephens.

313
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:38,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

314
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you again.

315
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

316
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:41,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

317
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Attorney Dabrowski.

318
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:54,053
[SPEAKER_07]: 2-1-0-0-5, authorized by Vice President Knight, whereas the majority of the finalized construction of the GLX Ball Square Station lies within the City of Medford.

319
00:19:54,714 --> 00:20:02,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford City Council requested that the MBTA consider renaming the GLX Ball Square Station to the Ball Square

320
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:04,444
[SPEAKER_07]: South Medford Station.

321
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:05,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

322
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

323
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:15,156
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that came up through some discussions with residents in the community based upon the fact that the majority of the station is going to be located in the City of Medford.

324
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:23,185
[SPEAKER_09]: The majority of the pedestrian paths and access roads are going to be located in the City of Medford, but yet the City of Medford is not getting any recognition or credit.

325
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:30,149
[SPEAKER_09]: with delivering the Green Line to the city of Medford, or extending the Green Line and the Green Line Extension Project, I should say, Mr. President.

326
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:39,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I thought this might be something that we could do to boost some community pride and also bring some recognition to the South Medford neighborhood that's been neglected for a number of years.

327
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:42,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

328
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:45,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

329
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:51,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President?

330
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Rodriguez, you had your hand up.

331
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:58,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

332
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:00,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight for bringing it forward.

333
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:05,440
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that the administration has been in active discussions with MassDOT and Secretary Pollack's office on.

334
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are making slow but steady progress and we can update the council as we get more information.

335
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:12,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Chief of Staff.

336
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:14,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

337
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:16,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morrell.

338
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:17,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:24,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank Vice President Knight for bringing this forward because I think, in addition to this being recognition, this is really just wayfinding.

340
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:28,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's something that the city of Medford and specifically South Medford deserves.

341
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thank him for raising this and look forward to this moving forward.

342
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

343
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:35,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else?

344
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:36,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other hands up?

345
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:38,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve.

346
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:41,696

348
00:21:47,813 --> 00:21:48,894

349
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,599

00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,921

352
00:21:58,141 --> 00:21:58,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

353
00:21:58,581 --> 00:21:59,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Knight?

354
00:21:59,562 --> 00:21:59,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

355
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:00,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

356
00:22:02,244 --> 00:22:02,624

357
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:03,865

00:22:04,185 --> 00:22:04,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

359
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:05,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Stark-Teller?

360
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:05,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

361
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, affirmative motion passes.

362
00:22:09,514 --> 00:22:23,783
[SPEAKER_07]: 2-1-0-0-6 offered by Vice President Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council requests that the city administration extend a Christmas tree pickup for one additional week.

363
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:25,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

364
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:31,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, well, many of us were glad to see 2020 pass us by in the rear view mirror.

365
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:38,468
[SPEAKER_09]: There are still many of us, I'm not talking about my wife, I swear to God, that wants to keep the Christmas tree up a little longer than January 11th.

366
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:48,032
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm hoping that we can petition the administration to extend Christmas tree pickup for one additional week so that the week of the 11th and the week of the 18th, Christmas tree pickup can be conducted.

367
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:49,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

368
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:51,753
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Knight,

369
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Second by Councilor Falco.

370
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:56,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Any discussion?

371
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

372
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:04,163

373

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

374
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:06,403

00:23:07,044 --> 00:23:07,764

00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:08,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

378
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:09,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

379
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:09,804
Yes.

380
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:10,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morrell?

381
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:10,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

382
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:12,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpell?

383
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:12,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

384
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:16,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, motion passes.

385
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:33,438
[SPEAKER_07]: 2-1-007, offered by Vice President Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence in memory of Governor's Counselor Michael J. Callahan, a dedicated public servant who passed on January 6, 2011, following five decades of public service to the people of Memphis.

386
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:39,683
[SPEAKER_07]: and be it further resolved that the January 5th, 2020 Method City Council meeting be dedicated in his memory.

387
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:40,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

388
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:42,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

389
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:47,570
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you who don't know Michael Callahan, Michael Callahan was a resident of Medford lifelong.

390
00:23:47,891 --> 00:23:50,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Born and raised in the Fulton Heights on Saunders Street.

391
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:54,116
[SPEAKER_09]: He was someone who worked in government tirelessly for his whole career.

392
00:23:55,217 --> 00:24:02,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Senator Bullock, Senator McKenna as the Special Assistant to the Commissioner of Racing, the Chief Steward of the National Association of Government Employees.

393
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:12,395
[SPEAKER_09]: In 1978, he became the founding member of the Medford Consumer Commission, a commission that still exists in this community today that we fund through a line item in our budget every year.

394
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:15,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Michael Callahan was elected to the Governor's Council.

395
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,925
[SPEAKER_09]: He served 12 years as our Governor's Councilor representing the City of Medford.

396
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:27,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Upon the conclusion of Michael's 12th year, he passed away on the day that his successor was sworn in.

397
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:28,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Michael never got

398
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:31,514
[SPEAKER_09]: an opportunity or a chance to enjoy his retirement.

399
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:38,299
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think what Michael really enjoyed more than anything was the 50 years of public service that he was able to put in to the residents of this community.

400
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,900
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a Vietnam veteran.

401
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:48,647
[SPEAKER_09]: He was the author of the Veterans Buyback Bill, which allowed public servants in the police and fire department to buy back military time to put it towards a creditable service.

402
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,489
[SPEAKER_09]: He was someone that was a forward thinker.

403
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,832
[SPEAKER_09]: And most importantly, he is the man that saved Wrights Pond from development.

404
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Local legends would say that back in the early 80s,

405
00:24:58,835 --> 00:25:13,781
[SPEAKER_09]: A developer came in looking to purchase large portions of land around Wrights Pond to build condominium developments and Michael Callahan led the charge to start that development and here we are some years later and we still have Wrights Pond as a beautiful natural asset to the residents here in this community.

406
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:19,624
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go up to Wrights Pond tomorrow, you'll see the Michael Callahan monument up there that's been kept in great shape.

407
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:21,844
[SPEAKER_09]: by our staff at the DPW.

408
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:29,366
[SPEAKER_09]: And annually, I take the time to remember my friend, Michael, a mentor of mine, someone who I sadly miss.

409
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:35,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support me in remembering Michael and the fine work that he did for the people of the city of Medford.

410
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:37,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

411
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:39,227
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight.

412
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:42,808

416
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:47,569

[SPEAKER_07]: None.

418
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:55,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, on the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

419
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:56,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

420
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:58,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Behrs?

421
00:25:59,209 --> 00:25:59,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

422
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:00,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco?

423
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

424
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:02,451

00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:06,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

431
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:06,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

432
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:08,034
[SPEAKER_05]: President Caravaglia?

433
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:08,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

434
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:09,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative.

435
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:10,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

436
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:13,998
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could turn the chair over to Vice President Knight.

437
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:21,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper 21008 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

438
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:31,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have MassDOT return to Mystic Avenue in the spring to repaint and re-stripe the areas that are already in place and wearing off.

439
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:33,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

440
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

441
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,898
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a project that we just got through doing about a month ago.

442
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:46,862
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you drive by there, the paint is already wearing off on the crosswalks and some of the siding there.

443
00:26:48,729 --> 00:26:52,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Come the spring, I'd hate to see it after our DPW guys go out there and do it.

444
00:26:53,611 --> 00:27:02,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would ask that the administration have the DOT come back in the spring and repaint that whole area on Mystic Avenue that they just recently painted.

445
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:06,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you paint it in the middle of the winter, the paint's not gonna last too long.

446
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:14,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

447
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:17,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I see Councilor Marks' light on?

448
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a reflection?

449
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:19,341
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

450
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:19,921
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

451
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:28,665
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

452
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:30,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Will the clerk please call the roll.

453
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to call you last.

454
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:37,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Behrs.

455
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:40,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

456
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:43,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

457
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:46,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

458
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:46,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

459
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:48,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

460
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:50,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

461
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:50,954
Yes.

462
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:51,074
Yes.

463
00:27:51,094 --> 00:27:51,434
Paper two one.

464
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:04,789
[SPEAKER_09]: 009 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

465
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:14,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved the Medford City Council have the administration report back to the council the status of the 40B developments currently on appeal and the current cost for legal action.

466
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:15,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

467
00:28:15,934 --> 00:28:16,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

468
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:20,897
[SPEAKER_07]: President, we have these 40Bs that are currently on appeal here.

469
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:40,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And a couple of weeks ago, our own OCP director had stated that we are under the affordable number needed to stop these, and we are also not close to the glam number to stop these.

470
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:46,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, tonight we talked about affordable housing all year long.

471
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:48,606
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been talking about affordable housing, affordable housing.

472
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:56,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, unfortunately, right now this is our only avenue to get affordable housing in the city of Medford.

473
00:28:57,293 --> 00:29:01,637
[SPEAKER_07]: And are we fighting a fight that we can't win here?

474
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:07,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know we had Judy Barrett in the picture for a while there.

475
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:09,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if she's still working for the city.

476
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:17,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I know she was a master at negotiating friendly 40 B's, but I don't know where we are now.

477
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:24,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, are we just, I hate to see us continue spending money on legal costs on fights that we can't win.

478
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:27,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Mr. Rodriguez is on the call here.

479
00:29:28,272 --> 00:29:30,913
[SPEAKER_07]: If he'd like to give an opinion on where we stand on this.

480
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Rodriguez, do you have any comment on behalf of the administration?

481
00:29:39,523 --> 00:29:40,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

482
00:29:40,264 --> 00:29:41,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

483
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:48,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So all three projects that were presented by 40B are currently before the Housing Appeals Committee.

484
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,192
[SPEAKER_04]: The Board of Appeals asserted Safe Harbor under the GLAM analysis that was performed.

485
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:58,753
[SPEAKER_04]: last spring that did put us over the required number.

486
00:29:59,153 --> 00:29:59,894
[SPEAKER_04]: That number was challenged.

487
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:08,077
[SPEAKER_04]: It's working its way through the process through the HAC now, but we are always open to discussions with those developers as well.

488
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:10,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So that process is ongoing.

489
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,180
[SPEAKER_04]: The HAC process is pretty slow.

490
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can double check with Alicia and the Board of Appeals to see exactly where we are with the process in an estimated time.

491
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:25,114
[SPEAKER_07]: have we begun any negotiation with the three groups?

492
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:28,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be hesitant to discuss that in any detail.

493
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can say that conversations have taken place.

494
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:32,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

495
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:39,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, again, I say, I know, you know, the numbers aren't working out in our favor.

496
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:47,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the numbers that the state came back with and the numbers that the city have, we're not even in the same ballpark with this.

497
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:48,787
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd hate to see us,

498
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:54,495
[SPEAKER_07]: just spin our wheels here and spend money on legal costs that aren't going anywhere.

499
00:30:55,455 --> 00:31:00,097
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're losing tax dollars on these projects also.

500
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:12,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, as soon as one of them goes up, we gain a million dollars in tax revenue, not counting the building payment fee on each building.

501
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:15,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And we help with affordable housing.

502
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:17,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know why,

503
00:31:19,132 --> 00:31:22,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the holdup is and why we want to continue to fight these.

504
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:31,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you follow the trends right now, commercial property around the Boston area is going by the wayside and it's going toward housing.

505
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the new business model is not people going back to work in the businesses.

506
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:41,224
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to see a big downturn in commercial.

507
00:31:42,044 --> 00:31:47,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hate to see these people walk out of town and leave us with properties doing nothing.

508
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:52,182
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll leave it to my other councilors for any further discussion.

509
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:54,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

510
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:57,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

511
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:01,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, President Caviello, for bringing this resolution forward.

512
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:08,697
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't really talked about 40 Bs in a while, and this is a concern, especially if legal fees are mounting.

513
00:32:09,518 --> 00:32:11,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you for bringing this forward.

514
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:21,895
[SPEAKER_02]: If the council or President Caviello, if you wouldn't mind, is it possible to amend the order of resolution to actually have the, I know you asked if I think it was the total legal costs.

515
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:37,804
[SPEAKER_02]: The current legal cost, if we could have that by actual 40B, how much we've been charged, and actually how much the city has paid to our representatives, which I believe KP Law is representing the city on each of these.

516
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:49,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we could get that broken down by property, by each 40B, how much the city has been billed and how much we've actually paid out in legal fees to KP Law or

517
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:57,135
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever legal team is representing the city in this matter.

518
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be amenable to that Councilor Falco.

519
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

520
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:05,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I hear a second?

521
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:05,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

522
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:07,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Second by Councilor Scott Pell.

523
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:12,456
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can, thank you, Mr. President.

524
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:15,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for Council President Carvell bringing this forward.

525
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:26,934
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I could, I recommend that since we haven't talked about it, and that you do hear rumblings on the streets where I've gotten a few residents come to me.

526
00:33:27,895 --> 00:33:39,038
[SPEAKER_10]: different developers looking at different areas saying, you know what, before it goes to this department or that department, we're just going to just jump everything and just go right to 40B.

527
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:40,278
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's important.

528
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:56,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to amend this, and hopefully my fellow counselors can agree that we call for a committee of the whole as soon as possible, that we get all these questions answered with all of our department heads and the city administration together so we can really

529
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,862
[SPEAKER_10]: start thinking and talking out loud about this.

530
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:04,543
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know what Councilor Caviello is saying, that this might be a losing battle.

531
00:34:04,703 --> 00:34:10,784
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what Councilor Falco is saying when we're talking about the funding that's being spent to fight this.

532
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:20,806
[SPEAKER_10]: And the biggest issue right now is you're seeing developers looking at Medford as, hey, I could come to this area and put up 12 units.

533
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:25,507
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it doesn't get approved, I'll just jump that and build 24 units and call it a 40B.

534
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:27,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we allow that.

535
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:40,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think that we need to really have a conversation with everybody at the table as soon as possible so we can get these issues out moving forward in a direction that's really protecting our neighborhood.

536
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:42,364
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Mr. President.

537
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:49,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

538
00:34:57,323 --> 00:35:00,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Have anybody that's, Councilor Marks appears.

539
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,386
[SPEAKER_09]: The Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

540
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,727
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm good, thank you.

541
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:03,668
[SPEAKER_11]: You're good, you're good.

542
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:05,449
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion.

543
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:14,336
[SPEAKER_09]: As amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scott Peli, further amended by Councilor Scott Peli, and seconded by Councilor Falco.

544
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:18,019
[SPEAKER_09]: May the clerk please call the roll.

545
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,100
[SPEAKER_09]: We never had a second.

546
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

547
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:31,839
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended.

548
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:34,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Behrs?

549
00:35:35,522 --> 00:35:35,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

550
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:37,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco?

551
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:39,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

552
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:40,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

553
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:41,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

554
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:43,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morrell?

555
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:44,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

556
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:45,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

557
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:45,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

558
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:47,051
[SPEAKER_05]: President Falco?

559
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:47,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

560
00:35:47,752 --> 00:35:48,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Knight?

561
00:35:48,632 --> 00:35:48,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

562
00:35:51,575 --> 00:35:51,995
[SPEAKER_05]: You got me.

563
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:53,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

564
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:54,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

565
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,499
[SPEAKER_05]: President Caravaglia, my apologies.

566
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:57,800
[SPEAKER_05]: First mistake of the new year.

567
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:03,166
[SPEAKER_09]: And many more.

568
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:05,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was actually seven votes, not eight.

569
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:11,490
[SPEAKER_09]: 7 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

570
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:18,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Council paper 20010 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

571
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:25,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved the Memphis City Council requests an update from the city administration on the status of procurement of the cleaning service for the new police station.

572
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

573
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:28,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

574
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:32,465
[SPEAKER_07]: When I put this on, I did hear from Chief of Staff Rodriguez,

575
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:46,311
[SPEAKER_07]: this morning, and he let me know that a company has been secured to do the cleanup of the station, because I have been hearing from offices about how the trash had already been piling up in the station.

576
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thank the chief of staff for resolving this issue.

577
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:53,114
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you'd like to speak on it, I welcome that.

578
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:55,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

579
00:36:56,195 --> 00:37:01,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Knight, President Felk, I mean, President Caviello, President, everybody.

580
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:20,463
[SPEAKER_10]: The question I have is I heard that the city administration moved forward, and I think that, listen, if Chief of Staff Rodriguez, just to let us know what kind of custodial services we do have there.

581
00:37:20,923 --> 00:37:26,608
[SPEAKER_10]: And does that extend to the fire headquarters too, or is it just to fire the new police station?

582
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:31,632
[SPEAKER_10]: And is it a full-time position, or is it someone that's moving

583
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:35,515
[SPEAKER_10]: throughout the city in different departments.

584
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:48,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know that we do have different communities do have floating custodians that go from buildings to buildings that need only limited custodial services.

585
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:49,366
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

586
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes Councilor Max.

587
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,563
[SPEAKER_09]: President Felk, John, you good?

588
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,723
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair recognizes Councilor Felk.

589
00:37:59,783 --> 00:38:01,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't see a microphone, that's why.

590
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:03,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't see if the red light's on or not.

591
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:04,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on now.

592
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:06,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Chief of Staff still on the line with us?

593
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:14,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I see him there.

594
00:38:14,508 --> 00:38:17,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm here.

595
00:38:18,149 --> 00:38:20,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez, thank you.

596
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:24,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just elaborate on who's doing the cleaning, how it's being done?

597
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:25,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

598

646
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:40,581

647
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:40,781

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

651
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:41,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

652
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:41,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

653
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:51,652
[SPEAKER_04]: with the awarding vendor just for the police station, because we did know that we had to kind of skip the line on that one a little bit while we bridge over to the longer term agreement that's in place.

654
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:54,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So procurement's working out the final details.

655
00:38:54,075 --> 00:39:02,044
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a couple of details regarding insurance that we're working through with the awarded vendor, but all the buildings are now currently being cleaned appropriately.

656
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:05,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fire station is being cleaned as well.

657
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:06,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to that.

658
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:09,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's headquarters and engine five, but I can send you a copy of the RFP that breaks it down.

659
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:10,709
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could, that'd be great.

660
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

661
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:28,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And to answer Councillor Scarpelli's question, we did do an analysis a couple of months ago about what it would look like to bring this in house and hire floating custodians or what that would look like in terms of, but it just was not going to be a cost effective measure to do that.

662
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It would probably cost around two or three times as much as privatized.

663
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:37,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I may, is the custodian or the cleaning company, do they come in once a day?

664
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:38,727
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that work?

665
00:39:38,747 --> 00:39:40,449
[SPEAKER_04]: The actual frequency?

666
00:39:40,729 --> 00:39:41,409
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be every day.

667
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,851
[SPEAKER_04]: The frequency is included within the RFP.

668
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:48,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So we detail all that within exactly what to be done, when they should be there, and exactly how they're there to perform under the contract.

669
00:39:49,897 --> 00:39:51,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

670
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:51,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

671
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:56,963
[SPEAKER_02]: If Councilor Knight, if we could, if I can make a motion that we receive a copy of the IRFP.

672
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,215
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Falco for a copy of the RFP, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

673
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:09,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anybody that would like to add to the conversation this evening on this item?

674
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Hearing and seeing none.

675
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:21,610
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Caraviello, amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli, and further seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

676
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:23,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Will the clerk please call the roll?

677
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:29,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Council bears.

678
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:30,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

679
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:31,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

680
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:32,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

681
00:40:32,988 --> 00:40:33,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Council marks.

682
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:34,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

683
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:36,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

684
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:39,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

685
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:42,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

686
00:40:44,552 --> 00:40:44,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

687
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:05,567
[SPEAKER_08]: The chair relinquishes the chair back to the president.

688
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:09,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Knight.

689
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:26,774
[SPEAKER_07]: 21001 offered by Councilor Baez, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration provide an update on the impact of the recently passed federal relief bill on city finances, including the potential new revenue and if any funding will be restricted to specific purposes.

690
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:27,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Baez.

691
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:29,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

692
00:41:31,337 --> 00:41:40,742
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about this actually a little bit in reference to rental assistance funds in our subcommittee meeting earlier this evening, but essentially this relief bill has passed.

693
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:44,924
[SPEAKER_12]: There should be some impact on funding for our city or the state.

694
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:50,968
[SPEAKER_12]: And when the administration has an answer, I know that they were mentioning they were waiting to

695
00:41:51,788 --> 00:41:54,515
[SPEAKER_12]: get some figures back from the state and some estimates.

696
00:41:54,555 --> 00:42:01,452
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you want to go into that more, Chief of Staff Rodriguez, but when you have that information, it would be great to get an update as a council.

697
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:12,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, Mr. President, we did have the brief discussion in the subcommittee this evening regarding especially the rental assistance part.

698
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,082
[SPEAKER_04]: We did get some more details in kind of the bridge between meetings.

699
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:23,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to look a lot like CARES, unless you're a population over 200,000, you're not going to get direct disbursement from the federal government.

700
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:30,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally how this will go is it'll trickle through the state government to be disbursed through DLS to the cities.

701
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,776
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are expecting that for the rental assistance program.

702
00:42:32,976 --> 00:42:33,756
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not immediate,

703
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:40,099
[SPEAKER_04]: directly administered by DHCD, or there's a couple of different ways they can do it.

704
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:46,581
[SPEAKER_04]: We're expecting that for the Board of Health Funds, as well as the school-based funds that are to be expected under the latest COVID relief bill.

705
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:49,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So once we get information from DLS, we'll be able to share.

706
00:42:51,343 --> 00:42:52,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Chief of Staff.

707
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:59,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else have their hand up?

708
00:43:00,026 --> 00:43:02,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, anyone have their hand up?

709
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:03,087
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Mr. President.

710
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:07,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by?

[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

712

[SPEAKER_10]: It's working out for him.

715
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,570

716
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:25,171

729
00:43:47,378 --> 00:43:51,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, you have papers in your hands.

730
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,840
[SPEAKER_07]: How many do you have?

731
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having a problem hearing you Mr. Clerk.

732
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:00,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a paper under suspension, Mr. President.

733
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's your paper, so I think someone else is going to need to move to suspend the rules.

734
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:07,920
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, if you could pass it to Vice President Knight.

735

[SPEAKER_08]: All right, the roll is suspended.

761
00:44:50,142 --> 00:44:51,383
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, do you want me to read the paper in?

762
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:53,065
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really in your pocket.

763
00:44:54,646 --> 00:44:55,487
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the hands of the clerk.

764
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:03,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't find it, but it's here.

765
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:12,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered under suspension by President Caravaglia.

766
00:45:13,832 --> 00:45:19,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Peter Brady.

767
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:22,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Brady was a teacher and hockey coach at Medford High for many years.

768
00:45:22,979 --> 00:45:25,080
[SPEAKER_05]: His presence in our community will be dearly missed.

769
00:45:27,002 --> 00:45:27,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

770
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:32,306
[SPEAKER_07]: For those who don't know, Mr. Peter Brady passed away today.

771
00:45:33,787 --> 00:45:37,248
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the dad of former city council Patricia Doherty.

772
00:45:38,388 --> 00:45:42,170
[SPEAKER_07]: But Mr. Brady was a long time teacher at Bedford High School.

773
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:48,112
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a high school coach for nine years during 1960 to 1969.

774
00:45:48,152 --> 00:45:56,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after that, he left and he was a college football and hockey and lacrosse referee.

775
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:58,015
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I say,

776
00:45:58,765 --> 00:46:02,149
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a vibrant member of our community for many years, and he did pass away.

777
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:07,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And our thoughts and prayers go out to the Brady family and their time.

778
00:46:10,418 --> 00:46:12,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we could have a moment of silence for them.

785
00:46:22,759 --> 00:46:27,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just hearing this now, and I'm very sorry for the loss of Mr. Brady.

786
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:38,983
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a long time member of this community, very active, good family man, father, grandfather, and just an all around good guy, and he'll be sorely missed, Mr. President.

787
00:46:41,724 --> 00:46:43,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Felly.

788
00:46:45,472 --> 00:47:08,911
[SPEAKER_10]: to be redundant, but when you talk about great families and great members of this community, and people that really help build the fiber of who we are here in Medford, and the Brady family being that family, one of those families, it is sad to hear, and we pray for the Brady family, so thank you.

789
00:47:09,472 --> 00:47:10,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

792
00:47:26,395 --> 00:47:29,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I too echo the sentiments of my council colleagues.

[SPEAKER_07]: Committee at the whole report.

822
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:08,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, if you could give us a brief update on that committee report.

823
00:49:08,973 --> 00:49:09,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Mr. President.

824
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:12,996

825
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:15,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

826
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I correct on that one?

827
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:23,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will be scheduled, I think, to- My apologies.

828
00:49:24,432 --> 00:49:31,480
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the committee, the whole, on the complaint filed about the procurement of Attorney Bobrowski.

829
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And the administration, Mr. Rodriguez was there for the administration, I believe.

830
00:49:39,448 --> 00:49:51,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said that there were some minor tweaks to the contract that would cure the defect, and that the administration was working on making those minor tweaks to the contract so the defect would be cured.

831
00:49:51,634 --> 00:49:55,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And he foresaw no further action being necessary on that matter.

832
00:49:56,996 --> 00:49:57,696

833

00:50:01,058 --> 00:50:03,239

[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're turning the corner.

865
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,380

00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I have my water here.

867
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:03,783

869
00:51:10,306 --> 00:51:11,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

870
00:51:12,485 --> 00:51:12,845

875
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:26,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, any public participation?

876
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I see no hands raised on the Zoom call, Mr. President.

877
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:29,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

878
00:51:32,265 --> 00:51:34,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I did receive something from Mr. Brabowski.

879
00:51:34,867 --> 00:51:36,928
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be scheduling another meeting.

880
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's for the 19th.

881
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I will let everybody know the next couple of days so we can finish that up.

882
00:51:43,573 --> 00:51:52,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clark, if you could, those papers that he sent out were quite lengthy, and I don't know if anybody at home has a printer big enough to print all those things out.

883
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:54,380
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could print them all for us.

884
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put them in your packets for this weekend.

885
00:51:56,281 --> 00:52:02,826
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could print those out, along with the other stuff, the warrants from Councilor Knight, they look kind of lengthy.

886
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:12,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was one more, the one on the South Street, the recommendations for South Street.

887
00:52:12,995 --> 00:52:21,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, if you could print those out, our home printers just aren't capable of doing all that printing.

888
00:52:24,653 --> 00:52:26,635
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate that.

889
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:28,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Papers, I mean, records.

890
00:52:29,377 --> 00:52:29,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Records.

891
00:52:29,777 --> 00:52:36,323
[SPEAKER_07]: The records of December 15th were passed to Counselor Knight.

892
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:38,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Knight, how did you find those records?

893
00:52:38,945 --> 00:52:40,026
[SPEAKER_07]: In fair order, Mr. President.

894
00:52:40,046 --> 00:52:41,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Move approval.

895
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:45,290
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Counselor Knight to accept the records of December 15th, second and by?

00:52:47,112 --> 00:52:47,432
