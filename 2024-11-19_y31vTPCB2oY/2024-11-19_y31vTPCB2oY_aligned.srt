I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,930
I just have to read the language anyway.

21
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:02,871
Patrick, I think we froze.

22
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,310
I can read the language.

23
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:38,804

I note that we are having problems with our internet connection, so I just need to speak to Mr. Gordon to see if it's been restored.

29
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,383

00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:56,449
We need to salute the flag.

37
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,369
We did that already.

38
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,190
You missed it.

39
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,251
Oh, I'm sorry.

40
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:01,432

63
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:01,084
Wait, Councilor Behrs, I believe you actually have to vote on this.

64
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:02,545
I'm voting present.

65
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:08,294
That was a ceremonial purpose.

66
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:11,097
That was Committee of the Whole.

67
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:12,518
That was ceremonial purposes.

68
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:13,739

69
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,840
You have to vote for one or the other.

70
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:16,802
What are my options?

71
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,184
Yes or no?

72
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:24,009
For Councilor Caraballo, the answer is no or no.

73
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:24,249

74
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,551

77
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:37,715

With a vote of four in favor, two opposed, and one voting present, Councilor Carabiello is elected President of the Medford City Council for 2021.

84
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:31,164
I have spoken with City Solicitor Scanlon, who advised me that because President-Elect Caraviello is attending the meeting remotely, I am allowed to swear him in remotely.

85
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:33,425
He will have to sign the oath form at a later date.

86
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:35,827
So I'm going to administer the oath now.

87
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:39,849
President-Elect Caraviello, if you could stand and raise your right hand, please.

174
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,536
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

175
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:10,881

Yes.

177
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:13,142

Vice President Night.

180
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:15,563
Yes.

181
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:16,604
Councilor Marks.

182
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:16,684
Yes.

183
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:18,473
Councilor Morrell?

184
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:18,933
Yes.

185
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:20,235
Councilor Scarpelli?

186
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:20,675
Yes.

187
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:21,636
President Kerrio?

188
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:22,457
Yes.

189
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:24,240
Senate affirmative motion passes.

190
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,984
2-1-0-0-4 offered by Vice President Knight.

191
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:34,612
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council transfer all papers and committees around the table from 2020 council to the 2020 council.

192
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:36,994
21 council.

193
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:37,635
Councilor Knight.

194
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:45,782
Mr. President, yes, once again, another procedural item that's been done in the past and will hopefully continue in the future to keep all our standing rules and our existing papers alive.

195
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:49,405
So I'd ask my council colleagues to vote in favor of this and I move for approval.

196
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:52,328
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

197
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:53,288
Second.

198
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:54,289
Councilor Falco.

199
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:57,932
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

200
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:00,595
Councilor Bares.

201
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:01,536
Yes.

202
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:02,937
Councilor Falco.

203
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,362
Vice President Knight.

204
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:05,102
Yes.

205
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:06,303
Councilor Marks.

206
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:07,823
Yes.

207
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:08,943
Councilor Morrell.

208
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:09,423
Yes.

209
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:10,484
Councilor Scarpelli.

210
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:11,044
Yes.

211
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:12,344
President Caravaglia.

212
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:13,104
Yes.

213
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:17,065
Senate affirmative motion passes.

214
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:20,246
20659 City of Memphis notice of a public hearing.

215
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:28,788
Public hearing will be held by the Memphis City Council via Zoom on Tuesday evening, January 5th, 2020 at seven o'clock PM.

216
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:31,169
A link to be posted no later than December 31st

217
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:51,839
2020 on a petition from Stevens Automotive Transfer, Inc., doing business as Stevens Towing, 60 Union Street, Medford, Mass., 02155, where a Class II motor vehicle sales facility has an accessory use in accordance with Chapter 94 Zoning Ordinance of the City of Medford, Section 94-148D, Table of Use Regulations, Automobile Uses,

218
00:12:56,637 --> 00:13:09,325
as an accessory use, section 60B, for permission to operate its class two motor vehicle sales facility as an accessory use at 60 Union Street, Method Mass, in industrial zoning district.

219
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:17,130
This should may be seen in the office of the city clerk of Method City Hall, 85 George B. Hassett Drive, room 103, Method Mass, 02155, call 781-393-2400.

220
00:13:21,737 --> 00:13:25,979
2501 for any combinations of A's.

221
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:35,364
By order of the Memphis City Council, Adam Purdyby, City Clerk, advertising the Memphis transcript on December 10th, 2020, December 17th.

222
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:46,110
With this as a public hearing, I open up to who is in favor of this petition.

223
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:49,932
I believe Attorney Abruzzese is on the call.

224
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:50,672
I'm just going to find him.

225
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:55,344
I'm going to unmute him.

226
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,208
Judy Abruzzi, are you in favor of this petition?

227
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:10,951
Yes, I'm here on behalf of the petitioner and I'll make a presentation.

228
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:15,693
I am in favor.

229
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,313
We'll come back to you after.

230
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:17,894
Okay.

231
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:18,274
Thank you.

232
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,495
Anyone else in favor?

233
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,152
Hearing and seeing none, we close this section of the public hearing.

234
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:29,455
Is there anyone opposed to this motion?

235
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,879
I don't see anybody.

236
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:39,661
Hearing and seeing none, we close this portion of the meeting.

237
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,002
Attorney Brzee.

238
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:50,527
Thank you, Mr. President.

239
00:14:50,847 --> 00:15:01,476
Members of the Council, happy to be here this evening via Zoom on behalf of Stevens Automotive Transport, doing business as Stevens Towing.

240
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:07,000
Derek Stevens, the owner and principal, is on the call as well tonight.

241
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:09,722
And a little bit of background.

242
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:19,010
We're seeking a class two motor vehicle sales license for the sole purpose of being able to

243
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:25,796
more efficiently and economically dispose of vehicles that have been abandoned.

244
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:34,443
You may remember, it was before the council, approximately a year, year and a half ago, on behalf of the export towing, a similar situation.

245
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:47,032
So when a vehicle is towed by the towing facility back to the yard and accumulates storage charges under the provisions of Mass General Laws, Chapter 255, Section 39A,

246
00:15:49,465 --> 00:16:07,490
after a certain period of time, the towing company is entitled to post and advertise that vehicle for auction for the purpose of recouping the accumulated towing and storage charges.

247
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,812
And in some situations, there's actually a requirement

248
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:20,813
a third party buyer, and let's assume that the vehicles accumulated storage charges of $3,500, $4,000.

249
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:24,616
We may be able to, and we may in this typical situation, maybe we get a buyer at $3,000.

250
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:30,519
Well, in order for us to transfer a title, we first have to get a,

251
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:42,156
a title from the registry.

252
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:47,782
And if we're not, if we don't hold a dealer's license, we have to pay a sales tax to do that.

253
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:54,590
So this is strictly a paper transaction within the facility.

254
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:59,155
And there's no, this is not a typical secondhand transaction.

255
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,249
automobile facility.

256
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,974
So there'll be no, as you've seen now, you've had the experience of export.

257
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:11,297
You don't see any vehicles being advertised for sale.

258
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:12,639
There's no used car lot.

259
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:19,345
This is also all within, as I say, strictly a inter-office transaction.

260
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:22,067
Thank you, Attorney Dabrowski.

261
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:25,690
Anyone from the council want to speak to this?

262
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,251
Mr. President?

263
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:28,882
Councilor Layton.

264
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,002
Mr. President, thank you very much.

265
00:17:30,443 --> 00:17:31,963
I, for one, don't have a problem with this.

266
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:38,644
As Attorney Abruzzese has noted in the past, this is something that we've done as a past practice with export towing.

267
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,265
We don't see export towing looking like a used car lot.

268
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:49,646
As Attorney Abruzzese has stated, this is nothing more than merely a certification so a paper transaction can take place.

269
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:56,208
That coupled with the fact that Stevens Towing has been in business now for as long as I can remember here in the city of Medford.

270
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:57,488
And they've been a great neighbor.

271
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,271
They've been a great contributor to our community, and they're a valuable asset.

272
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,152
They provide jobs, they pay a living wage here in the city of Medford.

273
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:08,935
And if we can help a business during these times, I think we should do it, Mr. President.

274
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:11,836
So I'm wholeheartedly in favor of this paper, and I move for approval.

275
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:15,478
On the motion of Vice President Knight.

276
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,060
Second, Mr. President.

277
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,361
Second by Councilor Scarpelli.

278
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:20,341
Any further discussion?

279
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,262
Mr. President.

280
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:23,165
Councilor Max.

281
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:24,886
Thank you, Mr. President.

282
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:35,092
I just want to concur with my colleague, Vice President Knight, that Stevens Towing has been a long recognized good business in this community.

283
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:41,095
They're always willing to step forward in the time of need when the city calls upon them.

284
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:46,658
And this seems to me just a way of streamlining their business.

285
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:50,660
And I also have no problem with this, so I would move approval as well.

286
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:52,916
Councilor Baez.

287
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:55,158
Thank you, Mr. President.

288
00:18:55,238 --> 00:19:03,463
I think Attorney Abruzzese already answered this pretty succinctly, but I just want to confirm, there wouldn't be anybody coming to browse or looking at any inventory or anything like that, right?

289
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:05,124
Absolutely not.

290
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:05,924
Great.

291
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:06,945
Thank you.

292
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:08,826
Do we have any further questions?

293
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,370
Hearing and seeing none, I'll move the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

294
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:15,950
Second.

295
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:17,872
By Councilor Scott Kelly.

296
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,853
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

297
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:23,048
Councilor Behrs.

298
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:24,389
Yes.

299
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,450
Councilor Falco.

300
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,311
Yes.

301
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,071
Vice President Knight.

302
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:27,932
Yes.

303
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:28,772
Councilor Marks.

304
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:29,613
Yes.

305
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:30,634
Councilor Morrell.

306
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:31,094
Yes.

307
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:32,014
Councilor Skargel.

308
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:32,475
Yes.

309
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:33,355
President Keohokalole.

310
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:35,357
Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

311
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:36,517
Motion passes.

312
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:38,018
Congratulations, Derek Stephens.

313
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:38,479
Good luck.

314
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,560
Good to see you again.

315
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,161
Thank you.

316
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:41,481
Thank you.

317
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,102
Thank you, Attorney Dabrowski.

318
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:54,053
2-1-0-0-5, authorized by Vice President Knight, whereas the majority of the finalized construction of the GLX Ball Square Station lies within the City of Medford.

319
00:19:54,714 --> 00:20:02,802
Be it resolved that the City of Medford City Council requested that the MBTA consider renaming the GLX Ball Square Station to the Ball Square

320
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:04,444
South Medford Station.

321
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:05,325
Vice President Knight.

322
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,027
Yes, Mr. President.

323
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:15,156
This is something that came up through some discussions with residents in the community based upon the fact that the majority of the station is going to be located in the City of Medford.

324
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:23,185
The majority of the pedestrian paths and access roads are going to be located in the City of Medford, but yet the City of Medford is not getting any recognition or credit.

325
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:30,149
with delivering the Green Line to the city of Medford, or extending the Green Line and the Green Line Extension Project, I should say, Mr. President.

326
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:39,236
So with that being said, I thought this might be something that we could do to boost some community pride and also bring some recognition to the South Medford neighborhood that's been neglected for a number of years.

327
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:42,258
Thank you, Vice President Knight.

328
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:45,160
Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

329
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:51,585
Mr. President?

330
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,656
Mr. Rodriguez, you had your hand up.

331
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:58,997
Thank you, Mr. President.

332
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:00,478
Thank you, Councilor Knight for bringing it forward.

333
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:05,440
This is something that the administration has been in active discussions with MassDOT and Secretary Pollack's office on.

334
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,002
So we are making slow but steady progress and we can update the council as we get more information.

335
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:12,803
Thank you, Mr. Chief of Staff.

336
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:14,964
Mr. President.

337
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:16,705
Councilor Morrell.

338
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:17,605
Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:24,003
I want to thank Vice President Knight for bringing this forward because I think, in addition to this being recognition, this is really just wayfinding.

340
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:28,046
And I think it's something that the city of Medford and specifically South Medford deserves.

341
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,588
So I thank him for raising this and look forward to this moving forward.

342
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,930
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

343
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:35,611
Anyone else?

344
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:36,792
Any other hands up?

345
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:38,874
Motion to approve.

346
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:41,696
Second.

347
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:46,279
The motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

348
00:21:47,813 --> 00:21:48,894
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

349
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,599
Councilor Behrs?

350
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,600
Yes.

351
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,921
Councilor Falco?

352
00:21:58,141 --> 00:21:58,561
Yes.

353
00:21:58,581 --> 00:21:59,262
Vice President Knight?

354
00:21:59,562 --> 00:21:59,822
Yes.

355
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:00,983
Councilor Marks?

356
00:22:02,244 --> 00:22:02,624
Yes.

357
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:03,865
Councilor Morrell?

358
00:22:04,185 --> 00:22:04,386
Yes.

359
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:05,767
Councilor Stark-Teller?

360
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:05,887
Yes.

361
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,494
Yes, affirmative motion passes.

362
00:22:09,514 --> 00:22:23,783
2-1-0-0-6 offered by Vice President Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council requests that the city administration extend a Christmas tree pickup for one additional week.

363
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:25,163
Vice President Knight.

364
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:31,626
Mr. President, well, many of us were glad to see 2020 pass us by in the rear view mirror.

365
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:38,468
There are still many of us, I'm not talking about my wife, I swear to God, that wants to keep the Christmas tree up a little longer than January 11th.

366
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:48,032
So I'm hoping that we can petition the administration to extend Christmas tree pickup for one additional week so that the week of the 11th and the week of the 18th, Christmas tree pickup can be conducted.

367
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:49,732
Thank you.

368
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:51,753
On the motion by Councilor Knight,

369
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,601
Second by Councilor Falco.

370
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:56,421
Any discussion?

371
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,582
Hearing and seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

372
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:04,163
Councilor Behrs?

373
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:05,263
Yes.

374
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:06,403
Councilor Falco?

375
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:06,683
Yes.

376
00:23:07,044 --> 00:23:07,764
Vice President Knight?

377
00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:08,164
Yes.

378
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:09,184
Councilor Marks?

379
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:09,804
Yes.

380
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:10,664
Councilor Morrell?

381
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:10,744
Yes.

382
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:12,285
Councilor Scarpell?

383
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:12,405
Yes.

384
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:16,105
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, motion passes.

385
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:33,438
2-1-007, offered by Vice President Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence in memory of Governor's Counselor Michael J. Callahan, a dedicated public servant who passed on January 6, 2011, following five decades of public service to the people of Memphis.

386
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:39,683
and be it further resolved that the January 5th, 2020 Method City Council meeting be dedicated in his memory.

387
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:40,564
Vice President Knight.

388
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:42,386
Mr. President, thank you very much.

389
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:47,570
For those of you who don't know Michael Callahan, Michael Callahan was a resident of Medford lifelong.

390
00:23:47,891 --> 00:23:50,053
Born and raised in the Fulton Heights on Saunders Street.

391
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:54,116
He was someone who worked in government tirelessly for his whole career.

392
00:23:55,217 --> 00:24:02,785
Senator Bullock, Senator McKenna as the Special Assistant to the Commissioner of Racing, the Chief Steward of the National Association of Government Employees.

393
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:12,395
In 1978, he became the founding member of the Medford Consumer Commission, a commission that still exists in this community today that we fund through a line item in our budget every year.

394
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:15,540
Michael Callahan was elected to the Governor's Council.

395
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,925
He served 12 years as our Governor's Councilor representing the City of Medford.

396
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:27,257
Upon the conclusion of Michael's 12th year, he passed away on the day that his successor was sworn in.

397
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:28,599
Michael never got

398
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:31,514
an opportunity or a chance to enjoy his retirement.

399
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:38,299
But I think what Michael really enjoyed more than anything was the 50 years of public service that he was able to put in to the residents of this community.

400
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,900
He was a Vietnam veteran.

401
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:48,647
He was the author of the Veterans Buyback Bill, which allowed public servants in the police and fire department to buy back military time to put it towards a creditable service.

402
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,489
He was someone that was a forward thinker.

403
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,832
And most importantly, he is the man that saved Wrights Pond from development.

404
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,015
Local legends would say that back in the early 80s,

405
00:24:58,835 --> 00:25:13,781
A developer came in looking to purchase large portions of land around Wrights Pond to build condominium developments and Michael Callahan led the charge to start that development and here we are some years later and we still have Wrights Pond as a beautiful natural asset to the residents here in this community.

406
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:19,624
If you go up to Wrights Pond tomorrow, you'll see the Michael Callahan monument up there that's been kept in great shape.

407
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:21,844
by our staff at the DPW.

408
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:29,366
And annually, I take the time to remember my friend, Michael, a mentor of mine, someone who I sadly miss.

409
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:35,367
So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support me in remembering Michael and the fine work that he did for the people of the city of Medford.

410
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:37,627
Thank you, Vice President Knight.

411
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:39,227
On the motion of Councilor Knight.

412
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:42,808
Second.

413
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:43,168
Seconded by?

414
00:25:43,848 --> 00:25:44,848
Councilor Falco, seconded.

415
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:46,809
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

416
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:47,569
Any discussion?

417
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:50,884
None.

418
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:55,727
Mr. Clerk, on the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

419
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:56,948
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

420
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:58,229
Councilor Behrs?

421
00:25:59,209 --> 00:25:59,449
Yes.

422
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:00,690
Councilor Falco?

423
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,770
Yes.

424
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:02,451
Vice President Knight?

425
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:02,951
Yes.

426
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:03,812
Councilor Marks?

427
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:04,292
Yes.

428
00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:05,073
Councilor Morrell?

429
00:26:05,293 --> 00:26:05,513
Yes.

430
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:06,493
Councilor Scarpelli?

431
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:06,593
Yes.

432
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:08,034
President Caravaglia?

433
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:08,995
Yes.

434
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:09,895
Seven in the affirmative.

435
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:10,636
Motion passes.

436
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:13,998
If I could turn the chair over to Vice President Knight.

437
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:21,227
Paper 21008 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

438
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:31,813
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have MassDOT return to Mystic Avenue in the spring to repaint and re-stripe the areas that are already in place and wearing off.

439
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:33,314
Councilor Caraviello.

440
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,456
Thank you, Mr. President.

441
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,898
This is a project that we just got through doing about a month ago.

442
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:46,862
And if you drive by there, the paint is already wearing off on the crosswalks and some of the siding there.

443
00:26:48,729 --> 00:26:52,791
Come the spring, I'd hate to see it after our DPW guys go out there and do it.

444
00:26:53,611 --> 00:27:02,954
So I would ask that the administration have the DOT come back in the spring and repaint that whole area on Mystic Avenue that they just recently painted.

445
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:06,215
I mean, you paint it in the middle of the winter, the paint's not gonna last too long.

446
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:14,357
Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

447
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:17,540
Do I see Councilor Marks' light on?

448
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,600
Is that a reflection?

449
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:19,341
No.

450
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:19,921
No.

451
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:28,665
On the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

452
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:30,026
Will the clerk please call the roll.

453
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,607
I got to call you last.

454
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:37,290
Councilor Behrs.

455
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:40,571
Yes.

456
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:43,973
Councilor Falco.

457
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:46,312
Councilor Marks.

458
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:46,952
Yes.

459
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:48,853
Yes.

460
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:50,454
Yes.

461
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:50,954
Yes.

462
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:51,074
Yes.

463
00:27:51,094 --> 00:27:51,434
Paper two one.

464
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:04,789
009 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

465
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:14,073
Be it resolved the Medford City Council have the administration report back to the council the status of the 40B developments currently on appeal and the current cost for legal action.

466
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:15,314
Councilor Caraviello.

467
00:28:15,934 --> 00:28:16,755
Thank you, Mr. President.

468
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:20,897
President, we have these 40Bs that are currently on appeal here.

469
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:40,182
And a couple of weeks ago, our own OCP director had stated that we are under the affordable number needed to stop these, and we are also not close to the glam number to stop these.

470
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:46,245
I mean, tonight we talked about affordable housing all year long.

471
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:48,606
We've been talking about affordable housing, affordable housing.

472
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:56,653
Well, unfortunately, right now this is our only avenue to get affordable housing in the city of Medford.

473
00:28:57,293 --> 00:29:01,637
And are we fighting a fight that we can't win here?

474
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:07,388
I mean, I know we had Judy Barrett in the picture for a while there.

475
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:09,188
I don't know if she's still working for the city.

476
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:17,470
I know she was a master at negotiating friendly 40 B's, but I don't know where we are now.

477
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:24,052
I mean, are we just, I hate to see us continue spending money on legal costs on fights that we can't win.

478
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:27,252
I know Mr. Rodriguez is on the call here.

479
00:29:28,272 --> 00:29:30,913
If he'd like to give an opinion on where we stand on this.

480
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,423
Mr. Rodriguez, do you have any comment on behalf of the administration?

481
00:29:39,523 --> 00:29:40,244
Thank you, Mr. President.

482
00:29:40,264 --> 00:29:41,144
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

483
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:48,129
So all three projects that were presented by 40B are currently before the Housing Appeals Committee.

484
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,192
The Board of Appeals asserted Safe Harbor under the GLAM analysis that was performed.

485
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:58,753
last spring that did put us over the required number.

486
00:29:59,153 --> 00:29:59,894
That number was challenged.

487
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:08,077
It's working its way through the process through the HAC now, but we are always open to discussions with those developers as well.

488
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:10,318
So that process is ongoing.

489
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,180
The HAC process is pretty slow.

490
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,263
So I can double check with Alicia and the Board of Appeals to see exactly where we are with the process in an estimated time.

491
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:25,114
have we begun any negotiation with the three groups?

492
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:28,876
I'd be hesitant to discuss that in any detail.

493
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,338
Well, I can say that conversations have taken place.

494
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:32,899
Okay.

495
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:39,942
I mean, again, I say, I know, you know, the numbers aren't working out in our favor.

496
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:47,407
I mean, the numbers that the state came back with and the numbers that the city have, we're not even in the same ballpark with this.

497
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:48,787
So I'd hate to see us,

498
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:54,495
just spin our wheels here and spend money on legal costs that aren't going anywhere.

499
00:30:55,455 --> 00:31:00,097
And we're losing tax dollars on these projects also.

500
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:12,022
I mean, as soon as one of them goes up, we gain a million dollars in tax revenue, not counting the building payment fee on each building.

501
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:15,463
And we help with affordable housing.

502
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:17,284
So I don't know why,

503
00:31:19,132 --> 00:31:22,034
I don't know what the holdup is and why we want to continue to fight these.

504
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:31,959
Because if you follow the trends right now, commercial property around the Boston area is going by the wayside and it's going toward housing.

505
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,622
Because the new business model is not people going back to work in the businesses.

506
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:41,224
So you're going to see a big downturn in commercial.

507
00:31:42,044 --> 00:31:47,507
And I hate to see these people walk out of town and leave us with properties doing nothing.

508
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:52,182
So I'll leave it to my other councilors for any further discussion.

509
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:54,304
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

510
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:57,127
Thank you, Vice President Knight.

511
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:01,530
And thank you, President Caviello, for bringing this resolution forward.

512
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:08,697
We haven't really talked about 40 Bs in a while, and this is a concern, especially if legal fees are mounting.

513
00:32:09,518 --> 00:32:11,400
So I thank you for bringing this forward.

514
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:21,895
If the council or President Caviello, if you wouldn't mind, is it possible to amend the order of resolution to actually have the, I know you asked if I think it was the total legal costs.

515
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:37,804
The current legal cost, if we could have that by actual 40B, how much we've been charged, and actually how much the city has paid to our representatives, which I believe KP Law is representing the city on each of these.

516
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:49,949
So if we could get that broken down by property, by each 40B, how much the city has been billed and how much we've actually paid out in legal fees to KP Law or

517
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:57,135
whatever legal team is representing the city in this matter.

518
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,220
I would be amenable to that Councilor Falco.

519
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,921
Thank you, President Carviello.

520
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:05,464
Do I hear a second?

521
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:05,744
Second.

522
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:07,066
Second by Councilor Scott Pell.

523
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:12,456
If I can, thank you, Mr. President.

524
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:15,380
Thanks for Council President Carvell bringing this forward.

525
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:26,934
But if I could, I recommend that since we haven't talked about it, and that you do hear rumblings on the streets where I've gotten a few residents come to me.

526
00:33:27,895 --> 00:33:39,038
different developers looking at different areas saying, you know what, before it goes to this department or that department, we're just going to just jump everything and just go right to 40B.

527
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:40,278
So I think it's important.

528
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:56,682
I'm going to amend this, and hopefully my fellow counselors can agree that we call for a committee of the whole as soon as possible, that we get all these questions answered with all of our department heads and the city administration together so we can really

529
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,862
start thinking and talking out loud about this.

530
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:04,543
So I know what Councilor Caviello is saying, that this might be a losing battle.

531
00:34:04,703 --> 00:34:10,784
I know what Councilor Falco is saying when we're talking about the funding that's being spent to fight this.

532
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:20,806
And the biggest issue right now is you're seeing developers looking at Medford as, hey, I could come to this area and put up 12 units.

533
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:25,507
And if it doesn't get approved, I'll just jump that and build 24 units and call it a 40B.

534
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:27,628
Because we allow that.

535
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:40,402
And so I think that we need to really have a conversation with everybody at the table as soon as possible so we can get these issues out moving forward in a direction that's really protecting our neighborhood.

536
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:42,364
So thank you, Mr. President.

537
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:49,411
Second.

538
00:34:57,323 --> 00:35:00,025
Have anybody that's, Councilor Marks appears.

539
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,386
The Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

540
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,727
No, I'm good, thank you.

541
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:03,668
You're good, you're good.

542
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:05,449
On the motion.

543
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:14,336
As amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scott Peli, further amended by Councilor Scott Peli, and seconded by Councilor Falco.

544
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:18,019
May the clerk please call the roll.

545
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,100
We never had a second.

546
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,361
Second.

547
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:31,839
As amended.

548
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:34,441
Councilor Behrs?

549
00:35:35,522 --> 00:35:35,843
Yes.

550
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:37,043
Councilor Falco?

551
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:39,345
Yes.

552
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:40,326
Councilor Marks?

553
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:41,167
Yes.

554
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:43,288
Councilor Morrell?

555
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:44,109
Yes.

556
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:45,450
Councilor Scarpelli?

557
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:45,990
Yes.

558
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:47,051
President Falco?

559
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:47,732
Yes.

560
00:35:47,752 --> 00:35:48,392
Vice President Knight?

561
00:35:48,632 --> 00:35:48,873
Yes.

562
00:35:51,575 --> 00:35:51,995
You got me.

563
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:53,156
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:54,537
Yes.

565
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,499
President Caravaglia, my apologies.

566
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:57,800
First mistake of the new year.

567
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:03,166
And many more.

568
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:05,734
So that was actually seven votes, not eight.

569
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:11,490
7 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

570
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:18,815
Council paper 20010 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

571
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:25,620
Be it resolved the Memphis City Council requests an update from the city administration on the status of procurement of the cleaning service for the new police station.

572
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,641
Councilor Caraviello.

573
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:28,582
Thank you, Mr. President.

574
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:32,465
When I put this on, I did hear from Chief of Staff Rodriguez,

575
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:46,311
this morning, and he let me know that a company has been secured to do the cleanup of the station, because I have been hearing from offices about how the trash had already been piling up in the station.

576
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,852
So I thank the chief of staff for resolving this issue.

577
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:53,114
And if you'd like to speak on it, I welcome that.

578
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:55,595
Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

579
00:36:56,195 --> 00:37:01,918
Thank you, President Knight, President Felk, I mean, President Caviello, President, everybody.

580
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:20,463
The question I have is I heard that the city administration moved forward, and I think that, listen, if Chief of Staff Rodriguez, just to let us know what kind of custodial services we do have there.

581
00:37:20,923 --> 00:37:26,608
And does that extend to the fire headquarters too, or is it just to fire the new police station?

582
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:31,632
And is it a full-time position, or is it someone that's moving

583
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:35,515
throughout the city in different departments.

584
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:48,305
Because I know that we do have different communities do have floating custodians that go from buildings to buildings that need only limited custodial services.

585
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:49,366
So thank you.

586
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,208
Chair recognizes Councilor Max.

587
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,563
President Felk, John, you good?

588
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,723
The chair recognizes Councilor Felk.

589
00:37:59,783 --> 00:38:01,164
I can't see a microphone, that's why.

590
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:03,004
I can't see if the red light's on or not.

591
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:04,005
It's on now.

592
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:06,886
Is Chief of Staff still on the line with us?

593
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:14,488
I see him there.

594
00:38:14,508 --> 00:38:17,649
Yeah, I'm here.

595
00:38:18,149 --> 00:38:20,030
Chief of Staff Rodriguez, thank you.

596
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:24,031
Can you just elaborate on who's doing the cleaning, how it's being done?

597
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:25,654
I'm sorry.

598
00:38:25,674 --> 00:38:25,874
I'm sorry.

599
00:38:25,894 --> 00:38:26,154
I'm sorry.

600
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:26,355
I'm sorry.

601
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:26,555
I'm sorry.

602
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:26,775
I'm sorry.

603
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:27,055
I'm sorry.

604
00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:27,255
I'm sorry.

605
00:38:27,355 --> 00:38:27,575
I'm sorry.

606
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:27,955
I'm sorry.

607
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:28,556
I'm sorry.

608
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:28,836
I'm sorry.

609
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:29,056
I'm sorry.

610
00:38:29,096 --> 00:38:29,696
I'm sorry.

611
00:38:29,716 --> 00:38:29,936
I'm sorry.

612
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:30,216
I'm sorry.

613
00:38:30,236 --> 00:38:30,436
I'm sorry.

614
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:31,057
I'm sorry.

615
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:31,377
I'm sorry.

616
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:31,637
I'm sorry.

617
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:31,877
I'm sorry.

618
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:32,097
I'm sorry.

619
00:38:32,117 --> 00:38:32,337
I'm sorry.

620
00:38:32,357 --> 00:38:32,597
I'm sorry.

621
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:32,858
I'm sorry.

622
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:33,078
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:33,318
I'm sorry.

624
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:33,518
I'm sorry.

625
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:34,098
I'm sorry.

626
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:34,438
I'm sorry.

627
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:34,819
I'm sorry.

628
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:35,079
I'm sorry.

629
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:35,359
I'm sorry.

630
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:35,619
I'm sorry.

631
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:35,859
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:36,199
I'm sorry.

633
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,180
I'm sorry.

634
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,460
I'm sorry.

635
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:37,700
I'm sorry.

636
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:37,940
I'm sorry.

637
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,280
I'm sorry.

638
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:38,660
I'm sorry.

639
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:38,900
I'm sorry.

640
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,121
I'm sorry.

641
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:39,361
I'm sorry.

642
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:39,621
I'm sorry.

643
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:39,881
I'm sorry.

644
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:40,161
I'm sorry.

645
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:40,381
I'm sorry.

646
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:40,581
I'm sorry.

647
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:40,781
I'm sorry.

648
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:41,001
I'm sorry.

649
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:41,202
I'm sorry.

650
00:38:41,222 --> 00:38:41,462
I'm sorry.

651
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:41,662
I'm sorry.

652
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:41,862
I'm sorry.

653
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:51,652
with the awarding vendor just for the police station, because we did know that we had to kind of skip the line on that one a little bit while we bridge over to the longer term agreement that's in place.

654
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:54,035
So procurement's working out the final details.

655
00:38:54,075 --> 00:39:02,044
There is a couple of details regarding insurance that we're working through with the awarded vendor, but all the buildings are now currently being cleaned appropriately.

656
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:05,846
So the fire station is being cleaned as well.

657
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:06,367
Next to that.

658
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:09,709
I think it's headquarters and engine five, but I can send you a copy of the RFP that breaks it down.

659
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:10,709
If you could, that'd be great.

660
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,130
I appreciate that.

661
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:28,420
And to answer Councillor Scarpelli's question, we did do an analysis a couple of months ago about what it would look like to bring this in house and hire floating custodians or what that would look like in terms of, but it just was not going to be a cost effective measure to do that.

662
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,742
It would probably cost around two or three times as much as privatized.

663
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:37,987
And if I may, is the custodian or the cleaning company, do they come in once a day?

664
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:38,727
How does that work?

665
00:39:38,747 --> 00:39:40,449
The actual frequency?

666
00:39:40,729 --> 00:39:41,409
It should be every day.

667
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,851
The frequency is included within the RFP.

668
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:48,796
So we detail all that within exactly what to be done, when they should be there, and exactly how they're there to perform under the contract.

669
00:39:49,897 --> 00:39:51,398
Okay.

670
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:51,758
Yes.

671
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:56,963
If Councilor Knight, if we could, if I can make a motion that we receive a copy of the IRFP.

672
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,215
On the motion by Councilor Falco for a copy of the RFP, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

673
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:09,579
Is there anybody that would like to add to the conversation this evening on this item?

674
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,701
Hearing and seeing none.

675
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:21,610
On the motion by Councilor Caraviello, amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli, and further seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

676
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:23,612
Will the clerk please call the roll?

677
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:29,207
Council bears.

678
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:30,468
Yes.

679
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:31,648
Councilor Falco.

680
00:40:31,908 --> 00:40:32,148
Yes.

681
00:40:32,988 --> 00:40:33,589
Council marks.

682
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:34,689
Yes.

683
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:36,930
Yes.

684
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:39,350
Yes.

685
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:42,311
Yes.

686
00:40:44,552 --> 00:40:44,752
Yes.

687
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:05,567
The chair relinquishes the chair back to the president.

688
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:09,208
Thank you, President Knight.

689
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:26,774
21001 offered by Councilor Baez, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration provide an update on the impact of the recently passed federal relief bill on city finances, including the potential new revenue and if any funding will be restricted to specific purposes.

690
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:27,514
Councilor Baez.

691
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:29,496
Thank you, Mr. President.

692
00:41:31,337 --> 00:41:40,742
We talked about this actually a little bit in reference to rental assistance funds in our subcommittee meeting earlier this evening, but essentially this relief bill has passed.

693
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:44,924
There should be some impact on funding for our city or the state.

694
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:50,968
And when the administration has an answer, I know that they were mentioning they were waiting to

695
00:41:51,788 --> 00:41:54,515
get some figures back from the state and some estimates.

696
00:41:54,555 --> 00:42:01,452
I don't know if you want to go into that more, Chief of Staff Rodriguez, but when you have that information, it would be great to get an update as a council.

697
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:12,340
Sure, Mr. President, we did have the brief discussion in the subcommittee this evening regarding especially the rental assistance part.

698
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,082
We did get some more details in kind of the bridge between meetings.

699
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:23,528
So that's going to look a lot like CARES, unless you're a population over 200,000, you're not going to get direct disbursement from the federal government.

700
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:30,194
Generally how this will go is it'll trickle through the state government to be disbursed through DLS to the cities.

701
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,776
So we are expecting that for the rental assistance program.

702
00:42:32,976 --> 00:42:33,756
If it's not immediate,

703
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:40,099
directly administered by DHCD, or there's a couple of different ways they can do it.

704
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:46,581
We're expecting that for the Board of Health Funds, as well as the school-based funds that are to be expected under the latest COVID relief bill.

705
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:49,582
So once we get information from DLS, we'll be able to share.

706
00:42:51,343 --> 00:42:52,343
Thank you, Mr. Chief of Staff.

707
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:59,146
Anyone else have their hand up?

708
00:43:00,026 --> 00:43:02,527
Mr. Clerk, anyone have their hand up?

709
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:03,087
No, Mr. President.

710
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:07,421
Okay, on the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by?

711
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:11,183
Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

712
00:43:12,204 --> 00:43:13,464
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

713
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:18,347
Hey, the Zoom's working out.

714
00:43:19,108 --> 00:43:20,228
It's working out for him.

715
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,570
This is great.

716
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:25,171
Councilor Behrs.

717
00:43:25,891 --> 00:43:26,972
Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

718
00:43:26,992 --> 00:43:28,333
Yes.

719
00:43:28,393 --> 00:43:29,133
Councilor Falco.

720
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:30,034
Yes.

721
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:30,814
Vice President Knight.

722
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:31,775
Yes.

723
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:32,975

Yes.

725
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:36,456
Yes.

726
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:42,337
Yes.

727
00:43:42,357 --> 00:43:44,398
Yes.

728
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:47,278
70 affirmative motion passes.

729
00:43:47,378 --> 00:43:51,359
Mr. Clerk, you have papers in your hands.

730
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,840
How many do you have?

731
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,021
I'm having a problem hearing you Mr. Clerk.

732
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:00,898
I have a paper under suspension, Mr. President.

733
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,999
I believe it's your paper, so I think someone else is going to need to move to suspend the rules.

734
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:07,920
OK, if you could pass it to Vice President Knight.

735
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,821
Motion to suspend the rules.

736
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:11,881
Motion to suspend the rules.

737
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:12,782
Second.

738
00:44:13,162 --> 00:44:14,362
To take papers in the hands of the clerk.

739
00:44:15,423 --> 00:44:17,043
Second by Councilor Beaz.

740
00:44:17,683 --> 00:44:18,924
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

741
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:20,865
Hang on.

742
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:22,685
OK.

743
00:44:26,406 --> 00:44:27,527
Mr. President.

744
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:30,604
All right, let's see if we can get this one right.

745
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:31,985
Councilor Beres?

746
00:44:33,206 --> 00:44:33,427
Yes.

747
00:44:35,348 --> 00:44:36,049
Councilor Falco?

748
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:36,449
Yes.

749
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:37,731
Councilor Marks?

750
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:38,331
Yes.

751
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:39,352
Councilor Morrell?

752
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:39,813
Yes.

753
00:44:40,673 --> 00:44:41,474
Councilor Scarpelli?

754
00:44:41,714 --> 00:44:42,035

755
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,156
President Caravaglio?

756
00:44:43,876 --> 00:44:44,116
Yes.

757
00:44:44,357 --> 00:44:45,217
Vice President Nye?

758
00:44:45,237 --> 00:44:45,498
Yes.

759
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:46,899
Finally.

760
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:49,922
All right, the roll is suspended.

761
00:44:50,142 --> 00:44:51,383
All right, do you want me to read the paper in?

762
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:53,065
It's really in your pocket.

763
00:44:54,646 --> 00:44:55,487
It's in the hands of the clerk.

764
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:03,365
I can't find it, but it's here.

765
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:12,511
Offered under suspension by President Caravaglia.

766
00:45:13,832 --> 00:45:19,036
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Peter Brady.

767
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:22,459
Mr. Brady was a teacher and hockey coach at Medford High for many years.

768
00:45:22,979 --> 00:45:25,080
His presence in our community will be dearly missed.

769
00:45:27,002 --> 00:45:27,782
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

770
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:32,306
For those who don't know, Mr. Peter Brady passed away today.

771
00:45:33,787 --> 00:45:37,248
He was the dad of former city council Patricia Doherty.

772
00:45:38,388 --> 00:45:42,170
But Mr. Brady was a long time teacher at Bedford High School.

773
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:48,112
He was a high school coach for nine years during 1960 to 1969.

774
00:45:48,152 --> 00:45:56,874
And then after that, he left and he was a college football and hockey and lacrosse referee.

775
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:58,015
And like I say,

776
00:45:58,765 --> 00:46:02,149
He was a vibrant member of our community for many years, and he did pass away.

777
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:07,955
And our thoughts and prayers go out to the Brady family and their time.

778
00:46:10,418 --> 00:46:12,260
And if we could have a moment of silence for them.

779
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,901
The motion of Councilor Caviello.

780
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:14,102
Second.

781
00:46:15,123 --> 00:46:16,604
Second by Councilor Falco.

782
00:46:16,644 --> 00:46:17,185
Councilor Maxwell.

783
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:19,097
Thank you, Mr. President.

784
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:22,178
I'm kind of taken back.

785
00:46:22,759 --> 00:46:27,480
I'm just hearing this now, and I'm very sorry for the loss of Mr. Brady.

786
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:38,983
He was a long time member of this community, very active, good family man, father, grandfather, and just an all around good guy, and he'll be sorely missed, Mr. President.

787
00:46:41,724 --> 00:46:43,025
Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Felly.

788
00:46:45,472 --> 00:47:08,911
to be redundant, but when you talk about great families and great members of this community, and people that really help build the fiber of who we are here in Medford, and the Brady family being that family, one of those families, it is sad to hear, and we pray for the Brady family, so thank you.

789
00:47:09,472 --> 00:47:10,593
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

790
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:16,810
very involved.

791
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:25,114
I remember meeting him when I was in high school, actually going to Medford High School years ago, and a very nice man and thoughts and prayers to his family.

792
00:47:26,395 --> 00:47:29,036
I too echo the sentiments of my council colleagues.

793
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:34,098
On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, I mean Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

794
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:35,099
Will the clerk please call the roll.

795
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:39,541
Councilor Bares.

796
00:47:40,782 --> 00:47:41,002
Yes.

797
00:47:42,942 --> 00:47:43,142
Yes.

798
00:47:43,162 --> 00:47:43,222
Yes.

799
00:47:44,123 --> 00:47:44,283
Yes.

800
00:47:44,303 --> 00:47:44,383
Yes.

801
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,144
Please rise for a moment of silence.

802
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:23,389
Motion to revert back to regular business.

803
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:32,411
On the motion to revert back to the regular order of business by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, will the clerk please call the roll.

804
00:48:37,692 --> 00:48:38,252
Councilor Behrs.

805
00:48:39,573 --> 00:48:39,773
Yes.

806
00:48:41,273 --> 00:48:41,933
Councilor Falco.

807
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:43,033
Yes.

808
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:43,634
Councilor Marks.

809
00:48:43,974 --> 00:48:44,314
Yes.

810
00:48:44,514 --> 00:48:45,114
Councilor Morrell.

811
00:48:45,494 --> 00:48:45,694
Yes.

812
00:48:46,014 --> 00:48:46,754
Councilor Scarpelli.

813
00:48:46,954 --> 00:48:47,214
Yes.

814
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:48,174
President Caviello.

815
00:48:48,855 --> 00:48:49,055
Yes.

816
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:49,975
Vice President Knight.

817
00:48:50,075 --> 00:48:50,275
Yes.

818
00:48:52,403 --> 00:48:53,964
Relinquish the chair to the president.

819
00:48:55,285 --> 00:48:56,345
Reports of committees.

820
00:48:57,586 --> 00:49:00,788
20688 December 22nd, 2020.

821
00:49:00,868 --> 00:49:02,089
Committee at the whole report.

822
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:08,753
Mr. Clerk, if you could give us a brief update on that committee report.

823
00:49:08,973 --> 00:49:09,614
Yes, Mr. President.

824
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:12,996
That was the, I believe that was the meeting with zoning consultant Bobrowski.

825
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:15,417
Okay.

826
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,438
Am I correct on that one?

827
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:23,771
And we will be scheduled, I think, to- My apologies.

828
00:49:24,432 --> 00:49:31,480
That was the committee, the whole, on the complaint filed about the procurement of Attorney Bobrowski.

829
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,827
And the administration, Mr. Rodriguez was there for the administration, I believe.

830
00:49:39,448 --> 00:49:51,594
And he said that there were some minor tweaks to the contract that would cure the defect, and that the administration was working on making those minor tweaks to the contract so the defect would be cured.

831
00:49:51,634 --> 00:49:55,776
And he foresaw no further action being necessary on that matter.

832
00:49:56,996 --> 00:49:57,696
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

833
00:49:57,736 --> 00:50:00,838
I believe the council did request some information on that, right?

834
00:50:01,058 --> 00:50:03,239
I believe the council did request some information on it, though.

835
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:09,061
Hey, do we have a motion to move approval, Mr. President?

836
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:10,922
I move.

837
00:50:11,263 --> 00:50:13,885
On a motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

838
00:50:14,305 --> 00:50:15,506
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:20,349

Councilor Scarpelli?

850
00:50:28,115 --> 00:50:28,395
Yes.

851
00:50:28,435 --> 00:50:29,256
President Caravaggio?

852
00:50:29,796 --> 00:50:30,036
Yes.

853
00:50:30,216 --> 00:50:31,597

854
00:50:31,617 --> 00:50:32,158
Mr. President.

855
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:34,754
Yes, who's that?

856
00:50:35,476 --> 00:50:36,317
Council Scott Pelly.

857
00:50:36,778 --> 00:50:37,940
Council Scott Pelly.

858
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:38,781
Before we adjourn.

859
00:50:43,771 --> 00:50:48,454
I just want to recognize a sense of normalcy we haven't seen here since March.

860
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:51,996
I want to welcome City Messenger back.

861
00:50:52,076 --> 00:50:52,476
Thank you.

862
00:50:52,956 --> 00:50:54,817
Welcome back, Larry.

863
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:55,718
So thank you.

864
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:58,620
I think we're turning the corner.

865
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,380
This is a sign.

866
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,201
I have my water here.

867
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:03,783
I finally have the correct placket in front of me.

868
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:10,266
I know it was Council Penta for a little while, so I appreciate Larry being back.

869
00:51:10,306 --> 00:51:11,007
Thank you so much.

870
00:51:12,485 --> 00:51:12,845
Thank you.

871
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:14,547
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

872
00:51:14,707 --> 00:51:15,749
Welcome back, Larry.

873
00:51:15,769 --> 00:51:18,391
Good to have you back, Larry.

874
00:51:20,313 --> 00:51:22,276
Do we have any public participation?

875
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:26,520
Mr. Clerk, any public participation?

876
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,622
I see no hands raised on the Zoom call, Mr. President.

877
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:29,383
Okay.

878
00:51:32,265 --> 00:51:34,707
I did receive something from Mr. Brabowski.

879
00:51:34,867 --> 00:51:36,928
We will be scheduling another meeting.

880
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,990
I think it's for the 19th.

881
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,232
I will let everybody know the next couple of days so we can finish that up.

882
00:51:43,573 --> 00:51:52,899
Mr. Clark, if you could, those papers that he sent out were quite lengthy, and I don't know if anybody at home has a printer big enough to print all those things out.

883
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:54,380
If you could print them all for us.

884
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,541
I'll put them in your packets for this weekend.

885
00:51:56,281 --> 00:52:02,826
If you could print those out, along with the other stuff, the warrants from Councilor Knight, they look kind of lengthy.

886
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:12,975
And there was one more, the one on the South Street, the recommendations for South Street.

887
00:52:12,995 --> 00:52:21,682
Like I said, if you could print those out, our home printers just aren't capable of doing all that printing.

888
00:52:24,653 --> 00:52:26,635
So I appreciate that.

889
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:28,917
Papers, I mean, records.

890
00:52:29,377 --> 00:52:29,757
Records.

891
00:52:29,777 --> 00:52:36,323
The records of December 15th were passed to Counselor Knight.

892
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:38,765
Counselor Knight, how did you find those records?

893
00:52:38,945 --> 00:52:40,026
In fair order, Mr. President.

894
00:52:40,046 --> 00:52:41,547
Move approval.

895
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:45,290
On the motion by Counselor Knight to accept the records of December 15th, second and by?

896
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:46,751
Second.

897
00:52:47,112 --> 00:52:47,432

908

909
00:53:02,428 --> 00:53:02,628

Yes.

912
00:53:06,169 --> 00:53:08,950
Sorry, Vice President Kerrio, I'm going to say this a couple more times.

913
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,530
Vice President Kerrio.

914
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:11,510
Yes.

915
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,410
Seven in favor of the motion passes.

916
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:19,412
Records of the December 22nd, 2020 meeting were passed to Councilor Marks.

917
00:53:19,872 --> 00:53:21,572
Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

918
00:53:22,602 --> 00:53:27,347
Mr. President, I did not find them in order, and I'd ask that they be laid on the table for one more week.

919
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:27,727
Second.

920
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:33,012
On a motion by Councilor Marks to table them for one more week, seconded by Councilor Knight.

921
00:53:33,432 --> 00:53:34,593

And again, I thank everyone for my first meeting.

941
00:54:24,936 --> 00:54:25,697
I wish I was there.

942
