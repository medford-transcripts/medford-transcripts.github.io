1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,080
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,961
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,342
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,382
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:20,723
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:28,905
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:32,786
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,287
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:45,810
All right, thanks so much for being with me this evening.

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,411
If you don't mind just starting us off by introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and who you are.

11
00:00:51,812 --> 00:00:56,113
My name is Tarek Samman, and I use he, him, and I'm running for Congress in District 5.

12
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:56,473
Great.

13
00:00:58,254 --> 00:00:58,654
Thanks, Tarek.

14
00:00:58,694 --> 00:00:59,314
Great to meet you.

15
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,155
So we're going to talk- Thank you for having me.

16
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:01,955
Yeah, of course.

17
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:04,335
We're going to talk a lot more about your run for Congress.

18
00:01:05,276 --> 00:01:11,198
But before we do that, I'm going to ask you the question that I ask everyone on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

19
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:12,338
And what do you like to eat there?

20
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:17,806
Well, first of all, for full disclosure, I don't live in Medford, I live in Cambridge.

21
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:23,991
So I will go with my favorite restaurant in Cambridge, if you don't mind.

22
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:31,176
There is this restaurant, it's a Chinese restaurant called Zoe, it's on the border between Cambridge and Somerville.

23
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:34,956
And I like going there.

24
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:38,919
I like their noodle, their chow mein, and I've been ordering from there nonstop.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,201
Oh, cool.

26
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:46,525
I'm not sponsored by them, but they didn't pay me to say this.

27
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:50,608
No money exchange chances for this project.

28
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:51,168
Cool.

29
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,469
Thanks for sharing that.

30
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,674
Can you tell us a little bit about, so it sounds like your district would cover part of Cambridge, part of Somerville, part of Medford.

31
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:03,819
All thanks to gerrymandering.

32
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:17,070
I mean, the way that they drew the district is quite frustrating, because with gerrymandering, what happened is that the people in office decide their own constituents, rather than the constituent deciding their own representative.

33
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,713
And the way that is structured, there is around 23 to 24 cities.

34
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:25,480
Par of Cambridge is with IANA.

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:35,820
If you know Central Square, from Central Square toward MIT in the South is with IANA, and then from Central Square toward the North and Somerville border is with Katherine Clark.

36
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:45,005
And Somerville is not part of the district, even though two of the cities on the border of Somerville, Revere and Malden and Cambridge, are part of District 5.

37
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:46,986
It's all gerrymandered.

38
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:51,450
And even Lowell was part of the district, and then they also removed it.

39
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,553
I think the last time they did gerrymander, I think 2021-2022, as I remember.

40
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:57,875
But yeah, that's the district.

41
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:59,576
It's quite an interesting district.

42
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:00,317
It's quite big.

43
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:10,146
Certain cities fall within the working class, lower income, and a certain part of it is with the middle to upper class.

44
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:14,228
The way they even divided it doesn't make sense, but it is what it is.

45
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:19,157
That's why we're running for offices and this gerrymandering thing.

46
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:19,998
Okay, great.

47
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:21,479
So, yeah, so thank you for sharing that.

48
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:24,161
So, but there is a section of Medford that is included in.

49
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:29,245
Yes, Medford is in my district and it's 1 of my favorite cities.

50
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:32,167
I'll tell you that you're mine too.

51
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:37,531
And so right now, Catherine Clark is in this, this position that you'd be running for in the fall.

52
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,499
Yeah, perfect.

53
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:46,026
So can you tell us, you know, it sounds like gerrymandering is part of it, but what kind of helped you arrive to this decision to run for office?

54
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:53,915
I think when people ask me why I decided to run, I usually have two answers, one short answer and one long answer.

55
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:57,057
The short answer is because I want to serve.

56
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,560
I want to serve the people.

57
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:14,913
I want to serve those who are politically homeless, those who their voices are not being heard, those who their pain are not being recognized, and those who are starting to believe in a hopeless reality that pushing them away from participating in politics or believing in the governmental institution.

58
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,655
I want to serve these people.

59
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:20,119
And my long answer is, I am one of these people.

60
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,321
I am politically homeless.

61
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:25,746
My voice has not been heard by my representative.

62
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:27,708
My pain has not been recognized.

63
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:29,190
And I'm starting to feel hopeless.

64
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:35,438
But at the same time, I believe that when we are faced with circumstances like this,

65
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:41,219
It's the duty of the youth of my generation to step up, fight back and pay the sacrifice.

66
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,781
And by paying the sacrifice, I don't mean to resort to violence, or just be cynical.

67
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:51,902
I mean to participate in politics like you've never participated before.

68
00:04:52,743 --> 00:05:00,625
Aim high, run for office, engage and be very aggressive, go and knock on doors, phone bank, do everything to

69
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:12,791
restore the country that you believe in, which unfortunately for my generation, those who were born in the 1990s and early 2000s, they grew up in an America that's completely different than those before.

70
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:22,276
We went through the Iraq war, we went through the Afghanistan war, we went through the economic crisis in 2008, and we went through the disappointment with the Obama presidency and then Trump presidency.

71
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:25,058
So I don't think my generation have seen anything

72
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:27,543
extremely positive of this country.

73
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:33,947
But at the same time, I believe that we can change that by taking responsibility and stepping up.

74
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,969
And that's why I'm running.

75
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:37,849
Okay.

76
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:38,289
Yeah.

77
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:43,652
And so it sounds like there's a lot of critiques that you have of kind of how our government is being run right now.

78
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:51,037
And I guess if you could like kind of share some of your top priorities, if you were elected, what you'd want to kind of start in terms of change?

79
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:57,718
I think one important thing is to ask ourselves this question, what got us here, right?

80
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:00,278
Why did Trump win and Kamala lost?

81
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,619
And the quick answer is money in politics.

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:17,603
The super PACs helped Trump get back into presidency, and the same super PACs made Kamala Harris not take a decisive decision on issues that matter to her campaign, and that made a lot of people not vote for her.

83
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:20,744
So the issue of money in politics

84
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:26,424
And corruption in Congress is one of the top priority that our campaign is focusing on.

85
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:35,430
And it should be the top priority for all the other campaigns who run in the wave of Democrat 2.0 and who want to enter office in the midterm election.

86
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:44,596
Because I truly believe without fixing the corruption and the super PAC influence in our Congress, we can't achieve all the beautiful things that we want to achieve.

87
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:48,158
I mean, I would love to promise the world to my people.

88
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:50,440
I would love to promise a future where

89
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:52,618
They know their children are going to be safe.

90
00:06:52,678 --> 00:07:00,542
They know that they're going to have free health care, free education and ability to function in a society without hate.

91
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:11,127
But when I was creating the platform and running my campaign, I told my team, I don't want to feel like I'm lying to my constituents or promising things that I know we can't deliver.

92
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:18,671
Because when you enter Congress, you'll be dealing with 400 other Congress members and you will have to negotiate with them to get the thing that you want.

93
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:29,487
The rules of the game are not fair, because these same 400-plus Congress representatives are influenced by money and politics, and they have favors that they owe.

94
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:37,152
Because of these favors, they can't compromise or vote on child care or vote on health care.

95
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:47,369
bend the need to stay in office, because they're not used for people to participate and engage in politics or donate to them.

96
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:52,552
They're used to being slaves to their own super PAC influencer.

97
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:56,634
So yeah, the first one is we need to fight corruption.

98
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:00,900
campaign corruption, election finance.

99
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,002
I need to be also a true representative.

100
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:05,823
I need to be a listener.

101
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:07,964
It's a big issue in our district.

102
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:11,667
They don't feel that their representative is listening to them.

103
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:15,449
They don't see her as active as they would wish her to be.

104
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:23,134
And the third one, of course, which is an issue that everyone is concerned about, which is affordability.

105
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:30,638
So affordability and the way that our campaign frame it is to make the American dream affordable.

106
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,240
Because, you know, for immigrants, let me give you a data point.

107
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,782
Twenty five percent of people who live in our district are foreign born.

108
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,342
So we have a decent immigrant population, and I'm also a son of an immigrant, and my story is also very similar to a lot of their stories.

109
00:08:47,042 --> 00:09:00,506
And we all came here for the American dream, yet we've been, our expectation was high, and it was faced with the reality that the American dream sometimes only makes sense if you're sleeping, because it's too expensive to afford.

110
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:04,367
So these are our top priority.

111
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,168
But on our campaign website as well,

112
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:18,495
When we started this idea of running the campaign, and I started talking to a lot of people, I talked to professors at Harvard and MIT, I talked to people in my own district.

113
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:25,420
And one thing, there's this professor at Harvard, his name is Marshall Gans.

114
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,783
I think he's quite popular among people who know about campaign.

115
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:31,164
He was the architect behind Obama's campaign.

116
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:36,428
And he also trained Mamdani staff, and he went there and he met with them.

117
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:38,370
And he was one of the first people that I talked to.

118
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:39,775
And he told me this.

119
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:51,667
He said, the reason why the Democrats lost the presidential election, it's because when they went around talking to people, they were telling them how to feel rather than listening to them.

120
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:54,855
And that was a big issue.

121
00:09:55,195 --> 00:10:14,464
So he told me, you better get 100 volunteers, go around, talk to people, and then build a campaign around values, not issues, values that bring all the people together, that people share, that people care about, and urge them to participate in politics to make a change.

122
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:30,477
It's been a long process, but so far I'm proud of the progress we achieved, and I'm hoping to make a change that

123
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,240
I envision, you know, you should have a vision and you should follow that vision and we'll see how it goes.

124
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:52,523
I'm wondering like what you've learned so far by talking to people, like if anything has surprised you or if there's anything that's come out of your... One thing that surprised me is the fact that a lot of them don't know who Kathleen Clark is.

125
00:10:53,163 --> 00:10:55,304
In fact, when I started doing my research and

126
00:10:56,804 --> 00:10:59,086
Another thing I want to talk about is polling.

127
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:05,511
So because our district district 5 is considered a safe seat, a blue district, it's not that interesting to those who are.

128
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,128
conducting polls because it's not a swing state.

129
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:15,695
So when I started doing my research, there was not a lot of polls about approval of Katherine Clark.

130
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:19,179
There is not a lot of polls of people, the issues that they care about.

131
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:26,547
However, there is UMass Amherst University here in Massachusetts, and they conduct a lot of polls, and they usually do it at a state level.

132
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:37,688
I've read their polls and I've talked to people, and usually the first thing people don't recognize who Kathleen Clark is, and sometimes they think that Ayanna Paisley is their own representative.

133
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:46,352
A lot of them, you know, because they're not used to people knocking on their doors for federal election, local election is different.

134
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,916
They were surprised that, you know, I'm running for Congress and I'm talking to them.

135
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:57,701
Like, I remember I went to the street and I started recording some videos and talking to people, interviewing them.

136
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:59,102
And they're like, you're running for Congress?

137
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:00,063
Oh, that's surprising.

138
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:02,065
And like, they got excited.

139
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,426
Like, they would love to see it.

140
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:08,210
So, yeah, the first thing that surprised me is the fact that they don't know who's Kathleen Clark is.

141
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:21,445
Secondly, the fact that it's a very educated district, and you will hear a lot of interesting things that you've never heard about, like ideas and propositions.

142
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,887
I'm like, this is really interesting.

143
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:28,290
If this campaign starts getting some steam and some attention, I'm going to propose all these new ideas.

144
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:37,568
out-of-the-box ideas and ideas that also relate to AI, which is unfortunately an issue that not a lot of Congress members are talking about.

145
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:41,691
So caffeine clogs not being known, the fact that the district is very educated.

146
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:48,757
And the third one is, it's full of young families who are really concerned about the future of this country.

147
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:55,383
And another data point that I want to add is that 65% of the people in our district are independent.

148
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:57,515
and their young families.

149
00:12:57,595 --> 00:13:05,092
So when I went around talking to them, they told me how much it's hard to afford things, how much life had been really difficult, and

150
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:17,872
I remember this story, one of the Uber drivers that I talked about my campaign, he was an Algerian American who came to America in the 1980s or 1970s.

151
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:24,998
And he worked really hard to, you know, set up his own business, get money and build a future for his own children.

152
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:28,561
And I remember he was telling me about his success in business.

153
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:29,742
And I'm like, in the back of my mind,

154
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:31,803
Why are you still Ubering?

155
00:13:31,963 --> 00:13:34,125
Are you doing it as a pleasure to talk to people?

156
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:38,328
And he said, I'm doing it to help my children pay for their own student loans.

157
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:43,212
And I remember hearing this and I got so angry.

158
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:46,314
I'm like, it doesn't make sense.

159
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:51,278
And then another story that I also have,

160
00:13:52,794 --> 00:14:06,266
I was talking to this old guy who, it happened actually today, and he told me how he used to own a business and then because of the economical situations, his business went bankrupt and now he's looking for a job.

161
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:17,015
But because he's old and now with this all new ways of hiring people and using AI to filter resumes and CEO, he told me it's so hard to get into a human.

162
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:21,026
And I don't know how this whole AI hiring thing works.

163
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:21,446
I don't know.

164
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,028
I'm not able to get a job because of it.

165
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:28,391
He just put me in front of people, and I can't convince him to hire me.

166
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,234
If he listens to this broadcast, you know what I'll be talking about.

167
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:34,535
He lives in Revere.

168
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:37,817
So I'm still waiting for your City Council meeting if you want me to come.

169
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:41,100
He told me, he lives in Revere.

170
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,761
He usually attends the City Council meeting.

171
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:45,022
I'm like, I want to show up in one of these meetings.

172
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:57,544
But yeah, all these stories that you hear about, you know, people struggling and the more details you get really, really frustrated and angry.

173
00:14:57,624 --> 00:15:04,190
And here's why I told you I'm running for those who their pain are not being recognized, for those who have stories are not being heard.

174
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,642
And we all have these stories.

175
00:15:07,382 --> 00:15:14,486
And if you're a Republican or a Democrat or independent or wherever you stand on the political spectrum, when you hear these stories, your heart will ache.

176
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:19,868
You will feel the pain because you're probably facing the same struggle.

177
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:20,989
You probably heard these stories.

178
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:22,230
You probably live in these stories.

179
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:31,594
So yeah, stories, stories, stories, and the amount of stories that I heard, it's heartbreaking, just heartbreaking.

180
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:37,238
It's, I mean, and now with the ice, it's, it's add more pain.

181
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:40,780
Yeah, it does like make me wonder.

182
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:52,927
So when, so on this podcast, I like interview other kind of local politicians, like city councilors, school committee members, mayoral candidates, and the sense that I get is that there's

183
00:15:53,697 --> 00:16:00,664
this demand, or this not demand, there's an idea that people have of like, what these positions can actually accomplish.

184
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:02,866
And I think it's kind of vague sometimes.

185
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:10,714
So like, what is in the role in like, as a congressperson, like what are what is like actually within your power to change?

186
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:14,178
Or like, what would be what would the role be able to accomplish?

187
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:24,182
I think as a Congress member, you should view it in two lenses, the lens of how you're going to act locally in your own district and the lens of how you're going to act in Washington, D.C.

188
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:25,542
behind closed doors.

189
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:43,974
So locally, and this is also on our platform, one of the main issues that we're going to be focusing on is I want to connect with all the city council members, all the local politicians, all the constituents, all the independent media, and build a strong coalition that will make us

190
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:59,181
influence our own politics and at the same time solidify our position against all those who are trying to divide us, whether it's through ICE entering our communities or other threats.

191
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:02,803
So that's the first lens.

192
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:06,605
Locally, I should be an organizer and be open and listen to the people.

193
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:09,066
In Washington, D.C., you should be

194
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:18,633
Negotiator, you should understand that these politicians are influenced by, you know, super packs and the language that they're using behind.

195
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:22,080
In a closed door and in public is completely different.

196
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:37,790
And if you watch any of the Congress members' interviews, you'll hear stories of how they talk about their colleague who comes to them after a vote and tells them, this is very brave of you to vote on this, but I can't do it because I'm afraid of losing my seat or my party turning against me.

197
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,230
You've probably heard this if you watch any of their interviews.

198
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:47,472
And if I end up coming to Congress, I want to play the role of

199
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:53,647
making sure that these Congress members put the American people first.

200
00:17:53,887 --> 00:18:00,169
I want to emphasize to them, like, hey, when you do the oath for office, it's for the country.

201
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:01,169
It's for the Constitution.

202
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:01,849
It's for the people.

203
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:03,370
You don't do it for the super PACs.

204
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,212
And I'm not going to be, you know, compromising on my principles and values.

205
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:13,734
I'm not going to, you know, do like vote on certain things and then put an explanation.

206
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,194
Oh, we needed to compromise here and compromise there.

207
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:17,735
I mean, compromising is important, but

208
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:22,311
there is a certain limit when it comes to your values, when it comes to your principles.

209
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:26,895
And unfortunately, we've seen a lot of Congress members compromise.

210
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:43,530
And the issue we are facing right now as well with Congress is that there is this video that I watched a long time ago, and it's a video of Nancy Pelosi's daughter going around interviewing Congress members who lost their position or they're just retiring.

211
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,891
I think she did it in 2018.

212
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:46,052
You can go and watch it on YouTube.

213
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:50,548
And I remember at the end of the video, she asked him this question.

214
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:56,712
First of all, they were very cynical of the Congress and they understand the popularity is sinking.

215
00:18:57,472 --> 00:19:01,074
And at the end of the video, she told him, how do we form the Congress, something along the lines.

216
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:03,276
And they were like, it's up to the American people.

217
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,838
And then you go to the commit of that YouTube video.

218
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:11,481
The people are literally saying on the commit, but we voted for you to fix the Congress.

219
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:12,962
Oh, my God.

220
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:20,755
It's just disconnect with people in the position of power, of not recognizing that it's their duty to fix the rules of the game.

221
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:24,077
It's their duty to represent the American people.

222
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:29,580
You don't just go there and get used to your own position and get used to being in Washington, D.C.

223
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,622
that you lost touch with your own constituent.

224
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:40,227
But at the same time, if you want to talk about your power in Congress, so when you enter Congress, you are usually assigned to committees.

225
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:46,418
And then the committees are divided between the Democrat and the Republican.

226
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:54,122
And in Congress, your basic role is to sponsor bills that the people want you to sponsor.

227
00:19:54,702 --> 00:20:04,307
And then after sponsoring a bill, you go around and negotiate, and you try to make the other Congress member to co-sponsor the same bill, so it brings more visibility and support, so it passes the committee level.

228
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:12,242
But the issue that you face in Congress is that once you sponsor the bill and go to the committee, 90 percent of these bills die at the committee level.

229
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:19,507
And that's because of the whole polarization, the whole control of super PACs, the whole, you know, I'm not willing to compromise.

230
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,308
I'm not willing to, you know.

231
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:24,509
vote in a certain way.

232
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:30,611
But even if the bill, if you were so lucky and your bill passed the committee level, then you have the floor.

233
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:36,313
And usually the party in the position of leadership is the one who controls which bill goes to the floor for the vote.

234
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:40,914
So you have all of this polarization, all of this division in Congress.

235
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,396
And because of this, it's almost impossible to achieve anything.

236
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:50,228
That's why I told you from the beginning, we need to address the rules of the game.

237
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:51,708
We need to fix the rules of the game.

238
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:55,550
Otherwise, we can't achieve much.

239
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:02,751
Are there other like-minded people that are already in Congress that you feel like you could join with?

240
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:04,032
Exactly.

241
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:13,009
The issue of corruption and fixing the Congress is an issue that a lot of politicians have ran on before.

242
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:19,714
However, this time is different because of the new wave of Democrat 2.0 who are running for offices all around the country.

243
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:23,457
It started with Mamdani changing the whole

244
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,084
turning the whole political world in America upside down.

245
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:32,150
And now because of him, a lot of politicians, a lot of new Democrats are running for offices.

246
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:41,062
You have senators, you have running the House at the House level, and they all have this pledge of not taking money from super PACs, from corporate PACs and foreign PACs.

247
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:42,624
And you've never seen this before.

248
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:50,460
And the reason why we've seen it is because they all realized finally that, you know, we can't achieve, you know, Medicare for all.

249
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,242
We can't achieve, you know, universal child care.

250
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:58,727
We can't, you know, end the whole overseas wars if you don't fix corruption in Congress.

251
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:02,871
If you don't fix how we run our campaign, if you don't put term limits, if you don't

252
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:05,068
do all these kind of stuff.

253
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:08,669
And in order to do them, you should not be taking money from these super PACs.

254
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:17,072
And now because of this new wave of Democrats who are running for office, I'm telling you there is hope that we might be able to change the rule of the games.

255
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,272
And I'm going to be part of that coalition.

256
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:21,693
I mean, talk about Rohana in Congress right now.

257
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:29,135
He'd been in the front lines fighting for banning super PACs, fighting for term limits, fighting for all of these issues.

258
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:39,060
And it's funny enough, even when it's come to the Epstein files, he was the one who helped with releasing it, you know, with co-sponsoring a bill with Thomas Macy.

259
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:44,063
And you didn't see that from our own democratic leadership, whether it's Hakeem Jeffrie or Katherine Clark.

260
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:54,909
And the reason is because Hakeem Jeffrie and Katherine Clark basically take a lot of money from these PACs, and they can't, you know, go on their bad side.

261
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:03,436
When you talk about taking money from super PACs, is that money that funds a campaign?

262
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:06,058
Is that money that personally pays these politicians?

263
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,560
Or where does that money go?

264
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:23,652
Usually, so there is this website called Open Secret that usually if you go there, you'll see each Congress representative and which money they, and the money, and you'll see the money that they get and who's paying for it.

265
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:26,455
And there is this, on Instagram, there is this guy,

266
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:37,996
He has this video, I'm probably sure that you saw them, where he said, you know, is your Congress a piece of, you know, and then he tells you their finances and their insider trading history.

267
00:23:38,977 --> 00:23:45,742
And usually if you go to their website, you'll see the super PACs that finance their campaigns.

268
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:53,529
And usually also the super PAC can act independently by creating ads that attack the candidate that they're running against.

269
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:54,750
And we've seen this.

270
00:23:56,951 --> 00:24:03,602
before with the AIPAC and all those pro-Israel PACs, how they create

271
00:24:04,438 --> 00:24:11,422
They do opposition research where you basically find dirt on the candidate that you're running against and then you create ad to fight them.

272
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:14,864
Now usually these super PACs involve a lot with these dirty games.

273
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:15,745
They do a lot of it.

274
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,587
And they also help finance the candidate.

275
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:29,393
So I think there's a limit on PACs money for the candidate, but also on OpenSecret and other websites, they started like, because of all the

276
00:24:31,194 --> 00:24:33,096
the attention that APAC is getting.

277
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:46,545
And because they're trying to find other venues to give money to their own favorite candidate, they usually send it through the dark money side or even through other individuals.

278
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:54,611
And there is this open secret website where it basically shows you these individuals and which PAC they are related to and how much money they give.

279
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:58,374
And of course, it's not just APAC, it's also BlackRock, Amazon,

280
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:04,475
you know, the healthcare industry, the real estate industry.

281
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,836
It's a lot of things.

282
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:06,616
It's a lot of things.

283
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:14,738
And unfortunately, after Citizen United in 2010, so Citizen United, it's a Supreme Court case where basically they said that money is equal to freedom of speech.

284
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:18,179
So you can spend as much money as you want on a candidate.

285
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:26,141
However, what happened afterward is that the target, I think the story was the target supported a candidate who was anti-LGBTQ.

286
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:28,122
And because they did that, they got a lot of pushback.

287
00:25:28,739 --> 00:25:35,042
So in order to find a back avenue so they could support the candidate without getting a pushback, they created these PACs.

288
00:25:36,222 --> 00:25:42,465
So they give money to the PACs, and the PACs do their dirty work, whether they give it to the candidate or create ads that attack their opposition.

289
00:25:49,028 --> 00:26:06,861
The problem with me is I read a lot about the frustration that people get who work in Congress, and I've talked to a lot of people who told me, you know, it's really frustrating, this influence of money on politics, and this whole story about super PACs and money in politics.

290
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:17,407
And you would assume that knowing all of this, that would make me decide not to run for office or decide to shy away from it.

291
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:21,568
But at the same time, as I told you from the beginning, it's the duty of our generation.

292
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:32,372
It's a sense of responsibility that although we inherited this country that's not ideal to our own standard, that doesn't mean we should accept it and let our children inherit it.

293
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,433
No, we should step up and we should fight back.

294
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:45,346
But yeah, and then another funny thing that I always like to talk about when I have this kind of discussion is like, you talk about insider trading, you talk about super PACs, right?

295
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:51,751
And the reason why we talk about them is because we know about them, right?

296
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:58,375
Insider trading didn't become popular until the early 2000s, and then Obama administration was the first one to do something about it.

297
00:26:59,408 --> 00:27:00,749
And the same thing with super PACs.

298
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:03,312
I mean, super PACs got amplified after Citizens United.

299
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:10,338
But my point is, these two things we talk about because we know about, how about the things that we don't know about and we don't talk about?

300
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:12,100
And that's what's really scary.

301
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:20,908
Like, that's what we get surprised of every now and then with, you know, a new scandal, a new Epstein file, a new God knows what.

302
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:23,034
And that's the thing.

303
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:27,335
If you want to enter Congress, you should promise your own constituents that you will be transparent.

304
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:31,316
You will tell them about this whole black box thing that happened in Congress.

305
00:27:31,336 --> 00:27:33,457
You should be more active on social media.

306
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:38,839
And you should tell them exactly what happened and they should know what happened.

307
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,979
That way they send you to Congress.

308
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:45,657
Yeah, that's a lot to think about for sure.

309
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,200
Thanks for explaining some of that stuff.

310
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:49,800
It was helpful.

311
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,383
Are there any other key points of your campaign that you want people to know about?

312
00:27:55,944 --> 00:27:57,025
Yes.

313
00:27:58,366 --> 00:28:02,448
So our campaign is divided into, we have the values and we have the principles.

314
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:04,670
For the values, we believe in three things.

315
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,291
The first one, we need to usher in Democrat 2.0.

316
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:12,635
And that basically means we need a new democratic party where the leaders are strong, united,

317
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:20,661
that doesn't promise change and then deliver excuses, that step up for the people, that put people first.

318
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:23,323
And the second one is we want to make the American dream affordable.

319
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:28,508
We want to make housing as a human right, healthcare for all, education without burden or barriers.

320
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:31,130
And the third one is we want to restore our American

321
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:46,241
values and defend our freedoms, and that means we need to defend our academic freedom, we need to defend our right to protest, we need to defend independent media, and we need to defend the freedom of speech, and we need to defend our immigrants, because an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.

322
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:48,943
So these are our values of the campaign.

323
00:28:49,164 --> 00:28:57,365
And then from these values, we get all of our, we build all the platform around these values.

324
00:28:57,465 --> 00:29:04,467
So I know that usually when I go around, and that's why I want to talk about this, that when I go around, a lot of people will be asking me about various issues.

325
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:05,407
Like, what do you think of that?

326
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:06,127
What do you think of this?

327
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:11,669
And I always tell them about my values, because once you know my values, you'll know my stand on these various issues.

328
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:12,769
And that way I'm talking about it.

329
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:16,653
But yeah, this campaign is all about values.

330
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,254
This campaign is all about the people.

331
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:19,494
It's a grassroots campaign.

332
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,015
It will cost a lot of money.

333
00:29:21,035 --> 00:29:21,995
I'm not delusional.

334
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,836
I know it's going to be an uphill battle.

335
00:29:23,856 --> 00:29:29,718
But at the same time, when I'm faced with these obstacles, the question is not, how do you tackle the obstacle?

336
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:31,638
The question is, is it worth it?

337
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:35,440
You know, those who have a why can tackle anyhow.

338
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,280
And I think it's truly worth it.

339
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,822
And I think that

340
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:46,844
We can't achieve it without the support of the people.

341
00:29:48,425 --> 00:29:49,966
And we need the support of the people.

342
00:29:50,026 --> 00:29:52,227
We need people to be engaged.

343
00:29:52,247 --> 00:30:02,494
We need the people who are cynical and hopeless to believe in this campaign and join us and be part of this change.

344
00:30:03,794 --> 00:30:07,757
And that's the message that I would like for people to know.

345
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:20,120
And it sounds like we're at a point in our, in, you know, the reality of our country right now, where hopefully people are ready for something like that and that people are ready for some hope and something to kind of try to move us forward.

346
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:21,182
Exactly.

347
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:27,827
I always like to ask if there's any events that you want to plug or ways that people can get involved in your campaign.

348
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:40,881
So, with our campaign, we started an exploratory committee last August, and we spent the next couple of months doing coffee hours, but it was more of a private coffee hours where I'll go around and talk to people every Saturday in Cambridge.

349
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:47,945
And now because we filed with the FEC and we're public, we posted on Meetup and we're posting it on our social media accounts.

350
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:49,245
So every Saturday around 11 a.m.

351
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:52,227
in Luxor Cafe in Cambridge, we're having coffee hour.

352
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:56,248
So you can go there and sit down and meet with me.

353
00:30:56,308 --> 00:30:57,809
And we are trying to expand it.

354
00:30:57,929 --> 00:30:59,770
So the idea is I'm trying to

355
00:31:00,768 --> 00:31:08,212
pick local businesses, local coffee shop businesses in my district and turn them into a headquarter for my campaign where I could go there and have coffee hour.

356
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,014
And we usually try to pick ones that next to universities.

357
00:31:11,054 --> 00:31:12,855
So look for cafes next to Harvard.

358
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:15,077
And I'm trying, I'm looking for one in Medford.

359
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:20,040
We have a couple of one in mind, but I'm also trying to expand to other cities.

360
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,063
And the idea is like every Saturday I'll go for an hour and eat to each of these coffee shop and sit down and talk to constituents.

361
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:29,255
For coffee or shy.

362
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:32,137
I mean, we call it shy over change because I don't drink coffee.

363
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:36,278
I don't want to be like, hey, come for coffee hour.

364
00:31:36,358 --> 00:31:37,439
I'm like, are you drinking coffee?

365
00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:38,339
No, I'm drinking shy.

366
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,399
Oh, you lied to us.

367
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,861
But I call it shy.

368
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,381
I call it shy over change because I don't drink coffee.

369
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:49,463
But we call it coffee hour because that's what people think of when it comes to like cozy atmosphere to talk.

370
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:56,242
But yeah, we're doing it in Cambridge right now, and we're going to expand to Medford, Malden, and the other cities.

371
00:31:56,282 --> 00:32:01,010
So if you're listening, if you're outside Medford and you're listening to this podcast,

372
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:02,924
And you have a coffee shop.

373
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:08,206
And even if you're in Medford and you would like to have us for a coffee, I would please reach out to the campaign.

374
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:13,507
tarikforcongress.com, T-A-R-I-K for congress.com is my website.

375
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:22,069
And before ending this, I just want to mention one thing I wanted to talk about from the beginning, which is last month, I went to Medford City Council meeting.

376
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:26,990
And the atmosphere there was really

377
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:40,973
surprising for me, because it didn't feel as like it's a city council meeting, it felt like it was a family gathering, where people know each other, where people are like enjoying the conversation and participating with their own politician.

378
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:52,016
And I remember this instances of like, there's this old lady who was knitting hats for the city council members, and then she brought the UN Charter of Human Rights, and she showed it to them.

379
00:32:52,376 --> 00:32:53,756
And she was like, we should follow this.

380
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:54,636
Oh, my God, this lady, like,

381
00:32:58,117 --> 00:33:10,807
So I remember I went with Micah, you've had him on your podcast before, and I told him, you know, I wish that the meetings in Congress were exactly like this, you know, where it's friendly, everyone is happy, and the people can attend them transparently.

382
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:13,858
So yeah, Metsford, I love you guys.

383
00:33:13,998 --> 00:33:17,361
It sounds like you went to a gentler meeting.

384
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:18,281
They're not always like that.

385
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:26,428
In some families, your uncle will still yell at you across the dinner table or whatever in the city council meeting.

386
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:30,731
I mean, as long as there's no intention to hurt.

387
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:36,953
then you can yell at me as much as you want.

388
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:42,335
If we can have a civil conversation afterward and still lovers and still friends, I'm more than happy.

389
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,415
Yell at me as much as you want.

390
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:48,037
Yeah, it is something that I've learned about the residents of Medford is that

391
00:33:48,577 --> 00:33:50,179
They all care very deeply.

392
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:59,387
They might not necessarily agree what they care about or agree with the end result, but they all have a lot of care for the city and mostly for each other.

393
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:04,352
So it is a good place to kind of see that kind of energy with constituents.

394
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:07,014
That's why I told you from the beginning, it's one of my favorite cities.

395
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:13,380
It should be a role model for the other cities because of how engaged the constituents are with local politics.

396
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:18,938
And I'm hoping that you all, if you're here in this podcast, be engaged in federal politics.

397
00:34:19,218 --> 00:34:20,720
Come and join our coffee hours.

398
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,362
Yeah, no, that's great.

399
00:34:22,382 --> 00:34:22,942
That would be great.

400
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:26,626
Well, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us.

401
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:28,288
Thank you for having me.

402
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:29,829
Yeah, and good luck in the fall.

403
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:31,411
