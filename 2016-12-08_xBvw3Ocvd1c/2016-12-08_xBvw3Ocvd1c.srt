1
00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:08,904
[SPEAKER_09]: the state legislation that would have to be adopted by the city, the school committee, in order to move this into place.

2
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:27,900
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could read the state chapter, general law chapter 71, section 55D, small a, upon the issuance of a musical wind instrument to a student who is permitted to use or borrow the instrument while attending any public or commonwealth charter school or pre-kindergarten to grade 12, inclusive,

3
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:44,660
[SPEAKER_09]: The school issuing the instrument shall inform the student's parent or guardian that the musical wind instrument has been sanitized and may also be sterilized at the expense of the parent or guardian requesting sterilization to ensure that all microbial life has been eradicated from the instrument.

4
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:51,904
[SPEAKER_09]: The parent or guardian may request that the school sterilize the instrument prior to issuance in compliance with regulations promulgated by the Department of Public Health.

5
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:56,706
[SPEAKER_09]: The parent or guardian who makes the request shall be responsible for the entire cost of the sterilization.

6
00:00:57,306 --> 00:01:09,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Small b, this section shall take effect in any city, town, or regional school district upon acceptance by the school committee, or in the case of a Commonwealth charter school, upon acceptance by the Board of Trustees, respectfully submitted by myself, Mayor Stephanie M. Burke.

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

8
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:12,954
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have Solicitor Rumley here.

9
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:15,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if he wanted to say a few words on this topic.

10
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you and good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Bellson, members of the school committee.

11
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,768
[SPEAKER_04]: This statute is what it says.

12
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:31,191
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a matter of notification and information

13
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:35,663
[SPEAKER_04]: to families, families whose students would be borrowing wind instruments.

14
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really very simple.

15
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:53,608
[SPEAKER_04]: What it says is that if a child or a student is borrowing a wind instrument, that they shall receive information that tells them that it's been sanitized, and the parents would also be told that they have the option at their own expense to have it sterilized.

16
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:58,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that's done, then that would have to be done according to the standards of the Department of Public Health.

17
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:06,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a matter of information so that families can better make informed decisions relative to their children.

18
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:11,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I'll speak for the mayor, I would recommend your approval on this matter.

19
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:13,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

20
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:15,683
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

21
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:16,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Wierndekloot.

22
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:17,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

23
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

24
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:21,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

25
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:23,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a couple questions.

26
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:28,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we incur this cost onto the parents, we need to know what the cost is.

27
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:35,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know what we want to do is encourage the most amount of participation in our music programs as we can.

28
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:40,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't want to put an undue hardship on anyone who wants to play.

29
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:51,744
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to know how long the sanitation lasts for, like if someone borrows it and then they turn it back in, is it then re-sanitized before the next student were to borrow it?

30
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,546
[SPEAKER_08]: How that works?

31
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:57,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I really have a lot of questions before we move this forward.

32
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:02,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, well I'm not a clinician, nor am I a doctor, nor am I a scientist of any nature.

33
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:07,577
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the information that I have been reviewing in preparation for tonight,

34
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:16,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just tell you that the suggestion is that an instrument be sanitized once per year as it's given to a child who's borrowing it.

35
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:18,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, excuse me, sterilized.

36
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,153
[SPEAKER_04]: If the family opts to do that, they need not.

37
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:27,818
[SPEAKER_08]: So it just, all right.

38
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:31,881
[SPEAKER_08]: So say I'm a parent and my student wants to play.

39
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:34,303
[SPEAKER_08]: How many wind instruments do we lend on a year?

40
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:36,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

41
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:41,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So I spoke to the music department.

42
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:46,189
[SPEAKER_05]: There are currently 76 wind instruments that have been rented at this time.

43
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of them at the elementary level, there are about 66, another 10 at the middle school level.

44
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:57,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the instruments beyond the middle school are either owned by the individuals or, well, they are owned by the individuals.

45
00:03:57,895 --> 00:04:01,317
[SPEAKER_05]: By that time, they've paid for them if they've worked them up all the way up.

46
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:07,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So we currently have about 76 instruments that are rented in the school system, mostly at the elementary level.

47
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:10,433
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're not borrowed, so they wouldn't come under this ordinance.

48
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:10,973
[SPEAKER_08]: They're rented, yes.

49
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:16,754
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're rented from a private company, but that's not, this wording says borrowed.

50
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:23,235
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very different, because as a parent, I rented a saxophone for years, and you rent it to own it.

51
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:28,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, my son still has it, and I heard him playing it about a month ago when I pulled up, which I was very happy to hear.

52
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,736
[SPEAKER_08]: He rented to own this.

53
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:35,877
[SPEAKER_08]: So when he got it, it was always his.

54
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:46,421
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually was sterilized because in the very beginning, Dr. LaPore provided that to everybody in all the Method students when he was first bringing this program forward.

55
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:48,422
[SPEAKER_08]: So it had been sterilized.

56
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:52,203
[SPEAKER_05]: So Madam Mayor, if I can, the third word is issuance.

57
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not borrow, loan.

58
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:55,505
[SPEAKER_05]: It's issued.

59
00:04:55,925 --> 00:05:01,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Issued from the school department, whether it's issued on a lease purchase or issued as a pure rental.

60
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:16,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So my understanding from reading this, Mr. Belson, was that the school department's inventory of instruments that we were lending out, and I'm like, I didn't know we lent out wind instruments because that's why we had a private company.

61
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:20,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't the private company be responsible for providing clean instruments?

62
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:23,378
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're contracted by the school department to do that.

63
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:24,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

64
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:28,159
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a result, the school department is issuing it through the private company.

65
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:30,527
[SPEAKER_05]: on behalf of the school department.

66
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:33,770
[SPEAKER_08]: At the cost to the parent to have the sterilization.

67
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:45,962
[SPEAKER_05]: If I think I'm correct, I spoke to Mr. Casey, who unfortunately can't be here because he's not feeling well at this point, but he told me that for Medford students, they are issuing it at about $100 for a wind instrument.

68
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:50,228
[SPEAKER_05]: for the year, which is well below market.

69
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:53,310
[SPEAKER_05]: So they issue to another school district.

70
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he says he rents to about 127 different school districts.

71
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:58,393
[SPEAKER_05]: It's $25 a month.

72
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:00,434
[SPEAKER_05]: In Medford, it's $100 for the year.

73
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a very sharp discount for a Medford student, Jack, as a graduate of the high school.

74
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And we obviously feel some obligation.

75
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:14,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is the cost incurred by a parent whose child wants to rent an instrument?

76
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:24,360
[SPEAKER_05]: The last cost I saw for a typical wind instrument, trumpet, a clarinet, something of that type, and please correct me if I'm wrong, was approximately $125 for the process.

77
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that that's the neighborhood, but it is not necessarily the street.

78
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:34,203
[SPEAKER_05]: A larger instrument, for example, a typical kid wouldn't buy a tuba.

79
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:37,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, that's something we would do and then we would have to be responsible for that.

80
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:41,196
[SPEAKER_08]: So I understand the importance of this.

81
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:48,120
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the health, the health piece and why it's important to have this done.

82
00:06:48,920 --> 00:07:02,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so if I had a child who went in the fifth grade and picked a wind instrument, they would pay the a hundred dollars a year to rent to own this instrument until they paid it off typically, right?

83
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:03,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Which,

84
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:10,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Our saxophone back then was like seven, $800 total through the lifetime at that time.

85
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:16,825
[SPEAKER_08]: And then another $125 for have it sanitized when they initially get sterilized.

86
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:17,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

87
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:20,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Sterilized parents chose for that option.

88
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:22,968
[SPEAKER_08]: So what would this mean?

89
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:29,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Only we have to inform them that they have the option to or that they have to, there are two elements of the information.

90
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:32,253
[SPEAKER_04]: The first information is on the notice.

91
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:37,159
[SPEAKER_04]: The first information that they receive is that the instrument has been sanitized.

92
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:41,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the parents so choose, it may be sterilized.

93
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they do choose that option, then it would be done at their expense.

94
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:47,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

95
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:57,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is entirely the effect of this from a legal point of view, from a functional point of view or an administrative point of view is for the school department.

96
00:07:57,823 --> 00:08:01,884
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the city to provide notice to family.

97
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:06,166
[SPEAKER_08]: that it's not been sterilized and they have that option.

98
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:11,090
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're by no means mandating this in any way or encouraging it.

99
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,653
[SPEAKER_08]: It's each individual's choice.

100
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:15,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Notification.

101
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:16,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

102
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:27,905
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, were I a parent of a child in the school system borrowing an instrument, myself and my wife would garner the information that we could about sanitation and sterilization, and then we'd make a choice.

103
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:30,667
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really what families should do.

104
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:33,215
[SPEAKER_04]: make choices that benefit their children.

105
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:41,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what the government, that's what the school department should be doing, to assist them to fully and functionally make that choice.

106
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:46,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

107
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:46,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Van der Kloot.

108
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:49,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I just did have a question about the cost.

109
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:53,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was significantly lower when you and I talked, Mr. Superintendent.

110
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,953
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people here who would like to address the specifics such as cost.

111
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:00,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

112
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:01,864
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the number I get.

113
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:05,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Stone, would you like to comment now or do you want to wait for an answer?

114
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:08,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think they're going to speak and someone could speak on the cost.

115
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:12,706
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

116
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:13,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

117
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,287
[SPEAKER_18]: Victor Garrow, lawyer, Medford.

118
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:20,148
[SPEAKER_18]: I am a consultant for Dr. Lepore and his company.

119
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:24,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, Mr. Belzer, can I ask you where you got that figure of $125?

120
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:24,749
[SPEAKER_18]: I got that from Jack Casey.

121
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,715
[SPEAKER_18]: How could he, he doesn't, he doesn't sterilize instruments though.

122
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:31,915
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but that's what he told me.

123
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:33,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked him what the cost would be.

124
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,076
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, that's what it would be.

125
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:38,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, he can't sterilize because there's only, there's only one person that gets sterilized and that's his company.

126
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say he could sterilize.

127
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:43,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked him what he thought the cost was since he did, you know, I thought he would know.

128
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:44,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, he's way off.

129
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:45,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wrong.

130
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:46,619
[SPEAKER_05]: He's way off.

131
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:48,899
[SPEAKER_18]: So therefore let me, I will answer your question.

132
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mr. Belson, just to remind you, the other day when you and I talked, you may have forgotten this, but you told me it was about $40 per instrument.

133
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:59,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember that, but if it's, if it's less, it's less.

134
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:00,967
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much less.

135
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:01,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

136
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:01,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

137
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:10,556
[SPEAKER_18]: The, uh, you know, what's interesting, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee is that everybody knows Dr. Lepore.

138
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:18,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody could have called up Dr. Lepore and say, how much does it cost to have an instrument sterilized?

139
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:23,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Now let me explain a little bit about the term sterilization.

140
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:41,539
[SPEAKER_18]: You will notice that in the statute itself, the state, now this is not us, this is the state, is stating that if you have a sanitized wind instrument, that does not kill all the germs within the instrument.

141
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:47,681
[SPEAKER_18]: There is only one way you can kill all microbial life as stated

142
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,026
[SPEAKER_18]: in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts statute.

143
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:52,147
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is by sterilization.

144
00:10:53,408 --> 00:11:05,073
[SPEAKER_18]: So that when a parent makes the decision of, do I want to have it sterilized or not, but they have to have some information, such as, what type of germs are found within some of these instruments?

145
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:08,775
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, there's been several tests.

146
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,996
[SPEAKER_18]: There have been several reports.

147
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:13,317
[SPEAKER_18]: And it seems a lot of people haven't read them.

148
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:15,779
[SPEAKER_18]: And what it stated is this.

149
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:20,200
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want everybody that's listening on TV to understand what we're saying here.

150
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:29,407
[SPEAKER_18]: That in these instruments, one of the things that has been found by the doctors who have done these and the research people is, they find mold.

151
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:39,506
[SPEAKER_18]: I want any doctor to come up here and say that it is perfectly healthy for a child to inhale mold.

152
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:44,409
[SPEAKER_18]: What happens in the school system, Madam Mayor, Mr. Belzin, when you find mold?

153
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:48,411
[SPEAKER_18]: You shut down the school, you break down the walls, you get all that mold.

154
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,972
[SPEAKER_18]: Mold is going into their mouth and into their system.

155
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:56,595
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the gateway to your health or not healthy, is here through your mouth.

156
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:06,425
[SPEAKER_18]: And so what happens is the microbial germs that are there do not get killed unless you sterilize.

157
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:17,955
[SPEAKER_18]: And sterilization is done by ethylene oxide, which is used in 50 to 60% of all medical instruments in the United States.

158
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:27,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything that is put into a person's heart, into their body, is sterilized with ethylene oxide.

159
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:34,732
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is the only way that you can kill all microbial life in an instrument.

160
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:36,174
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what does it.

161
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:47,283
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's done pursuant to the EPA and the FDA, always looking at the places that do this to the instruments to make sure that it's safe.

162
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:54,453
[SPEAKER_18]: There has never been a problem ever with the sterilization of ethylene oxide.

163
00:12:55,174 --> 00:13:00,057
[SPEAKER_18]: There's been a lot of misinformation out here that I'm very privy to.

164
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:06,022
[SPEAKER_18]: And I will say to you that it's shocking what's happened.

165
00:13:06,923 --> 00:13:10,766
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I'm up here speaking today, because it's not going to end.

166
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:15,610
[SPEAKER_18]: There's been something going on behind the scenes that I will get to the bottom of.

167
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:20,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I think there's some hidden agendas involved with this.

168
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:23,699
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've been a lawyer for a lot of years.

169
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:25,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Mayor.

170
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:26,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Mr. Garrow.

171
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:26,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

172
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:27,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

173
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:33,601
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you've said a lot of things and I need to tell you that as a school committee member.

174
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:39,082
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, because I know many of the people who are involved in this company and have known them over years.

175
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:43,650
[SPEAKER_10]: because of their professional positions in Medford and as Medford residents.

176
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:50,095
[SPEAKER_10]: That in fact, in my eyes, the way to look at this statute is to say, what does the statute say?

177
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:54,679
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, if you would, divorce myself from the people involved.

178
00:13:55,439 --> 00:14:04,987
[SPEAKER_10]: The statute says that we should be telling parents that there is a option for sanitation, period.

179
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:05,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Sterilization.

180
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:06,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

181
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:07,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Sterilization.

182
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:08,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Period.

183
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:08,747
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

184
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,028
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the statute says.

185
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:14,351
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I understand us to be voting on tonight is simply, are we going to accept it?

186
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:26,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And then incumbent on us is to let parents know whose children are renting instruments, um, uh, that they should be, um, that, that there is this option and it is an option.

187
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:28,002
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm voting on.

188
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:34,607
[SPEAKER_10]: If I have some blinders on, it's purposeful because I don't want to get involved with personalities or, or whatever.

189
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:37,445
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's, for me, it's a clear cut.

190
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:38,486
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a statute.

191
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:41,948
[SPEAKER_10]: It says that this would be, that's what the legislature has told us.

192
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:45,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any hidden agenda.

193
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,310
[SPEAKER_18]: No, you don't.

194
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,172
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly correct interpretation.

195
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:50,173
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way- Ms.

196
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:50,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone?

197
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:51,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

198
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:51,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone?

199
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:52,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

200
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:53,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, how are you?

201
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:59,258
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have gone to the high school three times for my oldest three to try out instruments to see what they would like to do.

202
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:06,979
[SPEAKER_17]: We send the audit form in, and then the instrument arrives at the Roberts Elementary School in my, well now they're eighth, sixth, and fifth.

203
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,800
[SPEAKER_17]: They pick up their instrument, and I don't have to worry about picking up, dropping off.

204
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,540
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very nicely done.

205
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:15,321
[SPEAKER_17]: So how does the sterilization work into it?

206
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:20,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Would the rental company bring them to your company, and then bring them back to the elementary school?

207
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:26,904
[SPEAKER_18]: What has happened in the past, Dr. Lepore did this for three years here within the city, 2006, 2007, and 2008.

208
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:43,662
[SPEAKER_18]: And at that time, all instruments, I believe you believe you were for that at that time, Mr. Bellson, that the instruments that all instruments from the city were done free of charge by Dr. Lepore's company, not one penny.

209
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:46,564
[SPEAKER_18]: What was charged is to Mr. Casey.

210
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:50,507
[SPEAKER_18]: He was charged $40 per instrument approximately.

211
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:55,331
[SPEAKER_18]: And he added on $35 for his, his handling and his profit.

212
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:58,633
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's done over a nine or 10 month period of time.

213
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,075
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would add maybe $6 or $7 on to the leasing agreement on a lease to buy.

214
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:17,166
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you had a clarinet and you were leasing it for $30, the parent then could be told it'll probably cost you $38 to make sure that there is no microbial life or germs within your instrument.

215
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:21,350
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be up to the parent to decide.

216
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:24,115
[SPEAKER_17]: but as a parent, I don't have to pick it up, bring it to you.

217
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:24,675
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no.

218
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:25,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

219
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:29,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Because that would be, that would be, that would be, that'd be done with Mr. Bellson and the school committee.

220
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:32,067
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean the, the, uh, school department.

221
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:36,734
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, yes, the school department and the people that are there at the music part.

222
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:39,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

223
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,580
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

224
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot, Mr. Benedetto.

225
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

226
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:48,662
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're saying it's $40 for this?

227
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:56,805
[SPEAKER_18]: It would approximately- About $40, and then another $35 for the- It's probably in the vicinity of $70 to $75 for the whole thing.

228
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:57,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

229
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:00,446
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's an option for parents?

230
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:01,166
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

231
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:06,048
[SPEAKER_08]: So for health reasons, how often should parents

232
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:09,729
[SPEAKER_08]: get the instruments re-sterilized.

233
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:21,557
[SPEAKER_18]: On the studies that have been done, the standard is that when it goes from one student to the next and before it's given out to the next student, it should be then sterilized.

234
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:25,740
[SPEAKER_18]: So at the beginning of the school year, it should be sterilized for that student for the year.

235
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:33,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happens when you rent to own is you keep that same instrument for seven or eight years and then you own it.

236
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:35,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm asking.

237
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:37,757
[SPEAKER_18]: Every year, you should do.

238
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:45,860
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if the school committee knows of this, but it's been said many times, gee, no one's got sick, why should we be doing this?

239
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:52,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, a person just died from self-contamination of a musical wind instrument.

240
00:17:53,243 --> 00:17:55,404
[SPEAKER_18]: Died from it in England.

241
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:58,245
[SPEAKER_18]: And what happened was, the man died in 2014.

242
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:04,139
[SPEAKER_18]: And he had spent seven or eight years in coughing and with problems.

243
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:05,919
[SPEAKER_18]: He was getting weaker and weaker.

244
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,841
[SPEAKER_18]: The doctors over in England that were treating him in the hospital couldn't figure out what was wrong.

245
00:18:11,242 --> 00:18:15,363
[SPEAKER_18]: So they were giving him all types of medications that were known to them to try to help.

246
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:16,484
[SPEAKER_18]: It didn't.

247
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:17,704
[SPEAKER_18]: He was dying.

248
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:20,886
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's self, it was self-contamination.

249
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:24,287
[SPEAKER_18]: It didn't go from person to student to student to student.

250
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:28,709
[SPEAKER_18]: You can self-contaminate your own wind instrument.

251
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:40,207
[SPEAKER_18]: So therefore, I'm telling everybody that has an instrument, if you have an instrument, you should have it sterilized once a year because you can self-contaminate your own instrument.

252
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:46,311
[SPEAKER_18]: And by the way, when people say they haven't been getting sick, let me tell you the sicknesses that it causes.

253
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:48,152
[SPEAKER_18]: It can cause flu.

254
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:49,772
[SPEAKER_18]: It can cause the virus.

255
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,213
[SPEAKER_18]: It can cause headaches.

256
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:52,554
[SPEAKER_18]: It can cause coughing.

257
00:18:52,954 --> 00:18:54,375
[SPEAKER_18]: It can cause diarrhea.

258
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,096
[SPEAKER_18]: It can cause headaches.

259
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:57,556
[SPEAKER_18]: It can cause asthma.

260
00:18:57,816 --> 00:18:59,097
[SPEAKER_18]: It can cause bronchitis.

261
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,538
[SPEAKER_18]: It can cause feeling sick.

262
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:04,560
[SPEAKER_18]: It can cause ear problems.

263
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,862
[SPEAKER_18]: And all of these things over the years, no one has ever put the dots to say, hey, you know something?

264
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,124
[SPEAKER_18]: This might have come from the musical instrument.

265
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:16,246
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, now you can start thinking, I was saying, if the state

266
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:18,507
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's been several hearings on this.

267
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:27,412
[SPEAKER_18]: The state has said that the only way to ensure that all microbial life has been eradicated within the instrument is through sterilization.

268
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,973
[SPEAKER_18]: That's our Commonwealth of Massachusetts saying that.

269
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:31,634
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not our company that's saying that.

270
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:33,375
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the Commonwealth of Mass.

271
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:41,320
[SPEAKER_18]: So therefore, what happens here is all we're saying here is give notice to the parents and let them make that decision themselves.

272
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,701
[SPEAKER_18]: But just understand.

273
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:44,962
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of people have got sick.

274
00:19:45,463 --> 00:19:46,203
[SPEAKER_18]: One has died.

275
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:53,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, the only reason why they were able to find out why he died was the following.

276
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,531
[SPEAKER_18]: In 2014, he died.

277
00:19:55,151 --> 00:20:01,216
[SPEAKER_18]: But there were six or seven doctors over in England at this hospital who were doing work for him.

278
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:06,401
[SPEAKER_18]: And the medical examiner said he died of a lung condition.

279
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:08,667
[SPEAKER_18]: They said, no, no, no, no.

280
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:10,868
[SPEAKER_18]: There's something more wrong with this than that.

281
00:20:11,488 --> 00:20:13,249
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to determine what really happened.

282
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,232
[SPEAKER_18]: It took them two years, Madam Mayor, of research to find out what happened.

283
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:28,098
[SPEAKER_18]: So what they did is they finally went into the gentleman's home with the consent of the family, and they found this bagpipe wind instrument.

284
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:35,863
[SPEAKER_18]: And they said, you know something, let's take that for our researchers and let them go and check out what was going on and what was wrong in the instrument.

285
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:38,466
[SPEAKER_18]: What they found, they couldn't believe.

286
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:45,910
[SPEAKER_18]: There was all types of mold, fungi, and all other things that cause real serious problems.

287
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,751
[SPEAKER_18]: The poor man died from this.

288
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:49,272
[SPEAKER_18]: He died from it.

289
00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:55,396
[SPEAKER_18]: So when we're saying this, but if these doctors didn't work for two years,

290
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:04,267
[SPEAKER_18]: to figure out what was going on, it would have been another undocumented death that wouldn't be related to musical wind instruments.

291
00:21:04,948 --> 00:21:06,269
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen.

292
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:13,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Sir, getting back to my question, I just want people to be aware that the recommendation is to have it sterilized every year.

293
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:18,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And rather the first year, you get your instrument from the rental company.

294
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:20,963
[SPEAKER_08]: At that point,

295
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:28,293
[SPEAKER_08]: If you brought it yourself back to the company to have it sterilized, it would be an additional $40 each year.

296
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:34,037
[SPEAKER_18]: But it would seem to me that this would be done through the school itself.

297
00:21:34,097 --> 00:21:43,043
[SPEAKER_08]: So then we're putting regulations on our music department that is already working understaffed.

298
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,424
[SPEAKER_08]: to take on this responsibility and I'd like to hear from the superintendent about that.

299
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:48,765
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no problem with this.

300
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:49,826
[SPEAKER_18]: What responsibility?

301
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:56,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Of collecting all these 75 instruments, transporting them back to Dr. Lepore's business and having them sterilized.

302
00:21:56,473 --> 00:21:58,034
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we would be picking up, we'd be picking up.

303
00:21:58,054 --> 00:22:02,499
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not, this is not, by the way, I think there was a misstatement by Mr. Belson.

304
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:07,103
[SPEAKER_18]: There are not 76 instruments being used in the high school by people in the band.

305
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:14,126
[SPEAKER_18]: We're talking about those that Mr. Casey has because he is leasing instruments.

306
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:16,208
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not what the statute is saying.

307
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:22,474
[SPEAKER_18]: Statute is talking about what the school, you don't issue it through Mr. Casey.

308
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:34,263
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Mr. Casey's business and he has business with the city and you as the city can say, if you are giving any of these least instruments to our people, we want you to sterilize them first.

309
00:22:34,743 --> 00:22:39,247
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you're out of all the problems because he has to handle them or the company has to handle them.

310
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,029
[SPEAKER_18]: He has thousands of instruments.

311
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:44,292
[SPEAKER_18]: He can put them to all the way and there's no other problems.

312
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:49,074
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we do that, then we're taking out the option of the parents' choice to have that done.

313
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:49,874
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they make that choice.

314
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:51,455
[SPEAKER_09]: This is informational to the parents.

315
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:53,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Notification to the parents.

316
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:54,916
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what this general law is.

317
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:58,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Providing notification to the parents and then it's up to them to take action.

318
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:02,339
[SPEAKER_09]: If they so please, they may look up research and disagree with the findings.

319
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:04,280
[SPEAKER_09]: It's totally at the parents' wishes.

320
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

321
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

322
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:10,242
[SPEAKER_10]: The one concern that I do have is I think that it's incumbent on

323
00:23:11,214 --> 00:23:17,282
[SPEAKER_10]: us that we want to make sure that the flyer which is going out to the parents is acceptable to us.

324
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it probably should have a website for the parents attached to it for more information.

325
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:29,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to scare every parent thinking that their kid now is going to die if they don't do this.

326
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:36,678
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we want to let them know that it is an option for them and consistent with the statute.

327
00:23:37,118 --> 00:23:38,418
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to make sure.

328
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:47,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen a flyer yet that would go out to the parent, but rather than that flyer going directly to the music company or through whatever,

329
00:23:47,422 --> 00:23:51,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to make sure that we have administrative oversight of that flyer.

330
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:53,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

331
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:55,765
[SPEAKER_05]: So, let's clarify a few things.

332
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:11,130
[SPEAKER_05]: The statute says that when the school department issues something for a student to use or borrow, to use or borrow, not own, to use or borrow, then we have to notify parents of this option.

333
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:16,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it's incumbent upon us to give them

334
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:26,135
[SPEAKER_05]: The pros, maybe some cons if there are, as to why they would or wouldn't do this, the pricing, and to tell them how it works and how to access it.

335
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:38,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, as far as the school department doing it, if we set up a system where people can bring their instruments to us so we can give them to the appropriate company, that's easily done.

336
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:40,116
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not difficult to do.

337
00:24:40,956 --> 00:24:42,296
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have a problem doing that.

338
00:24:42,976 --> 00:24:48,718
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue is really more of setting up a system, providing appropriate flyer, which I'll provide to you.

339
00:24:49,378 --> 00:24:52,939
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have one issue, and maybe an attorney can enlighten us on this one.

340
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:57,225
[SPEAKER_05]: is to whether or not there's more than one company, because obviously we have bid laws.

341
00:24:57,986 --> 00:24:59,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there one more than one company at this time?

342
00:24:59,667 --> 00:24:59,868
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

343
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:02,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, saying if we put something out, this might be a sole source.

344
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's a sole source, we put that out there.

345
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:11,778
[SPEAKER_05]: But if another source were to show up, we would have to, over time, explain that to people that they have that option as well.

346
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:15,782
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the interim, it's not a difficult thing to do.

347
00:25:16,402 --> 00:25:18,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that we want to provide appropriate notification

348
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing wrong with providing appropriate notification.

349
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:23,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And people can make up their own mind.

350
00:25:24,512 --> 00:25:27,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they believe that this is in their best interest, then fine.

351
00:25:27,713 --> 00:25:31,634
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't believe it's in their best interest, then that's a choice they can make.

352
00:25:32,374 --> 00:25:34,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we're involved with.

353
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:36,776
[SPEAKER_05]: The statute is not a difficult one to accept.

354
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:41,198
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really a question of how we have people access it.

355
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:43,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree, Mr. Bilson.

356
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:45,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to suggest we move the question.

357
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to move the question.

358
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:56,117
[SPEAKER_02]: roll call please.

359
00:25:56,498 --> 00:25:56,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

00:25:56,778 --> 00:25:56,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

00:25:57,579 --> 00:25:57,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_09]: Six in the affirmative.

363
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,342
[SPEAKER_09]: None of the negative one absent motion passes.

364
00:26:02,123 --> 00:26:02,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you madam mayor.

365
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:03,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

366
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:03,324

[SPEAKER_09]: There is none.

394
00:26:57,756 --> 00:26:58,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of committees.

[SPEAKER_09]: None.

00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Community participation.

397
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, may I ask?

398
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:05,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

399
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:06,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Vander Kloof.

400
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:12,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it make any sense to suspend the rules to pick up the adoption of Medford Conversations Project?

401
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:18,373
[SPEAKER_09]: We're actually waiting for one individual to come, and as soon as he arrives, I would love you to make that motion.

402
00:27:18,393 --> 00:27:19,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he's actually in the back of the room.

403
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:23,958
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion for suspension of the rules to take the resolution under new business.

404
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:26,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Resolution submitted by Mayor Stephanie M. Burke.

405
00:27:26,956 --> 00:27:34,460
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford School Committee support the Medford Conversations Project to promote dialogue and collaboration about race and ethnicity in Medford and beyond.

406
00:27:35,061 --> 00:27:37,982
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's actually a full resolution that's in your packet.

407
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:44,066
[SPEAKER_09]: It was presented to the city council last Tuesday evening, and it passed 7 to 0.

408
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:46,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could read the resolution.

409
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:54,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the strength of our nation is derived from its history of diversity that has enriched our communities with a variety of cultures, faiths, traditions, and viewpoints.

410
00:27:55,112 --> 00:28:00,513
[SPEAKER_09]: And whereas the City of Medford is a community that welcomes and values the varied racial and ethnic makeup of our residents.

411
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:06,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And whereas the City of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups and newcomers as they pursue the American dream.

412
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:16,637
[SPEAKER_09]: And whereas the City of Medford will work to model our city as a safe and welcoming place that equally encourages all to seek personal advancement and to reside in peaceful contentment in Medford.

413
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:27,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the city of Medford rejects all words and acts of hate, indifference, and intolerance that undermine our neighborhoods, communities of faith, and our schools, and thwart the promise of equal justice.

414
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:36,712
[SPEAKER_09]: And whereas our nation was founded on the fundamental principle that all persons are entitled to equal protection of law, equal opportunity, and to the enjoyment of civil and human rights.

415
00:28:37,253 --> 00:28:46,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, therefore, the city of Medford proudly supports the Medford Conversations Project to promote dialogue and collaboration about race and ethnicity in Medford and beyond.

416
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:53,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe we have Mr. D. O'Brien in the audience, and Reverend Wendy, would you like to speak on this resolution?

417
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:59,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Reverend Wendy, your name and address for the record, please?

418
00:28:59,828 --> 00:29:03,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Reverend Wendy Miller-Olapade, 105 Brooks Street, Medford.

419
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:04,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the... Welcome.

420
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:05,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

421
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:06,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

422
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:12,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so delighted to be with you tonight on behalf of the Medford Conversations Project

423
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:34,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the lead pastor of Sanctuary United Church of Christ and I'm participating in the planning team of the Medford Conversations Project as a member of the Medford Interfaith Clergy Association and a member of Medford Health Matters, which reflects a little bit about the diversity of the bodies that are engaged in planning for that project.

424
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:40,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm here just to speak to what the project is and answer any questions.

425
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:43,007
[SPEAKER_01]: We have others here if you have further questions.

426
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:52,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford Conversations' mission is to include and actively engage a wide range, a multiplicity of voices in our community, and through those conversations,

427
00:29:53,290 --> 00:30:00,491
[SPEAKER_01]: hope to encourage people to create and act on visions for a sustainable, just, and thriving Medford.

428
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:21,955
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of a model based on the everyday democracy way of creating conversations across diverse networks in communities, we hope to bring people together to talk about what they care about, to make Medford a better place to be,

429
00:30:23,182 --> 00:30:36,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actively seeking to bring people from across different cultures, races, religions, economic background, neighborhoods, generations.

430
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:47,916
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're actively trying to get people into the room for our first conversation, which is in January, designed to discuss who belongs.

431
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:50,558
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a dialogue about race and ethnicity

432
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:52,269
[SPEAKER_01]: in Medford and beyond.

433
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:55,370
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me stop there and see if you have any questions.

434
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've heard about this yet.

435
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:04,474
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little handout for you if you'd like to, it's just the invitation to the actual first event.

436
00:31:04,854 --> 00:31:15,740
[SPEAKER_01]: The intention is that the conversations project would be a model that we would continue to use to address different topics as time goes on.

437
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Reverend Wendy.

438
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:23,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak on this resolution before us this evening?

439
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:28,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

440
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:29,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Your name and address, please.

441
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:31,540
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Steve Schnapp.

442
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,181
[SPEAKER_11]: The last name is spelled S-E-H-N-A-P-P.

443
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:37,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at 36 Hillside Ave, right up the street from the library.

444
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:39,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I got involved in this project.

445
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:44,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm retired, but I got involved in this project because I think it's particularly important

446
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:50,017
[SPEAKER_11]: that folks across difference, as Reverend Wendy explained, engage with each other.

447
00:31:50,597 --> 00:32:06,201
[SPEAKER_11]: And the only point I would like to add to what's been said already is in addition to your support, we actually need your help in being able to attract folks who may not have what I would call a racial justice frame.

448
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:21,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Folks who may be leery to participate because they don't want to get beat up or called a racist or in some way feel bad about the particular views they may hold.

449
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:27,765
[SPEAKER_11]: We really want to engage people across difference and that is political difference and the way they see the world.

450
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:43,654
[SPEAKER_11]: This conversation is an attempt to get to know people, for people to get to know each other, to build relationships, and therefore to begin to address the very important issues of race and diversity and ethnicity, et cetera, that are dividing us.

451
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,216
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an attempt to get folks to talk to each other.

452
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:52,261
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need your help to identify and help us bring those folks into these conversations.

453
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:59,507
[SPEAKER_11]: We're asking that of all sorts of organizations across the city, individuals, political folks, but others as well.

454
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:05,896
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there are folks that you can think of who may be civic-minded or not,

455
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:26,124
[SPEAKER_11]: but want to engage in conversations that may be difficult but will be facilitated so that all voices can be heard and respected, we really invite you to share those individuals with us or hand out literature that just tells about what this program is and this project.

456
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:26,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

457
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:29,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

458
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:29,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Mestone.

459
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:31,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

460
00:33:33,988 --> 00:33:34,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

461
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:36,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

462
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:39,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give you electronic versions of it.

463
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

464
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,871
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a desire for registration, but people can just show up as well to the opening thing.

465
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:57,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much time you want me to spend, but the design beyond the philosophy that this is a way

466
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:02,130
[SPEAKER_01]: to help people to stay engaged in their civic connections.

467
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:25,685
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way to really make sure that we're still being a democracy and that people, so one of the things we didn't say specifically is that Steve and Jen Bailey actually are leading the team that is gonna do training, so our facilitators will be trained by Everyday Democracy to be able to engage hot topics, if you will, some of those topics

468
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:29,743
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to talk about it over the Thanksgiving dinner table, right?

469
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:33,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot topics that are hard to talk about when you have a difference of opinion.

470
00:34:34,325 --> 00:34:42,527
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have trained facilitators who will facilitate those conversations across difference, and it'll happen in small groups.

471
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:54,551
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a large opening event that will sort of set the stage and set expectations for what we hope to happen, and then there will be small groups of 10 to 12 persons who will gather together

472
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:02,992
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule with facilitators who will then dig deeper, listen to each other, and dig deeper on the topics.

473
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:08,454
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we come back together for a fifth session on this particular topic.

474
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:16,417
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hopeful that those facilitators will allow then for the improved dialogue across difference.

475
00:35:18,322 --> 00:35:19,943
[SPEAKER_01]: high school age is appropriate.

476
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:22,444
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still negotiating.

477
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:23,665
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still in conversation.

478
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:30,028
[SPEAKER_01]: We're learning how to do this as we're going along by the grace of the goodness of good people.

479
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:33,950
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not confident yet.

480
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally we thought it would be

481
00:35:36,431 --> 00:35:40,975
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kids and adults and elders all in one circle.

482
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:50,163
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've just recently talked about recognizing that a room full of, you know, a couple of youth in a group with a lot of voices might be hard for them to be heard.

483
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:54,226
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still trying to figure out whether we might do some small groups just for them.

484
00:35:54,826 --> 00:36:01,372
[SPEAKER_01]: My 16-year-old is here because this is a topic that we talked about at the city council meeting last week.

485
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:11,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recognized that there was nobody in the room when we were talking about it, either of color or of difference or young people.

486
00:36:11,331 --> 00:36:20,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked him to come tonight to, you know, sort of just be in the room with me as we talked about this because, you know, we think that it's all okay.

487
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:25,814
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to believe that this is the kind of community that we are and this is what we stand for.

488
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:27,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet young people,

489
00:36:28,218 --> 00:36:41,823
[SPEAKER_01]: old people, people of color, people, Muslim people, we all know that we've struggled over the last year or so, and that there's an increase in fear and concern expressed by our community after the results of the election, frankly.

490
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:55,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think it is appropriate for teenagers, and we're trying to figure, we're working with Amie Saulnier, she's on the steering committee, and she's working really hard to make sure that the kids at this school are engaged.

491
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:59,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to convince Aaron to be a facilitator actually.

492
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:00,935
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm going public with it.

493
00:37:04,437 --> 00:37:07,078
[SPEAKER_01]: That website, yep, that website is on the home page.

494
00:37:07,118 --> 00:37:09,800
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the bottom, there's a whole registration process there.

495
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,621
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you can get the flyer from the website too.

496
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:15,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Medfordconversations.org.

497
00:37:15,362 --> 00:37:16,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

498
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:17,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for being here tonight.

499
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:18,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

500
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,362
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor for acceptance of the resolution by Ms.

501
00:37:24,382 --> 00:37:24,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

502
00:37:25,182 --> 00:37:25,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second?

503
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:28,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

504
00:37:30,145 --> 00:37:30,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

505
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:45,134
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to me that our community has really, in general, in my understanding of it, meets a lot of these items listed as a resolution.

506
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:50,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas, I think the program is wonderful and I agree that it should be

507
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:55,839
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, engaged by many of our community members.

508
00:37:56,919 --> 00:38:03,941
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way we can have straightforward, honest discussion about any issue that might be the topic at that time.

509
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,361
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do encourage people to do that.

510
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:13,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know why it goes from a method conversations to a resolution.

511
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:21,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I really feel that our community is very open and welcoming already without putting it forward in this manner.

512
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:23,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just didn't, I just didn't.

513
00:38:25,117 --> 00:38:32,860
[SPEAKER_09]: It's to provide a unified voice that we will not accept acts of hatred and inequality.

514
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,260
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not who we are.

515
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,380
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not who we want to be.

516
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:38,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And that we all speak united on that topic.

517
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:39,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

518
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:39,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I,

519
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:44,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I see that, but I feel like our community already does that in so many ways on a daily basis.

520
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:47,052
[SPEAKER_09]: You see that a lot, but there are a lot that don't.

521
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:52,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And to those out there, we're making a statement that it's important that we acknowledge that.

522
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:53,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent?

523
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:55,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent?

524
00:38:56,597 --> 00:39:09,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, and Reverend, I think it's really important, given the climate that sometimes pervades our world, that we reemphasize not only to ourselves as adults, but to

525
00:39:10,468 --> 00:39:12,709
[SPEAKER_05]: the students that this is important to us.

526
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:20,054
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the adults make a motion of this type, you're sending a message to the young people who perhaps have not thought it through as much.

527
00:39:21,015 --> 00:39:26,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's important for us to be able to say this is something that the adults have taken an active stand on.

528
00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:37,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another reason for doing it in a public body and especially in a school system where we have the care and responsibility of educating our young people about how to get along.

529
00:39:38,447 --> 00:39:40,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've talked a lot about social and emotional health.

530
00:39:41,348 --> 00:39:43,009
[SPEAKER_05]: We've talked a lot about some of the issues.

531
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:46,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to tell you, the academic issues will take care of themselves over the years.

532
00:39:47,050 --> 00:40:01,895
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones that won't are the social and emotional and the personal interactions of young people if we don't step up as role models and if we don't step up as voices to help them find voice as they grow up.

533
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:06,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So to help them with their transition to adulthood, it's critical that we take

534
00:40:07,877 --> 00:40:12,858
[SPEAKER_05]: visible stance on human issues, human rights, and human fairness.

535
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:23,000
[SPEAKER_06]: So my only point was to say that I feel our schools district already does an exceptional job of making all our students feel welcome.

536
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we do.

537
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with you.

538
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,382
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I just wanted to say that I didn't want people to hear this and think that we have to make a resolution for these things to happen.

539
00:40:32,402 --> 00:40:33,862
[SPEAKER_06]: This happens on a daily basis.

540
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:43,310
[SPEAKER_06]: by the educators, our administrators, by our community, and by everybody here that we really care and we look at children.

541
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:48,256
[SPEAKER_06]: That's children that we educate all and we support all in any needs that they need them.

542
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:50,558
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was my concern.

543
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want people to say that this is something new, this is something I know.

544
00:40:54,863 --> 00:41:02,971
[SPEAKER_07]: It's our way of making a public statement that that is who we are.

545
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:03,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

546
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Van der Kloot.

547
00:41:12,495 --> 00:41:19,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And I understand, Erin, exactly what you're trying to say, that we've been a positive place and we want to keep on staying that way.

548
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,181
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why we're going to go ahead and say this.

549
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:27,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to tell you, and neither of these incidents happened inside or with anybody involved in Medford.

550
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:34,971
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have been shocked within the last two months of two very different incidents that were so outrageous to me personally of

551
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:39,576
[SPEAKER_10]: discrimination and, uh, inappropriate hate.

552
00:41:40,176 --> 00:41:45,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and one was, you know, I went to a craft show and I don't want to go into it here.

553
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:52,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Although if anybody wants to know, I'll, I'll talk to you personally about what happened and something else which happened with words that were totally inappropriate.

554
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:58,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And somehow I feel that in the political climate that took place over the past year, it is unleashed a firestorm.

555
00:41:58,523 --> 00:42:03,325
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this is the appropriate time to go public and just to reaffirm our values.

556
00:42:03,994 --> 00:42:04,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

557
00:42:04,474 --> 00:42:04,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Vandekloot.

558
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:10,057
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, the superintendent and I are working on a PSA, trying to get the community involved.

559
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,098
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll probably be reaching out to Steve.

560
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:19,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I sat at your table several months ago, and he did a great job facilitating that meeting.

561
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:28,525
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll be working probably with some in your group to try and put a PSA out that addresses some of these issues in a conversational forum of four people, maybe.

562
00:42:28,866 --> 00:42:31,407
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be in touch with you in the very near future for that.

563
00:42:32,937 --> 00:42:52,390
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing I want to share, I did this the other night at the council meeting and I won't go through the story again, but I think what's most important to me, particularly as a mother of a child who's not of the dominant culture, is that this model is designed to help us to listen to each other.

564
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:58,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And I spoke very passionately last Tuesday night at this microphone

565
00:42:59,461 --> 00:43:00,422
[SPEAKER_01]: about the issue.

566
00:43:00,442 --> 00:43:04,047
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a much more heated dialogue then than it is tonight.

567
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:14,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And I received hate mail at the church two days ago, someone calling me a demon and that I had an inappropriate

568
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:20,975
[SPEAKER_01]: agenda, that I had exploited my child.

569
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:41,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I share that with you to say that while we generally feel as though we're doing a really great job, and we are doing a great job, and there's still so much work to be done, we have so far to go as a society to really, really love one another in the way that

570
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,562
[SPEAKER_01]: we have in our souls.

571
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:48,406
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our guts feel that and yet we are blinded by our experience.

572
00:43:48,986 --> 00:43:55,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have, you know, this conversation, making a public statement is just another way.

573
00:43:56,131 --> 00:44:05,798
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat, you know, at the Arabic club after the Hijab Day situation and watched those children cry because their experience was being denied.

574
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:09,501
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing a great job and we have more work to do.

575
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:10,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for your

576
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,812
[SPEAKER_01]: for your time and your attention and your commitment.

577
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:14,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

578
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:19,156
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion for approval by Ms.

579
00:44:19,176 --> 00:44:20,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

580
00:44:20,957 --> 00:44:21,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

581
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:21,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

582
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:25,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Van der Kloot.

583
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:29,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my friend Aaron over there.

584
00:44:29,704 --> 00:44:30,004
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

585
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:51,006
[SPEAKER_09]: AJ as he's known.

586
00:44:53,508 --> 00:44:54,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, absolutely.

587
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:55,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Come forward, please.

588
00:44:56,743 --> 00:44:57,203
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

589
00:44:57,223 --> 00:44:57,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.

590
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:58,304
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?

591
00:44:58,344 --> 00:44:58,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

592
00:44:58,544 --> 00:44:58,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

593
00:44:59,465 --> 00:45:00,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I say my address?

594
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:00,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

595
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:01,486
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

596
00:45:01,526 --> 00:45:02,767
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Aaron J. Olapade.

597
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:03,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I live on 105 Brooke Street.

598
00:45:03,628 --> 00:45:04,569
[SPEAKER_09]: You can stand tall.

599
00:45:04,929 --> 00:45:05,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

600
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:06,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand tall.

601
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:12,334
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally understand what you're saying about like how you think that Medford is like a great place and how we are doing what we're supposed to be doing.

602
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:17,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so because I came from a place where I didn't really think that and I thought that we were very undiverse.

603
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:19,139
[SPEAKER_00]: And so me coming here when I was,

604
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:24,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 13, it was kind of interesting because I was so surprised at how diverse I felt.

605
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:29,327
[SPEAKER_00]: But it isn't a matter of how much we're doing, it's a matter of how much we can do more.

606
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:33,709
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that because we might, let's say we're doing 80%, I think we can do 90%, 100%.

607
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:40,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can do so much more that it will be like a model for other towns.

608
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:46,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, I don't understand exactly what's happening, meaning I don't understand what a resolute is, but I do know

609
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,119
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of get it, but I do know that it is something that's really important to me.

610
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:54,642
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to a lot of kids in my school and it's important to my mom and other adults in the community.

611
00:45:55,103 --> 00:46:01,427
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it might not be, you know, it might not be as important as some people will believe, but I think it's important to a lot of other people.

612
00:46:01,688 --> 00:46:03,889
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much for coming tonight.

613
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:04,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure mom's proud.

614
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:05,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

615
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:05,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

616
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,954
[SPEAKER_09]: We're passing along a signature sheet.

617
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:14,797
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could sign it, it will be posted in city hall and we'll send a copy up to the school department as well.

618
00:46:15,137 --> 00:46:15,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

619
00:46:17,914 --> 00:46:20,997
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to revert to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

620
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:22,258
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

621
00:46:22,939 --> 00:46:23,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

622
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Community participation?

623
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:27,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I see none.

624
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:29,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of superintendent.

625
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:32,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, update report on science program initiatives.

626
00:46:32,608 --> 00:46:33,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

627
00:46:33,448 --> 00:46:38,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, Rocco Sierra is unable to be with us this evening.

628
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:42,677
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not feeling well, but we have a terrific substitute, our deputy superintendent.

629
00:46:44,538 --> 00:46:45,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Just don't ask me any questions.

630
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:54,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, Rocco's home with the flu, and he prepared this report for you earlier last week.

631
00:46:56,122 --> 00:47:09,486
[SPEAKER_13]: As you can see from the report, under the leadership of Rocco Sieri, Director of Science, he's been very proactive in seeking out opportunities for our students to experience real science in a variety of ways.

632
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:18,691
[SPEAKER_13]: And as a result of these efforts, we're pleased to report that this year there are a variety of grants and programs that will benefit the students in all grade levels.

633
00:47:19,832 --> 00:47:28,177
[SPEAKER_13]: The report that you got outlines the different grants and programs that are currently in progress and in also planning stages.

634
00:47:28,998 --> 00:47:36,943
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, you can see we have many connections with universities, with organizations that are there to promote science.

635
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:40,351
[SPEAKER_13]: And as a result, our students and our teachers are benefiting.

636
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:46,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Without reading every project, you can see that a lot of these focus on real life type science activities.

637
00:47:47,853 --> 00:48:02,338
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I think that Mr. Ceri's done a tremendous job seeking out opportunities for our students to enjoy these engaging activities and also for the teachers to obtain professional development as a result of the grants.

638
00:48:02,918 --> 00:48:07,119
[SPEAKER_13]: So some of the projects, again, the elementary level, there's a lot going on.

639
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:13,697
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a grant to support river herring migration, education and outreach.

640
00:48:14,278 --> 00:48:18,039
[SPEAKER_13]: The middle school level, there's more work being done in environmental science.

641
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:24,382
[SPEAKER_13]: And you will note that Mr. Cieri was asked to serve on the advisory board of this project.

642
00:48:25,022 --> 00:48:31,365
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's entitled to an honorarium, which he's going to donate to support the Medford Science facilities.

643
00:48:32,605 --> 00:48:37,327
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the high school level, there are other activities going on through different groups.

644
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, there are a lot of opportunities.

645
00:48:41,549 --> 00:48:45,089
[SPEAKER_13]: And we even have what we call vertical team projects.

646
00:48:45,149 --> 00:48:50,190
[SPEAKER_13]: And that means that teachers across grade levels, science teachers, are collaborating.

647
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,131
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, a lot going on in the world of science.

648
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:59,252
[SPEAKER_13]: He just wanted you to know all of the different activities that it does span the grade levels.

649
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:00,352
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just high school.

650
00:49:00,412 --> 00:49:01,212
[SPEAKER_13]: It is K through 12.

651
00:49:01,912 --> 00:49:04,813
[SPEAKER_13]: And students really enjoy this real life science.

652
00:49:06,207 --> 00:49:08,450
[SPEAKER_13]: hope he gets better soon so we can go back and do some more work.

653
00:49:10,812 --> 00:49:12,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, thank you Beverly.

654
00:49:13,275 --> 00:49:17,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I called Mr. Cieri today and unfortunately he didn't get back to me and now I know why.

655
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:26,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I wanted to let him know that also in addition to that the Medford Educational Foundation just approved our grants and our grant cycle.

656
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:45,473
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them is for materials for Medford's youngest learners in the kindergarten, for owl pellets across the kindergartens, across the city of Medford in every school, which if anybody hasn't done an owl pellet, you take the pellet apart and the kids find the things that the owl has eaten and it's all very exciting.

657
00:49:45,954 --> 00:49:50,837
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've also approved one at the high school level, the remotely operated underwater vehicle.

658
00:49:50,957 --> 00:49:54,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are two things that will be added to the list and we've actually got one more.

659
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,311
[SPEAKER_10]: that we're going to be talking to Mr. Cieri about.

660
00:49:57,531 --> 00:49:58,972
[SPEAKER_10]: So he better get back here quickly, right?

661
00:49:59,152 --> 00:50:00,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, let him recover.

662
00:50:00,652 --> 00:50:01,513
[SPEAKER_09]: No time for illness.

663
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:03,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Scari.

664
00:50:03,574 --> 00:50:09,056
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam Mayor, through you to Mrs. Nelson and Roy, we'll get a kick out of this.

665
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:11,537
[SPEAKER_19]: It was great to see the report on the herring run.

666
00:50:11,557 --> 00:50:23,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Roy and I, in our younger days, April vacations, we would run over to the Army Navy store and get the triple hooks and bring a basket full of herring home for the family garden every year.

667
00:50:23,697 --> 00:50:27,739
[SPEAKER_19]: But unfortunately, it's no longer possible, as they're an endangered species.

668
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:36,222
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's great to see that our kids in the middle schools and high schools are interacting each year when they do the fish count at the Mystic River, at the Mystic Lakes.

669
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:37,343
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's great.

670
00:50:37,403 --> 00:50:44,466
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wish Mr. Cieri and his cohorts and kids best of luck in their counts this spring.

671
00:50:44,526 --> 00:50:47,627
[SPEAKER_19]: And it may be an enjoyable and memorable experience for all of them.

672
00:50:48,168 --> 00:50:50,969
[SPEAKER_19]: And we appreciate all that he has been doing for our science department.

673
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:52,750
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would hope that you would pass that along.

674
00:50:55,411 --> 00:50:55,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

675
00:50:55,711 --> 00:50:56,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Mustone.

676
00:50:58,233 --> 00:50:59,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the report.

677
00:51:00,095 --> 00:51:10,523
[SPEAKER_17]: In October, we met about the MCAS results and Mr. Cieri had talked about having a committee to look into new curriculum for this coming September.

678
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:15,367
[SPEAKER_17]: I was wondering if a committee has been formed or people have been invited about a committee meeting.

679
00:51:15,387 --> 00:51:18,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you know if that's in the plans?

680
00:51:18,569 --> 00:51:21,812
[SPEAKER_17]: I was hoping Mr. Cieri would be here tonight because when we met was October.

681
00:51:23,106 --> 00:51:27,970
[SPEAKER_17]: The goal was to have the first committee meeting in January, and then to have a curriculum picked by September.

682
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:30,953
[SPEAKER_17]: And now it's already December 5th, so I don't know if anyone's been invited.

683
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:36,237
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what is happening first is that we have the new science frameworks.

684
00:51:36,918 --> 00:51:43,283
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really have to establish what, what we do as a district is we look at the frameworks when they come out.

685
00:51:43,703 --> 00:51:48,547
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we look at what we already have in place for curriculum, and then we make adjustments.

686
00:51:49,020 --> 00:52:02,005
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we're still in the process, and maybe Dr. Riccadeli, who, you know, works with Mr. Seary on curriculum, can, I don't know if she has anything else to add, but I believe they're probably still in that process.

687
00:52:02,025 --> 00:52:05,746
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't want to select materials before you really have your curriculum.

688
00:52:06,006 --> 00:52:06,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

689
00:52:06,147 --> 00:52:09,448
[SPEAKER_09]: We could write a request as well tonight if you'd like to get a response from Mr. Seary.

690
00:52:09,468 --> 00:52:09,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that'd be great.

691
00:52:09,848 --> 00:52:11,509
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, because I'm not looking to pick the curriculum.

692
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:17,811
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm looking just to see if people were invited to have a committee meeting to look at curriculums that are options out there on the market for our frameworks.

693
00:52:18,548 --> 00:52:27,390
[SPEAKER_13]: But the problem is that these are brand new and that oftentimes when we jump very quickly into something in terms of material, we make mistakes.

694
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:31,471
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to see what companies will start to come out with more materials.

695
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,171
[SPEAKER_13]: This happened with mathematics.

696
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:34,691
[SPEAKER_13]: It happens with English language arts.

697
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:44,673
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, you need to really give the new curriculum frameworks time to be digested by everyone and then these companies are going to come out.

698
00:52:44,973 --> 00:52:47,614
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't want to buy something that's the first thing on the market.

699
00:52:48,025 --> 00:52:50,728
[SPEAKER_13]: that may not be the best, and we don't want to get burned by that.

700
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:56,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, but I'm looking at, so I got Cullen's Roberts School report card today in his folder for fifth grade.

701
00:52:57,454 --> 00:52:58,875
[SPEAKER_17]: So English, we're pretty decent.

702
00:52:58,895 --> 00:53:00,717
[SPEAKER_17]: We're 5% off from the state average.

703
00:53:00,857 --> 00:53:01,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Math, we're

704
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:04,019
[SPEAKER_17]: 11% off from the state average.

705
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:05,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Science, we're 14%.

706
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,742
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's, I thought I was pretty vocal in that October meeting.

707
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:19,230
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we're not going to jump in and buy a curriculum, but I don't even, I mean the, I just wondering if we are talking to teachers because that right people, I was told that teachers were the ones who go on the committee.

708
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:19,890
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right.

709
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:23,753
[SPEAKER_17]: And so they haven't even been asked to be part of this committee.

710
00:53:23,873 --> 00:53:31,258
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought, and I wish I took better notes that I thought we had decided on a January committee date and now it's December 5th.

711
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,597
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just wondering if the ball got rolling.

712
00:53:34,657 --> 00:53:35,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me check with him when he gets back.

713
00:53:35,938 --> 00:53:36,418
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be great.

714
00:53:36,438 --> 00:53:36,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to you.

715
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:37,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

716
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:37,579
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

717
00:53:41,323 --> 00:53:43,183
[SPEAKER_17]: So do I have to make a motion to make that happen?

718
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to get a report from Mr. Seary.

719
00:53:45,224 --> 00:53:45,444
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

720
00:53:45,864 --> 00:53:46,484
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the motion.

721
00:53:46,804 --> 00:53:49,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Second the motion by Mr. Benedetto.

722
00:53:49,364 --> 00:53:50,024
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

723
00:53:50,265 --> 00:53:51,125
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

724
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,005
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion is granted.

725
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:56,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to receive and place on file the science program initiative?

726
00:53:56,306 --> 00:53:57,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you want to speak on it?

727
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:57,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

728
00:53:57,626 --> 00:53:59,686
[SPEAKER_05]: She wants to speak.

729
00:53:59,706 --> 00:54:00,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just one comment.

730
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:06,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So just want to remind you that on the 14th, you've all been invited to the science museum.

731
00:54:07,267 --> 00:54:11,008
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't got the thing on the, uh, the global scholars program,

732
00:54:11,633 --> 00:54:28,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to intersect with the Bloomberg gift to the Science Museum on science innovation and innovation around the world, how our middle school students are talking to students from around the world on scientific issues like the digital environment, water, and things of that type.

733
00:54:28,656 --> 00:54:31,697
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're invited to participate and to watch.

734
00:54:32,197 --> 00:54:33,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's on the 14th.

735
00:54:33,297 --> 00:54:35,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll reemphasize that to you.

736
00:54:35,198 --> 00:54:39,939
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's another aspect of how science gets integrated into a lot of other activities as well.

737
00:54:40,899 --> 00:54:41,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

738
00:54:43,755 --> 00:54:53,722
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did extend that invitation to you and I know at least one of you, uh, before I left, um, had some questions about parking.

739
00:54:54,022 --> 00:55:02,649
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I hope to have those questions answered for you tomorrow, I do need to get the answers, um, through the museum of science and also our global scholar partner.

740
00:55:03,442 --> 00:55:09,626
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, this program is designed to enhance the grade 7 social studies and science curricula.

741
00:55:11,628 --> 00:55:17,512
[SPEAKER_12]: So we really hope if you're able to attend, you'll be able to participate with us on the 14th, which is next Wednesday.

742
00:55:18,012 --> 00:55:18,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

743
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:22,476
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to receive and place this report on file, offered by Ms.

744
00:55:22,496 --> 00:55:24,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

745
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:25,017
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

746
00:55:25,037 --> 00:55:25,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

747
00:55:25,738 --> 00:55:26,398
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

748
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:27,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion is granted.

749
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Item 2, report on credit recovery.

750
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:32,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Mayor, making a second appearance.

751
00:55:33,565 --> 00:55:34,285
[SPEAKER_13]: And credit recovery.

752
00:55:34,725 --> 00:55:36,226
[SPEAKER_13]: I might come back for a third later.

753
00:55:37,866 --> 00:55:39,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we're kind of excited about this.

754
00:55:40,006 --> 00:55:48,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Credit recovery, as you know, for many years has been needed by our students who want to graduate on time, who want to get promoted to the next grade.

755
00:55:49,008 --> 00:55:50,268
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always been an option.

756
00:55:50,308 --> 00:55:56,409
[SPEAKER_13]: The guidance department's worked very hard with students to find them places to make up lost credit.

757
00:55:56,469 --> 00:55:59,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Now oftentimes, a student can double up on a course.

758
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:04,590
[SPEAKER_13]: If they have the time in their schedule, they can retake a course that they perhaps have failed.

759
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,452
[SPEAKER_13]: But oftentimes, it's not an option.

760
00:56:06,492 --> 00:56:08,154
[SPEAKER_13]: They just have too full a program.

761
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:14,880
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have to have something in place so they can do this credit recovery outside of the regular school schedule.

762
00:56:15,861 --> 00:56:22,808
[SPEAKER_13]: So to date, our students have been referred for credit recovery to outside sources.

763
00:56:22,908 --> 00:56:24,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Many of them go over to Somerville.

764
00:56:25,188 --> 00:56:32,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Somerville had a credit recovery program using an online program, online courses from Edgenuity.

765
00:56:33,555 --> 00:56:38,539
[SPEAKER_13]: And others have been going to online, Brigham Young University.

766
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,963
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, this is all pretty much, they're directed by the guidance department.

767
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:46,726
[SPEAKER_13]: These were the two viable places where they could pick up the credit.

768
00:56:47,627 --> 00:56:48,988
[SPEAKER_13]: There are some problems with that.

769
00:56:49,508 --> 00:56:52,651
[SPEAKER_13]: We know that when they go outside and they take these courses,

770
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:58,513
[SPEAKER_13]: That we're not sure the content of the courses, are they really a match for what we want our students to learn?

771
00:56:59,034 --> 00:57:02,537
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, some of these courses are very costly to students.

772
00:57:03,097 --> 00:57:18,112
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've been working for the past few months, the administration, Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, and Curtis Tufts, along with guidance, to work out a solution to credit recovery that we can have as our own home grown.

773
00:57:18,912 --> 00:57:29,857
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, we feel that having this credit recovery, we'll be able to monitor our students' progress to really take a look and make sure that they are making up what they need to make up for content.

774
00:57:31,038 --> 00:57:35,680
[SPEAKER_13]: We also know that the district, over the past few years, we're promoting online learning.

775
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:46,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Online learning is the wave of the future, and I think we all feel very strongly that every student should have an online course in high school, because in college, that's what they're doing.

776
00:57:46,983 --> 00:57:50,785
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do whole MBA programs and doctoral programs online today.

777
00:57:51,246 --> 00:57:56,889
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really important that students are familiar with these particular online offerings.

778
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:05,674
[SPEAKER_13]: This year at summer school, we piloted online science makeup courses using the product Inventum.

779
00:58:06,114 --> 00:58:07,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, we have looked at ingenuity.

780
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:10,977
[SPEAKER_13]: The curriculum directors look at these products.

781
00:58:11,017 --> 00:58:12,178
[SPEAKER_13]: They look at the courses.

782
00:58:12,778 --> 00:58:13,999
[SPEAKER_13]: They see if they're a match.

783
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:17,768
[SPEAKER_13]: And they felt that ingenuity wasn't a great match.

784
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:22,731
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they went and took a look at Edmentum, which is another online offering.

785
00:58:23,391 --> 00:58:27,033
[SPEAKER_13]: And tweaking that a little bit, they thought that was a better product.

786
00:58:27,073 --> 00:58:33,656
[SPEAKER_13]: So this summer, again, Mr. Cieri looked at the science offerings and he tweaked them a little bit.

787
00:58:33,816 --> 00:58:38,198
[SPEAKER_13]: And our students at summer school took all their science makeup courses online.

788
00:58:38,218 --> 00:58:39,098
[SPEAKER_13]: It worked out very well.

789
00:58:39,878 --> 00:58:40,799
[SPEAKER_13]: There were a lot of benefits.

790
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:43,620
[SPEAKER_13]: So for example, when summer school ends on a certain date,

791
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,784
[SPEAKER_13]: These students, if they weren't quite finished with the course, could continue on until they finish.

792
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:52,647
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are a lot of positives with using the online learning.

793
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:58,893
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we have done over the past few months is we've developed a protocol for credit recovery.

794
00:58:59,253 --> 00:59:04,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we want our students to stay with us as they make their credits up.

795
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:09,863
[SPEAKER_13]: And the terms of what we feel will work are on the next page of the report.

796
00:59:10,712 --> 00:59:14,896
[SPEAKER_13]: We want all credit recovery courses taken through the Medford Public Schools.

797
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:21,542
[SPEAKER_13]: And that no outside district programs will be accepted for credit recovery.

798
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:24,364
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to keep the cost reasonable.

799
00:59:24,404 --> 00:59:31,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we looked at the cost, Somerville charged $125, Brigham Young University I think charged up to 350.

800
00:59:32,171 --> 00:59:34,013
[SPEAKER_13]: So we wanted to keep it at the lower end.

801
00:59:34,513 --> 00:59:36,335
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to, we're thinking 125.

802
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:42,520
[SPEAKER_13]: is fair to everyone, of course, if there's some hardship, we'll consider that.

803
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:53,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Students requesting recovery, there's a form that's been actually, the guidance has used it for several years that they have to get approval, they just can't go on their own.

804
00:59:54,544 --> 00:59:59,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Online courses must have the endorsement of the director of curriculum and instruction.

805
00:59:59,205 --> 01:00:03,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Riccadeli, working with the curriculum directors, looks over all these courses.

806
01:00:04,132 --> 01:00:07,794
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not happy with all of them, so we're going to take some of them off the table for the time being.

807
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:14,259
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that Mrs. Joy feels algebra one and geometry through Edmentum isn't quite what it should be.

808
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:24,885
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will again offer those as credit recovery in another way for students until we can modify what's online to meet our standards.

809
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,867
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're not just putting this product out and saying this is it.

810
01:00:28,288 --> 01:00:31,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Ingenuity in Somerville, they just put it out there and our kids were taking this.

811
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:34,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, it wasn't a great match with the curriculum.

812
01:00:35,962 --> 01:00:39,445
[SPEAKER_13]: The student liaisons, we want the students to be carefully monitored.

813
01:00:39,465 --> 01:00:48,912
[SPEAKER_13]: And by the way, with this product Admentum, it actually, you can see how many times a student goes online and actually engages in the learning.

814
01:00:49,433 --> 01:00:53,976
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have the assistant principals, the guidance people that are monitoring this.

815
01:00:54,457 --> 01:01:01,022
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to set up some professional development for them in January so that they know what the kids are supposed to be doing.

816
01:01:01,702 --> 01:01:02,682
[SPEAKER_13]: And that will take place.

817
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:06,443
[SPEAKER_13]: We're currently making those deadlines, those arrangements.

818
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:15,104
[SPEAKER_13]: And then our Director of Instructional Technology is going to maintain all records related to the use of the online courses.

819
01:01:15,624 --> 01:01:17,745
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a cost to the online courses.

820
01:01:18,085 --> 01:01:23,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now we have a contract where we can have 500 courses for about $5,000.

821
01:01:24,186 --> 01:01:31,087
[SPEAKER_13]: But we will recoup some of that through the tuition, both in summer school as well as the credit recovery.

822
01:01:31,852 --> 01:01:32,812
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's our plan.

823
01:01:32,852 --> 01:01:34,613
[SPEAKER_13]: We feel that we've made a lot of progress.

824
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:36,153
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had a number of meetings on this.

825
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:41,374
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't like the fact our kids were going outside and we had no idea how that was going.

826
01:01:41,474 --> 01:01:44,415
[SPEAKER_13]: They'd just come back and they'd say, this is my credit.

827
01:01:44,975 --> 01:01:46,235
[SPEAKER_13]: We feel this is a better way to go.

828
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:54,837
[SPEAKER_13]: This would be just for juniors and seniors right now, because we really need to work out the algebra one and the geometry, which the underclassmen tend to need.

829
01:01:55,217 --> 01:02:00,598
[SPEAKER_13]: But we will have something up and running for them, probably a hybrid of this online program.

830
01:02:01,363 --> 01:02:03,844
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where we are, and I'd be happy to take any of your questions.

831
01:02:04,644 --> 01:02:06,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a pass, fail grade, or?

832
01:02:06,865 --> 01:02:10,987
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it's a grade, but I believe there's a certain grade they have to attain in order for it to count.

833
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:15,508
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know specifically what that is, but I would guess it'd be maybe a C or a C minus.

834
01:02:15,748 --> 01:02:17,169
[SPEAKER_09]: But you could get an A in the class.

835
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:20,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hm.

836
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:20,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Vanderclute?

837
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:27,373
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Beverly, would these be courses that a student is doing at home or during school time?

838
01:02:27,413 --> 01:02:27,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Could be both.

839
01:02:28,461 --> 01:02:34,284
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the library, we have a lot of kids that go to the library during the school day if they have a study and they could be working on it there.

840
01:02:35,104 --> 01:02:37,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly, you know, a lot of it could be done on their own.

841
01:02:38,106 --> 01:02:42,048
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is the benefit of it, too, is that they can do it outside the regular school hours.

842
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:52,693
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, we can keep track because this particular product does allow the person overseeing this to see if that student's really doing this work.

843
01:02:54,253 --> 01:03:00,219
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can continue, does this particular product allow for a different usage?

844
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:13,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Say a student didn't fail the course but they got a D and now they're a senior and they're realizing that that D is really going to hurt them or that they really need the content of that course.

845
01:03:13,431 --> 01:03:19,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a way to use it as a review or possibly to improve their grade?

846
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:24,438
[SPEAKER_13]: As we go along with this, I think it has a lot of uses.

847
01:03:24,919 --> 01:03:38,610
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things we can do in that particular student's case where they may have some of the content of the course, but maybe have missed certain concepts, we can pull out modules from the course of the reinforcement that they need.

848
01:03:39,872 --> 01:03:43,074
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, this particular product has many, many different courses in it.

849
01:03:43,635 --> 01:03:47,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them are great courses that can be used at middle school, such as study skills.

850
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:49,600
[SPEAKER_13]: So the actual product itself,

851
01:03:50,240 --> 01:04:03,307
[SPEAKER_13]: To answer your question, yes, you could take a student who didn't pass the credit recovery course, and you could give them those portions of it to redo, to retake, to get them up to the level they need to be.

852
01:04:03,847 --> 01:04:05,048
[SPEAKER_13]: It has the capacity to do that.

853
01:04:05,128 --> 01:04:09,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Once we buy the option, we also could use the courses in different ways as well.

854
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:09,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

855
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:13,092
[SPEAKER_13]: We can mark, just like we did with the science this summer.

856
01:04:13,352 --> 01:04:15,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, we hadn't purchased it at this point.

857
01:04:15,353 --> 01:04:16,713
[SPEAKER_13]: They allowed us to pilot it.

858
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:19,675
[SPEAKER_13]: And so Mr. Cieri said, okay, this is a

859
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:27,107
[SPEAKER_13]: good solid course, but the students coming to summer school have missed more of these concepts than others.

860
01:04:27,207 --> 01:04:40,675
[SPEAKER_13]: And so he basically, and of course summer school is abbreviated to a period of time, so he basically pulled out the modules out of the course that he felt were most specific to what these kids needed for remediation.

861
01:04:41,055 --> 01:04:42,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you can modify, you don't, once you

862
01:04:43,481 --> 01:04:46,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Once you purchase the course, it's not that you can't do what you need.

863
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:47,903
[SPEAKER_13]: And how much does it cost to?

864
01:04:48,223 --> 01:04:56,287
[SPEAKER_13]: We purchase, we had a contract of 500 courses, which will take us through September 1st for about $5,000, $5,500.

865
01:04:56,767 --> 01:05:04,230
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other question I have, the only thing that makes me uncomfortable in the protocol you've put forth is the absolute.

866
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:08,512
[SPEAKER_10]: No outside of district programs will be accepted for credit recovery.

867
01:05:08,993 --> 01:05:12,274
[SPEAKER_10]: My preference actually would be no outside of district programs will be accepted.

868
01:05:12,618 --> 01:05:19,323
[SPEAKER_10]: for credit recovery unless approved by the assistant superintendent or something.

869
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:20,003
[SPEAKER_10]: We could do that.

870
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:24,687
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason for that is because I think that you can't foresee everything.

871
01:05:25,207 --> 01:05:27,329
[SPEAKER_10]: And there might be a reason why it makes sense.

872
01:05:27,749 --> 01:05:36,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we're going to adopt this as a policy, my preference is for oversight and for the unexpected.

873
01:05:37,256 --> 01:05:41,799
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would move if it's acceptable.

874
01:05:42,497 --> 01:05:53,887
[SPEAKER_10]: will be accepted for credit recovery unless approved by, and you can decide whether it's the assistant superintendent, the superintendent, the department head, whatever.

875
01:05:53,907 --> 01:05:59,731
[SPEAKER_13]: What we were hoping tonight is just to put the protocol in place and we can add that language to it.

876
01:06:00,092 --> 01:06:07,298
[SPEAKER_13]: And then as we work through it, then we can see if there are any problems and we can ask the committee to vote it in as a policy.

877
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,680
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, we were just talking about getting it going.

878
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:32,468
[SPEAKER_13]: systematic protocol so we can add that to it because the benefit to it you know if you have a student who goes away for the summer and yet needs wants to make a course up you know they couldn't do it here they could online and that's another plus with this so oh I think there's lots and lots of pluses I just want we can ask we'll add that in okay so you want it unless

879
01:06:33,212 --> 01:06:35,952
[SPEAKER_13]: approved by the... You pick, you can decide.

880
01:06:36,253 --> 01:06:39,053
[SPEAKER_13]: The guidance, we'll put it on the guidance.

881
01:06:39,353 --> 01:06:40,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Director of guidance.

882
01:06:40,093 --> 01:06:41,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Director of guidance, that sounds good.

883
01:06:42,894 --> 01:06:45,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to accept the report as amended, offered by Ms.

884
01:06:45,754 --> 01:06:46,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

885
01:06:46,274 --> 01:06:47,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second on the floor?

886
01:06:47,394 --> 01:06:47,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

887
01:06:48,215 --> 01:06:49,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

888
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:50,975
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

889
01:06:50,995 --> 01:06:51,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

890
01:06:51,855 --> 01:06:52,515
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

891
01:06:52,595 --> 01:06:53,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

892
01:06:54,776 --> 01:06:56,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Comment, Mr. Benedetto?

893
01:06:56,756 --> 01:06:58,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really happy to see this, Beverly.

894
01:06:58,516 --> 01:07:02,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that I've talked about this for a long time and having options for children.

895
01:07:04,273 --> 01:07:13,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to look at this for children that might be having some issues that they couldn't feel comfortable attending school and how we can help them.

896
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:31,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So this, I think, is the first step for helping children that are really having a difficult time walking into the building and how we can possibly build on this so that way all our children have the right to still be able to, whether it's a physical or emotional,

897
01:07:32,436 --> 01:07:39,341
[SPEAKER_08]: any type of issue that they can't get to school that we could use more and more of this to make sure that we're addressing those needs.

898
01:07:40,082 --> 01:07:41,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this is a big step towards that.

899
01:07:41,563 --> 01:07:50,069
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also helpful for the student who is really trying during the school day, just can't get there and needs that extra support to get there.

900
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:53,732
[SPEAKER_13]: And so again, it has multiple pluses to it.

901
01:07:54,092 --> 01:07:54,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.

902
01:07:54,813 --> 01:07:55,533
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really happy.

903
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:56,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the work on this.

904
01:07:56,974 --> 01:07:57,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

905
01:07:59,811 --> 01:08:03,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Item 3, report on Michigan model health education program.

906
01:08:15,463 --> 01:08:16,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

907
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:26,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford Public Schools has adopted the nationally recognized Michigan model for health curriculum, which is a comprehensive skills-based health curriculum

908
01:08:26,771 --> 01:08:29,892
[SPEAKER_14]: that is research-based and aligned to national standards.

909
01:08:30,512 --> 01:08:42,857
[SPEAKER_14]: The Michigan Model Health Curriculum is recognized by the Collaborative for Academic and Social and Emotional Learning and the National Registry for Evidence-Based Programs and Practices.

910
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:54,642
[SPEAKER_14]: This comprehensive curriculum has units of instruction focusing on social-emotional health issues and other areas we have identified as high-needs areas for our students.

911
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:06,847
[SPEAKER_14]: So the middle and the high school, as you know by now, have already adopted and implemented the Michigan model, and so we're happy now that the elementary schools are now a part of this.

912
01:09:07,828 --> 01:09:21,497
[SPEAKER_14]: They are covering social-emotional units in grades K-5, and these units include understanding your feelings, problem-solving, decision-making, communication skills, conflict resolution, and anger management.

913
01:09:22,414 --> 01:09:30,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Adoption of the Michigan model at the elementary level provides consistency and articulation of the K-12 health curriculum.

914
01:09:31,059 --> 01:09:39,223
[SPEAKER_14]: And in addition, the Michigan model curriculum for metro public schools also presents the DARE program for our fifth grade students.

915
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:42,545
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that has been in effect for many years.

916
01:09:43,525 --> 01:09:46,967
[SPEAKER_14]: In September, we had a training for our elementary teachers.

917
01:09:47,885 --> 01:09:51,346
[SPEAKER_14]: led by Pat Degon of Michigan Model.

918
01:09:52,246 --> 01:10:00,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Rachel Perry, our supervisor of health, of physical education, I should say, has been on board since the very beginning with Michigan Model.

919
01:10:00,949 --> 01:10:06,270
[SPEAKER_14]: She has been ordering all of our materials and our supplies and overseeing all the pretests.

920
01:10:06,971 --> 01:10:15,013
[SPEAKER_14]: She's created Google Sheets for our elementary staff so that they can fill in their pretest grades and then at the end of the school year,

921
01:10:15,432 --> 01:10:17,053
[SPEAKER_14]: we can look at the post-test grades.

922
01:10:17,854 --> 01:10:35,345
[SPEAKER_14]: So just recently all of our K-5 teachers, well I shouldn't say K-5, it's grades 2-5 teachers submitted their pre-test grades and I'm going to let Rachel talk to you a little bit about the average of the grades and then how they implemented was in effect for the middle and the high school as well.

923
01:10:35,705 --> 01:10:35,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Rachel?

924
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:40,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, members of the school committee.

925
01:10:40,729 --> 01:10:44,371
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to talk a little bit about the history of our health program in the city.

926
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:59,708
[SPEAKER_16]: For years, we had been using second step health curriculum throughout the district, and many teachers and administrators have concluded that second step was developmentally appropriate, but it was not reaching the health issues and concerns of today's adolescents.

927
01:11:00,869 --> 01:11:12,176
[SPEAKER_16]: So therefore, we started to pilot the health curriculum, the Michigan model health curriculum in 2013, and we started that at the high school, then we moved to the middle school, and now finally down at the elementary school.

928
01:11:12,876 --> 01:11:14,457
[SPEAKER_16]: At the high school, we're in our fourth year,

929
01:11:15,068 --> 01:11:16,789
[SPEAKER_16]: In the middle school, it's the third year.

930
01:11:17,129 --> 01:11:20,670
[SPEAKER_16]: In elementary, it's our first year after one year of piloting the program.

931
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:27,472
[SPEAKER_16]: What we've done is we've been assessing at the elementary school.

932
01:11:27,552 --> 01:11:31,153
[SPEAKER_16]: So the pre-test numbers for the grade levels for two to five are listed.

933
01:11:31,753 --> 01:11:33,193
[SPEAKER_16]: For grade two, the average was 78%.

934
01:11:33,253 --> 01:11:33,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Grade three is 79%.

935
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:34,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Grade four, 74%.

936
01:11:34,894 --> 01:11:35,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Grade five, 76%.

937
01:11:43,685 --> 01:11:45,166
[SPEAKER_16]: with the all grade average of 77%.

938
01:11:46,947 --> 01:11:50,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Our hope is that we improve these scores by the end of the school year.

939
01:11:51,169 --> 01:11:54,991
[SPEAKER_16]: What I've done is I have purchased the curriculum for all of the elementary schools.

940
01:11:55,292 --> 01:11:57,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Those were brought out to the elementary schools over the summer.

941
01:11:58,133 --> 01:12:10,660
[SPEAKER_16]: I've also shared all of the PowerPoints, all of the worksheets on a Google Drive so that our teachers can actually go right onto their computers to get all of these things instead of using a disk or going to the curriculum binder.

942
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:13,282
[SPEAKER_16]: So they have options to use either or.

943
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:14,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

944
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:15,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

945
01:12:15,491 --> 01:12:17,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any questions?

946
01:12:19,453 --> 01:12:19,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

947
01:12:19,653 --> 01:12:20,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone.

948
01:12:20,094 --> 01:12:22,976
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll put you on the spot and you might not be the right person to answer this.

949
01:12:24,577 --> 01:12:31,621
[SPEAKER_17]: So as a mother of a sixth and eighth grade girl and reading a lot of Catholic mom blogs, sexting is a concern.

950
01:12:32,202 --> 01:12:38,446
[SPEAKER_17]: And out of curiosity, I went on and I couldn't find a policy on sexting.

951
01:12:39,085 --> 01:12:40,586
[SPEAKER_17]: at the high school or the middle schools.

952
01:12:41,026 --> 01:12:44,488
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know if it's addressed in the Michigan model, if it's a chapter?

953
01:12:45,169 --> 01:12:47,590
[SPEAKER_16]: It is addressed in the high school portion.

954
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:48,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, not middle school?

955
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:49,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Not in middle school, no.

956
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:50,232
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

957
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:54,074
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that something that you hear about at the middle school?

958
01:12:54,094 --> 01:12:57,636
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't heard it firsthand yet, but my daughters just might not be telling me.

959
01:12:58,737 --> 01:13:01,639
[SPEAKER_17]: But is that something, a policy that we should be ahead of it?

960
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:05,421
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I read more and more incidents across the country

961
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:11,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, if it's a policy that we should work on or so, let me try and answer it this way.

962
01:13:11,518 --> 01:13:19,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, a couple of weeks ago we gave you a draft of a reasonable use policy with regard to technology.

963
01:13:20,424 --> 01:13:32,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we pulled it off the table because there was some information that came to us from the ACLU and some other people that we wanted to, uh, review to ensure that we didn't miss anything and that we had a properly looked at legally.

964
01:13:33,432 --> 01:13:33,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

965
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,341
[SPEAKER_05]: We can control how devices are used in the school.

966
01:13:38,141 --> 01:13:46,264
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't control what people do on their own privately as long as it doesn't affect or harass other students or result in bullying.

967
01:13:46,944 --> 01:13:52,686
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly the curriculum can talk about these things and the communication and the hostility.

968
01:13:53,146 --> 01:14:02,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the community conversations issue really speaks to this, about people saying things, whether it's about sex or it's about hate or other forms of inappropriate conversation.

969
01:14:04,308 --> 01:14:14,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It will all come to play through the curriculum, but I think at the same token, a reasonable use policy when we reemerge it, possibly as early as next meeting.

970
01:14:14,931 --> 01:14:16,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure that it's right.

971
01:14:16,311 --> 01:14:22,113
[SPEAKER_05]: We've vetted it with enough legal, and maybe the first of the year if we want to take a little bit more time.

972
01:14:22,913 --> 01:14:30,155
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll speak to the issue of use of devices in schools and suggestions as to what young people should not be doing with their devices.

973
01:14:31,095 --> 01:14:31,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

974
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:37,934
[SPEAKER_17]: I was thinking more if it happens at the middle school or high school, is there a protocol for teachers, right?

975
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:47,100
[SPEAKER_17]: If a teacher here, if a student confides in the teacher and the teacher goes to the school psychologist, like, is there a step-by-step plan?

976
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:52,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there shouldn't be any use of that device for that purpose during the school day in the school setting.

977
01:14:52,604 --> 01:14:53,565
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does happen.

978
01:14:53,765 --> 01:14:57,488
[SPEAKER_05]: But that in of itself would be a violation of the reasonable use policy.

979
01:14:57,968 --> 01:15:01,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be forbidden for use during the day of anything like that.

980
01:15:02,614 --> 01:15:10,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it happens outside, you know, it's kind of hard to police that unless it results in some form of bullying or inappropriate harassment that might exist.

981
01:15:10,796 --> 01:15:11,997
[SPEAKER_17]: This doesn't make me feel better.

982
01:15:12,497 --> 01:15:14,618
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but you have to be real about it.

983
01:15:14,638 --> 01:15:23,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we don't control what people do on the street outside of us except if we are told that it affects how one student interacts with another.

984
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,341
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the education side, we can bring that up through the curriculum.

985
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:29,764
[SPEAKER_09]: but it would affect inside the schools if it's happening.

986
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:30,805
[SPEAKER_05]: If it were happening.

987
01:15:30,845 --> 01:15:31,646
[SPEAKER_05]: If it were happening.

988
01:15:31,806 --> 01:15:32,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

989
01:15:32,186 --> 01:15:33,467
[SPEAKER_05]: If it were happening.

990
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:33,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

991
01:15:33,547 --> 01:15:34,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Van der Kloot.

992
01:15:34,848 --> 01:15:45,576
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that I disagree with you that we don't, I mean we don't have any way to control it, but we certainly have a way or should think about how are we introducing to students

993
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:52,695
[SPEAKER_10]: this issue of sexting and what the long-term and short-term ramifications are.

994
01:15:53,395 --> 01:16:02,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it was in that very article that you gave us last week, that excellent article that you gave us in our last folder, which talked about the uptick.

995
01:16:03,379 --> 01:16:04,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And it isn't

996
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:06,741
[SPEAKER_10]: high school students.

997
01:16:06,981 --> 01:16:09,102
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the, you know, starting at middle school.

998
01:16:09,142 --> 01:16:11,343
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a very important conversation to have.

999
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:22,928
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that I found on the Internet just this past week is whatever is, you know, someone had 1 times 9 equals 7, 2 times 9 equals 18, 3 times 9 equals 27, and it went on.

1000
01:16:23,648 --> 01:16:27,050
[SPEAKER_10]: And then said, and the teacher put it on a blackboard.

1001
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:31,832
[SPEAKER_10]: And right away the kids started going, the teacher, you made a mistake, you made a mistake.

1002
01:16:32,172 --> 01:16:33,813
[SPEAKER_10]: And even though all the other ones were right,

1003
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:37,290
[SPEAKER_10]: The only one that they talked about was the wrong one.

1004
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:41,755
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you do something wrong, I mean, it was such an easy how that can follow you.

1005
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:43,216
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the thing that people see.

1006
01:16:43,636 --> 01:16:49,462
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought it was such a concrete example that should be presented to kids about saying, you know, this is the problem.

1007
01:16:49,482 --> 01:16:54,487
[SPEAKER_10]: If you make that mistake and all of a sudden you write something out or you send a picture to somebody.

1008
01:16:54,897 --> 01:16:55,717
[SPEAKER_10]: it's going to follow you.

1009
01:16:56,657 --> 01:17:07,799
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I don't think it's just, I think the policy that you presented to us, which we will need to follow up, is a piece of the puzzle, but it's not the entire puzzle.

1010
01:17:07,839 --> 01:17:22,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that what Mia is talking about, if I may, Mia, if I think, is sort of saying is how are we making sure that within the scope of our conversations as we seek to educate our kids about social and emotional issues, that sexting becomes part of the topic.

1011
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:23,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1012
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:35,550
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think it's specifically covered as sexting, but we do have character development and choosing who I am, which does go through communication skills in dealing with issues and problem solving and things like that.

1013
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:42,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can, you know, introduce the term sexting, you know, because that would be a common application of communication issues.

1014
01:17:43,652 --> 01:17:45,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's a problem of doing that.

1015
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:49,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think the education side is one side and the technical side is the other side.

1016
01:17:49,334 --> 01:17:50,794
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it comes together.

1017
01:17:51,135 --> 01:17:52,575
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like we're ignoring one or the other.

1018
01:17:56,353 --> 01:17:57,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

1019
01:17:57,454 --> 01:18:06,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So from what I'm hearing is that we have a program that addresses an issue at the high school, but we're seeing that issue at our middle school.

1020
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:19,231
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's take the curriculum that we're using at the high school, check it to make sure it's developmentally appropriate for our middle schoolers, since we're hearing that middle schoolers are engaging in this, and bring that down to them.

1021
01:18:21,984 --> 01:18:23,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we just need to be clear.

1022
01:18:24,485 --> 01:18:27,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not hear that this is happening in the Medford Public Schools.

1023
01:18:28,326 --> 01:18:31,507
[SPEAKER_10]: We are hearing that there is a concern about it.

1024
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:40,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hearing that middle school students are discussing this issue, so the fact that they're talking about it

1025
01:18:41,247 --> 01:18:49,634
[SPEAKER_08]: means that we should talk about it with them and discuss it in an open, caring manner so that they can talk about their concerns.

1026
01:18:49,714 --> 01:18:56,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if it never happened to them, if they're talking about that this is going on, we need to have that conversation before it happens.

1027
01:18:57,601 --> 01:19:00,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And not wait until high school for this particular piece.

1028
01:19:00,964 --> 01:19:05,248
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're being informed by a parent that this topic is in need.

1029
01:19:05,712 --> 01:19:25,422
[SPEAKER_08]: at an earlier time, so I would like for, through you, Mr. Belson, to make a decision to bring this topic, if it's provided at the high school, to have our people, Diane or whomever, needs to look at it and make sure it's appropriate to start bringing that content down into our middle schools.

1030
01:19:25,942 --> 01:19:31,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Because children are starting these more mature conversations much earlier.

1031
01:19:31,644 --> 01:19:45,348
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we're not addressing them until after they've already heard about it, talked about it with other children, we're not helping them learn open communication and how to deal with it and all of the things we need to.

1032
01:19:45,688 --> 01:19:49,649
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to miss the boat and talk to them about things that they've already dealt with.

1033
01:19:50,259 --> 01:19:51,160
[SPEAKER_08]: two, three years now.

1034
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,441
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to get them when they need it.

1035
01:19:52,681 --> 01:19:53,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like D.A.R.E.

1036
01:19:53,382 --> 01:19:57,205
[SPEAKER_08]: is at fifth grade level because that's the appropriate time to speak with them.

1037
01:19:57,546 --> 01:20:06,854
[SPEAKER_08]: And it might have been seventh grade level at some point and moved down because children are more mature in some topics now.

1038
01:20:07,395 --> 01:20:14,221
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we can be proactive and take a look at those lessons that are at the high school and maybe adapt them to bring them down to the middle schools.

1039
01:20:15,684 --> 01:20:22,609
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe at our next policy meeting that we discuss a policy procedure for this.

1040
01:20:23,249 --> 01:20:27,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know exactly when we're having any policy reviews.

1041
01:20:27,952 --> 01:20:31,594
[SPEAKER_05]: But Rachel, I think the assumption here is that there was nothing going on at the middle school in health.

1042
01:20:31,654 --> 01:20:40,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe you should talk a little bit what we are doing in the middle school because I think there's somehow that you see an elementary piece and a high school piece, but we haven't talked about the middle school piece.

1043
01:20:40,815 --> 01:20:41,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1044
01:20:41,355 --> 01:20:50,538
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the sixth grade level, the units that we're teaching are alcohol, drugs and tobacco, nutrition and physical activity, safety and social emotional learning unit.

1045
01:20:51,218 --> 01:20:56,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Seventh grade is tobacco free, healthy eating and physical activity and safety.

1046
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:03,082
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the eighth grade, it's drug free, healthy eating and physical activity and choosing who I am, which is a character development unit.

1047
01:21:03,966 --> 01:21:07,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the things that we've got to understand is a common thread that runs through everything.

1048
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:19,676
[SPEAKER_05]: How do young people make good decisions about anything, whether it's alcohol, sex, behavior towards others, race, things of that type.

1049
01:21:20,056 --> 01:21:25,379
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole constant of all these curricula deals with the issue of good decision making.

1050
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:31,303
[SPEAKER_05]: How you are responsible to yourself and others as you move through, regardless of the content.

1051
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,803
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's really the common thread.

1052
01:21:33,843 --> 01:21:40,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we just simply have to weave in some additional content is really what you're asking.

1053
01:21:40,893 --> 01:21:46,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So that we can give people at least an introduction to that since it seems to be a concern that may be emergent.

1054
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:59,186
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that when Rachel has her own meetings with her staff, she can discuss the issues that have been brought up to talk to her staff about what have you've heard in your classes and maybe it'll come up then as well.

1055
01:22:01,367 --> 01:22:01,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1056
01:22:03,348 --> 01:22:04,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't quite, I wasn't quite done.

1057
01:22:05,169 --> 01:22:13,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so at this point I'd like to, um, make a motion that we discuss putting a protocol in place for, um,

1058
01:22:14,789 --> 01:22:24,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Situations that happen outside of school that teachers hear about what they should do if this information were to come to them, like some school-wide policy.

1059
01:22:25,535 --> 01:22:37,042
[SPEAKER_08]: If I was a teacher of a sixth grader and someone said, this student over here's picture has been put over everybody's cell phone, and I learned of that.

1060
01:22:38,308 --> 01:22:52,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I would know, because there would be a policy in place, that I need to report it to the guidance office as well as the assistant principal, and the assistant principal would then, you know, follow up or whatever that policy would be that we think is necessary.

1061
01:22:52,478 --> 01:22:55,461
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like the superintendent to put something together.

1062
01:22:55,641 --> 01:23:02,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm making a motion that he comes up with a policy and procedures for situations like this.

1063
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:03,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a second.

1064
01:23:05,454 --> 01:23:21,687
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion that the superintendent prepare a draft policy pertaining to things that may happen outside of the school in the classroom that he or she catches wind of and report back to the school committee, seconded by Ms.

1065
01:23:21,727 --> 01:23:22,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Mostone.

1066
01:23:22,268 --> 01:23:22,968
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1067
01:23:22,988 --> 01:23:23,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1068
01:23:23,789 --> 01:23:24,429
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1069
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:25,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1070
01:23:25,931 --> 01:23:26,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1071
01:23:27,763 --> 01:23:28,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Mr. Perry.

1072
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:30,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to accept the report.

1073
01:23:30,768 --> 01:23:34,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

1074
01:23:34,495 --> 01:23:34,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone.

1075
01:23:34,935 --> 01:23:35,616
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1076
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:37,459
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1077
01:23:38,161 --> 01:23:38,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1078
01:23:39,563 --> 01:23:40,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion accepted.

1079
01:23:43,205 --> 01:23:46,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Item number four, a report on professional development schedule.

1080
01:23:47,447 --> 01:23:52,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Deputy superintendent will comment on that if you need additional information.

1081
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:54,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want the date announced at least?

1082
01:23:54,651 --> 01:23:58,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we announce the date because I think it's important that parents know so they can plan.

1083
01:23:58,853 --> 01:24:00,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Monday, March 13th, 2017.

1084
01:24:00,334 --> 01:24:04,176
[SPEAKER_09]: This is currently not on the school calendar, correct?

1085
01:24:04,376 --> 01:24:09,378
[SPEAKER_13]: We will bring it to you first and then we'll, tomorrow actually is our administrative meeting.

1086
01:24:09,418 --> 01:24:10,919
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll announce it to the administrators.

1087
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:13,643
[SPEAKER_13]: So they can inform parents in multiple ways.

1088
01:24:13,703 --> 01:24:16,525
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll adjust the school calendar on the website as well.

1089
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:18,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're just waiting for this evening first.

1090
01:24:18,967 --> 01:24:19,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1091
01:24:19,568 --> 01:24:20,128
[SPEAKER_10]: One question.

1092
01:24:20,769 --> 01:24:22,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I was surprised that you picked a Monday.

1093
01:24:23,431 --> 01:24:24,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Superintendent picked the Monday.

1094
01:24:25,052 --> 01:24:25,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you why.

1095
01:24:26,714 --> 01:24:27,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Why did you pick it?

1096
01:24:27,895 --> 01:24:32,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked a Monday because I want the continuity of the week.

1097
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:34,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to have it on the Wednesday.

1098
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:38,664
[SPEAKER_05]: You come to school for two days and then you have day off and then you go another two days.

1099
01:24:38,704 --> 01:24:39,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it breaks up the week.

1100
01:24:40,343 --> 01:24:41,824
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incumbent upon the faculty.

1101
01:24:41,864 --> 01:24:45,807
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incumbent upon students not to use this as an excuse to extend the weekend.

1102
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:47,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to make that clear to them.

1103
01:24:48,028 --> 01:24:57,694
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's important that we not lose four days consecutively, and just simply have two days, break it up in the middle of the week, and then it really doesn't help us in terms of keeping momentum going in classes.

1104
01:24:58,415 --> 01:24:58,715
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1105
01:24:59,415 --> 01:24:59,575
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1106
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:00,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1107
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:04,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place on file, offered by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

1108
01:25:04,278 --> 01:25:04,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Vandekloot.

1109
01:25:04,839 --> 01:25:05,599
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1110
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:06,840
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1111
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:07,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1112
01:25:08,508 --> 01:25:13,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on proposed change to educator evaluation regulations, Mr. Superintendent.

1113
01:25:13,812 --> 01:25:18,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, there's a lot going on in the evaluation process at the state level.

1114
01:25:19,597 --> 01:25:26,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going back and forth between the Teachers Association, the MASC, the MASS, the Commissioner's Office and the like.

1115
01:25:26,943 --> 01:25:31,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to keep you informed because it's a hot topic right now and I want you to understand, you know,

1116
01:25:32,251 --> 01:25:32,992
[SPEAKER_05]: where it's going.

1117
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:38,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there was a proposed change that the commissioner brought to the attention of the destiny board.

1118
01:25:39,296 --> 01:25:56,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, this past week, uh, commissioner Chester introduced a change that because of the feedback he was getting from the field, no one was really happy with the way there was, it was set up previously that would there be a student impact rating that was independent of the, um,

1119
01:25:57,895 --> 01:25:58,915
[SPEAKER_05]: with a regular rating.

1120
01:25:59,516 --> 01:26:03,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So we came up with an approach that would embed it in standard two.

1121
01:26:03,298 --> 01:26:07,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so it would be part of the standard two rating.

1122
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:12,602
[SPEAKER_05]: The teacher's association, as you can see from what's been attached, is adamantly opposed to it.

1123
01:26:13,362 --> 01:26:16,504
[SPEAKER_05]: The MASS and the MASC believe it's workable.

1124
01:26:17,264 --> 01:26:19,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the board has sent it out for public comment.

1125
01:26:20,392 --> 01:26:25,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the next couple of months, there'll be public comment, and we'll see what actually takes place.

1126
01:26:25,815 --> 01:26:32,238
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's an important element of public policy, because obviously, there's got to be some form of teacher evaluation going on.

1127
01:26:32,398 --> 01:26:39,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And the question is, is that is student learning a legitimate element of determining how effective a teacher is in the classroom?

1128
01:26:39,942 --> 01:26:42,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it shouldn't be so plastic that

1129
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:54,304
[SPEAKER_05]: The teacher who works with the most challenged of students is expected to have the same results as the teachers working with the gifted and talented student who self-motivates and teaches themselves in some ways.

1130
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:58,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Albeit, good teachers inspire anybody at any level.

1131
01:26:59,627 --> 01:27:02,409
[SPEAKER_05]: But having said that, the debate is very sharp right now.

1132
01:27:03,089 --> 01:27:06,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And it reflects a great deal of back and forth.

1133
01:27:07,212 --> 01:27:10,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure exactly how it's going to end up.

1134
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:21,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell you that it is tying us up in terms of dealing with the Teachers Association, in terms of coming up with new ideas as to how to properly evaluate.

1135
01:27:21,887 --> 01:27:32,575
[SPEAKER_05]: It does create a back and forth between the associations in the Commonwealth, and it clearly is a topic that we're going to hear more and more about.

1136
01:27:33,076 --> 01:27:47,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to keep you informed, I want you to know what people are saying, what happened at the board, what happened with the memo you have from the Teachers Association, both from the MTA and the AFT, although it's on the MTA stationery, as to what their objections are.

1137
01:27:48,001 --> 01:27:58,365
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll continue to talk about this because the way we evaluate teachers, the way we set goals for performance is very important to us, and how we measure that

1138
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:04,093
[SPEAKER_05]: is also very important and it will affect personnel decisions going forward.

1139
01:28:04,513 --> 01:28:08,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So, happy to take any questions you may have, but I think the rest of it is self-explanatory.

1140
01:28:09,656 --> 01:28:10,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1141
01:28:10,796 --> 01:28:12,737
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion for approval by Mr. Benedetto.

1142
01:28:12,837 --> 01:28:14,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second on the floor by Ms.

1143
01:28:14,698 --> 01:28:15,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot?

1144
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:15,979
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1145
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:16,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1146
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:17,660
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1147
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,460
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

1148
01:28:20,541 --> 01:28:22,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on school nutrition equipment grant.

1149
01:28:23,023 --> 01:28:23,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

1150
01:28:23,863 --> 01:28:27,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration, Christine

1151
01:28:28,738 --> 01:28:38,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Patterson is doing a great job and stepping in so quickly and Good evening madam mayor members of the committee.

1152
01:28:39,246 --> 01:28:56,258
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to report under our food service program Jewel Bradley and Rhetta Smith that we have received two large pieces of equipment for the McGlynn middle and the Columbus elementary these units are considered heat and hold electric convection ovens, which will

1153
01:28:56,847 --> 01:29:04,753
[SPEAKER_15]: allow those schools to offer the hot meals more quickly, get children through the lines much more expeditiously.

1154
01:29:04,833 --> 01:29:14,080
[SPEAKER_15]: So we continue to look at all of our resources and try to maximize what we can and get additional funding for equipment and services.

1155
01:29:14,961 --> 01:29:18,063
[SPEAKER_15]: For me personally, food services is very important.

1156
01:29:18,123 --> 01:29:24,108
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a member of the School Nutrition Association, so I'm working very closely with Juul to continue

1157
01:29:24,566 --> 01:29:30,651
[SPEAKER_15]: to find additional resources and extend our breakfast programs, free and reduced, wherever we can.

1158
01:29:31,352 --> 01:29:31,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

1159
01:29:32,012 --> 01:29:32,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1160
01:29:32,773 --> 01:29:33,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

1161
01:29:34,314 --> 01:29:38,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1162
01:29:39,858 --> 01:29:40,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

1163
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:44,102
[SPEAKER_17]: Mustone, were those the only two pieces of equipment that they applied for on the grant?

1164
01:29:44,602 --> 01:29:51,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, based on the criteria that was established, you had to be over 50% free and reduced.

1165
01:29:52,246 --> 01:29:53,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1166
01:29:55,407 --> 01:30:00,069
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion to, if we can amend the paper, to make it a motion to accept the grant.

1167
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:17,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto, through you to the superintendent, I know a few years ago we went up on our school lunch prices because we needed to upgrade equipment and make sure that we were adequately, I just really would

1168
01:30:17,716 --> 01:30:23,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I would ask you to look at that and to see if we're going to raise prices again.

1169
01:30:23,898 --> 01:30:33,001
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to give parents in the community enough information early rather than have a vote of a big lump sum because it is a hardship for some families.

1170
01:30:33,081 --> 01:30:40,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't want our children to show up at any level, high school or young, without enough money for school lunches.

1171
01:30:42,752 --> 01:30:53,496
[SPEAKER_08]: really communicate well about this and come forthright rather than at the last minute, the end of the school year for the beginning of next year and parents don't hear it.

1172
01:30:54,136 --> 01:31:09,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, one of the things, I'll just say this as a commentary on what's going on, we don't know what the federal policy is going to be going into next year with regard to USDA reimbursements to the state and to us.

1173
01:31:10,193 --> 01:31:15,195
[SPEAKER_05]: The supply of commodities and things of that type, it could change at this particular point in time.

1174
01:31:15,235 --> 01:31:17,116
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some uncertainty on that level.

1175
01:31:18,076 --> 01:31:26,220
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to deal also with the fact that, you know, the price of food in local markets, we have, you know, some issues with regard to that.

1176
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:28,360
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go up farm to school and things like that.

1177
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,341
[SPEAKER_05]: We want farm fresh.

1178
01:31:29,721 --> 01:31:31,042
[SPEAKER_05]: We want certain kinds of food.

1179
01:31:31,482 --> 01:31:32,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to be careful about that.

1180
01:31:32,622 --> 01:31:34,723
[SPEAKER_05]: But so far the food service program is doing fine.

1181
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:36,444
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we'll monitor that.

1182
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:39,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And our goal would be not to raise prices unless we absolutely have to.

1183
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:42,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And we try to give you as much advance notice as we can.

1184
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:43,331
[SPEAKER_05]: But I appreciate what you're saying.

1185
01:31:43,491 --> 01:31:50,314
[SPEAKER_08]: So in history, what they do is they make due for a very long time, and then they come to us and they need a big increase.

1186
01:31:50,494 --> 01:32:07,360
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think when we spoke to them last time that happened, we told them to come forward ahead of time for maintenance and for new machinery as we go, rather than to wait for a last minute and have a huge price increase to our parents and our students, because some of our students who work

1187
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:09,331
[SPEAKER_08]: and pay for their own lunches.

1188
01:32:09,511 --> 01:32:12,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that they're hungry sometimes.

1189
01:32:12,213 --> 01:32:14,754
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of our students can come to school hungry.

1190
01:32:14,834 --> 01:32:16,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people, that's the only meals they get.

1191
01:32:17,336 --> 01:32:22,039
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want you to be very conscious of it.

1192
01:32:22,459 --> 01:32:22,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1193
01:32:22,859 --> 01:32:23,279
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be.

1194
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:29,563
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will point out to you that more and more of our students are becoming eligible for free and reduced.

1195
01:32:29,583 --> 01:32:32,205
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two schools that received equipment.

1196
01:32:32,225 --> 01:32:37,488
[SPEAKER_05]: They had to have at least 50% of the student body eligible in order to even apply for the grant.

1197
01:32:38,489 --> 01:32:39,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And the others aren't too far behind.

1198
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:44,114
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only one school that's really kind of, you know, doesn't have that economic.

1199
01:32:44,474 --> 01:32:46,976
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of the others are starting to head towards that 50% threshold.

1200
01:32:48,335 --> 01:32:52,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It's simply the nature of the demographic in the community, so we are conscious of that very much.

1201
01:32:52,556 --> 01:32:53,616
[SPEAKER_08]: And what about our high school?

1202
01:32:53,636 --> 01:32:56,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we getting those forms back from our high school students so that they qualify?

1203
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:57,858
[SPEAKER_05]: To the extent that they want to.

1204
01:32:57,878 --> 01:32:59,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Some kids will never tell you because they don't want to.

1205
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:05,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Some families won't, but more and more we're paying attention to that because obviously it affects us.

1206
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:10,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of the reason that prices had to be raised, just so we can remind ourselves of this,

1207
01:33:10,601 --> 01:33:16,087
[SPEAKER_05]: was the fact that the USDA insisted that we charge at least as much as they were reimbursing.

1208
01:33:16,988 --> 01:33:19,951
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't going to reimburse us more money than we were charging ourselves.

1209
01:33:20,892 --> 01:33:24,576
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was an important thing to bring it up, so we had to actually bring it up.

1210
01:33:24,596 --> 01:33:29,221
[SPEAKER_05]: But the point's well taken, and we'll follow up, and we'll try to do the best we can in giving a word out there.

1211
01:33:29,641 --> 01:33:31,043
[SPEAKER_08]: A motion to accept the grant?

1212
01:33:31,063 --> 01:33:31,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

1213
01:33:33,965 --> 01:33:35,506
[SPEAKER_09]: to accept the grant by Ms.

1214
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:36,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

1215
01:33:36,127 --> 01:33:36,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Christine.

1216
01:33:36,827 --> 01:33:46,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to follow up from Superintendent Belson to also indicate that the process has changed for the free and reduced.

1217
01:33:46,193 --> 01:33:50,235
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're not simply reliant on applications at this point any longer.

1218
01:33:50,575 --> 01:34:02,543
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are trying to look at further information informing parents and families of services outside of just school nutrition that if they are able to take advantage of those such as Medicare, SNAP,

1219
01:34:03,047 --> 01:34:09,430
[SPEAKER_15]: other services, that they've become eligible by virtue and we are able to capture them through the portal.

1220
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:11,110
[SPEAKER_15]: So it remains anonymous.

1221
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:16,072
[SPEAKER_15]: There's not this stigma that used to be associated with this process.

1222
01:34:16,492 --> 01:34:22,935
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are being much more active in trying to capture those, as many as we can at all grade levels.

1223
01:34:23,455 --> 01:34:28,297
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, excuse me, I hope you don't mind my comment, parents don't sometimes

1224
01:34:29,104 --> 01:34:39,550
[SPEAKER_08]: realize that when you qualify for free and reduced lunch, you also get discounted amounts on college applications and SAT exams.

1225
01:34:39,911 --> 01:34:42,772
[SPEAKER_08]: So it really is more than just the food program.

1226
01:34:43,152 --> 01:34:47,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think that that's communicated well to most parents in the community.

1227
01:34:48,175 --> 01:34:54,099
[SPEAKER_08]: So even if they say, well, my kid's never going to get a school lunch and they're going to bring their lunch, there's no reason for me to fill out that form.

1228
01:34:54,659 --> 01:34:55,980
[SPEAKER_08]: There are children that, you know,

1229
01:34:56,359 --> 01:35:04,683
[SPEAKER_08]: they get vouchers for SATs, and they get decreased applications for colleges, and they're getting very expensive now.

1230
01:35:05,183 --> 01:35:11,827
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, there's a lot of good reasons to get that out, so I hope that our high school is communicating that piece.

1231
01:35:11,887 --> 01:35:24,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I've spoke to that point before, that maybe Dr. Perella, when he sends out the form, also advises parents that they qualify for those other things, as well as just lunches, and that,

1232
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:27,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a lot of people just have no idea.

1233
01:35:27,632 --> 01:35:28,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1234
01:35:28,773 --> 01:35:29,374
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1235
01:35:29,774 --> 01:35:30,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1236
01:35:30,595 --> 01:35:32,217
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, roll call vote, please.

1237
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:35,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1238
01:35:41,726 --> 01:35:42,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1239
01:35:42,086 --> 01:35:44,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

1240
01:35:44,509 --> 01:35:45,349
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

1241
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:47,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Negotiations and legal matters, are there any?

1242
01:35:48,252 --> 01:35:48,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, there are none.

1243
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:57,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Old business recommendation to send letter to state delegation on enhanced regulation for implementation of new recreational marijuana law.

1244
01:35:57,792 --> 01:35:58,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

1245
01:35:58,913 --> 01:36:03,354
[SPEAKER_05]: So in our last meeting, you asked me to draft a letter from you to our legislative delegation.

1246
01:36:03,955 --> 01:36:04,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I have done so.

1247
01:36:04,915 --> 01:36:08,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And you, you know, had a chance to hopefully to look it over so that we can send it in.

1248
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:12,277
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to bring you up to date on a couple more things that have since emerged.

1249
01:36:12,297 --> 01:36:14,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but that law I did attach.

1250
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:25,842
[SPEAKER_05]: an advisory from the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, legal counsel, which went into a great deal of depth about some of the legal challenges in implementing this law.

1251
01:36:26,323 --> 01:36:39,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I also had the opportunity today to meet with the state treasurer as part of the Economic Empowerment Task Force, which I serve, about the implementation, because the implementation comes under her jurisdiction, at least at this point in time.

1252
01:36:40,686 --> 01:36:41,826
[SPEAKER_05]: As you may know, there's no money

1253
01:36:42,452 --> 01:36:46,476
[SPEAKER_05]: that's been allocated in the current budget for it and the current collections have gone down this month.

1254
01:36:46,536 --> 01:36:56,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's hard to know where that new money is coming and there's no consensus to borrow from the rainy day fund from either the governor or the speaker of the house or the state treasurer.

1255
01:36:56,585 --> 01:36:59,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's unlikely that this will be off and running very soon.

1256
01:37:00,629 --> 01:37:06,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, because they, they need money to set up the apparatus to do the, the kinds of things that are necessary.

1257
01:37:07,001 --> 01:37:08,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, we should be on record.

1258
01:37:08,663 --> 01:37:15,949
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition, we should also note that there are some interesting federal laws that are going to intersect with this right now.

1259
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:19,232
[SPEAKER_05]: There is the Drug-Free Schools Act.

1260
01:37:19,613 --> 01:37:21,054
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the Communities Act.

1261
01:37:21,955 --> 01:37:27,420
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also, you know, a discussion of states' rights versus federal supremacy clause.

1262
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Under the federal supremacy clause,

1263
01:37:30,522 --> 01:37:41,871
[SPEAKER_05]: federal laws take precedent over state laws, unless they're covered by the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which reserves rights to the state that are not enumerated for the federal government.

1264
01:37:42,492 --> 01:37:48,536
[SPEAKER_05]: But depending on the court, it really depends on what the judges want to rule at any one time, because it's gone both ways.

1265
01:37:49,417 --> 01:37:59,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's entirely possible that the incoming Attorney General, who has been very strong in his advocacy against marijuana, recreational or medical, in his home state,

1266
01:38:00,191 --> 01:38:07,675
[SPEAKER_05]: and in the Senate may actually take a more aggressive stance than the current Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch.

1267
01:38:08,276 --> 01:38:16,540
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot going on as to how this stuff is going to play out in the national and the local scene in the upcoming months.

1268
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:27,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing, too, that maybe people don't fully realize is that because it's a federal crime, money's collected for this revenue from marijuana

1269
01:38:27,603 --> 01:38:30,745
[SPEAKER_05]: can't be deposited in a federal bank because it's a criminal act.

1270
01:38:31,385 --> 01:38:36,789
[SPEAKER_09]: They are allowing it now, but with multiple levels of reporting.

1271
01:38:36,809 --> 01:38:48,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, all kinds of, but you know, there's going to be, it's going to be very interesting to see how they play with that because with a new, if you will, sheriff in town at the White House, it could very well be a very difficult thing that goes forward.

1272
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:56,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the interim, it doesn't hurt for us to be on record with the letter that I've drafted for you or any amendments you want to make to it.

1273
01:38:57,123 --> 01:39:03,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but I think that it's going to be a little while before we start to see this, uh, take place and where it goes.

1274
01:39:04,889 --> 01:39:05,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1275
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:11,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, actually it's to adopt the letter last week we asked for a draft.

1276
01:39:11,854 --> 01:39:14,856
[SPEAKER_09]: So is there a motion to accept this letter and submit it on our behalf?

1277
01:39:15,557 --> 01:39:18,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry.

1278
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:18,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Ms.

1279
01:39:18,759 --> 01:39:19,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

1280
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:20,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call, please.

1281
01:39:22,442 --> 01:39:22,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1282
01:39:26,990 --> 01:39:27,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1283
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:30,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative one absent the motion passes.

1284
01:39:30,912 --> 01:39:33,374
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you could send that letter in on our behalf, we appreciate it.

1285
01:39:33,394 --> 01:39:36,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent, just a couple of items.

1286
01:39:36,856 --> 01:39:46,202
[SPEAKER_05]: The superintendent would like to mention just a couple of quick, quick things, you know, again, tomorrow at 1230 is groundbreaking at the community access channel.

1287
01:39:46,262 --> 01:39:52,446
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be hosted in part by the mayor, by Lisa Hughes from channel four of Courtney Cox from Nesson.

1288
01:39:53,088 --> 01:39:57,810
[SPEAKER_05]: and a number of other people from the media coming to see us in action.

1289
01:39:58,351 --> 01:40:01,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll be a good opportunity to see how this thing is progressing.

1290
01:40:01,632 --> 01:40:02,953
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of good work is going on.

1291
01:40:03,013 --> 01:40:12,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Christina has been working real hard with city officials to ensure that the construction goes forward and that the necessary modifications are made so that things go forward.

1292
01:40:13,038 --> 01:40:20,502
[SPEAKER_05]: But tomorrow's an opportunity to see things from the actual site and to get some reports at that opportunity.

1293
01:40:21,362 --> 01:40:22,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I've given you two articles.

1294
01:40:22,961 --> 01:40:27,844
[SPEAKER_05]: from Time Magazine, which was referenced by Paulette a short time ago.

1295
01:40:28,224 --> 01:40:39,912
[SPEAKER_05]: They're worth reading because I think what's important is that we stay up on what's being said out there so we can have the dialogues necessary to guide the future directions of our resources and our curriculum.

1296
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:45,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be noted that the President-Elect has named an incoming U.S.

1297
01:40:45,555 --> 01:40:49,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Secretary of Education, Elizabeth Betsy DeVos of Michigan.

1298
01:40:49,838 --> 01:40:52,700
[SPEAKER_05]: She's an active supporter of school choice, charters, and vouchers.

1299
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:56,641
[SPEAKER_05]: She also has announced that she's against the Common Core.

1300
01:40:57,261 --> 01:40:59,221
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see where that happens, what that means.

1301
01:40:59,381 --> 01:41:02,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, back to the Supremacy Clause versus states' rights.

1302
01:41:03,022 --> 01:41:05,082
[SPEAKER_05]: All those kinds of things have to be worked out.

1303
01:41:06,202 --> 01:41:21,105
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's going to be very interesting to see, especially coming off the most recent initiative petition in the Commonwealth as to what kinds of incentives will be made to the communities, the states, to expand choice.

1304
01:41:21,937 --> 01:41:22,357
[SPEAKER_05]: and the like.

1305
01:41:22,397 --> 01:41:25,558
[SPEAKER_05]: The Massachusetts Constitution forbids certain types of activities.

1306
01:41:26,378 --> 01:41:30,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you know, it's hard to know how it will all intersect, but it bears watching.

1307
01:41:31,539 --> 01:41:36,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are just a few items to bring to your attention, and hopefully you can participate.

1308
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:44,282
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, on the 14th, if you intend to go, let us know so we can arrange for parking and the other things for you at the Science Museum.

1309
01:41:45,222 --> 01:41:45,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1310
01:41:45,722 --> 01:41:47,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

1311
01:41:47,442 --> 01:41:48,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn.

1312
01:41:48,823 --> 01:41:49,663
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1313
01:41:50,782 --> 01:41:51,583
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1314
01:41:52,525 --> 01:41:53,726
Adjourned.

1315
01:41:53,786 --> 01:41:54,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
