    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=0.537s">the</a>  state legislation that would have to be adopted by the city, the school committee, in order to move this into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=9.504s">And</a>  if I could read the state chapter, general law chapter 71, section 55D, small a, upon the issuance of a musical wind instrument to a student who is permitted to use or borrow the instrument while attending any public or commonwealth charter school or pre-kindergarten to grade 12, inclusive, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=28.26s">The</a>  school issuing the instrument shall inform the student's parent or guardian that the musical wind instrument has been sanitized and may also be sterilized at the expense of the parent or guardian requesting sterilization to ensure that all microbial life has been eradicated from the instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=45.201s">The</a>  parent or guardian may request that the school sterilize the instrument prior to issuance in compliance with regulations promulgated by the Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=52.364s">The</a>  parent or guardian who makes the request shall be responsible for the entire cost of the sterilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=57.306s">Small</a>  b, this section shall take effect in any city, town, or regional school district upon acceptance by the school committee, or in the case of a Commonwealth charter school, upon acceptance by the Board of Trustees, respectfully submitted by myself, Mayor Stephanie M. Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=70.912s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=71.553s">We</a>  also have Solicitor Rumley here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=72.974s">I</a>  don't know if he wanted to say a few words on this topic.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=79.82s">Thank</a>  you and good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Bellson, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=85.746s">This</a>  statute is what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=88.348s">It's</a>  a matter of notification and information <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=91.722s">to</a>  families, families whose students would be borrowing wind instruments. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=96.083s">And</a>  it's really very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=98.224s">What</a>  it says is that if a child or a student is borrowing a wind instrument, that they shall receive information that tells them that it's been sanitized, and the parents would also be told that they have the option at their own expense to have it sterilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=114.068s">And</a>  if that's done, then that would have to be done according to the standards of the Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=119.91s">So</a>  this is a matter of information so that families can better make informed decisions relative to their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=127.016s">And</a>  as I'll speak for the mayor, I would recommend your approval on this matter.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=132.421s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=133.141s">There's</a>  a motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=135.703s">Wierndekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=136.544s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=140.37s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=141.431s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=142.912s">I</a>  had a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=144.033s">Before</a>  we incur this cost onto the parents, we need to know what the cost is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=148.517s">Because</a>  I know what we want to do is encourage the most amount of participation in our music programs as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=155.983s">And</a>  we don't want to put an undue hardship on anyone who wants to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=160.575s">So</a>  I'd like to know how long the sanitation lasts for, like if someone borrows it and then they turn it back in, is it then re-sanitized before the next student were to borrow it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=172.605s">How</a>  that works? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=173.626s">Like</a>  I really have a lot of questions before we move this forward.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=177.469s">Yes,</a>  well I'm not a clinician, nor am I a doctor, nor am I a scientist of any nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=183.273s">But</a>  in the information that I have been reviewing in preparation for tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=188.062s">I</a>  can just tell you that the suggestion is that an instrument be sanitized once per year as it's given to a child who's borrowing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=196.949s">I</a>  mean, excuse me, sterilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=198.791s">If</a>  the family opts to do that, they need not.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=203.294s">So</a>  it just, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=208.038s">So</a>  say I'm a parent and my student wants to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=211.941s">How</a>  many wind instruments do we lend on a year?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=215.664s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=218.825s">So</a>  I spoke to the music department. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=221.847s">There</a>  are currently 76 wind instruments that have been rented at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=226.829s">Most</a>  of them at the elementary level, there are about 66, another 10 at the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=232.212s">Most</a>  of the instruments beyond the middle school are either owned by the individuals or, well, they are owned by the individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=237.895s">By</a>  that time, they've paid for them if they've worked them up all the way up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=241.857s">So</a>  we currently have about 76 instruments that are rented in the school system, mostly at the elementary level.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=248.032s">So</a>  they're not borrowed, so they wouldn't come under this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=250.453s">They're</a>  rented, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=251.513s">No,</a>  they're rented from a private company, but that's not, this wording says borrowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=257.334s">That's</a>  very different, because as a parent, I rented a saxophone for years, and you rent it to own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=263.955s">Actually,</a>  my son still has it, and I heard him playing it about a month ago when I pulled up, which I was very happy to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=272.355s">He</a>  rented to own this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=273.836s">So</a>  when he got it, it was always his. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=276.397s">It</a>  actually was sterilized because in the very beginning, Dr. LaPore provided that to everybody in all the Method students when he was first bringing this program forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=286.881s">So</a>  it had been sterilized.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=288.682s">So</a>  Madam Mayor, if I can, the third word is issuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=292.763s">It's</a>  not borrow, loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=294.864s">It's</a>  issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=295.925s">Issued</a>  from the school department, whether it's issued on a lease purchase or issued as a pure rental.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=301.712s">So</a>  my understanding from reading this, Mr. Belson, was that the school department's inventory of instruments that we were lending out, and I'm like, I didn't know we lent out wind instruments because that's why we had a private company. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=316.776s">Wouldn't</a>  the private company be responsible for providing clean instruments?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=320.997s">But</a>  they're contracted by the school department to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=323.978s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=324.818s">So</a>  as a result, the school department is issuing it through the private company. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=328.765s">on</a>  behalf of the school department.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=330.607s">At</a>  the cost to the parent to have the sterilization.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=334.31s">If</a>  I think I'm correct, I spoke to Mr. Casey, who unfortunately can't be here because he's not feeling well at this point, but he told me that for Medford students, they are issuing it at about $100 for a wind instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=347.527s">for</a>  the year, which is well below market. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=350.729s">So</a>  they issue to another school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=353.59s">I</a>  think he says he rents to about 127 different school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=357.172s">It's</a>  $25 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=358.973s">In</a>  Medford, it's $100 for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=361.895s">So</a>  it's a very sharp discount for a Medford student, Jack, as a graduate of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=366.375s">And</a>  we obviously feel some obligation.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=369.456s">So</a>  what is the cost incurred by a parent whose child wants to rent an instrument?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=374.897s">The</a>  last cost I saw for a typical wind instrument, trumpet, a clarinet, something of that type, and please correct me if I'm wrong, was approximately $125 for the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=384.68s">I</a>  would say that that's the neighborhood, but it is not necessarily the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=391.002s">A</a>  larger instrument, for example, a typical kid wouldn't buy a tuba. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=394.733s">I</a>  mean, you know, that's something we would do and then we would have to be responsible for that.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=398.155s">So</a>  I understand the importance of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=401.396s">So</a>  in the health, the health piece and why it's important to have this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=408.92s">Um,</a>  so if I had a child who went in the fifth grade and picked a wind instrument, they would pay the a hundred dollars a year to rent to own this instrument until they paid it off typically, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=423.247s">Which,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=424.098s">Our</a>  saxophone back then was like seven, $800 total through the lifetime at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=430.621s">And</a>  then another $125 for have it sanitized when they initially get sterilized.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=436.905s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=437.885s">Sterilized</a>  parents chose for that option.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=441.627s">So</a>  what would this mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=443.108s">Mr.</a>  Only we have to inform them that they have the option to or that they have to, there are two elements of the information.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=449.511s">The</a>  first information is on the notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=452.638s">The</a>  first information that they receive is that the instrument has been sanitized. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=457.779s">And</a>  if the parents so choose, it may be sterilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=463.0s">And</a>  if they do choose that option, then it would be done at their expense.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=467.521s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=468.501s">So</a>  this is entirely the effect of this from a legal point of view, from a functional point of view or an administrative point of view is for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=477.823s">That</a>  is the city to provide notice to family.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=482.443s">that</a>  it's not been sterilized and they have that option. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=487.207s">And</a>  we're by no means mandating this in any way or encouraging it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=491.571s">It's</a>  each individual's choice.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=494.954s">Notification.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=495.874s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=497.015s">For</a>  example, were I a parent of a child in the school system borrowing an instrument, myself and my wife would garner the information that we could about sanitation and sterilization, and then we'd make a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=509.086s">And</a>  that's really what families should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=511.153s">make</a>  choices that benefit their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=514.035s">And</a>  that's what the government, that's what the school department should be doing, to assist them to fully and functionally make that choice.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=526.104s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=526.264s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=527.084s">I</a>  just did have a question about the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=529.366s">I</a>  thought it was significantly lower when you and I talked, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=534.63s">There</a>  are people here who would like to address the specifics such as cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=540.324s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=540.704s">That's</a>  the number I get.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=541.884s">Mr.</a>  Stone, would you like to comment now or do you want to wait for an answer?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=545.365s">Well,</a>  I think they're going to speak and someone could speak on the cost.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=552.026s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=552.726s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=554.187s">Victor</a>  Garrow, lawyer, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=556.987s">I</a>  am a consultant for Dr. Lepore and his company. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=561.448s">Um,</a>  Mr. Belzer, can I ask you where you got that figure of $125? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=564.088s">I</a>  got that from Jack Casey. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=568.234s">How</a>  could he, he doesn't, he doesn't sterilize instruments though.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=570.755s">No,</a>  but that's what he told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=571.975s">I</a>  asked him what the cost would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=573.115s">And</a>  he said, that's what it would be.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=574.436s">Well,</a>  he can't sterilize because there's only, there's only one person that gets sterilized and that's his company.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=578.537s">I</a>  didn't say he could sterilize. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=579.857s">I</a>  asked him what he thought the cost was since he did, you know, I thought he would know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=583.918s">Well,</a>  he's way off.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=584.758s">I'm</a>  wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=586.019s">He's</a>  way off.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=586.659s">So</a>  therefore let me, I will answer your question.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=589.12s">So</a>  Mr. Belson, just to remind you, the other day when you and I talked, you may have forgotten this, but you told me it was about $40 per instrument.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=595.202s">I</a>  don't remember that, but if it's, if it's less, it's less. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=599.806s">It's</a>  much less.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=601.167s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=601.488s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=602.068s">The,</a>  uh, you know, what's interesting, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee is that everybody knows Dr. Lepore. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=612.117s">Anybody</a>  could have called up Dr. Lepore and say, how much does it cost to have an instrument sterilized? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=619.951s">Now</a>  let me explain a little bit about the term sterilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=624.012s">You</a>  will notice that in the statute itself, the state, now this is not us, this is the state, is stating that if you have a sanitized wind instrument, that does not kill all the germs within the instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=642.419s">There</a>  is only one way you can kill all microbial life as stated <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=648.125s">in</a>  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=650.506s">And</a>  that is by sterilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=653.408s">So</a>  that when a parent makes the decision of, do I want to have it sterilized or not, but they have to have some information, such as, what type of germs are found within some of these instruments? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=666.274s">Now,</a>  there's been several tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=669.416s">There</a>  have been several reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=671.016s">And</a>  it seems a lot of people haven't read them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=674.498s">And</a>  what it stated is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=676.758s">And</a>  I want everybody that's listening on TV to understand what we're saying here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=681.121s">That</a>  in these instruments, one of the things that has been found by the doctors who have done these and the research people is, they find mold. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=691.682s">I</a>  want any doctor to come up here and say that it is perfectly healthy for a child to inhale mold. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=700.086s">What</a>  happens in the school system, Madam Mayor, Mr. Belzin, when you find mold? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=704.869s">You</a>  shut down the school, you break down the walls, you get all that mold. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=709.411s">Mold</a>  is going into their mouth and into their system. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=712.273s">This</a>  is the gateway to your health or not healthy, is here through your mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=717.397s">And</a>  so what happens is the microbial germs that are there do not get killed unless you sterilize. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=726.905s">And</a>  sterilization is done by ethylene oxide, which is used in 50 to 60% of all medical instruments in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=739.34s">Everything</a>  that is put into a person's heart, into their body, is sterilized with ethylene oxide. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=748.427s">And</a>  that is the only way that you can kill all microbial life in an instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=755.313s">That's</a>  what does it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=756.774s">And</a>  it's done pursuant to the EPA and the FDA, always looking at the places that do this to the instruments to make sure that it's safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=768.248s">There</a>  has never been a problem ever with the sterilization of ethylene oxide. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=775.174s">There's</a>  been a lot of misinformation out here that I'm very privy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=781.599s">And</a>  I will say to you that it's shocking what's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=786.923s">That's</a>  why I'm up here speaking today, because it's not going to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=791.346s">There's</a>  been something going on behind the scenes that I will get to the bottom of. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=796.497s">Because</a>  I think there's some hidden agendas involved with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=801.398s">And</a>  I've been a lawyer for a lot of years.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=805.239s">Madam</a>  Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=805.619s">Thank</a>  you Mr. Garrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=806.219s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=806.859s">Van</a>  der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=807.719s">So,</a>  you've said a lot of things and I need to tell you that as a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=813.961s">First</a>  of all, because I know many of the people who are involved in this company and have known them over years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=819.647s">because</a>  of their professional positions in Medford and as Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=824.131s">That</a>  in fact, in my eyes, the way to look at this statute is to say, what does the statute say? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=830.436s">And</a>  in fact, if you would, divorce myself from the people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=835.439s">The</a>  statute says that we should be telling parents that there is a option for sanitation, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=845.484s">Sterilization.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=846.185s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=846.525s">Sterilization.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=847.826s">Period.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=848.346s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=848.947s">That's</a>  what the statute says. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=850.108s">And</a>  what I understand us to be voting on tonight is simply, are we going to accept it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=854.631s">And</a>  then incumbent on us is to let parents know whose children are renting instruments, um, uh, that they should be, um, that, that there is this option and it is an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=867.021s">That's</a>  what I'm voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=868.282s">If</a>  I have some blinders on, it's purposeful because I don't want to get involved with personalities or, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=875.144s">I</a>  think it's, for me, it's a clear cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=877.665s">There's</a>  a statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=879.006s">It</a>  says that this would be, that's what the legislature has told us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=883.969s">I</a>  don't have any hidden agenda.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=885.81s">No,</a>  you don't.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=886.37s">That's</a>  exactly correct interpretation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=889.632s">By</a>  the way- Ms.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=890.213s">Mustone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=890.953s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=891.153s">Mustone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=891.654s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=892.094s">Yes,</a>  how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=893.675s">So</a>  I have gone to the high school three times for my oldest three to try out instruments to see what they would like to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=899.917s">We</a>  send the audit form in, and then the instrument arrives at the Roberts Elementary School in my, well now they're eighth, sixth, and fifth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=907.019s">They</a>  pick up their instrument, and I don't have to worry about picking up, dropping off. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=911.36s">It's</a>  very nicely done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=913.081s">So</a>  how does the sterilization work into it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=915.601s">Would</a>  the rental company bring them to your company, and then bring them back to the elementary school?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=921.203s">What</a>  has happened in the past, Dr. Lepore did this for three years here within the city, 2006, 2007, and 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=930.373s">And</a>  at that time, all instruments, I believe you believe you were for that at that time, Mr. Bellson, that the instruments that all instruments from the city were done free of charge by Dr. Lepore's company, not one penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=944.703s">What</a>  was charged is to Mr. Casey. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=947.105s">He</a>  was charged $40 per instrument approximately. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=950.907s">And</a>  he added on $35 for his, his handling and his profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=956.011s">And</a>  that's done over a nine or 10 month period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=959.07s">So</a>  it would add maybe $6 or $7 on to the leasing agreement on a lease to buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=964.455s">So</a>  if you had a clarinet and you were leasing it for $30, the parent then could be told it'll probably cost you $38 to make sure that there is no microbial life or germs within your instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=977.567s">That</a>  would be up to the parent to decide.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=981.751s">but</a>  as a parent, I don't have to pick it up, bring it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=984.215s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=984.896s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=985.296s">Because</a>  that would be, that would be, that would be, that'd be done with Mr. Bellson and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=989.903s">I</a>  mean the, the, uh, school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=992.127s">I</a>  mean, yes, the school department and the people that are there at the music part.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=999.398s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1000.379s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1003.6s">Van</a>  der Kloot, Mr. Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1005.5s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1006.581s">So</a>  you're saying it's $40 for this?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1008.902s">It</a>  would approximately- About $40, and then another $35 for the- It's probably in the vicinity of $70 to $75 for the whole thing.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1016.825s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1018.825s">And</a>  it's an option for parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1020.506s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1021.306s">So</a>  for health reasons, how often should parents <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1027.468s">get</a>  the instruments re-sterilized.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1030.17s">On</a>  the studies that have been done, the standard is that when it goes from one student to the next and before it's given out to the next student, it should be then sterilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1041.577s">So</a>  at the beginning of the school year, it should be sterilized for that student for the year.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1046.861s">So</a>  what happens when you rent to own is you keep that same instrument for seven or eight years and then you own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1054.676s">I'm</a>  asking.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1056.277s">Every</a>  year, you should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1058.257s">I</a>  don't know if the school committee knows of this, but it's been said many times, gee, no one's got sick, why should we be doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1066.401s">Well,</a>  a person just died from self-contamination of a musical wind instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1073.243s">Died</a>  from it in England. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1076.044s">And</a>  what happened was, the man died in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1080.597s">And</a>  he had spent seven or eight years in coughing and with problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1084.539s">He</a>  was getting weaker and weaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1086.54s">The</a>  doctors over in England that were treating him in the hospital couldn't figure out what was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1091.242s">So</a>  they were giving him all types of medications that were known to them to try to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1096.084s">It</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1096.824s">He</a>  was dying. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1098.345s">And</a>  it's self, it was self-contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1100.986s">It</a>  didn't go from person to student to student to student. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1105.087s">You</a>  can self-contaminate your own wind instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1109.24s">So</a>  therefore, I'm telling everybody that has an instrument, if you have an instrument, you should have it sterilized once a year because you can self-contaminate your own instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1120.527s">And</a>  by the way, when people say they haven't been getting sick, let me tell you the sicknesses that it causes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1127.171s">It</a>  can cause flu. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1128.712s">It</a>  can cause the virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1130.213s">It</a>  can cause headaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1131.533s">It</a>  can cause coughing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1132.954s">It</a>  can cause diarrhea. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1134.635s">It</a>  can cause headaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1136.356s">It</a>  can cause asthma. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1137.816s">It</a>  can cause bronchitis. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1139.437s">It</a>  can cause feeling sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1141.838s">It</a>  can cause ear problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1144.98s">And</a>  all of these things over the years, no one has ever put the dots to say, hey, you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1150.283s">This</a>  might have come from the musical instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1152.684s">Well,</a>  now you can start thinking, I was saying, if the state <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1156.966s">And</a>  there's been several hearings on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1159.047s">The</a>  state has said that the only way to ensure that all microbial life has been eradicated within the instrument is through sterilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1167.792s">That's</a>  our Commonwealth of Massachusetts saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1170.194s">That's</a>  not our company that's saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1172.055s">That's</a>  the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1173.916s">So</a>  therefore, what happens here is all we're saying here is give notice to the parents and let them make that decision themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1181.62s">But</a>  just understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1183.561s">A</a>  lot of people have got sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1185.463s">One</a>  has died. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1186.684s">Now,</a>  the only reason why they were able to find out why he died was the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1193.37s">In</a>  2014, he died. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1195.151s">But</a>  there were six or seven doctors over in England at this hospital who were doing work for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1201.957s">And</a>  the medical examiner said he died of a lung condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1207.626s">They</a>  said, no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1208.687s">There's</a>  something more wrong with this than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1211.488s">We</a>  have to determine what really happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1213.69s">It</a>  took them two years, Madam Mayor, of research to find out what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1218.833s">So</a>  what they did is they finally went into the gentleman's home with the consent of the family, and they found this bagpipe wind instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1228.719s">And</a>  they said, you know something, let's take that for our researchers and let them go and check out what was going on and what was wrong in the instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1236.705s">What</a>  they found, they couldn't believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1239.286s">There</a>  was all types of mold, fungi, and all other things that cause real serious problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1245.95s">The</a>  poor man died from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1248.272s">He</a>  died from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1250.473s">So</a>  when we're saying this, but if these doctors didn't work for two years, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1256.58s">to</a>  figure out what was going on, it would have been another undocumented death that wouldn't be related to musical wind instruments. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1264.948s">I'm</a>  telling you ladies and gentlemen.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1266.289s">Sir,</a>  getting back to my question, I just want people to be aware that the recommendation is to have it sterilized every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1274.257s">And</a>  rather the first year, you get your instrument from the rental company. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1280.242s">At</a>  that point, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1281.628s">If</a>  you brought it yourself back to the company to have it sterilized, it would be an additional $40 each year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1288.313s">But</a>  it would seem to me that this would be done through the school itself.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1294.097s">So</a>  then we're putting regulations on our music department that is already working understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1303.82s">to</a>  take on this responsibility and I'd like to hear from the superintendent about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1307.684s">I</a>  have no problem with this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1308.785s">What</a>  responsibility?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1310.146s">Of</a>  collecting all these 75 instruments, transporting them back to Dr. Lepore's business and having them sterilized.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1316.473s">No,</a>  we would be picking up, we'd be picking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1318.054s">This</a>  is not, this is not, by the way, I think there was a misstatement by Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1322.859s">There</a>  are not 76 instruments being used in the high school by people in the band. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1327.86s">We're</a>  talking about those that Mr. Casey has because he is leasing instruments. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1334.526s">That's</a>  not what the statute is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1337.028s">Statute</a>  is talking about what the school, you don't issue it through Mr. Casey. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1343.813s">It's</a>  Mr. Casey's business and he has business with the city and you as the city can say, if you are giving any of these least instruments to our people, we want you to sterilize them first. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1354.743s">And</a>  then you're out of all the problems because he has to handle them or the company has to handle them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1359.568s">He</a>  has thousands of instruments. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1361.549s">He</a>  can put them to all the way and there's no other problems.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1364.432s">But</a>  if we do that, then we're taking out the option of the parents' choice to have that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1369.114s">No,</a>  they make that choice.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1369.894s">This</a>  is informational to the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1372.115s">Notification</a>  to the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1373.496s">That's</a>  what this general law is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1375.456s">Providing</a>  notification to the parents and then it's up to them to take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1379.018s">If</a>  they so please, they may look up research and disagree with the findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1382.739s">It's</a>  totally at the parents' wishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1385.1s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1385.26s">Van</a>  der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1386.821s">The</a>  one concern that I do have is I think that it's incumbent on <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1391.214s">us</a>  that we want to make sure that the flyer which is going out to the parents is acceptable to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1398.59s">I</a>  think it probably should have a website for the parents attached to it for more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1404.152s">I</a>  don't want to scare every parent thinking that their kid now is going to die if they don't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1410.455s">I</a>  think that we want to let them know that it is an option for them and consistent with the statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1417.118s">So</a>  I just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1418.438s">I</a>  haven't seen a flyer yet that would go out to the parent, but rather than that flyer going directly to the music company or through whatever, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1427.422s">I</a>  want to make sure that we have administrative oversight of that flyer.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1432.244s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1433.884s">So,</a>  let's clarify a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1436.645s">The</a>  statute says that when the school department issues something for a student to use or borrow, to use or borrow, not own, to use or borrow, then we have to notify parents of this option. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1452.351s">Now,</a>  it's incumbent upon us to give them <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1457.258s">The</a>  pros, maybe some cons if there are, as to why they would or wouldn't do this, the pricing, and to tell them how it works and how to access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1467.012s">Now,</a>  as far as the school department doing it, if we set up a system where people can bring their instruments to us so we can give them to the appropriate company, that's easily done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1479.015s">It's</a>  not difficult to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1480.956s">So</a>  I don't have a problem doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1482.976s">The</a>  issue is really more of setting up a system, providing appropriate flyer, which I'll provide to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1489.378s">We</a>  do have one issue, and maybe an attorney can enlighten us on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1493.642s">is</a>  to whether or not there's more than one company, because obviously we have bid laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1497.986s">Is</a>  there one more than one company at this time?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1499.667s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1500.328s">So</a>  in other words, saying if we put something out, this might be a sole source. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1503.471s">And</a>  if it's a sole source, we put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1505.393s">But</a>  if another source were to show up, we would have to, over time, explain that to people that they have that option as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1512.519s">But</a>  in the interim, it's not a difficult thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1516.402s">It's</a>  just that we want to provide appropriate notification <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1519.57s">Nothing</a>  wrong with providing appropriate notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1522.031s">And</a>  people can make up their own mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1524.512s">And</a>  if they believe that this is in their best interest, then fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1527.713s">If</a>  they don't believe it's in their best interest, then that's a choice they can make. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1532.374s">So</a>  that's what we're involved with. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1534.795s">The</a>  statute is not a difficult one to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1536.856s">It's</a>  really a question of how we have people access it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1541.398s">I</a>  agree, Mr. Bilson.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1543.758s">I</a>  was going to suggest we move the question.</p>

Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1646.956s">The</a>  Medford School Committee support the Medford Conversations Project to promote dialogue and collaboration about race and ethnicity in Medford and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1655.061s">And</a>  there's actually a full resolution that's in your packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1659.923s">It</a>  was presented to the city council last Tuesday evening, and it passed 7 to 0. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1664.566s">And</a>  if I could read the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1667.008s">Whereas</a>  the strength of our nation is derived from its history of diversity that has enriched our communities with a variety of cultures, faiths, traditions, and viewpoints. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1675.112s">And</a>  whereas the City of Medford is a community that welcomes and values the varied racial and ethnic makeup of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1681.093s">And</a>  whereas the City of Medford stands in support of all immigrant groups and newcomers as they pursue the American dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1686.815s">And</a>  whereas the City of Medford will work to model our city as a safe and welcoming place that equally encourages all to seek personal advancement and to reside in peaceful contentment in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1697.317s">Whereas</a>  the city of Medford rejects all words and acts of hate, indifference, and intolerance that undermine our neighborhoods, communities of faith, and our schools, and thwart the promise of equal justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1708.166s">And</a>  whereas our nation was founded on the fundamental principle that all persons are entitled to equal protection of law, equal opportunity, and to the enjoyment of civil and human rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1717.253s">Now,</a>  therefore, the city of Medford proudly supports the Medford Conversations Project to promote dialogue and collaboration about race and ethnicity in Medford and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1726.7s">And</a>  I believe we have Mr. D.

    <p>[7G1mRGUN6Dk_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1739.828s">Reverend</a>  Wendy Miller-Olapade, 105 Brooks Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1744.29s">I'm</a>  the... Welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1745.311s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1745.831s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1746.852s">I'm</a>  so delighted to be with you tonight on behalf of the Medford Conversations Project <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1753.961s">I'm</a>  the lead pastor of Sanctuary United Church of Christ and I'm participating in the planning team of the Medford Conversations Project as a member of the Medford Interfaith Clergy Association and a member of Medford Health Matters, which reflects a little bit about the diversity of the bodies that are engaged in planning for that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1776.121s">So</a>  I'm here just to speak to what the project is and answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1780.525s">We</a>  have others here if you have further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1783.767s">Medford</a>  Conversations' mission is to include and actively engage a wide range, a multiplicity of voices in our community, and through those conversations, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1793.29s">hope</a>  to encourage people to create and act on visions for a sustainable, just, and thriving Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1801.131s">So</a>  out of a model based on the everyday democracy way of creating conversations across diverse networks in communities, we hope to bring people together to talk about what they care about, to make Medford a better place to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1823.182s">And</a>  we're actively seeking to bring people from across different cultures, races, religions, economic background, neighborhoods, generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1836.27s">So</a>  we're actively trying to get people into the room for our first conversation, which is in January, designed to discuss who belongs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1847.976s">It'll</a>  be a dialogue about race and ethnicity <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1851.048s">in</a>  Medford and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1853.009s">So</a>  let me stop there and see if you have any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1855.93s">I</a>  don't know if you've heard about this yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1857.371s">I</a>  have a little handout for you if you'd like to, it's just the invitation to the actual first event. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1864.854s">The</a>  intention is that the conversations project would be a model that we would continue to use to address different topics as time goes on.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1877.1s">Thank</a>  you very much, Reverend Wendy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1879.612s">Is</a>  there anyone else that would like to speak on this resolution before us this evening? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1888.458s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1888.938s">Your</a>  name and address, please.</p>

    <p>[Steve Schnapp]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1889.819s">My</a>  name is Steve Schnapp. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1891.76s">The</a>  last name is spelled S-E-H-N-A-P-P. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1894.562s">I</a>  live at 36 Hillside Ave, right up the street from the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1898.364s">I</a>  got involved in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1900.125s">I'm</a>  retired, but I got involved in this project because I think it's particularly important <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1905.036s">that</a>  folks across difference, as Reverend Wendy explained, engage with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1910.597s">And</a>  the only point I would like to add to what's been said already is in addition to your support, we actually need your help in being able to attract folks who may not have what I would call a racial justice frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1927.658s">Folks</a>  who may be leery to participate because they don't want to get beat up or called a racist or in some way feel bad about the particular views they may hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1942.743s">We</a>  really want to engage people across difference and that is political difference and the way they see the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1948.523s">This</a>  conversation is an attempt to get to know people, for people to get to know each other, to build relationships, and therefore to begin to address the very important issues of race and diversity and ethnicity, et cetera, that are dividing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1963.995s">It's</a>  an attempt to get folks to talk to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1966.797s">And</a>  we need your help to identify and help us bring those folks into these conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1972.758s">We're</a>  asking that of all sorts of organizations across the city, individuals, political folks, but others as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1980.228s">So</a>  if there are folks that you can think of who may be civic-minded or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1986.289s">but</a>  want to engage in conversations that may be difficult but will be facilitated so that all voices can be heard and respected, we really invite you to share those individuals with us or hand out literature that just tells about what this program is and this project.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2006.725s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2008.906s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2009.086s">Mestone.</a> </p>

    <p>[7G1mRGUN6Dk_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2016.308s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2016.928s">I</a>  can give you electronic versions of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2021.87s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2023.19s">There</a>  is a desire for registration, but people can just show up as well to the opening thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2028.632s">I</a>  don't know how much time you want me to spend, but the design beyond the philosophy that this is a way <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2037.727s">to</a>  help people to stay engaged in their civic connections. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2042.19s">It's</a>  a way to really make sure that we're still being a democracy and that people, so one of the things we didn't say specifically is that Steve and Jen Bailey actually are leading the team that is gonna do training, so our facilitators will be trained by Everyday Democracy to be able to engage hot topics, if you will, some of those topics <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2066.142s">We</a>  don't want to talk about it over the Thanksgiving dinner table, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2070.103s">Hot</a>  topics that are hard to talk about when you have a difference of opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2074.325s">We'll</a>  have trained facilitators who will facilitate those conversations across difference, and it'll happen in small groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2082.807s">So</a>  there's a large opening event that will sort of set the stage and set expectations for what we hope to happen, and then there will be small groups of 10 to 12 persons who will gather together <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2095.55s">schedule</a>  with facilitators who will then dig deeper, listen to each other, and dig deeper on the topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2103.653s">And</a>  so then we come back together for a fifth session on this particular topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2109.455s">So</a>  we're hopeful that those facilitators will allow then for the improved dialogue across difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2118.322s">high</a>  school age is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2119.983s">We're</a>  still negotiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2122.464s">We're</a>  still in conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2123.705s">We're</a>  learning how to do this as we're going along by the grace of the goodness of good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2131.849s">We</a>  are not confident yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2134.33s">Originally</a>  we thought it would be <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2136.431s">you</a>  know, kids and adults and elders all in one circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2141.015s">But</a>  we've just recently talked about recognizing that a room full of, you know, a couple of youth in a group with a lot of voices might be hard for them to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2150.223s">So</a>  we're still trying to figure out whether we might do some small groups just for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2154.826s">My</a>  16-year-old is here because this is a topic that we talked about at the city council meeting last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2162.149s">And</a>  I recognized that there was nobody in the room when we were talking about it, either of color or of difference or young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2171.331s">And</a>  I asked him to come tonight to, you know, sort of just be in the room with me as we talked about this because, you know, we think that it's all okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2181.073s">We</a>  want to believe that this is the kind of community that we are and this is what we stand for. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2185.994s">And</a>  yet young people, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2188.218s">old</a>  people, people of color, people, Muslim people, we all know that we've struggled over the last year or so, and that there's an increase in fear and concern expressed by our community after the results of the election, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2201.903s">So,</a>  yeah, I think it is appropriate for teenagers, and we're trying to figure, we're working with Amie Saulnier, she's on the steering committee, and she's working really hard to make sure that the kids at this school are engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2216.253s">I'm</a>  trying to convince Aaron to be a facilitator actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2219.515s">So</a>  now I'm going public with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2224.437s">That</a>  website, yep, that website is on the home page. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2227.118s">If</a>  you go to the bottom, there's a whole registration process there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2230.24s">In</a>  fact, you can get the flyer from the website too. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2234.042s">Medfordconversations.org.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2235.362s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2236.343s">Thank</a>  you very much for being here tonight.</p>

    <p>[7G1mRGUN6Dk_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2238.504s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2241.52s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor for acceptance of the resolution by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2244.382s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2245.182s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2246.843s">Seconded</a>  by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2250.145s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2252.006s">It</a>  seems to me that our community has really, in general, in my understanding of it, meets a lot of these items listed as a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2265.594s">Whereas,</a>  I think the program is wonderful and I agree that it should be <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2271.038s">you</a>  know, engaged by many of our community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2276.919s">So</a>  that way we can have straightforward, honest discussion about any issue that might be the topic at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2284.481s">And</a>  I do encourage people to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2287.662s">I</a>  just don't know why it goes from a method conversations to a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2294.253s">Because</a>  I really feel that our community is very open and welcoming already without putting it forward in this manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2301.456s">So</a>  I just didn't, I just didn't.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2305.117s">It's</a>  to provide a unified voice that we will not accept acts of hatred and inequality. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2313.38s">That's</a>  not who we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2314.32s">That's</a>  not who we want to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2316.121s">And</a>  that we all speak united on that topic.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2318.822s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2319.482s">I,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2320.589s">I</a>  see that, but I feel like our community already does that in so many ways on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2324.931s">You</a>  see that a lot, but there are a lot that don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2327.853s">And</a>  to those out there, we're making a statement that it's important that we acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2332.895s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2334.456s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2336.597s">Madam</a>  Mayor, members of the committee, and Reverend, I think it's really important, given the climate that sometimes pervades our world, that we reemphasize not only to ourselves as adults, but to <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2350.468s">the</a>  students that this is important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2353.61s">And</a>  when the adults make a motion of this type, you're sending a message to the young people who perhaps have not thought it through as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2361.015s">And</a>  it's important for us to be able to say this is something that the adults have taken an active stand on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2366.718s">So</a>  that's another reason for doing it in a public body and especially in a school system where we have the care and responsibility of educating our young people about how to get along. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2378.447s">And</a>  we've talked a lot about social and emotional health. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2381.348s">We've</a>  talked a lot about some of the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2383.049s">And</a>  I have to tell you, the academic issues will take care of themselves over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2387.05s">The</a>  ones that won't are the social and emotional and the personal interactions of young people if we don't step up as role models and if we don't step up as voices to help them find voice as they grow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2402.495s">So</a>  to help them with their transition to adulthood, it's critical that we take <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2407.877s">visible</a>  stance on human issues, human rights, and human fairness.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2412.878s">So</a>  my only point was to say that I feel our schools district already does an exceptional job of making all our students feel welcome.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2423.82s">I</a>  think we do.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2424.58s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2425.68s">That's</a>  why I just wanted to say that I didn't want people to hear this and think that we have to make a resolution for these things to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2432.402s">This</a>  happens on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2435.001s">by</a>  the educators, our administrators, by our community, and by everybody here that we really care and we look at children. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2443.35s">That's</a>  children that we educate all and we support all in any needs that they need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2448.796s">So</a>  that was my concern.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2450.599s">I</a>  don't want people to say that this is something new, this is something I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2454.863s">It's</a>  our way of making a public statement that that is who we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2462.991s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2463.252s">Van</a>  der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2472.495s">And</a>  I understand, Erin, exactly what you're trying to say, that we've been a positive place and we want to keep on staying that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2479.08s">And</a>  that's why we're going to go ahead and say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2481.662s">I</a>  have to tell you, and neither of these incidents happened inside or with anybody involved in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2487.206s">But</a>  I have been shocked within the last two months of two very different incidents that were so outrageous to me personally of <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2496.635s">discrimination</a>  and, uh, inappropriate hate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2500.176s">Um,</a>  and one was, you know, I went to a craft show and I don't want to go into it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2505.218s">Although</a>  if anybody wants to know, I'll, I'll talk to you personally about what happened and something else which happened with words that were totally inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2512.821s">And</a>  somehow I feel that in the political climate that took place over the past year, it is unleashed a firestorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2518.523s">And</a>  so this is the appropriate time to go public and just to reaffirm our values.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2523.994s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2524.474s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2525.435s">And</a>  also, the superintendent and I are working on a PSA, trying to get the community involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2530.097s">So</a>  we'll probably be reaching out to Steve. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2532.698s">I</a>  think I sat at your table several months ago, and he did a great job facilitating that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2539.821s">And</a>  we'll be working probably with some in your group to try and put a PSA out that addresses some of these issues in a conversational forum of four people, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2548.866s">So</a>  we will be in touch with you in the very near future for that.</p>

    <p>[7G1mRGUN6Dk_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2552.937s">I</a>  think the other thing I want to share, I did this the other night at the council meeting and I won't go through the story again, but I think what's most important to me, particularly as a mother of a child who's not of the dominant culture, is that this model is designed to help us to listen to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2573.13s">And</a>  I spoke very passionately last Tuesday night at this microphone <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2579.461s">about</a>  the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2580.442s">It</a>  was a much more heated dialogue then than it is tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2584.787s">And</a>  I received hate mail at the church two days ago, someone calling me a demon and that I had an inappropriate <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2595.793s">agenda,</a>  that I had exploited my child. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2601.795s">And</a>  so I share that with you to say that while we generally feel as though we're doing a really great job, and we are doing a great job, and there's still so much work to be done, we have so far to go as a society to really, really love one another in the way that <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2622.041s">we</a>  have in our souls. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2623.582s">You</a>  know, our guts feel that and yet we are blinded by our experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2628.986s">And</a>  so we have, you know, this conversation, making a public statement is just another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2636.131s">I</a>  sat, you know, at the Arabic club after the Hijab Day situation and watched those children cry because their experience was being denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2645.878s">So</a>  we're doing a great job and we have more work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2649.621s">So</a>  thank you for your <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2651.13s">for</a>  your time and your attention and your commitment.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2654.112s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2655.954s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2659.176s">Van</a>  der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2660.957s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2661.838s">Ms.</a> </p>
