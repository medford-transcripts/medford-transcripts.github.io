1
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Mayor and members of the School Committee, you have the paper in front of you.

2
00:01:49,841 --> 00:02:01,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to call upon our Deputy Superintendent to make the introductions of Team Medford, who have been incredibly generous to us, not only this year, but throughout the years, providing school supplies to our teachers and our students.

3
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:12,848
[SPEAKER_10]: So this year, the past nine years, I'm happy to say, a highlight of our first School Committee meeting agenda has been the recognition and thanks to Team Medford

4
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:16,774
[SPEAKER_10]: for all their efforts in collecting supplies for our teachers and students.

5
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:24,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to invite our team members here tonight with us, and that's Sam and Janet and Luke.

6
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:26,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to come up with me?

7
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:27,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

8
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:42,498
[SPEAKER_10]: As you all know, the supply drive is organized by Sam, who every year contacts my office asking if he can do the supply again this year, and of course,

9
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:43,895
[SPEAKER_10]: The answer is yes.

10
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:49,018
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition to collecting regular school supplies, he takes special requests.

11
00:02:49,158 --> 00:03:00,903
[SPEAKER_10]: And this year, Diane Caldwell asked that they have some pencil cases for elementary youngsters, and we're happy to say that every elementary student did receive one in the supplies that came in.

12
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:03,824
[SPEAKER_10]: We always ask for copy paper.

13
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:05,124
[SPEAKER_10]: That's always in high demand.

14
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:10,947
[SPEAKER_10]: This year we got over 80 cases, and we give that out equitably to the different schools and departments.

15
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:22,038
[SPEAKER_10]: This year, we're happy to report that the dollar amount of our supplies was up to $27,000, and that's $7,000 more, I believe, than last year.

16
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:23,279
[SPEAKER_10]: So we thank you greatly.

17
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Staples is once again our major sponsor.

18
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:29,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Joe Arrabo is Team Medford's representative.

19
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:30,626
[SPEAKER_10]: He can't be here.

20
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:34,469
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he's in Italy, and I think those two choices, Medford or Italy, Italy won out on that one.

21
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:46,287
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, additional donations were collected by Kiwanis, Armstrong Ambulance, Cataldo Ambulance, Courtyard Nursing Home, and the Andrews Middle School PTA.

22
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:55,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, we had supplies delivered to the high school on September, I'm sorry, on August 25th.

23
00:03:55,634 --> 00:04:05,982
[SPEAKER_10]: We are deeply indebted to John McLaughlin and his team for getting everything organized so that everything was packaged and ready to go to schools and

24
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:10,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Principals picked supplies up or had them shipped to their schools by the first day of school.

25
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:21,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, this wonderful effort is an example of how different constituencies in a community can come together for a very positive and powerful result.

26
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:25,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And we sincerely thank everyone who participated.

27
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:31,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to turn this over to Sam, who obviously is a very favorite person of mine.

28
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:32,443
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Sam.

29
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:35,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

30
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:36,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everyone.

31
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:39,549
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is an exciting time.

32
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:46,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time June comes, I mean, I had it on my calendar, make sure you connect with Beverly and go through the process.

33
00:04:47,014 --> 00:05:01,763
[SPEAKER_00]: But team Medford, you know, we've been, I would say since the merger that occurred back about 1998, the team has been put together with volunteers of multiple departments, employees like Lou and Janet and many others.

34
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:03,925
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take pride of what we do.

35
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:11,280
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that we needed to communicate and connect the community to our hospital, Lawrence Memorial.

36
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:16,965
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea came as far as, you know, how do we also connect to the school system?

37
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,007
[SPEAKER_00]: And back to school drive was really

38
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:45,764
[SPEAKER_00]: something unanimously everybody energize certainly thanks to Lou we keep him connected with us because staples he has been instrumental in getting staples to be our major sponsor that's been year after year after year for the past nine years so I really without this theme that's some of them are here and a lot of them are different meetings at home we do meet every month and we really have programs and we're already set up for

39
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:51,464
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Tufts Community Day, the health fairs, and we're also going to be back at the school on the 28th.

40
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:58,266
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will have Dr. Chandler and a few others, because we really want to make sure that Lawrence Memorial Hospital is here to stay.

41
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:03,447
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been members of their employees and staff.

42
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:06,048
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been with the system for 44 years.

43
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:07,709
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, Lou, you've, you know, 44.

44
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:11,420
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all committed.

45
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:20,506
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope and I know for sure that I will make that call next June to Beverly to try to get even more than 27,000.

46
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,029
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you for allowing us to do this.

47
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,530
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're happy to do it year after year after year.

48
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:27,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

49
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:30,693
[SPEAKER_05]: On behalf of the entire city, we thank you and the whole team.

50
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:32,935
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could just list the names of the other people.

51
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:54,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Natella Taylor, Courtyard Nursing Home, Derek Marshine, Courtyard Nursing Home, Kelsey Flynn of Armstrong Ambulance, and Meredith Lambrook, also of Armstrong, Jesse Calvo of Hallmark, Mark Nicholas, Cataldo Ambulance, and Paul DeLiva, the principal of the Andrews, Janet Peralt, Hallmark Health, Lou Bracco, who's here tonight from the hospital, Sam is here as well.

52
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:55,332
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Janet.

53
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:57,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

54
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:01,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all so, so much on behalf of the students and our entire community.

55
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,619
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate the hard work you put in on the kids' behalf.

56
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:33,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm here members of the committee.

57
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:43,198
[SPEAKER_08]: We did give you a preliminary report on August 29th and update that this evening and go over a few things that maybe you didn't get at that time.

58
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,159
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've had eight days of school.

59
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:52,096
[SPEAKER_08]: for the last two weeks, and the kindergartners had four days of school, and we've had a pretty good overall opening.

60
00:07:52,876 --> 00:08:01,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Student enrollment is still emerging, as our parent center continues to receive daily activity, enrollees coming from many places.

61
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:09,739
[SPEAKER_08]: And as of Friday, September 9th, our overall enrollment is, at this point in time, 37 students less than last year at this time.

62
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:12,319
[SPEAKER_08]: The current numbers are as follows.

63
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Elementary, 1,882.

64
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:17,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Less, about two than last year.

65
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,634
[SPEAKER_08]: The middle school, 943, an increase of 51.

66
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:25,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And the high school vocational school, 1365, a reduction of 86.

67
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:31,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, last year's eighth grade class was much lower than the previous class.

68
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:38,540
[SPEAKER_08]: That explains some of it, but, you know, at this particular point in time, I think it's probably on percentage about the same going to the high school.

69
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:43,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Det är förväntat att de här utbildningsnivåerna förändras i september.

70
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Det kommer studenter att registrera sig, och några studenter kommer att flytta.

71
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:48,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Det här är typiskt.

72
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:54,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Dessutom måste distributionen mellan högskolan och vocational school fortfarande refineras.

73
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:59,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Det är för att vi samarbetar och gör saker samtidigt, så det är mer än 101 studenter i 9. klasse

74
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:11,905
[SPEAKER_08]: to the vocational school and exploratory, even though the vocational ninth grade is only about 52 students.

75
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:24,031
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get the idea that there's another 50 plus students, or there are around 50 students coming from the high school in the ninth grade exploring programs, and there's other youngsters in the other grades exploring programs as well.

76
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:28,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are students coming from the vocational school taking courses at the high school.

77
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:34,235
[SPEAKER_08]: So as we merge, some of these lines will blur a little bit, but we need to break it out

78
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,387
[SPEAKER_08]: for reporting purposes.

79
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:42,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Class sizes across the district are good and well within contractual limits.

80
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:54,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I've provided a chart to you that Diane's office has produced with Michelle Bissell working at it, talking to all the principals every day to make sure that we get actual headcounts.

81
00:09:54,871 --> 00:10:02,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Diane actually went down and did some headcounts today to be sure that the number registered and the numbers actually in attendance are reconciled.

82
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:16,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And the secondary school looks pretty good also, but we'll wait a few more days until we see how classes are redistributed as people change courses and make some adjustments as to what they're taking.

83
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:26,169
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, we made four administrative appointments that filled vacancies covered by two resignations, one retirement, and one promotion.

84
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:33,455
[SPEAKER_08]: And we reduced one administrative position in the special education budget during budget time.

85
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:41,805
[SPEAKER_08]: There were 32 new teachers hired to fill gaps caused by resignations, retirements, leaves of absence, and non-rehires.

86
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:50,048
[SPEAKER_08]: And there were multiple shifts of teachers to different positions to better address enrollment and program needs based on individual building preferences.

87
00:10:50,829 --> 00:11:03,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, we hired a few new positions based on our budget deliberations, including one middle school librarian, one math coach, one middle school adjustment counselor,

88
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:09,297
[SPEAKER_08]: behavior specialist and three full-time kindergarten aides from previously part-time aides at the Robins.

89
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:14,660
[SPEAKER_08]: We were also able to cover both clerical reductions with internal transfers.

90
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:25,187
[SPEAKER_08]: There were multiple changes among paraprofessionals and we're working on a full listing that's still evolving a little bit and we'll provide that to you as soon as we feel comfortable that it's solid.

91
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:33,012
[SPEAKER_08]: School security plans are in place at all schools and principals have been conducting practice drills

92
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:39,296
[SPEAKER_08]: In the first couple of days of school, I visited the schools and walked over to some of them, and everyone was evacuating.

93
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:44,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought maybe school wasn't going to happen, but they were actually practicing.

94
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:52,139
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was no disruption to school operations caused by the September 8, 2016 primary election at five of our school sites.

95
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:01,082
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be closed for the November election, since that's a much heavier election, being a presidential election, and the turnout should be close to 80% versus the 15% or so

96
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:04,910
[SPEAKER_08]: som kommer till primär.

97
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:11,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Transportation routes are going through the typical initial adjustments to reflect actual ridership and route timing.

98
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:14,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Pat is working very hard with the company.

99
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:31,630
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing a good job, again, in making adjustments, trying to make sure that the buses are properly, let's say, filled but not overfilled, and making some adjustments based on changes in individual student situations.

100
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:44,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Initial reports indicate that there's increased ridership around the district, and that we've used the Transfinder system, which we used this year to help smooth out some of these routes.

101
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:55,083
[SPEAKER_08]: We also want to thank the Eastern Bus in Tatiana Hall, who coordinates with Pat on the bus routes for their close work with us.

102
00:12:55,924 --> 00:13:01,229
[SPEAKER_08]: School supplies, as you just heard, and other budget education materials have been ordered and much is in place.

103
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:03,956
[SPEAKER_08]: a few more distributions to take place.

104
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:08,140
[SPEAKER_08]: We're grateful to Team Medford and other groups for their generous support.

105
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,024
[SPEAKER_08]: At our next meeting, we'll recognize other groups who have provided for our students as well.

106
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:17,407
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some nice substantial donations to augment what we have.

107
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:24,333
[SPEAKER_08]: We are implementing our revised supply list plan that reduces individual supply list requests of parents.

108
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:31,118
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, this evening when we were down in the McGlynn, I talked to representatives of the PTO down there and they asked how they could

109
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Provide supplies without hitting parents up.

110
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:43,407
[SPEAKER_08]: And we talked about a methodology for doing that in a more generalized way so that parents, individual parents, don't feel obligated or coerced to providing supplies.

111
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:45,709
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are many parents out there that can't afford it.

112
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:48,671
[SPEAKER_08]: They have multiple children and we want to be fair.

113
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,196
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a new substitute software system, which we call ASOP.

114
00:13:55,156 --> 00:13:55,957
[SPEAKER_08]: It's working well.

115
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:57,198
[SPEAKER_08]: We have

116
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:00,231
[SPEAKER_08]: more substitutes available to us than ever before.

117
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:02,153
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there were like 60 on the list, Pat.

118
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:06,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Previously this time we might have 20, 30 at the most.

119
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:13,942
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is going to be an important year for providing full coverage to our schools.

120
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:24,371
[SPEAKER_08]: We are transmitting, transitioning rather, from our previous student information system, which is I-PASS, to our new system, which is called School Brains.

121
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:28,570
[SPEAKER_08]: It will take some time to work out all the particulars.

122
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Technology glitches are part of what we have to deal with.

123
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:42,797
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a meeting on Wednesday to work out some of the information transfer that we don't think went quite as smoothly as we would have liked it to go.

124
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:48,040
[SPEAKER_08]: But we don't think it's going to, let's say, create any kind of problems down the road.

125
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And as teachers learn to use it, we feel it will reach its optimum utilization.

126
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,748
[SPEAKER_08]: We completed FY 2016 with a balanced budget.

127
00:14:57,508 --> 00:14:59,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Final transactions are being implemented now.

128
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:03,730
[SPEAKER_08]: A report will be forthcoming when all records are reconciled with City Hall.

129
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,551
[SPEAKER_08]: We're entering fiscal 17 in good shape.

130
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:12,952
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to keep an eye on possible state aid reductions in our cost overruns for programs, services, and facilities.

131
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:18,574
[SPEAKER_08]: The state is seeing lower revenues, and who knows, it might trigger 9C cuts.

132
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:22,315
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always out there looming sometime in the late fall.

133
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:27,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Vi har fortfunding som kan tillåts från olika grupper.

134
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:31,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Det är inte klart om legislaturen kommer att förbereda nytta förfunding.

135
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Vi måste också se på alla typer av aktioner i Washington som fortgår i den här tiden.

136
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:40,389
[SPEAKER_08]: I de kommande veckor kommer vi att samarbeta om våra mål och vi fortsätter som vi har progresserat i året.

137
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:41,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Ni har några plattformar.

138
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:42,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Ni kan se dem.

139
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Det är plattformen för utbildning i distrikten.

140
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:55,490
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a chart broken out by actual grades.

141
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,572
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a chart broken out just by school and grade.

142
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:08,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's the elementary class chart that breaks out by teachers and the actual grade levels at each school.

143
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it looks pretty good.

144
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy to take any questions you might have.

145
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:20,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to share, Mr. Superintendent, the class size, the average class size scheduled up as of today?

146
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:21,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

147
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:21,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Or as of Friday?

148
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:22,808
[SPEAKER_08]: As of Friday.

149
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,961
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of today's, we just, we made some adjustments.

150
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:35,267
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had received a couple of calls from Robert's school district, and they were talking about class sizes in the 25 numbers, so I just wanted to just spell this out.

151
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:38,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Kindergarten is the average 21.5, grade 1 16.75, grade 2 22, grade 3 19.8, grade 4 18, and grade 5 18.

152
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:40,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is the average class size as of today.

153
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

154
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:55,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

155
00:16:55,854 --> 00:16:58,817
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was exactly my question, because I've also received calls.

156
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:07,964
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just spoke to Diane about it, and I'd like her to come forward and give a clarification, because I was told that there were classes where there were 25.

157
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:10,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe it was grade two.

158
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:15,469
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I think it was the kindergarten as well, or 24 or something.

159
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,972
[SPEAKER_11]: And it does look, I do have to say, I do have a concern

160
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:31,341
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look at the numbers in kindergarten and look at the numbers in grade one, it looks like the average class size in kindergarten is higher, quite a bit higher than in grade one across the board.

161
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:42,912
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it's always been, particularly in kindergarten, that those were the places where we're looking, you know, for low numbers and in, you know,

162
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:48,090
[SPEAKER_11]: At the Roberts, even with average class size, 21.5, so there's 22 kids in the class.

163
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,951
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a lot of little five-year-olds all together.

164
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:55,092
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am concerned about our kindergarten numbers.

165
00:17:55,912 --> 00:17:59,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Diane, could you address the concern about the numbers at the Roberts specifically?

166
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:01,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I can definitely do that for you.

167
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:09,317
[SPEAKER_13]: So in kindergarten, I guess I can start with the good news is that we have full-time kindergarten aides now at the Roberts Elementary School.

168
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:16,149
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are between 21 and 22 students in each classroom, but at least we have a full-time kindergarten aid.

169
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:27,476
[SPEAKER_13]: With respect to grade two at the Roberts Elementary School, Mr. Johnson, if I can say this, divvies up his classes a little bit differently than the other principals.

170
00:18:28,116 --> 00:18:36,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Most principals will do the average, so if you have 88 students, then each teacher gets about 22 students per classroom.

171
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:51,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Johnson looks at his children and if he feels that there are children with more needs in one classroom, he will say, let me put 19 or 20 in this classroom and bump up another classroom to maybe 24.

172
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:56,045
[SPEAKER_13]: There has never been 25 children in any of the classrooms.

173
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:57,386
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is 24?

174
00:18:58,466 --> 00:18:58,746
[SPEAKER_13]: There is 24.

175
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,488
[SPEAKER_13]: I went down there today specifically and counted grade 2.

176
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:04,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Are the teachers

177
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:24,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they feel that's a very amenable way to divide the children fairly, or is that causing... I mean, I understand, but clearly there were parents who were reacting to it, so I'm somewhat curious about the staff.

178
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:27,257
[SPEAKER_13]: The staff has never complained to me.

179
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:34,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Johnson's been doing this for years, so I haven't had any teacher come to me and say that they think it's unfair.

180
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,362
[SPEAKER_13]: I know in the other buildings it's not done in that way, but Mr. Johnson has been doing this for years.

181
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thank you.

182
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,826
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not quite sure what to think yet.

183
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,026
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess part of it depends on

184
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:58,994
[SPEAKER_11]: How many more kids come into the district in those classes?

185
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you been receiving concerns, Diane?

186
00:20:02,997 --> 00:20:06,439
[SPEAKER_13]: I have not received one phone call from anybody yet.

187
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:10,602
[SPEAKER_13]: And obviously I welcome them because they will call me.

188
00:20:11,102 --> 00:20:14,645
[SPEAKER_13]: But today when I was down at the Roberts School, there was one classroom with 24 students.

189
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:17,447
[SPEAKER_13]: One with 19, one with 20, and one with 21.

190
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:28,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes at this time of the school year, there are no-shows, children transfer out that we are unaware of, so that could still be happening.

191
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,523
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're just waiting for the dust to settle right now.

192
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:36,347
[SPEAKER_13]: But there was one classroom with 24, but the others had 19, 20, and 21 today.

193
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:37,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

194
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:39,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

195
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

196
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:41,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

197
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,052
[SPEAKER_05]: DiVenedetto.

198
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:42,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

199
00:20:44,656 --> 00:21:00,461
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is, students that leave the classroom, is there any additional children on top of the 20, 21, 24 coming into the classroom for other subject matters, or is that the maximum that's in that classroom at any time during the day?

200
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,081
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I'm not sure.

201
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:04,602
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have the answer to that question, but I can find out for you.

202
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:06,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me answer it, because I know what you're asking.

203
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:14,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Those classrooms are for integration of special needs youngsters, and that might happen in a gymnasium, that might happen in an art class,

204
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,644
[SPEAKER_08]: It may happen in some other, let's say, elective type class, but not in the regular classroom.

205
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:33,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Could it happen like if a child that has special needs though comes in for English and math and science, but not English and social studies, so it could bump up those numbers even higher?

206
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:35,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see that at this point in time.

207
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:40,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally, the classes down there, if they've got inclusion, they're part of the original count.

208
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:42,282
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the ESL students?

209
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:42,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing.

210
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Så det är inte... De kan samlas för en generell aktivitet, men inte generellt för reglerna.

211
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:47,172
[SPEAKER_08]: När de samlas, kommer andra lärarna med?

212
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:47,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Ja, de kommer med.

213
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:49,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Även med full-time-aids, i kindergården, tror jag att det är fortfarande högt.

214
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:54,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Vi använder full-time-aids baserat på de antal vi har, inte på de större antal.

215
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:13,459
[SPEAKER_06]: This is still concerning.

216
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:21,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's better because we do have the full-time aides, but the full-time aides were to help the number we already had in existence.

217
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:25,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And kindergartners need a lot of extra time and help from adults.

218
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just putting it out there.

219
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:30,631
[SPEAKER_08]: So I feel obligated to say this.

220
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,332
[SPEAKER_08]: We're spoiled in Medford.

221
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:34,393
[SPEAKER_08]: We are spoiled in Medford.

222
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:36,575
[SPEAKER_08]: You should see the class sizes around the Commonwealth.

223
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:38,656
[SPEAKER_08]: We are spoiled in Medford.

224
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:40,978
[SPEAKER_08]: We are so used to having low class sizes.

225
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,913
[SPEAKER_08]: that any time it peaks a little bit higher, it becomes a major issue in some people's minds.

226
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:51,417
[SPEAKER_08]: These are very good class sizes for public school.

227
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:55,299
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you look around the Commonwealth, you won't find better.

228
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:06,507
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know we'd like to have less, but an additional teacher with benefits and everything is gonna cost you in a classroom, cost you another $100,000 for one or two students.

229
00:23:07,828 --> 00:23:11,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we can adjust the actual instruction

230
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:17,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I can ask the principal to carefully review from time to time whether the 24-21 makes a lot of sense.

231
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,970
[SPEAKER_08]: If it really becomes an issue, maybe we can talk about an aid.

232
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:29,754
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think we should be in the business of just simply adding teachers and adding classrooms when we're at this level.

233
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:37,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easy to make the argument, but I can tell you that our class sizes are among the best in the Commonwealth, much better than our neighbors.

234
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:40,409
[SPEAKER_06]: One more question, please.

235
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:42,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I'm looking at the middle school as well.

236
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:48,495
[SPEAKER_06]: The Andrews has a sixth grade entrance of 178, and the McGlen has 148.

237
00:23:49,296 --> 00:24:05,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we had a big difference at the beginning of sixth grade last year, and that looks more even now as I look at the seventh grade numbers, but there's 30 more children at one than the other.

238
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:08,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought we were hoping to keep them somewhat equal.

239
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:21,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, remember, some of these are a function of youngsters who do have a need to be in certain schools because of certain, let's say, programs that are at that school, as opposed to others.

240
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:27,984
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, clearly they're close enough, you know, for us to do it, and it's certainly well within the class size limits.

241
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:34,469
[SPEAKER_08]: In each grade level, 25 students in a class would be 200 students.

242
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,332
[SPEAKER_08]: If you had 25 students in a class, you'd have 200 students in that grade level.

243
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:47,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Så du har åtta klasser i varje skola, som är delade i det numret, och det visar dig hur stor klassen är.

244
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:53,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Dessutom har du några specifikeringsproblem, som kan ta den numren ännu mindre.

245
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:56,475
[SPEAKER_08]: De klasserna är väldigt bra.

246
00:24:59,756 --> 00:25:02,977
[SPEAKER_06]: –Jag vill, men jag vill vara försiktig, så att vi inte gå ner i vägen

247
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,620
[SPEAKER_08]: that, you know, every time someone says, well, it's a little too high, that we start saying, okay, add a teacher.

248
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,181
[SPEAKER_08]: That takes away from other things.

249
00:25:15,863 --> 00:25:20,405
[SPEAKER_03]: To still go back, I might need Ms.

250
00:25:20,525 --> 00:25:22,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Caldwell to come back up, if she doesn't mind.

251
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:29,810
[SPEAKER_03]: You keep on saying, or you've kept on saying, that the other schools actually do it in a different manner.

252
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,271
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.

253
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:34,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I guess my question is that,

254
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:51,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't want to dictate the principles of the school, but if this might be an issue that is occurring and it might occur again, and it has been something that people have been worried about, why doesn't he do it like the other schools?

255
00:25:52,378 --> 00:25:54,799
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish I had an easy answer to that, Anne-Marie.

256
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,721
[SPEAKER_13]: The other schools equitably distribute the children if it was 22 per school.

257
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:08,787
[SPEAKER_13]: And you have children who are ELL or SEI children, or you have special needs children, and we have push-in with some students.

258
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:13,692
[SPEAKER_13]: They distribute them equitably among the four classrooms.

259
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:20,200
[SPEAKER_13]: The superintendent and I have had conversations before, but Mr. Johnson feels that this method

260
00:26:20,968 --> 00:26:22,530
[SPEAKER_13]: best for him in his building.

261
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:32,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my concern is that now for putting, let's say, all the children with special needs into one classroom, that's a lot for that teacher to be handling.

262
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:37,666
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that, you know, it contributes to everything.

263
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:38,967
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a domino effect.

264
00:26:39,507 --> 00:26:43,812
[SPEAKER_03]: My concern is now, you know, one, is it fair to that teacher?

265
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:46,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he change the teachers around each year?

266
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:48,367
[SPEAKER_13]: So I believe he does do that.

267
00:26:48,947 --> 00:27:00,671
[SPEAKER_13]: So he probably has two classrooms that may have lower numbers, and those might be what he would call his inclusion classrooms, although we all know we have children with needs in all classrooms.

268
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:11,355
[SPEAKER_13]: So he may put more students with special needs or ELL needs in two out of four of the classrooms, and he does change them every year.

269
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:15,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that I think we really need to look at.

270
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:23,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we don't want to sit here and dictate what the principals are doing in their own schools, but we do have the right to start questioning this.

271
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And this isn't the right, I don't think the way this is done.

272
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,023
[SPEAKER_03]: is probably, you know, thank you, equitable.

273
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:33,264
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a very long day.

274
00:27:33,345 --> 00:27:34,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, guys.

275
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:37,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Equitable, and it just doesn't seem fair to the students.

276
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:46,755
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't seem fair to the teachers, and there's just so much coming on, and I just, I feel bad for that particular teacher, even though he might be changing each and every year.

277
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:49,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a lot on that one particular teacher that particular year.

278
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's something that we really need to look at.

279
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing also is to bring up the middle school.

280
00:27:56,404 --> 00:28:02,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying to change anything around this year, but I have looked at the numbers and the Andrews has 178, the McGlynn has 148.

281
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that it's because of, you know, certain students have to be at certain schools, but it's a difference of 30 students.

282
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:14,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there was a difference last year also.

283
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, I'm not saying to change anything.

284
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:25,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying on the record, I want to make sure that we're looking at these numbers for even next year, because if this is going to becoming a trend that, you know, it goes from 10

285
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:33,728
[SPEAKER_03]: to 30 and next year might be 50, there might be a reason why so many students now want to go to one school rather than the other.

286
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:47,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we're trying to keep the middle schools especially very similar to each other because eventually all these students, we hope, are going to come up to the high school and we don't want to have any animosity between the two schools.

287
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:51,159
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could just direct a comment to that response.

288
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,461
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe the inequity is basically at grade six.

289
00:28:55,257 --> 00:28:56,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Det är några saker.

290
00:28:56,077 --> 00:28:57,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Först och främst, kan varje gradnivå tillgång till 200 barn.

291
00:28:57,917 --> 00:29:02,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Så det är inte så att Andrews är överkröjt, det är bara att fler personer har optat för att återgå till grad 6.

292
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:04,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Om man tittar på grader 7 och 8, så är de mer tillgängliga.

293
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:08,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Den andra faktorn är att alla våra ELL-studenter återgår till McGlynn.

294
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Så vi måste lämna plats i McGlynn, för de studenter kommer i skolan under året.

295
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Och det är där våra ELL-programmet sitter.

296
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,274
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of kids that come in.

297
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:35,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So we try to, again, keep the numbers lower at the McGlynn to accommodate those ELL students because there are no ELL student transferred and goes to the Inders.

298
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:37,922
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's another factor with that.

299
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:39,504
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a huge factor.

300
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:42,566
[SPEAKER_10]: It is huge and it's very hard to predict.

301
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:53,073
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, right now, I mean, the balance in grades seven and eight is pretty equitable, but I know as I talked to the parent center, I said, when students are coming in now, transfers,

302
00:29:53,974 --> 00:30:02,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Any non-ELL, you have to put in the Andrews, because I need to leave space in the McGlynn for the ELL youngsters who will come in during the year.

303
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:03,685
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can't predict.

304
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,667
[SPEAKER_10]: We might have five, we might have 50.

305
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:07,889
[SPEAKER_10]: If we have 50, it's a problem.

306
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:08,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping not.

307
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to try to go in the past years.

308
00:30:10,872 --> 00:30:15,097
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's probably part of why you're seeing the imbalance in 7th and 8th.

309
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:32,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the transition is on an everyday basis too, but at least if we have another number in a couple of months just to see have we received more children into the McGlynn and how it's looking.

310
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:33,160
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we're asking.

311
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

312
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,024
[SPEAKER_10]: We already, I know last week, I think we had eight or nine youngsters coming in.

313
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:40,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I think all of them were ELL youngsters, so it does

314
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:43,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Ok, that does fluctuate.

315
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:46,303
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd like parents to understand that that's the reason why.

316
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:52,565
[SPEAKER_03]: You just don't want people thinking, oh, everybody's going to one school rather than the other and causing a situation that there isn't.

317
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for the clarification.

318
00:30:56,766 --> 00:31:00,927
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to go back to some of the numbers and if I could ask Diane to come forward again.

319
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:11,690
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Diane, there is a difficulty here because we're sort of seeing numbers and, you know, it's kind of us second-guessing the principles, which we understand the fallacy of that.

320
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:17,578
[SPEAKER_11]: I could probably make a strongest argument supporting the way that Mr. Johnson divvies up kids.

321
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:28,349
[SPEAKER_11]: saying it may be in fact the most equitable way, because we all know that one very difficult student, a teacher might prefer three easy students in comparison.

322
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,731
[SPEAKER_11]: But it does raise some questions.

323
00:31:31,512 --> 00:31:40,739
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the questions I see elsewhere is that at the Columbus on the first grade, we are as class size as low as 14 students, while the kindergarten is up to 21.

324
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:42,180
[SPEAKER_11]: And playing around,

325
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:51,426
[SPEAKER_11]: I almost wondered, gee, would we have better off to have an extra kindergarten teacher and divide it up in a different way.

326
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:54,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm curious why that decision was made.

327
00:31:55,329 --> 00:32:12,460
[SPEAKER_13]: The students grew at the very last minute in the kindergarten for the Columbus School, and then I looked at the grade one numbers at the Columbus, and I checked out the teacher licenses, and I had no teachers here.

328
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:21,728
[SPEAKER_13]: who actually had a kindergarten license, or I might have thought about transferring one of those teachers down to kindergarten in a heartbeat to help the kindergartners.

329
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:41,545
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's sort of, what happens is we get a flow of children for registration, and so we base our teacher numbers based on what we have, and then, I don't know, the superintendent can tell you as well, last week and the week before, we got a rush of numbers which increased at the Columbus School in the kindergarten.

330
00:32:43,153 --> 00:32:46,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Do all of those teachers at the Columbus School have full-time aides?

331
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:48,175
[SPEAKER_13]: They do not.

332
00:32:48,655 --> 00:32:52,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Three out of four have full-time aides in the kindergarten, yes, not all of them.

333
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:53,437
[SPEAKER_11]: So three out of four.

334
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:56,078
[SPEAKER_11]: And does the fourth teacher have the same 21 kids?

335
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, she does.

336
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:06,663
[SPEAKER_13]: But what they do is they share an aide off and on so that at times she does have a full-time aide.

337
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:10,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, again, looking at the number, I think that that's where we might be saying, hey,

338
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand the superintendent saying, look, you know,

339
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:35,120
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got great class sizes, and I've certainly spoken to other people in other towns, and I know we have great class sizes, but still, my expectation was more that they're in the 17-18 range.

340
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,542
[SPEAKER_11]: When I see going up to 22, that's definitely concerning to me.

341
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:51,766
[SPEAKER_11]: In the Roberts School, one of the things I want to ask you about the kindergarten class specifically, since the principal told us that, you know, are there any kindergarten classrooms with 24 or 25?

342
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:53,627
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

343
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:54,328
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.

344
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:56,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so they're divided equitably?

345
00:33:57,631 --> 00:33:57,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

346
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:03,235
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, the rest of the classes, I think, are the same.

347
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:07,358
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have 24 in any other classroom at the Roberts Elementary.

348
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:09,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

349
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

350
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:10,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

351
00:34:12,122 --> 00:34:20,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, if I look at this sheet at the second grade, it says average class size 22, but you've told me that there's some with 24.

352
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,670
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I look at kindergarten,

353
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,058
[SPEAKER_11]: It says average class size 21.5, i.e.

354
00:34:25,078 --> 00:34:25,058
22.

355
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,979
[SPEAKER_11]: So would one kindergarten class have 20 and the other have 24?

356
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:29,439
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

357
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:30,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

358
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:32,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

359
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you want to finance kindergarten aids, I'd be happy to take that.

360
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:36,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

361
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:50,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I really think that looking at the numbers, we might look at how that Columbus, that one class which doesn't have a kindergarten aid in equity seems like a need there.

362
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:50,904
[SPEAKER_11]: At the Columbus School, you mean?

363
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:51,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

364
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

365
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:54,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy to help.

366
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:56,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Ms.

367
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:56,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Caldwell.

368
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:05,949
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to clarify my experience at the Roberts with Mr. Johnson, who now I have two who are on to the middle school, three who are still there, one to soon be there.

369
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,913
[SPEAKER_12]: We've always had wonderful class sizes, wonderful teachers.

370
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:17,538
[SPEAKER_12]: My children have had the same teacher different years, and sometimes that teacher was the inclusion class,

371
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Other years they were not.

372
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,432
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do think there is a method to his madness.

373
00:35:21,672 --> 00:35:23,293
[SPEAKER_12]: I trust him and his judgment.

374
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:30,798
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think before we dictate anything to him, I think it'd be fair for him to come here if we have more questions directly for him.

375
00:35:30,938 --> 00:35:36,302
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just, I really am a strong supporter of Mr. Johnson, and I just want to give those words.

376
00:35:36,322 --> 00:35:36,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

377
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:38,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

378
00:35:39,244 --> 00:35:39,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

379
00:35:39,444 --> 00:35:39,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Kurtz?

380
00:35:40,284 --> 00:35:40,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hi.

381
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:44,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to mention I was looking at the numbers.

382
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:46,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the numbers from last year on my phone.

383
00:35:47,496 --> 00:35:52,079
[SPEAKER_01]: The Columbus did have the average class size for kindergarten was 17.

384
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,342
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a jump for the Columbus School in the kindergarten.

385
00:35:56,663 --> 00:36:00,566
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that would be four students, you know, average per kindergarten class.

386
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:02,027
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a jump.

387
00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:06,250
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was the significant jump in all of the different elementary schools.

388
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,211
[SPEAKER_01]: The other schools stayed the same.

389
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:12,714
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like the population is growing in the Columbus area, you know, for kindergarten.

390
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:16,197
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with Paulette that I think we need to kind of

391
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:19,998
[SPEAKER_01]: take a look at it and make sure that the teachers are okay.

392
00:36:20,018 --> 00:36:24,462
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they need any aids, because that would be a four students in kindergarten.

393
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:25,142
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.

394
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:25,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

395
00:36:26,223 --> 00:36:34,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the, I did look at the other numbers in the middle school, um, was comparably very much the same as last year.

396
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:37,591
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it was like significant jump, but not a lot.

397
00:36:38,452 --> 00:36:38,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

398
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:39,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

399
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:40,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

400
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:41,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Scary.

401
00:36:41,614 --> 00:36:43,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to put an information through you to miss Colville.

402
00:36:44,316 --> 00:36:45,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, how many parents requested, uh,

403
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Not their school they were assigned to, but to go to another school.

404
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,161
[SPEAKER_15]: for the kindergarten, and how many of those requests were on it?

405
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:57,583
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have the numbers on me right now, but I can certainly get those for you.

406
00:36:57,603 --> 00:36:57,963
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate that.

407
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:07,248
[SPEAKER_13]: But honestly, this year, because it was so equitable across with our numbers, I couldn't make any transfers.

408
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:19,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it's possible for me if I have one school that only has maybe 17 children, and I sort of at another school have an overload, that I can make transfers to that school.

409
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:23,789
[SPEAKER_13]: But this year it was pretty equitable across with like 21, 22 students.

410
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,331
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm happy to see that the Columbus School is growing, actually.

411
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:28,551
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a great school.

412
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:29,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

413
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:30,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

414
00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:30,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

415
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:31,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Vanden Heuvel?

416
00:37:31,472 --> 00:37:32,012
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's okay.

417
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:32,772
[SPEAKER_11]: You're all set?

418
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:33,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

419
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:40,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion on the floor to proceed with the press on file?

420
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:41,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

421
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:41,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Ms.

422
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:42,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanden Heuvel.

423
00:37:42,236 --> 00:37:42,916
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

424
00:37:43,236 --> 00:37:43,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

425
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:44,596
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

426
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:46,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Papers placed on file.

427
00:37:48,687 --> 00:37:51,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on Administrative Meetings and Teacher Induction Week.

428
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:52,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

429
00:37:53,270 --> 00:38:01,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Mayor, Members of the Committee, our Deputy Superintendent will bring you up to date on the Administrative Meetings and also our Teacher Induction Program.

430
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:03,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

431
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:16,963
[SPEAKER_10]: The week of August 22nd to 26th was extremely busy for both administrators and for our new teachers as both groups had a variety of activities going on with different meetings and trainings.

432
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll start with the new teacher induction program.

433
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:26,613
[SPEAKER_10]: This used to be a one-day program, but over the years, we expanded to two days and three days, and now it's four.

434
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:38,816
[SPEAKER_10]: There are just so many things that we feel that our new teachers should know about, the district and programs that they should know about before they enter the buildings day one, so we do have a pretty expansive program.

435
00:38:40,156 --> 00:38:43,357
[SPEAKER_10]: We have two wonderful mentor coordinators.

436
00:38:43,557 --> 00:38:45,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Our mentor program has been in existence for many years.

437
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:53,566
[SPEAKER_10]: The coordinators this year are teachers Jody Lu from the high school and Donna Lasky from the McGlynn Elementary.

438
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:59,711
[SPEAKER_10]: And they help myself, Diane, and Bernadette Riccadeli plan all of the activities for the four days.

439
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:05,855
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have a lot of our administrators stepping up to the plate and, you know, presenting different workshops.

440
00:39:05,915 --> 00:39:12,020
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Dr. Riccadeli and Mr. DeLaver did a wonderful workshop on the educator evaluation system.

441
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:14,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio

442
00:39:15,295 --> 00:39:20,696
[SPEAKER_10]: did a wonderful presentation on professionalism, which was well received by the teachers.

443
00:39:21,297 --> 00:39:26,778
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, the four days give our teachers a great opportunity to know our people and programs.

444
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:35,341
[SPEAKER_10]: The teachers were very pleased when Mayor Burke showed up on one of our days and had a photograph opportunity with the group.

445
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:44,163
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to kind of give you an idea of how you have the agenda for the four days, but how it was received, Dr. Riccadeli did

446
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:55,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I collect and collate the valuations of the week by the new teachers, and I've included those under new teacher reflections.

447
00:39:56,386 --> 00:40:03,487
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can see, day by day, we did the first day do a complete workshop day on technology.

448
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:10,629
[SPEAKER_10]: All of our teachers, our new teachers received iPads, and you can see that they were very appreciative of that and the training.

449
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:21,376
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see that on the other days, they enjoyed learning, meeting department heads, putting names and faces together, which we feel are very important.

450
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:26,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So if something comes up with special education, they see Kathy Medaglia's name, they've met her.

451
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:29,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's important for our new staff.

452
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:34,947
[SPEAKER_10]: They also felt it was a great time to meet other new teachers, to network.

453
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:40,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Other remarks, it was warm, reassuring, and welcoming, which makes us happy that

454
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:42,728
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're doing something right with this.

455
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:48,132
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to kind of, you can kind of read through this, a whole lot of different comments.

456
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:59,041
[SPEAKER_10]: The last day, we focus on school culture and professionalism and the social emotional initiative that our district is so, you know, dedicated to.

457
00:40:59,962 --> 00:41:07,608
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can see from the remarks, I learned a lot of valuable tips and lessons pertaining to professional dress for success.

458
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:10,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a great closing day.

459
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:17,880
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, this person left feeling confident and encouraged.

460
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,921
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's what we wanted people to feel by the time they walked out the door on Friday.

461
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:26,042
[SPEAKER_10]: So it really was, I think, a very successful week for our new teachers.

462
00:41:26,822 --> 00:41:34,604
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as the administrators, we split the week up between allowing administrators to do their own thing in their own buildings and departments.

463
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:37,125
[SPEAKER_10]: We did have two full days of meetings.

464
00:41:37,585 --> 00:41:38,865
[SPEAKER_10]: There are many things that

465
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,192
[SPEAKER_10]: The administrators, we wanted to get them up to speed on.

466
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:45,534
[SPEAKER_10]: There were several legal issues.

467
00:41:45,994 --> 00:41:54,600
[SPEAKER_10]: We had some training on ASOP, which is our new substitute teacher system that the district is currently using.

468
00:41:55,881 --> 00:42:04,767
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, we basically spoke with them about the programs that took place during the summer, and I'll be talking about those a little later on this evening.

469
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:21,263
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of time and effort is put into planning these days by everyone, and I think that we feel that the planning time is well spent, and it helped to ensure a smooth opening of school for our teachers on August 29th.

470
00:42:21,763 --> 00:42:29,626
[SPEAKER_10]: And we thank all the teachers, the administrators, and the consultants who took a part in making the week so successful.

471
00:42:31,286 --> 00:42:32,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions, comments?

472
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

473
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:38,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, motion on the floor to receive and place on file, seconded by Ms.

474
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:38,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Kretz.

475
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:39,444
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

476
00:42:40,545 --> 00:42:41,225
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

477
00:42:41,465 --> 00:42:42,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

478
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:46,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on new state curriculum frameworks for science education.

479
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:55,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, our Director of Science, Rocco Sierra, is here to brief you on that.

480
00:42:56,155 --> 00:43:03,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to show you the booklet that contains the standards that everyone's supposed to learn.

481
00:43:03,853 --> 00:43:07,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll make sure you get a copy so you can study them on your own in your own leisure.

482
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:10,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, Rocco will tell you all about it.

483
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:14,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and school committee members.

484
00:43:15,978 --> 00:43:23,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Before you, you have the report for the new curriculum framework for science and technology engineering.

485
00:43:24,582 --> 00:43:32,825
[SPEAKER_09]: The Massachusetts Board of Education approved a new science and technology engineering framework and made the publication available in April.

486
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:50,762
[SPEAKER_09]: This framework replaces the 2006 Massachusetts framework, STE framework, and articulates some statewide guidelines for science, technology, engineering, learning, teaching, and assessment for the Commonwealth's public schools.

487
00:43:52,783 --> 00:44:03,185
[SPEAKER_09]: The 2016 STE standards, and I'm just going to use the shorthand because it comes up quite a bit in the report, maintain a lot of the content of the prior standards.

488
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:22,375
[SPEAKER_09]: men there have been some changes over the past 15 years and there have been some really important things that we've learned about engaging students in STE disciplines for academic programs as well as civic life and their post-secondary opportunities.

489
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:27,037
[SPEAKER_09]: The following changes, I've broken them up by grade level.

490
00:44:28,997 --> 00:44:33,939
[SPEAKER_09]: The first thing that has changed is that the standards integrate

491
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:38,342
[SPEAKER_09]: disciplinary core ideas, and science and engineering practices.

492
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:55,948
[SPEAKER_09]: These were two separate kinds of things, and if you look through the standards and compared the two documents, you would notice that the standard itself is written as though there's already an embedded sort of hands-on component into it, whereas the older standards did not have that.

493
00:44:58,008 --> 00:44:59,489
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, there's another change.

494
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:02,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Beginning in pre-K and continuing through grade 8,

495
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,202
[SPEAKER_09]: standards are divided by grade level rather than grade band.

496
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:23,030
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a pretty significant change, considering that when we try to coordinate our content instruction from grade to grade, there may be a tendency to teach some of the standards at different, you know, repeated standards.

497
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:30,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So this should alleviate some of that and allow for teachers in any district to be able to teach very specific standards.

498
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:37,500
[SPEAKER_09]: There are also changes which will require district-wide curriculum alignment.

499
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:46,903
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, the new framework adds 15 standards to pre-K to 2nd grade and 14 standards to the 3rd through 5th grade level.

500
00:45:47,643 --> 00:45:52,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas at the 6th through 8th grade level, there's actually a net loss of two standards.

501
00:45:53,984 --> 00:46:00,006
[SPEAKER_09]: While there is some removal and reworking of these standards, there's a net gain of standards at the elementary and middle school level.

502
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:04,258
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's sort of significant because it goes along with what I would like to speak about later on.

503
00:46:05,018 --> 00:46:08,719
[SPEAKER_09]: At the high school level, it generally remains the same.

504
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:16,963
[SPEAKER_09]: It's subject-specific courses in biology, introductory physics, chemistry, earth and space sciences, and technology engineering.

505
00:46:17,563 --> 00:46:24,286
[SPEAKER_09]: And currently, our current resources can be very well adapted to meet those standards.

506
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:26,287
[SPEAKER_09]: The MCAS.

507
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:32,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Students will continue to be assessed using MCAS in grades 5, 8, and in high school.

508
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:41,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Beginning in 2017, the grade 5 and grade 8 science MCAS will pilot some new questions that reflect the standard.

509
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:50,386
[SPEAKER_09]: At the high school level, the subject-specific MCAS will continue using the old frameworks at least until 2019.

510
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:03,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Not sure if it's squeaking because of where I'm standing, or if it's the mic, I apologize for that.

511
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:15,465
[SPEAKER_09]: For our district-wide curriculum, the report breaks it up from elementary and middle school, and then at the high school level.

512
00:47:16,265 --> 00:47:19,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford's curriculum resources require some updating.

513
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,847
[SPEAKER_09]: primarily at the elementary and middle school level.

514
00:47:22,487 --> 00:47:24,408
[SPEAKER_09]: The area of most need is the K-5.

515
00:47:25,688 --> 00:47:42,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Over the past two years, we anticipated addressing some of the engineering practices by purchasing two units from a highly rated program entitled Engineering is Elementary, and this was designed at the Museum of Science in Boston through the Center for Technological Literacy.

516
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,795
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee also allocated an additional $10,000 in this year's budget

517
00:47:50,348 --> 00:47:54,229
[SPEAKER_09]: at the elementary school level.

518
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:58,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is reflected in the instructional science supplies budget line item.

519
00:47:58,831 --> 00:48:10,594
[SPEAKER_09]: At the same time, we're going to need to identify some new resources to address the disciplinary standards described in the 2016 STE framework that I've sort of outlined at the beginning of the report.

520
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:17,956
[SPEAKER_09]: At the middle school, students will require new textbooks as the current texts are outdated and don't reflect the

521
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,858
[SPEAKER_09]: requirements of the new frameworks.

522
00:48:20,758 --> 00:48:27,741
[SPEAKER_09]: During the school year, myself and Dr. Riccadeli, the Director of Curriculum Instruction, will oversee a curriculum committee.

523
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:36,645
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll meet to identify, review, pilot textbook programs that align with the new frameworks and make some recommendations in the upcoming years.

524
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:47,409
[SPEAKER_09]: At the high school level, we've gained quite a bit from the current programming and facilities at Medford High School and the Vocational Technical High School.

525
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:57,079
[SPEAKER_09]: City of Medford successfully funded the Science Lab Initiative, which allowed the 17 state-of-the-art labs in the facility.

526
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:04,264
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the high school, the curriculum is poised to maximize student learning in line with the 2016 STE frameworks.

527
00:49:05,044 --> 00:49:11,568
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a need to update high school chemistry and biology textbooks, and that can come in the coming years.

528
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:17,032
[SPEAKER_09]: The framework isn't changing, so we can still wait on those materials.

529
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:23,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice-chancellor, our approach should be multi-year, involving school community, families, and educators.

530
00:49:23,955 --> 00:49:41,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And beginning this year, we will form that curriculum committee to review the details of the framework that you have in front of you, identify some content gaps that are in our current district-wide curriculum, priority concerns, and begin the process of reviewing resources to recommend to you.

531
00:49:42,403 --> 00:49:44,764
[SPEAKER_09]: It's clear that the elementary and middle school level, however,

532
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:50,826
[SPEAKER_09]: will need to be a priority in the current and upcoming school budget so that the curriculum programs at that level can be adopted.

533
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:52,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

534
00:49:52,807 --> 00:49:53,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any questions?

535
00:49:55,328 --> 00:49:55,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

536
00:49:55,528 --> 00:49:56,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Mestone?

537
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:56,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

538
00:49:56,889 --> 00:49:57,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Mestone?

539
00:49:57,249 --> 00:49:57,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

540
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for all this information.

541
00:50:00,091 --> 00:50:06,834
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we've spoken in the past that that's been a concern for parents at the Roberts and other elementary schools that the books are from 1997.

542
00:50:08,095 --> 00:50:11,957
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing that struck me is that it says the MCAS this spring

543
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,261
[SPEAKER_12]: for grades five and eight will include the new state standards.

544
00:50:15,522 --> 00:50:20,286
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll pilot some questions, but those questions won't be reflected in the student scores.

545
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:21,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

546
00:50:21,707 --> 00:50:24,029
[SPEAKER_09]: We're too early in the process for them to roll them out.

547
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:32,896
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when you talk about upcoming years and a multi-year endeavor, when do you think actual new textbooks will be rolled out in the elementary schools?

548
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:35,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because parents constantly ask about science curriculum.

549
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:36,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

550
00:50:36,459 --> 00:50:40,823
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to form the committee, hopefully pilot some materials as early as possible.

551
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:44,267
[SPEAKER_09]: och när budget kan stödjer det så kan vi rullar ut det.

552
00:50:44,748 --> 00:50:45,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Jag kan inte tala om det.

553
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:48,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Det kommer att vända sig till kommittén själva att besluta på det.

554
00:50:49,051 --> 00:50:59,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Så om du minns från våra budgetdeliberationer, vi kommer att bli klar med att betala för InVision i det här året, och sen det pengar kommer att flytta över till Science at the elementary level.

555
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Riktigt, så kan vi vänta till september för ny science?

556
00:51:03,003 --> 00:51:07,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Vi vill se på nästa året om vi kan lägga pengar in i curriculum science elementary.

557
00:51:09,956 --> 00:51:13,058
[SPEAKER_08]: envision which will be over.

558
00:51:13,578 --> 00:51:14,379
[SPEAKER_12]: So September of 2017.

559
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:15,280
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, great.

560
00:51:19,123 --> 00:51:19,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect.

561
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:20,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

562
00:51:22,465 --> 00:51:27,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there's a motion to receive in place on file by Mr. Scary, seconded by Miss Van de Kloot.

563
00:51:27,189 --> 00:51:27,930
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

564
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,953
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed motion passes a question on that paper.

565
00:51:33,846 --> 00:51:35,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

566
00:51:35,908 --> 00:51:40,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say we added a lot of new technology and labs at our high school.

567
00:51:41,154 --> 00:51:44,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have enough equipment and materials?

568
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:48,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know the materials go quickly in those labs.

569
00:51:48,782 --> 00:51:52,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure that they have the actual enough supplies.

570
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:58,043
[SPEAKER_09]: So our curriculum supplies are supported by the current budget.

571
00:51:59,003 --> 00:52:04,265
[SPEAKER_09]: We replace anything that's consumable, and then we have some materials that last for many years.

572
00:52:06,365 --> 00:52:13,227
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, if we take the freshman introductory physics, those materials are durable and last for many years.

573
00:52:13,627 --> 00:52:18,828
[SPEAKER_09]: The things that need replacing are maybe batteries and wires and some of the materials that go along with it.

574
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:25,694
[SPEAKER_09]: och vi har kontinuerligt anpassat det med konsumable material supply budget line item som skolanskommunikation förbjuder.

575
00:52:26,115 --> 00:52:37,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Så vi är ganska up to date på det, och vi har också tillräcklig tillgång till att få studenter och klasser att jobba i grupper av två eller tre, aldrig mer än det, i nästan alla kurser som vi lär oss.

576
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:39,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Vi har också fått en hel del andra hjälp genom granter.

577
00:52:39,966 --> 00:52:41,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Vi har fått granter från Bioteach,

578
00:52:48,113 --> 00:52:59,278
[SPEAKER_09]: The Massachusetts Life Sciences Group, and additional things which have supported the budget in quite a significant way.

579
00:52:59,378 --> 00:53:08,582
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do make up for a lot through grants and things, and there's a lot of materials available for teachers to use.

580
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:09,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

581
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:11,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in the chemistry classes and all chemistry?

582
00:53:12,008 --> 00:53:16,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we've always replaced anything that breaks any chemicals.

583
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:19,949
[SPEAKER_09]: We keep control of inventory there.

584
00:53:20,049 --> 00:53:23,830
[SPEAKER_09]: So all of those things are really pretty well maintained.

585
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

586
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:26,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

587
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on the before school program.

588
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:35,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, our assistant superintendent will tell us about before school.

589
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:38,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening again.

590
00:53:39,388 --> 00:53:46,974
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are very proud to say that the Medford Public Schools B4 School Program has been up and running since the very first day of school.

591
00:53:47,755 --> 00:53:57,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Informational letters and packets were sent out backpack express in June to our families and all of our information was posted on our Medford website.

592
00:53:58,864 --> 00:54:13,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Each before school staff member is provided with an attendance sheet, list of staff contacts, completed health forms for children with known allergies or health concerns, and some emergency contact information, which is very important.

593
00:54:14,772 --> 00:54:26,658
[SPEAKER_13]: We work closely with Tony Vento, who is our supervisor of nurses, to collect our documents, provide us with EpiPens, and hopefully we're going to have a CPR and first aid class

594
00:54:27,186 --> 00:54:28,347
[SPEAKER_13]: for our teachers.

595
00:54:29,428 --> 00:54:34,612
[SPEAKER_13]: As we did last year, we met with the before school staff in June and in August.

596
00:54:35,213 --> 00:54:39,737
[SPEAKER_13]: This past June we wanted to evaluate the program because it was our first year.

597
00:54:40,737 --> 00:54:50,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Our teachers were very happy with it, we got positive feedback from our parents, and our students were happy with the activities that were provided to them.

598
00:54:51,779 --> 00:55:00,464
[SPEAKER_13]: We have given each elementary school a cell phone and they also have a website that you can go to to place absences.

599
00:55:00,484 --> 00:55:05,607
[SPEAKER_13]: I've provided you with materials that are attached.

600
00:55:06,677 --> 00:55:10,818
[SPEAKER_13]: For the most part, I'm happy to say that our numbers have grown a little bit.

601
00:55:11,638 --> 00:55:23,601
[SPEAKER_13]: The Brooks is at 45 last year and 45 this year, although I must say I have about five to seven students on a waiting list there, and I just need to check with the staff to make sure that they can fold them in without any problems.

602
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:27,101
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would give us 52 students at the Brooks School.

603
00:55:27,941 --> 00:55:30,862
[SPEAKER_13]: The Columbus grew from 12 to 18 this year.

604
00:55:30,882 --> 00:55:35,363
[SPEAKER_13]: The McGlynn started at 12 last year, but I actually think the number is

605
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:40,800
[SPEAKER_13]: 13 this year because we have a few more students added since I did this.

606
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:45,362
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Roberts has grown from 10 to 18 students this year.

607
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:50,225
[SPEAKER_13]: The before school staff arrive at their locations at 7.25.

608
00:55:50,705 --> 00:55:55,967
[SPEAKER_13]: The children play, read, complete art projects, or talk to the teachers.

609
00:55:57,108 --> 00:56:00,990
[SPEAKER_13]: And then at 8.15, the students go to the cafeteria where they have breakfast.

610
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:08,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Feedback I received from parents is that they're very happy that they have a place to drop their children off, where they know they're safe.

611
00:56:10,212 --> 00:56:15,673
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Michelle Bissell, who goes above and beyond for me on a regular basis.

612
00:56:16,613 --> 00:56:18,994
[SPEAKER_13]: She works tirelessly on this program.

613
00:56:19,054 --> 00:56:31,117
[SPEAKER_13]: She explains to parents the fax payment system, collects health care information that will go on to our lead teachers, and orders any needed materials for our before school staff.

614
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:39,808
[SPEAKER_13]: We give each program $50 for whatever supplies they need and we order the supplies for them.

615
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:47,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, my thanks go out to the superintendent who has always been very supportive of this program and to you for your continued support.

616
00:56:47,844 --> 00:57:10,173
[SPEAKER_13]: So the information that's in your packet is a letter that we sent home to our parents explaining the fax system, the registration form that is online as well as sent home, Backpack Express, and another registration form, the parent handbook, and at the very end, I believe you have a list of the before school

617
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:12,670
[SPEAKER_13]: program contact information.

618
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,951
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be happy to answer any questions.

619
00:57:18,472 --> 00:57:18,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

620
00:57:18,932 --> 00:57:21,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second on that?

621
00:57:21,773 --> 00:57:23,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to speak, Mr. Benedetto?

622
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:23,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

623
00:57:24,895 --> 00:57:25,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

624
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Diane, I just have a few questions.

625
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:38,800
[SPEAKER_06]: My first idea was to ask Carmack Health if they'd come down and train both the before school and after school CPR and first aid, since it's so generous with us in every other way.

626
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:47,365
[SPEAKER_06]: and they just declared this evening how they wanna be a big part of the community, that that's a good way to get our people trained.

627
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, that's a great idea, thank you.

628
00:57:49,947 --> 00:57:54,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, my other question was about a wait list, so thank you for filling in that information.

629
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:58,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this program self-subsidized?

630
00:58:00,194 --> 00:58:01,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it pay for itself?

631
00:58:01,575 --> 00:58:03,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It does pay for itself, yes.

632
00:58:03,256 --> 00:58:04,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it generate an income?

633
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:07,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

634
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:08,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It does?

635
00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:19,427
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, we need to keep it for situations where there may be a shortfall, someone doesn't, or can't pay at some point in time, there may be some scholarships that are generated because of low income.

636
00:58:19,607 --> 00:58:20,847
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my next question.

637
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:27,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever's left over is figured into our overall revenue plan, because obviously we have to offset our budget with revenue, as you know.

638
00:58:28,049 --> 00:58:30,230
[SPEAKER_13]: We do scholarship some children in.

639
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:36,452
[SPEAKER_13]: I received scholarship applications from a few families across the board.

640
00:58:38,195 --> 00:58:39,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I also had another question.

641
00:58:39,597 --> 00:58:44,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we noticing any parents that are dropping children off early but not enrolling them in the program?

642
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:49,745
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's interesting that you ask that question because the answer is yes, specifically at the McGlynn School.

643
00:58:50,586 --> 00:59:06,459
[SPEAKER_13]: So I find that parents who have children at the middle school will sometimes drop their elementary off at the same time and it becomes a safety issue for us really because they want the children, sometimes they tell them just to sit on the side, which I want them in the building.

644
00:59:07,204 --> 00:59:10,647
[SPEAKER_13]: and usually they get forwarded to the office area.

645
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:12,529
[SPEAKER_13]: So one day I was over with Ms.

646
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:18,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Guarino and I said, there were like four children, four or five children, and she said, yeah, the parents dropped them off.

647
00:59:18,194 --> 00:59:28,623
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've asked her to contact the parents to say that they cannot do that, but if in fact that they need some help with scholarships, we're happy to do that for them.

648
00:59:28,643 --> 00:59:34,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's really my major concern and that's why I asked about whether there's income and space

649
00:59:34,477 --> 00:59:37,059
[SPEAKER_06]: for those parents and if we were reaching out to them.

650
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:48,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, you know, as the darkness gets darker earlier in the morning, my concern is that and as it gets colder, I just don't want children waiting outside of any school.

651
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:53,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really glad that these programs are run and that there are adults there that are aware of that.

652
00:59:53,889 --> 00:59:54,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great.

653
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the information is great and how you roll it out.

654
00:59:58,192 --> 01:00:02,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate this program and what it's doing for our community.

655
01:00:03,135 --> 01:00:03,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

656
01:00:03,936 --> 01:00:04,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

657
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:05,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

658
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:08,806
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion to receive and place on file, seconded by Ms.

659
01:00:08,826 --> 01:00:09,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Vandekloot.

660
01:00:09,527 --> 01:00:10,307
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

661
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:11,748
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

662
01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:12,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

663
01:00:13,588 --> 01:00:15,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on the after-school program, Ms.

664
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:15,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Caldwell.

665
01:00:16,209 --> 01:00:27,274
[SPEAKER_13]: So, as you probably know, I am assisting Shelly Gross, who I have to give a lot of credit for because this is her baby, this is her program, so I'm trying to be helpful here.

666
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:33,932
[SPEAKER_13]: We are proud to announce Medford's after-school program is flourishing.

667
01:00:34,573 --> 01:00:47,127
[SPEAKER_13]: All of our families are grateful and really very appreciative that they have a place to send their children after school, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 2 to 6, and then on Wednesday it's from 1.30 to 6 o'clock.

668
01:00:49,871 --> 01:00:55,217
[SPEAKER_13]: The children have opportunities to participate in fine arts and computer activities.

669
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Our staff understands the needs of each child.

670
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:05,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, we work very closely with Tony Vento so she can provide us any health care information on each child.

671
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently, at the Brooks, we have 130 children.

672
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:12,382
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually, Ms.

673
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:16,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Feely and I met with the after-school staff today, and D.L.C.

674
01:01:17,003 --> 01:01:22,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Avadi, who is the site coordinator at the Brooks, said, actually, Diane, we have 135 students.

675
01:01:23,005 --> 01:01:24,886
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's a lot for one school.

676
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:29,167
[SPEAKER_13]: The Columbus is up to 53, the McGlynn has 74, and the Roberts has 74 students.

677
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:37,725
[SPEAKER_13]: There are three levels of help in the after-school program.

678
01:01:38,245 --> 01:01:45,975
[SPEAKER_13]: The site coordinator has the primary responsibility to oversee the daily program, safety and well-being of the children.

679
01:01:46,738 --> 01:01:58,166
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the opportunity to go see Dale Ciavatti last Friday and watch how she manages 130 children with five different classes of K-1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

680
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:02,829
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was at the end of the school day on Friday.

681
01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:08,773
[SPEAKER_13]: So there was someone standing at the door saying, Mrs. Benedetto is here for her daughter.

682
01:02:09,133 --> 01:02:11,355
[SPEAKER_13]: And then another walkie talking on the other end said,

683
01:02:12,356 --> 01:02:19,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Billy to the front of the building, and parents have a responsibility to sign their children out so that we know there's a check system there.

684
01:02:22,225 --> 01:02:31,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Each site coordinator has a cell phone, and recently they've asked us for texting because it's easier to do in a school system, and Ms.

685
01:02:31,074 --> 01:02:34,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Feeley has provided our site coordinators now with texting on the phone.

686
01:02:36,321 --> 01:02:39,063
[SPEAKER_13]: It is not always easy to staff this program.

687
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:42,386
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, when you think about it, it's from two to six.

688
01:02:42,947 --> 01:02:51,214
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not for moms who have children who are coming home, but it is for those people who in the middle of the day maybe want to work.

689
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:53,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of our people are retired.

690
01:02:53,496 --> 01:02:53,856
[SPEAKER_13]: D.L.C.

691
01:02:53,876 --> 01:02:57,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Abadie is a retired school teacher, so she does a tremendous amount of work.

692
01:02:58,777 --> 01:03:00,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Kathy Hunt has been very instrumental.

693
01:03:00,919 --> 01:03:07,282
[SPEAKER_13]: She runs a little daycare herself from 9.30 to 12.30 and then comes over to our building afterwards.

694
01:03:08,443 --> 01:03:14,987
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have group leaders who are responsible for the classroom itself and curriculum and children and

695
01:03:15,413 --> 01:03:17,274
[SPEAKER_13]: make sure the children's needs are met.

696
01:03:17,955 --> 01:03:20,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have group assistants that work with the kids.

697
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:29,284
[SPEAKER_13]: And sometimes these are some of our high school kids who are able to get down to the schools or children, students from colleges.

698
01:03:29,904 --> 01:03:34,588
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually try to get students from Lesley, Tufts University, Salem State.

699
01:03:35,789 --> 01:03:40,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Problem with those kids is that after a semester, their schedules change.

700
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,873
[SPEAKER_13]: så att vi behöver anlägga andra i plats.

701
01:03:42,893 --> 01:03:55,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Jag vill tacka den här möjligheten att tacka Dale Ciavatti, Cathy Hunt och Sheryl Alpers som har varit instrumental i att hjälpa mig med att samarbeta med all den här informationen.

702
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Pat Velie och jag har jobbat samtidigt med den här programen.

703
01:04:01,036 --> 01:04:13,351
[SPEAKER_13]: I've supplied you with some information about the descriptions of the different leaders, pre-registration forms, letters, and the number of site coordinators and group leaders at each school.

704
01:04:14,513 --> 01:04:16,015
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be happy to answer any questions.

705
01:04:17,308 --> 01:04:18,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Ms.

706
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:18,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Calva.

707
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:21,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to receive and place on file?

708
01:04:21,951 --> 01:04:23,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Mr. Benedetto.

709
01:04:23,252 --> 01:04:24,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, by Ms.

710
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:26,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Vandesluis, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

711
01:04:26,514 --> 01:04:27,555
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

712
01:04:27,575 --> 01:04:27,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

713
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:29,116
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

714
01:04:29,676 --> 01:04:30,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper is placed on file.

715
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:34,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on summer program, Ms.

716
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:34,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Nelson?

717
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Report placed on file.

718
01:04:39,343 --> 01:04:39,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Summer's over.

719
01:04:42,765 --> 01:04:44,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to, is there a second?

720
01:04:46,127 --> 01:04:47,608
[SPEAKER_05]: This is second by Mr. Benedetto.

721
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:49,089
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

722
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:51,211
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

723
01:04:51,231 --> 01:04:53,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a motion to place on file and seconded.

724
01:04:53,893 --> 01:04:58,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Papers placed on file.

725
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:03,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on new cleaning service contract.

726
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:04,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

727
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:05,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Bailey or Ms.

728
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:06,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Superintendent?

729
01:05:13,963 --> 01:05:14,664
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

730
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:16,925
[SPEAKER_05]: All those against?

731
01:05:17,726 --> 01:05:20,207
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a motion on the floor for reconsideration of the vote.

732
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:22,108
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor for reconsideration?

733
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:25,691
[SPEAKER_05]: The paper's back before us.

734
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:33,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Please present your summary on the summer programming.

735
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:35,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, summer programs.

736
01:05:38,788 --> 01:05:46,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Vi presenter you in May with the report of all of our planned programs and we're happy to report that all went very well.

737
01:05:47,195 --> 01:05:49,897
[SPEAKER_10]: All programs were delivered as they were planned.

738
01:05:50,998 --> 01:06:05,030
[SPEAKER_10]: We have, the report I presented here was really put together by the individuals who oversee each of the programs and they gave you a short little summary of number of students and how the program went, the dates and so on.

739
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:07,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting with special education, which

740
01:06:08,238 --> 01:06:09,979
[SPEAKER_10]: was prepared by Cathy Medaglio.

741
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:29,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, this program is for students who are with IEPs that call for summer programs during those months, and over 120 students were enrolled in their programs that were held at the Roberts and Medford High School from July 5th through August 12th.

742
01:06:29,754 --> 01:06:34,478
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, the programming was really based on individual needs of those students.

743
01:06:35,365 --> 01:06:42,191
[SPEAKER_10]: English Language Learner Program, Leslie Trotta, director of ELL, prepared the information here.

744
01:06:42,391 --> 01:06:52,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Over 90 ELL students, and we had elementary, middle, and high school students participating in a variety of different programs, including the Newcomers Program.

745
01:06:53,400 --> 01:07:03,549
[SPEAKER_10]: The goal of these programs is, again, to improve the skills of these students through the summer so they don't lose some of the skills that they achieved during the school year.

746
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:05,457
[SPEAKER_10]: as well as to move them forward.

747
01:07:06,618 --> 01:07:09,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, there were field trips that were taken.

748
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:15,723
[SPEAKER_10]: The good news about this program is it is free of charge because it is funded by a Title III grant.

749
01:07:16,304 --> 01:07:19,345
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, that was a very successful program for those youngsters.

750
01:07:22,067 --> 01:07:28,111
[SPEAKER_10]: The Summer Fund Program, and this report was prepared by Anthony Petrellis, who is directing the program.

751
01:07:28,151 --> 01:07:33,094
[SPEAKER_10]: He's very happy to report this was the 10th year of this program, and it ran for eight weeks.

752
01:07:33,628 --> 01:07:38,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Beginning June 27th until August 15th.

753
01:07:38,871 --> 01:07:41,473
[SPEAKER_10]: And the students are 5 to 12 years old.

754
01:07:42,213 --> 01:07:49,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, even though the program has been in existence for 10 years, there were some new twists to this year's program.

755
01:07:49,758 --> 01:07:54,441
[SPEAKER_10]: And Anthony goes on to explain they added a few new elements to the camp.

756
01:07:54,941 --> 01:08:00,945
[SPEAKER_10]: They hired a full-time sports director who helped organize games for the individual groups.

757
01:08:01,681 --> 01:08:04,523
[SPEAKER_10]: as well as prepare scavenger hunts every Friday.

758
01:08:05,284 --> 01:08:07,006
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was another fun activity.

759
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:15,993
[SPEAKER_10]: They also opened up a camp Facebook page, which helped to keep parents informed about all the activities that were going on throughout the week.

760
01:08:16,854 --> 01:08:24,720
[SPEAKER_10]: And as Anthony reports, overall the year was a success, and he's looking forward to 10 more years and beyond of this particular program.

761
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:30,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Middle School Computer Science Camp, run by Molly Layden,

762
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:34,474
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, this is a program that is funded through another grant.

763
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:40,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And Molly had 15 students completing an app design program.

764
01:08:40,597 --> 01:08:45,278
[SPEAKER_10]: It was held at the McGlynn Middle School from June 27th through July 1st.

765
01:08:46,119 --> 01:08:50,941
[SPEAKER_10]: And the students developed 10 apps that were published in Google Play Store.

766
01:08:51,701 --> 01:08:59,884
[SPEAKER_10]: And the topics of the apps are parks in Medford, healthy eating, and wind turbine and solar panels.

767
01:09:00,453 --> 01:09:05,796
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, those youngsters had an opportunity to really improve their skills and technology.

768
01:09:07,457 --> 01:09:18,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Our regular summer school this year was facilitated by David Blau, who's assistant principal of Medford High School, and Jill Sawyer, who's assistant director of the vocational school.

769
01:09:19,504 --> 01:09:21,485
[SPEAKER_10]: We had over 140 students.

770
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:25,627
[SPEAKER_10]: This program serves students from grades six through 12.

771
01:09:27,257 --> 01:09:32,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it offers basically the core curriculum subjects for make-up.

772
01:09:32,539 --> 01:09:37,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, the courses, we run two courses, 8 to 10 and 10 to 12.

773
01:09:39,282 --> 01:09:46,245
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the new things that was very successful this year, we had a pilot program, our online science courses.

774
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:52,467
[SPEAKER_10]: We decided this year that we would try to get more into this type of programming.

775
01:09:53,239 --> 01:10:04,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Så med hjälp av Råkviseri, som tittade på kurskursen online och tvekte den, så matchade den vår kurskurs mer tydligt, så hade vi studenter som skulle göra forskning online.

776
01:10:04,544 --> 01:10:10,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Och det visade sig att vi hade några succesfulla saker som vi inte hade tänkt om.

777
01:10:10,287 --> 01:10:20,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Så en av dem, till exempel, var att vi tog in studenter från utanför distrikten, för distrikten som de var inne i, did not offer the summer program, let's say in chemistry.

778
01:10:21,102 --> 01:10:24,804
[SPEAKER_10]: så vi var able att bring in outside tuitions to the program.

779
01:10:25,404 --> 01:10:30,307
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing, it allowed the students really to have a longer time to finish.

780
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:32,768
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, when summer school is over, it's over.

781
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:36,590
[SPEAKER_10]: And if a student has mastered the content, they don't pass.

782
01:10:37,631 --> 01:10:42,714
[SPEAKER_10]: The students were allowed to take more time in August to finish because they could do it on their own online.

783
01:10:43,134 --> 01:10:48,557
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we had a few extra success stories that we would not have had had it not been for the online components.

784
01:10:49,021 --> 01:10:53,264
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking to develop this more fully because we see it has a lot of potential.

785
01:10:53,745 --> 01:10:55,066
[SPEAKER_10]: And the students seem to like it.

786
01:10:55,086 --> 01:10:56,306
[SPEAKER_10]: They all like technology.

787
01:10:56,346 --> 01:10:59,189
[SPEAKER_10]: They like to kind of progress at their own pace.

788
01:10:59,509 --> 01:11:04,793
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it was a very successful pilot.

789
01:11:06,594 --> 01:11:07,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

790
01:11:07,275 --> 01:11:18,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, the only thing that we saw we could improve in talking and debriefing with David and Jill is that we need to think of something that is a little different in structure for grades six and seven.

791
01:11:18,947 --> 01:11:20,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Those students really struggled.

792
01:11:20,787 --> 01:11:23,128
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard for them to sit there with the attention span.

793
01:11:23,828 --> 01:11:29,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're thinking next year, we'll bring it before the committee before any changes of maybe restructuring the program.

794
01:11:29,409 --> 01:11:33,970
[SPEAKER_10]: It works well with grade A kids, but for some reason, the sixth and seventh graders get very antsy.

795
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:46,153
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're thinking of maybe having a longer program that is broken up with things like, you know, activities, so that you can break up the academics with the activities, because that was the one area of improvement.

796
01:11:46,193 --> 01:11:47,233
[SPEAKER_10]: We're always looking to

797
01:11:48,235 --> 01:11:50,577
[SPEAKER_10]: in order to debrief and improve the areas that we can.

798
01:11:52,399 --> 01:12:11,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, one of the best things about the program is that students who didn't get their diploma in June because they were still deficient in coursework can get it once they make up the courses, and we had 12 of those youngsters who did receive diplomas at the end of summer school, so that was very successful.

799
01:12:13,056 --> 01:12:14,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, other programs.

800
01:12:16,085 --> 01:12:17,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just ask you a quick question?

801
01:12:17,805 --> 01:12:21,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Did those 12 get to WAC graduation last June?

802
01:12:21,507 --> 01:12:22,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to check.

803
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:24,687
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, can we invite them up?

804
01:12:25,268 --> 01:12:25,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, will do.

805
01:12:25,948 --> 01:12:26,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

806
01:12:27,888 --> 01:12:28,548
[SPEAKER_10]: High School 101.

807
01:12:28,809 --> 01:12:34,430
[SPEAKER_10]: This program was started a few years ago, and again, Nicole Kieser and David Blow oversee this program.

808
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:44,313
[SPEAKER_10]: It's designed for students in grade 8 who are going into grade 9 who have been having trouble with academics, and they've made it to grade 9,

809
01:12:45,268 --> 01:12:47,390
[SPEAKER_10]: We know they're going to need kind of a head start.

810
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:58,037
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we do is we basically, the summer work for all youngsters, all incoming ninth graders is reading, is English work, and there is math work.

811
01:12:58,717 --> 01:13:14,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what happens is these students at the end of the school year, they're given their school work, and then they're invited to come in a few days early to have teachers work with them and go over their summer work and make sure it's done.

812
01:13:14,797 --> 01:13:17,980
[SPEAKER_10]: and make sure that if they need help with something, they're getting that help.

813
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,341
[SPEAKER_10]: So we basically run this program.

814
01:13:21,002 --> 01:13:27,147
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a few days in duration, and then it ends with the regular orientation day for freshmen.

815
01:13:27,607 --> 01:13:32,010
[SPEAKER_10]: So these youngsters come into high school a little bit early, get some academic support.

816
01:13:32,331 --> 01:13:41,818
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually get a chance to meet some of the administrators a few days before, and then they kind of transition into the orientation day with all of the rest of their peers.

817
01:13:41,858 --> 01:13:43,359
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's been very successful.

818
01:13:44,406 --> 01:13:57,829
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a program that we used to be able to fund through academic support grant, but when that money kind of dried up, and again, this year we don't have academic support money, unfortunately, we, the district decided to support us.

819
01:13:57,849 --> 01:14:01,850
[SPEAKER_10]: So we thank you for your support because it has been very helpful to those students.

820
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:08,992
[SPEAKER_10]: They feel like the first day of school they're not behind because many of them used to come in and they hadn't done the summer reading or they hadn't done the math work.

821
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:10,692
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a real help to them.

822
01:14:12,192 --> 01:14:17,514
[SPEAKER_10]: At the vocational school, we had two programs, one for students, middle school students, and one for adults.

823
01:14:18,594 --> 01:14:35,020
[SPEAKER_10]: The middle school summer program, and again, Jill Sawyer prepared this report for us, 27 middle school students, they were both from the Andrews and McGlynn, pretty equally split, and it provides students the opportunity to get a taste of what happens at the vocational school.

824
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:41,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Because oftentimes, by the time they get to grade eight, they've made up their decision without really knowing what

825
01:14:42,243 --> 01:14:44,905
[SPEAKER_10]: is out there for them at the vocational school.

826
01:14:44,925 --> 01:14:52,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So this gives them a chance to get into the vocational school, to see the programs, actually experience the programs.

827
01:14:52,831 --> 01:14:55,633
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it's been very successful.

828
01:14:55,693 --> 01:14:59,195
[SPEAKER_10]: It started last year, and again, it was continued this year.

829
01:14:59,956 --> 01:15:04,039
[SPEAKER_10]: And their students were very, and parents were very receptive to that one.

830
01:15:04,219 --> 01:15:06,621
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was another success story.

831
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:09,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And the adult program, the adult summer construction program,

832
01:15:10,696 --> 01:15:13,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Riccio provided us with information on this.

833
01:15:15,058 --> 01:15:19,879
[SPEAKER_10]: This was an eight-week program that ran July 8th, I'm sorry, July 11th through August 31st.

834
01:15:20,419 --> 01:15:23,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Fifteen adult students participated.

835
01:15:23,721 --> 01:15:35,365
[SPEAKER_10]: They received OSHA construction certification, CPR, and first aid certification, and entry-level training in both the construction and carpentry fields.

836
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:39,286
[SPEAKER_10]: The end result was to prepare them for entry-level positions

837
01:15:39,871 --> 01:15:41,532
[SPEAKER_10]: at corporate and union entities.

838
01:15:42,153 --> 01:15:48,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Fifteen participants graduated last week from the program and are now beginning the interview process with industry.

839
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:55,262
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was our summer, busy, productive, and a lot of students did benefit from these programs.

840
01:15:55,646 --> 01:15:56,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

841
01:15:56,647 --> 01:15:56,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

842
01:15:56,847 --> 01:15:57,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

843
01:15:58,608 --> 01:15:59,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

844
01:15:59,649 --> 01:16:00,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Nelson.

845
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:03,573
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, this report was wonderful.

846
01:16:04,053 --> 01:16:05,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It really gave us an insight.

847
01:16:06,335 --> 01:16:13,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives everybody an insight of really what was going on during the year, that it wasn't like the doors closed and everybody went off on vacation.

848
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:20,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank everyone for really thinking outside the box and really bringing in new and vibrant ideas.

849
01:16:21,407 --> 01:16:25,777
[SPEAKER_03]: and it seems like it was very successful for many people and for a lot of our students.

850
01:16:27,247 --> 01:16:29,648
[SPEAKER_03]: summer time program 10 years and running.

851
01:16:30,888 --> 01:16:34,469
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a little personal baby of mine, so I'm really happy about that.

852
01:16:34,889 --> 01:16:43,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thrilled that we were able to get students to really see what the vocational school is about and showing them the jewel that it has.

853
01:16:44,011 --> 01:16:48,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It has always been the summer program for our adults.

854
01:16:49,012 --> 01:16:53,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It just it gives us a little bit and it gives I think everyone a little bit of an insight of.

855
01:16:54,133 --> 01:17:01,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, maybe we didn't have the money for certain things, but it didn't stop anyone from going and achieving and providing.

856
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:08,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this report is really an extraordinary important report in that it gives everybody that information.

857
01:17:08,448 --> 01:17:11,792
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, and thank you to everyone who really participated in this.

858
01:17:11,812 --> 01:17:12,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank all my colleagues.

859
01:17:12,793 --> 01:17:13,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't put this together.

860
01:17:13,854 --> 01:17:15,095
[SPEAKER_10]: You saw the names of the people that

861
01:17:15,425 --> 01:17:17,428
[SPEAKER_10]: and providing me with all the information, so I thank them.

862
01:17:17,528 --> 01:17:20,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little side bit of the students who didn't maybe walk.

863
01:17:21,895 --> 01:17:29,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew of a student who actually, not this year, but had received his certification after he had done his summer program.

864
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:35,816
[SPEAKER_03]: and I insisted that he wear my son's cap and gowns just to take pictures.

865
01:17:36,476 --> 01:17:42,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And at first he was like, no, but it really made a difference and he sent them back to his mother.

866
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:45,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And for some students, that's the only opportunity.

867
01:17:45,442 --> 01:17:56,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we do have our students that have not walked and we are able to do maybe a cap and gown, even to show some pictures and we'll give them the diplomas here, I think that would be really nice.

868
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:58,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get you Mr. Blow tomorrow, first thing.

869
01:17:58,211 --> 01:17:58,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

870
01:17:58,971 --> 01:17:59,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

871
01:17:59,492 --> 01:17:59,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Nelson.

872
01:18:03,081 --> 01:18:05,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I just also think the report was great.

873
01:18:05,183 --> 01:18:08,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is one of those good news reports, and it's important that we that we hear it.

874
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:18,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I particularly also liked hearing, you know, that there was a challenge and that's and we're looking at our summer school for grades six and seven.

875
01:18:18,034 --> 01:18:20,476
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's very valuable for us to hear as well.

876
01:18:20,536 --> 01:18:23,118
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate the delivery of the report.

877
01:18:23,318 --> 01:18:24,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Scary.

878
01:18:24,759 --> 01:18:27,922
[SPEAKER_15]: I would ask my colleagues to

879
01:18:28,513 --> 01:18:41,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking at the possibility of having a formal exercise for any student that receives or completes his diploma requirements after his graduating class, so that they can be properly and formally recognized as graduates of Medford High School.

880
01:18:41,922 --> 01:18:44,364
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I asked that question.

881
01:18:44,664 --> 01:18:47,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Specifically for that purpose, because they deserve that honor of crossing.

882
01:18:48,466 --> 01:18:49,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if it's here, this is quite nice as well.

883
01:18:50,027 --> 01:18:51,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd offer that in the form of a motion.

884
01:18:51,308 --> 01:18:53,650
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a special moment in a youngster's life, so.

885
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:55,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion on the floor, Executive.

886
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:56,986
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

887
01:18:57,286 --> 01:18:57,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

888
01:18:57,826 --> 01:18:58,447
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

889
01:18:58,467 --> 01:18:59,448
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

890
01:18:59,548 --> 01:18:59,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

891
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:04,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll report on the new cleaning service contract.

892
01:19:04,772 --> 01:19:04,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

893
01:19:05,012 --> 01:19:05,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Bailey.

894
01:19:09,235 --> 01:19:10,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Mayor and School Committee.

895
01:19:10,817 --> 01:19:11,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

896
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleaning janitorial services RFP 17-0206.

897
01:19:15,601 --> 01:19:19,424
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a report on the contract award.

898
01:19:19,804 --> 01:19:21,105
[SPEAKER_04]: It did go out for proposals.

899
01:19:21,785 --> 01:19:22,326
[SPEAKER_04]: We had

900
01:19:22,797 --> 01:19:23,818
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a few responses.

901
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:25,719
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we were very pleased with the number.

902
01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:29,181
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually got a competitive look at cleaning services.

903
01:19:30,062 --> 01:19:32,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of those, we interviewed the top four.

904
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:43,171
[SPEAKER_04]: The top four were evaluated by John McLaughlin, Buildings and Grounds Director, and he evaluated them using a format where he was fair and impartial across the board.

905
01:19:44,052 --> 01:19:51,917
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought MP Building Services, GCA Services, Empire Cleaning, and Prospect Building Services in for a interview process.

906
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:54,535
[SPEAKER_04]: with the superintendent, John and myself.

907
01:19:55,636 --> 01:20:02,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only did the four make our evaluation top four, there was actually a tie for number three, but they had to meet our budget constraints.

908
01:20:03,863 --> 01:20:07,726
[SPEAKER_04]: So upon that, they were all asked the same questions.

909
01:20:07,826 --> 01:20:18,435
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked into background security review, union shop versus non-union, experiences in cleaning public buildings, uniform requirements, safety training, student-staff interaction training,

910
01:20:19,455 --> 01:20:22,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Vendors had the opportunity to ask additional questions of NPS.

911
01:20:23,137 --> 01:20:28,439
[SPEAKER_04]: After all was said and done, we met one more time and we evaluated the rating system.

912
01:20:28,779 --> 01:20:41,585
[SPEAKER_04]: There really wasn't any change in how they rated initially, but by the time we got done and looked at their rating for evaluation and their rating for budget price concerns, we then selected Prospect as our vendor.

913
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:45,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were deemed a responsible contractor.

914
01:20:45,602 --> 01:20:46,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they were.

915
01:20:46,282 --> 01:20:48,142
[SPEAKER_04]: John followed up with references as well.

916
01:20:49,463 --> 01:20:50,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Mr. Skerry.

917
01:20:51,063 --> 01:20:56,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Has Prospect Building Services ever worked for Metro Public Schools before and where are they located?

918
01:20:56,365 --> 01:20:59,806
[SPEAKER_04]: They have not, but they have worked for several other school systems and still do.

919
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:01,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, where are they located?

920
01:21:01,286 --> 01:21:01,927
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in Malden.

921
01:21:01,947 --> 01:21:09,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Do they have a contact person if we get calls that something has to be adjusted to or should we just direct everything to the business office?

922
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:12,350
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we have our own on-site supervisor.

923
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:12,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

924
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also have our own contact person.

925
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:22,263
[SPEAKER_15]: And at some future time, could you provide the name of that person to us in case we have to get in touch with them?

926
01:21:22,643 --> 01:21:22,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.

927
01:21:22,983 --> 01:21:25,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have that come out of Dr. or out of John McLaughlin's office.

928
01:21:25,824 --> 01:21:26,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

929
01:21:26,204 --> 01:21:26,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

930
01:21:31,205 --> 01:21:31,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

931
01:21:31,866 --> 01:21:34,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any other questions from Mr. Benedetto?

932
01:21:35,767 --> 01:21:39,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not in regard to this, but I wanted to ask Pat while she's there.

933
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:43,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I know transportation has been happening throughout the community.

934
01:21:43,414 --> 01:21:44,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it okay if I ask that at this time?

935
01:21:45,335 --> 01:21:46,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

936
01:21:46,516 --> 01:21:50,119
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just like, I know that there was a little update on it.

937
01:21:50,179 --> 01:21:57,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to hear from you like how things are going and if our homeless students all have rights to school at this point.

938
01:21:58,364 --> 01:21:59,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I ask this every year.

939
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:00,246
[SPEAKER_04]: You do, you do.

940
01:22:00,646 --> 01:22:02,027
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been our typical startup.

941
01:22:02,207 --> 01:22:03,688
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we always have the transitions.

942
01:22:04,122 --> 01:22:04,963
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the tweaking.

943
01:22:05,363 --> 01:22:10,547
[SPEAKER_04]: We have routes stops that we had eliminated, only to find that there were still indeed families using them.

944
01:22:10,647 --> 01:22:11,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to bring them back down.

945
01:22:12,028 --> 01:22:13,789
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to reshuffle the routes.

946
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:18,233
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, the middle school routes four and nine were very crowded.

947
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:22,816
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we brought on bus number 17, which was on duty for an elementary run.

948
01:22:23,197 --> 01:22:25,018
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's now making a middle school run.

949
01:22:25,058 --> 01:22:27,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's alleviated the crowding on that side.

950
01:22:28,601 --> 01:22:30,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I think we're in pretty good shape.

951
01:22:30,783 --> 01:22:32,564
[SPEAKER_04]: This morning, knock on wood,

952
01:22:32,978 --> 01:22:36,479
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very quiet, which is always a really good sign.

953
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:38,639
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have a little more tweaking to go on.

954
01:22:38,659 --> 01:22:42,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a couple parents that are looking for a change in their route.

955
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:48,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I tell them, the first couple weeks of school are always more about safety and overcrowding.

956
01:22:48,941 --> 01:22:51,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I then deal with the cosmetic things a little later on.

957
01:22:51,501 --> 01:22:53,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And our homeless students?

958
01:22:54,182 --> 01:22:57,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Our homeless students, it's getting started up.

959
01:22:57,162 --> 01:22:58,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a slow process.

960
01:22:59,022 --> 01:23:02,103
[SPEAKER_04]: As you well know, it's about finding out the data.

961
01:23:02,782 --> 01:23:10,485
[SPEAKER_04]: making sure that what we're looking at is the true situation, and then finding out where we need to be sending them to.

962
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:17,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a long process, and sometimes it's very difficult to get to the very basis of what's going on with homeless transportation.

963
01:23:17,528 --> 01:23:21,990
[SPEAKER_04]: But those students that we are successful with at this point do have transport.

964
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:23,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

965
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:29,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure that every child's able to attend no matter where they might be sheltered.

966
01:23:31,112 --> 01:23:36,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if they lose their homes, they really need their school and their community and that stability in their lives.

967
01:23:36,735 --> 01:23:46,659
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I always ask that at the beginning of the year, just to make sure that I know it's much more complicated and much more expensive than people think.

968
01:23:47,179 --> 01:23:52,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just so important and it touches my heart when we can't get a child to school.

969
01:23:53,602 --> 01:23:55,743
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I ask that every year.

970
01:23:55,783 --> 01:23:59,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll keep asking you over the next few weeks that as soon as everybody has arrived

971
01:24:00,057 --> 01:24:02,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Please just let me know and I'll just let you know.

972
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:07,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you know, Medford makes it a priority to take care of our families that do have real need, right?

973
01:24:07,763 --> 01:24:10,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we do, and it is a process.

974
01:24:10,265 --> 01:24:17,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it takes, you know, a month into school to make sure that every child has arrived in different situations.

975
01:24:17,991 --> 01:24:27,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So and I want to say thank you to you, because this is a big undertaking at the beginning of the year, as well as getting us informed about all the budgetary things.

976
01:24:27,739 --> 01:24:29,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate that effort on

977
01:24:30,355 --> 01:24:31,577
[SPEAKER_06]: on the behalf of all of it.

978
01:24:31,897 --> 01:24:33,679
[SPEAKER_06]: All of our administrators do that.

979
01:24:34,139 --> 01:24:36,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, getting up and running isn't an easy task.

980
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:40,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, you have to look at us and have our reports ready.

981
01:24:41,892 --> 01:24:42,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

982
01:24:43,134 --> 01:24:44,115
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

983
01:24:44,415 --> 01:24:44,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

984
01:24:44,835 --> 01:24:47,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file?

985
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:48,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

986
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

987
01:24:51,463 --> 01:24:52,204
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

989
01:24:53,805 --> 01:24:54,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

990
01:24:55,287 --> 01:24:59,872
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could ask that someone make a motion that we move negotiations and legal matters to the end of the calendar.

991
01:25:00,953 --> 01:25:02,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved by Mrs. Scarry, seconded by Ms.

992
01:25:02,934 --> 01:25:03,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanden Heude.

993

1000
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:52,660
[SPEAKER_08]: to recommend to you that the Director of Finance and Administrative position be awarded to Kirsteen Patterson, who is currently in Southern Middlesex Vocational Tech, and she's here this evening, and you have the documents in front of you, and that I'd ask for a formal vote nominating and electing Kirsteen to the position for two-year contract at the rate that's stipulated.

1001
01:25:53,237 --> 01:25:58,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to receive, to accept, to offer the contract by Mr. Scarry?

1002
01:25:58,782 --> 01:26:00,563

[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the committee every year we select a delegate and alternative alternate to the M.A.S.C.

[SPEAKER_08]: and let them know and also to let you know that if you expect to attend I would like to register you as soon as possible so we can get the optimum rates for the conference and we can move forward.

[SPEAKER_08]: It's an important activity.

1020

[SPEAKER_08]: There's a new federal law.

1023
01:27:18,256 --> 01:27:19,237
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to be involved.

1024
01:27:19,778 --> 01:27:27,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you a lot of things, but you need to have an opportunity to interact with your colleagues in those settings and see what other people are talking about.

1025
01:27:28,303 --> 01:27:33,884
[SPEAKER_08]: and get an idea of what's really happening in the Commonwealth and the federal government as we move forward with public education.

1026
01:27:33,924 --> 01:27:35,425
[SPEAKER_08]: This year is particularly significant.

1027
01:27:36,005 --> 01:27:45,327
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of things in front of us that could alter the nature of what we do, especially ESSA, charter schools, other things that could happen.

1028
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:47,768
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important that you interact with your colleagues.

1029
01:27:47,788 --> 01:27:53,109
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask that you nominate a delegate and an alternate, and at the same token,

1030
01:27:53,505 --> 01:27:58,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me information as to whether you intend to attend, so I can make appropriate arrangements on your behalf.

[SPEAKER_03]: Miss Cuneo.

1042
01:28:35,568 --> 01:28:39,090
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest with you, this is 11 years.

1043
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:48,195
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been 11 years I've either been alternate, well with Paulette, either alternate or delegate or president of the organization.

1044
01:28:48,455 --> 01:28:51,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, I don't know about anybody else.

1045
01:28:51,536 --> 01:28:54,458
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody else would love to do this, I would love to see them there.

1046
01:28:55,979 --> 01:28:57,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I haven't checked my calendar.

1047
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm going down.

1048
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:02,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been going down for 11 years, but either that

1049
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:07,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Either that or we just check our calendars to see who's definitely going to go.

1050
01:29:07,559 --> 01:29:09,840
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we'll table this to the following week.

1051
01:29:12,981 --> 01:29:19,243
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have one, but we can certainly... But to definitely urge people to tell you if they're going to the conference.

1052
01:29:19,283 --> 01:29:21,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely know I'm going to the conference.

1053
01:29:25,085 --> 01:29:26,386

1055
01:29:30,985 --> 01:29:33,467

1056
01:29:33,487 --> 01:29:34,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Please submit your name.

1057
01:29:34,668 --> 01:29:41,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's very important that you do tell the Superintendent ASAP who is going down because that way they can book the rooms.

1058
01:29:41,954 --> 01:29:47,259
[SPEAKER_06]: The cost Mr Superintendent.

1059
01:29:52,835 --> 01:29:53,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have it here?

1060
01:29:54,096 --> 01:29:56,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe it's on this particular, but I'll certainly provide it to you.

1061
01:29:56,317 --> 01:29:57,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Provided in our next packet?

1062

01:32:33,775 --> 01:32:39,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of 9-11.

1097
01:32:39,456 --> 01:32:47,798
And although we're 4,500 miles from New York, we did have a connection with it.

1098
01:32:47,838 --> 01:32:55,699
And John Darby was a Memphis resident, grew up on Newton Road, played baseball at Memphis High and Boston College.

1099
01:32:55,879 --> 01:32:58,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And he taught for a couple of years at Forest Park School.

1100
01:32:59,888 --> 01:33:08,354
[SPEAKER_02]: John was at his desk when the first plane hit the West Tower and they never were able to recover any of his remains.

1101
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:13,477
[SPEAKER_02]: But John was a true son of Medford, bled Mustang blue and

1102
01:33:29,685 --> 01:33:40,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Eagles of maroon and gold, and I hope that the Memphis residents won't forget that we did lose somebody very close to us on 9-11, and that this travesty never happens again.

1103
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:42,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

1104
01:33:44,271 --> 01:33:44,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1105
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:44,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Vandeglut?

1106
01:33:45,472 --> 01:33:47,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd also just like to add a comment.

1107
01:33:47,513 --> 01:33:58,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, before the school committee, the members of the school committee were down at the McGlynn and Andrews property, which, as you know, is on Freedom Way.

1108
01:33:59,848 --> 01:34:08,271
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was named Freedom Way because our schools opened in 2001 on 9-10.

1109
01:34:09,932 --> 01:34:16,375
[SPEAKER_11]: And on Tuesday morning, I happened to be there dropping off my child and, you know, doing those things.

1110
01:34:17,155 --> 01:34:23,458
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was sitting outside of the Andrews School that I had my radio on and heard the report and went into the schools.

1111
01:34:24,318 --> 01:34:29,580
[SPEAKER_11]: And so as I sit there and sat, and of course this being such a, you know, important anniversary

1112
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,561
[SPEAKER_11]: The schools to me are also so very closely tied to that memory.

1113
01:34:34,141 --> 01:34:48,425
[SPEAKER_11]: And our commitment to each and every one of our students and families in Medford to have a free, wonderful education, because that is what I think is the most important thing in our democracy for all our kids.

1114
01:34:49,505 --> 01:34:49,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

1115
01:34:49,946 --> 01:34:50,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Gandicloup.

1116
01:34:52,026 --> 01:34:54,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto, did you wish to speak on?

1117
01:34:54,587 --> 01:34:55,207
[SPEAKER_05]: No, thank you.

1118
01:35:01,788 --> 01:35:07,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent, you wanted to make an announcement in regards to some programming for the school system?

1119
01:35:07,052 --> 01:35:08,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you, Madam Mayor.

1120
01:35:08,454 --> 01:35:11,716
[SPEAKER_08]: This evening you've received a packet from our public information office.

1121
01:35:12,437 --> 01:35:16,500
[SPEAKER_08]: There are many terrific activities going on in our city over the next couple of weeks.

1122
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:20,063
[SPEAKER_08]: I urge you to pay attention to them because I know you want to participate.

1123
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:22,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that Lisa has put all this together for you.

1124
01:35:24,567 --> 01:35:29,811
[SPEAKER_08]: And to let you know that there's many events and that, you know, our people will be participating.

1125
01:35:30,548 --> 01:35:32,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Community Day, it's Tufts Community Day.

1126
01:35:32,589 --> 01:35:37,572
[SPEAKER_08]: The 25th is... Crystal Campbell unveiling is September 25th.

1127
01:35:37,612 --> 01:35:43,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Crystal Campbell unveiling, former Medford High School student who was lost in the Marathon bombing.

1128
01:35:43,816 --> 01:35:44,836
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot going on.

1129
01:35:45,637 --> 01:35:52,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also want to point out to you that varsity teams are undefeated right now.

1130
01:35:53,221 --> 01:35:59,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And anybody who thinks that the Patriots win or the Red Sox win yesterday was important on the weekend.

1131
01:36:00,386 --> 01:36:04,247
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mustangs winning on Friday night was the most important win of the weekend.

1132
01:36:05,407 --> 01:36:07,387
[SPEAKER_08]: We came back and beat Revere 30 to 28.

1133
01:36:08,387 --> 01:36:09,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Great win for our guys.

1134
01:36:10,008 --> 01:36:11,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're off to a great start.

1135
01:36:11,088 --> 01:36:13,628
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking for number two next Friday at Belmont.

1136
01:36:13,968 --> 01:36:14,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

1137
01:36:14,648 --> 01:36:15,729
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll look forward to it.

1138
01:36:15,889 --> 01:36:19,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, the boys' soccer team traveled to Ludlow.

1139
01:36:20,089 --> 01:36:22,250
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ludlow is a perennial state.

1140
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:25,310
[SPEAKER_08]: They've won 17 state soccer championships for boys.

1141
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:29,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And Medford has been in the state championship game three times.

1142
01:36:29,715 --> 01:36:32,976
[SPEAKER_08]: And each time we lost a lot of them.

1143
01:36:34,337 --> 01:36:38,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I played in the first one and we got beat the worst.

1144
01:36:38,299 --> 01:36:40,460
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll take I'll take the heat for that.

1145
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:45,542
[SPEAKER_08]: But the reality is is this time for the last two times we played them, we've tied them one to one.

1146
01:36:45,562 --> 01:36:47,963
[SPEAKER_08]: The next time we play them, we're going to win.

1147
01:36:48,683 --> 01:36:49,903
[SPEAKER_08]: So just so you know what's going on.

1148
01:36:50,344 --> 01:36:50,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

1149
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,204
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1150
01:36:51,649 --> 01:36:51,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1151
01:36:51,989 --> 01:36:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss Kunio.

1152
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:59,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to piggyback on what the superintendent said, again, I want to congratulate the football team.

1153
01:36:59,717 --> 01:37:00,698
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great night.

1154
01:37:00,818 --> 01:37:02,300
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great community night.

1155
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:04,502
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a beautiful weather night.

1156
01:37:05,383 --> 01:37:07,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Our cheerleaders did an amazing job.

1157
01:37:07,725 --> 01:37:09,847
[SPEAKER_03]: The marching band did an amazing job.

1158
01:37:09,947 --> 01:37:14,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And our new organization that's out there that's kind of taken over a little bit of the old pep

1159
01:37:15,503 --> 01:37:18,284
[SPEAKER_03]: group that we used to have are now called the staying gang.

1160
01:37:18,924 --> 01:37:21,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just a great, great night.

1161
01:37:22,004 --> 01:37:33,927
[SPEAKER_03]: But with that being said, you know, first of all, definitely, if you have the opportunity to go on the website, it's mpsa, I'm sorry, mpsadvantage.education.

1162
01:37:34,007 --> 01:37:34,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Please go on.

1163
01:37:35,367 --> 01:37:37,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It shows and tells you everything that's going on.

1164
01:37:38,168 --> 01:37:40,568
[SPEAKER_03]: But just a couple of things this week.

1165
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:49,357
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just want to go out and help our schools and help the community, the crew team is having their first fundraiser at Salvatores on the 13th.

1166
01:37:50,708 --> 01:37:51,789
[SPEAKER_03]: from 7 to 9.

[SPEAKER_03]: On the 17th, we have the fourth Crystal Campbell motorcycle run that starts at 8 o'clock at the VFW.

1169
01:38:06,842 --> 01:38:12,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that run, we urge you to come to Hormel Stadium.

1170
01:38:13,448 --> 01:38:14,569
[SPEAKER_03]: No, a motorcycle run.

1171
01:38:14,589 --> 01:38:15,330
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not 8 o'clock.

1172
01:38:15,912 --> 01:38:19,094
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts at 8 for registration, but 11 o'clock for... Much later, yes.

1173
01:38:20,955 --> 01:38:23,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're going to be on the motorcycle, you have to be there at 8.

[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have everything else.

1178
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:43,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also want to congratulate Mrs. Van de Kloot and her husband, who are the grand

1180
01:38:55,716 --> 01:38:56,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to say that.

1181
01:38:57,277 --> 01:38:58,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.
