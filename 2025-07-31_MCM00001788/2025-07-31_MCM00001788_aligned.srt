1
00:00:01,778 --> 00:00:03,019
Okay, hello everyone.

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:05,080
We're gonna start the meeting.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,061
So we're gonna go ahead and start recording.

4
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:09,462
Recording in progress.

5
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:11,103
Sorry.

6
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:12,504
Recording stopped.

7
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:16,186
Recording in progress.

8
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:17,266
Okay, great.

9
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,428
So now we're recording.

10
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:25,971
Just real quick for those on Zoom, can you confirm if you can see the slideshow we have pulled up?

11
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:26,992
Okay, wonderful.

12
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:30,324
All right, well, just a quick welcome.

13
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:31,824
I want to thank you all for joining.

14
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:42,067
For those who are interested in pulling up the action plan, we can drop a link into the chat.

15
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:46,189
And I'll just turn it over to the board if you want to introduce yourselves.

16
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:47,229
Thank you.

17
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,290
Thank you all for logging in, for coming in person today.

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:57,292
My name is Lisa Davidson, and I am the chair of the Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

19
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:00,284
I'm Penny Taylor.

20
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:03,386
I am the vice chair of the Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

21
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:08,330
And I'm Roberta Cameron, a member of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

22
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:14,015
And all three of us have worked on the action plan.

23
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:18,899
We're part of the action plan committee, the five-year action plan committee.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,701
Thank you for all coming in.

25
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:27,506
What we're going to do today is we are really excited to share our action plan

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:52,210
What you're gonna expect from today is an introduction, which will include a survey, a presentation about the affordable housing trust fund background, some data that we used in developing the action plan, affordable housing definition and resources, and then we're going to jump right into the action plan and then talk about next steps and questions.

27
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:59,165
All right, so we already talked about some of the members of the board who are here today.

28
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,346
I also want to mention our great city staffer, Catherine Buckingham.

29
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:06,127
And then we have a survey on the next slide.

30
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:11,869
I do also want to say we have three other board members who aren't with us here.

31
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:13,730
I'm not sure if they're online, but hello if you are.

32
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,032
So we are, you know, as part of this process, we're gathering information along the way.

33
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:23,271
super curious who's in the room with us right now.

34
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:25,734
So there's a survey right here.

35
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:31,020
If you can scan it or type in the code to just give us a little bit of information.

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,848
It's stuff like renting and owning and just give us a sense of who's in here and who's contributing to this conversation throughout.

37
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,009
That would be really helpful.

38
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:41,492
You can take a minute and do that right now.

39
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:54,399
And I wonder if we might actually be able to stop the presentation for a moment and just be able to see the participants.

40
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:56,741
Hello.

41
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:00,288
Thank you.

42
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,550
Just if you can make a list of participants.

43
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:14,355
Has anyone who is participating today been here for the previous public meeting that we had?

44
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:18,677
All right.

45
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:28,321
And I do see we have a board member who is online, Mila Leffen, and another great city staffer, Theresa DuPont, both contributed lots to this plan.

46
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,402
So thanks for being here.

47
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,134
on this exciting occasion.

48
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:33,015
Thank you very much.

49
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:34,576
You can go back to the presentation.

50
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:42,822
Great.

51
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:43,383
All right.

52
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:48,186
So hope everybody had a moment to take the survey.

53
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:51,528
Thank you for participating in the survey.

54
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:57,993
Now I'm just going to go right on to give you a little bit of background about the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

55
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:01,135
The next slide.

56
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,662
So just the presentation is not being shared on the Zoom.

57
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:12,623
Thanks.

58
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:13,223
Perfect.

59
00:04:13,323 --> 00:04:13,683
Thank you.

60
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:15,685
Thank you, Kelly.

61
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,230
Good.

62
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:23,951
All right.

63
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:27,093
So the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, who are we?

64
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:29,716
Well, how did we get here?

65
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:43,419
In 2024, the Metro City Council established the trust to address some of the ongoing, growing affordable housing crisis.

66
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,061
The trust is made up of seven volunteers.

67
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:52,522
There is the mayor or a designee.

68
00:04:53,457 --> 00:05:05,205
There is somebody from the Community Preservation, no, yeah, Community Preservation Committee, a member, and then there's five residents that join the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

69
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:14,131
Volunteers were appointed in July 2024, so we have been going for a full year now, exciting.

70
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:22,237
And we are supported by staff through the Medford Planning and Development and Sustainability

71
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:33,785
The purpose we're here for today is really we're going to be addressing or what the trust is here is to address the affordable housing needs.

72
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:49,409
Today, we're going to share the data, as I said earlier, we're going to share the data that was used in developing the plan, and then we are going to roll out the affordable housing or the action plan, excuse me.

73
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,082
I am excited.

74
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:57,524
All right, so I just gotta give you a recap.

75
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:07,869
Sorry, for some reason, what we're seeing on our screen that we're sharing, we can tell is not updating for the folks on the Zoom.

76
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:14,113
Teresa, can you tell us what you see on the current slide?

77
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:18,295
Yeah, I'm seeing the internal view, so I'm seeing,

78
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:21,450
I'm not seeing the screen full screen.

79
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,173
So if you hit from current slide, I wonder if that'll take it full screen.

80
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:36,302
So we just did that, and it shows it full screen on the computer we're sharing from.

81
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:42,167
But for some reason, we can tell on the extra computer we brought that it's not going into full screen mode.

82
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:47,471
I might recommend to stop sharing and then try to reshare.

83
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:47,531
OK.

84
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:49,657
Thank you for.

85
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:51,178
Thank you.

86
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,939
Sorry for jinxing it when we had it all worked out.

87
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,039
Yeah.

88
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:16,528
It's still not sharing.

89
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:21,715
It's strange because it's full screen, and we shared it on the computer.

90
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,857
So if you don't do full screen, does it share?

91
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:28,878
Oh, I just mean like we hit Play Slideshow.

92
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:33,720
But even so, it's just showing the internal, you know, this.

93
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,422
What's the slide control up that way, up on the top menu?

94
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:52,445
Worst case scenario, we could always zoom in in the control window on the bottom right.

95
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:59,687
With that 55% right now, perhaps make it a little bigger there if the full screen sharing doesn't work.

96
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,611
Sorry about this.

97
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:17,413
We had it working and don't know why it's not doing the full screen version.

98
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:22,899
Got it, there it is.

99
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,421
Okay, thanks, Juliet, for fixing that.

100
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:27,882
Okay, sorry, Lisa, please go ahead.

101
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,243
No, thank you, thank you.

102
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:37,587
Everybody can see that we are now going to talk about the process of the, how we came across the, or what we did in the five-year plan.

103
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:43,150
September through December, 2024, we worked, the three of us worked together.

104
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,772
We evaluated the market data and policy context.

105
00:08:47,445 --> 00:09:04,677
From December through January, 2025, we conducted focus groups with affordable housing stakeholders and those stakeholders included nonprofit agencies and it included developers around the community.

106
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:11,522
The February through March, we gathered public input for the community meeting and surveys.

107
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:14,284
We held a community meeting in March

108
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,150
Was it in March?

109
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,290
It must have been March.

110
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,271
In-person or hybrid meeting, very similar to this.

111
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:30,754
And then April through June, there was the draft plan that was presented to the entire Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

112
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:37,095
And here we are today, we're doing a public review of the draft plan.

113
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:41,616
Right now, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund has $300,000 available to

114
00:09:46,487 --> 00:10:00,238
fill gaps in developments, housing developments, so people can apply to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund for additional finances to fill the gap when they're developing their housing, $300,000.

115
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,082
In May, excuse me, we released an RFP.

116
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:08,846
In May, we released the RFP, the Housing Construction Grants.

117
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:11,728
August is when applications are due.

118
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,637
And then in September, grants funds will be committed.

119
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:24,826
And I want to publicly say thank you to Roberta, who did a lot of the heavy lifting when it came to drafting the plan and collected the data.

120
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:25,867
So thank you, Roberta.

121
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:31,353
And on that note, I am going to let Roberta do some speaking.

122
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:33,004
Thank you.

123
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:46,206
So to set the context for developing this plan and for establishing the Affordable Housing Trust, the city, there were numerous steps that happened before this group even formed.

124
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:52,247
First, the city of Medford adopted the Community Preservation Act back in 2015.

125
00:10:52,607 --> 00:11:00,829
This created the first pool of funding that could be available for affordable housing that the city had outside of

126
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:02,469
federal funding.

127
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:04,630
It's the first local funding available.

128
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:16,796
And to decide how to spend Community Preservation Act money, the Community Preservation Committee talked with stakeholders and talked with the community.

129
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:27,821
And one of the things that they learned in that process is the need for an affordable housing plan to show what does the community even want for affordable housing.

130
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:33,943
So the city undertook to develop the housing production plan, which was adopted in 2021.

131
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:47,349
And at the same time, the city was gearing up to undertake its first comprehensive plan, which was a community-wide effort to think about what do we want the city of Medford to look like in the future?

132
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,970
And that was completed and adopted in 2023.

133
00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:07,380
in implementing the recommendations from the housing production plan and the comprehensive plan, the city has been undertaking the zoning initiative that we've heard a lot about this year.

134
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:21,571
So the first phase of zoning was adopted in 2023 and subsequent phases have either been adopted or under discussion right now or anticipated in the near future.

135
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:36,245
But aside from zoning policy that defines what can be built across the city, one of the other bits of feedback that we've heard from stakeholders is a need for more money to support more affordable housing.

136
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:41,990
And so to help to make that happen, the city established the Affordable Housing Trust.

137
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:46,133
which was adopted in 2024.

138
00:12:47,753 --> 00:12:53,855
And this committee that manages the Affordable Housing Trust was appointed about a year ago.

139
00:12:55,295 --> 00:13:01,737
So we've spent the first year trying to figure out what are we going to do to create more affordable housing.

140
00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:03,337
So that's what brings us here today.

141
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:06,598
And then there's more ongoing.

142
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:12,060
We're just a step in that process of trying to address the needs.

143
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,820
Next slide.

144
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:19,981
So more on housing strategies and initiatives that we've undertaken along the way.

145
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:23,604
The city, as I mentioned before, is amending the zoning.

146
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:27,647
They're looking at potentially building on some city-owned lots.

147
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:40,917
They're looking at facilitating housing development in partnership with nonprofit organizations and with the Medford Housing Authority redeveloping some of its properties.

148
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:49,429
and the um yes yes yes thank you for coming yes thank you

149
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:16,401
I'm just providing some context right now talking about things that the city has been doing that this effort, this affordable housing trust is contributing to.

150
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:19,782
The city is also looking at ways of supporting households.

151
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,663
No, no, please make yourself comfortable.

152
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:32,045
and advocating for affordable housing.

153
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:32,986
Oh, thank you, Lisa.

154
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,167
That should be open anyway.

155
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:44,154
So these are, and I've highlighted on this slide, some items in purple.

156
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:52,900
I hope that you can see the difference between purple and black that are things that the affordable housing trust may be.

157
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,183
The screen.

158
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:57,890
Oh, exactly that.

159
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:18,099
So the items that are in purple are things that the Affordable Housing Trust may be able to provide some leadership, take some initiative to do some of these things.

160
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:27,065
That includes building on city-owned lots, potentially facilitating the development of affordable housing in partnership with

161
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:48,246
nonprofit organizations, providing support to households with down payment assistance, rental assistance programs, housing rehab programs, and identifying additional sources of revenue so that we can expand the money that is available to support affordable housing.

162
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:55,128
So those are the kinds of policies that we are looking to for to decide.

163
00:15:55,765 --> 00:16:00,006
on a direction of what this group is going to focus on.

164
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:09,349
So some highlights of the data that we found in the process of preparing this report, some really interesting things.

165
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:14,451
The first is that Medford's population has grown from 2010 to 2022, it grew by 11%.

166
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:17,432
And really interestingly, most of the age groups

167
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:35,026
There was some growth among seniors, but other age groups, like children, older adults were kind of flatlined over this time.

168
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:45,714
The largest growth that we received over that period was young adults, ages 25 to, or ages, I think, 20 to 35.

169
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:56,287
We gained 4,000 young adults over that period, really remarkable growth.

170
00:16:58,443 --> 00:17:07,692
And most of those were in non-family households, a growth in roommate households over this period.

171
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:17,362
So I just included this picture on the left that I swear is a picture of my new neighbors who moved in last year.

172
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:22,027
It's just so representative of the new neighbors who we're seeing moving into Medford.

173
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:30,674
There has been a slight increase in people of color and immigrants in Medford over this period of time.

174
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:39,742
Smaller proportion than statewide of people with disabilities in the city.

175
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:44,826
And that could be because of the quality of housing units that we have.

176
00:17:45,186 --> 00:17:49,310
We don't have housing units that really accommodate people with disabilities.

177
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:50,876
Sorry, we were late.

178
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:52,517
Oh, that's okay, welcome.

179
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:55,278
We were looking for a park, sorry.

180
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:57,520
Next slide.

181
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,723
So the next we look at what does Medbird's housing stock currently look like?

182
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:06,765
This slide, and it's a very complicated graph.

183
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:10,808
I encourage you to look at it in the report and spend some time with it.

184
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:18,172
I don't know how well you can see it in the presentation, but there are hard copies of the report if you want to,

185
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,348
to take a look at it more closely.

186
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:25,149
Our housing is diverse.

187
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:32,833
We have all the different colors on this chart are representing different types of housing that we have.

188
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:37,555
Single family, two family, three to eight family is the dark pink.

189
00:18:38,175 --> 00:18:42,277
Nine plus units, large apartment buildings is the purple strip.

190
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:45,218
Light green is condominium.

191
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:52,990
And then orange is public housing, and there's a thin strip of just other housing.

192
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,311
This comes from Medford Assessor's data.

193
00:18:55,791 --> 00:19:00,832
And you can see the bars represent a period of time when the housing was built.

194
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:04,453
So the largest share of our housing was built 1900 to 1920.

195
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:11,690
And that's also when we had the most diverse type of housing being built.

196
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:22,900
Over the 20th century, the housing development dropped significantly, and especially the small multifamily, the more diverse housing,

197
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:30,122
Styles dropped away over the 20th century, and we've increased again.

198
00:19:30,142 --> 00:19:39,805
And since 2000, we've seen more housing development with a large increase suddenly in large apartment buildings, which we weren't having before.

199
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:44,067
So our housing is diverse, tends to be old.

200
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,328
The housing units are large.

201
00:19:46,468 --> 00:20:09,495
We saw that there are more housing units across the city that have two or more bedrooms and a lot of households of single person households and people, roommates who would probably like to have their own apartments but have to combine because our housing units are larger.

202
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:12,376
And our housing is very expensive.

203
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:24,620
I can get into how expensive the housing is in a bit, but we've seen really significant increases in housing cost in the last 10 years.

204
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,280
Go ahead.

205
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,743
So who is struggling with the housing costs in Medford?

206
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:39,048
Around 5,500 households are below 50% of area median income.

207
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:53,659
Area median income is a measure that's created by the federal government that looks at for different sizes of households, what is the median income in the region in which we live?

208
00:20:54,123 --> 00:20:57,865
which for us, that's the Boston region.

209
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:06,689
So 50% of the median, that means you're below half of what the average household is.

210
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:16,373
And we have about over 5,000 households that are below that 50%, of whom two thirds are housing cost burdened.

211
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:21,395
Housing cost burdened means that they spend more than 30% of their income on housing.

212
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:25,376
a large number are spending more than half of their income on housing.

213
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:31,199
So 33%, a third of all homeowners are over the age of 65.

214
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:37,541
And the median income for seniors over the age of 65 is $44,000.

215
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:48,165
That means we have a very large population in Medford, a large share of very low income homeowners in Medford.

216
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,860
which is kind of a unique situation that we see.

217
00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:00,926
So that being the case, seniors are experiencing the highest rate of cost burden in Medford.

218
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:08,405
Median household income, meanwhile, for renters has been rising rapidly.

219
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:14,387
And that likely reflects what it requires to move into Medford.

220
00:22:14,907 --> 00:22:21,008
So as the rents go up, it requires a higher income to be able to afford those rents.

221
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:26,209
And that means that the median income of renters is going up really quickly.

222
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:28,510
And that's a reflection of displacement.

223
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:37,908
households with lower incomes are being displaced and moving out of Medford, and so they're not reflected in our median income levels.

224
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:48,194
And I've got another even more hard-to-read graphic on here, but it's a really fascinating graphic.

225
00:22:48,254 --> 00:22:51,819
Again, I encourage you to find this in the plan.

226
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,168
But in this graphic, the bars represent different industries that people work in in the Boston area.

227
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:01,113
the vertical bars.

228
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:08,038
The horizontal bars represents what it costs to have a house in Medford.

229
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:11,440
The orange bar represents home ownership.

230
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:22,168
There isn't a single industry in the Boston region where the average wage is sufficient to buy a house, the average house in Medford, with a single income.

231
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:28,673
So it requires multiple incomes at the average wage to be able to buy a house in Medford.

232
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:34,358
The red horizontal bar represents the cost of rent in Medford.

233
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:39,943
And we can see that it's at the very bottom it says 64% of jobs are in a bracket

234
00:23:47,857 --> 00:24:00,220
In fact, only 29% of jobs can easily afford to rent an apartment at market rate in Medford on a single income.

235
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:07,862
The rest struggle to be able to rent an apartment or they have to combine with roommates to be able to rent an apartment.

236
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:16,345
On the leftmost, we can see the green line is the cost to rent a room in Medford.

237
00:24:16,385 --> 00:24:20,507
The average room rental price is $1,000 a month, and there are

238
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:42,096
Many jobs in the arts and recreation, food service and hotel industries who struggle to be able to afford a room at the average wages in those industries.

239
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:43,977
So it's very telling.

240
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:48,059
ahead.

241
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,923
So switching gears a little bit talking about like what is affordable housing?

242
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:58,408
What is it that the Affordable Housing Trust is here to to address?

243
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:08,778
So naturally occurring affordable housing is housing that's less expensive than typical market rate units, but it's not protected or guaranteed.

244
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:24,057
Very often it happens to be naturally affordable because it's been owned by the same person for such a long time that their mortgage is paid off and they haven't had to make an investment in the property in a long time.

245
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:40,871
And then there is capital a affordable housing, which is defined as housing that should cost less than 30% of the income of households who earn below a specific level that area median income that I described earlier.

246
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:48,313
And the rent for an affordable housing unit is typically below market rent.

247
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:57,587
So this is the area that the Affordable Housing Trust is trying to provide assistance to developers to create affordable housing.

248
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:04,656
Then we also have some other types of affordable housing that the city is addressing.

249
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:17,241
Inclusionary or 40 B development provides some affordable units in mixed income developments through zoning or through permitting that requires

250
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:22,583
some of the units to be affordable while other units are market rate.

251
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:36,568
And then there's subsidized housing, which is predominantly what the housing authority provides, where a portion of the rent is covered through government funding, and the rent is always based on income.

252
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:44,822
And just to provide some context of what we mean by area median income, go ahead to the next slide.

253
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:52,608
I provided just as an example what the income limits for affordable housing were this year.

254
00:26:52,668 --> 00:26:55,590
So 100% of area median income for a family of four

255
00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:00,184
would be $148,900.

256
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,166
And so looking at different household sizes, 80% of area median income

257
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:20,071
that for a three person household would be just over $100,000 a year.

258
00:27:20,511 --> 00:27:35,974
So that is the income that, um, the maximum income to be able to access affordable housing that the, uh, that the housing trust would likely be, um, the funding.

259
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:38,335
Go ahead.

260
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:46,530
And so we looked at what does the subsidized housing inventory look like that the city has today?

261
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:50,534
We have just over 2,000 affordable housing units in the city, which is 8.12% of our total housing stock.

262
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:52,795
Of these, 851 are public housing units.

263
00:27:52,815 --> 00:27:55,157
That's the Medford Housing Authority.

264
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:14,752
There are 700 project-based Section 8 housing units.

265
00:28:16,814 --> 00:28:26,180
The households have a Section 8 voucher, which means that they pay 30% of their income, but the units are in a privately owned building.

266
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:54,983
About, I think a little over half of the units that are counted in that 700 are actually affordable and some of the units that are counted are not affordable because the way that the state counts units on the subsidized housing inventory allows some market rate rental units to be included if a majority or if a percentage of the units in the development are affordable.

267
00:28:56,845 --> 00:29:02,228
We have 289 units that are in 40B.

268
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:11,455
They're under the process of being permitted to build mixed income housing developments through

269
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:17,000
the state's comprehensive permit or 40B process.

270
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:28,310
Those units haven't actually been built yet, so that 289 units, only 25% of them will be affordable, and none of them exist at this moment.

271
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:37,839
170 units are in mixed income developments that were created during the pandemic.

272
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,658
by development agreements.

273
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:45,141
When those developments were built, the city asked them to provide some affordable units.

274
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:47,503
So we have that's where those come from.

275
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:53,667
30 units are owned and managed by nonprofit affordable housing organizations.

276
00:29:54,307 --> 00:30:00,051
And there are 49 units that are for people with disabilities that are administered by the state.

277
00:30:02,132 --> 00:30:06,495
And there are also many about

278
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:21,946
Just under 1,000 mobile housing vouchers that the Medford Housing Authority administers, which are not counted in our subsidized housing inventory because they're held by the household.

279
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,810
They're not attached to the housing unit.

280
00:30:28,282 --> 00:30:36,005
And we also looked at what are the funding resources that are available right now for affordable housing in Bedford.

281
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:46,209
The Community Preservation Act, as I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation, provides some funding that's available for affordable housing.

282
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:56,614
It generates about $2 million a year, and that is spent on affordable housing, open space and recreation, and historic preservation.

283
00:30:57,194 --> 00:31:00,159
So it's split between those three different purposes.

284
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:06,167
Over eight years, the city has spent about $4 million on affordable housing.

285
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:13,058
So about a quarter of the CPA funds have been spent on affordable housing.

286
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:20,899
And the CDBG is federal funding the city receives that can be spent on affordable housing.

287
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:25,980
It's used to help low income households in a variety of ways.

288
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,521
The city receives about $1.4 million a year in CDBG federal funding.

289
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:38,483
And also we're part of a consortium of communities that receives 2.3 million in total

290
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:42,324
split between eight communities.

291
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:44,384
That's all for affordable housing.

292
00:31:46,665 --> 00:31:47,085
Thank you.

293
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:49,405
So that's all of the data.

294
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:50,526
That was a lot.

295
00:31:50,666 --> 00:32:01,249
I apologize for so many words, but I'm going to pass it back to Penny to talk about what we learned and what we concluded.

296
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:03,135
Thank you.

297
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:05,277
Thank you so much, Roberta.

298
00:32:05,578 --> 00:32:06,759
And thank you all for being here.

299
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:10,342
So this is why we're here tonight to show and share our action plan.

300
00:32:10,923 --> 00:32:14,246
And of course, we considered all the data and information that we just went over.

301
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:20,632
But just to remind you all, we had focus groups with stakeholders, developers and service providers.

302
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:25,597
We had a public meeting in March where we kind of presented the same data and just kind of asked generally,

303
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,666
What people wanted in or it was really generative conversation and then took all that edited together.

304
00:32:31,926 --> 00:32:34,749
And now we're very excited to present this to you tonight.

305
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:35,610
So, 1st off.

306
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:42,937
One part of our action plan was solidifying the mission statement of our affordable housing trust because it's brand new.

307
00:32:42,997 --> 00:32:46,480
So we needed to make sure we had our guiding principles down.

308
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:58,149
So our mission is to create and preserve community housing, including affordable home ownership and rental opportunities and other forms of housing assistance for low and moderate income residents in Medford.

309
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:00,010
Next slide.

310
00:33:00,443 --> 00:33:05,824
All right, so we have the mission statement, we have some goals, and then we have our course of action.

311
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:08,785
So just to go over some of our goals.

312
00:33:09,785 --> 00:33:19,388
Promoting a welcoming, diverse, intergenerational, and inclusive city with a mix of housing choices that offer diverse options to residents with varying needs and preferences.

313
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:31,661
Use financial and property resources to address the local housing needs and meet production goals established in the housing production plan and to preserve the affordability of existing affordable homes.

314
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:35,783
The naturally occurring affordable that we mentioned is in mind here.

315
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:40,646
Foster safe, well-designed, accessible and sustainable housing.

316
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:44,028
Integrate affordable and diverse housing options throughout the city.

317
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:59,741
Our goal is to expand local capacity to implement housing initiatives by building partnerships with mission-driven organizations and developers seeking to build affordable housing and to increase communication about housing resources across the community.

318
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:06,145
So you all being here, we hope to continue that conversation and that communication with everybody.

319
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:09,708
So we have some priority actions.

320
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:21,113
We want to support building affordable housing in partnership with mission-driven organizations and developers seeking to build affordable housing as well as the Medford Housing Authority.

321
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:27,215
We will preserve and convert existing housing to long-term affordability.

322
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:31,936
We will support existing homeowners and first-time home buyers.

323
00:34:32,957 --> 00:34:40,179
We will fund housing stability programs and we will prioritize funding for units affordable to households with lower incomes.

324
00:34:42,274 --> 00:34:43,295
We have some more prior.

325
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,137
There's a lot of work to do.

326
00:34:45,157 --> 00:34:48,900
We will build a relationship with the community preservation committee.

327
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:53,325
As Roberta mentioned, that's a lot of the funding for affordable housing in the city has come from that source.

328
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,687
So working closely with the CPC.

329
00:34:57,405 --> 00:35:04,372
and advocate for affordable housing development and policies that maximize the resources available to meet our city's housing needs.

330
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:18,847
So this includes exploring and acting upon funding opportunities for the trust, working with developers to build support and navigate the approval process, work with partner organizations to establish programs that meet local needs,

331
00:35:20,063 --> 00:35:29,635
supporting initiatives that expand tenant protections and stabilize existing tenancies, and to provide guidance on affordable housing projects funded through the CPA program.

332
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:36,782
So as I mentioned, all that came out of all the conversations that we've been having and the data we're looking at.

333
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:42,807
I did mention revenue sources because that was echoing something that's already come up in this meeting.

334
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:46,890
What we heard over and over again, there's a lot of interest in building affordable housing.

335
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,592
There's not a lot of money to build affordable housing in Medford.

336
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:50,833
So we heard that a lot.

337
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:59,040
So some potential revenue sources, we have anticipated resources, including the Community Preservation Act, which we have already secured $300,000 for the trust this past year.

338
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:11,808
inclusionary zoning ordinance, linkage payments, and negotiating payments from developers are all on the table.

339
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:29,259
Other potential sources that have either been recommended or that we are exploring, pilot, which is a payment in lieu of taxes for nonprofit, large nonprofits, appropriations of funds, special ordinances,

340
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:46,930
voluntary donations and contributions from individuals, loan payments and resale of affordable units, affordable housing resale fees, other municipal revenues, a real estate transfer fee, and sale of city-owned properties.

341
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,313
So just a few examples that came up over the course of our conversation.

342
00:36:55,397 --> 00:37:05,663
So we just presented a lot of data to just like, here's what we hear we need to do in our long list of goals and items that we are really eager to take action on.

343
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:09,906
And there's some next steps in this process.

344
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:20,352
So first off, you being here, seeing this presentation, taking some time with the plan, reflecting and letting us know what's missing or what you think needs to change.

345
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,162
We're taking comments until August 7th.

346
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:30,988
So you have about a week to reflect on this and get back to us and let us know, because you're the community that we're serving, right?

347
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:38,814
Once we get comments and finalize that action plan, we're gonna present it to the city council in September.

348
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:43,878
All of this, we have a website and all this information updates will go on our website.

349
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:49,563
So we don't have the date for the city council yet, but we would sure love to see all of you there supporting our plan and our work.

350
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:54,284
Um, we do meet every month on the first Wednesday of the month.

351
00:37:54,464 --> 00:37:55,906
Actually, we have August off.

352
00:37:56,007 --> 00:38:03,878
So, uh, there's a bit of a false alert, but starting September, we'll be back at it on the first Wednesday of every month in this very room and online.

353
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:04,740
So please,

354
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:09,315
continue to join us, continue to be part of the conversation and the work that we're doing.

355
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:10,816
Cause that is how we will succeed.

356
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:23,663
To that end supporting initiatives when they come up, you know, if there is one of those potential funding sources is a conversation and city council, we'd love to have you join and help build that support.

357
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:28,366
So we can, we can make all this happen and keep Medford affordable.

358
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:33,869
And then if you want to get involved, we actually do have an open seat on our affordable housing trust board.

359
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:39,308
I believe the links to our website, I think it's on the flyer.

360
00:38:39,328 --> 00:38:43,489
Yeah, and coming up there are some other links as well.

361
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:46,170
But, you know, this room is comfortable.

362
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:52,572
If you like being here on this Wednesday evening, we certainly invite you to apply because we're currently accepting applications.

363
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:58,823
And at this point, we want to open it up to questions.

364
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:05,345
Obviously, it's a hot day, there's a lot of information, but we're eager to hear from you and folks online as well.

365
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:08,967
Please let us know questions.

366
00:39:09,665 --> 00:39:11,606
And then it looks like you're about to say something, Catherine.

367
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:12,166
Pass it to you.

368
00:39:12,546 --> 00:39:17,048
One thing I just wanted to say, we have some new folks in the room and potentially on Zoom as well.

369
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:24,850
So at the start of the meeting, we asked if people wanted to fill out a survey just to see who's in the room, who's participating in this discussion.

370
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:30,492
So are you able to just... Okay, so in the chat, we just dropped it in.

371
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,233
You can share the...

372
00:39:33,095 --> 00:39:35,616
code with everyone later if you want to do QR code, but.

373
00:39:35,636 --> 00:39:42,519
Can you just flip back to that slide?

374
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,439
Yeah.

375
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,282
It was that one.

376
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:48,582
Yeah.

377
00:39:48,942 --> 00:39:57,606
So that's the, you can use the QR code or that shortened link, and then it'll take you directly to the survey.

378
00:39:57,626 --> 00:40:00,407
If you want to fill that out, we would love to get that information from all of you.

379
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:00,907
So thank you.

380
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:12,416
So this is the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

381
00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:17,479
My name is Lisa Davidson and I'm the chair of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

382
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:41,928
Beside you is... I'm Tanya Taylor and I'm currently vice chair of the trust.

383
00:40:42,548 --> 00:40:44,109
And I'm Roberta Cameron.

384
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:49,794
I'm a member of the Affordable Housing Trust and I'm also a member of the Community Preservation Committee.

385
00:40:49,814 --> 00:41:01,764
So, and there is the, I'm not sure if you were here when I was giving a little breakdown of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, but there are seven members on the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

386
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:04,547
One is the mayor, one of the mayors is me.

387
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:14,599
somebody from the Community Preservation Committee, as well as five, if I do my math right, yeah, five Medford residents.

388
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:21,943
And I do believe we have at least one other trustee on, attending the meeting today.

389
00:41:21,964 --> 00:41:24,445
Yes, yeah.

390
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:25,586
Yeah.

391
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:27,867
Hi, hello, I'm Kayla Wesson.

392
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:31,649
Sorry, my internet's a little spotty, so I've tried to keep my video off.

393
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:35,583
But I'm Kayla Lesson, also a trustee on the board.

394
00:41:36,944 --> 00:41:38,284
Thank you, Kayla.

395
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:44,286
And we didn't take off this live show because we had such a hard time getting it back on.

396
00:41:44,426 --> 00:41:45,487
No, fair, fair.

397
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:47,707
Thank you.

398
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:53,549
Sorry, do any of the current members fall under, like, underrepresented categories?

399
00:41:53,749 --> 00:42:00,812
I find persons of color and disabled are recipients of what we call the telehealth allowance.

400
00:42:03,015 --> 00:42:05,236
Yes, there is there.

401
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:12,880
I don't know if it's broken out, like, how many seats that are supposed to be on actually preparing for today.

402
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,082
I went back to the to our declaration.

403
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:20,777
double check to see, like, are there designated seats assigned?

404
00:42:20,898 --> 00:42:22,679
And I didn't see that.

405
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:23,519
I could be.

406
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:24,280
I could be.

407
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,082
I think the I think it lists qualifications that they're looking for.

408
00:42:29,443 --> 00:42:35,727
And so that includes people who have certain types of professional experience, lived experience.

409
00:42:37,107 --> 00:42:38,448
So it's looking for both.

410
00:42:39,008 --> 00:42:39,869
Oh, crap.

411
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:42,551
No, I believe the board members live in.

412
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:43,491
Oh, yeah.

413
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:48,278
But as we said, we're looking for another person.

414
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:56,005
So if you are interested in joining, joining the trust, there is, I think applications are.

415
00:42:56,025 --> 00:42:56,165
Yeah, so.

416
00:42:59,373 --> 00:43:04,976
I think we have the link later in the presentation, but also my email is at the end as well.

417
00:43:05,036 --> 00:43:07,917
So if anyone has questions, I'm Katherine Buckingham.

418
00:43:08,057 --> 00:43:10,539
I'm a housing planner for the city of Medford.

419
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:17,382
My email is listed, but it's kbuckingham at medford-na.gov.

420
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:19,443
So email me with questions.

421
00:43:19,483 --> 00:43:22,445
I can provide you with links or the forum or whatever.

422
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,246
So please reach out.

423
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:28,968
Do you want to advance to the slide that has the bathrooms that I'm getting from?

424
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:32,643
Should I look around some more?

425
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:34,664
It's going to be lots of questions.

426
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:36,665
Yes, at the very end.

427
00:43:37,566 --> 00:43:39,367
And I do see a bubble in the chat.

428
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:43,810
OK, we have a question here, too.

429
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:44,430
So maybe.

430
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:47,092
And there's a question on the chat.

431
00:43:47,112 --> 00:43:47,532
Is that?

432
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:50,253
I think it was just someone coming into the meeting.

433
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:50,533
All right.

434
00:43:50,633 --> 00:43:54,094
It looks like there is something in the chat, but in the meantime, maybe we can take a question from.

435
00:43:54,114 --> 00:43:56,774
Yeah, the chat just has the links that we shared.

436
00:43:56,874 --> 00:43:57,135
Oh, OK.

437
00:43:57,175 --> 00:43:58,115
So people can put.

438
00:43:58,315 --> 00:44:08,637
If anybody out there in hybrid land has any questions, please use your, raise your hand and we're happy to call on you as well.

439
00:44:08,657 --> 00:44:11,417
Do you want to go ahead?

440
00:44:11,457 --> 00:44:16,078
So, do you use it in bringing this action from your school

441
00:44:16,648 --> 00:44:21,309
The one can be here, online, or in the city.

442
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:36,151
And I, for myself, have been flying mostly since 1999 with my dad, when he gave the lecture for New Year's.

443
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:46,253
And you also own a business called Mystic Arts, which is the patient flying school.

444
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:53,415
And all my siblings are seven of us, even before.

445
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:58,417
And, you know, I'm quite influential.

446
00:44:58,977 --> 00:45:02,578
And now I'm raising my four boys.

447
00:45:03,538 --> 00:45:06,519
And I want to stay here.

448
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:13,141
I want to be buying things to buy from here.

449
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:15,802
And so, in a way,

450
00:45:16,723 --> 00:45:19,804
when it comes to income-wise.

451
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:28,126
And even though I live in the housing now, I can't afford it.

452
00:45:28,966 --> 00:45:38,048
And even though I work for jobs, they say, okay, I still can't afford it also.

453
00:45:39,188 --> 00:45:45,370
And every year when they do the assessments,

454
00:45:46,106 --> 00:45:49,248
to renew my lease, they cut off.

455
00:45:50,689 --> 00:46:14,843
If I tell you that I live in a public housing, I'm paying $2,062 every month, people would think that because I live in a public housing that I live for free with my four kids, people would never believe that I pay that amount of money every month.

456
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:19,981
And most of all, food-wise, buy everything.

457
00:46:20,061 --> 00:46:26,184
And then all the activities you put the kids in is also expensive.

458
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:44,154
But one thing I want from this thing is to make it more convenient for young people, persons like me, that because I want to stay in Medford,

459
00:46:44,724 --> 00:46:53,128
And then, because my kids, they, you know, this was a fun day, things were easy with friends and school kids.

460
00:46:53,588 --> 00:46:58,850
But if I moved down to another city, now the culture is tough for them.

461
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:59,430
Yeah.

462
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:07,734
Because the way we can take the orange line, the red line, it's so accessible and really convenient.

463
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:11,835
But I'm planning to move somewhere else because

464
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:27,688
I can't, since I don't have the, or the big fan where you have the house and dog and all the perfect life.

465
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:33,410
It's not that perfect if you have soul anyway.

466
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:42,252
And one question I have is that, who can, how you can believe,

467
00:47:43,788 --> 00:47:58,753
openly from applying to this funding, what do someone like me need for that grant?

468
00:47:59,773 --> 00:48:01,954
And how would I use it?

469
00:48:02,014 --> 00:48:04,095
And where would that be accepted?

470
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:12,238
Because most people, when they say, oh, you have a grant, they probably think, oh, it's not that opulent to them.

471
00:48:14,585 --> 00:48:18,588
Could you repeat the question too when you answer just for folks on Zoom?

472
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:19,468
I just want to make sure.

473
00:48:19,508 --> 00:48:23,390
Thank you for sharing and the struggle is real, right?

474
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:28,033
Even when living in subsidized housing, such like the Medford Housing Authority.

475
00:48:29,294 --> 00:48:33,476
The question, as I understand it, please correct me if I'm wrong, is,

476
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:49,034
some background story where you are looking, you're probably moving, you're looking to moving, you want to stay in Medford, your perfect world would be to purchase a home here in Medford, correct?

477
00:48:49,535 --> 00:49:00,600
So the question as I understand it is, how could you or anybody come to apply for funding through the Affordable Housing Trust Fund

478
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:06,101
to help you meet your goal of becoming a first-time homeowner?

479
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:07,321
That's the question.

480
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:08,782
Thank you.

481
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:11,103
And that's a great question.

482
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:16,845
And we are in the middle of starting up.

483
00:49:17,105 --> 00:49:17,965
It's been a year.

484
00:49:18,725 --> 00:49:23,247
We have limited funds right now.

485
00:49:24,147 --> 00:49:29,509
The action plan right now is kind of looking at development housing.

486
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:30,930
We are talking about

487
00:49:31,366 --> 00:49:35,808
of programs and assisting people like yourself to purchase a home.

488
00:49:36,388 --> 00:49:38,889
However, we're just starting out.

489
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:42,771
We haven't really worked out those processes yet.

490
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:54,636
There may be other resources available to you through other agencies that are funded through the CPA or the CPC.

491
00:49:56,236 --> 00:49:59,918
And I unfortunately don't know those off the top of my head.

492
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:03,559
but we can try to get you that information.

493
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:13,087
If you reach out to Catherine, who's emailed contacts there, and if there are resources, she could certainly share those resources with you.

494
00:50:13,607 --> 00:50:15,529
Did I?

495
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:28,639
I could just add that if a person is looking for assistance with moving into a rental unit in Medford,

496
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:38,840
It could be somebody who's currently a Medford resident looking to relocate in Medford or someone who lives outside of Medford looking to rent an apartment in Medford.

497
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:47,966
The Community Preservation Committee right now funds a program that's managed by ABCD.

498
00:50:48,627 --> 00:50:56,152
So someone can apply through ABCD for move-in assistance for first and last month's rent.

499
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:09,868
a person who is having experiencing a rental, you know, maybe in danger of eviction, who has rental arrears.

500
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,151
Housing Families, Inc.

501
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:19,957
has a program to help prevent homelessness.

502
00:51:20,501 --> 00:51:22,981
by paying those rental arrears.

503
00:51:23,882 --> 00:51:29,322
And so those are two programs that the Community Preservation Committee funds right now.

504
00:51:29,943 --> 00:51:30,883
Thank you, Roberta.

505
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:46,925
I'm hearing that need and also the need for clarity around application when it's ready and what someone does to access, especially when we talked about different programs of supporting first-time homebuyers and things like that are what we want to be able to do.

506
00:51:46,985 --> 00:51:49,766
But they're not quite set up yet, but certainly

507
00:51:50,853 --> 00:51:53,854
Thank you for affirming that that is one of our goals.

508
00:51:56,316 --> 00:52:02,899
Before I take, I see a second chat up there and I assume it's not something that we put in the chat.

509
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,700
Is there a question?

510
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,782
I think, yeah, sorry.

511
00:52:10,783 --> 00:52:15,345
Okay, so the question says, can you send me the presentation?

512
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:19,787
And then is there a city councilor who has

513
00:52:20,424 --> 00:52:23,667
taking an interest in the issues I should talk to.

514
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:29,011
I don't know if you guys have thoughts about sharing the presentation and also.

515
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:33,936
This is a public meeting, so all the materials should be made available.

516
00:52:34,156 --> 00:52:40,101
I think they do get posted on the Affordable Housing Trust Fund's website.

517
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,952
Am I speaking out of turn?

518
00:52:42,152 --> 00:52:47,234
Well, we can definitely post them online, the way we share, like meeting minutes and things like that.

519
00:52:47,314 --> 00:52:51,936
And I'll double check the process if it goes directly onto the Trust Fund website.

520
00:52:51,996 --> 00:52:54,617
But regardless, we can make sure we post it.

521
00:52:54,757 --> 00:53:01,780
And also, for the person who left that comment, again, feel free to email me, too, if you want to make sure you get it sooner than later.

522
00:53:02,187 --> 00:53:08,431
Did we leave, did we put the link to the plan in the chat at the beginning?

523
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:13,855
So a person who joined late might not have seen the link to the plan in the chat.

524
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:18,738
Yes, so we just shared the link again.

525
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:22,941
So there's the link for the plan and then also the link for the survey.

526
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:24,402
Those should both be in the chat.

527
00:53:24,642 --> 00:53:25,502
Perfect, thank you.

528
00:53:26,223 --> 00:53:27,464
And you had a question.

529
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:30,586
I did, so my team, my partner, Sully,

530
00:53:31,396 --> 00:53:39,641
Actually, really quickly, if you're willing, it would be great if you might be able, because I know the people online can't hear you.

531
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:40,662
Oh, OK.

532
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:41,722
Maybe I still bring this over.

533
00:53:41,742 --> 00:53:44,864
I'm sorry, what was your name?

534
00:53:45,124 --> 00:53:46,585
My name is Susan.

535
00:53:47,046 --> 00:53:47,566
Oh, Susan.

536
00:53:47,586 --> 00:53:47,946
Susan.

537
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:51,288
My parents also moved to Medford when I was in college.

538
00:53:51,308 --> 00:53:55,951
I actually grew up in Kingridge, and I can kind of remember.

539
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:17,075
as somebody who works as an educator, and I don't know if the panel is like sort of prioritizing this, is you talk about like natural affordable housing being made available, but sort of the issues that are happening with affordable housing were definitely, you know, over time historically engineered.

540
00:54:17,135 --> 00:54:23,438
So for instance, if there's like an awareness, for example, like of the racial makeup of the city of Medford in that,

541
00:54:23,811 --> 00:54:28,775
there is a reason why there are less children, less families who can't afford to live in Medford.

542
00:54:28,815 --> 00:54:33,099
And a lot of us are either living in apartment buildings or moving out of the city of Medford.

543
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:47,092
The fact that there's a lot of like non-family or roommate households, you know, being because of the building of the transportation and the expansion of the MBTA system, the colleges and universities, a lot of the tech jobs, for instance.

544
00:54:48,336 --> 00:54:57,923
And I know some of these issues are like bigger than Medford because you don't necessarily make up like the area median income, you know, those are more like federal numbers.

545
00:54:58,484 --> 00:55:14,917
But if we're looking like at the census and what people actually make in the city, that map that you're showing as far as what is considered affordable, if I'm working as an educator, if, you know, I'm owning a small business, if I'm, you know,

546
00:55:15,418 --> 00:55:21,803
working as a waitress, I can't afford any of that with three children or two children or whatever the case is.

547
00:55:22,023 --> 00:55:31,790
And then also even further back, like, you know, with redlining in Massachusetts, when my parents first looked for a house, the first house that they looked for, the owner would not allow him in the household and called him an N word.

548
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:35,653
And, you know, he was with a white realtor that was in 1999.

549
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:39,676
So that person very possibly, you know, benefited.

550
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:42,519
And this is why we have an elderly population in

551
00:55:43,447 --> 00:55:56,610
Medford who is making $44,000 a year and a homeowner because they were able to benefit off of the history of redlining that excluded people that look like myself and that look like Woodland, some of the people in this room, maybe some of the people on this chat.

552
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:09,653
So all of that to say that, you know, as much as like we can, or the panel can say, or even some of the shareholders and organizations, I myself, a recipient of affordable housing,

553
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:13,974
I do notice the difference, you know, I live in a mixed income unit.

554
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:21,401
I do notice the difference when myself goes into the leasing office versus, you know, my dog-owning neighbors that are paying, you know, $5,000 for their unit.

555
00:56:23,022 --> 00:56:30,869
There is definitely a dynamic that happens with that kind of experience.

556
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:34,933
So as much as I know there's maybe some good faith efforts and

557
00:56:35,507 --> 00:56:46,172
you know, sort of the bird's eye view, but when we kind of look through the weeds and at the roots, there's other issues besides just sort of wanting it to happen.

558
00:56:46,192 --> 00:56:55,376
There's a lot more, I think, engineering, I would hope, that is also a part of the conversation and intentionality in addition to the money, of course.

559
00:56:56,076 --> 00:57:00,138
So that's all I wanted to ask is whether some history is a part of that, too.

560
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:01,218
Thank you.

561
00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:02,319
Thank you.

562
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:04,520
And I want to, this is not,

563
00:57:05,058 --> 00:57:09,979
necessarily purview of this presentation, but just something each of you has said.

564
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:20,742
The state has a strong fair housing office and something that you mentioned of someone turning down a subsidy or funding that you got, that's illegal.

565
00:57:20,782 --> 00:57:22,963
We have a source of income discrimination law.

566
00:57:23,003 --> 00:57:24,784
So just to say that there,

567
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:40,809
There also are state offices of fair housing that, you know, I think raising in front of, like, for example, when I applied to my unit, I was told that I didn't have ideal credit.

568
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:46,472
And I had to pay an additional $600 security deposit to get units.

569
00:57:46,492 --> 00:57:51,835
So it's not that they said no, but say, for instance, I didn't have the resource of getting

570
00:57:53,054 --> 00:58:03,539
$600 cash on hand, in addition to the security deposit, the first month's rent, and being able to keep upkeep, I would have lost that affordable unit, if that makes sense.

571
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:04,119
It does.

572
00:58:05,059 --> 00:58:15,944
So those are ways that they, you know, it's like a fancy way of redlining without saying you as a low income person, you as a single mother, you as a black person cannot rent here.

573
00:58:16,304 --> 00:58:18,565
They make it inaccessible by saying,

574
00:58:19,142 --> 00:58:24,523
you as somebody who does not have access to more liquid assets, if that makes sense.

575
00:58:24,823 --> 00:58:25,584
It does.

576
00:58:26,364 --> 00:58:35,826
And we're hearing that a lot of when people are doing credit scores or credit checks, when they're looking for their housing.

577
00:58:36,406 --> 00:58:46,769
And I know that there is a big effort in places that are trying to disband or stop

578
00:58:49,137 --> 00:59:05,086
going in for credit checks because it is, or could be, I should rephrase that, could be a form of discrimination because there are a lot of black and brown people, minorities, that have poorer credit scores than they may not have.

579
00:59:05,106 --> 00:59:12,690
They're not just minorities, but yeah, it's not like, I don't want this to be framed as people that are

580
00:59:13,254 --> 00:59:16,637
descendants of Africans or descendants of Latin America that we all have that credit.

581
00:59:16,737 --> 00:59:18,778
Yeah, that's not me.

582
00:59:18,818 --> 00:59:20,179
Yeah, that's more.

583
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:33,509
Yeah, I don't want that generalistic thing, but it's more that, you know, it could very possibly be that the other applicant, you know, didn't have that offer because I didn't see that anywhere in the lease or any part of it in that $600.

584
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:35,330
I don't know where it went.

585
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:40,054
It definitely wasn't a part of my security deposit cachet, if you will.

586
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:49,263
And then even for parking, for instance, after three years, suddenly parking was being charged 150 every month when the first three years it was free.

587
00:59:49,704 --> 00:59:58,270
That's another instance in where the market rent, you know, for them, they're making $200,000, you know, working at Google, it's a drop in the bucket.

588
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:08,037
But if we're a part of the affordable, you know, portion of units, that $250 a month for a parking spot is a lot of money.

589
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:17,290
So again, thinking about these more intricate details, we're slowly becoming, I don't know, New York, pretty much.

590
01:00:18,211 --> 01:00:20,332
Nancy was pretty smart, except for that entrance.

591
01:00:20,632 --> 01:00:23,314
But sorry, we want to get all the questions over to everybody.

592
01:00:23,334 --> 01:00:26,055
Thank you.

593
01:00:26,075 --> 01:00:27,136
Did you have another question?

594
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:27,236
Yeah.

595
01:00:27,596 --> 01:00:28,917
So I have two questions.

596
01:00:29,017 --> 01:00:31,878
I don't know if you guys will be able to do it.

597
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:33,399
I am a member of the Maha.

598
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:38,382
Maha, when you said October 7, which is the group of

599
01:00:40,430 --> 01:01:04,095
African-Americans who create this affordable housing system where you take a class with them, I did, and you receive a certification that allows people to get funding from

600
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:34,760
SASH, different, like, last week I went to a open house for housing with a bunch of senators of Beacon Hill, where Mayor Woon was there, and Josh Puff, the new, wanted to be the next mayor of Boston,

601
01:01:35,957 --> 01:02:00,311
Maha is pretty diverse and especially Medford needed diverse, different culture of other ways to learn or maybe listen what's going on when it comes to buying or renting.

602
01:02:00,991 --> 01:02:04,033
Maybe if you listen to Maha groups,

603
01:02:04,948 --> 01:02:05,688
I have contact.

604
01:02:06,148 --> 01:02:08,149
I can give it, I can share it with you guys.

605
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:29,074
So maybe that can give you an idea how you can benefit people that live in Medford, that want to stay in Medford, or how you can collaborate with them to, because I know they're open, because with Medford, they get

606
01:02:29,547 --> 01:02:44,131
community, even though there is a lot of funding that has been distributed to Dorchester, where people that live in Dorchester are supposed to stay in Dorchester, but they're using that funding to stay in Boston.

607
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:49,813
But because Medford is a gay community, Medford cannot get that funding.

608
01:02:51,124 --> 01:02:54,987
because I asked, because they cannot fund me because I live in Medford.

609
01:02:55,327 --> 01:03:08,916
If I need to get that fund, I have to stay, live away from Medford, go to Boston City, go to the Boston where they entered that category, but ask me in the gay community.

610
01:03:08,936 --> 01:03:14,620
So me, if I gay, they're not going to fund me or her or anybody else that live in Medford.

611
01:03:16,241 --> 01:03:17,042
If you want to,

612
01:03:18,245 --> 01:03:22,248
have a conversation with the group of people.

613
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:47,305
They're very nice, and they will listen to any needs Medfone might have, or they might open the affordable food Medfone, and at least, like, anybody can afford, but there's a $3,000 maximum you need to have in your account if someone need to

614
01:03:48,246 --> 01:03:50,609
have this funding.

615
01:03:51,009 --> 01:03:51,930
There's more to it.

616
01:03:51,950 --> 01:04:04,925
I don't know if this group needs to listen to the panel more and learn about it, how Medford can bring MAHA into Medford City.

617
01:04:04,945 --> 01:04:06,547
At M-A-H-A?

618
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:06,827
Yeah.

619
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:26,238
I would like to learn more about that, whether, I don't know if it's something that the Affordable Housing Trust could partner with, or it's something that I'd like to just learn more about in general, about how we can advocate for more partners to work in Medford.

620
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:39,102
Because Somerville wasn't in it, but now, because Somerville now is more diverse in it, so now they just add Somerville into it, and now they're trying to bring MedModern

621
01:04:39,677 --> 01:04:58,307
and with the population of Asian and more than, now they want to sweep that opportunity to bring the Asian community where they can have more house everywhere, every part of the Massachusetts, so.

622
01:04:58,868 --> 01:05:02,310
Yeah, I would like to exchange contact information.

623
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:08,173
I don't know if that's a good idea, because I work at Tufts, been working there for like

624
01:05:09,033 --> 01:05:24,440
Since like 14 years, my ways never really grew up, even though I wrote down letters after letters saying, I started this, I'm doing this, I'm doing that, I'm doing that.

625
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:27,602
I did several ways, but no one was listening.

626
01:05:28,722 --> 01:05:37,907
What about if the City of Melbourne, people that work in different areas, so City of Melbourne, if I work for you,

627
01:05:38,473 --> 01:05:52,162
they should be able to pay me certain leaving that meant for Muslim equal to the rent or the to buy housing.

628
01:05:52,182 --> 01:06:05,150
I don't know how that going to work, but that's what I'm doing, that they make the place to work for pay more taxes so that they can afford to

629
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:10,789
to distribute the funds to people that need to buy housing and this and that.

630
01:06:11,069 --> 01:06:11,509
Yeah.

631
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:19,214
On our list of potential funding sources, one of the things that was mentioned was pilot payment in lieu of taxes.

632
01:06:19,674 --> 01:06:22,036
And that's exactly what you just described.

633
01:06:22,496 --> 01:06:31,361
If Tufts, a large nonprofit institutional employer, if they were to

634
01:06:32,877 --> 01:06:46,146
increase the amount of money that they voluntarily give to the city of Medford, specifically to the Affordable Housing Trust, so that that would help to provide funding for housing for their own employees.

635
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:51,610
I just looked it up the same thing in my textbook.

636
01:06:54,992 --> 01:06:56,193
Do we have someone online?

637
01:06:56,233 --> 01:06:57,614
Is that a question in the chat?

638
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,816
It's a comment from Teresa.

639
01:07:01,536 --> 01:07:02,357
OK, great.

640
01:07:07,017 --> 01:07:20,544
So Teresa shared Medford move-in program administered through ABCD and funded by the Community Preservation Act, which helps with first slash last rent for income eligible folks moving to or within Medford.

641
01:07:20,645 --> 01:07:23,266
And then she shared the link to that organization.

642
01:07:23,586 --> 01:07:28,449
For those in the room, if you want to talk to me afterwards or email me, I can share that link.

643
01:07:29,676 --> 01:07:44,776
And then also she shared another resource, Housing Families, administers Medford's Rental Arrears Program, which assists income-eligible Medford residents with back-to-rent slash facing eviction, also funded via CPA, and that's housingfamilies.org.

644
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:56,439
And I also wanted to acknowledge Councilor Ferris, who has joined us, and that reminded me of a question that came up, I think, online of which city councilors folks should get in touch with about this.

645
01:07:56,779 --> 01:08:01,202
And I would say all of them, because we need support of everybody.

646
01:08:01,222 --> 01:08:02,862
We want everyone to be on board with the plan.

647
01:08:03,263 --> 01:08:05,904
So I would encourage just to follow up with that question.

648
01:08:05,924 --> 01:08:14,749
And the mayor does sit on our board as well, but it's always great to hear from supporters of this plan and our efforts.

649
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:15,309
So thanks.

650
01:08:17,078 --> 01:08:17,498
Thank you.

651
01:08:17,919 --> 01:08:19,440
Just wanted to say that.

652
01:08:23,783 --> 01:08:24,624
Any other questions?

653
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:36,753
I don't know why, because I think the ABC doesn't work.

654
01:08:37,393 --> 01:08:44,399
I, myself, sit at a payco right now with Medford Housing.

655
01:08:44,739 --> 01:08:46,120
I went to court with them.

656
01:08:47,066 --> 01:09:02,529
And even though there is a stipulation where they have a program, each time, each month, when you pay your rent, they put something into an escrow.

657
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:10,230
And the escrow, after five years, you can get that escrow.

658
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:15,131
It's been five years, and then the amount of the money

659
01:09:15,573 --> 01:09:16,873
They got the NDS school.

660
01:09:17,733 --> 01:09:19,454
It's my account.

661
01:09:19,794 --> 01:09:27,735
It's so past what they supposed to receive, maybe 5,000 because they charged me a lot.

662
01:09:28,355 --> 01:09:32,656
And now it getting into a long amount.

663
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:36,297
So now they owed it, that money.

664
01:09:36,537 --> 01:09:39,177
They supposed to be giving it this month.

665
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:42,258
They still not holding it because I

666
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:50,819
all that money because I have to pay before I can get that money.

667
01:09:50,839 --> 01:10:04,762
And without giving them the lowest amount that I owe them, they will still hold that money until I finish paying.

668
01:10:05,002 --> 01:10:07,403
It doesn't begin to be five years from now.

669
01:10:08,483 --> 01:10:12,144
I might be still, they still holding that money.

670
01:10:12,887 --> 01:10:16,469
that money, it could be doing me a good favor.

671
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:29,215
I told them, why don't you minus what I owe and then give me the rest of that money so that I can just put it down on a house?

672
01:10:30,136 --> 01:10:32,577
And then Medford would benefit from that money.

673
01:10:33,037 --> 01:10:35,058
But Medford Housing still holding it.

674
01:10:36,459 --> 01:10:42,162
And if I do not have the money to pay what I owe, even though I'm paying the rent, which is

675
01:10:42,874 --> 01:10:51,279
almost $3,000 plus an additional of the money that I owe, which is $200 added to that.

676
01:10:51,299 --> 01:11:05,027
And then even though when I get my income tax, I put all the money down, it's still, I think there's no way the interest is going to go down because it's still the same thing.

677
01:11:05,688 --> 01:11:05,928
So,

678
01:11:08,447 --> 01:11:13,590
So, you know, and then I applied for ABC, they didn't approve me.

679
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,671
I don't know why.

680
01:11:16,211 --> 01:11:33,601
Because if I did receive that ABC, that will give me a greater amount to reduce that and get that money from the housing so that I'm able to afford it to at least put it down for hours or something like that.

681
01:11:33,621 --> 01:11:35,342
So I don't want to lose that money.

682
01:11:36,699 --> 01:11:42,843
Because that's a bit of money that I might never be able to have it again.

683
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,585
But it's not in my hand, but it's closed in the bank.

684
01:11:45,765 --> 01:11:47,727
And then I cannot get it.

685
01:11:48,727 --> 01:11:49,708
Can I say something?

686
01:11:50,288 --> 01:11:55,192
So basically that account is called an FSS account.

687
01:11:55,712 --> 01:12:02,137
And if it's the same as the sum of them, it's like, let's say you start your rent at $99, just an example.

688
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:06,974
And then you get into that program, whatever.

689
01:12:07,435 --> 01:12:12,355
Every time your rent goes up, that amount of money goes to that account.

690
01:12:12,436 --> 01:12:12,976
It's yours.

691
01:12:13,516 --> 01:12:15,876
So after five years, they have to give it to you.

692
01:12:16,256 --> 01:12:17,997
But they don't give it to you like in your hand.

693
01:12:18,537 --> 01:12:22,337
They put it into a bank and like a CD account.

694
01:12:22,537 --> 01:12:25,218
And after three months, you can do whatever you want with that money.

695
01:12:25,858 --> 01:12:28,519
That's how it's supposed to be.

696
01:12:28,539 --> 01:12:29,819
What I wonder is whether

697
01:12:31,438 --> 01:12:42,862
housing families rental arrears program might be able to might be able to Jeff is the lawyer when we went to court with him.

698
01:12:42,882 --> 01:12:48,724
He's the one who said that you work so hard because they know that I have no time.

699
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:55,567
He says you work so hard I cannot see myself let them take that money from you.

700
01:12:56,548 --> 01:13:18,352
yeah with your four kids and stuff like that i've been paying more than five years and then they still holding is like more than eighty thousand dollars in the bank so um they've been holding and then i'm afraid to get a lawyer to family case because i don't know because you know i'm a female uh with no

701
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:30,262
see if they'll order and I don't know if they're gonna erase your profile that's why they owe their money because it's too much for them to give it to me back you know what I mean?

702
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:48,285
store well that could be a case that's why I'm here that's why I'm here because I need to know what to do I know you can advise me on any of this but at the same time I don't want that money to get wasted is there like a person that works for housing that you sit down with

703
01:13:48,827 --> 01:13:51,567
like, and he saw them?

704
01:13:51,607 --> 01:13:57,989
Yes, I have a great deal of, um, um, um, uh, can be white nigger.

705
01:13:58,349 --> 01:13:59,489
She's a very good lady.

706
01:13:59,529 --> 01:14:03,269
She's working so hard to finally get me that money.

707
01:14:03,289 --> 01:14:10,351
But there's this lady called, whatever her name is, um, she's unlimited.

708
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:16,472
Don't want to give me that money because she said, um, there's one, there's a one white lady.

709
01:14:16,532 --> 01:14:18,392
I don't know if she has something against me.

710
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:21,911
but she doesn't want to release that phone.

711
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:33,535
Yeah, she's the one who hold that, because I'm not alone, but I know Sandy always call me, let me know what's going on with my case.

712
01:14:34,756 --> 01:14:45,680
Sandy is retired, moving to another location, but before she moved, she wanted to give me that money, but she's still, because she has not,

713
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:51,001
did that, really owning their account hostage.

714
01:14:51,341 --> 01:14:52,841
It's actually the problem, we think.

715
01:14:53,141 --> 01:15:00,343
I mean, not this exact story, but like, it's not, um, it's the story of White House.

716
01:15:00,363 --> 01:15:03,124
I'm so sorry about that.

717
01:15:03,164 --> 01:15:03,484
I do think

718
01:15:08,101 --> 01:15:13,567
Greater Boston Legal Services does cover Medford and they have an intake line.

719
01:15:13,587 --> 01:15:19,693
You could call and see if they can take this case or if they have any other recommendations that would be free.

720
01:15:19,713 --> 01:15:27,961
Just an idea that might be good to consult with them.

721
01:15:28,722 --> 01:15:29,423
Yeah, right.

722
01:15:29,743 --> 01:15:30,764
I think you should go.

723
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,441
Thank you for sharing this story.

724
01:15:38,461 --> 01:15:54,872
It's really hopeful for all of us to understand what kinds of housing issues people are encountering so that we can have a better understanding of how to prioritize the resources that we have.

725
01:16:05,815 --> 01:16:07,436
Are there any other questions?

726
01:16:11,459 --> 01:16:14,121
Again, we want to thank you all for coming out tonight.

727
01:16:14,161 --> 01:16:15,141
Thank you for sharing.

728
01:16:15,201 --> 01:16:16,803
Thank you for your questions.

729
01:16:17,563 --> 01:16:31,773
Please, there is a link on the chat as well as if you do this QR code here, brings you to this, I'm sorry, the Medford Affordable Health and Trust Fund.

730
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:38,034
that will have the action plan as well as Catherine's contact.

731
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:41,478
So if there's any other questions, we're looking for comments.

732
01:16:41,558 --> 01:16:44,141
So please, thank you.

733
01:16:44,161 --> 01:16:46,343
Thank you all very much.

734
01:16:46,724 --> 01:16:47,164
Thank you.

735
01:16:55,419 --> 01:16:56,060
Recording stopped.
