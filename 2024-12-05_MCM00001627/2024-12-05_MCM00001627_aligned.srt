00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:08,917
Welcome to the Bedford Brooks Estate Land Trust board meeting, October 17th, with some of us in attendance and some of us to join soon.

2
00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:19,144
Usually we start off by reviewing the secretary's minutes, but this evening we are not because we don't have a copy of that at the moment with our secretary traveling.

3
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:24,588
But luckily, we have Mark filling in for us as secretary this evening.

4
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:29,411
So Mark, thank you so much for capturing tonight's notes so we can review them next time.

5
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:30,591
No problem at all.

6
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:37,834
We have a packed agenda, and I would like to keep us on track to finish by 830 if we can.

7
00:00:38,694 --> 00:00:43,196
But, of course, I want to create space for adequate conversation for each of these items.

8
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:47,338
There are some that I think will warrant some deeper conversation as well.

9
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:52,120
So I'm going to keep us moving along where I see fit, but unfortunately we will need to

10
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:54,375
dig into some of these things.

11
00:00:54,595 --> 00:01:01,717
So we are going to cover the police call box donation that Medford or arts collaborative Medford has requested of us.

12
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:10,319
We chatted about that by email, but we will make a formal motion to donate that today and then submit the terms for that.

13
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,940
We're also going to chat a little bit about our support from the city of Medford.

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,400
We had a call yesterday.

15
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,742
Doug and I had a call with the mayor and we have some updates for you all after that phone call.

16
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:25,204
We will share our financial update.

17
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:31,830
I have a snapshot that I will distribute after this meeting by email as well, but I'd like to give you an understanding of where we are with our finances.

18
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:45,864
We have an update to the manor caretaker resolution that we're working through, and we'll also be talking about the admin position that we've been seeking an admin for, so welcome, Alba, for that.

19
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:50,927
We have a couple of upcoming projects that I would like us to take a look at.

20
00:01:50,947 --> 00:02:00,450
This was originally the intention of this board meetings focus area was for us to dig into where the money is coming from for upcoming projects, especially the access drive.

21
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:04,032
So I'd like to spend a little bit more time working on that.

22
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:05,052
That's why that's highlighted.

23
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:06,913
Doug just texted me.

24
00:02:08,873 --> 00:02:09,393
All right.

25
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:11,674
And Zoom.

26
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,652
And I'm going to call him on his cell and see if we can get him in here as well.

27
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:24,754
And then we will have.

28
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:37,619
A little bit of an update for you on the winter prep on the manner work that we went in front of city council for last week and ask them for a little bit of money there.

29
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,420
So I'll have an update.

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,161
So packed agenda.

31
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,082
Is there anything else that immediately needs to be talked about?

32
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:55,004
Not immediate Carly, but we might want to add a standing item to the agenda for like grant updates, just because I know we'll be doing more on that.

33
00:02:55,064 --> 00:03:03,069
So I know at our historical commission meeting, we kind of have like standing, we have like new business and then we have old business that kind of is the same every month.

34
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,289
So just an idea.

35
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:11,414
That sounds awesome, and I think that's perfect timing to bring that up because we did actually just bring on a new volunteer.

36
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:17,961
Nancy Carbone is helping us with grant research, and I see she's already been creating a spreadsheet and putting some things in there.

37
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:22,365
So I think it would be great to have her come to some of our meetings and share what she's been finding as well.

38
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:29,612
And then any things we've applied for that we're seeking status on and then executing projects against.

39
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:30,353
Yeah.

40
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,640
Love it.

41
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,120
Okay.

42
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,982
So let's talk about that police call box donation.

43
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:40,385
We do have the request from the arts collaborative Medford crew.

44
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:46,548
They would like to have the call box that is in the carriage house currently at the Brooks estate.

45
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,289
Yes, he is here.

46
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,250
Wonderful.

47
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,109
Great.

48
00:03:53,130 --> 00:04:07,817
So they made the request, they would like to refurbish it and turn it into an installation where you can sit in the call box, pick up the phone and listen to stories from history, which we think is just really lovely.

49
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:14,200
And of course, from what we've heard from you all on email so far, everyone thinks that's a wonderful idea.

50
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,663
And Mark came up with the especially great idea that we should tell them a yes,

51
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,348
as long as they include Brooks' estate history in their stories.

52
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:35,320
So we would like to put forward a motion to officially say yes to donating that call box over to Art Collaborative Medford.

53
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,982
So can somebody make a motion please?

54
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,884
I'll make a motion to support the project.

55
00:04:40,964 --> 00:05:00,328
And one thing I want to just point out in reading the, you know, since I was working on the grants for ourselves last week, I noticed that any project that is somebody is putting in and there's like support from somebody else, they're probably going to be looking for a letter from us an official letter of support.

56
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:06,029
So we might just want to prepare that in like a brief letter of support of the project and send it to them.

57
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:08,230
So they have it for their grant application.

58
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,971
That sounds great.

59
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:11,491
We can definitely do that and.

60
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,093
John, do you feel like that's something you can draft and run by the rest of the board?

61
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:17,994
Yeah, I can probably start it.

62
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:23,177
And then even if we add to it, that's fine, but just even having someone get it started would be great.

63
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:25,338
Thank you.

64
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:26,718
So, okay, John made the motion.

65
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:28,859
Do I have a 2nd 2nd?

66
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,120
Wonderful all in favor.

67
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,180
Hi.

68
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:35,182
Great.

69
00:05:35,522 --> 00:05:36,863
Doug, it's great to hear your voice.

70
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:41,726
Thank you so much for troubleshooting well at 1 o'clock in the morning, 1.20 in the morning.

71
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:42,147
Hi, Doug.

72
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,428
Good morning, everyone.

73
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:45,048
Hello.

74
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:46,229
Good morning.

75
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:49,892
I hope you're having so much more fun than the rest of us in LA.

76
00:05:54,711 --> 00:06:01,875
We have not yet reached our new agenda item of the update of support from the City of Medford.

77
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:07,278
We, of course, just knocked out the police call box item, so we're ready to move on to that.

78
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,061
I'm going to provide a little context, Doug, but I would love to have you fill in anything that I missed.

79
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:12,861
Does that sound okay?

80
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:14,942
Good.

81
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:15,583
Sounds good to me.

82
00:06:15,603 --> 00:06:15,823
Thanks.

83
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:37,831
All right, so this meeting that Doug and I had yesterday came about on the heels of conversations that we've been having via email about the manor caretaker and our efforts to make sure that we transition him to his next home well in joint collaboration between M-Belt and the city.

84
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:44,514
We have been working via email with the mayor and with her attorneys.

85
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:58,621
KP Law is the law firm that has been advising the mayor on the work from the city side, and we have been looking to them to help us with some legal guidance for how to proceed with this.

86
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:04,925
We've been asking them for meetings to talk about this as it has continued to be

87
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:16,948
Not progressing, unfortunately, in the way that we had hoped, and we hadn't gotten a chance to meet with KP law, but we did get a request from them earlier this week.

88
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:21,629
KP law reached out to us by email and said, mayor has requested a meeting.

89
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:26,230
With M belt and KP law so that we can clarify.

90
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,170
what we're all doing.

91
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,751
So I was on that call.

92
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:32,792
I asked for that call also to include Doug.

93
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:34,953
So luckily Doug was able to join me for that.

94
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:43,376
And essentially what we learned during that meeting is KP Law is retained, of course, by the city of Medford and they represent Medford.

95
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:52,439
We as MBELT are a separate entity, nonprofit entity that we do not have representation support from KP Law.

96
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,440
And KP Law also feels as though

97
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:08,705
The agreement that was signed by the caretakers seven years ago under which they originally entered the property and their work was not signed by somebody at the city of Medford.

98
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:16,228
So Medford feels as though they do not have involvement in the caretaker issue that we are facing.

99
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:23,291
And they advise us to seek our own counsel and find our own routing for solving that.

100
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:40,558
What we learned during that meeting was there's a distinction being made by the City of Medford between what the City of Medford needs to do and what we as Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust needs to do.

101
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:48,219
They believe the caretaker issue that we are working through right now is solely an M-Belt issue and not a City of Medford issue.

102
00:08:49,300 --> 00:09:01,648
And with that, they have also opened the conversation for us to be separate entities, and they have reminded us of some of the things that stand in the original 1997

103
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:24,835
agreement when Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust was founded and named as managers of the estate, that they feel like we are in need of doing more things like being a landlord for the estate and paying utilities and taking care of the estate in a deeper way and paying for maintenance.

104
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:31,476
So I'm going to pause there for Doug to fill in anything that I might have missed in that general overview of our call.

105
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:48,097
Yeah, I can only say that this call was stunning, is the only word I can use, because it flew in the face of the last 25 years, basically, of what we've been doing.

106
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:54,439
And Carly and I were texting during this call, like, this sounds surreal.

107
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:54,999
The city is clearly

108
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:06,587
trying to use the lawyer legalese to get themselves out of a situation with the caretaker.

109
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:16,354
And they're essentially trying to divorce themselves from Ambelt over this one issue, which is insane, obviously, on its face.

110
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:22,898
And we have to push hard back on this, obviously, as much as we can, because there's

111
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:36,371
There's no way M-Bell can function if they think that we're a separate identity and we have our own insurance and our own, you know, like a separate system that has simply not been true for the last quarter century.

112
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:45,037
So we push back on this, you know, and it's clearly become a political issue for the mayor.

113
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:51,622
She doesn't want to be seen, and she said this on the call, she doesn't want to be seen evicting a 70 plus year old man

114
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:54,195
out of a city-owned property.

115
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,597
Politically for her, that's a bad look, and we understand that.

116
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:12,905
I think we can deal with her political concerns without actually blowing up the larger relationship, which we're trying to get closer to the city of Medford, and now they're using this to try to draw a hard line between.

117
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:15,927
It's not in the spirit or the letter of the original agreement.

118
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:18,989
I think there's a lot of proof to that.

119
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:20,770
I was thinking about this,

120
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:25,042
in the last day or so since the call.

121
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:29,603
And if they're going to go down that route, we're going to have to basically revisit the agreement.

122
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:50,150
I think that's our only other than applying political pressure to alter the original agreement and get them back in line because it's just what they're proposing is politically unacceptable and unacceptable on many levels because we simply don't have the resources

123
00:11:51,682 --> 00:12:02,628
that the city of Medford does and the partnership that we've done for the last 25 years has been something and now they're basically saying it's basically nothing.

124
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:05,249
I don't know if there's any other way to say that, Carly.

125
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,013
Yeah, no, it's true that I think you used the word divorcing themselves from us and it's true.

126
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:15,335
They feel as though this is our problem and they have nothing to do with it and they

127
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:20,506
are trying to just remove themselves, so.

128
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:31,869
And if you think about it, they still, I mean, Mark Rumley from the city that solicited at the time, he wrote the agreement, you know, the idea that they have nothing to do with this just because they did not sign it.

129
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:38,931
And Tom Lincoln signed it on behalf of M-Belt, which is, yes, the acting landlord for a city-owned property.

130
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:44,733
I just don't even think it stands up on the legal front very well.

131
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:52,696
Again, given the history here, KP Law signed the letter that Carly and I delivered to Stephen back in July.

132
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:56,457
Is KP Law formerly known as Koppelman and Page?

133
00:12:57,938 --> 00:12:58,798
Not sure, actually.

134
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,279
I may know one.

135
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:00,819
I could find out.

136
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,680
Do you know the name of the attorney who was dealing with this?

137
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:06,101
Nicole Costanza is her name.

138
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:07,502
No, I don't know her.

139
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,654
I used to know several of them.

140
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:18,040
See, after working at the city's law department, it's not unheard of for people to shift over to Koppelman and Page.

141
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,143
They're standing in-house counsel to a lot of cities and towns.

142
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:25,966
And I used to know quite a few people there.

143
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,448
But I don't know Nicole.

144
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,990
What's her last name?

145
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,751
I'm looking this up.

146
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:34,472
Estanza.

147
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:35,913
Estanza.

148
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:39,862
Yes.

149
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:42,844
Yeah, thank you for doing that.

150
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:47,887
I know I've been sitting on this information for what's that Audrey?

151
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:49,028
Costanza?

152
00:13:49,848 --> 00:13:50,108
Yeah.

153
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:52,090
Nicole Costanza.

154
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:58,113
It's under KP law, but I searched it as Koppelman.

155
00:13:59,254 --> 00:13:59,814
Wait a minute.

156
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:02,216
I've been sitting on this information.

157
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:02,336
Okay.

158
00:14:05,498 --> 00:14:19,747
So yeah, this has been about 24 hours that I've been processing all of this and it still feels fresh and it still feels, I have some severe emotional reactions to all of this, of course, and I'm sure you all might as well.

159
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:28,512
I would like, the way that we left it yesterday with the mayor and her attorneys, we said, we're not solving anything today.

160
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:38,638
I would like to review our agreements, especially the original 1997 document that they referenced to draw the hard line that they felt they needed to draw.

161
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:50,225
And I want to review that, and I would like for us to consider how we're going to fight this, because we cannot just roll over and

162
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,920
I think we have to look at this as two separate things.

163
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,503
I think the first and foremost is the caretaker situation.

164
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,243
Absolutely.

165
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:06,908
I think maybe we do, you know, get counsel and deal with that ourselves.

166
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:15,373
And then once Steven is out, then we have that because then there's no risk for the mayor.

167
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:15,813
Right.

168
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:21,117
Like if he's out and we've done it, then then it's a win that we've delivered.

169
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:24,544
Yeah, and it's it's less liability for her.

170
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:28,284
And then, you know, if that takes, I mean, it could take a year.

171
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:33,426
I mean, this time next year, she's either running for another term, or she's not.

172
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:34,366
Right.

173
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:44,148
And then so like our why are we going to waste our time with her when she might not even be in office a year from now or deciding not to run and then we have to deal with the next

174
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:55,132
You know, I think if we kind of let it lie a little bit on the city's part, like, I think we just might need to deal with the caretaker situation separately.

175
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:55,952
Okay.

176
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,456
That would be my take, because I think it's too much of a big...

177
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:08,541
Like, she's obviously got a lot on her plate dealing with these questions and the political ramifications of all that.

178
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:19,065
Obviously, from a budget standpoint, we have big issues in this city that I think, you know, it's easy for her to say, I can't support you guys at all.

179
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:19,845
I don't have the money.

180
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:21,686
I don't have the legal resources.

181
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:34,317
And I feel that might just be like a gut reaction until we know where the city falls on some of this stuff that will obviously take, we'll know in three, four weeks what's going on.

182
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:35,599
So I don't know.

183
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:36,740
That's my take on it.

184
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:43,306
I 100% I appreciate that Jim, but I 100% disagree because I think

185
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:50,196
This is the beginning of the end of them belt, but we don't have the resources to fight this, right?

186
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:54,459
We just don't and to accept their report.

187
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:58,442
We can take Steven off the plate and deal with this separately.

188
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:00,164
Steven can stay there for 6 to 12 months.

189
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:00,984
It won't be.

190
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,386
We can manage that, right?

191
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,048
But we can't manage the city.

192
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,821
walking away from this.

193
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:24,708
And I think we can walk the line with the mayor and saying, look, we're going to deal with Stephen just as we can, but we cannot allow what I believe is a complete abdication of their responsibility, even more than they've done since the beginning of MBEL.

194
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,271
They're literally trying to, they're shutting us down, essentially.

195
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:34,593
If they refuse to help us, if they refuse to deal with something that they helped create,

196
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:42,992
And we can prove that, you know, we're going to have to, I think we need to re-engage them, but take Steven off the plate and just focus on the relationship.

197
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:48,994
Because if we accept their, their thesis, we're cooked if we don't have the ability to do this.

198
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:53,096
And I don't think it's fair for them to do this.

199
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:59,978
Like legally, I know if KP got involved in this and they looked purely at the agreement, you know, and look, no,

200
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,493
I haven't read the Ministers Agreement in more than a decade, right?

201
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:15,302
And I'm sure there's language in there that is vague and unclear, right, about what exactly the relationship between the M-Belt is and whose responsibility this is.

202
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:23,890
But we can clarify that and, if necessary, change that relationship based on the last 25 years of precedent.

203
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:39,843
You know, if the city has been paying for giving us legal advice and legal support for 25 years and suddenly decide not to, that's a precedent that they cannot, no matter what the agreement says, I don't think they can walk away from.

204
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:47,105
And politically, I mean, I don't know what Zach said, but we'll get the call to start dealing with this.

205
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:52,367
But the political, if she thinks she has a political problem with evicting one man,

206
00:18:53,678 --> 00:19:01,723
You know, out of the—the political problem of undoing a quarter century of Imbecile's commitment is going to be a bigger political problem for her.

207
00:19:01,743 --> 00:19:05,246
I don't want to say that to her face, but that's the reality of it.

208
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:07,047
I don't want that to be the case.

209
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:17,081
And without M-Belt as an entity, the conservation land is still conservation land no matter if we're here or not as a nonprofit entity.

210
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:21,926
So without M-Belt, the conservation piece of it falls to the city.

211
00:19:22,086 --> 00:19:23,608
And so we're relieving a burden.

212
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:26,230
We provide value in our structure and what we bring.

213
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:32,556
And I think the strongest argument that we can make to provide value for ourselves or to show our own value

214
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:50,195
is to be able to build up this core of what we do and take the burden off the city, which is what we've been meaning to do all along and have done in so many ways, but really showing that concrete value so that it's not seen us.

215
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:52,858
We're on opposite sides.

216
00:19:53,739 --> 00:20:00,045
One thing I'd like to point out is they're asking, the city's asking us to be a landlord for their property.

217
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:02,047
They're not telling us that they own it.

218
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:07,553
So what happens this winter when we don't pay the utilities?

219
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:14,599
Stephen gets cold, he goes to housing court and he sues the school and belt of the city.

220
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:18,009
Good question.

221
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:32,641
Yeah, and this is actually part of the conversation we had yesterday with KP, as they said in the original managers agreement, it is required that the managers hold your own insurance and then list the city as an additional insured under our insurance, which is the first that I had heard of that.

222
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:39,587
Of course, I know I'm new, so I'm hearing a lot of things for the first time, but that was surprising based on what I know our precedents as well.

223
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:43,576
I didn't know how to fight it in the moment.

224
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:47,380
So this is part of the processing that we're gonna have to really delineate and come back with.

225
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:56,067
Where are we at with, I'm assuming we're getting $0 for the manor maintenance that's needed.

226
00:20:57,116 --> 00:21:07,401
So the manor maintenance that's coming up for winter, the $55,000 that we went in front of city council and asked for, the resolution was approved out of appropriations.

227
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:20,006
I haven't connected with Zach yet to see what the distribution and disbursement of that money actually looks like, but that is promising for that particular set of projects.

228
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:23,788
However, the utilities is another piece because we...

229
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:29,482
They've stopped paying the security fee.

230
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,763
They've stopped paying ADT.

231
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:38,247
We got a notice from ADT that they're about to shut off security because the bill hasn't been paid by the city, even though the city has always paid the bill on security.

232
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:39,488
We have never paid the bill.

233
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,870
The electricity and the oil and the telephone.

234
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,371
We're paying the telephone right now.

235
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:48,112
We're playing electricity right now.

236
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:53,135
We don't have another oil delivery scheduled, but when we do, we will need to pay for that as well, probably.

237
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:54,396
We got a...

238
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:14,837
that the mayor has allocated some of the departments of building, part of his budget will be dedicated to paying for utilities in fiscal year 25, which is next calendar year.

239
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:19,038
However, that does not cover anything for us until the end of the year.

240
00:22:19,658 --> 00:22:25,300
So that's a tiny bit of a concession, but that still means the security, who knows, is probably going to get shut off.

241
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,041
I would let it get shut off.

242
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:29,125
Yeah, I would let it get shut off.

243
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:30,926
Yeah, just cancel it.

244
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:32,227
Yeah.

245
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:37,929
Yeah, I think we need to again, I think, take a step back here.

246
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:40,750
Think about, you know, what's.

247
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,332
We've been trying to reengage the city and say, you need to do more.

248
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:46,812
You need to give us a budget for the building.

249
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:47,993
You need to stop kind of.

250
00:22:49,915 --> 00:23:06,626
trying to push this entire 50-acre property onto a bunch of volunteers who don't own the property and are expected now to pay for it and somehow maintain it with money that we raise from grants and foundations.

251
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:09,327
No one pays for maintenance.

252
00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:16,572
It doesn't stand on its face legally for two seconds by anyone looking at it beyond the precedent.

253
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:26,812
So I think, again, I don't want to play into their hands and accept their, and we told them this on the call, this is simply not the way it's been done.

254
00:23:27,732 --> 00:23:40,598
And if we get a lawyer involved, it's not going to be to solve a Steven problem, it's to go after the city of Medford for what they're trying to do.

255
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:42,479
I think there's

256
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:55,548
It's just not a path forward for us if they're starting to wall themselves off from us and wash their hands of the estate and inbound.

257
00:23:55,568 --> 00:24:02,609
It's politically unacceptable and they have to be told that in some fashion.

258
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:13,452
I don't know the right tool and I'm not looking to throw sand in the mayor's face at all, but this is something we have to

259
00:24:15,475 --> 00:24:18,996
reject in the strongest legal language possible.

260
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:27,699
Maybe Mark, you could, and all of us should take a look at the original agreement.

261
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:35,942
Yeah, Mark, I was curious if you might be able to point us in a direction of where we should go with this.

262
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:43,964
I'm not asking you for your professional time, but I think it would be helpful for you and your skills to at least let us know what your thoughts are.

263
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:47,920
Yeah, I've got an attorney in mind if we do decide to go that route.

264
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:51,643
But first, could somebody give me a copy of that 97 agreement?

265
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:52,864
Absolutely.

266
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:54,726
And I'll read it over first.

267
00:24:56,187 --> 00:25:01,671
Doug, we might, maybe Ed Weiss can help us with a read of it as well.

268
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:02,491
He's pretty good.

269
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:06,034
Yeah, I was thinking that too, on the commission.

270
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:08,015
Yeah, we can ask Ed to help us.

271
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:09,837
He's on the historical commission with us.

272
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:12,379
And just a lovely human.

273
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:15,417
and smart as a whip attorney.

274
00:25:16,237 --> 00:25:25,962
Can I ask, this might sound naive, but did you feel like the city is trying to bully us out of business?

275
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,204
Do they have other plans?

276
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:31,585
No, it's not that.

277
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:32,966
I don't think it's that complicated.

278
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:33,606
Okay.

279
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,307
Because they own the property.

280
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:36,067
They're just trying to run.

281
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:38,128
They have to have some responsibility for it.

282
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:39,069
Right.

283
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:40,377
Right.

284
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:48,220
And they said multiple times during that call that they were coming to us in the spirit of collaboration and in partnership and in teamwork.

285
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:51,161
Not necessarily what I felt, but that's what they said.

286
00:25:51,221 --> 00:25:55,823
So I'd like to remind them that they said that in future conversations.

287
00:25:55,943 --> 00:26:00,245
And I would like to approach this from, we have joint interests.

288
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:07,888
We are going to take care of certain things so that you don't have to worry about it, but we cannot do this in the way that you think we are going to do this.

289
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:13,620
I think this is kind of a knee-jerk reaction, and I think, again, I—

290
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:16,688
I hear you, Doug.

291
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:20,149
I don't disagree with you after hearing what you've said.

292
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:26,331
I do think that we need to divest to the caretaker situation from this other piece of it.

293
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:34,474
And I think if we can, maybe if we can separate out and go back to her and say, listen, we're gonna deal with this.

294
00:26:34,914 --> 00:26:39,515
We're not asking you to, we're not asking you for any fallout of that.

295
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,856
But we do need continued support over here.

296
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:44,017
Maybe that's the way to go.

297
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:47,729
My initial intention, sorry, go ahead, Doug.

298
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:49,790
No, you go ahead, Carmen.

299
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:57,194
Well, I've been thinking about this anyway, and now I'm especially thinking about this maybe in a more narrowly focused way.

300
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:12,304
I've been wanting to go to the mayor with a budget that we've created for ourselves, with a fundraising plan that we have for the next fiscal year, with a set of laid out projects that we know we're going to accomplish over the next 12 months.

301
00:27:12,904 --> 00:27:18,993
I want to go to the table having those things in hand so that we can highlight, here's what we know we can do.

302
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:21,416
Here's the gap of what we know we can't do.

303
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:25,261
And those things would be the maintenance of the building.

304
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:29,634
City-owned property, what do you do for other city-owned properties?

305
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:38,001
Let's take that precedence, let's apply it here, and let's make sure it's all-encompassing taken care of with delineation of who is responsible for what.

306
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:44,166
That's what I hope to go to the mayor with in January, maybe, I don't know, as soon as we can get it.

307
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:49,610
I think that's good, because I think that

308
00:27:51,212 --> 00:28:00,139
if we can show what the, and my prediction is that those kind of monthly things are much less than they think it might be.

309
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,040
Right.

310
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:03,662
We're not asking for $60,000 a month.

311
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:03,883
Right.

312
00:28:03,903 --> 00:28:05,444
We're asking for 200, maybe.

313
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:05,564
Yeah.

314
00:28:14,037 --> 00:28:15,619
Yeah, I think that's a good plan.

315
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:23,611
I think that if you're right, if we can show some action and progress and like, listen, hey, we're like, it's a new group here.

316
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:24,772
We're a new path forward.

317
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:26,335
We're like super excited.

318
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:28,217
And this is what we're going to do.

319
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:36,289
I think there's a little hesitance for me in saying, we're new, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to.

320
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:43,532
I need to have a firmer plan, especially for her and her legal brain, that she feels like it's actually accomplishable.

321
00:28:43,552 --> 00:28:45,373
And it's not just pipe dreams.

322
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:55,057
Because I think that's one thing that I'm worried about, even for my own perception of coming in as this young, energetic, new president, whatever, that it's like, oh, isn't that cute?

323
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,597
Like, no, we're actually doing this shit.

324
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:58,658
This is really important.

325
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:02,198
What does the city do for, say, the library?

326
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:10,840
Do they, you know, put it on the friends of the Bloomberg Library to, you know, pay the utilities?

327
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,541
It's a great question.

328
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,261
I think it's a great question.

329
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:18,882
No, we brought that up in the call.

330
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:21,783
We seem to be held to a different standard than every other

331
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:39,015
Manfred property that we can think of, you know, but I think again, the legal language here about, you know, it was the language of the agreement that the city helped write specifically said, this is not a tenant landlord situation.

332
00:29:39,215 --> 00:29:47,997
And it was written by the city, you know, and the fact that the inbound agreement from 97 says inbound should act as a landlord.

333
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:56,545
we're not acting as a landlord independent of the city, we are the city, where they're acting on their behalf.

334
00:29:57,105 --> 00:30:07,667
I think that's, again, why I think there's a bunch of lawyers here trying to split hairs to get them out of a political problem, but they're creating a bigger one.

335
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:19,270
Ultimately, we're going to have to amend the legislation, which will not be easy because the conservation restriction will be unchanged, but the manager's agreement with the city,

336
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:35,525
It's something we have to get Zach and the subcommittee working on as soon as we can to start fixing this problem to clarify exactly who does what so that this vagueness cannot be used against us, which is what's presently happening, obviously.

337
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:38,407
Right.

338
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:43,950
Having something firm to continue our next conversation with a little bit more

339
00:30:46,317 --> 00:30:55,545
Room for clarity, obviously, is what's needed so that we don't get caught off guard with the things that they think are our responsibility.

340
00:30:56,386 --> 00:31:05,314
As a matter of contract law, I don't think the city can get away with saying, well, this agreement doesn't mean anything because we didn't sign it, but they drafted it.

341
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:09,698
That's a very important distinction.

342
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,199
Thank you for saying that.

343
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:12,080
That's a good way to say that.

344
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:20,479
Yeah, it's very different than, you know, an insurance contract that isn't signed by the, you know, the policyholder.

345
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:28,185
You know, it's, we may have signed it, but they draft, we sign their document.

346
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:30,647
Correct.

347
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,008
And the next one we'll have.

348
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:35,408
a line on it for the City of Medford to sign as an example.

349
00:31:35,648 --> 00:31:38,128
Oh, lesson learned on that one.

350
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:45,550
And then for nothing, like, this brings up a whole, like, if they really try to do this, what about CPC projects?

351
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,591
What about, like, Tom has always worked with procurement on things.

352
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:56,252
It's like, okay, so if we're not part of the city, then we don't have to follow any of those other rules?

353
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,492
That doesn't even make sense.

354
00:31:58,012 --> 00:31:58,572
Of course not.

355
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:01,533
Jen, when I had to go to, we had an issue

356
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:05,901
when we designed and built the accessible lift in the manor, right?

357
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:10,404
We had to get a variance because it was technically not an elevator, right?

358
00:32:10,424 --> 00:32:16,909
So I had to go before the State Board of Appeals at the elevator guy, essentially.

359
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,891
Guess who was sitting right next to me?

360
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:24,735
Mark Romilly was sitting right next to me because they were the owners of the property, right?

361
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:26,677
You know, the precedence here

362
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:31,555
is overwhelming for responsibility and ownership.

363
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:34,338
Ownership is everything when it comes to any of these issues.

364
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:40,082
We can't write a grant without the city signing off on it because you don't own the property.

365
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:44,666
So again, legally, it falls apart.

366
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:45,487
It's a house of cards.

367
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:50,271
It falls apart as soon as you start digging an inch beneath the surface.

368
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:52,733
And again, for the last 20 plus years,

369
00:32:53,484 --> 00:33:01,330
But the whole thing of this year was to start to reengage the city and say, the way we've been doing things the last 25 years has not been great.

370
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,411
We need to improve it.

371
00:33:03,472 --> 00:33:06,034
We're going in full reverse right now.

372
00:33:06,174 --> 00:33:07,835
We're not moving forward.

373
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:10,217
They've got it full reverse going 100 miles an hour.

374
00:33:11,418 --> 00:33:15,181
That's not what we're looking for and not sustainable.

375
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,124
All right.

376
00:33:18,244 --> 00:33:20,385
So what are our next steps?

377
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,067
Reading the manager's agreement.

378
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:26,655
Yes, I just sent that to all the board members.

379
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:28,776
And I have included Zach on that.

380
00:33:29,317 --> 00:33:31,298
Unfortunately, Zach and I haven't been able to connect.

381
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,279
We've been trying since yesterday and today.

382
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,241
And I'm not sure how much of this he knows.

383
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:39,863
And I'm bummed he's not here tonight for this conversation.

384
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:43,305
I would like to talk with him soon to get his perspective.

385
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:48,288
But we do know that we need to have a conversation with the city.

386
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:57,806
we need to clarify our stance and what we know we can achieve and what we know we have to offer.

387
00:33:58,606 --> 00:34:04,508
I think it would also be great if we could go into that next conversation with examples of precedents.

388
00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:07,109
Doug, you mentioned some great ones already.

389
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:12,611
I would like to have those down on paper so that we can take those and make them uncontestable.

390
00:34:12,631 --> 00:34:16,472
Yeah, I think we almost need some sort of like

391
00:34:17,686 --> 00:34:20,327
not a legal response, but a legal response.

392
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:21,888
Like, we heard you.

393
00:34:22,468 --> 00:34:25,009
We have done some research on our end.

394
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:37,374
And our position is X, Y, and Z, you know, backed up by these legal arguments that I think Mark and maybe Ed and whoever else can help us.

395
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:38,935
Yeah.

396
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:39,475
That's great.

397
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:40,556
I think that's right.

398
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:51,435
Yeah, dropping some seeds in there of like we have some resources that we can tap, that we are not going into this just making stuff up.

399
00:34:53,364 --> 00:34:59,565
So Mark, do you think you can help us kind of shore up some of those details and figure out how we can have that conversation?

400
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:01,466
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:35:01,606 --> 00:35:03,626
I just want to review that agreement first.

402
00:35:03,987 --> 00:35:04,627
Absolutely.

403
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:06,907
And I don't know the timing of all of this.

404
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:09,968
I absolutely will keep you updated as things progress.

405
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:16,209
But you're right that there's a there's a separation between what we're doing with Stephen and what we're doing with the city.

406
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:17,410
Those are two separate issues.

407
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:22,765
with different priorities and different approaches.

408
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:25,226
So it's all happening.

409
00:35:27,306 --> 00:35:28,387
Just one final comment.

410
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:47,314
Remember from six, seven years ago, we had the last caretakers that might be before some people's time on this board, but we had some, you know, we had, we got into a situation there that was difficult because the woman, the couple there who were in there, the woman was in her early forties, she became pregnant.

411
00:35:48,926 --> 00:36:03,015
And we didn't have anything in our agreement about no children in the manor because we had always basically looked for people who we felt were probably not of childbearing age when we were looking for caretakers.

412
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:04,276
So they had to buy them out.

413
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:09,540
The city of Medford got deeply involved and we had to buy them out $25,000 to leave the manor.

414
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,822
That led directly to the caretaker agreement that Rumley

415
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:16,130
put together with Tom's assistance.

416
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,231
Tom had a pretty good legal mind too on some of these things for the current agreement.

417
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:38,115
I'll start pulling together the precedent list that I can think of over the last couple decades of direct City of Medford interaction with us on these type of issues to help bolster our case that this is just not the right way forward.

418
00:36:40,095 --> 00:36:40,416
Thank you.

419
00:36:40,436 --> 00:36:46,709
And I think one thing that needs to land on that precedence list is our most recent, which is the notice to quit, which was drafted by K.P.

420
00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:48,613
Law and signed by the mayor and delivered to Stephen.

421
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:49,716
Absolutely.

422
00:36:52,482 --> 00:37:10,566
Wonderful, so Mark and Doug, I would love you guys to work together on drafting that, and if anyone has anything to contribute, we would love to hear it, but I want to go into that next conversation, and I'd like to lead that next conversation with the mayor, but Doug, you've been extremely valuable in all this, so I'd like you to be there as well.

423
00:37:11,886 --> 00:37:17,907
Yeah, I'm assuming we need about a week's worth of time to kind of pull this all together and really come up with a game plan.

424
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:19,276
Absolutely.

425
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:20,016
That sounds great.

426
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:28,859
And I hope to connect with Zach in the meantime and figure out what his perspective is and if he has any recommendations on how we should move forward, because I'd like to include him as well.

427
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,441
Alba, we keep talking about Zach.

428
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:33,341
Zach is Zach Bares.

429
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:34,821
He's the president of city council.

430
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:40,743
So that's why he's also helpful to us from the city's perspective of having him sit on our board.

431
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:45,345
I have not met him, but I know who he is.

432
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:46,365
OK.

433
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:46,946
Sounds good.

434
00:37:46,966 --> 00:37:47,846
You'll meet him, I'm sure.

435
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:50,076
All right.

436
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:57,964
Well, that was something I've been really dreading talking to you all about, because it's just such a crappy place for us to be.

437
00:37:58,004 --> 00:38:00,947
But thank you for your honest response and your

438
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:02,685
We'll be fine.

439
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:04,226
We'll be fine.

440
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:05,326
We just got to work through it.

441
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,906
The mayor is not unreasonable.

442
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:10,107
I think she's just, again, I think it's a knee-jerk reaction.

443
00:38:10,147 --> 00:38:14,248
There's so much bad juju out there right now.

444
00:38:14,268 --> 00:38:19,289
We just got to get through the election and let things calm down a little bit.

445
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:21,390
And we'll figure it out.

446
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,690
We're a bunch of smart people.

447
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,691
And we all want good things.

448
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,551
And she does too.

449
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:29,252
We'll get there.

450
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:30,192
I agree.

451
00:38:31,912 --> 00:38:33,053
Yeah, that's a good way to say that.

452
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:44,359
And I just appreciate this group so much for, you know, you're right, we are all smart people and you all are caring people who really give a lot to this and give a lot of time and attention.

453
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:51,383
So thank you for being part of this problem solving and making sure that this doesn't just disappear into the other.

454
00:38:51,403 --> 00:38:56,866
Okay, are we ready to talk about something great?

455
00:38:57,906 --> 00:38:59,207
Yeah, what's next on the agenda?

456
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:01,234
Finances!

457
00:39:01,954 --> 00:39:02,635
Yay!

458
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:05,697
Well, it's actually not too bad.

459
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:11,380
So Mike Oliver, of course, our treasurer, has updated our financial snapshot.

460
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:16,163
Right now we've got, between our checking and savings, about $82,000 in the bank.

461
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:29,412
The anticipated CPC reimbursement, I still need to check in with him on because that's the interior and the electrical grants from last year, which I don't think we're actually seeking a reimbursement on still, but I need to just clarify that.

462
00:39:31,373 --> 00:39:37,334
We do expect to be reimbursed for the 1099 position that is covering Alba's time with us as well in the amount of $5,000.

463
00:39:37,714 --> 00:39:44,796
So Alba is being paid for a five-month contract between now and the end of February at the rate of $1,000 a month.

464
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:51,718
And that is going to be reimbursed, paid out of our bank account and then reimbursed by the city with the 1099 grant funding.

465
00:39:55,339 --> 00:40:00,775
We also expect to pay our annual dues for Massachusetts Land Trust Coalition in the amount of $100.

466
00:40:02,794 --> 00:40:04,456
and the P.O.

467
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:09,760
box six-month payment, which I just paid and will be reimbursed for at about $450.

468
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,164
So that $5,000 will even itself out, and then $250 is coming out of this $82,000.

469
00:40:15,484 --> 00:40:25,012
And those are the known expenses, and this does not include, of course, the utilities that I'm trying to figure out how to include and record that.

470
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:30,916
I was just going to say, should we, like, kind of make a line item for just, you know,

471
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:36,934
anticipated expenses over the next six months?

472
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:38,096
Well, yes.

473
00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:46,925
And actually, I'm sitting down with Mike Oliver on Sunday morning, and we are taking a look at our past expenses and estimated future expenses so we can start to form that budget.

474
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:50,188
And I will be able to bring that to you soon and kind of be your long snapshot.

475
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:54,392
Should we also add a chunk in there for possible legal fees?

476
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:58,658
Let's cross that bridge when we come to it, but yes.

477
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:03,004
It's probably not a bad idea because we might need to get somebody just from the caretaker perspective.

478
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:16,468
And I don't, unless we can find an attorney that will help us pro bono.

479
00:41:16,488 --> 00:41:22,949
Well, I just think we should expect the plan for the worst, but expect hope for the best or whatever.

480
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:23,049
Yeah.

481
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:25,089
You know what I mean?

482
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:29,730
Be ready for it, just in case.

483
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:41,652
If memory serves from what Cheryl told us that when you add up the oil, all the utilities, it's at least a thousand bucks a month for utilities in that building over the course of a year.

484
00:41:43,075 --> 00:41:46,499
So it depends on the oils are the biggest expense line.

485
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:56,873
The delivery of oil is obviously more frequent in the winter, which yes means we're about $500 every three weeks for oil deliveries.

486
00:41:57,674 --> 00:41:59,756
Historically, from what I saw, and then

487
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:05,789
But the oil is also down from last year a little bit.

488
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:09,932
So, you know, it varies based on the price of oil and gas.

489
00:42:10,893 --> 00:42:20,541
So, but yeah, I mean, I would probably put 1500 aside a month and, because we also don't know what he's gonna put the thermostat at.

490
00:42:22,662 --> 00:42:26,886
And if it gets cold, he could turn it up more and burn it quicker.

491
00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:33,424
Remember to at least 3 radios are not functioning, so they've been using electrical heaters.

492
00:42:33,544 --> 00:42:37,765
That's so that they're just transferring it to electricity as.

493
00:42:38,346 --> 00:42:40,446
You know, at the moment, which we're obviously working on the.

494
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:43,967
Yeah, okay.

495
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:47,648
All right, so I'll just distribute a copy of this after as well.

496
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:48,208
So if you want to.

497
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:55,033
Take a look, you sure can, but going back to our agenda to talk about the manor caretaker.

498
00:42:55,093 --> 00:43:01,460
Obviously, we've been talking a little bit about this, but the latest with Stephen's situation is that he is still in the manor.

499
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:05,644
We do not have a hard out timeline for him yet.

500
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:14,330
I have been contacted by his caseworker with Mystic Valley Elder Services, who is working with him to figure out what his next step is.

501
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:30,620
And the caseworker, who seems like he's a really great guy who is doing what he can with what he has, has asked for us to avoid housing court if we can come to an agreement for a timeline that Stephen can be

502
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,461
out of the manor at a specific date.

503
00:43:34,922 --> 00:43:42,466
I told him we were open to hearing about that, and he came back with the ask of giving Stephen 10 to 12 months to vacate.

504
00:43:46,608 --> 00:44:03,621
This would, if we agreed to the 10 to 12 months, Stephen would waive his right to go to housing court and we would settle everything out of court and get him out by that date with the hope that public housing would be available to him at that point with his status on a priority list.

505
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:07,424
From what I hear from the city, he has already been

506
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,206
put on a list for public housing.

507
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,067
So that is in motion.

508
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,648
But of course, we know that public housing lists are very long.

509
00:44:14,668 --> 00:44:19,490
And we don't even know if 10 to 12 months is actually the right timeline.

510
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,271
So is he a veteran?

511
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:24,012
No.

512
00:44:24,693 --> 00:44:27,674
Okay, good question, Andre.

513
00:44:29,535 --> 00:44:37,359
So yeah, and I haven't gone back to the caseworker yet, because of course, I was waiting until after I talked with the city.

514
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:45,896
And now we are needing to go back to the caseworker and kind of give an update, but I would like to counter their offer of 10 to 12 months.

515
00:44:47,097 --> 00:44:58,126
I wonder, but the thing that Doug and I are stuck on, because Doug and I have talked separately about this, the thing that Doug and I are stuck on is the fact that Steven has family nearby.

516
00:44:58,727 --> 00:45:00,308
Why is he on public housing lists?

517
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:04,331
And we've asked Steven about his family as an option.

518
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,373
He said, it's a no-go and we don't,

519
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:18,890
We're trying to figure out how to navigate whether we contact the family, whether we verify that he's contacted his family, or whether we just take his word for it.

520
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:22,332
So that's a point of undecided.

521
00:45:24,992 --> 00:45:26,453
That's an open-ended point for us right now.

522
00:45:27,881 --> 00:45:38,004
But Carly, question, what happens if, for example, let's say we agree that he can stay there for nine more months, and then nine months come and nothing's available for him, does he just continue to stay?

523
00:45:38,024 --> 00:45:51,308
So that's part of what needs to be written into the agreement with the caseworker, is the caseworker indicated that he has some precedence for this of having a hard out, but I don't know the what if on that hard out, and I would need to see what that agreement says.

524
00:45:51,388 --> 00:45:54,649
So you're exactly right, there's that open-ended possibility.

525
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,690
Because then we're just dragging

526
00:45:57,675 --> 00:45:59,296
Exactly, just kicking the can down the road.

527
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:15,027
And part of what KP Law was discussing with us yesterday, which they offered some advice and they clarified that they are not our counsel, so that is not legal advice that they are offering to us, or however they said it.

528
00:46:16,248 --> 00:46:23,213
They essentially think that the notice to quit might be enough to get an eviction notice granted, or at least started.

529
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:36,375
So I'm going to talk that through with the caseworker and see if he's been aware of that in the past and see if the process of formal eviction can be kickstarted at the date that the notice to quit was delivered.

530
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:47,778
It is my understanding that a notice to quit is the start of that, but I have not really been involved in too much on that.

531
00:46:48,658 --> 00:46:53,019
My suggestion for a date would be the end of the fiscal year, so June 30th.

532
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:57,947
If we're going to counter.

533
00:47:00,269 --> 00:47:03,032
Another thought was, you know, at the end of the heating season.

534
00:47:04,553 --> 00:47:07,997
You know, March 31, April 30.

535
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,722
But, you know, obviously it's a delicate situation.

536
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:14,903
Okay.

537
00:47:15,884 --> 00:47:16,325
Good thoughts.

538
00:47:17,426 --> 00:47:18,227
Doug, what were you going to say?

539
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:28,511
Well, the longer he's in there, obviously, the longer there's no utility payment of any kind, which is more of a financial burden, right?

540
00:47:29,332 --> 00:47:32,473
The city has agreed to pay during fiscal year 25.

541
00:47:34,234 --> 00:47:36,935
Which starts July 1st.

542
00:47:38,616 --> 00:47:40,737
Are we in fiscal year 25 now?

543
00:47:41,598 --> 00:47:41,878
Oh, wait.

544
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:45,976
Yeah, we're already in the fiscal year.

545
00:47:46,336 --> 00:47:47,756
So why are they not paying utilities?

546
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:49,897
I would love to remind Paul Reggie of that then.

547
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:50,697
Great.

548
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,838
I thought the fiscal year started the calendar year.

549
00:47:55,158 --> 00:47:56,379
It's July 1st.

550
00:47:56,899 --> 00:47:57,239
Great.

551
00:47:57,319 --> 00:47:58,199
To June 30th.

552
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:00,340
I'll work with Zach to remind Paul of that.

553
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,481
Yeah, and this coming July 1st will be the start of fiscal year 26.

554
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:05,481
26.

555
00:48:06,142 --> 00:48:07,202
Great.

556
00:48:07,562 --> 00:48:08,602
So we're currently in fiscal year 25.

557
00:48:08,642 --> 00:48:08,782
Correct.

558
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:13,034
Wonderful.

559
00:48:13,054 --> 00:48:24,778
Carly, is there any kind of legal motion or anything from the council meeting we just had about this so we can, wouldn't that be the answer to Paul Riggie's email about the utilities?

560
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:40,545
So the, I'm going to stop sharing for a second so I don't, you know, speak out of turn here, but starred emails, Zach Bears, great.

561
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:53,615
Let's share my screen for full transparency from the mayor on September 26th.

562
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:57,258
We have paper before you for the 10-12-2 meeting.

563
00:48:57,298 --> 00:48:58,238
That was for the repairs of 55,000.

564
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:11,368
Paul Riggi will cover the 5,000 in yearly bills, and that was the estimate we provided them for utilities for fiscal year 25 in his budget as well as $1,000 per month until we get a new tenant.

565
00:49:15,058 --> 00:49:24,401
And then she mentioned the hope that new tenant can cover in rent, which I asked Zach about, and he said that's a hope of hers.

566
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:27,263
So we're counting that as irrelevant for the time being.

567
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:29,503
But the important piece is this.

568
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,966
And Paul has his seat on that.

569
00:49:36,846 --> 00:49:42,288
One possible end game is the city of Medford is going to have to buy out Stephen just like they did the last one.

570
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:54,012
To get him to go, cut him a check, get him a room to leave, and give him a date certain, because he could be there for years.

571
00:49:54,853 --> 00:50:00,196
This housing option, the odds of this coming through are very small.

572
00:50:01,806 --> 00:50:08,791
And Doug, I think in order for them to write a check, they would need to feel some sense of involvement and we would need to climb that hill to get them to feel that way.

573
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:11,012
So I don't think we're close to that either.

574
00:50:11,673 --> 00:50:16,756
The city would want us to cut a check because they see us as the landlord.

575
00:50:16,776 --> 00:50:18,617
That's exactly what would happen.

576
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:24,641
What if we cut a check and then fought for reimbursement later on?

577
00:50:24,661 --> 00:50:27,963
I'm not saying that we're going to agree to that right now.

578
00:50:28,344 --> 00:50:30,125
I'm just throwing it out there as a

579
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:32,188
We got a check.

580
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:33,549
I wouldn't expect to see it again.

581
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:34,890
We'd never see it.

582
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:35,870
Never money again.

583
00:50:38,172 --> 00:50:41,154
And we've got the precedents that the city bought out the last people.

584
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:42,175
So that's in our favor.

585
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:44,214
Right, right.

586
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:48,796
So I would like to go back to the caseworker and talk this through a little bit more.

587
00:50:48,816 --> 00:50:56,380
I think at the most, I would like to propose that Steven is out by June 30th of next year.

588
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,422
So that means that is fiscal year 25, utilities are covered by the city.

589
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:09,287
We get a new tenant, maybe there's a gap of a couple of months where we're turning it over and finding new caretakers, but that at least is minimized.

590
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:14,688
Is that June 30th date okay with everyone?

591
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:18,411
I mean, that's... I think it's okay with them.

592
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:18,831
Yeah.

593
00:51:19,571 --> 00:51:22,373
I mean, because we originally gave him October 1.

594
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,494
And September 1 on paper.

595
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:28,177
So that's another nine months.

596
00:51:28,857 --> 00:51:34,761
Should we move to extend the deadline to get him out by June 30th?

597
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:37,622
Doug, what were you...

598
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:56,808
From previous caretaker searches to do the repairs we need to get them completed, advertise for caretakers, interview caretakers and sign them is going to be at least a six month process.

599
00:51:56,848 --> 00:51:58,809
So June 30th is not unreasonable.

600
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:00,050
Yeah.

601
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:02,864
Yeah, it's going to take a while.

602
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:06,570
We haven't even started construction yet and we'll get to that obviously later in the agenda, but.

603
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,113
We have a long way to go to get that place.

604
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:10,035
Um.

605
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:13,280
Stop I can't take it would want to, but there.

606
00:52:14,275 --> 00:52:16,837
We would want somebody in there by September.

607
00:52:17,477 --> 00:52:21,359
We don't want to wait until January of the following year to get somebody in there.

608
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:32,586
So what if we backed up and said April 30th, knowing that we might have to also extend another 60 days after that as a last minute?

609
00:52:34,707 --> 00:52:49,157
Because if he can be out by the end of April, let's say, that gives us May, June, July, August, September, that gives us five months in the height of rental season.

610
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,901
when people are looking for housing and when the best people are looking for housing.

611
00:52:55,181 --> 00:53:01,463
And I know it's different, you know, we're not, they're not tenants, we're not landlords, that's a whole nother thing we have to figure out.

612
00:53:01,523 --> 00:53:07,124
But the time that people turn over their housing is late spring and summer.

613
00:53:07,924 --> 00:53:16,207
And I think it's gonna be really important for us to try to match up our folks that we're looking for during that time period.

614
00:53:18,879 --> 00:53:25,603
Because after September one, people are in leases, people are committed to housing.

615
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:32,807
And frankly, the quality of tenants goes down significantly.

616
00:53:32,827 --> 00:53:34,408
Great point.

617
00:53:35,249 --> 00:53:35,529
Yeah.

618
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:42,613
Okay, so then are we moving our date up April 30?

619
00:53:44,214 --> 00:53:44,695
Instead of June 30?

620
00:53:47,192 --> 00:53:48,832
I mean, that's still, you know.

621
00:53:48,852 --> 00:53:50,193
It's still six months from right now.

622
00:53:50,553 --> 00:53:51,213
From right now.

623
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:53,094
That's a long time.

624
00:53:54,194 --> 00:53:56,214
Maybe it's not long enough, but I think we should try.

625
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:57,555
Right.

626
00:53:57,635 --> 00:54:05,817
And the counter or the pushback that I'm going to get from the caseworker is that it's not going to be long enough for public housing, but neither is 10 or 12 months in my mind.

627
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,418
So I don't know what difference it makes.

628
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:08,678
Right.

629
00:54:08,698 --> 00:54:11,459
If it's an emergency case, it's an emergency case no matter what.

630
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:15,940
And at least we're saying we're committing to housing him through the winter.

631
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,080
Yes.

632
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,742
Yeah, sorry.

633
00:54:18,942 --> 00:54:20,503
And we're paying the heat.

634
00:54:21,364 --> 00:54:21,624
Yeah.

635
00:54:22,024 --> 00:54:23,385
And he's, he's there for free.

636
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:27,548
Okay, April 30.

637
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:31,611
Okay, I'll connect with the caseworker.

638
00:54:31,631 --> 00:54:36,955
I don't think I'm going to make any firm decisions with the caseworker.

639
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,597
But I will explore that.

640
00:54:39,717 --> 00:54:42,980
And any firm decisions that need to be made, I'll bring them to the board before they're made.

641
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:52,595
I would also reiterate Carly that he has known about this since Cheryl decided to leave, right?

642
00:54:52,615 --> 00:54:55,536
So, or probably longer, let's be honest.

643
00:54:55,576 --> 00:55:04,598
Like they were probably, you know, like, and then he's already, he already had 60 days with the first deadline.

644
00:55:04,758 --> 00:55:10,119
So by the time it's all said and done, it will, it will have been 10 to 12 months.

645
00:55:12,023 --> 00:55:15,625
from kind of the first decision that sparked this whole thing.

646
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:19,647
That could be a good way to phrase that for sure if we're getting pushback.

647
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:20,488
Right.

648
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:29,653
Okay, I'll explore that and I'll come back with any updates on that so that we can make a decision accordingly as a group.

649
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:30,714
Great.

650
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,214
Okay, thanks.

651
00:55:33,175 --> 00:55:34,796
Thank you all for your thoughts on that.

652
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:37,778
I'm glad it's not just me sitting in it.

653
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:41,715
Trying to figure out the right thing to do, because it's such a hard answer.

654
00:55:41,735 --> 00:55:45,720
Okay, next item on the agenda.

655
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:47,282
Admin physician.

656
00:55:47,502 --> 00:55:49,024
Oh, we do actually get to celebrate this one.

657
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:52,868
This is my favorite item on the agenda, because we are joined by our new admin today.

658
00:55:52,928 --> 00:55:53,689
This is Alba.

659
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,512
Alba has joined us as of...

660
00:55:57,676 --> 00:56:00,097
about a week ago, I guess we made it official.

661
00:56:00,117 --> 00:56:06,358
So she will be with us until the end of February, working on some distinct projects as our admin.

662
00:56:07,399 --> 00:56:11,600
And those distinct projects are three core areas of work.

663
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,341
The first is organization of our online files.

664
00:56:15,401 --> 00:56:20,502
Of course, this transition from Tom to myself means a transition of information and systems.

665
00:56:20,582 --> 00:56:23,263
And Alba is helping us make sure that all of the information

666
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:28,306
is where it needs to be, and it's easy for us to find and access as a group.

667
00:56:28,626 --> 00:56:30,827
So that'll be a big project for us.

668
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:36,651
Another big project for us is making sure we have an accurate representation of our membership.

669
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:39,913
So ALBA is establishing a membership list.

670
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:59,852
and making sure it's accurate, making sure it also is livable so that as we bring on new members, we can add them to our ongoing list and always know who our members are, when they need to pay their dues, where they live, how to contact them, how they prefer to be contacted, all of those important things we need to know about our members.

671
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:22,088
The third body of work is Alba will be working on a handbook for us as a nonprofit entity that is in charge of keeping ourselves organized and having our own processes and procedures, having them all written down in one place in case all of us get hit by a bus at the same time, the next person can come up and take over.

672
00:57:24,248 --> 00:57:28,370
some big projects that we're so grateful for you to help out with.

673
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:34,933
So Alba, do you want to just let us know a little bit about you and whatever you want us to know?

674
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:36,393
Sure.

675
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:39,075
As Carly said, I'm Alba.

676
00:57:39,795 --> 00:57:43,356
I've been living in Medford for 25 years.

677
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:50,520
I grew up in Europe, moved to the States actually as a refugee during the war in Kosovo in the late 90s.

678
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,101
So Medford holds

679
00:57:54,693 --> 00:57:59,696
a warm place in my heart because I've been here most of the time in this country.

680
00:57:59,716 --> 00:58:02,958
I am a mom of three boys.

681
00:58:03,799 --> 00:58:08,102
I took some time off to stay home with them for a little bit and now back to work.

682
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:14,025
Along with this position, I actually started a part-time position at Harvard as well.

683
00:58:14,105 --> 00:58:16,187
That's awesome.

684
00:58:16,547 --> 00:58:17,227
Thank you.

685
00:58:17,387 --> 00:58:19,609
It's good to be back.

686
00:58:21,018 --> 00:58:22,879
you know, to work and do things.

687
00:58:22,919 --> 00:58:34,545
I've worked in the financial industry, I've worked in the nutrition side, I've been in a lot of different management roles, and I've done some consulting as well with the car industry.

688
00:58:34,585 --> 00:58:35,226
So it's been good.

689
00:58:35,786 --> 00:58:37,787
And I'm really, really happy to work with all of you guys.

690
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:46,762
Jen and I are so excited about Alba being a doer, and everything we've seen so far has just been really promising.

691
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:49,883
And we're thinking Alba's going to work about 10 hours a week on these projects.

692
00:58:49,903 --> 00:58:56,964
We're hoping it's not too much of a lift, but over the course of five months, we'll continue to have some great conversations and figure out what direction we want to go.

693
00:58:57,145 --> 00:59:00,485
So you'll see Alba at future board meetings, of course, as well.

694
00:59:01,046 --> 00:59:02,186
And I'm just glad you're here.

695
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:03,786
Thank you so much.

696
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:04,907
Yes, so glad.

697
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:06,767
Happy to be here.

698
00:59:06,787 --> 00:59:09,228
All right.

699
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:15,222
Anything before I move to our next topic, anything on this admin piece?

700
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:19,123
Nope.

701
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:21,003
Just bring us some chocolate from Europe, OK?

702
00:59:21,664 --> 00:59:24,425
Oh, she knows the good stuff too, I mean.

703
00:59:26,776 --> 00:59:31,722
I do what I can.

704
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:35,747
We have some big upcoming projects that we're hoping to tackle.

705
00:59:35,767 --> 00:59:43,136
One that we just got a little bit of resolution on was our winter prep manor work.

706
00:59:43,296 --> 00:59:44,317
Doug found some

707
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:50,319
quotes or some estimates for us on some roof repairs, radiator repairs, painting and plastering.

708
00:59:50,339 --> 00:59:51,579
So the tune of $55,000.

709
00:59:51,939 --> 00:59:56,680
So that was put in front of city council last week, maybe two weeks ago.

710
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,721
Time is blurring together right now.

711
00:59:59,521 --> 01:00:03,842
And it was grouped together with other asks from other parts of the city.

712
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:08,443
And the entire resolution was passed through city council.

713
01:00:08,523 --> 01:00:09,563
So I need to connect with

714
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:14,711
Zach, to see what next steps are for us using and spending that money.

715
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:19,135
But Doug, do you have any updates on your side on the Winter Prep Manor work side?

716
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:26,001
Yeah, I had direct conversations with the contractor for the slate and copper.

717
01:00:26,922 --> 01:00:35,830
Before I left from here, they were supposed to swing by the manor and take the drawings I put together, which showed the last board meeting.

718
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:37,432
and present a quote.

719
01:00:37,472 --> 01:00:40,573
I have not heard from them, so I'll follow up with them as soon as I get back.

720
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:45,795
I did talk directly to the gentleman who's done the boiler work in the manor.

721
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:52,558
He would be the one that would connect the radiators to kind of get us more functioning on the heating system and the caretaker areas.

722
01:00:53,338 --> 01:00:56,399
He also, well, in the last week and a half, was supposed to connect.

723
01:00:57,679 --> 01:00:58,640
He knows the building well.

724
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,160
He's supposed to go there.

725
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,901
I don't think he has yet, but I'll call him.

726
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:05,022
It sounds like he's a very mom-and-pop organization.

727
01:01:07,259 --> 01:01:11,423
But we'll get them over there, and that work can proceed as quickly as possible.

728
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:22,095
Now that we have approval, we can just start, you know, as stuff becomes available, we'll just start doing it, the roof being the top priority, the radiator is the second most.

729
01:01:24,977 --> 01:01:25,217
Great.

730
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:34,524
So something I'll clarify with the City then, Doug, is whether we are sending them the invoices from these contractors or whether we're paying them and expecting reimbursement.

731
01:01:34,544 --> 01:01:37,105
Do you have any indication from your knowledge on that?

732
01:01:38,466 --> 01:01:46,252
No, but I think if the City Council just approved, you know, we have an estimate that was part of that package that you presented to the City Council, right?

733
01:01:46,272 --> 01:01:46,612
So we can

734
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:59,860
In my opinion, they've basically given us the money and we just need to get the quotes, submit them, and that money, because I don't think we have $55,000 in the bank, right?

735
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,881
Exactly.

736
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:03,943
We can't deplete everything.

737
01:02:03,963 --> 01:02:10,948
I'm not sure the exact machinations of the reimbursement and how that happens.

738
01:02:11,048 --> 01:02:13,971
I think it would be exactly somebody in procurement.

739
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:14,751
Yeah, exactly.

740
01:02:14,771 --> 01:02:15,432
We can sort that out.

741
01:02:15,452 --> 01:02:15,592
Sure.

742
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:18,002
Great.

743
01:02:18,283 --> 01:02:23,188
Well, I'm grateful that that's getting done, especially as the colder months are upon us.

744
01:02:23,628 --> 01:02:29,334
So Doug, do you feel confident about a timeline for that happening before we get hit by snow or anything?

745
01:02:30,676 --> 01:02:35,561
I'm not sure about that one because they have not been very responsive so far.

746
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:39,966
I think the boy guy would definitely be in the next few weeks, the slate and copper one.

747
01:02:41,588 --> 01:02:51,392
I don't know exactly how that's going to work out, but hopefully the snow will hold off at least until the end of the year, the heavy stuff, and we can get that done in hopefully the month of November.

748
01:02:51,412 --> 01:02:59,015
Okay, and then the paint and plastering I know is another piece of that, and we're planning to do that while Stephen's still in there.

749
01:02:59,075 --> 01:02:59,795
Is that a fair assumption?

750
01:03:00,755 --> 01:03:01,976
Oh, absolutely.

751
01:03:02,056 --> 01:03:03,697
And I don't think that's going to be a problem.

752
01:03:03,757 --> 01:03:09,821
I think Stephen is mostly in the one big room above the kitchen at the end of the manor.

753
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:13,303
A lot of the work is in the two or three other rooms.

754
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:15,244
So we can coordinate that.

755
01:03:15,304 --> 01:03:18,146
I'm not expecting that to be an issue of construction coordination.

756
01:03:19,247 --> 01:03:19,467
Great.

757
01:03:20,808 --> 01:03:21,188
Super.

758
01:03:21,348 --> 01:03:25,131
So that's the manor work that's coming up, and that's our most immediate project.

759
01:03:27,861 --> 01:03:36,985
The other piece that I'm not going to have quite the extended conversation that I originally planned on having, because I wanted to have the space for the city conversation.

760
01:03:37,645 --> 01:03:40,747
So this is the start of a conversation that I plan to continue.

761
01:03:40,827 --> 01:03:47,990
But we do have $250,000 as earmarked funds from the state, so the Commonwealth, through ARPA.

762
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:53,132
And that is true funds that we do need to spend by June 30th of 2025.

763
01:03:56,237 --> 01:03:59,259
So services rendered need to fall before that time.

764
01:04:00,339 --> 01:04:05,762
The $250,000 is reimbursement money that we can seek.

765
01:04:06,022 --> 01:04:17,528
However, I have spoken with somebody through the Office of Economic Development with the state, and they have talked about ways that we can do reimbursement in sections.

766
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:22,698
As we spend money, we can reimburse money immediately, seek reimbursement immediately.

767
01:04:22,718 --> 01:04:26,021
And it sounds like it's a matter of just a few business days turnaround time.

768
01:04:26,502 --> 01:04:28,003
So at least we won't be waiting too long.

769
01:04:28,663 --> 01:04:34,789
And it also sounds like we have the option of reimbursing against invoices instead of money spent, which is a great option for us as well.

770
01:04:36,258 --> 01:04:45,021
So that $250,000 earmark was written in with some specifications around being used specifically on the access drive work.

771
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:52,303
However, the designs that we have seen on the access drive so far, the price tag expected on that is, of course, more than $250,000.

772
01:04:54,884 --> 01:05:02,989
Part of what we need to do is understand what we can accomplish before June of next year to spend those ARPA funds in a meaningful way.

773
01:05:04,049 --> 01:05:06,991
And that's what I wanted to bring to you today.

774
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:09,112
I've drafted some thoughts around

775
01:05:10,802 --> 01:05:17,028
What we can do, how we can do this, something I'd like to propose and kind of get your feedback on it.

776
01:05:17,088 --> 01:05:18,750
So I'm going to show you now.

777
01:05:19,111 --> 01:05:22,234
I'm going to send this to you to digest and process.

778
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:30,682
And then I'd like for us to talk about at our next board meeting, really, the details of how this could or would not work.

779
01:05:30,822 --> 01:05:30,943
So.

780
01:05:31,483 --> 01:05:40,149
I'm going to pull up a sheet that I will send with you later, but essentially we know that we need to spend the designated ARPA funds by June 30th of 2025.

781
01:05:40,289 --> 01:05:50,057
So it's important that we identify some focus areas of our Access Drive project as a whole, and then we figure out the budget needs of those focus areas.

782
01:05:51,187 --> 01:05:52,588
And that's what I'll show you in just a moment.

783
01:05:52,628 --> 01:05:58,790
But I want us to also identify, while we're identifying those focus areas, I want us to figure out funding sources.

784
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:13,575
We know we have the ARPA sources or the ARPA funds as one source, but I also want to factor in some thinking around how we can engage our members, how we can seek out community partners in specific actions, and how we can seek grants in specific areas as well.

785
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,812
So those are the short-term focus areas that I have.

786
01:06:16,972 --> 01:06:26,481
I also know that long-term, this all needs to help us build momentum for the future project phases, because we don't want to start and then stop and then have nowhere to go.

787
01:06:26,501 --> 01:06:35,450
And all along the way, I need to make sure that we maintain the trust of our members first and foremost, the neighbors of the Brooks Estate, and of course, the city.

788
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:43,982
So those are the objectives that I'm approaching this with, and I've sketched out a couple of some projects.

789
01:06:45,424 --> 01:06:51,353
Parking lot preparation is one piece that I think is going to be core of this, and that will be the $250,000 allotment.

790
01:06:53,796 --> 01:06:58,938
that I hope will go towards some tree clearing, some grading, and some stone pack.

791
01:06:58,978 --> 01:07:03,520
And this will be in the future parking lot area that's up near the carriage house.

792
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:08,382
We're essentially preparing the land to have the full parking lot installation.

793
01:07:08,902 --> 01:07:13,564
But at least we're starting with a proof of concept, so to speak, of here's where a parking lot will be.

794
01:07:14,244 --> 01:07:15,345
Let's use it a little bit.

795
01:07:15,785 --> 01:07:18,806
Let's make sure that it's actually becoming real.

796
01:07:18,946 --> 01:07:21,267
And I'm not sure if bearing utilities will need to be a part of that.

797
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:40,864
So the $250,000 budget that I've estimated here, Doug, I've actually gone in and pulled out the document from Banesh and kind of taken a look at whether it's possible that we can do some of this, but I'm a little cloudy right now about that particular area because it's all kind of lumped into the same quote.

798
01:07:41,884 --> 01:07:49,766
So Doug, you specifically, I would love your help in understanding if this $250,000 number is anywhere near reality for that particular set of work.

799
01:07:51,961 --> 01:07:59,108
Yeah, this is a tough one because we're doing kind of a proof of concept.

800
01:08:00,089 --> 01:08:00,710
I don't think

801
01:08:01,701 --> 01:08:08,945
you know, we can do like lighting and major utility work, because that money would like that money would evaporate very quickly.

802
01:08:09,025 --> 01:08:10,066
Right, exactly.

803
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:16,309
And the question I have for you, Carly, because this is a great start, by the way, this is really helpful for me to kind of get my arms around this.

804
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:21,332
Because we have the final drawings, which we haven't seen for the whole design.

805
01:08:21,893 --> 01:08:31,138
But I wondered if the upper money would pay for a few $1,000 for the next time to create something that is kind of a standalone, like,

806
01:08:32,515 --> 01:08:37,381
But one document we can give to someone who's going to be clearing the trees and grading.

807
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:40,084
Because we don't have, we're out of funds with them.

808
01:08:40,104 --> 01:08:43,708
We don't like, we literally have no money left and that project is closed.

809
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:53,459
But I don't think what we have can be used right now in a package to support this limited but important concept of

810
01:08:54,435 --> 01:09:08,787
Grading and clearing of the trees, which is an issue, but creating a partial parking lot up there that is functional, but is not anywhere near the full final project.

811
01:09:12,889 --> 01:09:24,020
Do you think we can get maybe $5,000 to throw Ganesh's way to create a scope of work that I can work with him on that we could then price out and get that done in the spring?

812
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:34,630
I want to look at that ARPA document, the agreement that we signed, because we might be able to take that $5,000 out of there and we might be able to say this is part of the overall

813
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:38,368
package of making this work happen.

814
01:09:38,468 --> 01:09:39,729
So let me take a look.

815
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:45,431
And I think that's so what I'm hearing from you is that we kind of need to go back to Banesh and say give us a new package.

816
01:09:48,236 --> 01:09:49,857
It's really going to be one or two drawings.

817
01:09:50,397 --> 01:09:59,402
It's just taking what they've done and narrowly focusing it on the parking lot, existing grading, new grading, tree removal.

818
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:01,103
It's just a couple of drawings.

819
01:10:01,123 --> 01:10:02,123
There's almost nothing there.

820
01:10:02,263 --> 01:10:05,345
The parking lot we create is not for night events.

821
01:10:05,405 --> 01:10:09,247
It would just be for during the daytime so we can avoid those costs.

822
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:14,909
If we can get the accessible walking path carved out, I think that would be great too.

823
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:15,830
I think it's a great idea.

824
01:10:16,673 --> 01:10:19,375
So I think this is an excellent start to getting that ball rolling.

825
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:21,677
Okay.

826
01:10:22,177 --> 01:10:23,158
Let's start there.

827
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:24,279
I'll check out the document.

828
01:10:24,739 --> 01:10:26,721
We do have some CPA funding as well.

829
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:36,308
I found a memorandum of understanding from earlier this year that applies to access drive things.

830
01:10:36,688 --> 01:10:37,769
So I will share that.

831
01:10:38,089 --> 01:10:40,371
I'm going to kind of share this all together as a package.

832
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:45,014
But I think we could apply some CPA funds to this as well to boost the $250,000 from ARPA.

833
01:10:47,154 --> 01:10:47,954
That sounds right.

834
01:10:48,294 --> 01:10:49,435
Okay.

835
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,455
Specifically for the parking lot preparation.

836
01:10:52,996 --> 01:10:58,037
I also think it's very important that as we're tearing down trees and as we're grading the land.

837
01:10:59,038 --> 01:11:12,022
We need to be replanting trees, or we need to be showing people the overall plan so that we can restore and preserve their faith that yes, this is conservation land and we want to make sure that we're caring for it.

838
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:23,298
So part of what I'm proposing here as well is tree replanting almost in congruence with the parking lot preparation.

839
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:31,761
Obviously, the timing of that is going to be a little bit offset, but I think it would be great for us to have a project sign up there that describes our overall plan and what we'll be doing.

840
01:11:32,301 --> 01:11:36,523
So anyone walking by sees the jarring removal of trees and can see the larger project.

841
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:59,186
But I would like to then take the tree replanting phase and establish a capital campaign for us to take to our membership base and our banks in the area and any businesses that want to sponsor things and ask them to sponsor individual trees and make it something tangible that we can fundraise against.

842
01:12:00,507 --> 01:12:03,108
Probably that's also the group trees Medford.

843
01:12:03,168 --> 01:12:03,828
I don't know.

844
01:12:05,168 --> 01:12:16,051
They might want to join us partnership and they probably already have a membership, or at least a friends database or something that they might want to join in on that.

845
01:12:16,971 --> 01:12:21,292
Great idea and I know I reached out to me to grab coffee.

846
01:12:21,332 --> 01:12:28,434
She's the tree warden for the city of Medford and I haven't gotten coffee with her yet, but I really want to so that I can talk about this with her and see what her thoughts are.

847
01:12:30,368 --> 01:12:34,211
So we'll see.

848
01:12:34,251 --> 01:12:35,512
So tree replanting, go ahead.

849
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:37,294
Yeah, one final thought.

850
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,336
You're right about the CPC funds.

851
01:12:40,436 --> 01:12:45,961
The way we shoehorned this request in was built all around accessibility.

852
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:55,789
So we have to... The accessible path and parking spaces are what's driving it.

853
01:12:55,869 --> 01:12:57,470
That's the only way we got that money.

854
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:58,151
So we have to...

855
01:12:58,903 --> 01:13:14,629
We what even the budget is limited, we have to at least do that part of it to make sure that we have proof of concept for them on the accessible parking and drive walkway path to the manor and carriage house.

856
01:13:14,669 --> 01:13:15,930
So I'll make sure that's part of the deal.

857
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:22,993
That sounds great because that's the other piece of what I wanted to propose was in addition to the tree planting, which is its own capital campaign.

858
01:13:23,033 --> 01:13:25,054
I would like to see a capital campaign for.

859
01:13:26,776 --> 01:13:33,641
It's almost like a walk bike, join us sort of feel where we have the walking paths from the parking lot to the manor.

860
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:38,085
We have some walkways ADA walkway along the manor and the carriage house.

861
01:13:38,866 --> 01:13:40,347
Maybe this is where we install some.

862
01:13:40,927 --> 01:13:50,369
Lights some I saw some of the shorter lights, not some of the larger, but like the pathway walkway lights and maybe we can put a bike rack up there and a bench.

863
01:13:51,089 --> 01:13:56,650
Some of these things that make it seem like this is a welcoming community space to help people feel invited.

864
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:59,471
That could be something that we could apply these CPC funds to as well.

865
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:05,392
I love that I love that.

866
01:14:05,452 --> 01:14:06,572
I think we could do like.

867
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:16,843
You know, just like they did at the library, they sold pavers, you know, name the pavers, name the benches, name the trees.

868
01:14:19,785 --> 01:14:27,290
We should definitely reach out to the folks at the library who did their capital campaigns, because they did a really good job.

869
01:14:28,402 --> 01:14:41,690
Yeah, I plan to, because I think capital campaign is an angle that hits a lot of what I'm trying to do in this initial phase of my time here as well, is we're trying to invite visibility.

870
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:47,193
We're trying to give people, sorry, one second, tangible ways to support us.

871
01:14:50,756 --> 01:14:57,760
Tangible ways to support us so that we can make them feel like they're part of this, and this is a good way for us to raise money and activate people.

872
01:14:59,978 --> 01:15:00,178
Yeah.

873
01:15:04,186 --> 01:15:10,137
And I think it's an easy ask for like the business community, and some of our businesses in town.

874
01:15:13,765 --> 01:15:16,087
I don't know, it should be an easy ask, I feel like.

875
01:15:16,187 --> 01:15:16,627
I'm hoping.

876
01:15:16,747 --> 01:15:21,491
I mean, and this is exactly the research, the grant research that we're doing right now too.

877
01:15:21,571 --> 01:15:23,253
I'm sorry, guys, I just got joined by a toddler.

878
01:15:24,213 --> 01:15:27,856
This is the grant research that we have to see what even opportunities.

879
01:15:27,896 --> 01:15:38,625
So that's the direction that I'm going is, and I wanna figure out what distinct projects we can give ourselves that are bite-sized parts of this access drive, because we know we're gonna do the access drive.

880
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:40,967
So how do we make it happen in chunks?

881
01:15:45,858 --> 01:15:46,178
I love it.

882
01:15:46,218 --> 01:15:46,718
This is great.

883
01:15:48,379 --> 01:15:48,779
Wonderful.

884
01:15:49,019 --> 01:15:52,940
Give me one moment to talk about yourselves for just one.

885
01:15:57,421 --> 01:15:58,941
They always want to make an appearance.

886
01:15:59,362 --> 01:16:00,942
Right.

887
01:16:01,362 --> 01:16:03,203
Well, he's he's living his best life.

888
01:16:03,343 --> 01:16:07,704
I gave him pizza and he's getting to stay up past his bedtime.

889
01:16:07,824 --> 01:16:09,524
So we're all happy over here.

890
01:16:09,984 --> 01:16:11,065
That's always exciting.

891
01:16:12,325 --> 01:16:12,525
So

892
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:15,498
As I mentioned, I'll be sharing this document.

893
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:19,583
I do have a greater breakdown in Excel for anyone who's interested about.

894
01:16:19,624 --> 01:16:23,749
Jen, I think especially you, I was giving some thought to what would the benefits be?

895
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:27,494
Could we do little tree tags and how much would that cost and how much are we really fundraising?

896
01:16:28,808 --> 01:16:29,828
I'll share what I have.

897
01:16:29,848 --> 01:16:32,530
I would love for you all to digest it, take a look.

898
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:42,434
Let me know if there's any other things that we should be factoring into this, how we should be accomplishing this, because we got to spend that 250.

899
01:16:43,294 --> 01:16:46,876
But I don't want to, yeah, it's not going to work.

900
01:16:48,117 --> 01:16:49,477
I don't want to just let it go.

901
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:55,220
We might want to come up with a targeted list of businesses in town that we can go after.

902
01:16:57,664 --> 01:17:10,803
just to have a working list, and not just for this, but for anything in the future that we want to ask for money for, whether it's a picnic or whatever, you know.

903
01:17:13,627 --> 01:17:17,670
In fact, Carly, I was going to ask you because I'm going to send the newsletter out next week.

904
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:25,215
And I know on there we had my mock one had a grant researcher as the volunteer focus.

905
01:17:26,916 --> 01:17:33,581
So I was just thinking like, what do we want our volunteer focus to be our ask for the newsletter to try to get somebody to help?

906
01:17:35,002 --> 01:17:42,706
Yeah, no, that's kind of been on my mind too, is like the volunteer form we have right now, I need to update it because it has the fall cleanup on it.

907
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:44,207
It's got the grant research volunteer.

908
01:17:44,227 --> 01:17:46,749
We filled that, has a social media volunteer.

909
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:49,890
So it's time to talk about our next volunteer opportunities.

910
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:59,676
So I'm not sure I'm going to identify those at this moment, because I think I would like to hear that via email if anyone has ideas.

911
01:18:00,116 --> 01:18:01,277
But I agree that it's

912
01:18:02,555 --> 01:18:04,916
a good something for us to think about.

913
01:18:06,476 --> 01:18:08,217
I started I started a list.

914
01:18:08,277 --> 01:18:12,599
I think it's in the drive somewhere of kind of like the top 10.

915
01:18:13,179 --> 01:18:15,340
So my thought would probably be like,

916
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:20,454
somebody to be a liaison with the business community or somebody to be a liaison with the schools.

917
01:18:21,574 --> 01:18:26,196
So we can get some more volunteer bodies, but I don't remember what else they put on that list, but.

918
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:29,637
It was a partnerships one that I think was a really good idea.

919
01:18:29,977 --> 01:18:34,239
So I think if we start with the partnerships one for the newsletter, we already have identified that one.

920
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:35,659
It's already listed on our form.

921
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:40,541
So go ahead and stick that one in there for this month and then we'll come up with some more for next month.

922
01:18:40,561 --> 01:18:40,821
Perfect.

923
01:18:42,982 --> 01:18:43,342
Sounds good.

924
01:18:45,131 --> 01:18:58,216
All right, so on this, the idea of the access drive work and all of the funding sources, I want to just kind of open the space for any funding sources that we're not considering any project focus areas that we're not considering.

925
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:06,799
Immediately hit on most of it.

926
01:19:06,839 --> 01:19:07,079
Yeah.

927
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:14,911
Okay, and I know it's 830, so I do want us to wrap up so that we can all enjoy our mornings in Italy.

928
01:19:14,931 --> 01:19:18,775
And I just want to.

929
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:29,084
Again, reiterate that I would, I would love for you to think about this to think this through and to send me some thoughts and we'll discuss it more in depth at our next board meeting as well.

930
01:19:32,006 --> 01:19:32,246
Great.

931
01:19:33,215 --> 01:19:35,156
Wonderful so our next meeting is November 21st.

932
01:19:35,296 --> 01:19:39,417
it's already on the calendar, of course, with a zoom.

933
01:19:40,457 --> 01:19:47,779
Invite that hopefully will work without a hitch next time and that is the Thursday before Thanksgiving.

934
01:19:47,819 --> 01:19:49,600
So, luckily, we're avoiding the holiday by a week.

935
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,501
So we'll dedicate some time to talking about the access drive.

936
01:19:55,079 --> 01:20:06,754
Excuse me, during that November meeting, we'll add a new standing agenda item of the grants and I would maybe let's invite Nancy to see what kind of grants she's found and think about what we need to apply for.

937
01:20:08,282 --> 01:20:22,450
Um, some action items from this particular meeting, uh, Janet, you're going to help us draft a little something a letter basically saying, yes, we're donating the police call box to arts collaborative Medford with a stipulation that we'd like to see some Brooks estate history included.

938
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:29,855
Uh, Jen, once you have that, if you could distribute it to the board to see if we have any additions, make sure to finalize that and get that sent to them.

939
01:20:30,735 --> 01:20:32,737
Probably in the next week or so, is that reasonable?

940
01:20:33,157 --> 01:20:33,317
Yeah.

941
01:20:34,775 --> 01:20:35,175
great.

942
01:20:35,535 --> 01:20:48,799
And then I am going to have a conversation with Zach about what's going on with the city, but Mark, you and Doug are going to work together to see what kind of legal nuggets we can share in our next conversation, especially as it relates to precedence.

943
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,920
That will be extremely helpful.

944
01:20:54,401 --> 01:21:01,883
Manor caretaker, I am going to work with the caseworker to make sure that we propose an April 30th out date for Stephen.

945
01:21:02,995 --> 01:21:09,238
and see what kind of thoughts he has on that and bring whatever action back to you all.

946
01:21:11,178 --> 01:21:15,060
And Alba's going to keep doing great work on the admin, but yay, we've hired someone.

947
01:21:17,901 --> 01:21:26,165
Doug, you're going to move forward on the manor work once you get those quotes back from everyone, once you get back in the States.

948
01:21:27,317 --> 01:21:40,561
And then I will review some of the CPA documents, the ARPA documents, and we'll move forward with thinking about how to activate the mesh in identifying a smaller version of the parking lot installation projects.

949
01:21:42,782 --> 01:21:43,823
Did I miss anything?

950
01:21:44,383 --> 01:21:47,486
I just thought of a little something, kind of an aside.

951
01:21:47,807 --> 01:21:52,070
I am going to participate in Allentown Open Studios on November 9th.

952
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:54,112
Hi, Sam.

953
01:21:54,813 --> 01:22:07,764
Is there a general, like, flyer that either you or Jen have that just, like, just something, a little blurb about the Brooks Estate with the website address on it that I could have at my table?

954
01:22:08,545 --> 01:22:09,406
Good question.

955
01:22:09,826 --> 01:22:11,467
We can make something people.

956
01:22:11,547 --> 01:22:11,927
Yeah.

957
01:22:11,947 --> 01:22:14,168
That would be awesome.

958
01:22:14,949 --> 01:22:15,229
Okay.

959
01:22:15,509 --> 01:22:16,270
I love that idea.

960
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:16,670
Thank you.

961
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:17,430
I just thought of it.

962
01:22:19,151 --> 01:22:24,254
I will say, when I went to the farmer's market, I took the monopoly board with me and it was a hit.

963
01:22:25,395 --> 01:22:27,476
People want to stop by and like seeing it.

964
01:22:27,516 --> 01:22:30,838
So if you have one, if you want to borrow mine, I'd be happy to lend it.

965
01:22:32,265 --> 01:22:37,009
It might not have room for that, but I would have room for a pile of lyre.

966
01:22:37,069 --> 01:22:44,375
That might be good to have on our sale list, fundraiser list for part of the capital campaign.

967
01:22:44,415 --> 01:22:51,281
Like if they don't want to buy a tree or donate a paver, maybe they'll buy a Monopoly board.

968
01:22:51,301 --> 01:22:55,844
Sounds good.

969
01:22:56,765 --> 01:22:58,526
Related to what Audrey just said,

970
01:23:00,148 --> 01:23:08,996
I'm involved with the NAACP in Medford and they have a freedom of breakfast on the Sunday before the election.

971
01:23:09,236 --> 01:23:10,717
I think it's the 2nd of November.

972
01:23:11,638 --> 01:23:23,108
And I was going to donate $500 just out of my pocket, but I wanted to use that to put an ad in the program for M-Belt.

973
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,109
So I just need

974
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:34,692
kind of a graphic blurb that we could be a full page, you know, thing, saying, you know, join the Brooks Estate, come to the Brooks Estate.

975
01:23:35,233 --> 01:23:35,993
Here's who we are.

976
01:23:36,013 --> 01:23:39,954
So it's kind of the same thing, Jen, that Audrey's looking for.

977
01:23:40,894 --> 01:23:42,294
So that can be used double duty.

978
01:23:42,334 --> 01:23:44,295
I'll just forward that to those guys with a check.

979
01:23:45,255 --> 01:23:46,035
And then we'll just get it.

980
01:23:46,415 --> 01:23:49,216
And hopefully that will bring some new folks in.

981
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:52,397
Do you have a size requirement on that, Doug?

982
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:58,712
Like I know a lot of times for program ads, there's like certain dimensions.

983
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:00,834
Yeah, I'll get it for you.

984
01:24:00,874 --> 01:24:06,678
I think it's usually an eight and a half, 11 and a half size, you know, kind of all over is usually what it is.

985
01:24:07,318 --> 01:24:07,658
Okay.

986
01:24:07,678 --> 01:24:08,899
Just let me, let me know.

987
01:24:09,299 --> 01:24:09,599
Yeah.

988
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,242
Okay.

989
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:13,522
Yeah.

990
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:17,825
I like all these creative visibility things that you guys are coming up with.

991
01:24:18,342 --> 01:24:28,806
Yeah, just so you know, for the future, I know time's an element here, but just for the future, maybe we're all in different organizations and whether it's leisure or business organizations.

992
01:24:28,886 --> 01:24:37,550
So, yeah, if we have like a big gathering that we're going to, we should just have like a generic type of like a half a page flyer.

993
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:44,594
Like six by eight or something, just something that we can hand out like a business card.

994
01:24:44,634 --> 01:24:46,836
Here, this is about the Brooks Estate.

995
01:24:47,476 --> 01:24:48,317
Come check it out.

996
01:24:48,437 --> 01:24:53,920
Yep, we can make those and then Carly have them sit in Canva and then we can just print them as we need them.

997
01:24:54,681 --> 01:24:56,782
Jen, we could ask Ava to help us if you want.

998
01:24:57,403 --> 01:24:57,723
Ava?

999
01:25:00,768 --> 01:25:01,869
Oh, yeah, totally.

1000
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:04,991
Our new little intern.

1001
01:25:05,031 --> 01:25:06,673
We have a social media volunteer.

1002
01:25:06,693 --> 01:25:08,714
She's a 17-year-old.

1003
01:25:09,795 --> 01:25:16,340
We have a 17-year-old young woman from the Groton School who is so smart and so passionate about history.

1004
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:21,784
And she is going to help us with some social media stuff, but she's also really interested in graphic design.

1005
01:25:21,964 --> 01:25:24,927
So we might be activating her in other ways.

1006
01:25:24,967 --> 01:25:25,227
Yeah.

1007
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,429
Like a logo, Doug.

1008
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:29,170
I know.

1009
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,411
I had to say that.

1010
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:32,675
Go get some sleep.

1011
01:25:33,838 --> 01:25:34,319
I'll do my best.

1012
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:36,123
Thank you all for your time tonight, Doug.

1013
01:25:36,163 --> 01:25:37,927
Thank you, thank you, thank you for dialing in.

1014
01:25:38,028 --> 01:25:39,211
This was a really big deal.

1015
01:25:40,674 --> 01:25:44,784
So we will talk soon, and you'll see some emails from me.

1016
01:25:45,506 --> 01:25:45,907
Always.

1017
01:25:45,927 --> 01:25:48,212
I'll be seeing you in your inbox.

1018
01:25:48,753 --> 01:25:49,676
Have a great night, everyone.
