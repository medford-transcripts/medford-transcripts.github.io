    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=90.772s">Naomi</a>  Wells, 26 Curtis Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=98.104s">So</a>  committee members, my name is Annie Wells and I'm here to follow up on an issue of school enrollment from last week regarding kindergarten and first grade for our daughters in a Columbus school. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=108.268s">Last</a>  week we were waiting to hear back from a judgment from a hearing on September 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=113.79s">I</a>  have with me the dismissal of the case without prejudice, meaning the judge did not make a decision on where the children should attend school, meaning there is no court order. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=122.774s">No</a>  court order for Mr. Bellison to be concerned he may be in contempt of. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=127.055s">Furthermore,</a>  Mr. Belson has indicated to the Department of Education that the children are now enrolled and attending North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=132.998s">They</a>  enrolled at both schools prior to Mr. Belson's decision and may be attending Medford if it were not for his decision to bar enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=142.442s">He</a>  indicated in email correspondence to Cheryl Knowles, the legal parent and guardian, that his hope was that the court would resolve the matter on September 6th and that he would be responsive to information directly from the court. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=155.448s">A</a>  temporary arrangement was put in place to split transportation so the children wouldn't miss too much school while all of this was being worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=163.65s">This</a>  is not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=164.55s">I'm</a>  here to report today that they missed school today because the other parent did not want to transport them to North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=173.412s">This</a>  was her day, and if this temporary arrangement was supposed to be working, it didn't work today. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=179.492s">I</a>  know these two parents better than anyone in this room, and although I am biased, I'm very practical and reasonable in my view of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=186.935s">These</a>  parents will or would have worked this out in their own way, on their own time, given that it was a fair, if it's a fair playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=195.619s">If</a>  there's no outside interfering party or blocking enrollment, this will be sorted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=203.34s">Medford</a>  needs to be an option so that they can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=206.801s">It</a>  would not harm Medford Public Schools, the committee, or anyone else in this room, or anyone outside this room, if the children are allowed to be enrolled in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=215.104s">It</a>  is in everyone's best interest that Medford continue to be an option for the children's enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=219.465s">Superintendent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=224.987s">So,</a>  on the 6th of September, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=231.877s">Attorney</a>  for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=233.758s">Knowles</a>  went to court and asked, once again, same question, can we enroll in the Medford Public Schools?</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=244.124s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=244.344s">The</a>  request was for a court order for school.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=249.808s">There's</a>  a piece of paper which I'll provide to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=253.91s">Enroll</a>  to the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=255.231s">It's</a>  a second thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=256.551s">And</a>  it was denied again. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=260.104s">I</a>  don't want to get into a question back and forth about what we can and can't do, because I've taken legal guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and I've taken legal guidance from our own council, Howard Greenspan. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=275.711s">But</a>  more importantly, I was able to get consent to enable to speak to Greg Landry, who is the principal of the Atkinson School in North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=290.476s">And</a>  he has indicated to us that the children are enrolled in North Andover Public Schools as they were in the past.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=296.482s">They're</a>  enrolled in Medford as well, prior to barring enrollment.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=299.165s">Well,</a>  enrolled and attending, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=300.467s">They're</a>  attending the North Andover Public Schools and not out of school.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=304.671s">They</a>  are out today.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=307.567s">We're</a>  not going to go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=309.708s">My</a>  answer is that they're enrolled in a North Andover public school.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=312.57s">That</a>  needs to be the parent's choice with all due respect.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=314.491s">Mr.</a>  Belton has the floor right now and then you'll have an opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=316.372s">Look,</a>  the parents have to work out their arrangement. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=319.394s">We</a>  are not going to work out the arrangement between the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=322.515s">They</a>  have to make the decision among themselves where they want the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=326.978s">That's</a>  what the court has told them repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=329.499s">Work</a>  it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=330.66s">If</a>  they work it out and Medford is the choice, then they will be <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=334.759s">enrolled,</a>  registered in students in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=338.201s">But</a>  right now, the concern was, are they getting an education? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=341.703s">They're</a>  in the North Andover Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=343.924s">And</a>  Principal Landry has confirmed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=346.505s">And</a>  I'm comfortable that they're in the North Andover Public Schools when the parents work at them. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=350.427s">By</a>  the way, this has been going on for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=353.109s">This</a>  isn't something that only came about in the last month. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=356.29s">This</a>  has been going on for an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=360.004s">And</a>  so, you know, they've got to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=362.668s">Maybe</a>  having them in the North Andover Public Schools will bring it to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=367.575s">But</a>  from our standpoint, we've consulted with the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=372.343s">We've</a>  consulted with our legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=375.387s">We've</a>  gone over this matter multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=377.428s">We've</a>  spoken to North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=379.169s">They're</a>  in the North Andover public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=381.15s">If</a>  the parents want a different arrangement, work it out, go to the court together, and get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=386.292s">That's</a>  the way to move on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=388.913s">And</a>  if it happens to be Medford, we'll welcome these kids with open arms, and we'll provide compensatory services.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=393.596s">How</a>  can it be Medford when you said no? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=394.876s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=395.356s">Wells.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=395.616s">Doctor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=396.237s">Doctor</a>  Wells. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=396.897s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=400.119s">If</a>  you'd like to speak.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=401.837s">How</a>  can they work it out if you're barring enrollment? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=405.059s">You're</a>  leaving that, you forced the decision on these two parents, and you favored the other party in saying, go to North Andover.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=412.023s">Didn't</a>  do anything.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=413.945s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=414.485s">You</a>  barred enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=415.505s">I</a>  have the email here saying you've barred enrollment from Medford.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=420.549s">From</a>  our standpoint, the court said that Cheryl Knowles does not have the right <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=429.958s">to</a>  enroll the student in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=433.459s">If</a>  we were to let the student into the Medford Public Schools, we would be aiding and abetting an individual who has been told not to enroll them in the public schools in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=443.64s">Now,</a>  as far as I'm concerned, that's what we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=446.401s">We</a>  consulted with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=448.061s">If</a>  the state had told us you must enroll them, we would have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=452.722s">But</a>  the state actually asked us, I'm going to say this point blank, the state actually asked us to file a 51A. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=459.709s">because</a>  the parents couldn't come to an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=462.55s">We</a>  declined to do that.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=464.171s">The</a>  case has been closed by the Department of Education because you informed them they're going to North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=468.893s">We</a>  are not in agreement with North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=473.155s">It</a>  needs to be an option for Medford to allow them to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=476.756s">They</a>  would have gone to Medford today.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=480.202s">So</a>  we would have had an objection from the other side as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=483.183s">Yes,</a>  but that's not yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=485.144s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=485.404s">So</a>  it's not our issue to argue with you one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=487.584s">Get</a>  together, solve the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=489.625s">Just</a>  say yes, Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=490.285s">And</a>  whatever you solve the issue, the children will be enrolled.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=492.246s">We</a>  will if you say yes.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=493.786s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=494.167s">It's</a>  not me to say yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=496.007s">It's</a>  for you to solve it with the court.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=498.348s">We</a>  can't if you say no.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=500.609s">Yes,</a>  you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=502.109s">Yes,</a>  you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=502.569s">Because</a>  the court wants you to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=504.873s">If</a>  I look at this document, this is the last one that came through, look over the card. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=508.515s">The</a>  court denied it again.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=510.677s">Dismissed</a>  the case, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=512.298s">If</a>  you read it over, it's a request for the court to make an order for any court district, any district, including other ones we would be willing to move to, because Medford has said no to us.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=523.745s">We</a>  have our attorney present, Mr. Greenspan. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=525.666s">Could</a>  you please step forward?</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=537.597s">Mayor</a>  and the committee, you asked me after last week's meeting to follow up and get some additional information regarding this matter, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=546.724s">I'm</a>  in receipt of a ruling by the Essex County Probate Court, which came in last week, relative to a motion to establish school enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=566.28s">uh,</a>  which was brought by, uh, Cheryl Knowles in the Essex County Probate Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=572.385s">Uh,</a>  the motion, uh, stated that, uh, or requested that the court order school enrollment in one of the towns within a reasonable commute to Cheryl's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=589.919s">Uh,</a>  she had requested, uh, that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=597.018s">The</a>  court ordered that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=599.539s">The</a>  court made a decision on September 6, 2017 and denied the request.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=610.241s">Denied</a>  without prejudice the determination of the merits.</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=613.882s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=614.982s">So</a>  the request for temporary relief filed by the plaintiff in this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=623.099s">was</a>  denied by a judge in the Essex County Probate Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=629.064s">From</a>  my review of the court records, this is the second time the Essex County Probate Court denied the relief to this plaintiff. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=643.136s">The</a>  first one, I believe, was to request an order that they be enrolled in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=652.023s">So</a>  a judge has ruled on this twice, both times not in favor of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=659.249s">Knowles.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=661.17s">And</a>  it would be my recommendation that until there's a further order of the court that the Medford Public Schools respect the order of the Essex County Probate Court until either a trial on the merits <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=680.838s">or</a>  any other further rulings of the court.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=683.859s">Can</a>  I ask one question? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=686.119s">At</a>  any point during the probate and plea court hearings throughout the course of separation, I don't know what transpired previously, was there ever a ruling or an order that they had to go to North Andover?</p>
