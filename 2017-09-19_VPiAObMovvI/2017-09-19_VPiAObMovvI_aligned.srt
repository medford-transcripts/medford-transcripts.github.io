1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,663
The regular meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:05,004
The secretary will call the roll.

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:07,988
Mrs. Cuneo?

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:08,869
Here.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,532
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

6
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,373
Present.

7
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:12,654
Mrs. Kress?

8
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:13,015
Here.

9
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:14,277
Mrs. McStone?

10
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:14,757
Here.

11
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:15,779
Mr. Scurry?

12
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:16,594
Present.

13
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:17,955
Mrs. Vander Kloot?

14
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:19,096
Yes.

15
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:19,857
Mayor Burke?

16
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:20,417
Yes.

17
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:21,839
Seven present, none absent.

18
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:23,400
All please rise and salute our flag.

19
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:36,731
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:38,104
Mayor Burke.

21
00:00:38,924 --> 00:00:39,084
Ms.

22
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:39,665
Van de Kloot.

23
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:48,667
I'd like to also acknowledge that we have a non-voting member but our student representative Sebastian Tringali with us today.

24
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:50,028
Welcome Sebastian.

25
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:52,048
Thank you so much for being here with us this evening.

26
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:56,510
Let the records officially reflect Sebastian's presence please.

27
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:03,302
The first item, approval of minutes of September 11th, 2017.

28
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:07,506
Motion approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

29
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:08,466
Stone.

30
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:09,567
All those in favor?

31
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:10,508
Aye.

32
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:11,509
All those opposed?

33
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:12,630
Motion passes.

34
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:15,472
Approval of bills, transfer of funds?

35
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:15,873
None.

36
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:16,293
Approval.

37
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:16,834
None.

38
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:17,954
Approval of payrolls?

39
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:18,355
None.

40
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:20,737
Report of secretary?

41
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:21,457
There is none.

42
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:22,038
None.

43
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:23,459
Report of committees?

44
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,160
None.

45
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:26,242
Community participation?

46
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:30,752
Your name and address, please.

47
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:32,196
Naomi Wells, 26 Curtis Street.

48
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:47,548
So committee members, my name is Annie Wells and I'm here to follow up on an issue of school enrollment from last week regarding kindergarten and first grade for our daughters in a Columbus school.

49
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:52,670
Last week we were waiting to hear back from a judgment from a hearing on September 6th.

50
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:02,273
I have with me the dismissal of the case without prejudice, meaning the judge did not make a decision on where the children should attend school, meaning there is no court order.

51
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:05,915
No court order for Mr. Bellison to be concerned he may be in contempt of.

52
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:12,497
Furthermore, Mr. Belson has indicated to the Department of Education that the children are now enrolled and attending North Andover.

53
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:21,181
They enrolled at both schools prior to Mr. Belson's decision and may be attending Medford if it were not for his decision to bar enrollment.

54
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:34,307
He indicated in email correspondence to Cheryl Knowles, the legal parent and guardian, that his hope was that the court would resolve the matter on September 6th and that he would be responsive to information directly from the court.

55
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:42,109
A temporary arrangement was put in place to split transportation so the children wouldn't miss too much school while all of this was being worked out.

56
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,390
This is not working.

57
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:52,232
I'm here to report today that they missed school today because the other parent did not want to transport them to North Andover.

58
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:58,313
This was her day, and if this temporary arrangement was supposed to be working, it didn't work today.

59
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:06,395
I know these two parents better than anyone in this room, and although I am biased, I'm very practical and reasonable in my view of things.

60
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:14,558
These parents will or would have worked this out in their own way, on their own time, given that it was a fair, if it's a fair playing field.

61
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:20,781
If there's no outside interfering party or blocking enrollment, this will be sorted out.

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,961
Medford needs to be an option so that they can do this.

63
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:34,604
It would not harm Medford Public Schools, the committee, or anyone else in this room, or anyone outside this room, if the children are allowed to be enrolled in Medford Public Schools.

64
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:39,445
It is in everyone's best interest that Medford continue to be an option for the children's enrollment.

65
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:43,086
Superintendent.

66
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:50,009
So, on the 6th of September, I believe,

67
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:53,738
Attorney for Ms.

68
00:03:53,758 --> 00:04:03,664
Knowles went to court and asked, once again, same question, can we enroll in the Medford Public Schools?

69
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:04,284
No.

70
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,746
The request was for a court order for school.

71
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:12,349
There's a piece of paper which I'll provide to the committee.

72
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,071
Enroll to the public schools.

73
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:16,511
It's a second thing.

74
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:17,492
And it was denied again.

75
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:33,710
I don't want to get into a question back and forth about what we can and can't do, because I've taken legal guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and I've taken legal guidance from our own council, Howard Greenspan.

76
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:49,757
But more importantly, I was able to get consent to enable to speak to Greg Landry, who is the principal of the Atkinson School in North Andover.

77
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:55,982
And he has indicated to us that the children are enrolled in North Andover Public Schools as they were in the past.

78
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:59,145
They're enrolled in Medford as well, prior to barring enrollment.

79
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,447
Well, enrolled and attending, okay?

80
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,770
They're attending the North Andover Public Schools and not out of school.

81
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,312
They are out today.

82
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,388
We're not going to go back and forth.

83
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,550
My answer is that they're enrolled in a North Andover public school.

84
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,471
That needs to be the parent's choice with all due respect.

85
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:16,352
Mr. Belton has the floor right now and then you'll have an opportunity.

86
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:18,873
Look, the parents have to work out their arrangement.

87
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:22,455
We are not going to work out the arrangement between the parents.

88
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:26,958
They have to make the decision among themselves where they want the children.

89
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:28,779
That's what the court has told them repeatedly.

90
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:30,000
Work it out.

91
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,122
If they work it out and Medford is the choice, then they will be

92
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,681
enrolled, registered in students in the Medford Public Schools.

93
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:41,262
But right now, the concern was, are they getting an education?

94
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:43,384
They're in the North Andover Public Schools.

95
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:45,905
And Principal Landry has confirmed that.

96
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:50,407
And I'm comfortable that they're in the North Andover Public Schools when the parents work at them.

97
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:53,089
By the way, this has been going on for a long time.

98
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:55,930
This isn't something that only came about in the last month.

99
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,212
This has been going on for an extended period of time.

100
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:02,107
And so, you know, they've got to work it out.

101
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:06,874
Maybe having them in the North Andover Public Schools will bring it to a head.

102
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:11,702
But from our standpoint, we've consulted with the Department of Education.

103
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:14,646
We've consulted with our legal counsel.

104
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:17,388
We've gone over this matter multiple times.

105
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:18,769
We've spoken to North Andover.

106
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,810
They're in the North Andover public schools.

107
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,912
If the parents want a different arrangement, work it out, go to the court together, and get it done.

108
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,573
That's the way to move on the issue.

109
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:33,576
And if it happens to be Medford, we'll welcome these kids with open arms, and we'll provide compensatory services.

110
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:34,836
How can it be Medford when you said no?

111
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:34,976
Ms.

112
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:35,536
Wells.

113
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:35,917
Doctor.

114
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:36,797
Doctor Wells.

115
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,237
Thank you.

116
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:40,759
If you'd like to speak.

117
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:44,819
How can they work it out if you're barring enrollment?

118
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:52,003
You're leaving that, you forced the decision on these two parents, and you favored the other party in saying, go to North Andover.

119
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:53,844
Didn't do anything.

120
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:54,405
You did.

121
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:55,465
You barred enrollment.

122
00:06:55,505 --> 00:07:00,509
I have the email here saying you've barred enrollment from Medford.

123
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:08,874
From our standpoint, the court said that Cheryl Knowles does not have the right

124
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,758
to enroll the student in the Medford Public Schools.

125
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:23,100
If we were to let the student into the Medford Public Schools, we would be aiding and abetting an individual who has been told not to enroll them in the public schools in Medford.

126
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,961
Now, as far as I'm concerned, that's what we've done.

127
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:27,661
We consulted with the state.

128
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:32,002
If the state had told us you must enroll them, we would have done it.

129
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:37,963
But the state actually asked us, I'm going to say this point blank, the state actually asked us to file a 51A.

130
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,110
because the parents couldn't come to an agreement.

131
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,591
We declined to do that.

132
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:48,493
The case has been closed by the Department of Education because you informed them they're going to North Andover.

133
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:51,034
We are not in agreement with North Andover.

134
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:56,736
It needs to be an option for Medford to allow them to take it.

135
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:57,877
They would have gone to Medford today.

136
00:08:00,202 --> 00:08:02,703
So we would have had an objection from the other side as well.

137
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,563
Yes, but that's not yours.

138
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:05,344
Right.

139
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:07,544
So it's not our issue to argue with you one way.

140
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:09,605
Get together, solve the issue.

141
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,265
Just say yes, Mr. Belson.

142
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,226
And whatever you solve the issue, the children will be enrolled.

143
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:13,306
We will if you say yes.

144
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:14,047
No, no.

145
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,367
It's not me to say yes.

146
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:18,068
It's for you to solve it with the court.

147
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:19,748
We can't if you say no.

148
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:21,109
Yes, you can.

149
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:22,529
Yes, you can.

150
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,050
Because the court wants you to work it out.

151
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:28,495
If I look at this document, this is the last one that came through, look over the card.

152
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:29,836
The court denied it again.

153
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,957
Dismissed the case, sir.

154
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:42,504
If you read it over, it's a request for the court to make an order for any court district, any district, including other ones we would be willing to move to, because Medford has said no to us.

155
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:45,646
We have our attorney present, Mr. Greenspan.

156
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,727
Could you please step forward?

157
00:08:57,597 --> 00:09:05,543
Mayor and the committee, you asked me after last week's meeting to follow up and get some additional information regarding this matter, which I did.

158
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:25,159
I'm in receipt of a ruling by the Essex County Probate Court, which came in last week, relative to a motion to establish school enrollment.

159
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,204
uh, which was brought by, uh, Cheryl Knowles in the Essex County Probate Court.

160
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:48,397
Uh, the motion, uh, stated that, uh, or requested that the court order school enrollment in one of the towns within a reasonable commute to Cheryl's work.

161
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,383
Uh, she had requested, uh, that, uh,

162
00:09:57,018 --> 00:09:58,118
The court ordered that.

163
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:08,681
The court made a decision on September 6, 2017 and denied the request.

164
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:13,682
Denied without prejudice the determination of the merits.

165
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:14,342
Correct.

166
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:22,284
So the request for temporary relief filed by the plaintiff in this matter.

167
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:26,902
was denied by a judge in the Essex County Probate Court.

168
00:10:29,064 --> 00:10:42,055
From my review of the court records, this is the second time the Essex County Probate Court denied the relief to this plaintiff.

169
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:51,263
The first one, I believe, was to request an order that they be enrolled in Medford.

170
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:59,209
So a judge has ruled on this twice, both times not in favor of Ms.

171
00:10:59,249 --> 00:10:59,689
Knowles.

172
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:19,865
And it would be my recommendation that until there's a further order of the court that the Medford Public Schools respect the order of the Essex County Probate Court until either a trial on the merits

173
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:22,718
or any other further rulings of the court.

174
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:24,979
Can I ask one question?

175
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:38,881
At any point during the probate and plea court hearings throughout the course of separation, I don't know what transpired previously, was there ever a ruling or an order that they had to go to North Andover?

176
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:41,442
I don't know.

177
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:43,262
I don't believe so, but I don't know.

178
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:45,002
There is not.

179
00:11:46,843 --> 00:11:47,903
So this did go to trial?

180
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:55,299
And the determination of the trial that was in March was for the parents to decide and to go to mediation, which they did.

181
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:59,082
And as you can see by the motion for the hearing, they were unable to come to an agreement.

182
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:01,304
And again, like I said, I know these parents well.

183
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:07,650
They will and would work it out if there was an even playing field and there was no forced

184
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:25,379
Forced decision to go to a district that is not an option but for March through September they weren't able to reach a Decision on their own which is why they're Asking the court to intervene.

185
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:27,360
Exactly and the court is not gonna touch it.

186
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:36,085
So I don't know why Mr. Belson feels that he is above a judge in making a decision on where they should go Mayor I just

187
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:50,104
I think Mr. Belson has stated that he would welcome the enrollment of these children once this matter is resolved in the Essex County Probate Court.

188
00:12:50,384 --> 00:13:02,969
Specifically, in May of 2017, the motion was, the request was to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools specifically.

189
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,909
That was brought in May of 2017.

190
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:16,295
Judge Ordonez denied that motion that specifically requested that the children be enrolled in Medford.

191
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,915
That was denied.

192
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:30,459
There was a additional motion filed on and ruled on again this September, which denied the relief sought by Ms.

193
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:31,279
Knowles.

194
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:35,140
So until there is a trial on the merits,

195
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:49,663
or any other rulings by the court, I would recommend that these children not be enrolled in Medford until further order of the court.

196
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:58,149
With all due respect, Mr. Greenspan, the court has made it clear they are not going to make a decision on school district.

197
00:13:58,489 --> 00:13:59,610
There's not gonna be a trial.

198
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:02,532
They're done.

199
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:05,654
They're not ordering a district.

200
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:06,155
Ms.

201
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:06,635
Mustone.

202
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:12,849
The parent in North Andover, is she willing to unenroll them in North Andover to enroll them here?

203
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,590
They will work it out.

204
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:29,459
If she was unwilling to drive, she was unwilling to drive to Medford to bring them to school today because of the distance and her unwillingness to move and do other, we've offered private school, we've offered in the middle, we've offered to do the transporting and meet in the middle.

205
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:35,203
We've offered many accommodations to her and all she wants is to have them in her district, not have to drive,

206
00:14:35,703 --> 00:14:37,926
and to not be accountable to anything.

207
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:44,415
So she's not really willing to compromise, but if Medfar was an option, I assure you, there would be an agreement.

208
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:57,294
They worked things out in their own way, and if both schools were an option, she would probably not want to drive to Medford to pick them up.

209
00:14:57,534 --> 00:14:59,395
Five days a week, because they're with us five days a week.

210
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:08,838
Please understand from our point of view how confusing this is, because if in fact the other parent was just willing for them to come to Medford, we'd have no issue.

211
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:11,339
It would be not an issue.

212
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,900
The superintendent wouldn't,

213
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:16,074
there would be not an issue.

214
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:23,178
So clearly, there is an issue, because the other parent does not want them to come to Medford, and they've already been in Andover.

215
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,979
And we are not okay with North Andover, but North Andover didn't say no.

216
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,641
The only reason they're North Andover is because they didn't say no.

217
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:30,662
So we're not agreeing with North Andover.

218
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:33,043
But they were in North Andover last year, correct?

219
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:35,445
No, kindergarten, she was in pre-kindergarten.

220
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:36,685
In North Andover.

221
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:42,849
So pre-k she was in Wilmington, and Avery attended kindergarten at Atkinson.

222
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:51,401
Temporarily until the trial in March So can you see the I am because they see the imbalance for a minute.

223
00:15:51,422 --> 00:16:01,535
Let me just explain it this way The judge has a statement about not allowing them to enroll in men from the judge makes no statement about not allowing them to enroll in North and over

224
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:09,177
The judge has maybe not made a clean decision that you would like, but he's clearly implied something at this point in time.

225
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:15,020
I'm not gonna try and get in the middle of a domestic dispute on this situation, as long as the kids are in school.

226
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:16,061
They're in school.

227
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,403
Mr. Benedetto?

228
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:22,585
I had a similar question to my colleague.

229
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:31,852
So my own question is, if someone had not petitioned for a specific district,

230
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:36,389
then both parents would be on even still.

231
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:42,634
But because one parent petitioned the court for a judgment, that's the difference.

232
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:49,520
Like if the other parent had done, had asked the court to enroll them in North Andover, the judge might have said no, not North Andover.

233
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,661
But that didn't happen.

234
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:58,928
So we're like, had it not been asked specifically, can we ask, then it would be, we wouldn't have documents.

235
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:00,209
It was, can we have a court order?

236
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,809
Right.

237
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:04,158
Parents decide, right?

238
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:06,939
Parents decide where to send their kids all the time.

239
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:14,842
And if you don't want to be involved with all due respect, just please unbar their enrollment so that we can work this out.

240
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,144
I assure you, it will be fine.

241
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:20,625
Whether it's North End or Medford, we will let you know, but this needs to be a yes.

242
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:20,685
Ms.

243
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:23,246
Cunha.

244
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:29,845
First of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused.

245
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:43,776
I'm reading from the documentation that you just provided to us, okay, and I'm not gonna say names, but I'm reading and it says, you keep on saying that if the superintendent,

246
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:46,858
says, okay, my fit is fine, they'll work it out.

247
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:47,499
Yes, they will.

248
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:57,627
But on the other hand, I'm reading this, and when you come to number six, it says, a parent had reasonable in proposing numerous towns closest to the other parent's work.

249
00:17:57,987 --> 00:17:58,408
We did.

250
00:17:58,528 --> 00:17:58,888
Okay.

251
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,190
And it's currently in certain places.

252
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,814
One of the parties, the children have gone to daycare in Wilmington, as you just said.

253
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:10,718
However, it does say that the parent who is in North Andover,

254
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:18,194
Refuses to leave North the Andover and insists the children be involved in school there.

255
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:38,768
So two days a week No, but it doesn't say that I'm just going by what you're telling us that's on the documentation So what I guess my thing is is that you're standing here telling us that you know, we want to we want to Understand where you're coming from, but you're saying that if we take this this bar or term that you're using off of Medford and

256
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:42,347
then the parents would come to an agreement.

257
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:51,153
But here in the documentation from the court that you just provided says that that person, no matter what you provide, is going to refuse.

258
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:57,978
So you have to understand this, they have a history of going through the courts for a lot of things.

259
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:59,739
The court, their file is very thick.

260
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,981
And they aren't going to resolve things in court.

261
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,362
They resolve things in their own way.

262
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:05,683
I've been witness to this.

263
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:31,717
It works for them eventually, but you can't decide for them that it's gonna be North Danover because you've given her you've given her a lot of Freedom and now she's going to go and file for having custody during the week and right now they have them five days but it doesn't even say that because it says that there are other cities in towns that the other parent is willing to move to and

264
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,042
including Wilmington, North Reading, Wakefield and Reading, which is much closer than Medford.

265
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:46,046
And again, you still have the other party who says it doesn't really matter because they're not gonna move out of there, or they're not willing to bring the children enrolled in those cities.

266
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:57,511
So that's, I mean, it's confusing to us because you're saying, well, if they didn't have the rule or the documentation or going to trial, then they'll come to their own term.

267
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:04,095
So right now she's got there's no reason for her to work with us because There's a note from Medford.

268
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:05,896
So why should she have to give on anything?

269
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:19,805
But you don't have a note from Wilmington or North Reading already live there No, but what I'm saying is that I'm just going by what you're saying and that is that even if we opened up Medford according to the documentation that you have given us from the court

270
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:27,991
that you provided, it says that the other party refuses to leave North Andover and insists the children be enrolled in school there.

271
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:30,653
I'm reading it from the documentation that you provided.

272
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,135
So if there's any other, you know.

273
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:35,317
Support, that's the motion.

274
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:36,938
That's the motion, right.

275
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,943
Demonstrating that we've made many offers to move in the same district together, private school, et cetera, et cetera.

276
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:44,704
We've made options.

277
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:46,005
Right, and they've refused.

278
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,287
Right, so now we're just Medford versus North Andover right now.

279
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:52,704
So let me ask this, OK?

280
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:57,747
Because we're all trying to solve this, but we have different viewpoints on how we look at it, OK?

281
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:01,489
Lisa Greenberg is your attorney.

282
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:03,570
She's filed the motion.

283
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,852
If she thought that we didn't have

284
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:09,978
a solid position, she'd be in our face.

285
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:11,419
But she's not.

286
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,659
You're coming here.

287
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:14,399
She costs $300 an hour, sir.

288
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,920
But you know what?

289
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,020
She's the legal representative for you.

290
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,361
You know what I mean?

291
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:21,021
Mia, I'm calling you because you're not taking our calls.

292
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:21,401
Not call.

293
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:22,421
You're saying sue us.

294
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:23,162
I'm sorry?

295
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,842
You're saying if she sued us.

296
00:21:24,882 --> 00:21:25,302
Well, no.

297
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:31,283
Look, if she's got a position that she thinks she can sustain, then she should be here.

298
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:33,984
But I called the Department of Education.

299
00:21:34,944 --> 00:21:37,445
And I sat down with them and I said, tell me what to do.

300
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:42,787
They went over it and quite frankly, they sustained our position.

301
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:54,474
So believe me, if I had a kid outside that wasn't enrolled, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would tell me to enroll that kid if it was my opportunity to do so.

302
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:56,294
Believe me, they would not let me.

303
00:21:57,075 --> 00:21:59,436
We've been through this many times with Desi.

304
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:02,598
If there's a kid out there that needs to be enrolled,

305
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:09,071
Even if they're an undocumented immigrant, I'm going to put it that way, they would tell us to enroll them and not check anything else.

306
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:13,601
So the fact that they have not taken a position on this thing gives me great concern.

307
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:28,067
And they said we closed it because you informed them they were enrolled and everybody's happy with North Andover.

308
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:34,648
Well, I did that today because I got a note from Greg Landry, who's the principal at Atkinson, says they're enrolled.

309
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:36,448
But that doesn't mean we agree with that.

310
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,049
You spoke to Dessie last week as well.

311
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:39,189
I spoke to Dessie today too.

312
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,770
What about us?

313
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,390
What about our disagreement with North Vandenberg?

314
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,632
What about the fact that the kids would be commuting five days a week back and forth?

315
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:49,653
The fact that they didn't go to school today because their parent didn't pick them up.

316
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:50,994
An unreliable parent didn't pick them up.

317
00:22:51,894 --> 00:22:53,555
What is your responsibility to us?

318
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:04,500
I've got to take some guidance from an impartial group out there, whether it's, it can't be you and it can't be the other person, Nicole Denning.

319
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,785
It's got to be a decision made by a third party, and I'll be happy to do it.

320
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:15,310
We would be more than happy to enroll the children if we had the go-ahead, but we don't.

321
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:16,590
Ms.

322
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,911
Van De Kloot.

323
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:22,995
Do you have any paper or court order on your custody arrangements?

324
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:30,000
The one thing we've never seen is what your custom custody order is, which says that the children are with you Monday through Friday.

325
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,442
So it's a 50-50 schedule, but as you can see from the email,

326
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:41,130
I think she's asking for something legal from the court system that talks about custody, not an email chain.

327
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,052
That's going to be her until December.

328
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:44,774
She's petitioning to try to get them.

329
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:45,915
The one you have in place right now.

330
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:50,219
Wednesday, Thursday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

331
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,561
So a 50-50 schedule.

332
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:55,364
However, she does not, she switched her work schedule, so she works weekends.

333
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:59,328
The children are now with us on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

334
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:02,071
And we're running more than two of them.

335
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:05,174
So on Monday and Tuesday, they would be?

336
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:06,195
In with her.

337
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:08,752
they would be living in North Andover.

338
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:16,597
So the problem that we have is they are not with us sleeping in Medford the five school days.

339
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:17,218
Does it matter?

340
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:29,325
Cheryl coaches soccer, both teams, 12 to three, both kids.

341
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:34,609
They have friends in the community, they go to school, they go to park and the kids say, hey, what class are you in?

342
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,451
And it's quite troublesome.

343
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:40,754
All of their social activities are here in Medford, this is where they live.

344
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:45,878
These parents will work out the school issue and transportation if you just let us do it on our time.

345
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:50,363
I don't, Mr. Greenspan, could you be just clear?

346
00:24:50,743 --> 00:25:02,947
No, the only thing I can say is that there was a specific request, again in May, requesting to enroll the children in Medford.

347
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:04,288
That was denied.

348
00:25:04,948 --> 00:25:08,209
The court has again denied any change in these orders.

349
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,451
Most current is September, obviously, not May.

350
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,372
Right, there was an original,

351
00:25:16,144 --> 00:25:26,453
request in May, and a motion was made in May to specifically ask the court to make an order to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools.

352
00:25:27,454 --> 00:25:30,757
Specifically, the motion was denied.

353
00:25:31,257 --> 00:25:38,263
There was another request to modify that in September of 2017, denied again.

354
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:44,028
So until there is some further clarification or a ruling at trial,

355
00:25:45,998 --> 00:26:02,554
I would recommend strongly that the committee not enroll or order these children enrolled in Medford until there is further court orders to that effect or an agreement by the parties.

356
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,561
We can get you an agreement.

357
00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:06,722
If you say yes to Medford, we'll get you an agreement.

358
00:26:07,142 --> 00:26:09,683
If you got an agreement, you'd get yes to Medford.

359
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:12,105
That's where the quagmire we're in right now.

360
00:26:12,165 --> 00:26:22,310
They would have been in Medford today, and if they'd be in Medford Wednesday when we have them, on Thursday, and Friday, and she was tired of driving back and forth from Northland to Medford, she would give in, and in Medford it would be.

361
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,952
So let me just say one more thing.

362
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:28,614
My own gut tells me the following.

363
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,089
It's not scientific, but my own gut tells me the following.

364
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:38,953
The reality is, is the court probably is saying, one child was in North Andover last year.

365
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:43,256
Leave them there, because quite frankly, they've got some stability there.

366
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:47,629
The other child, okay, so there's two together.

367
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:58,035
And what we're facing right now, we're facing a situation where this party would like them to be enrolled in Medford, because then you go back to the court and say, guess what, they're in Medford.

368
00:26:58,656 --> 00:27:00,216
So we're gonna play one off against the other.

369
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:09,202
The reality here is that if you told the court, my suggestion, you told the court that Medford is willing, if in fact,

370
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:14,076
The court will make a decision, and you've got the same leverage you would have otherwise.

371
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:17,279
We are willing to enroll these children if we get a go-ahead.

372
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:17,759
That's all.

373
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,181
We're not against it.

374
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:21,023
We like children.

375
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:21,763
We like enrollment.

376
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:25,267
North Andover didn't wait for a go-ahead, and because you said no, it has to be North Andover.

377
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:26,208
Do you get this?

378
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:28,350
North Andover didn't need a go-ahead.

379
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,771
We live in the district.

380
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:31,433
Why are you saying no?

381
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:36,313
We're at a council, I tell you.

382
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:43,397
Council keeps saying the same thing over and over again, which is that no court made an order, and he's saying he doesn't recommend it, but there's no court order saying they can't go to Medford.

383
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:44,877
What is it?

384
00:27:45,818 --> 00:27:52,261
There's a court order denying, denying enrollment in the Medford public school.

385
00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:53,842
I have the order.

386
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:54,923
Please read it to us.

387
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:57,324
I don't have to, I've read it to myself.

388
00:27:57,784 --> 00:27:58,845
The committee has it.

389
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:02,547
The court has denied the order in May.

390
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:04,889
Denied an order.

391
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:07,550
It's been revisited again in September.

392
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,590
They've denied that again.

393
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:15,812
The superintendent has stated that he is willing to enroll these children.

394
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:26,794
If you have an agreement or a court order, either way, if there is an agreement between the parents or a court order modifying

395
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:36,113
What's been and what is in front of us now, the superintendent has stated he's willing to enroll these children in the Medford Public Schools.

396
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:50,467
And my recommendation, again, is to wait either for a order from the trial on the merits or until there's a reversal of this motion or until there is an agreement.

397
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:53,518
Will there be an agreement if Medford says no?

398
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,239
Medford has not said no.

399
00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:05,382
Medford is willing to enroll these children if this court order is modified or is there an agreement between the parties.

400
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:12,951
If the two parents agree, we will take the children.

401
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:15,633
How can they agree if she has no reason to agree?

402
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:20,596
If she's not willing to drive back and forth to get the kids to school, clearly she... In the meantime, they're out?

403
00:29:21,497 --> 00:29:23,118
I mean, like, when she doesn't want to drive down here?

404
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:24,459
Point of information, ma'am?

405
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:25,299
Ms.

406
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:25,639
Harry.

407
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,523
Dr., reading through the documents that you presented us, mediation was suggested by the courts.

408
00:29:31,763 --> 00:29:32,084
It failed.

409
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,024
What happened in mediation?

410
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:33,865
That it failed.

411
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:38,127
The parties went to mediation and could not reach an agreement.

412
00:29:38,347 --> 00:29:44,649
So Cheryl, my partner, offered to change the schedule for her request if she was willing to go to Medford schools.

413
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,591
She didn't want to compromise on anything.

414
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,552
What did the original custody agreement?

415
00:29:51,812 --> 00:29:56,637
The original custody agreement is she has them Monday and Tuesday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

416
00:29:56,938 --> 00:29:58,059
Cheryl had them Monday and Tuesday?

417
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:58,860
No, Nicole.

418
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,520
Oh, okay.

419
00:29:59,761 --> 00:30:03,364
And then we have them Wednesday, Thursday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

420
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:05,006
What 50-50, five and two?

421
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:05,226
50-50.

422
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:06,648
Could I follow up?

423
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:06,828
Ms.

424
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,208
Cunha.

425
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:08,329
Thank you, Doctor.

426
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,693
When we first spoke, and up until just a little while ago,

427
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:19,458
You had said to me, I know personally, you had said to me that you had the Monday through Friday, because the children could go to school Monday through Friday.

428
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,138
Five days a week.

429
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:22,259
Okay, well five days a week.

430
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,742
Is Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, five days a week.

431
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:27,102
Not every week.

432
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:27,783
Every week.

433
00:30:27,803 --> 00:30:28,423
Since March.

434
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:30,184
But they don't go to school on Saturday and Sunday.

435
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:41,612
Right, but there's... So what I'm trying to find out, I'm just trying to find out, if they have them on Monday and Tuesday, and you have them every other week,

436
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,262
And then you have a Monday, Thursday, and Friday.

437
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:51,389
Even if we said yes, and the other parent doesn't want to bring them down, so how are we going to work that?

438
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:52,650
I mean, I'm really confused.

439
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:56,915
Do we not put the children in school for two days out of the week and let them go to another district?

440
00:30:58,282 --> 00:31:07,547
I assure you, if they were in Medford Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and North Ender would not allow them to go to school Monday and Tuesdays only, they would say, hey, your kids are missing too much school.

441
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:08,508
And guess what?

442
00:31:08,588 --> 00:31:10,049
Three days out of the week is more than two.

443
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,510
They would be going to Medford.

444
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,350
Three days.

445
00:31:13,611 --> 00:31:16,853
Well, no, five, because she doesn't want to transport on Mondays, apparently, either.

446
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:17,933
So four days.

447
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:24,097
But if she doesn't want to drop them off, then how would they even get, like, because you said they missed school today, because she didn't want to drop them.

448
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:25,258
This is beyond what I can do.

449
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:49,950
We're trying to understand it with a few pieces of paper when you have a whole file at home, so just please bear with us And also this isn't something that really should be discussed in front of every person in the city of Medford it really is a private matter and I Highly advise that if we need to continue this that we go into executive session for the respect of your family I would be happy to turn my phone calls I

450
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:54,788
I called the office, I leave messages, I don't hear back.

451
00:31:54,828 --> 00:32:02,272
So if I could get a meeting with Mr. Bellison and yourself, that would be great, and maybe our attorneys, I would look at that.

452
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:04,212
So let me just say one more thing.

453
00:32:04,693 --> 00:32:10,936
And I don't know your status, but as far as I know, you're a significant other but not a custodial parent.

454
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:11,856
Am I right?

455
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,016
I'm not a custodial parent, no.

456
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:15,798
Okay, so as a result, I can't talk to you about the child technically.

457
00:32:16,178 --> 00:32:17,579
Well, with permission you can.

458
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,159
Yeah, well, I don't have that.

459
00:32:19,219 --> 00:32:20,420
No one gave me that permission yet.

460
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,469
I mean, so you know this this is a complicated little circle here.

461
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,834
I mean, this is it's filled with all kinds of

462
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:31,108
of things that we can and can't do.

463
00:32:32,028 --> 00:32:42,652
So if the court had said, you know, you can put them in part-time, but the court is probably saying I don't want to split the week up for these kids.

464
00:32:42,972 --> 00:32:44,672
Let them be in one place and not in two places.

465
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:45,773
That's the problem with it.

466
00:32:45,953 --> 00:32:46,993
Right.

467
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:48,554
It wouldn't work for either party.

468
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:50,134
So I move that the

469
00:32:53,276 --> 00:33:00,864
Party before us meets with the significant other and attorneys or whoever is appropriate and the mayor and superintendent.

470
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,808
Seconded on the motion roll call vote, please.

471
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,059
Mrs. Cuneo?

472
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:08,700
Yes.

473
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

474
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,360
Yes.

475
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:11,181
Mrs. Kretz?

476
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:11,961
Yes.

477
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:13,062
Mrs. McStone?

478
00:33:13,262 --> 00:33:13,462
Yes.

479
00:33:13,682 --> 00:33:14,262
Mr. Scurry?

480
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:14,502
Yes.

481
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:15,383
Mrs. Vander Kloot?

482
00:33:15,403 --> 00:33:15,623
Yes.

483
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:16,103
Mayor Burke?

484
00:33:16,343 --> 00:33:16,563
Yes.

485
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:17,984
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

486
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:18,764
Motion passes.

487
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,305
Report of superintendent.

488
00:33:21,385 --> 00:33:23,806
Report on Team Medford's supply drive.

489
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:29,589
Mayor and members of the committee, we're going to call upon our deputy superintendent to take the lead on this.

490
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:36,312
It's a very significant occasion for Team Medford, and I'm going to let her do it because it's an important thing.

491
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:39,590
Again, we're here with our team.

492
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,952
I'm going to ask our team to come up with me.

493
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:44,835
It's a very special occasion.

494
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:48,298
This is the 10th year we're having an anniversary tonight.

495
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:54,984
We have a cake to celebrate our 10th anniversary.

496
00:33:55,865 --> 00:33:57,486
I made it, yes, at Market Basket, yes.

497
00:33:57,727 --> 00:33:59,028
We do great work together.

498
00:33:59,648 --> 00:34:02,810
But once again, we are indebted to Team Medford.

499
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,032
Sam Terabelsi every year comes through.

500
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:13,377
Of course, I know he would, because I also discovered we went to the same high school, Watertown High School, which I didn't know until this year.

501
00:34:13,957 --> 00:34:15,318
So we've learned good things there.

502
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:19,801
But I'm going to ask Sam to come up and introduce his team that's with him tonight.

503
00:34:20,621 --> 00:34:23,762
We, every year, go over the previous year amount.

504
00:34:23,802 --> 00:34:28,504
This year was $28,000, with Staples being our prime donator.

505
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:37,548
But again, a lot of constituents participated in this, and we have, as a result, school supplies that arrived before the first day of school.

506
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:39,429
Principals picked them up.

507
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:42,370
Students had them in their hands the first day of school.

508
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:46,192
So we are indebted to Sam, and I will let him speak, and then we'll have cake.

509
00:34:46,992 --> 00:34:47,293
Yay!

510
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:50,245
Thank you so much, Beverly.

511
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:52,487
So yeah, 10 years.

512
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:53,467
Wow.

513
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:07,257
Imagine the idea of just came in as part of our sort of as we started this committee, about 16 of us and sitting thinking what else can we do with the with the city?

514
00:35:07,998 --> 00:35:10,640
How do we connect the hospital with the city?

515
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:17,423
And certainly, our thoughts were more with the school programs, which I've known Mr. Belson for many years.

516
00:35:18,364 --> 00:35:23,827
And then one member just said, well, what if we do this back to school drive?

517
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,188
And then it just got 16 of us.

518
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:28,129
Wow, that's a good thing.

519
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:29,550
Let's talk about it.

520
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:31,571
And the rest was history.

521
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:35,574
It was just a team of volunteers from the hospital,

522
00:35:36,497 --> 00:35:47,648
which we still have team effort that we do on multiple things, including what we do in Kiwanis, the chamber, Tufts Community Day, and the mayor's outing that we do.

523
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:51,632
And when we really thought about it,

524
00:35:53,053 --> 00:35:56,315
It just became natural for us.

525
00:35:56,735 --> 00:36:07,240
We look for that moment, that June email that I've already sort of put together to Beverly to say, all of the principals, what do they need?

526
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,142
Let us know, because we're gonna go and get what their needs are.

527
00:36:11,682 --> 00:36:20,426
And again, I wanna thank Staples, which is our major donor, and thanks Little Rocco, who has been the driving force trying to get

528
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:25,377
for us the amount that they donate.

529
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:32,221
But many other organizations and all the employees at Hallmark Health Lawrence Memorial contributed to this.

530
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:42,648
And before I introduce the members, I'm going to just introduce or really mention some of these groups, like the Medford Kiwanis, this year the Rotary Club.

531
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:46,334
the PTO, and then we have Armstrong.

532
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:59,524
We also have Genesis, our nursing home, and then many other folks that just came in and offered their checks, their cash, and we have gone and bought certain things to really make it happen.

533
00:36:59,944 --> 00:37:04,328
So my committee that's here is Lou Rocco, spent from day one.

534
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:10,934
We got from Armstrong, Chris Hill, representing Armstrong, which every year they make donations to our program.

535
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:14,718
And they have a box in their local place that they collect.

536
00:37:15,258 --> 00:37:22,265
This is my partner, Janet Perrault, she's always there with us trying to get this program going too.

537
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:23,306
for us.

538
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:28,531
Joe Ramos again has been over and over an outstanding gentleman.

539
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:34,716
He's in Italy as he usually is and he just again looks forward to this.

540
00:37:34,736 --> 00:37:43,103
So again, thank you so much for allowing us to do this and giving us this opportunity to give back to the students and make their school year a successful year.

541
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:43,663
Thank you.

542
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:57,035
Well, on behalf of all of the children of the city of Medford, we want to thank you for all the hard work you do, how you coordinate this and get so many backpacks in the hands of needy children.

543
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:00,697
We're astounded, and we're just so thankful to have you a part of our community.

544
00:38:00,717 --> 00:38:01,598
So thank you all.

545
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:13,385
Thanks for coming tonight.

546
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:16,365
Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

547
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,226
Motion to accept by Ms.

548
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:20,527
Cunha, seconded by Ms.

549
00:38:20,587 --> 00:38:20,927
Kritz.

550
00:38:21,287 --> 00:38:21,987
All those in favor?

551
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:22,527
Aye.

552
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:23,187
All those opposed?

553
00:38:23,227 --> 00:38:23,968
Motion passes.

554
00:38:26,128 --> 00:38:28,969
Report on a Giro backpack donation program.

555
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:32,730
So another important thing, and Diane is going to fill you in on a Giro.

556
00:38:34,082 --> 00:38:35,864
So is it proper to say, let them eat cake?

557
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:37,046
Yes.

558
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:49,079
In addition to our team Medford Patriots and whatever they do for us in Medford Public Schools, we also need to take this opportunity to thank Jero.

559
00:38:50,596 --> 00:39:12,042
specifically Mr. Sidney Wolfe, the founder of Agero and the cross-country group, David Farrick, who is CEO and President of Agero, Sandy Savage, Vice President of Human Resources, Sandy Reyes, Human Resources Business Partner, and all the local employees of Agero for their generous donation of backpacks and other school supplies.

560
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:18,684
So, like Beverly, when I get that phone call from Sandy Reyes at Agero saying, are you coming?

561
00:39:20,195 --> 00:39:31,038
I'm just there, Michelle and I, my administrative assistant and I go over to Ajero and we get 60 backpacks and they're filled with school supplies for the kids.

562
00:39:31,098 --> 00:39:39,021
There are pencils and pens and markers and notebooks all filled and even additional boxes that we have.

563
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:45,943
So they're not just for elementary, we try to parcel it out so we can give some of the backpacks to middle schools as well.

564
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:53,135
So together our principals decided that the backpacks should be disseminated to the most economically disadvantaged students.

565
00:39:53,795 --> 00:40:04,503
We've also saved a number of the backpacks to present to the Department of Social Services at our regular holiday donation drive, which I think most of you know we've been doing this for years now.

566
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:07,566
So we keep some of those backpacks back.

567
00:40:09,772 --> 00:40:17,576
And we are just so fortunate to have generous partners such as Agero who continue to make a real difference in the lives of our children in school.

568
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:28,661
So currently the backpacks are in my literacy office and we will be disseminating maybe six or 10 per school for the elementary and the middle schools.

569
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:35,845
And then obviously we'll give some supplies to our high school and our vocational schools, pencils and pens and whatever they need as well.

570
00:40:37,387 --> 00:40:43,898
Mr. Bull couldn't be here tonight, but he wanted to send his best and we just want to thank all our great business partners.

571
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:44,750
Ms.

572
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,290
Vander Kloot.

573
00:40:46,030 --> 00:41:02,753
I would like to make a motion that the school committee send a letter both to Team Medford and to Adgero and Mr. Wolf to thank them so that it could be posted someplace and express our appreciation for their incredible donations.

574
00:41:03,313 --> 00:41:03,913
That would be great.

575
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:04,713
Thank you very much.

576
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:06,574
On the motion, offered by Ms.

577
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:07,654
Vander Kloot, seconded by Ms.

578
00:41:07,694 --> 00:41:08,054
Cuno.

579
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:08,874
All those in favor?

580
00:41:08,894 --> 00:41:08,954
Aye.

581
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:10,274
All those opposed?

582
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:11,035
Motion passes.

583
00:41:11,675 --> 00:41:13,395
Mr. Superintendent, we'll get a letter out tomorrow?

584
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:15,289
Thank you, Ms.

585
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:15,790
Caldwell.

586
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,554
Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

587
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:19,115
So moved.

588
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:19,736
So moved.

589
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:20,818
All those in favor?

590
00:41:21,238 --> 00:41:21,499
Aye.

591
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,200
All those opposed?

592
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:23,442
Motion passes.

593
00:41:24,243 --> 00:41:26,046
Report on meeting with Wegmans.

594
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:26,587
Ms.

595
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:27,068
Nelson.

596
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,948
Okay, from one store to the other.

597
00:41:31,968 --> 00:41:33,688
A market basket to Wegmans.

598
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:47,534
On Tuesday, August 15th, Wegmans hosted an informational meeting for several non-profits, community school, and city leaders at their offices at Station Landing in Medford.

599
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:54,317
I was able to attend, along with Diane Caldwell, Chad Fallon, Jill Sawyer, and Lisa Evangelista.

600
00:41:54,897 --> 00:41:57,078
We all represented the school district at the meeting.

601
00:41:58,038 --> 00:42:06,330
And the purpose of the meeting is that the staff of Wegmans really wanted to learn more about what they could do for the community and for the schools.

602
00:42:07,272 --> 00:42:08,453
They have a lot to offer.

603
00:42:10,352 --> 00:42:11,272
are still hiring.

604
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:15,894
There was an article actually in the transcript that spoke to this meeting and what they're doing.

605
00:42:16,874 --> 00:42:24,037
They're marking their 100th anniversary, and they actually have been named one of the best places to work in the United States.

606
00:42:25,078 --> 00:42:38,823
We were welcomed by the store manager, Kevin Russell, the store manager, the Medford service manager, Paula Colnane, and Mary Ellen Burris, who is the Senior Vice President of Consumer Affairs.

607
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:47,531
All three have had long-standing roles in the company and could not speak more highly about what the company has done for their careers and communities.

608
00:42:48,071 --> 00:42:53,596
Wegmans offers scholarships, and some of the people there actually started as clerks.

609
00:42:53,717 --> 00:43:01,664
They started in Wegmans in different parts of the country, and they were given scholarships, and they continued their undergraduate and graduate studies.

610
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,745
So they're very generous.

611
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,549
We could not be more warmly welcomed by them.

612
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:14,318
Not only did they have a lovely breakfast for us, they again wanted to know what we could do, what they could do for us moving forward.

613
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:22,026
And again, we're hoping that some of our students will apply for some of the part-time jobs because it can lead to scholarship opportunities for them.

614
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:27,911
They also gave us a lovely goody bag, which contained breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next couple of days.

615
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:30,532
Their products are really lovely.

616
00:43:30,873 --> 00:43:32,094
They have all the ingredients.

617
00:43:32,114 --> 00:43:36,877
They're very concerned about food allergies, things that we're concerned about in the schools as well.

618
00:43:37,377 --> 00:43:38,818
So we welcome them to Medford.

619
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:44,342
They couldn't speak more highly of things that they wanted to do for us, and we will coordinate

620
00:43:44,782 --> 00:43:56,489
Probably through Lisa and the school so that not everybody's kind of at the same time asking for things all during the school year They're officially open November 5th Okay, all right make sure you're included

621
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:12,899
That's fine.

622
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,366
My real point is, are we going to set up a co-op with our vocational students with Wegmans?

623
00:44:18,446 --> 00:44:26,255
Because I don't know if they meal prep right there, but a lot of our culinary students could get a lot of expertise and knowledge.

624
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:32,102
So the sooner we could maybe start that conversation, the better.

625
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:34,669
Well, Chad and Jill were there at the meeting.

626
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:43,162
We did inform them about the new restaurant that's opening at the school, so I'm sure they will further those discussions, because they were present.

627
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:46,904
And they will also have a restaurant on site as well, within the Wegmans.

628
00:44:47,344 --> 00:44:51,647
Right, that's why I thought it was a good opportunity for a co-op.

629
00:44:51,967 --> 00:45:00,234
So maybe when we do our grand opening at our restaurant, we can make sure that Wegmans is sitting at the first table.

630
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:04,557
We mentioned that to them, that we would invite them, Chad mentioned that, that they would be invited to that too.

631
00:45:04,962 --> 00:45:06,263
Great, thank you so much.

632
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:06,823
Thank you.

633
00:45:07,924 --> 00:45:09,945
On the motion of this report be placed on file.

634
00:45:10,005 --> 00:45:11,846
Moved by Mr. Bannon, seconded by Ms.

635
00:45:11,866 --> 00:45:12,306
Vander Ploet.

636
00:45:12,346 --> 00:45:13,006
All those in favor?

637
00:45:13,026 --> 00:45:13,587
Aye.

638
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:14,567
All those opposed?

639
00:45:14,987 --> 00:45:15,768
Motion passes.

640
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:20,808
Report on stop and shop donation to the member public schools.

641
00:45:20,828 --> 00:45:24,229
So Stop and shop is still working out the details.

642
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:33,691
So tonight we'll put it aside and wait on the table, but I can assure you that There's gonna be a lot of competition between supermarkets and Mr. Scary all those in favor.

643
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,992
I was opposed papers tabled.

644
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:35,032
I

645
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:50,047
Update report on public release of MCAS 2.0 information and accountability ratings.

646
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:57,074
I'm going to call upon our Director of Curriculum, Bernadette Riccidelli, to keep you informed of how MCAS is progressing out of the DESE.

647
00:45:58,755 --> 00:45:59,296
Good evening.

648
00:46:00,588 --> 00:46:08,213
So I am here to report tonight on the scheduled releases of our assessment results for MCAS.

649
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:19,801
So the next generation MCAS in grades three through eight, and the legacy MCAS, which is the old traditional MCAS at the high school, and also the accountability ratings.

650
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:23,143
So I've written a lot in the report.

651
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:27,546
I've taken the schedule directly from the Department of Ed site, so you have all of the dates.

652
00:46:28,346 --> 00:46:31,010
I've highlighted the major dates in the report.

653
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:35,936
So as you can see, as early as June, we were receiving some raw data.

654
00:46:37,057 --> 00:46:44,107
For the purpose of this report, I started in August where we started seeing some of the preliminary data in raw format.

655
00:46:45,207 --> 00:46:48,088
both the assessment as well as the accountability.

656
00:46:48,968 --> 00:46:54,130
So just jumping forward because everyone is waiting for the official results to come out.

657
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,131
So we need to wait until mid-October this year.

658
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:59,892
It seems like each year it's getting a little bit later.

659
00:47:01,012 --> 00:47:12,195
So October 24th is the date in which the official district and school level MCAS and the MCAS alt results are released to the public.

660
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:16,517
The official accountability reports for all districts and schools will be released to the public.

661
00:47:17,357 --> 00:47:23,101
And also the printed MCAS parent guardian reports will be received by the superintendent's office.

662
00:47:23,121 --> 00:47:24,723
So October 24th is that date.

663
00:47:25,163 --> 00:47:32,889
Now they do say that is an estimate, so we're planning right around that date for the results to be released.

664
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,333
So certainly we will be preparing reports for you.

665
00:47:38,714 --> 00:47:43,779
So that as soon as possible, once they're un-embargoed, we can report those to you.

666
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:55,892
As far as the accountability schedule, reporting schedule is concerned, if we go back to November of 2015, the Board of Education amended the accountability system that we had in place.

667
00:47:56,973 --> 00:48:10,626
And this was done so that districts and schools administering the next generation MCAS assessment in grades three through eight this past spring would not have their accountability results negatively impacted based on those scores.

668
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:28,758
This regulation allows the Department of Education to limit the use of levels 1 through 3 this fall for any school that enrolls students in grades 3 through 8 as long as the school has a participation rate of at least 90% in the administration of this past spring's MCAS.

669
00:48:29,258 --> 00:48:30,859
So participation rate is key.

670
00:48:39,244 --> 00:48:40,165
That's important to know.

671
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:43,388
So again, not so much the assessment results, but participation.

672
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:57,720
The Department of Ed will publish next generation MCAS results for each school and district, including a normative measure of achievement to help districts and the Department of Ed identify schools that may require support.

673
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:13,280
The Department of Ed will report the participation rate separately for English language arts, mathematics, and science, and for each district and school as a whole, as well as for each subgroup.

674
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,962
So again, they're looking for a 90% participation rate.

675
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:27,429
Schools that assess at least 90% of their students in all groups and subjects will not be assigned an accountability and assistance level of one to three, one, two, or three.

676
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:36,032
Any school or district with participation rates below 90% for any group of students in any subject will be placed into level three.

677
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:46,560
As far as high school level testing is concerned, so we're talking about the legacy MCAS test, the assessment and accountability results will be reported.

678
00:49:47,400 --> 00:50:00,951
High schools will continue to receive an accountability and assistance level based on their PPI and the school percentile data with adjustments for those schools with persistently low graduation rates or very low assessment participation.

679
00:50:01,311 --> 00:50:05,775
So again, for the high school level, we're looking at participation and low graduation rates.

680
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:13,742
So as we move forward with this, a new accountability system is in the process of being developed.

681
00:50:14,623 --> 00:50:20,708
So this fall, the Board of Education will be considering those changes.

682
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:27,254
And the changes do need to be consistent with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA.

683
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:31,825
So that in a nutshell is the reporting schedule.

684
00:50:31,845 --> 00:50:36,427
So again, October 24th is the date that we should have the official results.

685
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:37,687
I'm happy to take any questions.

686
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:38,028
Ms.

687
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:38,588
Van de Kloot.

688
00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:40,209
I have two questions.

689
00:50:40,229 --> 00:50:52,515
The first question is, I remember that last year there was the need for a lot of people to be concerned because some of the things that were reported out needed to be corrected.

690
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:54,936
There were lots of discrepancies.

691
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:56,977
And I know that's a very timely thing.

692
00:50:57,317 --> 00:51:09,230
Yes, was the information that you received so far this year more accurate It appeared so There were a few things that we we caught on the discrepancy report.

693
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,973
So those have been addressed we were

694
00:51:15,236 --> 00:51:25,298
We did not want a repeat of last year, which everything turned out fine, but we believe we caught the few discrepancies.

695
00:51:25,338 --> 00:51:28,739
But I know you had to do a lot of footwork last year.

696
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,980
Yes.

697
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,261
We did.

698
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:34,423
The second question has to do with the participation rates.

699
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:38,687
Are we anticipating that our participation rates were solid?

700
00:51:39,327 --> 00:51:43,030
The initial look at it suggests that we are there.

701
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:44,692
I mean, we should have some idea, shouldn't we?

702
00:51:45,332 --> 00:51:45,853
We should.

703
00:51:45,873 --> 00:51:51,717
I just do need to be careful because they're embargoed.

704
00:51:51,898 --> 00:51:53,599
They look to be fine.

705
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:54,580
We're not concerned about that.

706
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,662
I mean, but we know who took the test and who didn't.

707
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:56,922
Yes.

708
00:51:57,422 --> 00:51:58,103
Okay.

709
00:51:58,543 --> 00:52:01,988
So in the preliminary results, we actually get a percentage.

710
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,190
So we looked at that.

711
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,051
Okay.

712
00:52:04,752 --> 00:52:05,073
Thank you.

713
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:06,194
You're welcome.

714
00:52:06,214 --> 00:52:06,675
Mr. Benedetto.

715
00:52:07,576 --> 00:52:10,501
My first thing is more of a statement than a question.

716
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:14,747
It seems that the DESE is

717
00:52:15,685 --> 00:52:40,799
punishing school districts that have low participation rates so that they have forcing everybody to take this test at this time whether Whether they don't like it or not So I think that's a comment that's clear to me is that it's being pushed and if you do participate you get less punished as far as your rating or you get more time for your rating to

718
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:44,304
to be accountable.

719
00:52:44,685 --> 00:52:45,986
Can I just clarify?

720
00:52:46,267 --> 00:52:52,293
The participation rate results refers to the number of students taking the test.

721
00:52:52,313 --> 00:52:56,518
So like when parents decided that they opt out?

722
00:52:56,578 --> 00:52:56,798
Yes.

723
00:52:57,038 --> 00:53:03,706
So they're holding the district's hands at, you know, pushing parents to opt in.

724
00:53:04,242 --> 00:53:08,667
for this because districts are gonna really push for every child to take it.

725
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:17,217
And I knew that we had an issue last year with the subgroup with participation rate because of absences or other issues.

726
00:53:17,784 --> 00:53:26,346
And so I'm sure we were very careful ourselves to make sure that our participation rate was appropriate when we were taking the test.

727
00:53:26,566 --> 00:53:28,327
So those are just some comments.

728
00:53:28,347 --> 00:53:42,431
So I know parents were really pushing against it and didn't want their children to take this test, but it's very important to the district that it does, and the district does get punished from DESE if not, or held at a higher accountability than districts.

729
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:44,512
that parents don't opt out.

730
00:53:45,313 --> 00:53:47,855
So that's just a comment from what I've seen.

731
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:57,382
Secondly, I wanted to know, so the BN keeps us from going over any preliminary results that the district gets?

732
00:53:57,622 --> 00:54:08,751
As a committee, we can't notify, because we are... Well, it's a public meeting, so we cannot release the results to... But if we went into an executive session, can we be updated?

733
00:54:09,938 --> 00:54:10,939
It's embargoed?

734
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,381
You've got to ask the question.

735
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:14,022
Yeah, it's embargoed.

736
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:21,269
Part of the reason is because of discrepancy reports and other things like that, they want to make sure everything is right before it goes out there.

737
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:30,237
Now, you may have noticed in the Globe today, if you've read the Globe at all, that there were some comments about 26 Boston schools were underperforming.

738
00:54:30,858 --> 00:54:35,002
Somebody leaked something out there, and I'm sure there's going to be some comment out there.

739
00:54:36,223 --> 00:54:40,510
It's very hard to know exactly how they're going to finally come down on things.

740
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:46,881
But we know one thing is if your participation rate is good, there's no accountability rating this year outside of the high school.

741
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:49,757
So that's my other comment.

742
00:54:50,077 --> 00:54:59,243
So them waiving accountability doesn't mean that we're not accountable as a district to make sure that our children were ready last year and that they're ready in the future.

743
00:54:59,303 --> 00:55:05,868
So I don't like when they dangle that carrot in front of your face and say, oh, well, it doesn't count this year, so don't worry.

744
00:55:06,248 --> 00:55:08,970
It still counts to every parent and every child who took the test.

745
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:18,153
So if I can just answer that a little bit, I think the thing that you've got to remember, this is the first full year that MCAS 2.0 was out there.

746
00:55:18,574 --> 00:55:26,777
So as a result, as a new test, it really, in order to be fair to people, they had to see the kinds of questions, they had to see what it was about, whether it really

747
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:32,120
the questions were proper and the like, and they have to do that analysis with their own testing company.

748
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,203
So rather than, it's like a new product, it's really in a pilot phase.

749
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:39,986
So the second year, they're saying, okay, you had a year to try it out.

750
00:55:40,306 --> 00:55:41,647
We've had a year to work out the bugs.

751
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:43,809
Now we'll start to look at it for real.

752
00:55:44,249 --> 00:55:45,250
So that's really part of it.

753
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:49,453
It isn't really an attempt to hide anything, because I think some people in the state would love to.

754
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,295
issue accountability ratings.

755
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:56,982
But having said that, I think part of it is because you can't just do that with new stuff.

756
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:57,844
You have to look at it.

757
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:03,487
We as a community are not accountable for that.

758
00:56:03,788 --> 00:56:08,552
We are still accountable for teaching our children how to take this test and how to do well on it.

759
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:21,984
And I don't want parents to think, oh, because it's not accountable by DESC that we aren't accountable as a committee and as an educational entity that to our students and to

760
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:24,805
to have them do very well.

761
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,446
I just wanted to put that out there.

762
00:56:26,746 --> 00:56:28,948
I don't like it when they say it doesn't count.

763
00:56:29,228 --> 00:56:31,909
Because it counts, because the kids took the time to take the exam.

764
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:39,774
And you guys, as a school district, we spent a lot of time and a lot of money making sure that we do this well and do it right.

765
00:56:39,974 --> 00:56:42,355
So it counts.

766
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:45,297
And it's the data.

767
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:50,675
We'll use that data to set up for next year, so it does count to us in so many ways.

768
00:56:51,155 --> 00:56:55,096
So that's just another comment, nothing directed at anybody here.

769
00:56:56,696 --> 00:57:07,760
So to my colleague who's the committee chair of the academic committee, last year there was a meeting to go over the results because it's very involved.

770
00:57:08,886 --> 00:57:13,090
So, as a... Yes, but we haven't gotten any results yet.

771
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:18,695
But we could schedule the meeting, and then, so we know the results are coming in 24 hours.

772
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:19,195
We always do.

773
00:57:20,577 --> 00:57:21,598
Let's just look at schedules.

774
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:23,179
I mean, there's a lot of things we want to talk about.

775
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,861
Tonight was a good example.

776
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,322
But we'll get a meeting.

777
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:29,405
It's not something, you know, we obviously have those meetings.

778
00:57:29,425 --> 00:57:31,247
Traditionally, it goes to the curriculum committee.

779
00:57:32,173 --> 00:57:32,333
Ms.

780
00:57:32,373 --> 00:57:34,875
Mustone, were you going to say something, Mr. Belson?

781
00:57:35,116 --> 00:57:36,177
I just want to say one thing.

782
00:57:36,357 --> 00:57:47,386
I've been talking to Senator Jalen, who's about to file a bill in the legislature, in the Senate, looking to modify the accountability system in a substantial way.

783
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:57,935
Where it goes, how it goes, but you can clearly tell that the debate is very strong these days about academic proficiency not being the only way you measure a school.

784
00:57:58,856 --> 00:58:10,770
And two polls were out, the Gallup poll and the Phi Delta Kappan poll, both of which sampled parents across the country, all of whom were saying there's more to school than testing.

785
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:13,313
And the pushback is becoming very, very strong.

786
00:58:14,236 --> 00:58:18,858
The Massachusetts Board of Education tends to be very protesting.

787
00:58:19,418 --> 00:58:20,938
So we'll have to see where that plays out.

788
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:31,402
But there's an awful lot of ferment out there right now about the implications of just simply evaluating schools only on test results.

789
00:58:32,096 --> 00:58:36,057
So I've seen portions of Senator Jalen's bill.

790
00:58:36,577 --> 00:58:45,679
I'll introduce it to you at some point in the near future when she's ready to release it, because I think there's a lot of good material in there looking at how to look at schools in a more comprehensive way.

791
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,960
We talk about social and emotional learning.

792
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,260
We talk about career and technical education.

793
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,380
We talk about health.

794
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,381
All those things are important in a school.

795
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:56,381
We're developing youth that have transitioned to adulthood.

796
00:58:56,722 --> 00:58:58,222
We're not just developing test takers.

797
00:58:58,822 --> 00:59:11,608
So a good school in a community like in Boston where you've got 26 schools that someone decided was underperforming, there's a lot of things that go on in some of those demographies out there that are far more complex than just simply a test score.

798
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:17,810
So how we look at our young people, how we look at schools and what we do needs more scrutiny.

799
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:23,693
And I think Senator Jalen and others are starting to raise that question in a very, very powerful way in the state.

800
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:24,802
Ms.

801
00:59:24,842 --> 00:59:27,763
Mostow, you had mentioned discrepancy.

802
00:59:27,823 --> 00:59:30,904
Is that part of the embargoed information, or could you elaborate?

803
00:59:30,924 --> 00:59:31,444
Yes, it is.

804
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:34,185
So in October, we will know what the discrepancies were?

805
00:59:34,585 --> 00:59:39,106
No, so there's a discrepancy reporting window, which was in August.

806
00:59:39,486 --> 00:59:46,548
So that's when the administrators, the principals, the curriculum directors take a look at, we take an initial look at the data.

807
00:59:46,908 --> 00:59:48,289
We look at the students who took the test.

808
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:55,512
to see if there's anybody missing, if the numbers are correct in terms of who was supposed to be participating.

809
00:59:56,092 --> 01:00:06,978
So we have, I don't know, it's about 10 days or so a week in which we then can report to the state that there was a discrepancy in what they have on paper and what we have as far as our students.

810
01:00:07,678 --> 01:00:12,262
So that is not, that's not reported out in any official results.

811
01:00:12,282 --> 01:00:16,065
Were there many discrepancies between what the state presented to you and what you had?

812
01:00:16,185 --> 01:00:17,506
I don't know the exact number.

813
01:00:17,526 --> 01:00:19,548
I think that it was minimal.

814
01:00:20,649 --> 01:00:21,890
There were more last year.

815
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:30,617
It was not, the initial look at the data would suggest that it was pretty accurate.

816
01:00:30,637 --> 01:00:34,640
So let me give you an example of something that was an interesting one last year.

817
01:00:35,421 --> 01:00:36,402
Fascinating kind of thing.

818
01:00:37,132 --> 01:00:48,416
A student who came to this country, booked a test, but didn't take the English language arts test because it was his first year in the country.

819
01:00:49,037 --> 01:00:52,458
However, because he had a SASID number when he was in the first grade,

820
01:00:53,413 --> 01:00:55,654
OK, he had been in the country for a short period of time.

821
01:00:56,035 --> 01:00:59,137
The state decided that he was, in fact, not a first year student.

822
01:00:59,837 --> 01:01:01,718
We had to petition and clean that out.

823
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:07,062
Now, how would we know, coming from another district someplace else, that this wasn't his first year?

824
01:01:07,982 --> 01:01:09,623
That's an example of a discrepancy.

825
01:01:10,184 --> 01:01:19,550
Medicals, people that are out on a medical who somehow don't get coded out of the thing, all of a sudden you have to go back and say, well, this kid's been in the hospital for the last six months.

826
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:21,410
I mean, how can you count them?

827
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:24,612
They couldn't possibly take the test in the setting they were in.

828
01:01:25,332 --> 01:01:27,113
So those are some of the things that happen.

829
01:01:27,693 --> 01:01:35,196
And you have to pay attention to those, because otherwise, you have 100 kids and five or six kids don't take the test for various reasons.

830
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:37,717
All of a sudden, you're below a certain threshold.

831
01:01:38,757 --> 01:01:40,078
And that's not what you're going to pay attention to.

832
01:01:40,098 --> 01:01:43,859
And with subgroups, it's even less, because the subgroups are even smaller numbers.

833
01:01:44,459 --> 01:01:48,881
So if you have 25 kids, one kid could be four percentage points.

834
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:50,765
Thank you.

835
01:01:52,327 --> 01:01:54,550
Motion to accept and place on file.

836
01:01:54,991 --> 01:01:56,433
And thank you, Bernadette.

837
01:01:56,453 --> 01:01:58,295
That's a motion to accept and place on file.

838
01:01:58,375 --> 01:01:59,036
Seconded by Ms.

839
01:01:59,076 --> 01:01:59,317
Cunha.

840
01:01:59,457 --> 01:02:00,258
All those in favor?

841
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:00,758
Aye.

842
01:02:00,979 --> 01:02:01,800
All those opposed?

843
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:02,821
Motion passed.

844
01:02:04,043 --> 01:02:05,885
Report on summer programs.

845
01:02:06,746 --> 01:02:08,108
Dave Beverly's going to do this.

846
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:11,392
I have Anthony with me tonight.

847
01:02:12,493 --> 01:02:16,496
As all of you know, we run a full complement of summer programs.

848
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:19,738
Some of them are voluntary for students.

849
01:02:20,538 --> 01:02:28,244
Some of them are mandatory, like regular summer school for making up courses during the school year that a youngster may have failed.

850
01:02:28,724 --> 01:02:31,686
Some of them have a cost to them, and some are free of charge.

851
01:02:32,387 --> 01:02:35,389
We have, again, a lot of things going on all summer long.

852
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:43,336
I asked people who ran programs to come tonight to present to you themselves, and Anthony volunteered to come.

853
01:02:43,697 --> 01:02:47,040
So we'll start with the Summer Fund Program, and Anthony, you wanna tell us a little bit about that?

854
01:02:56,736 --> 01:02:57,657
Hi, thank you for having me.

855
01:02:57,897 --> 01:02:58,838
I'm Anthony Pachelis.

856
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:01,621
I'm the director of the Mefford Summer Fund Program.

857
01:03:01,681 --> 01:03:04,744
It's in its 11th year of existence and my 10th year running it.

858
01:03:05,185 --> 01:03:08,728
I'm just going to give you a short, you know, little description about the camp.

859
01:03:08,749 --> 01:03:11,031
But as I said, this is our 11th year of running it.

860
01:03:11,912 --> 01:03:13,153
We run out of Mefford High School.

861
01:03:13,594 --> 01:03:14,815
We average about 130 to 140 kids a week.

862
01:03:17,397 --> 01:03:21,619
At some weeks we were able to hit up into the 160s, one high 150s, low 160s.

863
01:03:22,359 --> 01:03:24,240
We provide breakfast every morning for the children.

864
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,921
Every Friday we provide them free pizza for lunch.

865
01:03:27,701 --> 01:03:36,504
And throughout the week we have different activities that come to camp, whether it's a magician, a carnival, and so on that we provide for the kids each week that they're registered.

866
01:03:36,844 --> 01:03:38,845
We also hold the World Cup Soccer Tournament.

867
01:03:39,205 --> 01:03:40,545
We hold the Dodgeball Tournament.

868
01:03:41,186 --> 01:03:43,407
And this year we were able to partner up with

869
01:03:44,907 --> 01:03:45,668
miss miss stone.

870
01:03:46,729 --> 01:03:55,917
And we were able with the greater Boston food bank, the mayor and hallmark held to get food donated every Friday to camp for family.

871
01:03:55,937 --> 01:04:04,064
So on the way that the families were picking up their kids, we were able to have bags of food provided for families for dinner for that night or over the weekend.

872
01:04:04,864 --> 01:04:14,509
Over the four weeks we did it, we did it four Fridays, July 28th, August 4th, August 11th, and August 18th, we were able to give away over 250 bags.

873
01:04:15,229 --> 01:04:21,352
And that was great, a lot of parents were very pleased and very happy that we were able to provide a service like that for them.

874
01:04:22,633 --> 01:04:24,555
As I said, I just wanted to come and talk about the camp.

875
01:04:24,595 --> 01:04:32,182
I think it's one of those great programs that we have in the city that a lot of people are starting to hear about and know about, and every single year we've grown in size.

876
01:04:32,742 --> 01:04:37,547
We have over 30 employees, 33 employees, part-time and full-time.

877
01:04:37,967 --> 01:04:47,696
and all of them are City of Mefford kids that went through the elementary schools and middle schools and high schools, and some are currently in high school or graduated from Mefford High or in college.

878
01:04:48,157 --> 01:04:54,643
So we provide a great service for the youth of the community from elementary all the way up to high school and beyond.

879
01:04:56,648 --> 01:05:00,950
That next year, Wegmans will help you with the food stuff.

880
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:02,211
Yeah, when I heard that, yeah.

881
01:05:02,251 --> 01:05:03,751
Definitely, absolutely, yeah.

882
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:04,172
Mayor Burke.

883
01:05:04,232 --> 01:05:09,254
If I could just jump in on the food portion of it, and really, we have to thank Mia in a large way.

884
01:05:09,314 --> 01:05:11,895
Not mean Mia, Mia.

885
01:05:12,035 --> 01:05:17,918
She really, we've had several meetings on food insecurity at City Hall, and Mia has been a part of all of those conversations.

886
01:05:18,558 --> 01:05:24,161
And she was with her van, we went in and picked up the whole truckload of stuff in her van one Friday.

887
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:29,127
And it continued for four weeks, so we want to really thank you, Mia, for all of your hard work.

888
01:05:29,247 --> 01:05:30,248
And Sarah.

889
01:05:30,388 --> 01:05:36,456
And Anthony for coordinating it once everything came back to you, because that was, I know, a lot of effort on your part as well.

890
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:39,240
So thank you all for doing what you can for our kids.

891
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,241
Mayor Burke.

892
01:05:41,481 --> 01:05:43,201
I think that's such a great addition.

893
01:05:43,341 --> 01:05:51,704
I also though just need to take a moment to thank my colleague Ann Marie Cuno who was a driving force of setting up the camp 11 years ago.

894
01:05:53,204 --> 01:05:56,125
It's been a long time of great successes.

895
01:05:56,425 --> 01:05:59,807
It was one of my biggest, it was one of my things on my to-do list.

896
01:06:01,531 --> 01:06:03,913
As a co-founder of the program, I'm very proud of the program.

897
01:06:04,414 --> 01:06:09,018
And like anything else, I always say that we have to have the foundation done the right way when we start something off.

898
01:06:09,578 --> 01:06:13,262
So it has proved itself many times.

899
01:06:13,702 --> 01:06:15,204
So I'm very proud of that program.

900
01:06:15,784 --> 01:06:16,044
Thank you.

901
01:06:16,165 --> 01:06:17,466
And you do a great job, Anthony.

902
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:17,986
Thank you.

903
01:06:18,006 --> 01:06:18,206
Yes.

904
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:18,567
Thank you.

905
01:06:18,827 --> 01:06:19,267
Thank you.

906
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:20,448
Thank you guys.

907
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:20,909
Thank you.

908
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:29,932
It's amazing so many programs are going on simultaneously at the high school and they kind of all share the pool and the facilities and it seems to come together.

909
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,073
I really don't have a lot of problems.

910
01:06:32,473 --> 01:06:35,714
People take care of their own business and Anthony's been wonderful with that program.

911
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:40,576
Other programs, we always have our special education program.

912
01:06:40,636 --> 01:06:43,557
Lisa Ionelli was overseeing it this year.

913
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:47,058
Again, this program is basically for students who

914
01:06:47,818 --> 01:06:58,045
have in their IEPs, extended year services, and again, they were approximately 145 students that participated in those programs this summer.

915
01:06:58,925 --> 01:07:01,347
We have our English learner program.

916
01:07:01,587 --> 01:07:06,190
Paul Texera, our new director, supervised that program.

917
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:10,993
Approximately 75 English learner students through grades one through 12.

918
01:07:12,038 --> 01:07:16,159
attended, they were at the McGlynn Elementary and the McGlynn Middle School.

919
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:28,042
We try to contain our programs in as few schools as possible so we get all the cleaning done and we tell John McLaughlin the schedule so he can work around it so it all seems to come together.

920
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:39,165
High School 101, this is a program that we started years ago when we had the academic support grant to support students who have difficulty passing MCAS.

921
01:07:41,005 --> 01:07:45,869
Dr. Kieser and David Blow were overseeing this organizing the program.

922
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:52,775
It's basically a program for students who are coming into grade nine and it kind of gives them a jump start.

923
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:56,579
All eighth grade students have math work to do over the summer.

924
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:26,160
and they have reading to do over the summer, so we bring the students in about three or four days in August, and the teachers are there to help them to finish the assignments, because oftentimes these are the students that will go into the classes, and the regular teacher in grade nine will say, where's your summer reading, or where's your summer math, and they don't have it, so this makes sure that they have those assignments completed, and we also interface it with just getting used to the high school, so during the time they're here, they get to meet the,

925
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:29,243
the principal, the assistant principal of the high school.

926
01:08:29,863 --> 01:08:33,987
And their last day actually is the regular freshman orientation day.

927
01:08:34,288 --> 01:08:35,789
So they're on board for that as well.

928
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:37,972
That program was very popular.

929
01:08:38,372 --> 01:08:43,217
Once the grant no longer existed, we thanked the committee for supporting it in regular budget.

930
01:08:43,617 --> 01:08:46,100
Parents love it and it really does help those youngsters.

931
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,824
They benefit a great deal coming in to school in the fall.

932
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,063
Mr. Tringali, our student representative would like to comment on that.

933
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:04,986
I just have a very fond memory of facilitating student orientation.

934
01:09:05,506 --> 01:09:13,370
And there was a group of people, a group of freshmen, who really knew their way around.

935
01:09:14,131 --> 01:09:18,893
And then there was a group of people who were asking, what's C building, what's B building?

936
01:09:20,294 --> 01:09:23,976
And the people who really knew their stuff were the high school 101 kids.

937
01:09:26,197 --> 01:09:31,502
Yeah, I think it's, I think, you know, if I had that, if I did that as a freshman, I would have been a lot less lost.

938
01:09:34,145 --> 01:09:34,946
And so I think it's great.

939
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:35,346
Thank you.

940
01:09:35,767 --> 01:09:36,027
Great.

941
01:09:36,067 --> 01:09:37,148
Thank you for that comment.

942
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:42,193
Other programs, we had our regular summer school.

943
01:09:43,855 --> 01:09:46,456
David Blau and Jill Sawyer were running that.

944
01:09:47,357 --> 01:09:51,600
And again, this program is for students who really have to make up a subject.

945
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:56,363
Now, one of the big pluses this year is we did not have a lot of seniors.

946
01:09:56,983 --> 01:10:01,046
Many times, seniors who fail a subject, they can't graduate.

947
01:10:01,586 --> 01:10:06,589
We actually, this spring, through credit recovery, got those seniors over the hump so that they

948
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:13,953
did not miss out on graduation, that they actually get into our graduation rate, which is a plus thing with our data.

949
01:10:14,613 --> 01:10:18,714
And also, we didn't have to have them pay for summer school.

950
01:10:19,795 --> 01:10:21,395
As in the past, we've had a lot of seniors.

951
01:10:21,976 --> 01:10:26,577
We also used our Plato, our online courses a great deal.

952
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:30,759
What we do is we have the curriculum directors look at the Plato.

953
01:10:30,779 --> 01:10:33,000
We don't throw students into online courses.

954
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,161
because some of them are better than others.

955
01:10:35,621 --> 01:10:40,262
We make sure that the curriculum people are comfortable with the content of the course.

956
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:47,625
And there were some courses, math courses, that perhaps really had to be delivered with the real teachers standing up in front of the class.

957
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:52,006
But most of the science classes, I believe all the science classes, were done online.

958
01:10:52,326 --> 01:10:53,747
This is the second year we did that.

959
01:10:54,327 --> 01:11:07,933
And again, it also, the other benefit of online courses is that when summer school officially ended on whatever day that was in August, some students who still needed a little bit more time were allowed to have it, because they could just continue online.

960
01:11:08,433 --> 01:11:19,098
And that was a real plus, and also students could take more than two courses, because traditional summer school, you basically have an eight to 10, and a 10 to 12, so you can only take two things,

961
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:25,623
online a student on his or her own could take a third course so we see a lot of potential.

962
01:11:25,663 --> 01:11:26,624
We hope to grow it.

963
01:11:27,144 --> 01:11:35,712
What we need to do is to take the packaged programs and make sure that we expand them with our own materials so that the curriculum directors

964
01:11:36,232 --> 01:11:41,736
feel that they're rigorous enough that they match the curriculum that would be, you know, a live course.

965
01:11:42,316 --> 01:11:45,198
So again, we had a great success with students doing well.

966
01:11:45,478 --> 01:11:51,522
We also, we learn, you know, after we do our summer programs, we sit down, we just don't close the books and say, okay, that's it.

967
01:11:52,322 --> 01:11:53,543
started again in June.

968
01:11:54,003 --> 01:11:56,345
We basically brainstormed what we can do better.

969
01:11:56,906 --> 01:12:03,570
And last year, we realized that the middle school students in summer school really were having a difficult time with the attention span.

970
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,312
They needed a different type of structure.

971
01:12:05,732 --> 01:12:12,117
So what we did this year, through the efforts of Jill and David, is we kind of mixed it up for the middle school youngsters.

972
01:12:12,157 --> 01:12:17,661
Yes, they did their math course, or they did their English course, but they also had a 45-minute block in between.

973
01:12:17,681 --> 01:12:20,443
And Bernadette Riccardelli was part of the planning team on this.

974
01:12:21,143 --> 01:12:28,390
where every week they did something different, whether it was an outdoor activity or learning some social emotional activities.

975
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:35,276
Again, it seemed to make them more liable to go back into the classroom and be much more focused.

976
01:12:35,316 --> 01:12:36,897
So we liked that addition.

977
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:37,878
I think it worked well.

978
01:12:38,419 --> 01:12:40,440
And again, we'll probably continue with that model.

979
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:44,664
It was just for sixth and seventh graders because those were the youngsters that were having difficulty.

980
01:12:44,684 --> 01:12:47,507
The eighth graders seemed to be okay with the traditional model.

981
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:53,841
Two other camps from basically middle school youngsters.

982
01:12:54,362 --> 01:12:57,324
Jill Sawyer ran the CTE Explore Camp.

983
01:12:57,804 --> 01:13:04,629
These are for middle school students who want to come into the vocational school, explore some of the offerings.

984
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:12,754
Actually, they had a great chance to see some of the different shops, auto tech, biotechnical, carpentry, and so on.

985
01:13:14,915 --> 01:13:21,139
The students actually had, I believe, a swim, an hour swim in the pool, and that was well attended as well.

986
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:23,441
Very short program, but again, worthwhile.

987
01:13:24,081 --> 01:13:28,704
And then finally, we have with Molly Leighton, our Director of Instructional Technology.

988
01:13:29,525 --> 01:13:32,487
She has her mobile app making summer camp.

989
01:13:32,982 --> 01:13:37,965
that she held again at the McGlynn from July 17th to the 21st.

990
01:13:38,385 --> 01:13:43,988
And again, this is tied to a funded program through the National Science Foundation project.

991
01:13:44,769 --> 01:13:46,030
So any questions?

992
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:50,252
I think everything went very well and it's positive feedback.

993
01:13:51,573 --> 01:13:53,274
Just a comment on the science camp.

994
01:13:53,294 --> 01:13:54,995
I know the kids absolutely love it.

995
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:59,358
It's a real hit and kids get a lot out of it and a big jump for the next year.

996
01:13:59,498 --> 01:13:59,698
Great.

997
01:14:00,339 --> 01:14:01,820
Thank you for all the summer programming.

998
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,860
Are there any questions?

999
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:03,800
No?

1000
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,281
Motion that this report be placed on file, authored by Ms.

1001
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:07,341
Cunha, seconded by Ms.

1002
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:07,922
Vander Kloof.

1003
01:14:08,242 --> 01:14:09,002
All those in favor?

1004
01:14:09,022 --> 01:14:09,802
Aye.

1005
01:14:09,882 --> 01:14:10,583
All those opposed?

1006
01:14:12,023 --> 01:14:12,423
Papers?

1007
01:14:13,023 --> 01:14:13,424
Passes.

1008
01:14:14,524 --> 01:14:17,145
Report on McGlynn Middle School action plan.

1009
01:14:17,705 --> 01:14:19,926
So we have a return visit from Evely.

1010
01:14:20,546 --> 01:14:22,727
Straight from Market Basket.

1011
01:14:22,827 --> 01:14:23,327
Waitmans.

1012
01:14:23,347 --> 01:14:24,147
Stop and shop.

1013
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:24,727
Stop and shop.

1014
01:14:27,376 --> 01:14:31,159
This report was included in your packet last week.

1015
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:36,943
I hope you've had a chance to look it over, but we'd like to discuss it publicly tonight.

1016
01:14:38,904 --> 01:14:45,469
I'll start by just introducing the topic with regard to both schools that opened in 2001.

1017
01:14:46,309 --> 01:14:49,232
Both schools follow the same academic curriculum.

1018
01:14:50,012 --> 01:14:55,195
They have the full complement of exploratory subjects, such as art, music, and health.

1019
01:14:56,015 --> 01:15:01,118
There are the same number of guidance counselors, school psychologists, in both schools.

1020
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:14,765
The teaching staff are highly qualified teachers, all licensed, and while the nature of the activities may vary, they both offer, both schools offer after school activities.

1021
01:15:16,005 --> 01:15:20,210
One of the differences is the schools house different specialized population.

1022
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:28,961
The Andrews, for example, houses the therapeutic learning program, while the McGlynn houses all of our EL middle school students.

1023
01:15:30,573 --> 01:15:33,675
All content area classes are scheduled the same way.

1024
01:15:33,735 --> 01:15:37,897
Everyone has the same amount of time in English, math, social studies, and science.

1025
01:15:38,938 --> 01:15:48,083
The exploratories are scheduled slightly differently because of the different populations in the school and the fact that many of the EL kids don't take foreign language.

1026
01:15:48,163 --> 01:15:51,225
They need to have the exploratories in a different way.

1027
01:15:51,785 --> 01:15:56,548
But if you add up the time on a yearly basis, all students are getting the same amount of time.

1028
01:15:57,008 --> 01:16:05,974
It's just that in one school they're getting it throughout the school year on a lesser basis, and in the other school they get it more concentrated during one segment of the school year.

1029
01:16:06,578 --> 01:16:07,939
but time-wise it's the same.

1030
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:13,163
Inclusion is practiced in both schools.

1031
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:25,491
Again, since the opening of the new buildings in 2001, the district has offered parents of grade five students the opportunity to select a preferred middle school.

1032
01:16:26,372 --> 01:16:35,799
The system has worked well until the past two years, when a disproportionate number of parents of students entering grade six selected the Andrews.

1033
01:16:36,703 --> 01:16:44,147
Currently, the Andrews has 45, I'm sorry, 47 more students entering grade six than does the McGlynn.

1034
01:16:44,187 --> 01:16:48,950
And we can accommodate them through extra staffing, but again, it's not an ideal situation.

1035
01:16:50,388 --> 01:16:58,075
We also have a significant discrepancy in the socioeconomic status of the student populations at each school.

1036
01:16:58,095 --> 01:17:07,863
This is something that we do need to address more long-term, not tonight, but at other meetings that we need to have during the fall and during the winter.

1037
01:17:09,965 --> 01:17:38,455
In order to correct for this imbalance, administrators at all levels, we came together once we saw this happening this spring, and it was central administration, it was the departmental people, and the building, the principals obviously were involved, and we worked throughout the spring and summer to make some changes that we wanted to put in place at the beginning of the school year that we thought would address some of these issues with the discrepancies or the idea that people were selecting the Anders over the McGlynn.

1038
01:17:39,815 --> 01:17:56,917
We put some things in place and we are currently working on additional changes that can be put in place during the school year So just to kind of review what's happened at budget time the committee allowed the addition of one health teacher and

1039
01:17:57,352 --> 01:18:02,614
and one Spanish teacher for additional staff to be shared by the two middle schools.

1040
01:18:03,414 --> 01:18:11,698
We also added another EL teacher because that population at the McGlynn was growing leaps and bounds, and we wanted to make sure the students were supported.

1041
01:18:13,118 --> 01:18:19,061
And the previous year, we had already added a full-time librarian and a .5 adjustment counselor.

1042
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:22,282
So, we've been adding staff over the last couple of years.

1043
01:18:23,703 --> 01:18:24,443
During the summer,

1044
01:18:25,698 --> 01:18:30,042
There were several more measures that were put in place, and I'll review them with you.

1045
01:18:31,143 --> 01:18:43,373
We have new staff members that were hired to either fill vacancies or new positions that were created, and you have the list of all of those positions without the individual names of the teachers.

1046
01:18:44,214 --> 01:18:46,155
We have a new assistant principal in place.

1047
01:18:46,195 --> 01:18:48,377
We have two special education teachers.

1048
01:18:49,398 --> 01:18:52,341
We have a new reading teacher, an ELA teacher,

1049
01:18:53,101 --> 01:19:04,908
a guidance counselor, she's actually filling a leave of absence, the additional EL teacher, and then we have .5 health and .5 Spanish, that's the McGlynn.

1050
01:19:05,248 --> 01:19:07,630
The full-time was shared, the two full-time positions.

1051
01:19:09,084 --> 01:19:26,913
The second thing we did is we took a look at the background of staff, and we reassigned a few staff members to better serve the needs of students, and to support some of the newer staff, and to foster some of the new state required curriculum realignment.

1052
01:19:27,413 --> 01:19:30,435
Realignments happened in science, English, and mathematics.

1053
01:19:31,655 --> 01:19:36,758
So, these are the changes, without again, names, you have a confidential

1054
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,102
statement also attached with this that speaks to the science changes.

1055
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:46,346
Again, that statement does contain names, so that's why we have it marked confidential.

1056
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:54,753
But the changes dealt with changing a grade 7 teacher to grade 8 in science, and a grade 8 teacher to grade 7.

1057
01:19:55,293 --> 01:19:59,397
And this was based on the recommendations of Director Rocco Sieri.

1058
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:11,079
who knowing the background of both teachers, knowing the new frameworks, and the new frameworks realigned standards where they were taught in different grade levels, felt that that placement was warranted.

1059
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,260
So that was one of the changes that we made.

1060
01:20:15,502 --> 01:20:18,064
There was another change with the grade seven and eight

1061
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,962
English language arts teacher.

1062
01:20:20,743 --> 01:20:24,249
We hired a new English language arts teacher for the McGlynn.

1063
01:20:24,829 --> 01:20:32,140
This teacher was brand new, but her student teaching and her background in, you know, again, student teaching mainly was at the high school level.

1064
01:20:32,741 --> 01:20:34,844
We felt that putting her at grade eight

1065
01:20:35,217 --> 01:20:38,839
was the proper placement since, again, she was more high school oriented.

1066
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,041
That was one part of the decision making.

1067
01:20:42,081 --> 01:20:52,027
The second part was that the current eighth grade teacher, who's an excellent veteran teacher, we needed her expertise to go back into grade seven to help

1068
01:20:52,647 --> 01:21:00,950
The new reading teacher, in grade seven now, we're starting a new reading program, RTI, where we're going to identify students who really need the reading support.

1069
01:21:01,311 --> 01:21:11,795
Grade six, all students get reading, but now grade seven and eight, it's going to be students who really need it through our testing, our study island we purchased to be able to identify those students.

1070
01:21:12,155 --> 01:21:16,677
We felt that having a veteran seventh grade English teacher would assist that brand new reading teacher

1071
01:21:17,237 --> 01:21:20,060
in making those assessments and placements of students.

1072
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:22,562
So that was the rationale for that change.

1073
01:21:23,322 --> 01:21:34,052
Again, there was a grade eight team lateral change for two social studies teachers, again, teaching the same subject, teaching the same grade, just on different teams.

1074
01:21:34,092 --> 01:21:40,257
And that was a measure to balance the two teams with veteran teachers and also to have a little better gender balance.

1075
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:47,073
The change I mentioned before is the modification of how reading will be delivered.

1076
01:21:47,873 --> 01:21:54,036
It's going to be, again, the RTI model that currently exists at the Andrews with a great deal of success.

1077
01:21:55,036 --> 01:21:59,098
Again, all students in grade six will receive basic reading instruction.

1078
01:22:00,038 --> 01:22:08,162
Seven and eighth grade students will be given reading support based on needs as identified on the newly purchased assessment tool, Study Island.

1079
01:22:08,242 --> 01:22:10,983
So we purchased, Study Island has been at the Andrews.

1080
01:22:11,883 --> 01:22:18,369
Again, we were able to purchase it for the McGlynn through a new grant that Bernadette Riccadeli is overseeing, Title IV-A.

1081
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:25,375
And again, grade seven, ELA teachers, both grade seven teachers on both teams are very veteran.

1082
01:22:25,895 --> 01:22:33,402
They're excellent teachers, and we know they will provide a great amount of support for this new reading teacher as she gets started in her career.

1083
01:22:34,537 --> 01:22:50,622
What we're going to be working on during the school year, we want to make sure that students have opportunities to have more clubs at the McGlynn, and opportunities for students to be able to go to different clubs, even if they're housed at another school.

1084
01:22:51,123 --> 01:22:55,184
I know I had one parent, his daughter is really into theater and drama, and she's

1085
01:22:55,688 --> 01:23:01,916
At the McGlynn, he's asked that she could be in the production that's done at the Yanders, and we're working on that.

1086
01:23:02,256 --> 01:23:07,443
So we're trying to make sure that students are given the opportunity to join clubs at both schools.

1087
01:23:08,665 --> 01:23:22,459
We are having more administrative support in the building so that we have an idea if people have concerns that they know there's always a place they can go in addition to the principal and to the new assistant principal.

1088
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:26,223
Dr. Riccadeli is going to have and has had already.

1089
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:36,597
more of a presence in the school, walking around the halls, talking to the teachers, seeing, again, expressing her interest in what they're doing and if they have any concerns.

1090
01:23:37,358 --> 01:23:43,684
And also, Mr. Tixera, again, our new EL director, he is going to have a presence there.

1091
01:23:44,365 --> 01:23:46,167
Both people are going to have a presence.

1092
01:23:46,387 --> 01:23:50,971
an office, we're working on that, where they can actually sit and if a person wants to go to them, they can.

1093
01:23:51,451 --> 01:23:59,417
It was only natural to have Mr. Texera be there more because all of the EL middle school students and teachers are housed at the McGlynn.

1094
01:24:00,638 --> 01:24:07,544
We've already decided that we're gonna have the open house for grade five parents together, both principals presenting.

1095
01:24:08,352 --> 01:24:12,076
and then again having the tours of the buildings for the parents.

1096
01:24:13,277 --> 01:24:21,245
I think we need to, together, during the school year, work on some systemic changes to the protocols for the school selection.

1097
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:29,373
Because what's happened is it's resulted in this imbalance in both numbers, but not just numbers, but socioeconomic status.

1098
01:24:29,413 --> 01:24:31,214
And again, I believe it's,

1099
01:24:32,235 --> 01:24:36,878
20% free and reduced lunch at the Andrews and 40% at the McGlynn.

1100
01:24:36,918 --> 01:24:38,839
It's just like a huge discrepancy.

1101
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:47,304
So we have to together come up with a way for parents to have a voice in school selection, but get around this issue that's occurred this year.

1102
01:24:47,724 --> 01:24:51,406
And again, we'll have to sit down together and put all of our minds to that.

1103
01:24:54,262 --> 01:25:01,827
We're planning for more programs at the McGlynn to perhaps attract some students back to the McGlynn.

1104
01:25:02,827 --> 01:25:03,528
I know that Ms.

1105
01:25:03,588 --> 01:25:08,691
Liu and I have spoken already about an Odyssey of the Mind program, perhaps to go into the McGlynn.

1106
01:25:09,872 --> 01:25:11,293
Perhaps something around STEM.

1107
01:25:12,035 --> 01:25:13,576
which would be something beneficial.

1108
01:25:14,536 --> 01:25:23,459
And then we will look to move some EL classes back to the Andrews, similar to what occurred at the Roberts and the Brooks this year.

1109
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:36,863
The thinking was, we used to have EL students in both schools, and then about, I wanna say five years ago, we decided that we could actually use staff more efficiently if we had all of the students and all of the EL staff,

1110
01:25:37,418 --> 01:25:38,218
in one building.

1111
01:25:38,738 --> 01:25:39,919
But now the numbers have grown.

1112
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:46,181
So it's warranted that we could, again, have students move back and we would still not have.

1113
01:25:46,221 --> 01:25:53,703
What we're having before with so few EL students is that you'd have the EL teachers running between buildings and losing time having to travel.

1114
01:25:54,043 --> 01:25:57,384
But now we have so many more students, we feel we could have dedicated staff

1115
01:25:57,964 --> 01:25:58,624
at each building.

1116
01:25:59,004 --> 01:26:01,786
So we'll be looking to do that as well.

1117
01:26:02,726 --> 01:26:06,067
And as we move forward, we will keep the committee informed.

1118
01:26:06,107 --> 01:26:08,969
We'll look to you for some guidance on some of these large issues.

1119
01:26:09,549 --> 01:26:16,252
And again, we welcome your input as we move forward and do our best to make this a better situation.

1120
01:26:17,912 --> 01:26:18,072
Ms.

1121
01:26:18,092 --> 01:26:19,373
Vander Kloof.

1122
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:27,817
Beverly, one of the big concerns this year was for the students who wanted to go to the Andrews and didn't get into the Andrews.

1123
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:42,604
And you already note that we still have a 47 discrepancy, but it was more than that because there were parents of students who were very upset that this didn't work out well.

1124
01:26:44,265 --> 01:27:01,596
I'm hoping that we are tracking those students and making sure that we know that a guidance counselor, the principal knows who those students are and are tracking how they're doing, helping make sure that they're getting connected to other kids in the school.

1125
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:08,361
And this was clearly a great concern to the committee members.

1126
01:27:08,501 --> 01:27:10,082
So perhaps you could address that.

1127
01:27:11,855 --> 01:27:15,658
In terms of the number of parents that wanted, we had a wait list.

1128
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:18,361
We knew that- No, not in terms of that, Beverly.

1129
01:27:18,421 --> 01:27:21,123
What's being done now to make sure those students are- Oh, okay.

1130
01:27:21,564 --> 01:27:33,574
We have, again, what happened during the summer is that some parents that would call my office, they, again, had information that their student was the only student from that particular elementary school who wasn't going to the Andrews.

1131
01:27:34,426 --> 01:27:35,727
We said that's not the case.

1132
01:27:35,787 --> 01:27:41,714
Again, lists were made available of other students that were from the same school that were going to go to the McGlynn.

1133
01:27:42,695 --> 01:27:49,642
The principals are aware, Mr. Edwards is aware of the students that really wanted to go to the Andrews.

1134
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:50,643
He's working with them.

1135
01:27:52,091 --> 01:27:57,892
girl who wants to be in the production at the Andrews, we're working with her family to make sure she's doing that.

1136
01:27:58,612 --> 01:28:05,693
And again, we're reassuring parents, and I know a lot of that I did this summer, is that students adjust.

1137
01:28:06,493 --> 01:28:10,374
And you know, it's really beneficial sometimes to meet new students.

1138
01:28:10,394 --> 01:28:18,816
You're all gonna be together in the high school in a few short years, but we will make that transition for those students and those families that didn't get their first choice.

1139
01:28:19,196 --> 01:28:20,416
We'll make sure that they

1140
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:24,259
you know, it's duly noted and that they, again, dealt with.

1141
01:28:24,319 --> 01:28:29,223
But I haven't gotten any phone calls since school began, quite honestly.

1142
01:28:30,103 --> 01:28:37,189
So everybody seems to have, I don't know if you have any, but I haven't, it seems like people are settling in and kids are settling in.

1143
01:28:37,249 --> 01:28:45,055
Well, like I see that it says, you know, we have plans to have more clubs at the McGlynn or clubs where kids could both join.

1144
01:28:45,736 --> 01:28:48,038
And the thing is, I think we need to do that right away.

1145
01:28:48,638 --> 01:29:01,489
I want to see options so that those kids who feel that they're taken away from their friends have an opportunity to perhaps join something and not waiting until the second semester.

1146
01:29:01,949 --> 01:29:02,930
No, we've already spoken.

1147
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:05,472
Paul and Jake both have sat down with me and

1148
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:13,176
We're trying to see which clubs are the ones that, you know, more easily the kids can get to either school where they're gonna be housed.

1149
01:29:13,196 --> 01:29:15,918
So we're making a list, and as I said, you know, Ms.

1150
01:29:15,979 --> 01:29:26,908
Liu is very proactive, and she wants to get something going right away with, you know, at least that one club, and again, we're in the process of asking them what clubs they think that they want to add in.

1151
01:29:27,658 --> 01:29:37,220
and then making sure we have the funding for the stipends for the teachers to, you know, jump to basically oversee to be facilitators of these clubs.

1152
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:42,721
And we're hoping that the teachers are gonna jump at the opportunity to run something new as well.

1153
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:46,021
I think we usually plan for stipends to take place.

1154
01:29:46,101 --> 01:29:53,122
There is some, but we know we need additional, we need some additional ones and we're gonna prepare, we're prepared to entertain those requests.

1155
01:29:55,663 --> 01:29:56,083
Beth Stone.

1156
01:29:56,123 --> 01:29:56,363
Thanks.

1157
01:29:57,927 --> 01:30:01,629
You would mention what's I mean odyssey of the mind with miss Lou.

1158
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:04,111
So is that a gifted and talented program?

1159
01:30:04,271 --> 01:30:05,011
Yes Okay.

1160
01:30:05,131 --> 01:30:05,331
Yes.

1161
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:12,495
The thing is with the gifted and talented programs now Teachers that run them are supposed to have not a license.

1162
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:13,716
It's called an endorsement.

1163
01:30:14,216 --> 01:30:16,958
So we're looking to see who might have that endorsement or a

1164
01:30:17,597 --> 01:30:23,381
if the person needs to get the endorsement, what they have to do to get it, and then we'll help them to get that endorsement.

1165
01:30:23,421 --> 01:30:26,763
So there's a few little regulatory things that we have to look into.

1166
01:30:27,063 --> 01:30:29,724
And the same with that in the EL classes.

1167
01:30:29,844 --> 01:30:31,305
Are we looking for September of 2018 to

1168
01:30:32,746 --> 01:30:34,808
move half the EL to the Andrews?

1169
01:30:35,188 --> 01:30:37,330
Not maybe half, but maybe some of the programs.

1170
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:41,875
We'll take a look at what's going on and see what makes more sense.

1171
01:30:42,155 --> 01:30:51,744
Again, we don't want to overcrowd the Andrews because they already have too many kids already, so we want to move kids in unless we can make sure that things are going to be a little bit more balanced all around.

1172
01:30:52,264 --> 01:30:57,149
And then, I don't know, because it's been 20 months, so it might have happened before I was on.

1173
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:02,115
I was assigned to the Roberts for my children, and then I did not choose the Roberts.

1174
01:31:02,215 --> 01:31:06,379
I love the Roberts, I can't say enough about Mr. Johnson, but then I get to pick middle school.

1175
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,301
Why don't we just assign...

1176
01:31:09,383 --> 01:31:13,685
families to one or the other middle school, so you don't have kids who are on a wait list.

1177
01:31:13,705 --> 01:31:16,507
With your support, we could entertain that as one of the options.

1178
01:31:16,547 --> 01:31:24,451
Before you go down that road, our schools were built on a racial balance plan.

1179
01:31:25,051 --> 01:31:27,653
Schools were built with choice as one of the options.

1180
01:31:28,533 --> 01:31:33,655
And if we have to change that, we need to change the plan and get approval for it.

1181
01:31:33,695 --> 01:31:36,557
But I don't choose elementary, so weren't they built with the memo?

1182
01:31:36,597 --> 01:31:38,017
No, you could choose elementary.

1183
01:31:38,057 --> 01:31:40,999
See, one of the things is that people don't realize is when the schools were built,

1184
01:31:41,925 --> 01:31:46,088
The essential part was, first of all, the Andrews and McGuinn were the first two schools that were built.

1185
01:31:46,688 --> 01:31:51,771
So people, you know, it was a, let's say, a progressive movement of youngsters.

1186
01:31:52,412 --> 01:31:56,614
But you could have chosen certain schools after the other schools were built.

1187
01:31:57,194 --> 01:32:01,337
So there are plenty of people that have chosen schools outside of their geographical area.

1188
01:32:01,357 --> 01:32:02,338
It's happened all the time.

1189
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:04,338
But now people are getting settled.

1190
01:32:04,358 --> 01:32:05,338
They're getting comfortable.

1191
01:32:05,738 --> 01:32:08,379
And to some degree, things have sort of settled in.

1192
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:14,100
People sort of stay in their own geographic area for the most part, although there are some people that want to go to another school.

1193
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:22,921
One of the things that we've got to deal with is that we may want to look at redistricting to some degree, because the Columbus is somewhat under-enrolled compared to some of the others.

1194
01:32:23,882 --> 01:32:27,302
And if we change a few lines, we'd get a few more people over there.

1195
01:32:29,423 --> 01:32:30,403
Just got to look at those things.

1196
01:32:30,463 --> 01:32:31,443
I mean, it's all part of it.

1197
01:32:32,638 --> 01:32:36,442
Choice was part of the plan in getting 90 cents on the dollar.

1198
01:32:37,122 --> 01:32:44,069
Right, but it's not, to the family at home with a preschooler, no one thinks that we're a choice system.

1199
01:32:44,269 --> 01:32:46,431
Everyone thinks you go to the school closest to your house.

1200
01:32:46,672 --> 01:32:49,454
Well, you know, we get plenty of requests.

1201
01:32:49,555 --> 01:32:50,395
Maybe we don't see it.

1202
01:32:50,415 --> 01:32:50,756
You grant them.

1203
01:32:51,613 --> 01:32:53,034
We grant a lot of them.

1204
01:32:53,154 --> 01:32:55,615
But you don't see them because you didn't make that request.

1205
01:32:55,635 --> 01:32:57,136
But we grant a lot of requests.

1206
01:32:57,156 --> 01:32:58,917
We take a look at class size first.

1207
01:32:59,437 --> 01:33:03,299
We take a look at whether we think the trends are too much in one direction or the other.

1208
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:06,901
We look at the balance between different populations.

1209
01:33:07,701 --> 01:33:09,442
But we have granted quite a bit.

1210
01:33:09,462 --> 01:33:10,283
Diane, what would you say?

1211
01:33:11,243 --> 01:33:12,784
Because Diane handles the elementaries.

1212
01:33:14,677 --> 01:33:26,947
We do get a lot of requests for different areas in schools and for different reasons, but sometimes parents will send in a request because it's easier for them to get to work, to jump on to 93.

1213
01:33:27,448 --> 01:33:34,954
Sometimes we have requests from parents who have childcare issues and the childcare person is in another school.

1214
01:33:35,575 --> 01:33:40,519
So, you know, I can't give you a specific number, but we do get requests.

1215
01:33:40,539 --> 01:33:41,400
I know, but we're not,

1216
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,081
Selling ourselves.

1217
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:48,203
I don't go in with my four-year-old and say Roberts number one Columbus number two.

1218
01:33:48,283 --> 01:33:54,666
I don't there's really not a choice system So let's know unless you make the request you're going to write your school.

1219
01:33:54,686 --> 01:33:57,207
You register your child.

1220
01:33:57,387 --> 01:34:06,791
I am So it's an interesting thing but there's always been over the course of all the years that they've been open that there are families who asked to go to one school or another and

1221
01:34:06,831 --> 01:34:10,033
Right, who are in the know to write a letter or an email.

1222
01:34:10,053 --> 01:34:14,755
But when you go to register your child, it doesn't say you get to choose the elementary school you want to go to.

1223
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:17,516
They say to me, you live on Morgan Ave, you go to the Roberts.

1224
01:34:17,837 --> 01:34:24,320
And unless you are informed or active on Facebook Medford Moms, you don't know that you can choose what school to go to.

1225
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:37,485
Well, I guess it's been less of a drive for people to do that, but over the years, I can assure you people came in frequently asking to go to one school or the other.

1226
01:34:37,665 --> 01:34:46,268
Right, but if we are, for middle school you would get a choice, one or two, but we don't get that for elementary school.

1227
01:34:46,308 --> 01:34:49,309
I'm just saying then why do we give a choice at the middle school?

1228
01:34:50,638 --> 01:34:56,201
Well, then you would have a situation where certain sections of the city would populate one school and some would populate the other school.

1229
01:34:56,341 --> 01:34:58,902
Not if we do a random lottery for kids going to middle school.

1230
01:34:58,962 --> 01:35:01,484
Well, then no one gets a choice, you know what I mean?

1231
01:35:01,584 --> 01:35:07,107
So, you know, this trade-off, so all of these systems, you know, for the most part it's worked.

1232
01:35:07,167 --> 01:35:09,948
This is a year where we have one real aberration.

1233
01:35:09,968 --> 01:35:15,231
If you look at the rest of the enrollment at the Andrews and the McGlinn, it's within a few students of each other.

1234
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:16,912
No, because you said,

1235
01:35:17,977 --> 01:35:20,918
the McGlynn used to be the choice school and they had over enrollment.

1236
01:35:21,418 --> 01:35:22,458
But not to this level.

1237
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:24,458
Not at this level.

1238
01:35:24,698 --> 01:35:26,599
This is an aberration this particular year.

1239
01:35:27,519 --> 01:35:28,259
Point of information.

1240
01:35:28,279 --> 01:35:43,382
Yeah, point of information on this was that the choice of elementary schools really came into place when we were building the so-called new schools now because we were going from our neighborhood schools to the larger schools.

1241
01:35:43,922 --> 01:35:45,963
And because we also did it in a phase way,

1242
01:35:47,101 --> 01:35:59,091
We had parents that felt that they wanted to wait that extra year either in their neighborhood school, and then it got to a point where because one school was built before the other, that's how the choices came.

1243
01:35:59,572 --> 01:36:03,715
But over the years now, I know that like the last 12 years that I've been here,

1244
01:36:04,776 --> 01:36:08,299
what's happened is we've kind of, it's always an option.

1245
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:22,751
Maybe it's not publicized, and maybe the reason we haven't really done that is because there was other complications that come with it too, is that people that started with that, so we've always honored like the siblings, if they were on one side and they went to another school, we've honored that.

1246
01:36:22,811 --> 01:36:28,055
We've honored other things that people knew about, but we also have to take into consideration the buses.

1247
01:36:28,615 --> 01:36:32,699
We have to take into consideration that as before, you don't want to have one school

1248
01:36:33,819 --> 01:36:37,701
really to the max, and you kind of do want to leave.

1249
01:36:38,281 --> 01:36:46,024
I know our schools are in a different type of neighborhood, but parents have actually opted to stay within the system, or within their district.

1250
01:36:46,684 --> 01:36:50,506
I shouldn't say district, within their neighborhood, let's say, in a larger way.

1251
01:36:51,046 --> 01:36:57,749
When it came to the middle school, it was always more of a choice, and I think that's the reason we've gone that way.

1252
01:36:58,249 --> 01:36:59,849
So they sit on a campus together.

1253
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:12,273
So they started off that way, but then over the years it wasn't like we said No, it wouldn't happen if you wanted to pick a different one But we highly advised parents, you know Where are you living?

1254
01:37:12,533 --> 01:37:20,395
How you know your social life and and as miss Caldwell said, you know if you're going to work or things like that, whereas you're

1255
01:37:21,575 --> 01:37:26,517
I mean, we've had situations because our children, some of the children have decided to go to the McGlynn Middle School.

1256
01:37:27,197 --> 01:37:32,199
Their children stayed in the McGlynn Elementary School because that's, it was a better thing for them.

1257
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:42,023
But, I mean, I don't remember in the last few years that we've actually gone out there and publicized that there's a huge choice, and I think it's done because of other expenses that are involved, too.

1258
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:47,065
But with that being said, if parents have called, they have been given that choice.

1259
01:37:51,854 --> 01:38:00,462
I want to address this question in particular because I had a number of parents say that they weren't able to get into the school of their choice.

1260
01:38:00,882 --> 01:38:02,003
This happened to me twice now.

1261
01:38:02,344 --> 01:38:02,524
Right.

1262
01:38:02,584 --> 01:38:06,608
There was a school that was closer to them and one parent was so outraged

1263
01:38:07,148 --> 01:38:11,193
That they were like, oh, if Medford is going to treat me this way, I'm going to take my kids to private school.

1264
01:38:11,233 --> 01:38:12,094
Elementary or middle?

1265
01:38:12,655 --> 01:38:13,076
Elementary.

1266
01:38:13,136 --> 01:38:14,658
Elementary school.

1267
01:38:15,038 --> 01:38:17,862
And I just want to know, what percent does this happen?

1268
01:38:18,522 --> 01:38:20,825
Because, I mean, you know, I've only heard one side of the story.

1269
01:38:23,371 --> 01:38:27,473
Well, I think that there were a few situations where we were concerned about class size.

1270
01:38:28,314 --> 01:38:33,156
And so there was some desire to maybe we should move people to one school or the other.

1271
01:38:33,576 --> 01:38:37,058
Some cases, it could be transportation situations that were in there.

1272
01:38:37,098 --> 01:38:38,179
But Diane, you may want to.

1273
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,380
No, it's usually.

1274
01:38:41,202 --> 01:38:43,143
We usually look at class size issues.

1275
01:38:43,263 --> 01:38:50,685
And when we have kindergartens or different grade levels that begin to fill up, we certainly don't want to put additional students in that school.

1276
01:38:50,765 --> 01:38:59,228
So if, for instance, there was a child and one of the classes was only 17 or 19 students, we would accommodate.

1277
01:38:59,288 --> 01:39:01,009
And in the past, we have accommodated them.

1278
01:39:01,743 --> 01:39:09,725
But I think your question is someone that lives in that school district neighborhood, whatever we want to refer to it as, didn't get to go to that school.

1279
01:39:09,785 --> 01:39:10,485
That's not true.

1280
01:39:10,545 --> 01:39:11,585
I haven't heard of that at all.

1281
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:12,546
It's not someone in the neighborhood.

1282
01:39:12,566 --> 01:39:12,606
No.

1283
01:39:12,686 --> 01:39:20,668
If they're designated, for instance, if it's a Brooks School student, and in their designated neighborhood, they all went to that school.

1284
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:21,288
That's what I heard.

1285
01:39:21,328 --> 01:39:21,648
It's probably.

1286
01:39:21,668 --> 01:39:22,888
Yeah, they have fresh choice.

1287
01:39:23,368 --> 01:39:29,049
There was the way the district lines worked out, that they were closer to one, but they weren't, they requested.

1288
01:39:29,109 --> 01:39:30,770
I just want to get a sense of what percentage.

1289
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:32,211
that happens?

1290
01:39:32,371 --> 01:39:34,032
Very small, very small.

1291
01:39:34,332 --> 01:39:36,073
When was the last time you redistricted?

1292
01:39:36,133 --> 01:39:36,974
One at a time please.

1293
01:39:38,235 --> 01:39:40,136
Long time ago, long time ago.

1294
01:39:40,376 --> 01:39:42,138
When we opened the schools probably.

1295
01:39:42,418 --> 01:39:48,122
There was one redistricting that took place probably three or four years in and that's it.

1296
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:49,102
It's been a while.

1297
01:39:50,523 --> 01:39:51,564
Mr. Benedetto?

1298
01:39:53,145 --> 01:39:55,467
So I think I live in that neighborhood.

1299
01:39:56,305 --> 01:40:02,851
that it used to be like North Street, and it used to be Winthrop Street over, you go to the Brooks, and then they redistricted it.

1300
01:40:03,411 --> 01:40:07,335
And I didn't realize at the time it had been redistricted.

1301
01:40:07,515 --> 01:40:14,641
So when people were talking to me, this was prior to me being on the Smoothman, I was like, yeah, you just go down the street to the Brooks.

1302
01:40:15,101 --> 01:40:19,545
But they had redistricted it, so it went to North Street, down, went to the Brooks.

1303
01:40:19,585 --> 01:40:20,186
It was a Columbus.

1304
01:40:21,142 --> 01:40:35,428
from North Street over was redistricted to the Columbus School, which wasn't as close, and where some people, like on my street, would have been able to walk their children to school, now live much further.

1305
01:40:35,948 --> 01:40:48,914
So I think that's more what the concern was, and I have heard people in the Hillside area make comments like, I could walk my child every day, but I can't, it's too far,

1306
01:40:50,052 --> 01:40:56,934
Now I have to bus them or bring them and it's because of that last redistricting.

1307
01:40:57,494 --> 01:40:59,774
It's possible that there was a miscommunication.

1308
01:40:59,794 --> 01:41:11,577
I'll talk to the parent and see if we can forward that information to you guys, but it was that exact issue that she could walk it, but now she can't walk and she was very frustrated at the response she received from the school district.

1309
01:41:11,977 --> 01:41:13,117
I'm sure it was just a miscommunication.

1310
01:41:13,137 --> 01:41:15,398
So let me give you a little bit on that too, just to think about it.

1311
01:41:15,418 --> 01:41:16,178
When the schools were built,

1312
01:41:17,848 --> 01:41:25,939
The two schools that sort of had a lock on the Brooks were the Dame and the Hervey and Gleason.

1313
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:29,524
Those were the three, but there was a whole portion of people that went to the Dame.

1314
01:41:30,478 --> 01:41:36,123
that we needed to take to the Columbus because we would have had the Columbus even more underpopulated than it is today.

1315
01:41:36,903 --> 01:41:48,373
So there was a need to make a division on that side of the river and move it towards the Columbus or else we would have had an underpopulated school in South Medford and an overpopulated school in West Medford.

1316
01:41:48,793 --> 01:41:50,755
So that was the sort of divide there.

1317
01:41:50,815 --> 01:41:52,716
And of course, with busing transportation,

1318
01:41:53,397 --> 01:41:54,598
we felt it was very doable.

1319
01:41:54,618 --> 01:41:56,578
That was the thinking at the time.

1320
01:41:56,819 --> 01:42:02,781
Yeah, it's not that, I don't think there was any malfeasance or practice on anyone's part, it was just a question of miscommunication.

1321
01:42:03,241 --> 01:42:11,485
And I just wanted to get a sense of how often that happens for parents, because as well, many parents don't think that they do have a choice, at least in my experience when talking to them.

1322
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:15,227
So just to follow up, as a committee member, I do hear that as well.

1323
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:22,554
So when we did it, it was very unpopular.

1324
01:42:23,374 --> 01:42:26,337
And there were many, many parents who were extremely concerned.

1325
01:42:27,358 --> 01:42:32,624
One of the things which now is I hear so many positive things.

1326
01:42:33,184 --> 01:42:47,034
about the Columbus that I think that parents, I've not heard anywhere near the level of concern because once people go and meet Mrs. K, they're so happy and the school is such a positive place to be.

1327
01:42:47,594 --> 01:42:50,216
So I just haven't heard

1328
01:42:51,397 --> 01:42:57,919
that level, the ugliest word of being a school committee member is probably redistricting.

1329
01:42:58,579 --> 01:43:00,199
I mean, really positive.

1330
01:43:00,259 --> 01:43:04,800
And Mia, you nearly took my breath away when you said, why don't we just do a lottery and have them do that?

1331
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:15,143
Well, that might be something we're gonna talk about, but we're gonna make a lot of people unhappy no matter what we do when we talk about this type of things of equity between choice in schools.

1332
01:43:15,263 --> 01:43:20,484
It's a very difficult thing as a school committee member, because we are naturally people who want to please.

1333
01:43:21,584 --> 01:43:28,428
And unfortunately, when you make that type of decision, you're gonna not make everybody, it's impossible to make everybody happy.

1334
01:43:28,468 --> 01:43:37,353
So what we have to concentrate on is we have to look at the total population of kids and say, what is the most equitable thing for our student body?

1335
01:43:37,654 --> 01:43:38,834
And how are we making sure?

1336
01:43:38,954 --> 01:43:43,057
And one of the things is when you go into those school buildings, you will see

1337
01:43:43,557 --> 01:44:02,007
that they all have the same, they have a gym, they have a library, they have a, because we were so concerned at the time of building them, that wherever a student in Medford went, that they would have an equitable building and environment to learn in, and also populate as close as we can with the same kind of draws.

1338
01:44:02,908 --> 01:44:09,995
This is, when I've been on the committee, the McGlynn at one point was more popular, and then it became the Andrews, and then it became the McGlynn.

1339
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:16,701
We've never had such an inequity as we did this year, and hopefully we won't again.

1340
01:44:17,022 --> 01:44:20,105
But we clearly have to take steps this year to look at it.

1341
01:44:20,485 --> 01:44:24,990
And in the meantime, my concern is the well-being of the students who didn't want to go, so.

1342
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:41,154
Yeah, the parents I spoke with, I have to talk with them obviously, but I'll forward you the information if they agree, they felt they were sort of pushed into the Columbus, and I think that that was just, whether it was the reality or the perception, I just, maybe it's a question of just clearing it out.

1343
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:44,374
We don't want to have one school which has 300 kids in one school.

1344
01:44:44,394 --> 01:44:46,235
Of course, and that's the challenge, of course.

1345
01:44:46,595 --> 01:44:47,495
Very good, thanks Mike.

1346
01:44:47,675 --> 01:44:48,015
Thank you.

1347
01:44:48,055 --> 01:44:51,216
Is there a motion to receive this paper and place it on file?

1348
01:44:51,236 --> 01:44:51,616
So moved.

1349
01:44:52,016 --> 01:44:54,637
I just had a question, if you don't mind.

1350
01:44:55,517 --> 01:45:02,484
It was about Study Island, how much that costs, and why has Andrews had it for a while and McGlenn not?

1351
01:45:04,506 --> 01:45:19,920
Study Island, Mr. DeLava had put that in his regular budget for several years because he wanted to have that reading instruction to be delivered in terms of the RTI.

1352
01:45:21,141 --> 01:45:25,144
Because of the way the scheduling was done That wasn't done the same way.

1353
01:45:25,164 --> 01:45:26,846
It's the McGlynn that was not the need for it.

1354
01:45:26,906 --> 01:45:38,355
We said we have to do it differently Okay, we need to make sure that the two schools are doing RTI and that they have the materials that they need Study Island for both math.

1355
01:45:38,415 --> 01:45:45,961
It's a very it's a very good diagnostic tool for both of them we were able to I think we're under like $4,000 at the McGlynn

1356
01:45:48,623 --> 01:45:56,787
What we did at budget time, we did include it at the McGlynn budget, but then we were able to get this new grant this summer that paid for it.

1357
01:45:57,287 --> 01:46:01,249
So we could put the money back in and probably use it for stipends for clubs, so.

1358
01:46:01,970 --> 01:46:16,497
Okay, at budget time, we heard from people that RTI was extremely important and a few committee members were really focused on this as being a budget item, and now it wasn't,

1359
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:27,742
At budget time and now we're purchasing stuff like we talked about staff maybe for RTI and there was talk about using people in the building

1360
01:46:29,182 --> 01:46:29,922
That's elementary.

1361
01:46:30,182 --> 01:46:38,606
The middle school, Dr. Chiesa had put the study island in her English budget for the McGlynn because she knew it was used at the Andrews very effectively.

1362
01:46:39,126 --> 01:46:46,849
But again, we can throw that money back into something else because we have this brand new Title IV-A grant that we can support that.

1363
01:46:46,869 --> 01:46:50,631
The plan was to have it at the McGlynn this year, okay?

1364
01:46:51,111 --> 01:46:54,452
Great, so my other comment is about the clubs.

1365
01:46:55,893 --> 01:47:08,817
Now, Mr. DeLaver has been here for years asking more and more money for the clubs because they're so popular and because it makes the children feel a part of that community and the social piece is so important.

1366
01:47:08,837 --> 01:47:12,158
And I think that is a big draw for the middle schoolers.

1367
01:47:12,498 --> 01:47:16,359
And I remember either myself or someone else asking

1368
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:21,445
Why can't we open it up to the McGlynn kids and have them go back and forth?

1369
01:47:21,645 --> 01:47:27,812
He said they've tried it on a few occasions if I remember correctly I wish he was here and that it really doesn't always work

1370
01:47:29,021 --> 01:47:32,705
So I just want to make sure that we figure out a way that it does work.

1371
01:47:33,126 --> 01:47:41,056
And I want not only the McGlynn kids to go over to Andrew's to take part, I want some really cool things at the McGlynn that draws those kids over.

1372
01:47:41,957 --> 01:47:47,223
Because I really want, you know, the McGlynn has a little bit more space with them.

1373
01:47:48,386 --> 01:48:02,816
In talking to the principals, one of the issues with having the kids, let's say, from the McGlynn go to a club at the Andrews, is just we have to make sure the safety issue, that the kids are, because they're not as well known in the school.

1374
01:48:03,136 --> 01:48:10,060
So we have to make sure we have systems in place that those kids, they're supposed to be coming over from the McGlynn, they're truly there, okay?

1375
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:14,063
And that was the concern that they identified this past week.

1376
01:48:14,678 --> 01:48:24,048
So the drama club that is excellent and is well-reviewed at the Andrews School, could it be housed at the McGlynn?

1377
01:48:24,849 --> 01:48:25,470
Or not?

1378
01:48:25,570 --> 01:48:29,955
Because the McGlynn has the auditorium.

1379
01:48:31,036 --> 01:48:32,658
The teacher is at the Andrews.

1380
01:48:32,678 --> 01:48:34,740
I guess that's how that happened, the teacher that runs it.

1381
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:36,782
But the McGlynn has- Is it after school?

1382
01:48:37,931 --> 01:48:41,252
It's after school and the McGlynn has the talent show though.

1383
01:48:41,632 --> 01:48:45,474
So I mean they both have you know structures in place for the arts.

1384
01:48:45,534 --> 01:49:00,320
It's just different Okay, but we but we can like I said that one that one student again The father wrote me an email the students at the McGlynn But she'd like to participate in the drama because that's her her real passion and we're working to get her over there.

1385
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:00,860
So I

1386
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:05,243
so I'm sure there's other children as well, and I would like it open to them as well.

1387
01:49:06,285 --> 01:49:06,725
Mayor Burke.

1388
01:49:07,045 --> 01:49:07,206
Ms.

1389
01:49:07,246 --> 01:49:07,726
Vandiver.

1390
01:49:07,806 --> 01:49:10,950
I think there's a reality that needs to be mentioned.

1391
01:49:13,273 --> 01:49:14,494
The teacher is extraordinary.

1392
01:49:14,875 --> 01:49:18,999
She does an extraordinary job getting all of those students onto the stage.

1393
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:25,483
I don't know if there's room one inch that is not covered by- She had a hundred last year.

1394
01:49:25,603 --> 01:49:25,803
Right.

1395
01:49:26,083 --> 01:49:39,630
So either we convince her and she would probably kill her because she tells us to do it at the other school as well, or we have someone else run a drama program at the McGlynn that's equally popular.

1396
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:43,152
Because to just say, okay, every student,

1397
01:49:44,472 --> 01:49:54,836
I understand about the student that you're talking about, but frankly, airing this, I bet tomorrow morning you're gonna have 25 calls of kids who hear this.

1398
01:49:55,136 --> 01:49:57,017
I won't be in tomorrow, Mr. Superintendent.

1399
01:49:58,618 --> 01:50:03,119
So perhaps we have to think about running a drama program.

1400
01:50:03,559 --> 01:50:09,402
We have some new music teachers, I know that, that we hired, and I'll talk to Mrs. Igni about maybe doing that.

1401
01:50:10,362 --> 01:50:11,743
The teacher is extraordinary.

1402
01:50:12,344 --> 01:50:13,064
She's amazing.

1403
01:50:13,765 --> 01:50:20,549
I was at the farmers market in North Andover on a Sunday last week and it's Mrs. Nelson, Mrs. Nelson, there she was volunteering up there.

1404
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:21,690
So she's extraordinary.

1405
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:26,093
So I know that some people might disagree with this, but I'm going to say it anyway.

1406
01:50:26,994 --> 01:50:32,978
This is that when one school draws a little bit more than the other school, the other school has to want to compete.

1407
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:34,560
The other school has to want to

1408
01:50:35,554 --> 01:50:45,964
pick up the energy and to try and find ways to bring people, because they should take pride in their development and making some things happen instead of saying, oh, I don't know what was made.

1409
01:50:46,364 --> 01:50:47,906
I think there's a certain amount of that.

1410
01:50:47,926 --> 01:50:49,727
And I've said this to some of you as we've talked.

1411
01:50:50,108 --> 01:50:53,991
The culture at one place is not as energetic as the culture at the other.

1412
01:50:54,472 --> 01:50:55,653
And we've got to change that.

1413
01:50:55,693 --> 01:50:58,956
And that's part of the reasons why we made some of the changes we made.

1414
01:50:59,637 --> 01:51:00,457
Sending a message.

1415
01:51:01,138 --> 01:51:02,219
And that's the way you do it.

1416
01:51:02,259 --> 01:51:03,040
You have to do it.

1417
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:11,086
You know, when we talked about in the past, McGlynn was taking over the place and the Andrews was falling backwards after a number of years.

1418
01:51:11,346 --> 01:51:13,448
And we sent a message and we changed some things.

1419
01:51:13,508 --> 01:51:18,972
So it's not perfect, but it's an attempt to send a message and say, come on, you want to be

1420
01:51:20,393 --> 01:51:24,196
The school of choice, you want to bring people to you, and you've got to step it up a little bit.

1421
01:51:24,596 --> 01:51:28,919
And that happens, it happens in sports, it happens in the arts, it happens in academics.

1422
01:51:29,399 --> 01:51:34,123
I don't believe in competition as the only way of doing it, but sometimes there's a little competition that's useful.

1423
01:51:34,852 --> 01:51:39,455
With the federal funding, you said they had to be schools with a similar student population.

1424
01:51:40,475 --> 01:51:41,296
Not federal.

1425
01:51:41,316 --> 01:51:43,057
State, sorry, not federal.

1426
01:51:43,477 --> 01:51:46,979
But how does the Andrews have 20% low and reduced?

1427
01:51:46,999 --> 01:51:49,961
It didn't have to be the same population, it had to be within ranges.

1428
01:51:50,421 --> 01:51:53,462
But 20% to 44% for that subgroup is pretty big.

1429
01:51:53,582 --> 01:51:54,322
It's a change.

1430
01:51:54,442 --> 01:51:58,184
And because part of it is the growth of the Yale population has changed a lot.

1431
01:51:58,204 --> 01:52:01,605
I mean, that was not as significant years ago.

1432
01:52:02,065 --> 01:52:02,985
It's now significant.

1433
01:52:03,025 --> 01:52:05,106
It's now emerged, and it will continue to emerge.

1434
01:52:05,126 --> 01:52:06,326
So that's a new challenge for us.

1435
01:52:06,346 --> 01:52:07,967
And it was part of a racial balance plan back then as well.

1436
01:52:08,147 --> 01:52:09,088
It's a new challenge for us.

1437
01:52:09,428 --> 01:52:11,850
But again, you know, we work at these things.

1438
01:52:11,910 --> 01:52:14,252
And, you know, every year there's going to be challenges.

1439
01:52:14,292 --> 01:52:14,912
This is one of them.

1440
01:52:15,453 --> 01:52:16,233
And we'll make it work.

1441
01:52:16,273 --> 01:52:16,794
We'll get on it.

1442
01:52:16,834 --> 01:52:17,954
We've got a lot of things moving.

1443
01:52:18,195 --> 01:52:19,175
We've talked about a lot.

1444
01:52:19,215 --> 01:52:21,657
We're certainly not being satisfied about it.

1445
01:52:22,278 --> 01:52:23,439
We're saying, let's go make it happen.

1446
01:52:23,479 --> 01:52:24,960
But we need everybody on board.

1447
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,742
It can't be, woe is me, you know, they did something to me.

1448
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:49,537
I just had one more question a little bit back to earlier in your report you mentioned to us the teacher changes and I'm wondering if that's because are where the teachers willing to do that or where are they are we going to see grievances at some point I just wondered

1449
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:53,721
We did not change any one subject they taught.

1450
01:52:54,041 --> 01:52:55,242
We changed grade levels.

1451
01:52:56,403 --> 01:52:58,964
No one likes change, quite honestly.

1452
01:52:59,344 --> 01:53:02,385
And again, we exhibited some resistance.

1453
01:53:02,525 --> 01:53:07,668
But again, we didn't put an English teacher in a math class.

1454
01:53:08,437 --> 01:53:10,980
and contractually we have the ability to write.

1455
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:23,131
The middle school, you know, I taught middle school for 23 years, okay, and I, you know, I was at the Roberts for 13 years, and all of a sudden, what was the superintendent said, you have to go to the Lincoln.

1456
01:53:23,511 --> 01:53:24,312
Was I happy?

1457
01:53:24,713 --> 01:53:25,914
No, I was not happy.

1458
01:53:26,314 --> 01:53:27,735
Was I fine when I got there?

1459
01:53:27,795 --> 01:53:29,016
Was I a better teacher?

1460
01:53:29,596 --> 01:53:30,277
Absolutely.

1461
01:53:30,737 --> 01:53:38,323
I think that the middle school is the only level of teaching where a person could conceivably stay in the same job year after year.

1462
01:53:38,683 --> 01:53:41,265
Elementary teachers go from grade to grade.

1463
01:53:41,765 --> 01:53:44,027
High school teachers teach different subjects.

1464
01:53:44,127 --> 01:53:47,189
Every year you might be a world history teacher, then you might be a U.S.

1465
01:53:47,249 --> 01:53:47,870
history teacher.

1466
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:55,592
In rethinking all of this, quite honestly, what perhaps we should have learned, you know, we went from the three middle schools to the two.

1467
01:53:55,612 --> 01:54:01,614
And I spent that summer drying tears how this person couldn't possibly teach without their teammate.

1468
01:54:02,234 --> 01:54:08,976
And I said to people, if you feel this strongly after a year, come back and see me and we'll think about moving you back.

1469
01:54:09,456 --> 01:54:10,597
No one came back to see me.

1470
01:54:11,377 --> 01:54:22,702
I think change is healthy, I think it's very healthy for a teacher who's an 8th grade teacher to be a 7th grade teacher because that 8th grade teacher knows what a 7th grade student has to do to get to 8th grade.

1471
01:54:23,382 --> 01:54:29,105
And I think it's very healthy and we're not asking them to teach outside of their license, their content area.

1472
01:54:29,765 --> 01:54:31,206
There were needs in that school.

1473
01:54:31,286 --> 01:54:33,186
We had a brand new reading teacher.

1474
01:54:33,627 --> 01:54:36,828
She needed veteran English teachers to support her.

1475
01:54:36,848 --> 01:54:38,509
That new English teacher that was hired

1476
01:54:39,309 --> 01:54:42,410
would not have been able to help her in the way the veteran teacher was.

1477
01:54:42,430 --> 01:54:42,570
Sure.

1478
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:43,270
I understand.

1479
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:48,151
I was just curious why you were making, you know, informing the committee specifically.

1480
01:54:48,171 --> 01:54:51,212
I mean, obviously, it's useful for us to know, but I just was curious.

1481
01:54:51,232 --> 01:54:54,933
Well, we want you to know what we did because you might get phone calls, I'm sure.

1482
01:54:55,213 --> 01:54:55,473
Okay.

1483
01:54:55,573 --> 01:55:01,035
And Mr. Cieri came tonight because he wanted to speak if there was a question about the science.

1484
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:05,459
Obviously, we did this with his blessing and recommendation.

1485
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,922
Science frameworks are new, and he knows his people best.

1486
01:55:09,163 --> 01:55:11,665
And that change was, again, for the best.

1487
01:55:11,705 --> 01:55:12,466
Are people happy?

1488
01:55:13,347 --> 01:55:14,208
No one likes change.

1489
01:55:14,508 --> 01:55:15,149
But you know what?

1490
01:55:15,349 --> 01:55:15,909
It's healthy.

1491
01:55:15,949 --> 01:55:16,290
It's good.

1492
01:55:16,350 --> 01:55:16,970
I went through it.

1493
01:55:17,331 --> 01:55:18,332
I was a better teacher.

1494
01:55:19,071 --> 01:55:21,854
You know, I thought, how could I possibly leave my classroom in the Roberts?

1495
01:55:22,175 --> 01:55:24,297
I could teach from my car by the time I got through.

1496
01:55:24,338 --> 01:55:28,082
I mean, you just become more flexible, and you meet new people, and you get new ideas.

1497
01:55:28,443 --> 01:55:29,564
So it's healthy.

1498
01:55:29,644 --> 01:55:32,428
It's just not pleasant to go through, initially.

1499
01:55:32,608 --> 01:55:32,728
OK.

1500
01:55:33,028 --> 01:55:33,269
Thanks.

1501
01:55:33,289 --> 01:55:34,210
Thank you.

1502
01:55:36,998 --> 01:55:37,959
One more question here.

1503
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:47,545
If a parent has trouble reading, perhaps, the form for admissions, what's the default school that they get sent to if they don't return the form to you?

1504
01:55:47,925 --> 01:55:49,947
Is it that they get defaults to McGlynn?

1505
01:55:50,247 --> 01:55:56,171
Well, they would default it to the McGlynn now because that was the school that was essentially under-enrolled, the sixth grade, so.

1506
01:55:58,958 --> 01:55:59,358
Very good.

1507
01:55:59,418 --> 01:56:02,360
Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

1508
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:02,900
Second.

1509
01:56:02,980 --> 01:56:05,581
All those in favor?

1510
01:56:05,601 --> 01:56:05,941
Aye.

1511
01:56:06,182 --> 01:56:07,022
All those opposed?

1512
01:56:07,062 --> 01:56:08,022
Motion passes.

1513
01:56:09,103 --> 01:56:13,065
Report on enrollment impact of new real estate development in Medford.

1514
01:56:14,045 --> 01:56:21,669
So this is a report you asked for and it's timely because I'll be at the City Council tomorrow night and there's at least three motions on the agenda.

1515
01:56:22,096 --> 01:56:24,279
to ask me these questions, okay?

1516
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:28,085
But I think you should be very pleased when you look at the details here.

1517
01:56:28,145 --> 01:56:31,890
So I'm going to go through it a little bit because I think it's really a significant report.

1518
01:56:32,692 --> 01:56:36,898
So it's designed to show school enrollment impact of new real estate development in Medford.

1519
01:56:37,776 --> 01:56:43,321
This report looks at eight real estate complexes that contain 150 units or more.

1520
01:56:43,902 --> 01:56:46,645
We didn't look at the baby ones here and there because that would be too small.

1521
01:56:47,365 --> 01:56:55,974
The attached chart identifies each complex and provides information on the total number of enrolled students and their distributions across each of our schools.

1522
01:56:57,317 --> 01:57:04,500
The overall initial enrollment in our schools is 4,257 students, which is 54 students higher than last year at this time.

1523
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:09,722
This number is going to grow moderately as we get to October, because that's the way things happen.

1524
01:57:11,542 --> 01:57:14,443
The total number of students living in these eight complexes is 105.

1525
01:57:15,964 --> 01:57:17,764
Two of the students are in outside placements.

1526
01:57:18,565 --> 01:57:24,227
Overall, the enrollments from these eight complexes is 2.4% of our total school population.

1527
01:57:25,012 --> 01:57:31,555
Given existing class sizes and space capacity, the enrollment from these developments has no significant effect.

1528
01:57:32,616 --> 01:57:38,179
The average class size of our elementary schools is 18.3 students in the regular education classrooms.

1529
01:57:38,899 --> 01:57:50,525
I provided a chart that details the grade level distribution, another chart that looks at each school, a third chart that shows enrollment distribution by complex in school, and a fourth chart that shows the enrollment percentage by school.

1530
01:57:51,438 --> 01:57:57,360
Our elementary schools could enroll an additional 500 students and still be within our contractual limits for class size.

1531
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:06,682
We could enroll an additional 155 students and still maintain an average class size below 20 students, given normal distributions.

1532
01:58:07,582 --> 01:58:10,423
Our middle schools were built for 1,200 students.

1533
01:58:11,023 --> 01:58:12,824
We currently have 937.

1534
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:17,565
Overall, our middle school class size in the four major course subjects is around 20 students.

1535
01:58:18,652 --> 01:58:22,596
So again, our class size is excellent, but we have plenty of capacity.

1536
01:58:22,616 --> 01:58:24,278
People are saying there's no capacity anymore.

1537
01:58:24,579 --> 01:58:27,242
The new developments are going to swamp the schools.

1538
01:58:27,642 --> 01:58:28,243
Not true.

1539
01:58:29,286 --> 01:58:31,527
The high school vocational program has room to grow.

1540
01:58:32,128 --> 01:58:35,770
Space utilization could be adjusted if necessary to increase enrollment substantially.

1541
01:58:36,230 --> 01:58:40,832
For example, moving the pre-K programs and offices would open up additional space in the future.

1542
01:58:41,553 --> 01:58:45,615
If necessary, we can consider some redistricting to shift enrollment to the Columbus.

1543
01:58:46,135 --> 01:58:53,900
The allocation of specialized spaces for small groups and services could be revisited to create more sections or more options as well.

1544
01:58:54,620 --> 01:59:02,805
In conclusion, the data clearly indicates that the impact of major residential real estate development has not adversely impacted our schools.

1545
01:59:02,825 --> 01:59:04,887
So we're going to take you to the first chart.

1546
01:59:07,909 --> 01:59:11,591
You're looking at the eight big complexes.

1547
01:59:13,352 --> 01:59:17,735
If you look at them and you see the numbers of families in the first column,

1548
01:59:18,355 --> 01:59:22,796
So a family might have more than one kid, so that there would be less than the total number.

1549
01:59:23,176 --> 01:59:27,257
So if you have 16 number students in 100 Rivers Ed Drive, you only have 11 families.

1550
01:59:27,277 --> 01:59:29,577
Some families have more than one child.

1551
01:59:30,457 --> 01:59:32,138
And so on and so forth.

1552
01:59:32,158 --> 01:59:35,258
And some of these complexes have existed for some time.

1553
01:59:35,298 --> 01:59:36,019
They're not brand new.

1554
01:59:36,619 --> 01:59:37,499
They've been here for a while.

1555
01:59:38,679 --> 01:59:47,901
So when you look at it, you're looking at 105 students impacting us at this point in time, and two of them are outside placements, and the distribution's pretty good.

1556
01:59:48,967 --> 01:59:50,328
So let me go to the next chart for a minute.

1557
01:59:50,348 --> 01:59:52,849
Can I just say, is Lumiere less than 150 units?

1558
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:53,730
No.

1559
01:59:54,030 --> 01:59:55,551
So is Lumiere one of those addresses?

1560
01:59:55,571 --> 01:59:55,631
Yes.

1561
01:59:55,711 --> 01:59:57,032
I just don't know what the address is.

1562
01:59:57,132 --> 02:00:00,034
It's the third one, the 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1563
02:00:00,374 --> 02:00:00,735
Is Lumiere?

1564
02:00:00,755 --> 02:00:02,516
So there's nine students from Lumiere.

1565
02:00:02,776 --> 02:00:03,756
Okay, Lumiere.

1566
02:00:04,937 --> 02:00:08,720
All right, so you go to the next chart, and you look at grade level class sizes.

1567
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:13,323
All right, kindergarten, there are 16 teachers district wide, and the average class size is 18.4.

1568
02:00:13,363 --> 02:00:13,723
And grade one, 18.8.

1569
02:00:17,711 --> 02:00:18,271
In grade 2, 18.

1570
02:00:18,392 --> 02:00:19,793
In grade 3, 17.7.

1571
02:00:20,493 --> 02:00:22,575
In grade 4, 19.3.

1572
02:00:23,195 --> 02:00:23,896
In grade 5, 17.7.

1573
02:00:25,978 --> 02:00:28,900
Those class sizes are private school class sizes.

1574
02:00:30,121 --> 02:00:34,284
There are very few school districts in this area that have class sizes that good.

1575
02:00:35,645 --> 02:00:37,366
You've done an excellent job supporting that.

1576
02:00:38,207 --> 02:00:41,610
But anyone who tries to give you the impression that we're swamped and overcrowded,

1577
02:00:42,912 --> 02:00:44,333
is misleading everyone.

1578
02:00:44,634 --> 02:00:44,994
We're not.

1579
02:00:45,534 --> 02:00:48,657
Can we just go back to the buildings just because I don't know the addresses.

1580
02:00:48,857 --> 02:00:51,099
So 100 Rivers Edge Drive, where's that?

1581
02:00:51,419 --> 02:00:53,101
Rivers Edge is along the Malden River.

1582
02:00:53,121 --> 02:00:55,583
It runs from Wellington Station to Malden Station.

1583
02:00:55,743 --> 02:00:56,844
It's a new development.

1584
02:00:56,864 --> 02:00:59,607
They're commercial and residential.

1585
02:00:59,627 --> 02:00:59,887
OK.

1586
02:00:59,907 --> 02:01:00,968
3,600 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1587
02:01:01,008 --> 02:01:02,369
Is that behind the old Malden Mall?

1588
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:03,950
Yes.

1589
02:01:04,271 --> 02:01:04,411
OK.

1590
02:01:06,354 --> 02:01:08,895
in that 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway?

1591
02:01:08,915 --> 02:01:14,496
Those are the condos that are, those are directly behind, if you're on 16 looking at the mall to the right.

1592
02:01:15,296 --> 02:01:15,856
I'm pretty sure.

1593
02:01:16,116 --> 02:01:16,876
They're the condos.

1594
02:01:17,316 --> 02:01:17,676
Okay.

1595
02:01:18,377 --> 02:01:19,097
Cabot Road.

1596
02:01:19,677 --> 02:01:21,137
That's down Wellington Circle as well.

1597
02:01:21,177 --> 02:01:27,699
That's brand new, so this is just, it's probably, it's just beginning, it has its occupancy starting up.

1598
02:01:27,979 --> 02:01:28,299
Okay.

1599
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:31,860
And then the boat that's station landing, and then Riverside Ave.

1600
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:33,540
That's the towers at Riverside Ave.

1601
02:01:34,529 --> 02:01:35,649
Is that near?

1602
02:01:35,669 --> 02:01:36,510
They've been there forever.

1603
02:01:36,710 --> 02:01:38,750
Near La Conte Rink, is that?

1604
02:01:38,790 --> 02:01:39,631
They are, yes.

1605
02:01:39,791 --> 02:01:41,651
In 1979 they've been there since.

1606
02:01:41,771 --> 02:01:55,276
One of the things you need to think about about these things is that typically some young families might move in when they can afford, let's say, to live in a rental unit or a condo, as opposed to a full house at this point, given real estate prices.

1607
02:01:56,022 --> 02:01:57,825
But when their families grow, they move out.

1608
02:01:58,325 --> 02:01:59,667
They don't stay in these developments.

1609
02:01:59,707 --> 02:02:01,590
They move out to houses or they move elsewhere.

1610
02:02:02,191 --> 02:02:11,324
But we're gonna have to see what that does because basically, as housing prices in Medford go up, some young families are not gonna be able to afford to come in here as a starter home.

1611
02:02:12,846 --> 02:02:19,712
As far as buildings, what are the buildings, you know, when you go down 9th Street at the end, there's a new.

1612
02:02:20,412 --> 02:02:27,618
That's the one that, the five cabin is the brand new one that's having like a ribbon cutting in a week or so, but they have started their occupancy.

1613
02:02:28,199 --> 02:02:31,702
The one before the train tracks, they're under 150 units.

1614
02:02:32,242 --> 02:02:34,004
He looked at 150 as a threshold.

1615
02:02:34,204 --> 02:02:36,906
Okay, so all the condo buildings on 8th, 9th and 11th

1616
02:02:39,835 --> 02:02:42,977
all those buildings are not included in any of these lists.

1617
02:02:43,177 --> 02:02:45,879
Those are existing, those are existing, and they've been there for a while.

1618
02:02:46,139 --> 02:02:48,340
It's just that apartment complex at the very end.

1619
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:53,103
And the other thing you need to know, the other thing you need to know, look at the total distribution in the schools.

1620
02:02:54,344 --> 02:02:58,907
Even if I didn't include a building, your class sizes are still low.

1621
02:02:58,947 --> 02:03:03,710
Your numbers are still low, so that even if we added another building, it wouldn't have impacted it.

1622
02:03:04,058 --> 02:03:04,838
So could I?

1623
02:03:05,078 --> 02:03:08,580
Really, for a true comparison, you should be looking at the Rivers Edge Drive.

1624
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:09,920
That's brand new.

1625
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,962
It's apartments that are built, you know, they haven't been existing for a very long time.

1626
02:03:15,023 --> 02:03:16,923
And the station landing would be next up.

1627
02:03:17,283 --> 02:03:19,044
And they were put in in 2004.

1628
02:03:19,744 --> 02:03:22,646
But they were part of like transit development, smaller units.

1629
02:03:23,286 --> 02:03:28,148
So those are probably the ones I would be looking at, but comparable about going forward.

1630
02:03:28,388 --> 02:03:35,510
So I did request this report, and it's because of future building, and we have the baseline now that we know where we're at.

1631
02:03:36,390 --> 02:03:37,331
I have no problem with this.

1632
02:03:37,611 --> 02:03:45,253
The only data that's not on here that I would like from the census piece is how many of these people are, how many,

1633
02:03:46,203 --> 02:03:51,771
younger children, preschool age children, do they have that will be coming into our school district?

1634
02:03:51,811 --> 02:03:57,379
Because they're newer apartments, they might, right, and that is something you would get from the census, and I understand that.

1635
02:03:57,739 --> 02:04:01,825
And my only other concern is on the, I believe, third graph.

1636
02:04:02,775 --> 02:04:08,501
And where it says school development enrollment percentage, I just want to keep an eye on things.

1637
02:04:08,742 --> 02:04:18,012
And at the McGlynn, these new students, well, these new buildings affect 10%, almost 10%, 9.6% of their enrollment.

1638
02:04:18,332 --> 02:04:19,373
So we want to see.

1639
02:04:19,413 --> 02:04:20,394
Because of geography.

1640
02:04:20,634 --> 02:04:21,395
Right.

1641
02:04:21,535 --> 02:04:22,777
That's my whole point here.

1642
02:04:23,197 --> 02:04:24,679
If we're adding more.

1643
02:04:26,019 --> 02:04:28,943
apartments or condos in our community.

1644
02:04:29,203 --> 02:04:35,651
We need to see where in the community is and which schools it's going to impact and how we want to deal with that ahead.

1645
02:04:35,671 --> 02:04:37,573
We want to be proactive not reactive.

1646
02:04:38,034 --> 02:04:41,018
So like we just want to be careful with that and

1647
02:04:41,518 --> 02:04:55,480
maybe we redistrict any new building in this side, from this side over goes to this school, and this side over goes to this school, for future districting, not redistricting existing people.

1648
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:58,741
Then you get less people mad at you already that live here.

1649
02:04:59,761 --> 02:05:00,101
All right?

1650
02:05:00,381 --> 02:05:10,423
So that's why I asked for this report, is I wanna be proactive, not reactive in how we place students, and to make sure that no one school is crowded.

1651
02:05:11,083 --> 02:05:12,145
more crowded than others.

1652
02:05:13,206 --> 02:05:22,276
So this is good information, so I make a motion at this point to re-look at these numbers again at the end of the school year, so in June.

1653
02:05:23,498 --> 02:05:24,599
Perhaps in January.

1654
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:26,641
See if there's any changes.

1655
02:05:27,102 --> 02:05:28,764
This cabinet will be coming online.

1656
02:05:28,984 --> 02:05:30,566
Okay, so even, yeah.

1657
02:05:30,926 --> 02:05:31,347
So moved.

1658
02:05:32,425 --> 02:05:36,746
On the motion, this report be updated for the first meeting in January.

1659
02:05:37,707 --> 02:05:38,727
All those in favor?

1660
02:05:38,947 --> 02:05:39,447
Aye.

1661
02:05:39,587 --> 02:05:40,228
All those opposed?

1662
02:05:40,288 --> 02:05:41,088
Motion passes.

1663
02:05:41,768 --> 02:05:42,068
Thank you.

1664
02:05:42,108 --> 02:05:43,829
And that the report be placed on file.

1665
02:05:43,869 --> 02:05:44,549
All those in favor?

1666
02:05:44,569 --> 02:05:44,629
Aye.

1667
02:05:45,049 --> 02:05:46,350
All those opposed?

1668
02:05:46,370 --> 02:05:47,010
Motion passes.

1669
02:05:47,950 --> 02:05:50,131
Financial report close out of fiscal year 17.

1670
02:05:50,171 --> 02:05:50,211
Ms.

1671
02:05:50,371 --> 02:05:50,991
Patterson.

1672
02:05:51,011 --> 02:05:52,332
Here comes Kirsten.

1673
02:05:54,457 --> 02:05:55,959
Good evening.

1674
02:05:57,961 --> 02:06:09,174
So just as a preview, as a first year finance director, it was important to become familiar with Medford's chart of accounts, the budget categories, structurally, and payroll placements.

1675
02:06:09,614 --> 02:06:11,156
So this end of year report is a

1676
02:06:12,197 --> 02:06:30,628
High-level look by department and category for end of year fiscal 17 as the report indicates the appropriation budget Offered by the city side is the 54 million three hundred and thirty three thousand an additional 2.1

1677
02:06:32,469 --> 02:06:38,531
was identified from outside revenue sources as the overall budget totaling $56,443,392 for fiscal year 2017.

1678
02:06:38,591 --> 02:06:42,492
The year end finished with expenditures and remaining encumbrances totaling $55,686,555.

1679
02:06:42,552 --> 02:06:45,173
So the difference in this closeout was $1,458,616.

1680
02:06:45,313 --> 02:06:45,933
This was a $651,000

1681
02:07:02,218 --> 02:07:09,648
$776 less than projected to cover from additional revenue sources within the school departments.

1682
02:07:10,289 --> 02:07:18,279
The remaining revenue offset has already been earmarked and planned for balancing for the FY18 budget revenue sources as well.

1683
02:07:19,164 --> 02:07:20,285
So we didn't spend enough money?

1684
02:07:21,225 --> 02:07:21,866
Damn.

1685
02:07:23,067 --> 02:07:24,988
Nope, that's not what we're saying.

1686
02:07:25,948 --> 02:07:35,115
We were looking at, as we build the budget, it's a multi-year planning and analysis process.

1687
02:07:35,175 --> 02:07:41,599
So it's done late in the fiscal year so that we can attempt to project

1688
02:07:42,219 --> 02:07:57,545
where we are at in the current fiscal year and identify issues or concerns moving forward that we need to provide additional sources for, which we knew we were going to have some lower circuit breaker reimbursements in FY18.

1689
02:07:57,605 --> 02:08:00,166
We were going to have reduced grant funding.

1690
02:08:00,766 --> 02:08:03,229
And we have reduced homeless transportation reimbursement.

1691
02:08:03,249 --> 02:08:12,099
So all of these indicators made it necessary and prudent for us to be as conservative as possible.

1692
02:08:12,219 --> 02:08:16,464
So that 651,000 has been earmarked and planned for in the FY18 budget process.

1693
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:36,530
So moving forward, again, as high-level overviews, and again, these are programmatic savings in various line items.

1694
02:08:36,650 --> 02:08:40,092
So district-wide salaries, we budget for

1695
02:08:41,573 --> 02:08:44,755
a lump sum that is to be distributed and reallocated.

1696
02:08:44,855 --> 02:08:50,578
So again, being new within the district, it looks like there's funds remaining there.

1697
02:08:50,658 --> 02:08:58,462
However, they have already been dispersed among the appropriate accounts for step lane changes, things of that sort.

1698
02:08:59,662 --> 02:09:09,164
The district wide substitute account, we did realize some savings related to more automatic and accurate substitute call out.

1699
02:09:09,664 --> 02:09:20,487
The ASAP system was implemented and completed year one in fiscal year 2017, and it did realize some savings in that area.

1700
02:09:21,487 --> 02:09:42,183
The ELL department salaries, these were paid within school program codes, so although they had been budgeted in one department, they were, again, the matching up in terms of salaries was for the end of year reporting purposes and did not necessarily align with the budget line placement.

1701
02:09:42,663 --> 02:09:48,948
So again, just moving forward from my perspective, year one finance director,

1702
02:09:49,648 --> 02:09:56,333
it was necessary for me to identify and see where these were before making significant changes.

1703
02:09:56,433 --> 02:09:59,755
So we will be in that process moving forward for FY18.

1704
02:10:01,156 --> 02:10:10,483
Additionally, the similar situation in the guidance, the directors were paid within the district-wide program versus the guidance department.

1705
02:10:10,943 --> 02:10:17,307
And again, this is reporting distinctions for end of year report that did not align with the budget placement.

1706
02:10:18,908 --> 02:10:37,047
The English language arts salaries again paid within the school program codes and again this is just for the understanding of the end-of-year report the Department of Ed requires us to report by school so there is a need to to track this and be able to see and

1707
02:10:37,487 --> 02:10:43,409
the expenses for salaries in certain categories at a school-wide level.

1708
02:10:44,070 --> 02:10:53,253
So that's something to keep in mind as we do budget a program, those expenses still will have to be reported out at the end of year.

1709
02:10:53,393 --> 02:11:01,457
So there's still some alignment within our structure that just has to be translated to the end of year report.

1710
02:11:01,577 --> 02:11:04,518
So where it seems to be variances,

1711
02:11:05,199 --> 02:11:10,588
That's the rationale in terms of the actual placement of the expense.

1712
02:11:11,798 --> 02:11:15,700
Again, similar situation within the library department salaries.

1713
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:22,963
The director had been paid through district-wide program area versus the library departmental area.

1714
02:11:23,803 --> 02:11:37,009
The buildings and grounds, the utility usage for heating, which was natural gas, and our phone services did have some favorable contract rates and we did have lower utilization.

1715
02:11:38,450 --> 02:11:41,894
with the weather and things of that sort, so that was favorable.

1716
02:11:42,434 --> 02:11:54,306
That was, again, unpredictable year-to-year, so the budget reflects a need and anticipated heating year, and

1717
02:11:55,687 --> 02:12:02,773
due to certain situations in terms of building temperatures, things of that sort, it can fluctuate.

1718
02:12:03,694 --> 02:12:11,001
Hopefully we don't see a spike this year, but I don't know what the Farmer's Almanac will reveal.

1719
02:12:14,564 --> 02:12:23,491
Again, each year during our budget process, our revenue sources are identified as the supplement to the appropriated budget.

1720
02:12:24,292 --> 02:12:26,874
And that's a means to achieve the district goals.

1721
02:12:27,394 --> 02:12:34,520
So the amounts that we had utilized and identified from each source was dependent on program needs and the available balances.

1722
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:38,363
So as we close out and continue to reconcile the year end,

1723
02:12:38,903 --> 02:12:44,804
We will draw from the following accounts that we had identified during the FY17 budget development process.

1724
02:12:45,264 --> 02:12:54,886
And again, with foresight going into the FY18 process, those similar program areas were earmarked for revenue offsets.

1725
02:12:55,466 --> 02:13:03,648
And those areas include the before and after school programs, the MEAP, the SURE, and special ed tuitions that come in.

1726
02:13:04,368 --> 02:13:09,450
The circuit breaker, again, we've been notified that that reimbursement level has decreased.

1727
02:13:09,870 --> 02:13:20,915
We're down to about 65%, and that is a cost that cannot be managed or tracked year to year, dependent on student need.

1728
02:13:21,275 --> 02:13:31,300
So, transportation reimbursement, again, that continues to drop, and as we have fewer students

1729
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:52,602
Placed out of our district those those funds Begin to dwindle we did have vocational tuitions and we had e-rate reimbursement as well as our building facility rentals which included all of the schools our rank our pool the fields which we have reviewed extensively and

1730
02:13:53,162 --> 02:14:00,024
And again, continuous communication, working with the city hall, our auditor side, and treasury.

1731
02:14:00,444 --> 02:14:07,766
We will be determining final amounts from each of the sources and plan the application of those moving forward to FY18.

1732
02:14:08,326 --> 02:14:18,189
So as we go forward, moving along in this fiscal year, reports will be provided as we continue to do the finalization of closeouts.

1733
02:14:19,229 --> 02:14:20,810
Very good, thank you so much, Christine.

1734
02:14:21,230 --> 02:14:21,770
Mayor Berk.

1735
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:21,950
Ms.

1736
02:14:21,970 --> 02:14:22,310
Stone.

1737
02:14:23,216 --> 02:14:32,019
Kristine, just on the first page, the third paragraph, the last one, the undistributed unemployment, is that one employee or is that a number of employees?

1738
02:14:32,059 --> 02:14:34,240
No, multiple employees throughout the year.

1739
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:39,842
Okay, and is that, so it's 72,000, is that accurate?

1740
02:14:39,902 --> 02:14:41,962
Is that a typical year for unemployment?

1741
02:14:42,642 --> 02:14:45,503
That seems to be the average looking back, yes.

1742
02:14:46,244 --> 02:14:46,944
Yeah, wow.

1743
02:14:47,364 --> 02:14:49,345
And that's just the school department side.

1744
02:14:49,365 --> 02:14:49,585
Right, right.

1745
02:14:51,431 --> 02:14:51,551
Ms.

1746
02:14:51,571 --> 02:14:52,271
Vander Kloot.

1747
02:14:52,311 --> 02:14:57,454
Christine, I just want to thank you for your diligence in sorting out all of these accounts, and this is good news.

1748
02:14:58,354 --> 02:14:58,695
Thank you.

1749
02:14:58,995 --> 02:15:00,155
Thank you very much, Christine.

1750
02:15:00,355 --> 02:15:00,756
Thank you.

1751
02:15:01,796 --> 02:15:05,258
So at this point, if we could just entertain a quick little diversion.

1752
02:15:05,278 --> 02:15:13,862
I don't know how many of you realize, but over the course of the last week, we've been collecting sporting goods equipment to send down to the Houston area.

1753
02:15:14,842 --> 02:15:22,665
We realized how they were devastated and a lot of people were giving blood, donating money, and doing all sorts of things to help them out.

1754
02:15:23,385 --> 02:15:28,006
Our head baseball coach, Mike Nestor, came up with an idea and he said, why don't we do a drive?

1755
02:15:28,086 --> 02:15:29,367
These kids want to get back.

1756
02:15:30,407 --> 02:15:31,427
They have no equipment.

1757
02:15:31,507 --> 02:15:32,668
Everything's been just ruined.

1758
02:15:33,528 --> 02:15:35,349
So he wanted to start a drive for it.

1759
02:15:36,469 --> 02:15:42,513
Jack Dempsey has put together this awesome video that is on a truck right now rolling into Texas.

1760
02:15:43,313 --> 02:15:46,935
And it's just really spectacular how the community came together.

1761
02:15:46,955 --> 02:15:57,841
A lot of the sporting teams and the sporting equipment stores that supply our players with their equipment came through and put so many things on this truck.

1762
02:15:58,242 --> 02:15:59,382
It's just simply amazing.

1763
02:15:59,482 --> 02:16:05,746
So without further ado, I hope you all enjoy this video that Jack and the team put together with all the kids at the high school.

1764
02:16:15,742 --> 02:16:18,524
Harvey, you have a problem.

1765
02:16:18,624 --> 02:16:19,205
The Mustangs!

1766
02:16:39,566 --> 02:16:41,427
Mustangs win together!

1767
02:16:41,727 --> 02:16:44,369
One, two, three, Mustangs!

1768
02:16:44,409 --> 02:16:46,410
Hello, my name is Stephanie Muccini-Burke.

1769
02:16:46,470 --> 02:16:50,113
I'm the mayor of Medford, Mass., home of the mighty Medford Mustangs.

1770
02:16:50,533 --> 02:16:55,256
They say up here in Medford country that our veins bleed blue and white, and we know you're the same.

1771
02:16:55,756 --> 02:16:58,398
We're here to support you in rebuilding your community.

1772
02:16:58,618 --> 02:17:03,001
I'm here with our athletic director, Bobby Maloney, and our head baseball coach, Mike Nestor.

1773
02:17:03,361 --> 02:17:04,822
Bobby, would you like to say a few words?

1774
02:17:05,242 --> 02:17:09,003
Yeah, Barry Campbell, from one Mustang to another, we're coming with some help.

1775
02:17:10,164 --> 02:17:16,266
The citizens in the school department are going to step up, and you're going to get a nice truckload from Local 25 headed your way.

1776
02:17:16,886 --> 02:17:17,286
Good luck.

1777
02:17:17,506 --> 02:17:20,527
Keep us in touch, and thoughts and prayers are with the entire community.

1778
02:17:22,368 --> 02:17:22,728
Michael.

1779
02:17:23,008 --> 02:17:24,808

Alright, Mustang to Mustangs.

1793
02:18:03,386 --> 02:18:21,129
This is Coach Joe Donglin of the Memphis High School, Mustangs, letting you guys know that we are one track family and we're here for you.

1794

Once a Mustang, always a Mustang.

1797

Go Mustangs!

1798
02:18:31,242 --> 02:18:31,643
Hello.

1799
02:18:32,704 --> 02:18:36,586
The Mustang way is that we take care of our own and we support each other at all times.

1800
02:18:37,547 --> 02:18:39,809
We're with you every gallop of the way.

1801
02:18:39,829 --> 02:18:44,732
From our Mustang Seors, keep on galloping!

1802
02:18:47,678 --> 02:18:48,978
Go Mustangs!

1803
02:18:49,279 --> 02:18:51,519
We support the Kingman Mustangs.

1804
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:52,700
Woo!

1805
02:18:52,940 --> 02:18:54,580
Go Mustangs!

1806
02:18:55,161 --> 02:18:59,962
I want to first pass along my best wishes for your recovery efforts down there in Houston.

1807
02:19:00,382 --> 02:19:01,203
Go Mustangs.

1808
02:19:01,303 --> 02:19:04,204
Go Mustangs!

1809
02:19:20,196 --> 02:19:21,657

Go Mustangs!

1812
02:19:25,098 --> 02:19:26,559
Go Mustangs, baby, let's go!

1813
02:19:27,720 --> 02:19:28,540
Go Mustangs!

1814
02:19:28,820 --> 02:19:29,520
Go Mustangs!

1815
02:19:30,221 --> 02:19:34,283
Bedford Mustangs are here to support the Kingswood Mustangs.

1816
02:19:34,503 --> 02:19:37,524
Us Mustangs stick together, hang in there through the good and bad.

1817
02:19:37,624 --> 02:19:38,645
We're with you.

1818
02:19:38,665 --> 02:19:39,265
We're gonna fight!

Mustangs, we got your back.

1823
02:19:48,009 --> 02:19:49,210
Go Mustangs!

1824
02:19:50,368 --> 02:19:51,509
Mustangs support Mustangs.

1825
02:19:51,649 --> 02:19:52,130
Hang in there.

1826
02:19:52,490 --> 02:19:53,471
Hi Kingwood High School.

1827
02:19:53,851 --> 02:19:55,012
My name is Jason Nascimento.

1828
02:19:55,052 --> 02:19:57,334
I'm the head football coach here at Medford High School.

1829
02:19:58,415 --> 02:20:03,579
And all the Medford Mustangs here want to wish all of our well-wishers to support you guys.

1830
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:09,024
Go Mustangs!

1831
02:20:09,044 --> 02:20:10,846
We, Mustangs, are with you.

1832
02:20:18,229 --> 02:20:20,690
From our Mustangs to yours, keep pushing forward.

1833
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:21,330
It gets better.

1834
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:22,130
You've got this.

1835
02:20:22,650 --> 02:20:24,410
Go Mustangs!

1836
02:20:24,450 --> 02:20:25,030
Go Mustangs!

1837
02:20:25,050 --> 02:20:25,530
