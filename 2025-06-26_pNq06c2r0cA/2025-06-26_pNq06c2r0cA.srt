[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that the applicant is present.

100
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:37,614

114
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:06,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I'll post it in the chat.

115
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:08,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, awesome.

116
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:12,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we ready?

117
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:13,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we are ready.

118
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:18,098

119
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:23,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, I think I'll cede the floor to Attorney Dash.

120
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:26,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And feel free to begin your introductions and presentation.

121
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:28,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, can I interrupt for one minute?

122
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:29,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

123
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:34,049
[SPEAKER_10]: This is related to my background conversation that I was just having.

124
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:46,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, do you want to, you need to state your connection and whether or not you have any financial interest.

125
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:47,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

126
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I am an engineer at Niche in a completely different group who is the engineer for this project.

127
00:07:55,894 --> 00:08:02,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have no financial interest and can be objective in the discussion of this project.

128
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,921
[SPEAKER_10]: But we wanted to disclose that before we started.

129
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:12,425
[SPEAKER_10]: If anybody had any concerns about that, sorry, we didn't realize beforehand that there was any connection.

130
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:16,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Great to put it on the record, thank you.

131
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:21,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.

00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the new members as well.

133
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:24,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to see you all.

134
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:30,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney Adam Dash, 48 Grove Street, Davis Square, Somerville, representing the trustees of Tufts College.

135
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:45,288
[SPEAKER_06]: With me who will be involved are Ruth Bennett, the Senior Director for Capital Programs for Tufts, Rocco DiRico, the Executive Director of Government Community Relations for Tufts, Anthony Petrocci, the Senior Project Manager for the Capital Programs at Tufts,

136
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:53,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Gabriel, Senior Project Manager for Niche Engineering, who are the civil engineers, and Lynn Denninger from Canon Design, the architect.

137
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:58,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe she's having a little trouble getting in, but she's here really to answer questions, not to present anyway.

138
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:07,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will share screen and show you a slide, if I can get it to show up here.

139
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:10,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

140
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:16,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you see the screen?

141
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:18,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

142
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:19,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic.

143
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:20,217
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

144
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:22,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see if I can go full screen mode.

145
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:27,186
[SPEAKER_06]: You see that?

146
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:28,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

147
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

148
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:29,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

149
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:29,989
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

150
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:37,922
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about Bacon Hall, which is known as 530 Boston Avenue, as you heard from the recitation of addresses.

151
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:49,531
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you've heard from various projects that we brought before you from Tufts, the addresses and the lots are kind of more of an intellectual exercise than a reality, because this is all part of the Tufts University campus.

152
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:55,956
[SPEAKER_06]: However, some parcels like this have certain meets and bounds in the deeds, and that's what we're using to calculate things.

153
00:09:55,996 --> 00:10:00,440
[SPEAKER_06]: But just keep in mind that this is all on one campus, even though there are multiple addresses involved.

154
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,787
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the project location in red.

155
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:11,835
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see Boston Avenue, I'm moving my cursor, Boston Avenue in front, the railroad in the back.

156
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:14,497
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see here's Dearborn Road.

157
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:18,321
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this is College Avenue that intersects up here.

158
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:23,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is Tufts properties on both sides of the property.

159
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:44,575
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so this is an application for a site plan review of a Dover amendment use under section 11.8.3 of the Medford Zoning Ordinance to construct a single story with a basement in fill addition at Bacon Hall at 530 Boston Avenue along with a gut renovation inside and cosmetic improvements outside that I will show you shortly.

160
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:50,780
[SPEAKER_06]: This is similar in nature, you may recall, to the Eaton Hall project that we got approval from you last month on.

161
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:55,764
[SPEAKER_06]: The academic use of Bacon Hall will not change.

162
00:10:56,624 --> 00:11:07,850
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition, Tufts University will be running utilities to Bacon Hall and locating a transformer, electrical switchgear, and relocating the existing emergency generator from the roof of Bacon Hall, where it is now.

163
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:15,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And all that will be on the property to the right over here at 550 Boston Avenue, which is next door.

164
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, also part of the Tufts campus.

165
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:18,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Now get into that just a little more.

166
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:19,584
[SPEAKER_06]: later.

167
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:27,178
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also going to be an Argonne tank and an egress that are going to be added partly on 530 and partly on 550, but it's all the same kind of thing.

168
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:31,618
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the existing conditions that you can see.

169
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:37,120
[SPEAKER_06]: The building here, this is Bacon Hall.

170
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as you can see, there's sort of like an inlet where there's parking.

171
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:41,742
[SPEAKER_06]: This is looking from Boston Ave.

172
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:42,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's the building.

173
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:46,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there's sort of a cutout where there's the building, and then there's more building over here.

174
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:51,307
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea is to do this infill in this cutout area where there's parking and a dumpster.

175
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:54,709
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the other sides of the building, not terribly interesting.

176
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:57,030
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the railroad side, which you're not going to see.

177
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:08,023
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea then, so the idea, so the, let's see, so this is the existing condition.

178
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:14,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So the infill's gonna remove six parking spaces in the front of the property.

179
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,650
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that they're here now at 530.

180
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:22,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you can see also there's currently really no landscaping along where that infill's gonna go.

181
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,057
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a big open sea of concrete.

182
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,387
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the proposed view from Boston Avenue.

183
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:31,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see, there's the one-story infill addition I was talking about.

184
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,732
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the existing building, although it's modernized.

185
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:37,054
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the existing building that's modernized.

186
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:39,256
[SPEAKER_06]: And the back is still that existing building.

187
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:43,519
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is the part that was punched in, that had parking and a dumpster and all that.

188
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:45,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see now it's greenery and building.

189
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:47,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, again, a single-story addition.

190
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:49,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's an equal-sized basement below it.

191
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:56,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see, it's also still set back from Boston Avenue, more than the existing building is.

192
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:01,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we've done some landscaping here to beautify the streetscape.

193
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:09,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is another view that gives you a better idea of what we're doing here, how it's punched in and how this is the infill area here.

194
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:14,592
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see the access and all that sort of thing.

195
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:17,654
[SPEAKER_06]: The building exterior is gonna be updated and modernized.

196
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:19,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sort of a very 1980s look right now.

197
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:28,983
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see, the emergency generator is no longer up here on the roof of Bacon Hall, because it's being moved over here to the right, that I will show you right now.

198
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:30,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the site plan.

199
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:35,180
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got here, this is 530, here's Boston Ave at the bottom, railroads at the top.

200
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:45,387
[SPEAKER_06]: This is 530 Boston Ave, and you can see this square here, this white rectangle rather says addition, is that infill addition that we're doing where the parking and dumpster are now.

201
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:48,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this is the landscaping that goes in front.

202
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:58,696
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see, this is the, the building will continue to be used, as I said, for academic purposes with areas for teaching, research, labs, and classrooms.

203
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:03,329
[SPEAKER_06]: The addition is only 1,665 square feet on the first floor.

204
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,814
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also an equal size basement that's used only for storage.

205
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:12,302
[SPEAKER_06]: This infill addition is much smaller than the infill addition that you approved last month for Eaton Hall.

206
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:21,071
[SPEAKER_06]: which was a 3,595-foot two-story addition, whereas this is this 1,665-foot single-story addition.

207
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:26,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So to the right here, this is 550, and again, 530, you know, just for address purposes.

208
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:34,579
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see here that there's going to be a new transformer, switchgear, and a generator, and all this is going to be in an enclosure.

209
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:36,829
[SPEAKER_06]: with privacy screen and fencing.

210
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:42,274
[SPEAKER_06]: The generator has its own built-in sound attenuation.

211
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:46,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So the screening here is visual.

212
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:49,001
[SPEAKER_06]: This takes out five parking spaces you can see here as well.

213
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:52,003
[SPEAKER_06]: for that equipment.

214
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:59,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, the transformer is currently on the roof and is coming over here, which actually brings it further away from the houses and closer to the train tracks.

215
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:06,372
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can also see in this location, this is where this argon tank is going to go for use in the building.

216
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:14,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say if my high school chemistry education still holds that argon is a noble gas, which is inert and is used for purposes in the lab.

217
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:21,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this is, of course, over here is this is one of the egresses out from the building.

218
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:28,296
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tufts is proposing to add also a note here, a new crosswalk.

219
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:29,918
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the building.

220
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, this is the same view you saw before.

221
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's Bacon Hall.

222
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, there is a crosswalk at Harvard Street and Boston Ave.

223
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:42,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is currently a crosswalk at College Avenue and Boston Ave.

224
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:51,793
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're going to be doing is adding a new curb cut from Dearborn across Boston Avenue to create a mid-strip third crossing.

225
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:57,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And these blue lines are how someone in a wheelchair from various locations would access Bacon Hall.

226
00:15:58,718 --> 00:16:10,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to point out that there are currently and will remain these four accessible parking spaces, which are in close proximity to Bacon Hall, also on the Tufts property in the existing parking lot at 550.

227
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:25,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there will be an accessible ramp, there's currently an accessible ramp at Dearborn and Boston Avenue, because there's a crosswalk that crosses Dearborn right now on the other side of the street.

228
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:34,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And so using that existing handicapped or accessible ramp at the intersection of Dearborn, that's the place we'd like to make the crossing.

229
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:41,584
[SPEAKER_06]: over to our side, where the Bacon Hall is, because that is a safer location to do this.

230
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:47,149
[SPEAKER_06]: So the feeling is that these three crossings will serve the needs of the Bacon Hall project.

231
00:16:50,816 --> 00:17:07,896
[SPEAKER_06]: The parking for Tufts employees at the Bacon Hall is who the parking is for the parking is for the employees, and that at Bacon Hall and 550 Boston Ave as I said we're taking out the parking spaces currently in the infill area in front of Bacon Hall as well as the ones on 550 where the generator and such are going.

232
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:20,859
[SPEAKER_06]: that those employees will be accommodated by Tufts in their other existing parking lots and garages, which have excess capacity, especially since more employees now work remotely and the new Green Line stations have opened.

233
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:29,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not as if, while there will be five to eight more employees at Bacon Hall as a result of this project, they're not new Tufts employees.

234
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:38,163
[SPEAKER_06]: They're being relocated from other places on campus and put here to accommodate the academic purpose that we will explain a little more detail later.

235
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:47,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, students don't drive from classroom to classroom, so this was never really for student parking anyway, this is for staff.

236
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:56,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, Tufts has the unique opportunity to sort of tell people where to park on campus, and so we will be able to put staff in the proper locations.

237
00:17:57,072 --> 00:18:03,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So there will be no real parking or traffic changes due to the project, although we are obviously moving some things around.

238
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:17,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to be clear that the initially filed plans, because I thought there might have been some confusion, that the original five plans were revised on July 10th to add a new utility plan to change the utility access.

239
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,793
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were showing some running from the left.

240
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:36,907
[SPEAKER_06]: side over here to the building and now as you can see, because here's 530 Boston Ave and here's 550 Boston Ave and you can see here's where the transformers and the electrical switchgear and the generator are all going and how they'd be accessing Bacon Hall.

241
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:41,648
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are not coming from the other side now.

242
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:52,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Tufts is not going to be as a result digging up the sidewalk to the left of Bacon Hall and I would like Mark Gabriel from niche to actually explain this a little better because he's the engineer, Mark.

243
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:53,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Adam thanks for that appreciate it.

244
00:18:54,358 --> 00:19:00,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just first of all Mark Gabriel niche engineering and senior project manager there in the civil planning and resilience department.

245
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:02,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure everybody can hear me okay.

246
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:05,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

247
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:19,230
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, as Mr. dash was just saying the, the original plans that were submitted as part of this application showed, if you will, left of this plan or north of the building.

248
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,813
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a proposed routing of thermal utilities from what is known as

249
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:28,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray Hall to the facilities building to the south.

250
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:35,759
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a short trench of excavation, but that work is no longer part of the project.

251
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:42,482
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been able to find that the existing utilities can service the building without having to be removed and replaced.

252
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:44,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's been removed as part of the project.

253
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:46,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Mark.

254
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to make sure everybody's on the same page.

255
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:51,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the original application plans have been changed to this.

256
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:52,528
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, great.

257
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:52,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

258
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,745
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're curious about the project schedule.

259
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:56,525
[SPEAKER_06]: This is it.

260
00:19:57,926 --> 00:20:01,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a note that Tufts held a neighborhood meeting on this project on April 26.

261
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:05,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have done that I want to go back to here.

262
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:11,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So as this board knows the Dover member projects such as this are limited to two increase one.

263
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:13,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a Dover protected use?

264
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:15,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously an academic building clearly is.

265
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:20,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, what reasonable regulations to certain things should be imposed?

266
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:26,791
[SPEAKER_06]: The existing dimensional measurements of this project will not be made worse except the existing nonconforming

267
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:29,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Maximum lot cover will be increased.

268
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:31,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that was because we're doing the infill.

269
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:35,130
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was the same with Eaton Hall, which was approved last month.

270
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:45,778
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also, as I said before, more of an intellectual exercise as to how much the lot, quote unquote, is and where the borders are because everything in the campus sort of bleeds into each other.

271
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:54,885
[SPEAKER_06]: But being technical about it, technically speaking, taking the 530 Boston Avenue lot as a separate lot, we would be increasing the maximum lot cover.

272
00:20:55,565 --> 00:21:04,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And the one required loading dock is not being provided because it is not necessary for our academic purpose for this building, although the zoning does require it here.

273
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:09,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Ruth, I'd like for the academic purpose, I'd like to have Ruth Bennett explain this.

274
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:14,590
[SPEAKER_06]: She can do it better than I as to an exciting academic purpose that this building is being put towards.

275
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Ruth?

276
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:16,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, great.

277
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

278
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Ruthie Bennett, senior director of capital programs.

279
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:28,329
[SPEAKER_08]: So Bacon Hall actually is part of an area of campus that includes another building across the street, Bromfield Pearson.

280
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:35,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And this area is becoming the locus for our climate change and adaptation studies.

281
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,877
[SPEAKER_08]: So Tufts is creating a climate institute

282
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:46,039
[SPEAKER_08]: between these two buildings, Bacon Hall and Bromfield Pearson, the Office of Sustainability is moving into Bromfield Pearson.

283
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:57,008
[SPEAKER_08]: And really this area is gonna start having many of the faculty who focus on not only studying climate change, but adaptation and energy transition technologies.

284
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:03,154
[SPEAKER_08]: So this building is the second part of a renovation for this area of campus.

285
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:04,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So really excited about it,

286
00:22:05,268 --> 00:22:13,283
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that, you know, for the city of Medford, but also to Tufts, it's really critical that we start understanding how to adapt and how to do the energy transition we need to do.

287
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:15,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

288
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:16,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Ruth.

289
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:36,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So, therefore, the applicant requests that the board approve the site plan review of this modest over amendment project, which will remove the existing front yard parking, provide a nicer looking building and landscaping to improve the streetscape provide one new crosswalk at Dearborn across Boston Avenue in addition to the two existing crosswalks.

290
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:46,853
[SPEAKER_06]: will make Bacon Hall ADA accessible and more energy efficient, and will allow Tufts University to expand its climate studies work to help save the world.

291
00:22:47,213 --> 00:22:48,654
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much.

292
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:52,736
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have other folks here as well to answer any questions that the board may have.

293
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:58,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, Attorney Dash, for the presentation.

294
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:04,482
[SPEAKER_12]: I am going to open it up for public comment at this time.

295
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:16,893
[SPEAKER_12]: And oh, actually, before we go to public comment, I'm going to open it up to the city staff if there's anything that you want to add.

296
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, just a quick request.

297
00:23:18,294 --> 00:23:26,776
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if for the sake of just conversation for now, if we could stop sharing screen to see people, would that be okay with folks?

298
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:33,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

299
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:46,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't sure if, so a little behind the scenes chatter just to keep things, just to make sure that procedurally we're all in check.

300
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:53,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure if, Peter, did you want to stay on deliberations or were you?

301
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:57,104
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was looking to recuse for this item.

302
00:23:57,945 --> 00:23:58,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

303
00:23:59,286 --> 00:23:59,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

304
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:00,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Peter.

305
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't believe we have any additional staff comments at this time.

306
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:20,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially we, um, you know, there were some comments from engineering and traffic that PDS also was in agreement with about, um, the inclusion of crosswalks, and we did meet with the applicant earlier this week.

307
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they addressed, uh, you know, they provided a proposed proposal with one crosswalk, um,

308
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,406
[SPEAKER_01]: which we feel sort of is definitely getting us there.

309
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:37,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think otherwise we felt other comments were addressed.

310
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:44,300
[SPEAKER_12]: So as of now, all of the city staff comments have been addressed, including the fire department.

311
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:56,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and I believe the fire department comments, we put a, we were provided a memo by the applicant team addressing each one of those.

312
00:24:57,006 --> 00:25:06,855
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say that in speaking with the city engineer, he did want to make clear to the board that, you know, he maintains his recommendation about two crosswalks as opposed to one.

313
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:09,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it's at the board's discretion.

314
00:25:12,748 --> 00:25:20,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I can state just Adam dash again, that the reason why we're not doing a second crosswalk is a it's not needed for the bacon hall project.

315
00:25:21,592 --> 00:25:31,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And we didn't feel that being a Dover amendment matter that having sort of city infrastructure improvements done which were not related to the project really wasn't part of the Dover analysis.

316
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:33,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, the crosswalk.

317
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:36,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the slide anymore but they were talking about one over at St.

318
00:25:36,358 --> 00:25:37,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Clements road.

319
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:45,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And the feeling was that that would not be a safe crossing due to the fact you have this weird triangular intersection of Boston Avenue and St.

320
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:45,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Clement's.

321
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:51,288
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you cross the street, you basically end up into the parking lot of Semolina's, which really wasn't the place where you wanted to be.

322
00:25:51,888 --> 00:26:04,854
[SPEAKER_06]: So it felt as though since there were already two crosswalks at either end of the strip and putting one sort of by Bacon Hall in the middle at Dearborn, where there's already a handicapped ramp at that corner, that that sort of created a midpoint

323
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:08,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you, and I don't know, I can pull up the screen again, but I don't, you saw it.

324
00:26:08,422 --> 00:26:16,385
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you look at every, all the houses and all the people and all the campus, everyone's pretty close to one of those three crosswalks, one way or the other.

325
00:26:16,905 --> 00:26:22,447
[SPEAKER_06]: And that the second one's kind of just not necessary and not particularly well, easily located on that strip.

326
00:26:22,487 --> 00:26:23,707
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was our thought.

327
00:26:26,898 --> 00:26:37,914
[SPEAKER_12]: And with the absence of the city engineer, I'm not exactly sure outside of those recommendations, what the board would be able to deliberate on based on the fact that this is covered under the Dover amendment.

328
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:43,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia, did you want to weigh in on anything before opening it up to the public?

329
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,081
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we met with TOPS about it.

330
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:49,842
[SPEAKER_10]: We had talked with some of the details.

331
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:53,564
[SPEAKER_10]: We do like having this mid-block crosswalk.

332
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:57,007
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is a pretty simple, straightforward project.

333
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:03,531
[SPEAKER_10]: They tried to butter me up by pointing out that they were going to have climate scientists working in this building.

334
00:27:05,012 --> 00:27:09,014
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a reasonably good project.

335
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:10,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Ouch.

336
00:27:13,475 --> 00:27:15,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Just teasing, just teasing.

337
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:23,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Ruthie and I worked together in other previously on energy before she ever worked at the city at Tufts University.

338
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:35,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Does the board want, I'm going to open it up now to see if the board has any clarifying questions before I open it up to the public.

339
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:39,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anyone from the board have any clarifying questions?

340
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:39,691
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.

341
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:41,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, go ahead.

342
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:47,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think this crosswalk has kind of peaked, maybe a few people's interest.

343
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:59,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Because this is an over amendment project, would we as the board even be able to request the addition of a crosswalk or is that beyond the scope of what we're able to do today.

344
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:06,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's Adam dash can I have a note for the applicants position is that the.

345
00:28:07,197 --> 00:28:13,062
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dover amendment allows you a parking regulation, it doesn't end height massing and that sort of thing of the building.

346
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:20,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I does not mention anything about doing you know city infrastructure improvements for really, it's this crosswalk across the city street.

347
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,851
[SPEAKER_06]: We're obviously willing to do it.

348
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:28,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a discussion that we had earlier this week as Amanda said with the city to work something out.

349
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:36,058
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps everybody at the end of the day, and there's already a handicap ramp there at that corner, so the Dearborn makes some sense.

350
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:49,265
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as this building project doesn't need two crosswalks, and I don't think Dover really allows that to be one of the things that can be conditioned, but we're willing to do the one.

351
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:51,285
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we're willing to do the one.

352
00:28:51,305 --> 00:28:53,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't, there's just no purpose to the second one.

353
00:28:54,346 --> 00:29:02,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand maybe Medford wants a second one, but that really has nothing to do with the Bacon Hill Hall project and what it needs to get people there.

354
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:05,050
[SPEAKER_06]: So we felt that that was not something that we would do.

355
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:11,672
[SPEAKER_06]: But the one crosswalk where we're, I don't think we even have to do that, but obviously we're willing to do that because it makes some sense.

356
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:24,671
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear that what I'm hearing is that the one crosswalk is a courtesy and we do not have the authority to to require a second one.

357
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:25,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Does the city concur with that?

358
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:37,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, yeah, I think that generally... We're not talking about something that we can't even influence.

359
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:40,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, you know... Yeah.

360
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,402
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're sort of at that point.

361
00:29:42,422 --> 00:29:43,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's fine.

362
00:29:44,876 --> 00:30:05,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I also just this is rocket very good I'm sorry, director of government community relations at Tufts and 14 cavemen street in Medford, just add to the one crosswalk that we are proposing connects Tufts property to Tufts property so that's why we feel, you know, we're happy to do that, it's going above and beyond the usual scope of a project.

363
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,483
[SPEAKER_00]: The other crosswalk that was connected would not connect on the other end to Tufts property.

364
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,604
[SPEAKER_00]: It's connecting to St.

365
00:30:11,664 --> 00:30:13,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Clements, which is another institution.

366
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:25,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feel we're connecting a crosswalk that will, as Ruth mentioned, connect the Earth and Climate Science Institute with our other institutions.

367
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:29,136
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expect the flow of pedestrian traffic to use that one crosswalk.

368
00:30:31,017 --> 00:30:31,057
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

369
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:33,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys for answering that question.

370
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:33,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate it.

371
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:35,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have any other questions, Jackie.

372
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

373
00:30:37,118 --> 00:30:40,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Does any of the board members have other questions?

374
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Hearing none, I'm going to open it up to the public.

375
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:57,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments.

376
00:30:57,202 --> 00:31:01,825
[SPEAKER_12]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

377
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:05,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

378
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:12,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Remind all meeting participants to refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

379
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:19,218
[SPEAKER_12]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert the chair and staff.

380
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:27,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters if you do not?

381
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,470
[SPEAKER_12]: see anything.

382
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:30,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

383
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:36,395
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I haven't, we haven't received any letters or comments ahead of the meeting.

384
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:47,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to refresh our inbox just in case now, and I am not seeing any raised hands in the audience or the participant list.

385
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:52,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let me admit Lynn, but I think she's part of the applicant team.

386
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:53,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Lynn's our architect.

387
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:59,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and yep, seeing no new comments in the email inbox.

388
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:04,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

389
00:32:06,985 --> 00:32:15,092
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will close the public comment period at this time, seeing that there's no public comments, and I will bring it back to the board for deliberation on this.

390
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:24,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anyone have any of the board members have anything that they want to add to speak as far as the decision on this?

391
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:30,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Jackie.

392
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I check?

393
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:33,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, of course.

394
00:32:34,423 --> 00:32:35,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful presentation, as always.

395
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:40,788
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like the presentations that your team puts out should be the gold standard for future applicants.

396
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:43,830
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very supportive of this project.

397
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:54,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Working in renewable energy myself, I'm really excited to hear that Tufts is embarking on this type of work, and I have no negative comments.

398
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I look forward to supporting it.

399
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:10,005
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will close the deliberations by actually echoing what Emily has said.

400
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:12,447
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate your detailed presentation.

401
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:22,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Attorney Dash, I appreciate your stance on reminding the city and the board exactly what is limited within the Dover Amendment.

402
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:28,560
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe that we have covered all of the items that we needed to.

403
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,122
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to ask for a motion to approve

404
00:33:32,063 --> 00:33:33,843
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, Jackie, to the chair.

405
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:53,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had more of like a, just a question of interest to the applicant, which was, I wondered if, is the applicant pursuing any, just as a climate and resiliency center, is the applicant pursuing the use of solar at all for this structure?

406
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:56,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll answer that.

407
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,330
[SPEAKER_08]: So we actually have looked at

408
00:33:58,743 --> 00:34:02,826
[SPEAKER_08]: solar on all of our buildings on the Medford-Somerville campus.

409
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:11,671
[SPEAKER_08]: We've probably put 80%, we've covered 80% of the roofs that don't have limitations because of roof equipment.

410
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:18,956
[SPEAKER_08]: So part of the challenge is that this roof isn't big enough with all the equipment that's already on there to make it useful.

411
00:34:20,497 --> 00:34:22,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Viable, right, sorry, not useful, viable.

412
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:23,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, we have a third party.

413
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:24,279
[SPEAKER_08]: We work with power options.

414
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:26,701
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a third party who sort of puts the panels on there.

415
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:28,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there isn't enough generation,

416
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:30,930
[SPEAKER_08]: it doesn't become viable for them.

417
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,031
[SPEAKER_08]: So this project doesn't have it.

418
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:36,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say, like I said, we've covered 80% of our roofs.

419
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:40,674
[SPEAKER_08]: We have two or three more projects that we're working on to put solar on.

420
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:44,656
[SPEAKER_08]: So not in this project, but yes, two or three more that we're trying to finalize.

421
00:34:46,077 --> 00:34:46,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

422
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:48,258
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

423
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:58,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure that we can impose any kind of conditions going forward.

424
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:05,552
[SPEAKER_12]: The proponent has done a detailed presentation, which I believe covers everything in the scope of the Dover amendment.

425
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:20,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And as has been said, providing one cross work as a courtesy, I'm not comfortable myself as just one board member imposing any other conditions before recommending that the site plan be

426
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:24,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

427
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:26,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Accepted as is.

428
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:40,883
[SPEAKER_12]: And in saying that, I would say if any board members wanted to make a motion to accept the site plan, the Dover use of the site plan for the 550 Boston Ave.

429
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:42,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to make a motion.

430
00:35:43,484 --> 00:35:44,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a second?

431
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:46,005
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to second.

432
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:49,407
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to do roll call.

433
00:35:50,287 --> 00:35:51,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Emily Hederman?

434
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:51,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

435
00:35:54,004 --> 00:35:55,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Peter.

436
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:59,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I just lost my screen.

437
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:01,406
[SPEAKER_12]: One second.

438
00:36:02,706 --> 00:36:04,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize, I'm just trying to see who's here.

439
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:08,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you Fishman?

440
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:09,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

441
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Pam Marionski?

442
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:11,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

443
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:13,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Sally Akiki?

444
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:14,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

445
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:17,210
[SPEAKER_12]: And myself, Jackie McPherson is a yes.

446
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:23,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, Attorney Dash, Rocco, and all others that have done your presentation.

447
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:24,374
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate it.

448
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:27,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and good to see you all.

449
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:28,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

450
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:31,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great evening.

451
00:36:32,342 --> 00:36:32,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

452
00:36:44,854 --> 00:36:46,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we're going to come to board elections.

453
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, before we do board elections, Amanda, would it be.

454
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:54,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Should we vote on the meeting minutes from 517 1st?

455
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:59,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I can just get it out of the way the approval of minutes.

456
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Peter, have you rejoined us?

457
00:37:05,502 --> 00:37:07,984
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I'm having technical difficulties.

458
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:08,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm here.

459
00:37:08,504 --> 00:37:08,904
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm back.

460
00:37:09,485 --> 00:37:09,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

461
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:16,309
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to see if anyone wants to make a motion to approve the meet and minutes from 5-17-23.

462
00:37:22,213 --> 00:37:22,873
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll make a motion.

463
00:37:22,894 --> 00:37:24,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, second.

464
00:37:26,456 --> 00:37:26,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

465
00:37:26,736 --> 00:37:29,498
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I do have a clarifying question before we go forward.

466
00:37:29,598 --> 00:37:30,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Amanda, are we...

467
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

468
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:39,123
[SPEAKER_12]: We have board members that were not present at the time of will they will their vote carry?

469
00:37:39,643 --> 00:37:39,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

470
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:40,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

471
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,264
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strange in concept.

472
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:49,769
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, member who hasn't been at the meeting minutes in question is allowed to vote on those minutes.

473
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:51,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, awesome.

474
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,111
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got one motion that I get a second.

475
00:37:54,131 --> 00:37:57,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, from, uh, from me.

476
00:37:58,473 --> 00:37:58,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

477
00:37:58,614 --> 00:37:59,294
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're gonna do a roll

478
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:03,779
[SPEAKER_04]: here.

479
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

480
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:04,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

481
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot what you're all telling me.

482
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:07,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you Fishman?

483
00:38:08,504 --> 00:38:08,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

484
00:38:09,385 --> 00:38:10,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Pam Mariansky?

485
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:10,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

486
00:38:11,508 --> 00:38:12,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Sally Akiki?

487
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:13,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

488
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,751
[SPEAKER_12]: And Jackie McPherson?

489
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,313
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a yes.

490
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:23,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Now to our final topic or close to final topic, board elections.

491
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:24,301
[SPEAKER_12]: So the board

492
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:32,574
[SPEAKER_12]: As we know, our former chair has turned out and he has left.

493
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:41,799
[SPEAKER_12]: And so now we have to elect a new chair, as well as me sitting in the vice chair position, that position has to be reelected.

494
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:45,982
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we also need a community preservation committee representative.

495
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:51,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, that's just to start off the conversations.

496
00:38:52,107 --> 00:38:55,572
[SPEAKER_12]: I have decided to put my head in for the chair position.

497
00:38:56,434 --> 00:39:00,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and I didn't know if anyone else was also vying to be chair.

498
00:39:02,152 --> 00:39:04,232
[SPEAKER_14]: If you didn't put your name for it, I was gonna nominate you.

499
00:39:09,073 --> 00:39:11,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you so much for the vote of confidence, Emily.

500
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,354
[SPEAKER_12]: With my technical difficulties and everything over here, I'm like.

501
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:24,576
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess carrying no other names, I'll do a roll call vote for Jackie McPherson for chair.

502
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:28,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Amanda, is that correct?

503
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:31,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yes, that sounds right.

504
00:39:31,623 --> 00:39:37,327
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I just wanted to make sure before I pompously move forward.

505
00:39:37,527 --> 00:39:39,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Emily Hederman?

506
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:41,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Enthusiastic, yes.

507
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

508
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

509
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:45,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Preeta Cowles?

510
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:47,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, definitely.

511
00:39:49,155 --> 00:39:49,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Ari Fishman?

512
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:52,217
[SPEAKER_12]: An enthusiastic yes.

513
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:54,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Pam Marionski?

514
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:55,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

515
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Sally Akiki?

516
00:39:57,901 --> 00:39:58,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

517
00:39:59,342 --> 00:40:01,483
[SPEAKER_12]: And myself, of course, I'm Jackie McPherson.

518
00:40:01,563 --> 00:40:01,983
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a yes.

519
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:18,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, if anyone, because now there's no vice chair to back me up, or as per our ordinance, would anyone like to put their hat in for the vice chair position?

520
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:23,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and if I may, chair?

521
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:28,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just as a reminder, vice chair duties.

522
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:38,411
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea being that in the absence of the chair, they, you know, would be first in line to to step in to help facilitate a meeting.

523
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:48,755
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if, for example, the chair maybe has to recuse themselves for an item, you know, we would turn to the vice chair for

524
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:50,576
[SPEAKER_01]: assistance in that.

525
00:40:51,237 --> 00:41:06,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jackie, if you have any, you know, tokens or mementos, that's the wrong word, but anything you want to add to the description about kind of the role you've played, please feel free to help inform folks.

526
00:41:07,587 --> 00:41:08,087
[SPEAKER_12]: No, definitely.

527
00:41:08,107 --> 00:41:08,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Amanda.

528
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:24,440
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you've captured well, and it's literally a backup to the chair where if David has recused the former chair, Bloomberg had to recuse himself for anything, which is maybe only once or twice that I've known that him being chair, I've had to step in.

529
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had the opportunity or honor to step in.

530
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:31,285
[SPEAKER_12]: And then obviously now with him having turned out,

531
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:44,031
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to step in and provide the chair role now, but there was no difference than being a regular board member, but just knowing in the back of your mind that, you know, he would reach out in enough time to give you that option.

532
00:41:44,512 --> 00:41:49,495
[SPEAKER_12]: So it wasn't like it was a surprise or anything like that, but just being a backup.

533
00:41:55,325 --> 00:42:06,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I think perhaps it's helpful for people to know, we actually, Amanda has been preparing and Danielle will continue to prepare as we do this, an actual script.

534
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:10,618
[SPEAKER_10]: So if it seemed to you that Jackie was saying almost exactly the same things that David said,

535
00:42:11,518 --> 00:42:17,881
[SPEAKER_10]: If you ever have to step in, we actually provide, like, here are the things that you need to do, and these are the questions you need to ask.

536
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:23,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, so it's, you're never, you never just, like, have to figure it out or remember on your own.

537
00:42:23,923 --> 00:42:29,186
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually provide you with that in advance so that you know what's going on.

538
00:42:29,526 --> 00:42:36,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that was an invention, I think, of Amanda's, and it makes things a little less stressful for everybody.

539
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:54,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So that that helps facilitate these meetings, and some of the things, just just for full transparency the city has been awesome and helping to guide conversations not so much to just just given another perspective of what

540
00:42:56,138 --> 00:43:09,185
[SPEAKER_12]: what we should be looking at, not so much in how we're to determine anything, but so we've been getting a lot of administrative assistance from the city in that respect, which I have definitely appreciated from Danielle with the PDS going forward.

541
00:43:09,225 --> 00:43:14,408
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're never out on a limb, kind of just to give that background.

542
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:20,591
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be happy to step up and put my name forth for the vice chair election.

543
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:24,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, Emily.

544
00:43:24,726 --> 00:43:30,688
[SPEAKER_14]: I welcome competitors or conspirators, however we want to frame it.

545
00:43:33,209 --> 00:43:35,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, Emily, for stepping up.

546
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:45,873
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are going to do a roll call for Emily, if there's no other people that want to vie for the position of vice chair.

547
00:43:48,854 --> 00:43:50,415
[SPEAKER_12]: So roll call, Emily Hedeman.

548
00:43:51,786 --> 00:43:52,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

549
00:43:53,308 --> 00:43:53,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

550
00:43:53,628 --> 00:43:53,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

551
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:55,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

552
00:44:08,703 --> 00:44:11,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Emily, and welcome.

553
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:18,470
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this means the clerk position is now open.

554
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:24,073
[SPEAKER_12]: So now we're just going to come back to Amanda and sort of say, okay, so now we have the clerk position.

555
00:44:24,093 --> 00:44:27,716
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things that I've learned about the clerk position is that

556
00:44:28,136 --> 00:44:34,323
[SPEAKER_12]: I was asking Amanda about taking conditions as we're going through the meeting and things like that, if I'm supposed to write them, if Amanda's supposed to write them.

557
00:44:34,363 --> 00:44:39,349
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's something more that the city wants to lean kind of on the clerk for.

558
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:45,736
[SPEAKER_12]: So just keeping that in mind, not to scare anyone away, but Amanda, you can go into more detail about that position.

559
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely, yeah.

560
00:44:49,717 --> 00:45:11,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And Emily, if you want to offer any of your insight as, you know, former clerk now, you're welcome to, but I think clerk position, the understanding is in terms of role, reviewing the minutes in particular, to ensure that, you know, they're matching what memory of what occurred in the meeting, looking for any errors there.

561
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:15,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we were talking a little bit with Jackie about

562
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:28,984
[SPEAKER_01]: And by we, I mean Danielle and I, whether it might make sense to have the clerk participate in sort of as deliberations are going on, capturing notes about conditions.

563
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:34,946
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I do and I'm happy to continue doing.

564
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:43,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think why we're suggesting it is that it can be helpful to ensure that there's another person just to sort of

565
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:54,152
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, safety check that things are being caught, or maybe the framing of something is a little different than, you know, how I jot it down or something like that.

566
00:45:55,793 --> 00:46:03,714
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's sort of, this is a new thing that we're sort of discussing, and we can talk with a new clerk about what makes sense and what doesn't.

567
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:12,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I can add it was a very straightforward role.

568
00:46:14,052 --> 00:46:26,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Having previously served on a different cities, redevelopment authority, I brought over like a few updates to the practices but overall Amanda Alicia and Danielle are fabulously organized.

569
00:46:27,997 --> 00:46:30,758
[SPEAKER_14]: So, there weren't a ton of duties.

570
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:51,442
[SPEAKER_14]: And the rest of the, the board does do a great job in terms of reviewing the minutes, I think we've, we've all had corrections at this point that we've brought up the added responsibilities to me makes sense, and may allow the board to kind of retain its independence.

571
00:46:52,453 --> 00:47:02,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, you know, we obviously look to the city for advice for recommendations, but at the end of the day, we are, you know, an independent board, and this could be an important step for us.

572
00:47:10,304 --> 00:47:13,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Emily, for articulating exactly what I was trying to articulate.

573
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:29,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to clarify, this isn't going to be responsible for taking own notes, just kind of double-checking existing notes?

574
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:41,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So a clerk would be responsible for reading and reviewing the minutes, which would be taken by staff and produced by staff, which is something that I think most people are doing now anyway.

575
00:47:42,128 --> 00:47:49,050
[SPEAKER_01]: But just having at least one person designated on that is really helpful for keeping track

576
00:47:49,651 --> 00:47:51,694
[SPEAKER_01]: and keeping pace with those as they're churned out.

577
00:47:52,335 --> 00:48:01,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the added piece of having someone who's keeping track in a meeting if there's, you know, discourse or deliberation on potential conditions.

578
00:48:03,232 --> 00:48:23,004
[SPEAKER_01]: capturing some of those in your own notes to ensure that at the end of the call, or not call, but meeting, as we're kind of listing out conditions, what I've captured is aligned with what actually happened or what the board is remembering.

579
00:48:23,024 --> 00:48:29,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of like a check on what I'm capturing.

580
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

581
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:40,466
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone else is willing to do the community board, I'm happy to do that.

582
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:45,590
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean the community preservation board?

583
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:46,951
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.

584
00:48:47,512 --> 00:48:47,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

585
00:48:48,633 --> 00:49:00,843
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, maybe rather than voting on the clerk right now, we could kind of open up the discussion to also if there are folks that are interested in the community preservation committee representative role.

586
00:49:04,504 --> 00:49:15,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the new people, the discussion is that it is that a member of our committee sit on that committee.

587
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:30,296
[SPEAKER_02]: The previous representative from our committee out since the last meeting, I agreed to take it on from, but it's not particularly my area of priority.

588
00:49:30,536 --> 00:49:33,498
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have enough personal stuff that I like am not

589
00:49:34,512 --> 00:49:36,292
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really want to do it all year.

590
00:49:37,293 --> 00:49:41,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were hoping that we could revisit and see if any of the new people are interested.

591
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:48,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It does involve working to allocate an approximately $1 million budget across the city.

592
00:49:48,796 --> 00:49:50,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is a really valuable committee.

593
00:49:52,497 --> 00:49:56,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in my personal life, it's not a great time to be adding a second one.

594
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:05,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and if I can add a little bit more context, thank you, Ari.

595
00:50:06,155 --> 00:50:28,469
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Community Preservation Committee, I think I've mentioned to each of you, responsible for allocating or making recommendations to city council for the allocation of upwards of a million dollars of funding to very important projects that fall into one of three, or maybe fall into multiple of these three buckets, which is affordable housing,

596
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:35,489
[SPEAKER_01]: open space and recreation and historical preservation and, oh, I'm sorry.

597
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:37,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

598
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:38,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I was clearing my throat.

599
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:40,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no worries.

600
00:50:41,814 --> 00:50:55,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are so many amazing projects coming out of the city and also out of the community at large that are touched by CPA and funded through it, at least partially, and sometimes entirely.

601
00:50:55,656 --> 00:50:59,257
[SPEAKER_01]: The meetings are once a month.

602
00:50:59,717 --> 00:51:03,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they're first Tuesdays in the evening over Zoom.

603
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,778
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little slower in the summer.

604
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:09,479
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes no meetings then.

605
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:15,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do it is important to have rather than rotating folks in and out of it.

606
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,861
[SPEAKER_01]: As a representative, it does feel important to have someone who's there for a full year.

607
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:23,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's there's an annual funding cycle.

608
00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:28,143
[SPEAKER_01]: So to have someone sort of like punch in and then another person punch in later.

609
00:51:29,626 --> 00:51:41,169
[SPEAKER_01]: would be hard for like, understanding sort of the full, you know, process, and seeing like where following an application or applications through the process.

610
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:51,651
[SPEAKER_01]: But it might make sense to, rather than have someone have a term of, you know, two or three years, you know, the full term of their, you

611
00:51:53,262 --> 00:52:03,427
[SPEAKER_01]: CD board enrollment, if you will, to do it, to change it up annually if there is a fear of being able to kind of commit on the longer term.

612
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:33,945
[SPEAKER_14]: I do just want to thank RE for their involvement in this position.

613
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:35,127
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds like it was a lot of work.

614
00:52:36,468 --> 00:52:39,512
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you so much for doing it, you know, so far.

615
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had to do much.

616
00:52:42,755 --> 00:52:47,200
[SPEAKER_02]: The July meeting was canceled as part of the flow.

617
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually been a very light lift for

618
00:52:50,778 --> 00:52:59,324
[SPEAKER_02]: are I'm just trying to be responsible about next year and knowing that I wouldn't be able to give my full commitment to two committees.

619
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:04,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your previous willingness and your current transparency.

620
00:53:14,034 --> 00:53:17,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, so I was kicked out of the meeting for a little bit.

621
00:53:17,957 --> 00:53:19,418
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize if I missed

622
00:53:20,168 --> 00:53:34,613
[SPEAKER_12]: If anyone, at your presentation, Amanda, of the, what it entails to be a CPA representative, I wasn't sure if anyone wanted to, if anyone had put their hat in, their name in the hat.

623
00:53:42,236 --> 00:53:44,417
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I'm not even sure if any of you can hear me, okay.

624
00:53:45,797 --> 00:53:47,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sorry, we can hear you.

625
00:53:58,063 --> 00:53:59,585
[SPEAKER_12]: part of my technical difficulties.

626
00:53:59,605 --> 00:54:02,650
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm working on three different computers now, not just one.

627
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:03,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no.

628
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:06,435
[SPEAKER_12]: That's life.

629
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:10,020
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

630
00:54:12,422 --> 00:54:16,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, there are a couple more.

631
00:54:16,785 --> 00:54:24,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, you know, two associate member roles and one final full member role that we need to fill.

632
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:32,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps it makes sense to delay this and let folks think a little bit about, you know, what the commitment might entail.

633
00:54:32,753 --> 00:54:34,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce new people.

634
00:54:34,874 --> 00:54:38,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely want to look at my Tuesdays to see, I mean,

635
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:51,490
[SPEAKER_03]: If nobody else didn't do it, I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to doing it, but I would need to look, I mean, kind of similar to Ari, like I want to make sure I'd be able to not overcommit myself and then not be able to do it.

636
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:53,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.

637
00:54:54,121 --> 00:55:05,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so yeah, perhaps the approach, and I'll let you all decide, is maybe we wait and take this up at the next meeting, and folks can kind of mull it over.

638
00:55:05,543 --> 00:55:09,224
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, please feel free to reach out to me or Danielle if you have questions.

639
00:55:09,904 --> 00:55:19,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Danielle actually used to be the coordinator for the CPC, and so she would have plenty of insight as to kind of the feel of it.

640
00:55:22,222 --> 00:55:28,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And the previous representative is very happy to chat and answer any questions as well.

641
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely just volunteered her for that, but she offered it to me.

642
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Marisa is great and very, yes, absolutely.

643
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:47,915
[SPEAKER_01]: She's our new coordinator and I'm sure she would be happy to speak with a prospective member.

644
00:55:53,956 --> 00:55:56,278
[SPEAKER_12]: So, we're going to table for now.

645
00:55:56,298 --> 00:56:01,002
[SPEAKER_12]: So, are you okay staying as CPA rep in the interim or are you?

646
00:56:01,122 --> 00:56:01,282
Yeah.

647
00:56:01,963 --> 00:56:02,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

648
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,947
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you'll stay and then we'll revisit clerk and CPA going forward.

649
00:56:07,968 --> 00:56:08,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

650
00:56:08,589 --> 00:56:14,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Amanda, do you have any miscellaneous updates or announcements?

651
00:56:15,516 --> 00:56:22,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe I'll just, I know that there are a few folks that will be absent at the next meeting on August 2nd.

652
00:56:23,545 --> 00:56:25,367
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for letting me know ahead of time.

653
00:56:25,447 --> 00:56:26,608
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely helpful.

654
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:29,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's not always possible, but thank you.

655
00:56:30,272 --> 00:56:37,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the folks that will be attending, there will be a couple of interesting things on the agenda, some of which were

656
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,921
[SPEAKER_01]: planned to be for tonight.

657
00:56:39,861 --> 00:56:44,003
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you'll have a head start on some of those meeting materials, thankfully.

658
00:56:45,743 --> 00:56:56,928
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have two PDD, so Planned Development District conversations that evening, one of which is 243 Mystic, which was the one originally planned for tonight.

659
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:00,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're working with them to button up a

660
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:05,741
[SPEAKER_01]: a tidy draft amendment to present to you all.

661
00:57:06,282 --> 00:57:09,065
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see that.

662
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:14,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for Verdant Bio, the proposed lab structure on Harvard and Mystic.

663
00:57:15,591 --> 00:57:17,393
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, the folks that

664
00:57:18,294 --> 00:57:24,722
[SPEAKER_01]: are new, won't know this, but others will be familiar with 100 Winchester Street.

665
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:31,329
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a planned development district residential with like a potential office or daycare use on the side.

666
00:57:32,311 --> 00:57:34,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So they went, they came to the board.

667
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:46,141
[SPEAKER_01]: some weeks, maybe month or so ago, and presented kind of an initial initial proposal for plan development district.

668
00:57:46,621 --> 00:57:50,604
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with them, and they submitted something to city council.

669
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:56,910
[SPEAKER_01]: City Council is required to automatically refer that draft back to the board.

670
00:57:57,411 --> 00:58:03,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this will be that secondary phase in this process.

671
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:08,876
[SPEAKER_01]: So public hearing discussing again the zoning, but it has evolved a little bit since the last time you guys saw it.

672
00:58:08,976 --> 00:58:11,957
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it will be an interesting conversation.

673
00:58:14,336 --> 00:58:16,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, yeah, we'll see.

674
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:25,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I think again mentioned this a ways back to some of the previous members, but there were some kind of immediate term.

675
00:58:26,147 --> 00:58:33,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Urgent, um, zoning ordinance changes that, um, City Council in our office drafted together.

676
00:58:34,795 --> 00:58:37,377
[SPEAKER_01]: and they went out.

677
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:49,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Those changes went to City Council, and they've been referred to the board to review, so that will be on the agenda next meeting as well, along with site plan review for H Mart and.

678
00:58:50,907 --> 00:58:52,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's yeah, that's it.

679
00:58:52,468 --> 00:58:55,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Site plan review for H Mart, which was originally for tonight.

680
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:57,999
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of things on the horizon.

681
00:58:58,499 --> 00:59:02,743
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to keep, you know, I'll keep all of those materials.

682
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:15,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll start a folder with the materials from tonight that will still be relevant moving forward and send it to you all just so you'll have it in one spot and you can refer to it because I know it is a fuller agenda.

683
00:59:16,396 --> 00:59:18,298
[SPEAKER_01]: So having stuff ahead of time, hopefully.

684
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,221
[SPEAKER_01]: to give a little bit more time for review if you want it.

685
00:59:23,062 --> 00:59:26,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise, I think that is it on my end.

686
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:28,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia, anything you want to add?

687
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:48,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the new members, and I did actually want to share with the board that our office has hired a climate policy planner, who will be starting on Monday I'm very excited, somebody I've worked with before in the past, so I'm really glad that she's joining our team here in Medford.

688
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:52,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess now we're close enough.

689
00:59:53,393 --> 00:59:54,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's signed and sealed.

690
00:59:54,613 --> 00:59:56,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Her name is Brenda Pike.

691
00:59:57,034 --> 00:59:58,535
[SPEAKER_10]: She's also a UEP grad.

692
00:59:58,555 --> 01:00:04,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually met her before she actually was at UEP, ironically.

693
01:00:06,377 --> 01:00:08,319
[SPEAKER_10]: But that we're very excited about.

694
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:18,110
[SPEAKER_10]: We are still taking applications, if you know anybody, for economic development director, for economic planner, and administrative assistant.

695
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:25,418
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are opportunities to join our very fun, exciting office where we do all kinds of interesting things.

696
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:27,492
[SPEAKER_10]: if you know anybody.

697
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:34,902
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've shared those around in the past, but the city's website has a jobs listing that has those positions listed.

698
01:00:35,002 --> 01:00:39,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I should make sure that climate planners come down now that that's signed and sealed.

699
01:00:40,557 --> 01:00:41,878
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyhow, I just wanted to share that.

700
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:45,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I am not sure if I'm going to be on the next meeting.

701
01:00:45,899 --> 01:00:51,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of need to be because of some of those items, but I will be on vacation that week.

702
01:00:51,221 --> 01:00:56,443
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'll all have to forgive me if I have a beautiful beach background when I'm on the call.

703
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:15,866
[SPEAKER_12]: There was one miscellaneous item that I want to discuss openly, speaking of assistance from the city and that's, and having discussions with Amanda, we were talking about the ability to have site visits.

704
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:19,367
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that sometimes when we get the materials, we have just enough time to visit.

705
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:22,709
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, just enough time to go over them and not really enough time to visit.

706
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:29,012
[SPEAKER_12]: And Amanda has offered a solution that can pretty much help the board

707
01:01:30,097 --> 01:01:32,904
[SPEAKER_12]: implement or make a site visit happen.

708
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Amanda, do you want to speak on that?

709
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:37,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

710
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:37,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

711
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:49,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely recognize that, you know, often there's material to go through and it can be hard to schedule a site visit for especially if there are multiple sites that you want to check out before a meeting.

712
01:01:50,872 --> 01:02:00,540
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Danielle and I are kind of putting our heads together a little bit and we get applications obviously far in advance of putting them before the board.

713
01:02:00,661 --> 01:02:01,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for things that

714
01:02:02,929 --> 01:02:21,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Where there's, I don't think that there's a necessity, I mean, and you may feel otherwise for every single item to require a site visit and historically it's not been a practice in recent years, but there are some projects where there might be some nuance to the, you know.

715
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:34,670
[SPEAKER_01]: the grade of a site that's like really hard to capture in just looking at Google Maps or at some of the kind of, you know, 2D renderings of, or, you know, site plan, etc.

716
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:35,610
[SPEAKER_01]: renderings.

717
01:02:36,411 --> 01:02:39,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would like to identify those kind of ahead of time, and

718
01:02:41,935 --> 01:02:50,422
[SPEAKER_01]: let folks know a couple weeks in advance of any meeting or public hearing that the opportunity to visit is available.

719
01:02:50,542 --> 01:02:53,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would help coordinate and kind of orchestrate that.

720
01:02:55,506 --> 01:03:00,811
[SPEAKER_01]: And just wanted to sort of introduce it as something that you might see from us.

721
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:04,674
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if you had concerns about any of it, happy to hear.

722
01:03:04,694 --> 01:03:08,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Amanda.

723
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:18,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you clarify for them, just so that it's clear, would such a thing be required of board members?

724
01:03:18,249 --> 01:03:19,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Would it be quorum?

725
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:22,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Would they be invited to go individually and look at sites?

726
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:27,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you talking about visiting as a group in a way that would have to be posted?

727
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,543
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's more than quorum, it might have to be posted.

728
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:36,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so everybody's actually understanding and on the same page different iterations of that went through my head.

729
01:03:36,956 --> 01:03:37,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

730
01:03:37,476 --> 01:03:44,484
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think like Danielle and I need to think a little bit more about it, but I don't think that we would require flat out.

731
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:49,967
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone, but I think there would be some strong recommendations.

732
01:03:51,408 --> 01:04:09,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you know, it might be, maybe we could talk to you guys about what would be simpler, but I feel like in some senses, as long as there's a range of times that are available for folks to pop in, that it would be easier and more flexible for people to go individually and just check things out.

733
01:04:09,537 --> 01:04:15,784
[SPEAKER_01]: And by site visit, I mean, you know, very informal, walking the site, just getting a feel on the ground.

734
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:23,172
[SPEAKER_01]: No necessarily like no tours or, you know, definitely no presentation happening while there.

735
01:04:25,067 --> 01:04:26,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the clarification.

736
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:30,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Clarifying question, Alicia, as well as Amanda, following up with that.

737
01:04:30,732 --> 01:04:38,358
[SPEAKER_12]: What I had more in mind is like, for instance, I will get for myself, for my own interests, sometimes I will get the material and I'll say, well, I wish I had time.

738
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:43,323
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, you know, I just did my walk on that or I just I was at the grocery store on that side and I wish I had a time.

739
01:04:43,743 --> 01:04:47,265
[SPEAKER_12]: a chance to kind of see this because it'd be like some tiny nuance.

740
01:04:47,866 --> 01:04:50,487
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's just for my own personal preference.

741
01:04:50,507 --> 01:05:04,155
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I thought maybe it could be open up to the entire board, not so much as mandatory or even a requirement, but more if you had the time and you wanted to be able to see a project.

742
01:05:04,195 --> 01:05:09,999
[SPEAKER_12]: If they thought that there was a problem, someone that could not be pretty much understood on paper, if we can get enough time

743
01:05:11,055 --> 01:05:14,476
[SPEAKER_12]: to decide if we wanted to go out individually and see the site.

744
01:05:14,496 --> 01:05:21,858
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what you're saying, like, because you get email saying here are the locations, here's the information, like a week in advance.

745
01:05:22,499 --> 01:05:31,141
[SPEAKER_10]: But some of these, we actually have the filings 35 days in advance because we have to circulate it to department heads.

746
01:05:31,521 --> 01:05:36,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you prefer that when we circulate it to department heads,

747
01:05:36,623 --> 01:05:41,888
[SPEAKER_10]: that we let you know these are the things that are coming up.

748
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:53,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just trying to think if there was a way that we keep for ourselves lists of what addresses are assigned to which dates, because we have to keep track of them.

749
01:05:53,660 --> 01:06:05,408
[SPEAKER_10]: If there was some way to share that information so that you could know like, oh, a filing for 100 Winchester Street came in, it will be on your agenda in September.

750
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:07,990
[SPEAKER_10]: But now you know that it's there.

751
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:14,355
[SPEAKER_10]: And because anything like that, it would be in advance of department head comments.

752
01:06:16,036 --> 01:06:24,547
[SPEAKER_10]: And we send you those as we get them in some cases or closer to the agenda, but at least then you would be aware that it's coming.

753
01:06:26,879 --> 01:06:33,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Mine is more so like if it's a PDD and it's coming to a certain area, like we're very new at the PDD process.

754
01:06:33,561 --> 01:06:39,644
[SPEAKER_12]: So let me see where this, I wanna see it visually, off paper kind of thing.

755
01:06:39,664 --> 01:06:41,124
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's more of what I was talking about.

756
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:48,207
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not gonna be every single project, but just if the board wanted to see something that they had an interest in seeing on the ground.

757
01:06:49,347 --> 01:06:50,828
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all, not everything.

758
01:06:50,888 --> 01:06:53,188
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a lot of the things that we can pretty much tackle

759
01:06:56,333 --> 01:07:07,383
[SPEAKER_12]: virtually, but just if there was like an extra, not to burden the board more, just giving them extra help in trying to figure it out, that's all.

760
01:07:14,658 --> 01:07:22,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like some people really like as much advanced notice as possible and other people Want to just focus on the things that are in front of them.

761
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:37,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah um for the next upcoming and I think that in my mind the only way to accommodate that is to say well if we provide you all the information You have to decide for yourself That's not coming for a month.

762
01:07:37,284 --> 01:07:42,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to think about it or I want to know about it right like

763
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:48,856
[SPEAKER_10]: We certainly it's need to give all the board members, the same information at the same time.

764
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:50,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

765
01:07:50,657 --> 01:07:54,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I can't tell Jackie, but not Emily about an upcoming project, right?

766
01:07:54,439 --> 01:07:57,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that is one piece of it.

767
01:07:57,141 --> 01:07:58,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Pam, did you have a thought on it?

768
01:07:58,922 --> 01:07:59,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

769
01:07:59,082 --> 01:08:05,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something not put more work on anybody else, but, um, you know, Amanda has, you know, whatever the meeting come up that.

770
01:08:05,926 --> 01:08:10,509
[SPEAKER_09]: That file folder could there just be like a running Excel sheet in there where.

771
01:08:11,165 --> 01:08:24,132
[SPEAKER_09]: just if people are interested in what's coming down the line could that just be sort of a standing document that's always in that folder that we get in advance of the meeting, just for people who are interested in like knowing what's coming down and now everybody has access.

772
01:08:25,133 --> 01:08:29,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if everyone who needs to have access will have access maybe there's another way to do it, but one thought.

773
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:46,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like the idea because so there's basically every time there's a meeting, I send you guys like a new folder, but that sub folder exists in a larger folder that in theory, you know, you could all have access to it's all just organized by date.

774
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:54,444
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could put a spreadsheet in that larger folder that just lives there that keeps track of meeting dates.

775
01:08:54,784 --> 01:08:59,145
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as agenda items kind of pop on, and then if there are things that

776
01:08:59,785 --> 01:09:06,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Danielle, for example, is like, oh my gosh, this would probably make a lot more sense to someone if they see it on the ground.

777
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:10,652
[SPEAKER_01]: We can flag it for you all and try to give you some notice.

778
01:09:11,672 --> 01:09:20,358
[SPEAKER_01]: But then otherwise, you can just kind of look to this sheet to get a sense of what's coming up and if there's something of interest that you want to check out on your own time.

779
01:09:23,147 --> 01:09:30,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, so Amanda, are you thinking, they've probably never had shared to them that enclosing file, the Medford CD board shared files.

780
01:09:31,188 --> 01:09:33,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm thinking of sharing that.

781
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:43,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, so if you were to look in this folder, and I don't know if I could just share it if that's helpful.

782
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:47,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if a visual, for some people visual works really well.

783
01:09:47,171 --> 01:09:50,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, I can actually, I've got it.

784
01:09:52,307 --> 01:10:02,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Like this, right, so this is a folder that every month, for every meeting, Amanda makes a folder, and then inside of it is the folder that you see.

785
01:10:02,775 --> 01:10:09,220
[SPEAKER_10]: But then we have some additional planning efforts, reference resources, and archives.

786
01:10:09,781 --> 01:10:11,582
[SPEAKER_10]: We could have a spreadsheet at this level.

787
01:10:11,602 --> 01:10:16,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Amanda, I don't know at what point you actually build out those folders, because I was just thinking,

788
01:10:17,807 --> 01:10:28,734
[SPEAKER_10]: In my mind, wouldn't it be easier as you get stuff to immediately start to to build out the folder for august 2nd and august 16th To start to put them in there.

789
01:10:28,754 --> 01:10:40,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that you then rename renumber them So they all get named with the number they are on the agenda Um, right, so each of these is one of the agenda items for tonight

790
01:10:42,387 --> 01:10:47,231
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously, you wouldn't know that information until the agenda is settled.

791
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:52,335
[SPEAKER_10]: But you would have had these files already that are in there.

792
01:10:52,795 --> 01:11:00,441
[SPEAKER_01]: There is like a decent amount of kind of like updating of materials and like revised materials that get sent to us.

793
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:02,142
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how early I could

794
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:06,075
[SPEAKER_01]: give the meeting materials.

795
01:11:07,356 --> 01:11:14,481
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to confuse folks by putting stuff that gets changed out later or something like that.

796
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:31,175
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think having the full folder that has all the archived materials and this living spreadsheet that just shares what the meetings are and what's going on there is definitely easy and feasible if it's going to be helpful to folks.

797
01:11:31,935 --> 01:11:44,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, to be clear, an applicant may send us a site plan and landscape plan and civil and get comments from our traffic engineer and revise it and send us a new version.

798
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:48,393
[SPEAKER_10]: And so our goal is to not make you look at all those iterations.

799
01:11:49,073 --> 01:11:53,538
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't want to waste your time looking at a version that then gets replaced with a newer version.

800
01:11:53,985 --> 01:11:59,966
[SPEAKER_10]: So at the point that Amanda sends you the files, these are the ones you should be looking at for the meeting.

801
01:12:00,386 --> 01:12:06,027
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you had seen the original version, that might be the same, but it might not.

802
01:12:07,048 --> 01:12:19,470
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't wanna waste anybody's time looking at what they think are final files, but they're not final until they get the comments from the traffic engineer and the civil engineer and, you know.

803
01:12:20,387 --> 01:12:22,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry when we blew up big.

804
01:12:23,129 --> 01:12:24,430
[SPEAKER_10]: So would it be files?

805
01:12:25,411 --> 01:12:48,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Would it be helpful on this spreadsheet to add the status of the project, like if it's still under review by the engineer so that whoever is planning to go out so that they know if the drawing would be final or not, maybe adding a status would be helpful, like under discussion or under review by the engineers or ready to be reviewed by the board.

806
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:53,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we can do something like that.

807
01:12:53,923 --> 01:13:02,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'll just, I don't want to have too many different spreadsheets that staff is working off of versus board is looking to.

808
01:13:02,907 --> 01:13:05,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I'll merge some stuff.

809
01:13:06,909 --> 01:13:16,293
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, yeah, having status, intended meeting date, and maybe a little description about what it is.

810
01:13:18,454 --> 01:13:24,106
[SPEAKER_01]: could be a good place to start, and if there's anything else that people would like, you can let me know.

811
01:13:25,188 --> 01:13:32,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for even entertaining it Amanda, I didn't want to add any extra arduous tasks onto it at the same time, just like with land use, right?

812
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:36,394
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to make sure that you're using the board's highest and best use of time.

813
01:13:36,434 --> 01:13:42,238
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just know that there's just been a couple of instances that I wish I had a little bit more time to myself.

814
01:13:42,398 --> 01:13:44,079
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I was just opening it up for the board.

815
01:13:44,099 --> 01:13:49,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And I didn't mean to make that a huge thing, but... No, I think it's a great suggestion.

816
01:13:52,925 --> 01:13:55,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you for the discussion, everyone.

817
01:13:55,366 --> 01:14:03,489
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point, if there is nothing else on the agenda, if no one else has anything to add, I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.

818
01:14:07,631 --> 01:14:08,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion.

819
01:14:08,892 --> 01:14:10,732
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll second it, Pam.

820
01:14:10,752 --> 01:14:11,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Second motion.
