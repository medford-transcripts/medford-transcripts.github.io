1
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:41,052
All right.

2
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:42,684
We're tired.

3
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:43,526
Is that me?

4
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:37,122
Yeah, that's nice.

5
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,722
It's very, very, very important.

6
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:16,974
Yeah.

7
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:45,889
Mayor, can you hear us in chambers?

8
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:59,269
Yes, yes, yes, I heard you, yes, thank you.

9
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:04,517
Okay, thank you everyone for your patience.

10
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,850
Thank you everyone for your patience.

11
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:17,113
We do have some exciting and welcome news out of executive session.

12
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:27,798
We have ratified our contract with the security monitors in our schools and I will await a motion to approve and a roll call vote.

13
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:41,082
Motion to approve the security monitors contract as has been ratified by the monitors themselves by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hayes.

17
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:46,744
Member Hayes.

19
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:48,045
Member Kratz.

20
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:48,525
Yes.

21
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:49,385
Member McLaughlin.

22
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:49,925
Yes.

23
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:50,726
Member McStone.

24
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:51,066
Yes.

25
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:51,966
Member Rousseau.

26
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:53,287
Yes.

27
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:55,047
And Mayor Lungo-Kern.

28
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:56,068

29
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:00,138
seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

30
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:03,519
We have an approved ratified contract with our security monitors.

31
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,520
Second, wonderful piece of news.

32
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:16,662
We've reached an agreement and the administrators have ratified their contract with the school district.

33
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:22,584
So we have all of our administrators, assistant principals, department heads,

34
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:28,888
directors of athletics, et cetera, all sit under the administrator's union and contract.

35
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:33,853
And we are happy to announce that we've ratified their contract as well.

36
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:35,796
And so I will wait a motion to approve.

37
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:43,644
Motion to approve the administrator's contract by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Hayes.

38

Yes.

51
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:54,823
Mayor Longo?

52
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,544
I abstain.

53
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:00,627
Six in the affirmative, one in abstention.

54
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:03,288
The administrator's contract is ratified.

55
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,214
Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business?

56
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:19,272
Motion to revert to the regular order of business by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hayes.

57
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:19,972

Member Hayes.

60
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:25,436
Yes.

61
00:19:25,636 --> 00:19:26,117
Member Katz.

62
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:26,557
Yes.

63
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:27,378
Member McLaughlin.

64
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:27,978
Yes.

65
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:28,659
Member Bestone.

66
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:29,079

67
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:29,799

71
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:35,263
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

72
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:38,126
We are back on our regular order of business.

73
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:41,028
So item number two, the good of the order.

74
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:47,138
I will see if any of my colleagues have suggestions, questions.

75
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,100
Member McLaughlin.

76
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:22,610
But maybe we put it on the next agenda.

77
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:25,212
Okay, for the good of the order.

78
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:26,413
Thank you.

79
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:27,253
On the next agenda.

80
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:33,658
There are other comments for the good of the order from the committee.

81
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,964
Member Rousseau, I'll just volunteer to do that so that six of us don't send the same thing to the next agenda.

82
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,466
The school committee.

83
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,004
Yeah, so I'll just volunteer to do that.

84
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:50,126
I'll be putting it on the agenda next time, so we'd all know.

85
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:51,047
Thank you.

86
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:52,668
Either nobody does it or everybody does it.

87
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:53,169
Thank you.

88
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,250
Thank you for that.

89
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,552
Any other comments for the good of the order?

90
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:01,935
OK, moving on.

91
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:04,958
Number four, we have the consent agenda.

92
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:10,081
We have bills and payrolls and the regular school committee meeting minutes from September 18, 2023.

93
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:11,102
Is there a motion to approve?

94
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,590
Motion to approve by Member Hayes.

95
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:18,370
Second.

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,751
Seconded by Member Kratz.

97
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:20,512
Roll call.

98
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,140
Member Graham?

99
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:34,740
Yes.

100
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,420
Member Hayes?

101
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:35,961
Yes.

102
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:36,701
Member Kratz?

103
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:37,402
Yes.

104
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:38,742
Member McLaughlin?

105
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:39,363
Yes.

106
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:40,303
Member Mustone?

107
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:40,643
Yes.

108
00:21:41,204 --> 00:21:41,704
Member Orso?

109
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:41,964
Yes.

110
00:21:42,044 --> 00:21:42,725
Mayor Longo Kern?

111
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:43,225
Yes.

112
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:49,762
seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the consent agenda is approved.

113
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:56,811
We have no reports of subcommittee today, so we are on to number six, which is the report of the superintendent.

114
00:21:57,973 --> 00:22:01,658
Item number one is the superintendent's updates and comments, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

115
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:03,318
Thank you.

116
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:04,319
Good evening.

117
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,622
I just wanted to share that I can't believe that it is already October.

118
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:20,589
And as I shared in my weekly memo last week, I've noticed the shifting leaves in our beautiful Middlesex fells, the chilly mornings, and of course the many football games on TV.

119
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,591
So autumn is officially here for us.

120
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:29,235
I also want to acknowledge that October is breast cancer awareness month.

121
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:40,920
Approximately 300,000 Americans will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, but early detection is a key to successful outcomes.

122
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:45,381
This month, everyone should take time to learn about the signs.

123
00:22:46,302 --> 00:22:52,023
Consider visiting NBCF.org to get lots of helpful information

124
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:58,690
from the National Breast Cancer Foundation or to get involved in their national advocacy work.

125
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:03,616
And yesterday was the big breast cancer walk in Boston.

126
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,339
So let's just remember that.

127
00:23:08,061 --> 00:23:12,084
I also have some sad news to share from the education community.

128
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:21,512
We will mention it later, but I just want to take a moment to mention the recent passing of Mr. Charlie Lyons.

129
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:30,079
He was the esteemed former superintendent of Shawsheen Technical High School and a well-loved and experienced public servant.

130
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,823
He was actively involved in Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents.

131
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:50,636
He was an incomparable advocate for all public schools, particularly career technical education, and his loss is keenly felt by those of us who are lucky to be his peers, colleagues and beneficiaries.

132
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:55,800
I remember the last time meeting with him at the Medford High School campus.

133
00:23:56,921 --> 00:24:01,185
And so I just want to share that may his soul rest in peace.

134
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:08,311
And, you know, I wish, you know, comfort for his family as they deal with his loss.

135
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:21,262
I also want to share with the committee and the community that this Monday, October 9th, all schools will be closed in observance of Indigenous Peoples Day.

136
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:32,113
Also on Saturday, October 7, we have the disability fair, and the Malden Medford transition fair.

137
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:42,478
So on Saturday, October 7, please join the Medford community at Brooks Elementary School to learn about resources for those with disabilities.

138
00:24:43,238 --> 00:25:00,635
This event hosted by the city of Medford commission for persons with disabilities will highlight resources and opportunities for participation, education, employment and public and private services in the city of Medford for individuals with disabilities.

139
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:07,362
Also, save the date, Wednesday, March 20, 2024.

140
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:23,119
That is when the Medford and Malden Public Schools will join together for a transition fair to provide students, families, guardians, and professionals with information about community-based services for adults with disabilities.

141
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:38,057
Under the Department of Athletics, we have a lot of good news to share girls varsity cross country is in the midst of a for me winning streak undefeated so far this season.

142
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:46,384
The boys golf team won their most recent meet handily playing against Everett.

143
00:25:47,364 --> 00:25:51,005
Boys and girls soccer have been busy with schedules.

144
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:58,347
And I wanna just say kudos to our boys and girls junior varsity team, which won their most recent matchups.

145
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:07,790
Middle school boys baseball is also playing a very busy schedule with a notable nail biter win nine to eight over Everett last week.

146
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:17,719
Our middle school girls softball team continued their undefeated winning spree in games last week against Everett and Malden.

147
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:27,228
Congratulations to all of our student athletes and coaches for their efforts, good sportsmanship, and love for the game.

148
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:29,370
As always, go Mustangs.

149
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:37,477
This week, Wednesday, October 4 is our unified basketball season kickoff.

150
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:41,721
It's at Medford High School in the gymnasium at 4pm.

151
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:45,385
All are invited on Thursday, October 5.

152
00:26:46,926 --> 00:27:03,962
It's the unveiling of our rainbow mosaic at Medford High School, right on the side of where our Medford family network is by the purple door that will take place at 3pm, all are invited Monday, October 9, again there's no school.

153
00:27:05,383 --> 00:27:10,307
and other events will be included in my weekly update this Friday.

154
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:16,631
So for tonight's meeting, I just want to frame what you will see this evening and hear this evening.

155
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:31,863
There will be a recommendation to approve generous donations to the Medford Public Schools, public private partnerships between our schools and the wider community make an immeasurable difference for our students,

156
00:27:32,643 --> 00:27:36,786
providing resources and opportunities which might otherwise be out of reach.

157
00:27:37,487 --> 00:27:41,650
We are incredibly grateful for the generosity of this community.

158
00:27:42,822 --> 00:27:47,405
Next, we look forward to welcoming Medford's own CPAC this evening.

159
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:54,570
Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council will be presenting their interview report.

160
00:27:56,111 --> 00:28:01,454
Working closely with our special educators and our Director of Student Services, Ms.

161
00:28:01,495 --> 00:28:10,000
Bowen, CPAC is an important bridge between our schools and families of children with special education needs.

162
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:12,162
CPAC's advisory

163
00:28:13,102 --> 00:28:25,548
CPAC's advocacy and educational roles ensure that Medford parents can productively and proactively engage in the education and development of their children with disabilities.

164
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:30,971
This evening, the presentations will take place with Ms.

165
00:28:31,952 --> 00:28:37,755
Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lorick, who will be the joint co-chairs of Medford CPAC.

166
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:40,416
So we look forward to your presentation this evening.

167
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:41,777
Thank you for coming out.

168
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:44,879
After our CPAC presentation, Ms.

169
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:53,005
Bowen is going to provide an update on the implementation process of the district's bullying prevention and intervention plan.

170
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:54,447
I want to thank Ms.

171
00:28:54,467 --> 00:29:01,312
Bowen and our school principals and administrators for their work in implementing this important new policy.

172
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:05,135
which this committee finalized earlier this year.

173
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:17,462
We're eagerly anticipating upcoming professional development opportunities for all of our teachers to ensure that this policy reaches the entire Medford Public Schools community.

174
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:31,210
While we're discussing school climate and safety, I wanna pivot and provide a brief presentation on the results from last year's Medford High School Culture and Climate Survey.

175
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:46,217
I also will discuss in my presentation a snapshot in time, which I hope we can utilize as a benchmark and point of comparison against future student-oriented surveys and feedback.

176
00:29:47,157 --> 00:30:03,548
And lastly, I look forward to presenting to the committee this year, my proposed goals for this school year, and to share an update on this school committee's goals, the first set of goals that they have created as a body.

177
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,970
So I look forward to providing an update on that.

178
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:09,733
And those will be my reports for today.

179
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:10,233
Thank you.

180
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,230
Thank you.

181
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:27,236
Up next, we have an approval of an educational funds donation from the Italian consulate to our world language department in the amount of 4,493 euros, which is $4,758 as of today.

182
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:34,699
And we'll hear from Dr. Vilma Bibbo, the coordinator of world language, who is joining us on Zoom.

183
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,079
Dr. Bibbo.

184
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:37,019
Good evening.

185
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,920
Can you hear me?

186
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,560
Yes.

187
00:30:40,281 --> 00:30:40,721
Yes, we can.

188
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,722
So good evening there members of the school committee, Dr. Edward Vincent and Mayor Longo Ken.

189
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:59,127
I am very pleased to announce that the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in collaboration with the Italian Consulate in Boston has granted us a fund of totaling $4,493.

190
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:10,251
This grant will serve as an invaluable support for our ongoing efforts to support the Italian program here in Medford.

191
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:17,900
At the beginning of this academic year, I submitted an application for this grant, which has now been successfully approved.

192
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:25,663
And looking ahead, I hope to continue applying for this grant in the upcoming year, provided the funds remain available.

193
00:31:26,923 --> 00:31:34,226
Again, this financial support has the potential to greatly enhance our Italian program and benefit our students in numerous ways.

194
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:41,208
Thank you for your attention and support in our endeavor to promote Italian language and culture in Medford schools.

195
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:43,773
Thank you.

196
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,057
Are there any questions from the committee?

197
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:52,679
Is there a recommendation to approve?

198
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:55,561
Motion to approve.

199
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:56,302
No.

200
00:31:57,943 --> 00:31:58,243
Second.

201
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,964
Seconded by member Kratz.

202
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:00,965
Roll call.

203
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:03,607
Member Graham.

204
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:04,127
Yes.

205
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:05,288
Member Hayes.

206
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:05,868
Yes.

207
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:06,749
Member Kratz.

208
00:32:06,949 --> 00:32:07,169
Yes.

209
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,250
Member McLaughlin.

210
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,190
Yes.

211
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:10,211
Member Stone.

212
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:11,652
Yes.

213
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:12,497
members.

214
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:13,818
So yes, Maryland occur.

215
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:14,479
Yes.

216
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:17,903
seven in the affirmative zero in the negative.

217
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:20,547
The donation has been accepted.

218
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:26,935
If we could please send a thank you note to the consulate on behalf of the school committee.

219
00:32:26,975 --> 00:32:28,316
That would be great.

220
00:32:29,057 --> 00:32:29,878
Thank you.

221
00:32:29,918 --> 00:32:30,319
Well done.

222
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,040
Thank you very much.

223
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:47,363
Okay, item number three, we have a recommendation to approve a donation from a private donor of office furniture and fixtures, including two refrigerators, two microwaves, a toaster oven, a conference room table, conference speaker phones valued in excess of $14,000.

224
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:52,466
Dr. Cushing, did you have anything more you wanted to add?

225
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:57,309
No, I just want to thank member Graham for connecting us with this organization that would like to remain anonymous.

226
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:07,746
I also want to thank Sean Lally, John Howard, Mike Lazaro, Mark Murphy from our custodial team, and John Bissell and Tom Long for the work that they've done to move it and reassemble the various items.

227
00:33:08,126 --> 00:33:08,867
So thank you.

228
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:10,168
Thank you.

229
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:13,170
That table was a beast, so it did take all of those people.

230
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,593
And there's a motion to approve on the floor by Member McStone, seconded by Member Laughlin.

231
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:19,294
Roll call.

232
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:24,941
Yes.

233
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:25,641
Yes.

234
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:26,122
Yes.

235
00:33:26,282 --> 00:33:26,742
Yes.

236
00:33:26,943 --> 00:33:28,123
Yes.

237
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:29,545
Yes.

238
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:30,405
Yes.

239
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:30,786
Yes.

240
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:31,486
Yes.

241
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:32,087
Yes.

242
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:36,610
Seven in the affirmative zero in the negative, the donation is approved.

243
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:43,596
Item number four we have the special education parent advisory council end of your report for the school year 2022 and 2023.

244
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:49,981
This Tanya Sullivan and Miss Alex Clark, who are the co chairs of the medical feedback.

245
00:33:54,889 --> 00:34:01,451
Good evening, mayor, school committee members, superintendent, and everyone else.

246
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:05,112
Thank you for allowing us to present tonight.

247
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:21,657
We just wanted to kind of give a brief synopsis of what's happened in this past year and some of the things that we are trying to move forward and some of the things that we're interested in starting fresh to move forward as well.

248
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:24,738
The CPAC board members are myself,

249
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,193
and Alex Lorak are the co-chairs.

250
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:32,335
Anne Herzog-Rousseau is our secretary, and Jamelian Johnson is our treasurer.

251
00:34:34,035 --> 00:34:39,556
Our membership includes students, families, and guardians of children on IEPs and other interested parties.

252
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:50,799
The CPAC is always looking for interested parents and guardians of children with special needs and any other interested parties, which could be students or anyone in the community that has an interest.

253
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,400
If you would like to learn more about how to get involved with the Medford CPAC,

254
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:58,719
you can email us at medford.cpac at gmail.com.

255
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:00,199
And we would love to hear from you.

256
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,740
Our mission, what is CPAC?

257
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:19,442
The CPAC's purpose is to fulfill the directive stated in Chapter 71B of the Massachusetts General Laws, which requires a school district to establish a PAC and assigns both an advisory and a participatory function to the PAC.

258
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,963
So in meeting the requirement, the mission of the CPAC

259
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:35,173
is to advise the district on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with disabilities by seeking input from special education parent members, guardians.

260
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:39,294
We meet regularly with the school officials every month.

261
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:52,218
We participate in the planning, development and evaluation of the school district's special education program and participate in planning workshops and activities as prioritized by the CPAC board.

262
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:57,779
Some of the highlights from our 2022-2023 school year.

263
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:07,904
We offered several content rich presentations throughout the year and our presentations typically qualify as PDPs for teachers and staff.

264
00:36:08,004 --> 00:36:15,167
So it's really nice to have kind of a well-rounded participation, including everybody.

265
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:20,110
We did offer a meet the central and special education administrators.

266
00:36:21,124 --> 00:36:44,967
We offered a presentation on CVI, which is cortical visual impairment, basic rights from the Federation for Children with Special Needs on comprehensive introduction to special ed laws and procedures, transition documents made easy, special needs trusts, IEP writing strategies, and understanding and managing anxiety in your neurodiverse child.

267
00:36:48,857 --> 00:36:57,323
So the CPAC concerns and recommendations, this is the page that we are most interested in sharing with you.

268
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:10,092
So at our last presentation on May 2022, CPAC brought before the school committee the issue of disciplinary referrals and incident reports added to a student file without parental notification.

269
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:16,276
These policies have the potential to disproportionately impact students with high needs and their families.

270
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:27,405
We appreciate the work that was already done and the work that's currently underway to strengthen our discipline policies and introduce unambiguous language regarding parental notifications.

271
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:38,254
CPAC is focused on moving forward the disability awareness training for staff and the disability awareness curriculum for students in all schools.

272
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:41,857
This is an ongoing CPAC concern and recommendation.

273
00:37:42,674 --> 00:38:01,783
Despite continuous discussions, the formation of the special education subcommittee in August of 2018 and a pre-pandemic year long focus on establishing a disability awareness program, the school committee and district has yet to commit to identifying and implementing a disability curriculum for students in Medford.

274
00:38:02,544 --> 00:38:11,208
Despite a pilot started during school year 21 to 22, there is currently no plan to implement a disability awareness curriculum for students in our school.

275
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:20,537
An additional CPAC initiative moving forward will be working toward an adaptive health education for our students with disabilities.

276
00:38:21,378 --> 00:38:34,760
Students with intellectual and developmental disabilities in particular need to learn about healthy relationships, recognizing abuse, consent, and sex education using lessons and materials that are adapted to their level of comprehension.

277
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:43,382
Currently, wellness classes are very large, prohibiting participation for students who might not be competent learners and making it hard for teachers to reach

278
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:45,164
individual student needs.

279
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:55,090
And another item that we are really wanting to move forward is the Thrive Act.

280
00:38:55,891 --> 00:39:05,117
This calls for an end to MCAS as a graduation requirement and to establish a graduation requirement based on coursework rather than the standardized testing.

281
00:39:05,997 --> 00:39:10,540
While the MCAS assessments and reporting will be maintained for accountability requirements

282
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:21,984
The Thrive Act would end high-stakes testing as a condition of graduation, which affects disproportionately high-needs students, including minorities, English learners, and students with disabilities.

283
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:35,895
On September 11, 2023, Malden School Committee voted a resolution in support of the Thrive Act, and we are asking the school committee to consider supporting the Thrive Act for the benefit of all students of Medford.

284
00:39:38,968 --> 00:39:41,209
and we'll take questions if there are any.

285
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:46,230
Are there questions for the CPAC folks?

286
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,070
Yes.

287
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,470
Member McLaughlin.

288
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:50,971
Thank you.

289
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:52,631
Member Kretz, I think you had your light.

290
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:56,352
I think I forgot to shut my light on.

291
00:39:56,592 --> 00:39:56,852
Sorry.

292
00:39:57,172 --> 00:39:59,552
I don't have any questions, but thank you very much for the presentation.

293
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:05,154
And I always appreciate hearing from you with your updates and all your meeting and communication.

294
00:40:05,214 --> 00:40:06,014
It's always wonderful.

295
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:06,674
Thank you.

296
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:09,553
Member McLaughlin?

297
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,234
Yeah, thank you for all you guys do.

298
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:12,094
We really appreciate it.

299
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:34,560
I also want to make sure that families that are listening or that watch later on understand that CPAC is available for families and for individuals, for people to consult with, to have parent-to-parent sort of peer program mentoring around how to navigate school districts, navigate school systems, in addition to sort of the regulatory requirements.

300
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,401
I know that you guys spend a lot of time

301
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:44,265
talking to families on the phone about how to support them and how to help them and build relationships with the school district.

302
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:46,226
So super appreciative of that as well.

303
00:40:47,087 --> 00:41:03,177
Questions I had were, so as part of the mandate, the legal mandate for districts to have a special education parent advisory council, one of the items that was mentioned would participate in the planning development

304
00:41:03,806 --> 00:41:07,129
and evaluation of the school district special education programs.

305
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:10,151
And I'm wondering, has that actually happened?

306
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:20,920
I know that last year there was a discussion that there would be a tour, that the CPAC would have a tour to understand the programs and what the programming is, and if there's gonna be any changes in programming.

307
00:41:23,863 --> 00:41:24,023
Ms.

308
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:27,926
Bowen, I know that that's been a discussion as well, and I'm wondering if this is anything that's

309
00:41:28,356 --> 00:41:30,838
been happening with CPAC in the district?

310
00:41:30,998 --> 00:41:34,200
There has not been like a tour solidified as of yet.

311
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,042
That is still on our agenda to do with the school district.

312
00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:43,526
We actually just had our first in-person CPAC meeting recently.

313
00:41:43,986 --> 00:41:56,654
So kind of getting back into getting out there and into the community and with administration to kind of see what those programs look like, what's working, what can be improved.

314
00:41:57,421 --> 00:41:58,361
Yeah, I think that would be great.

315
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:03,382
And I don't know how many of my colleagues here understand the different programs within the special education department.

316
00:42:03,402 --> 00:42:04,623
Do you guys, anybody?

317
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:11,104
Not like what different programs are, what the structure of the special ed programming is?

318
00:42:11,124 --> 00:42:18,065
No, not for which schools, but within the schools, how the learning programs are structured.

319
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:25,187
So what the differences between language-based classroom or connections program or access or any of those programming.

320
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:33,919
So that's the sort of programming that we're talking about and how those are working or not working, what they look like building wise, you know, how materials being differentiated.

321
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:41,525
So access students or students or classrooms where students have significantly modified materials.

322
00:42:41,585 --> 00:42:44,768
And so that's one of the issues that were being discussed around the health care.

323
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,592
I mean, the health and wellness program for differentiation of materials.

324
00:42:50,748 --> 00:43:01,651
Part of what we talked about a lot in our strategic plan has been equity, and I'm wondering how we're actually addressing the issues of equity when we're talking about new curriculum, in particular, the healthcare curriculum.

325
00:43:03,151 --> 00:43:07,113
And I know that one of you guys was on the healthcare advisory.

326
00:43:07,373 --> 00:43:10,473
Do you mind telling us, introducing yourself?

327
00:43:11,994 --> 00:43:15,775
Hi, so I'm Anne Herzog-Rousseau, and it is weird to hear your name.

328
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:18,665
I kept hearing your name, I'm like, ooh.

329
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:20,307
And I knew you reacted when you heard mine.

330
00:43:21,047 --> 00:43:21,928
We're not related, but.

331
00:43:24,149 --> 00:43:28,452
So I was part of the health education curriculum review.

332
00:43:29,413 --> 00:43:35,017
We didn't talk a lot about differentiated education in that.

333
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,178
We covered a lot of ground.

334
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:45,724
I personally am a parent of a significantly disabled 13-year-old child who's physically developing quite well.

335
00:43:46,738 --> 00:43:51,319
So that's actually one of the reasons why I chose to be part of that committee.

336
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:55,760
I would- You're also a nurse practitioner.

337
00:43:56,141 --> 00:43:58,521
Yes, by trade, I'm a nurse practitioner.

338
00:44:01,122 --> 00:44:08,224
I can tell you if we have a dearth of lesson plans that are differentiated, we are not alone.

339
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:12,505
I know one of the big initiatives was comprehensive sex ed.

340
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:19,640
Happen to work in college health for the last 18 years and have done my share of sex ed to college health people.

341
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:22,563
And it's very important.

342
00:44:22,603 --> 00:44:30,872
And I was very much I am driven to to support comprehensive sex education, my impression.

343
00:44:30,932 --> 00:44:32,053
And again, it's my impression.

344
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:36,277
So bear with me was that as a district, we are just getting there.

345
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:37,058
And so

346
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:46,927
I do ultimately want to have differentiated sex, comprehensive sex education, but I think just getting it into the system is where we're at right now.

347
00:44:47,127 --> 00:44:48,208
Does that answer your question?

348
00:44:48,508 --> 00:44:49,028
I think so.

349
00:44:49,348 --> 00:45:05,058
But I think that what I'm hearing in terms of the wellness classes, that they're very large and that students with disabilities aren't really accessing the material that's currently there because of the size of the classroom and the access to the material.

350
00:45:05,098 --> 00:45:05,779
I don't know if Ms.

351
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:07,400
Bowen can speak to this or if anyone else has

352
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:09,677
direct experience that they want to speak to that.

353
00:45:09,717 --> 00:45:31,458
But this is a concern and an ongoing concern, if I may, for the district in not only my opinion, but the experiences of, you know, we have 20% of our students are on IEPs or 504s, significant portion of our population that we're potentially not addressing if we're not addressing equity around curriculum for them.

354
00:45:33,123 --> 00:45:33,303
Sure.

355
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:37,844
So I just want to say that part of the concern that we put forth... Can you... To the microphone.

356
00:45:37,864 --> 00:45:38,084
Sorry.

357
00:45:38,424 --> 00:45:40,485
So it's kind of like a twofold concern.

358
00:45:41,045 --> 00:45:47,426
One is how students on IEP access that go into the general education and are including in wellness.

359
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:48,947
How do they access that curriculum?

360
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:51,227
Is it modified by the teacher?

361
00:45:51,267 --> 00:45:52,328
But it's not only that question.

362
00:45:52,348 --> 00:46:00,649
Does our current curriculum lend itself to being modified actually in a way that can be accessed by students with disabilities?

363
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,050
That's one of the questions.

364
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:02,710
The other question is,

365
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,762
What happens with the students who are not included in the gen ed?

366
00:46:06,822 --> 00:46:09,644
How are they accessing in special education programs?

367
00:46:09,664 --> 00:46:12,186
How are they accessing this information?

368
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:19,151
And... Yes, I think one of the questions too was opting out.

369
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:24,814
So what do the special education students who aren't accessing the wellness class, what happens?

370
00:46:25,195 --> 00:46:30,318
So we had our first CPAC admin meeting and we brought this up as a discussion.

371
00:46:30,805 --> 00:46:34,869
I have brought it to the superintendent and the assistant superintendent.

372
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:41,375
We're looking at different curriculums that are out there for students with disabilities that are already differentiated for them.

373
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:45,198
So it's a work in progress.

374
00:46:45,238 --> 00:46:50,743
We're starting these discussions, but I think it's very important to look at what can we implement within the district.

375
00:46:51,164 --> 00:46:56,749
So is there a specific curriculum that we purchase for our students with disabilities?

376
00:46:57,128 --> 00:46:59,469
and what does that look like for instruction?

377
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:01,730
So we're at the beginning phases right now.

378
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,171
The health classes are smaller.

379
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:07,932
It's our PE classes that have a larger number of students in them.

380
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:14,295
But this is a discussion that we're having about that and going forward, what we can put into place.

381
00:47:14,675 --> 00:47:17,516
Because we have adaptive PE, but we don't have adaptive health.

382
00:47:17,616 --> 00:47:18,157
Is that right?

383
00:47:18,237 --> 00:47:18,617
Correct.

384
00:47:19,177 --> 00:47:19,397
Okay.

385
00:47:20,057 --> 00:47:21,798
So may I, Mayor, Member Graham?

386
00:47:21,818 --> 00:47:23,019
So

387
00:47:24,867 --> 00:47:30,989
Okay, so this is all information gathering, sort of understanding a little bit better at this point, how we're addressing these issues.

388
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:44,172
And then regarding the disability awareness curriculum for staff and for students, if I remember correctly, that was part of our strategic plan as well as a district as a whole.

389
00:47:44,753 --> 00:47:49,994
So the other thing I just sort of want to mention too, specifically for my colleagues to consider is as we're talking about

390
00:47:51,098 --> 00:48:05,409
students, all students obviously are general education students, some students receive special education supports and services, some students receive English learner services, what have you, but everybody is a student of equal value, of course, in our schools.

391
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:13,415
And as we're thinking about how this applies to students with disabilities, I want us to really be thinking about how it applies to our other populations as well.

392
00:48:13,915 --> 00:48:18,899
Because if it's not addressing this particular population, perhaps it's not addressing other populations.

393
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:22,072
English learners, for example, other populations.

394
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:27,213
So I know that that's not the presentation tonight, but I'm just asking people to also be mindful of that.

395
00:48:28,274 --> 00:48:41,477
So toward that end around the disability awareness curriculum, both for staff and for students, I understand historically there was a curriculum that was created.

396
00:48:41,557 --> 00:48:42,538
Is that right, Ms.

397
00:48:42,558 --> 00:48:42,838
Bowen?

398
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:44,018
I believe so.

399
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:49,694
There was, I think it was piloted pilot kindergarten or first grade, I believe, so.

400
00:48:51,976 --> 00:49:02,605
The implementation of a district wide disability awareness curriculum for students, it is part of the district strategic plan, it is under the equity initiatives it's one of the initiatives.

401
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:05,471
and it's attached with very specific benchmarks.

402
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:13,676
One of the benchmarks for the year 21-22 was to create a pilot for grades K and one, and that happened as far as I know.

403
00:49:14,296 --> 00:49:27,625
And then for the next year, 22-23, that pilot was supposed to be deployed to all K and one, K and grade one classes district wide, and an additional pilot done for grades two and third.

404
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:29,146
So this did not happen.

405
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:36,325
Is there a reason that that didn't happen?

406
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:40,769
I just feel like there was, I don't have an excuse as to why it didn't happen.

407
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:50,037
We had tried to get people to be involved and with our disability awareness workshop that we have, we've had like really low enrollment.

408
00:49:50,397 --> 00:49:53,019
So we are trying to promote this to get it started.

409
00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:00,185
I have had a conversation with the new principal in the district who they rolled out a disability awareness curriculum

410
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:07,449
So I'm reaching out to her to see what that specific curriculum was and what the implementation would be.

411
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:14,570
Yeah, and I think the data is really interesting because I believe Susanna Campbell was sort of leading a lot of this and it's having a leader that really cares about it too, right?

412
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:15,871
Like, not that you don't, Ms.

413
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:21,012
Bowen, but I think you have a lot of things, a lot of, you know, things that you're having to work on.

414
00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:25,832
So I think it's having a leader that really is working on the implementation of this.

415
00:50:25,872 --> 00:50:28,733
And I know that the numbers for the disability awareness

416
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:32,393
program for staff, the training, because it's not required.

417
00:50:32,553 --> 00:50:33,855
They do get PDP, right?

418
00:50:34,016 --> 00:50:34,296
Correct.

419
00:50:34,356 --> 00:50:35,337
For participating in it.

420
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:37,721
Previously, there had been as many as 40.

421
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:42,447
I've been to ones where there were 40 or more, and it's gone down to something like 10.

422
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:43,969
Correct.

423
00:50:44,069 --> 00:50:46,513
Which is pretty substantial decline in one year.

424
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:50,636
Well, we've offered it several times, but the enrollment has been a lot lower.

425
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,717
So we haven't been able to run the program.

426
00:50:52,737 --> 00:50:52,998
Yeah.

427
00:50:53,758 --> 00:51:07,809
So I'm curious from a from a central administration perspective, why that is and what what can be looked at, not just from you, but from all of our central administration, because if we're going to say equity is a priority, and we're going to put it in our strategic plan that I think we really have to act on it.

428
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:09,330
And that's not happening.

429
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,652
And I want to make sure that we're

430
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:15,003
ensuring that it is in any way that we can help make that happen.

431
00:51:15,684 --> 00:51:24,128
And the awareness program that's existing now is for staff, but it's not the curriculum in the school for the students, which was the other piece of it.

432
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:24,848
Is that accurate?

433
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:35,894
So one of the issues is that we are considering this and we are thinking about it as a special education issue, the disability awareness for students.

434
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:37,595
And I don't think it's a special education issue.

435
00:51:37,615 --> 00:51:38,755
It's a general education issue.

436
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:39,055
Yes.

437
00:51:39,235 --> 00:51:40,316
And it's a curriculum issue.

438
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:44,954
And it needs to be part of the ELA curriculum or the social studies, because if it's Ms.

439
00:51:44,974 --> 00:51:51,818
Bowen who's putting forth a curriculum, there is just not a piece of work that we are asking our teachers to take on.

440
00:51:52,179 --> 00:52:01,625
And I think this is why we are failing in moving this disability awareness curriculum for students specifically, is because we are not thinking of it as general education.

441
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:03,966
Thank you.

442
00:52:03,986 --> 00:52:05,027
Well, that's really helpful.

443
00:52:05,427 --> 00:52:09,350
So how would you, what would you recommend for next steps for

444
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:10,843
the school committee.

445
00:52:10,863 --> 00:52:15,966
I mean, concretely, I understood you wanted us to think about the Thrive Act.

446
00:52:16,106 --> 00:52:22,129
And, you know, I would, I'll get to that in a moment about making a motion maybe for the subcommittee.

447
00:52:22,149 --> 00:52:27,052
But so to look at the Thrive Act, is that as a consideration?

448
00:52:27,652 --> 00:52:33,955
And then you're asking us for next steps to look at adaptive health education.

449
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:34,035
And

450
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:41,886
Yeah, we are asking questions now and kind of hoping to work with the district in getting answers to the questions.

451
00:52:41,946 --> 00:52:49,232
So maybe making this a subject of the special education school committee would be a good idea.

452
00:52:49,452 --> 00:52:56,498
And then we are certainly hoping that the disability awareness group will move on as part of the plan.

453
00:52:56,658 --> 00:53:00,642
I mean, it was voted by the school committee and we're hoping that's gonna happen.

454
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:04,105
Yeah, I'm wondering, thank you.

455
00:53:04,602 --> 00:53:04,922
Thank you.

456
00:53:05,603 --> 00:53:25,737
So I would make a motion that we have a, at least specifically to the disability subcommittee that we bring the issues, the three issues that are being recommended for the recommendations to the diversity, equity and inclusion and behavioral health, sorry, not the diversity, equity and inclusion, the special education and behavioral health subcommittee.

457
00:53:25,757 --> 00:53:27,798
Give me a second.

458
00:53:29,645 --> 00:53:40,720
So there's a motion on the floor to bring the three items outlined in the CPAC's concerns and recommendations slide to the Special Education Subcommittee by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hayes.

459
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:42,422
Roll call.

460
00:53:53,206 --> 00:53:53,686
Member Graham?

461
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:54,367
Yes.

462
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:55,247
Member Hayes?

463
00:53:55,548 --> 00:53:55,768
Yes.

464
00:53:55,908 --> 00:53:56,428
Member Kress?

465
00:53:56,848 --> 00:53:57,069
Yes.

466
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:58,089
Member McLaughlin?

467
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:58,790
Yes.

468
00:53:59,030 --> 00:53:59,690
Member McStone?

469
00:53:59,951 --> 00:54:00,151
Yes.

470
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:01,071
Member Hussow?

471
00:54:01,191 --> 00:54:01,432
Yes.

472
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:02,252
Mayor Longo?

473
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:03,313
Yes.

474
00:54:05,014 --> 00:54:06,735
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

475
00:54:07,315 --> 00:54:09,817
Those three items have been referred to subcommittee.

476
00:54:11,939 --> 00:54:22,966
Are there other questions and comments from the school committee before we let the CPAC get on to the exciting part of their, the more exciting, most exciting part of their presentation?

477
00:54:23,951 --> 00:54:25,152
Are there other questions, comments?

478
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:29,355
Thank you all very much.

479
00:54:30,196 --> 00:54:30,876
So the floor is yours.

480
00:54:31,217 --> 00:54:31,577
Thank you.

481
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:43,246
So every year, the CPAC awards presents an award to members in the community who for the current school year have embodied what it means to go above and beyond for our students and families.

482
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,308
And we have two recipients.

483
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:49,331
We'd like to have Charlotte Heim.

484
00:55:01,488 --> 00:55:13,471
And CPAC recognizes Charlotte Heim, Occupational Therapist, Transition Specialist at Medford High Schools, and unicorn, because you do way more than just that, for so many years.

485
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:27,735
Charlotte's been working with our most vulnerable students to smooth their transition from middle school to high school, help them succeed in high school, and then get them ready for their next adventures beyond high school, working on skills for independent living and career readiness.

486
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:40,877
Collaborating with neighborhood districts, Charlotte is always gathering resources for students and families, demystifying the complexity of transitioning to adult services and providing support in a time of much anxiety.

487
00:55:41,197 --> 00:55:46,600
So thank you, Charlotte, for everything that you do.

488
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:11,145
Our second recipient... And this time, please don't leave.

489
00:56:11,185 --> 00:56:14,826
We would like to take a picture with everybody as soon as we're done.

490
00:56:16,047 --> 00:56:18,368
Our second recipient is Anthony Petrellis.

491
00:56:27,912 --> 00:56:32,474
We also recognize Anthony Petrellis for his leadership at Medford Summer Fun Camp.

492
00:56:33,277 --> 00:56:39,219
and honor his children as well, so cute, which functioned under his guidance for several years.

493
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:45,600
Finding good camps is challenging for every family, but for families with children with special needs, it's almost impossible.

494
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:52,082
We are so grateful that such a great program, which is truly available to all families, exists in our city.

495
00:56:53,002 --> 00:57:02,425
Building on his extensive teaching experience as a fifth year teacher at McGlynn Elementary School, Anthony has created at Summer Fund something that is unfortunately still rare,

496
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:12,895
a genuinely inclusive environment in which all children thrive, make friends, and want to come back year after year to camp.

497
00:57:13,655 --> 00:57:17,979
Thank you, Anthony.

498
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,060
Thanks, guys.

499
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:21,662
Thank you.

500
00:57:21,682 --> 00:57:24,744
All right, so now we get to do pictures.

501
00:57:27,867 --> 00:57:32,030
And then can everyone come up here and we'll take a picture with the entire committee?

502
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:40,140
All right, everyone look at me real quick.

503
00:58:41,482 --> 00:58:42,303
On three.

504
00:58:42,323 --> 00:58:43,265
One, two, three.

505
00:58:43,285 --> 00:58:44,206
And one more.

506
00:58:44,467 --> 00:58:45,548
One, two, three.

507
00:58:45,708 --> 00:58:46,049
Thank you.

508
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:26,078
Okay, up next, we have item number five, an update on the bullying prevention plan and implementation.

509
00:59:26,118 --> 00:59:26,299
Ms.

510
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:28,299
Joan Bowen, the director of student services.

511
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,360
Good evening.

512
00:59:31,961 --> 00:59:38,943
So tonight, I'm here to present an update regarding the bullying intervention and prevention plan throughout the district.

513
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:47,287
The following is a timeline activities that have been completed since the revised, I don't have a PowerPoint, it's just a report.

514
00:59:48,914 --> 00:59:58,500
So after the revised plan was approved in July 19th, we met with our district administrators during the administrative week.

515
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:05,604
We provided them with all the documents and asked them to review them for a second meeting that we had in September.

516
01:00:05,624 --> 01:00:07,705
And this was a district-wide meeting.

517
01:00:08,165 --> 01:00:09,366
We went through the plan.

518
01:00:09,466 --> 01:00:11,467
We went through the necessary documents.

519
01:00:12,367 --> 01:00:13,388
It was fully,

520
01:00:15,707 --> 01:00:19,350
All the administrators were present for this, for this day.

521
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:32,320
The next steps in regards to the bullying intervention and prevention plan is by October 15, the building principals are to present the plan to their staff, and to go through

522
01:00:33,749 --> 01:00:39,252
the reporting forms and what needs to be done in the process so it's consistent across the district.

523
01:00:40,193 --> 01:00:48,717
November 7th is our district-wide professional development day, and there will be a morning session that we will be reviewing.

524
01:00:48,737 --> 01:00:56,481
There'll be a presentation from Mass Partnerships for Youth regarding bullying, and that will be from eight to 1030 on that morning.

525
01:00:56,501 --> 01:01:00,804
And then November 14th, we'll be doing a parent presentation

526
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:08,268
We've been able to identify Elizabeth Englander and she will be presenting.

527
01:01:08,388 --> 01:01:15,112
She's what we consider the guru in regards to bullying intervention and prevention and her presentations to parents.

528
01:01:15,712 --> 01:01:21,555
And we are doing this with the, in collaboration with the city of Medford's office of prevention and outreach.

529
01:01:21,995 --> 01:01:28,919
Dr. Cushing and I met with them last week and they are funding her to come and speak to all the

530
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:29,699
the parents.

531
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:30,960
So that will be via Zoom.

532
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,681
We will send out all the information.

533
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:39,646
We will have it widely distributed and advertised so as many people that can attend as possible.

534
01:01:40,847 --> 01:01:57,678
And then in addition, I've created a Google Drive that has all of the necessary documents for easy access for all of our administrators, as well as a tracking form so we can track how many bullying reports came into the district, what the findings were,

535
01:01:58,188 --> 01:02:03,130
and what the outcome was, because we have to report this to DESE at the end of every school year.

536
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:06,171
So that's the update up to this point.

537
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:09,812
If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

538
01:02:11,313 --> 01:02:12,053
Member McLaughlin.

539
01:02:14,954 --> 01:02:15,415
Thank you.

540
01:02:16,395 --> 01:02:17,395
Thank you for the presentation.

541
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:18,636
I have a couple of questions.

542
01:02:18,796 --> 01:02:21,377
One is, and thank you for all the work.

543
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:22,597
I know that this has been a lot of work.

544
01:02:24,118 --> 01:02:25,959
One is for the October 15th,

545
01:02:28,357 --> 01:02:31,299
principal review with the staff.

546
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:38,424
Can we ensure that there's also the understanding of the incident reports in that presentation?

547
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:44,228
Yes, that was part of their presentation about notifying parents in a timely manner if there's an incident report.

548
01:02:44,268 --> 01:02:45,569
Yes, thank you.

549
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:47,930
And any behavior incident reports.

550
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,791
Correct.

551
01:02:48,911 --> 01:02:49,251
Thank you.

552
01:02:50,252 --> 01:02:53,534
And then for the November 14th presentation,

553
01:02:55,928 --> 01:03:07,997
And I don't know that it's been considered yet, but I would love for folks to consider it, or I would ask that folks consider it, and I'm happy to help in any way I can, if I can, that there's interpretation provided.

554
01:03:08,737 --> 01:03:12,960
So I'm working, I will be working with Paul Teixeira to see what's available.

555
01:03:15,502 --> 01:03:18,504
We have to get a look at what the presentation is going to be ahead of time.

556
01:03:20,236 --> 01:03:27,362
So we're trying to work out the logistics of how that would work but all the documents are on the Met for public school website and they are translated.

557
01:03:28,283 --> 01:03:29,804
That's, that's good if we can offer.

558
01:03:29,944 --> 01:03:43,336
If, if, sorry, excuse me if the Federation for children with special needs can offer support around the interpretation just in terms of advice or anything that in terms of what they do for breakout rooms or headsets or.

559
01:03:43,775 --> 01:03:47,976
any of those things, they're happy to offer that service to any school district.

560
01:03:48,476 --> 01:03:54,097
Just to let folks know what they do, because they have multiple translations, interpretations, I mean, going on all the time.

561
01:03:54,557 --> 01:04:07,240
I do think it's one thing to have the material on the website and another all together to be inclusive and have it presented to families from all walks in our district, especially as we're looking at the climate report shortly.

562
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,741
And we see some of the feedback on the data there.

563
01:04:09,881 --> 01:04:11,441
So yeah, thank you.

564
01:04:13,689 --> 01:04:14,970
Other questions?

565
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:19,092
I just had a couple of questions from the chair, if I might.

566
01:04:19,232 --> 01:04:19,472
Sure.

567
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:25,956
Can we be sure to record this session on November 14th so that it can be posted?

568
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,458
And I think it will enable translation.

569
01:04:28,558 --> 01:04:39,064
So if we have a recording, it can be subtitled and translated into other languages quite simply if we have the initial recording.

570
01:04:39,284 --> 01:04:40,625
Yes, she is recording that.

571
01:04:40,705 --> 01:04:42,326
So that definitely is happening.

572
01:04:42,826 --> 01:04:43,006
Great.

573
01:04:43,933 --> 01:04:55,722
I was just curious when you reviewed this with principles, what was the feedback from them and what were the questions that they had?

574
01:04:55,742 --> 01:04:59,345
And what was the overall feeling about the work that we did?

575
01:04:59,785 --> 01:05:05,049
So I think they were pleased that the plan is very, it's a lot shorter than it was previously.

576
01:05:06,195 --> 01:05:12,196
It's a very clear, concise process that I think everyone welcomed that they can follow that process.

577
01:05:12,236 --> 01:05:16,837
And like I said, it can be consistent across all schools that this is what's happening.

578
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:26,999
And then with the tracking form, knowing that we have to keep track of any time that there's a bullying, the process that the district is gonna have.

579
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:32,461
Some of the questions were more around incident reports.

580
01:05:32,741 --> 01:05:33,881
How do we store them?

581
01:05:34,591 --> 01:05:38,833
And a question too came up about confidentiality.

582
01:05:39,193 --> 01:05:46,015
You know, what if a parent is really concerned about a bullying situation, how do we handle that?

583
01:05:46,555 --> 01:05:50,197
How do we not disclose the other, you know, the other student's name?

584
01:05:50,237 --> 01:06:01,581
And we said, you know, this is the federal law, this is what they need to follow, but offer what sort of supportive measures that we can put into place to make sure that their child is getting the support that they require.

585
01:06:02,108 --> 01:06:13,358
But there weren't many other questions beyond that, but I think they really liked the straightforward process, being able to have the forms with the QR code so they're easily accessible.

586
01:06:14,139 --> 01:06:17,962
So everyone has the links that they need to have for easy access.

587
01:06:19,363 --> 01:06:19,623
Great.

588
01:06:19,924 --> 01:06:28,031
And the other question that I had was around the use of a Google Form instead of like school brains for the tracking of all

589
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:35,452
this information, I would assume that you've previously tracked somewhere other than a Google form, but I don't know, I'm just curious.

590
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:50,524
So there is, there is the tracking ability on school brain, but this was more necessarily easier to pull from school brains that I would have, that I would be able to take a look at it and be able to help Kim Miles, who's our data manager to look at that.

591
01:06:50,564 --> 01:06:54,427
But we are looking at school brains and that may be the way to go.

592
01:06:55,592 --> 01:06:58,653
I think it's more in depth than the steps that people have to take.

593
01:06:58,693 --> 01:07:01,034
So Kim and I are going to meet to go through that.

594
01:07:01,094 --> 01:07:06,575
So we may do away with the tracking form and be able to pull that information out of the school brain system.

595
01:07:06,996 --> 01:07:08,096
So we're still looking at that.

596
01:07:08,596 --> 01:07:09,216
Okay, great.

597
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:09,676
Thank you.

598
01:07:09,977 --> 01:07:10,797
Any other questions?

599
01:07:13,178 --> 01:07:14,058
Okay, thank you.

600
01:07:14,078 --> 01:07:14,378
Thank you.

601
01:07:18,515 --> 01:07:26,560
Item number six, we have a report on Medford High School Culture and Climate Survey from school year 2022 to 2023, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

602
01:07:30,462 --> 01:07:30,902
Thank you.

603
01:07:32,663 --> 01:07:33,584
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

604
01:07:34,997 --> 01:07:48,800
We have a slide deck that I'm going to go through the slide deck this evening to discuss our results from last year's Medford High School culture and climate survey.

605
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:55,762
I want to thank member Hayes for working with me and with members of our team throughout this process.

606
01:07:57,263 --> 01:08:03,407
and helping to make sure that we were on track to present the outcomes of the Culture and Climate Survey.

607
01:08:03,907 --> 01:08:07,990
So I'm pleased to share this presentation this evening.

608
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:18,997
So this is going to be, you know, the key highlights from the Medford High School Culture and Climate Survey, which was conducted in the spring.

609
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:21,299
So on this first slide,

610
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:31,679
It's important to note that the survey questions were developed by the Medford Public Schools and in collaboration with the Medford Department of Health.

611
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:42,408
It was open to all of our high school students and the survey window was open from May 18 until June 6 of 2023.

612
01:08:46,064 --> 01:08:56,031
We had 736 students who responded to the survey, which is just over 60% of our total population.

613
01:08:56,251 --> 01:09:04,356
At that time, it was 1,222 students at the end of last year.

614
01:09:05,197 --> 01:09:10,261
Students were provided designated times during their English classes to complete the survey.

615
01:09:11,101 --> 01:09:23,371
The survey was available in Arabic, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and Spanish, which are the four most popular languages currently in the district.

616
01:09:24,872 --> 01:09:39,444
And I wanna note that these results reflect a snapshot in time from spring of 2023, and do not necessarily reflect up-to-date attitudes and perspectives on Medford High School's culture and climate.

617
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:50,632
So the survey question categories, there were eight categories that the students responded to questions.

618
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:56,817
Cultural awareness and action, diversity and inclusion.

619
01:09:57,437 --> 01:10:06,984
So under cultural awareness and action, it was how often students learn about, discuss and confront issues of race, ethnicity and culture in school.

620
01:10:08,045 --> 01:10:09,666
Under diversity and inclusion,

621
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:21,092
That address the level of diversity, integration and fairness for students of different races, ethnicities, cultures, abilities, or identities.

622
01:10:22,172 --> 01:10:28,695
School belonging addressed how much students feel that they are valued members of the school community.

623
01:10:29,715 --> 01:10:35,077
School climate was the overall social and learning climate of the school.

624
01:10:36,758 --> 01:10:37,698
School engagement

625
01:10:39,372 --> 01:11:00,851
looked at student attentiveness and investment in school school safety addressed students, physical and psychological safety within the school student teacher relationships addressed the strength of the social connections between students and teachers within and beyond the school.

626
01:11:02,072 --> 01:11:10,885
And the eighth category was valuing of school, how much students feel that school is interesting, important, and useful.

627
01:11:11,466 --> 01:11:17,855
So those were all of the categories that all of the questions fell between.

628
01:11:19,784 --> 01:11:26,572
I wanted to state that this survey is a benchmark I think it's critically important, it is not a report card.

629
01:11:27,894 --> 01:11:35,202
The responses will be most meaningful and impactful when used to measure change over time.

630
01:11:36,464 --> 01:11:50,172
We believe that the reforms, remedies, and improvements already underway at Medford High School will lead to a more favorable response in future culture and climate surveys.

631
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:59,900
So the next slide shows you how we as a district performed in the eight categories.

632
01:12:01,181 --> 01:12:03,843
Green is identified as our strengths.

633
01:12:05,825 --> 01:12:14,914
The areas where as a district we performed very well were school belonging, school engagement, and valuing of school.

634
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:30,885
The yellow area varied were areas that we had mixed results, cultural awareness and action, school safety, and student teacher relationships.

635
01:12:33,006 --> 01:12:41,189
And the area that was an area for growth, the red area, is diversity and inclusion in school climate.

636
01:12:42,749 --> 01:12:46,531
And so I'm going to share key highlights from the survey.

637
01:12:50,051 --> 01:12:50,851
Sorry, member Rousseau.

638
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:51,751
Thank you.

639
01:12:51,971 --> 01:12:58,033
I think this report is not interpreting the data correctly.

640
01:13:01,353 --> 01:13:02,874
We received the raw data as well.

641
01:13:03,554 --> 01:13:11,015
Under cultural awareness and action, the questions were students at this school are teased or picked on about their race or ethnicity.

642
01:13:12,196 --> 01:13:15,396
And 31% of our students said they agreed with that.

643
01:13:17,257 --> 01:13:18,917
So the actual

644
01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:24,573
Favorability would be 69, not 31.

645
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,696
It's more favorable that that is not true.

646
01:13:29,237 --> 01:13:29,597
Correct.

647
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:38,385
We do not want more kids teasing and picking on students about race or ethnicity.

648
01:13:38,525 --> 01:13:46,371
And the same is for the other question in that category, which says, students at this school are teased or picked on about their cultural background or religion. 7%

649
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:52,060
Sorry, point of information, I have a question.

650
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:52,901
I just have a comment.

651
01:13:52,921 --> 01:13:54,101
Point of information, Member McLaughlin.

652
01:13:54,121 --> 01:13:54,422
Thank you.

653
01:13:54,502 --> 01:14:07,429
I think it may be that I thought, the way I was reading it, Member Russo, through the chair, was that the favorable rating was whether or not it was favorably rating the school on that particular item.

654
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:11,372
That's how I saw it, not as whether the data was favorable to the question.

655
01:14:12,232 --> 01:14:15,114
So I saw it sort of like a grade, that in that question, we would be getting a 31%.

656
01:14:15,394 --> 01:14:20,017
Yeah, they agree strongly, right.

657
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:23,966
that students at the school are teased or picked on, they strongly agree.

658
01:14:23,986 --> 01:14:23,966
31%?

659
01:14:24,607 --> 01:14:26,689
Yeah, 31% strongly agree on that.

660
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:31,354
So we got a 31% as a grade on that, which is not a good grade for the school.

661
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,316
69% of our students said that is not true.

662
01:14:34,383 --> 01:14:36,104
that they're not getting teased or picked on.

663
01:14:36,304 --> 01:14:36,704
Correct.

664
01:14:37,364 --> 01:14:46,148
So whether the question is a positive or a negative, we've in this report, we've just taken the top two and given it the favorability.

665
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:56,192
If we look at the end, we have a question like, my teachers often connect what I am learning to life outside the classroom.

666
01:14:57,392 --> 01:15:01,094
And 54% of our students said that was true.

667
01:15:01,954 --> 01:15:02,634
And that's a 54% favorability.

668
01:15:04,909 --> 01:15:06,829
We want more of that, not less.

669
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:19,972
When we look at the question about the one I was just reading, we do not want more students to say that students are teased and picked on.

670
01:15:20,732 --> 01:15:23,433
So the word favorability implies that's what we want, right?

671
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:28,734
Favorability does not mean you want more of what's favorable.

672
01:15:29,974 --> 01:15:31,755
And that is listed in the red.

673
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:33,855
I think this,

674
01:15:36,001 --> 01:15:38,343
this graphic that's showing areas for growth.

675
01:15:38,403 --> 01:15:40,284
Well, first of all, everything's sort of an area for growth.

676
01:15:40,725 --> 01:15:46,189
But if you look at student strength, school belonging, the questions are in a positive.

677
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,731
So that isn't wrong.

678
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:58,660
I'm just saying that the way the questions are formulated, the data is not being interpreted based on how the question is being asked.

679
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:07,380
I mean, you ask the same question, a positive and a negative, and you get the same answers, that would be a very different and concerning thing.

680
01:16:08,621 --> 01:16:18,949
So I'm not sure that the report that you're presenting is reflected in the data that we received and it's not shown on the screen, so I apologize to the folks at home.

681
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:24,233
If I may, I would like to present

682
01:16:26,221 --> 01:16:42,414
My hope would be that I could present it and provide some of what my thinking was about the results, because even under students at the school are teased or picked on about their race or ethnicity under cultural awareness.

683
01:16:44,755 --> 01:16:49,899
Even the fact that 30% actually feel like they're being teased.

684
01:16:50,959 --> 01:16:53,340
and picked on because of their race and ethnicity.

685
01:16:53,520 --> 01:17:09,644
And if you think about the totality of the district, and if it's 60, 40, and if 30, if 30% potentially of the 40% feel like they're being picked on, I didn't feel like that was.

686
01:17:09,664 --> 01:17:13,485
I certainly don't think that's good.

687
01:17:14,045 --> 01:17:19,527
I'm just saying that from a raw data perspective, we have just chosen the agree and strongly agree

688
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:22,548
And those are what we called good forgiving scores.

689
01:17:22,608 --> 01:17:24,489
We have a list of scores that we got.

690
01:17:24,509 --> 01:17:24,489
69%, 31%, 43%.

691
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:36,634
Those scores are, there's no reason to have any scores if they're not going to actually be meaningful in relationship to each other, and they're not.

692
01:17:36,835 --> 01:17:38,775
This says 90% for school engagement.

693
01:17:39,136 --> 01:17:42,357
That could be good, that could be bad, depending on how the question was asked.

694
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:50,608
So we don't give grades out and be like, your A in this class might be a good thing, it might be a bad thing in this class.

695
01:17:51,068 --> 01:17:54,091
And your D in this class might be a good thing or it might be a bad thing.

696
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:58,454
Like there's a point to the scores meaning something.

697
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:04,618
And so maybe if we just got rid of all of these percentages, that might make sense.

698
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:11,684
But by including them, it just is a very weird thing to have a report that seems to be

699
01:18:12,759 --> 01:18:14,860
mixing and matching what's considered good.

700
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:22,162
If I may, I don't think that answers are what is being called to question.

701
01:18:22,662 --> 01:18:28,704
It's the interpretation of what the answers mean, and they are inconsistent across this report.

702
01:18:28,764 --> 01:18:35,627
So I would not want this report to be broadly published where somebody could take it and say, oh, 30%.

703
01:18:40,106 --> 01:18:50,859
think that only 30% of people don't think that kids are bullied and picked on when really 70% of people don't think that.

704
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:58,288
So some of it is about the design of the questions is problematic because some of them are positive and some of them are negative.

705
01:18:58,349 --> 01:18:58,589
And so

706
01:18:59,215 --> 01:19:16,035
whether you agree or you disagree, the right answer, like the yes, things are good answer is different from question to question to question, which is not great like survey hygiene, because it makes it really hard for people to take the survey.

707
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:08,613
you you

708
01:27:38,746 --> 01:27:38,886
You You

709
01:28:41,651 --> 01:28:42,171
Hi, everyone.

710
01:28:42,491 --> 01:28:43,051
We're back.

711
01:28:44,251 --> 01:28:46,612
We lost internet.

712
01:28:47,592 --> 01:28:48,492
Mayor, can you hear us?

713
01:28:52,273 --> 01:28:53,053
Yes, I can.

714
01:28:56,381 --> 01:28:57,282
very happy to hear that.

715
01:28:57,442 --> 01:28:57,722
Okay.

716
01:28:58,222 --> 01:28:59,122
Um sorry about that.

717
01:28:59,182 --> 01:29:09,684
Everybody who was watching the internet here in Council Chambers went down and disconnected us from Zoom although it looks like you all were able to mostly stick with us.

718
01:29:10,524 --> 01:29:20,606
Um before we recessed, we were having a discussion about the report on school climate that the superintendent was providing and I

719
01:29:23,976 --> 01:29:36,020
Internet, I did ask the superintendent if her preference would be to finish delivering this report or if she wanted to table it to sort of just do the double check of the data to make sure it is accurate.

720
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:48,964
And I think, you know, we don't need or want to do it twice, but I will defer to you in terms of whether you want to proceed or if you would like to table.

721
01:29:53,612 --> 01:29:53,957
Thank you.

722
01:29:56,843 --> 01:30:26,303
I think based on some of the questions that were starting to be surfaced, again, as I said, I interpreted this data as a benchmark, not a report card, but hearing some of the questions and concerns, I do not mind going back over the data again to review it one more time and see if the information can

723
01:30:28,003 --> 01:30:34,586
be looked at or presented with a slightly different interpretation.

724
01:30:34,606 --> 01:30:41,728
I don't mind going back to the drawing board to do it again and bring it back before the committee at our very next meeting.

725
01:30:42,569 --> 01:30:43,109
Member Graham?

726
01:30:43,929 --> 01:30:44,649
Member McLaughlin?

727
01:30:44,869 --> 01:30:50,591
I think I was also called on just before the blackout, the internet.

728
01:30:51,452 --> 01:30:52,052
I just wanted to

729
01:30:52,665 --> 01:31:02,673
to say that I appreciate the work on the survey and I know that a lot goes into these things and that oftentimes data, at least the interpretation of data can be subjective.

730
01:31:04,174 --> 01:31:14,783
And I do think that the strength in areas for growth by category based on the superintendent support report told me that there was an understanding there of a lot of the material.

731
01:31:15,343 --> 01:31:21,929
I certainly also don't think any of us are qualified PhDs other than Dr. Edward Vincent and

732
01:31:22,981 --> 01:31:28,844
Dr. Cushing, who I know had to go through a lot of data to get that degree.

733
01:31:29,704 --> 01:31:43,590
So the understanding of that is clearly much more on your end than on our end, but I guess it's the interpretation for us, much like we interpret other languages, interpreting this for the lay person, I think would be super helpful.

734
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:51,814
So one of the recommendations I might make is that, you know, with the question and the answers that maybe there's an affirmative percent and a negative percent.

735
01:31:52,355 --> 01:31:57,738
So the question is this, this percentage answer in the affirmative, this percentage answer in the negative.

736
01:31:58,178 --> 01:32:01,960
And then we can decide how we want to, instead of having just a favorable and then it'd be subjective.

737
01:32:03,001 --> 01:32:03,801
That's what I would recommend.

738
01:32:03,821 --> 01:32:12,145
I'm sure you have plenty of colleagues that would recommend other things, but that's just how I would see it so that every question has an affirmative and a negative percentage wise.

739
01:32:12,205 --> 01:32:13,686
And we could see sort of what that means.

740
01:32:14,166 --> 01:32:15,507
I think we do see it on the graph.

741
01:32:15,547 --> 01:32:16,768
I think a lot of other people don't.

742
01:32:17,788 --> 01:32:19,289
We can see it on the graph and I think that's helpful.

743
01:32:19,329 --> 01:32:20,850
And also your interpretation has been helpful.

744
01:32:21,343 --> 01:32:31,700
But again, I just want to say, I very much respect your and Dr. Cushion's doctoral degrees in research and statistics and understand all that you had to go through for that.

745
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,943
So I appreciate you interpreting.

746
01:32:34,744 --> 01:32:35,045
Thank you.

747
01:32:36,161 --> 01:32:53,747
And I just want to recognize the entire team both Suzanne, Joan, and Tom Thomas for helping with the presentation and the language to be able to try to keep the language, clear and understandable.

748
01:32:55,708 --> 01:32:58,849
But I will definitely take that feedback I hadn't

749
01:33:03,035 --> 01:33:26,085
The packet that I gave you says favorable, I don't have a problem presenting it as, going back and representing it differently so that the numbers are there, what it says, either remove the favorable completely, the percentages, or add both so that people could look at it

750
01:33:28,382 --> 01:33:30,784
I'm definitely willing to go back and do that.

751
01:33:31,524 --> 01:33:37,528
If it will provide greater clarity, and not lead, make people lean one way or the other.

752
01:33:39,249 --> 01:33:53,599
I will say that I did try to do the color coding to kind of simplify based on feedback that we've received other times of kind of what we felt was really strong in the middle, an area for

753
01:33:55,575 --> 01:34:08,162
You know, varied responses and then the areas that clearly were areas identified as serious world, but I'm willing to go back and shuffle.

754
01:34:08,582 --> 01:34:08,882
Thank you.

755
01:34:09,022 --> 01:34:14,625
The essence of it but take away those percentages if it's definitely confusing.

756
01:34:15,045 --> 01:34:16,366
Thank you member grandma respond.

757
01:34:18,263 --> 01:34:20,304
So I like the color graphs and the bar graphs.

758
01:34:20,344 --> 01:34:21,185
I think it's super helpful.

759
01:34:21,265 --> 01:34:22,906
I actually think the percentages are helpful.

760
01:34:22,966 --> 01:34:29,929
I just think, again, in the affirmative and the negative, but that's my perception, but obviously you'll have another opportunity at this.

761
01:34:30,089 --> 01:34:41,876
And the other thing is I want to ask how, and if it hasn't been, maybe we could think about how this has been presented to our students in our connections program and our access program.

762
01:34:42,389 --> 01:34:45,814
how they access the survey, and I'm not sure if they have.

763
01:34:45,934 --> 01:34:47,236
I don't need an answer to that question.

764
01:34:47,616 --> 01:34:51,301
I want to make sure that they do and that their input is included.

765
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:56,789
So I think that I can think of a number of ways that that can happen, and I'm sure Ms.

766
01:34:56,809 --> 01:34:59,172
Bowen can think of a number of ways that can happen if it hasn't already.

767
01:34:59,972 --> 01:35:19,962
I also would be remiss I want to thank Mr. Paul DeLava as well who's been working with us in a data capacity, helping us look at data, a little differently as well so I just want to recognize him as well for working with us so we will continue.

768
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:22,564
I will go back to the drawing board to.

769
01:35:23,865 --> 01:35:31,599
Try to take the feedback that you have just given and see if that will help to make.

770
01:35:36,835 --> 01:35:46,642
substantially change the ratings that I had, but at least the numbers that the essence of what we felt the survey was saying.

771
01:35:47,382 --> 01:35:50,344
Again, there were clear areas that we were very strong.

772
01:35:51,225 --> 01:35:54,747
And again, areas that we want to work on.

773
01:35:56,428 --> 01:35:59,471
And then areas that need immediate attention.

774
01:36:00,411 --> 01:36:09,034
And I'll also be working, continuing to work with the high school team because they also, Ms.

775
01:36:09,054 --> 01:36:10,814
Cabral and Ms.

776
01:36:10,834 --> 01:36:15,896
Schulman also helped to look at this data as well.

777
01:36:16,096 --> 01:36:21,838
And they're just helping us to look at it and see where are we going in terms of next steps.

778
01:36:22,498 --> 01:36:27,700
So I will take it back to the drawing board and represent it again.

779
01:36:28,234 --> 01:36:34,059
Okay, before we make an official motion to table I did see a hand on zoom, Jessica.

780
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:41,585
And Jessica just to be clear, we will talk about this in its totality at our next meeting.

781
01:36:42,486 --> 01:36:44,467
But if you had something you wanted to say tonight.

782
01:36:45,128 --> 01:36:46,229
I wanted to welcome you to do so.

783
