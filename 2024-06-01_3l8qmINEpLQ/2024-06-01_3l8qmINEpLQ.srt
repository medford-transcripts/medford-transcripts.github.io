1
00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:07,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, apologize for the technical issues, everybody, but I believe we are good right now to start.

2
00:00:07,972 --> 00:00:14,214
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee, Medford City Council.

3
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:15,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Clerk, can you please call the roll?

4
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:41,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan.

5
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:42,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

6
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Council member present.

7
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:02,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait.

8
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:03,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

9
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:09,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am going to be chairing this committee at the request of

10
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:17,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins, who's normally the chair of this committee, leave the first item.

11
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:31,525
[SPEAKER_02]: The first and only item on the agenda is paper 22-310, offered by President Bears and Vice President Collins, housing home rule petitions.

12
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:37,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will leave this to any

13
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:48,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just gonna go ahead and leave this to any individual Councilors that, oh, yes.

14
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:53,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Just gonna leave this to any individual Councilors that would like to speak.

15
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:56,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Chair, if I can.

16
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:57,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, yep.

17
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:07,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, just for, um, just for edification tonight, uh, Wednesdays have been a very difficult night for me because I also work on Wednesday, some Wednesday nights.

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to stay in this meeting as long as I can.

19
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:14,343
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately won't be able to attend the seven o'clock meeting.

20
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:20,745
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted that, um, that to be no night, not, I'm not disrespecting anyone.

21
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:25,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, uh, unfortunately every other Wednesday, it looks like I've been, uh,

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,504
[SPEAKER_09]: had to work my regular job.

23
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:32,227
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

24
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:34,009
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

25
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:34,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

26
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:40,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to pass this off to Vice President Collins as the sponsor of this paper.

27
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:42,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So feel free to feel free to take it away.

28
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

29
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:53,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank the Councilor for chairing this meeting because I have to be remote tonight.

30
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:54,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate that.

31
00:02:56,207 --> 00:03:01,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the first time that we are talking about this paper in committee, even though it was introduced in 2022.

32
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:02,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to begin

33
00:03:04,457 --> 00:03:16,400
[SPEAKER_03]: with a brief overview of the paper, what it is, what it isn't, why it was brought up, when it was, and just to kind of place us at the beginning of a discussion about this topic.

34
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I mentioned, this was brought forward by myself and President Bears in 2022.

35
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:30,383
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time, this was a resolution that bundled together many ideas for housing stability-related home rule petitions.

36
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:45,608
[SPEAKER_03]: It included, these ideas included rent stabilization, tenant right to purchase, tenant right to counsel, just cause eviction protections, anti-price gouging protections, exemptions for small owner-occupant landlords.

37
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:56,331
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a resolution that bundled together kind of a roster of different ideas that have been used by various local municipalities all around the goal of

38
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:01,413
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to introduce some stability into a housing market that is governed by market forces.

39
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:07,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also want to speak a little bit to the particular moment during which this paper arose.

40
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:11,758
[SPEAKER_03]: This was, I believe, March of 2022.

41
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:20,062
[SPEAKER_03]: We had just had an issue right here in Medford Square, where a large apartment building on Bradley Road, all of the tenants had been served notices to quit.

42
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:24,624
[SPEAKER_03]: The story given was renovations to the apartments.

43
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:41,908
[SPEAKER_03]: But in effect, what we saw play out at the site was that a recent change of hands for the property and the property owners wanted to be able to rent those units at very much higher rates than they had been rented to for years.

44
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw a lot of tenants leave the community.

45
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:52,670
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw a lot of tenants kind of have to react to this with not a lot of information, not a lot of options.

46
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,392
[SPEAKER_03]: and come to the City Council for help and say, what can we do?

47
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:02,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, we had to say, you know, there's not a lot that we can do.

48
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,716
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we cannot intervene in this kind of situation.

49
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:09,358
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't get between, we can't get in the middle of this transaction.

50
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:16,342
[SPEAKER_03]: We can provide you with folks who are experts in this type of situation, but there's nothing that the City Council can do.

51
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:21,905
[SPEAKER_03]: to help you stay in your home, stay in your community, keep your commute the same, keep your kid in public schools.

52
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:31,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So these ideas came out of that conversation with those tenants, I believe almost all of whom eventually ended up getting displaced out of the community.

53
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:38,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that time, of course, we've seen other unfortunate examples of

54
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:49,226
[SPEAKER_03]: rent increases so exorbitant that they had the same effect of displacing tenants out of the community when they otherwise would have remained community members.

55
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:56,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to give that framing for why that came up when it did because it's been a little while.

56
00:05:57,032 --> 00:06:01,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information if I can, Councilor.

57
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:03,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

58
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:06,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I appreciate this.

59
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:23,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to share just a couple of questions before we get going that people have reached out and I wanted to share that with this topic being very important, it is also a hot topic button that

60
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:41,407
[SPEAKER_09]: that we had some questions on whether the information that we received today from you was enough time for any legal ramification with the open meeting law, what the information is.

61
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:54,272
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other one that I needed to share with you, Councilor Collins, that I had residents calling me asking if we can table this portion for the fact that tonight is a holy night and we have a lot of people that

62
00:06:55,412 --> 00:07:01,777
[SPEAKER_09]: couldn't make this meeting at such a short notice once they understood what was involved.

63
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:17,270
[SPEAKER_09]: So although I feel some of these points are very important in what we saw with the issue that you talked about, I think as a whole this is something that really has to have more of an open dialogue with

64
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:22,944
[SPEAKER_09]: from beginning to end with all the stakeholders in the community.

65
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:26,744
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that I just wanted to share that with you.

66
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:40,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you can consider that because I think that with such a hot topic issue right now, making sure that we don't alienate or try to divide with this topic.

67
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

68
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:44,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair Leming, if I may.

69
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:47,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, Councilor Collins or Vice President Collins.

70
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:49,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

71
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for raising that.

72
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:53,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

73
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:58,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that rent stabilization is absolutely an issue that gets people's hackles up, you know, wherever they feel about it.

74
00:07:58,656 --> 00:07:59,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely appreciate that.

75
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:11,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to, you know, and I think that Councilor Scarpelli, we're coming at this meeting actually in a similar frame of mind, you know, as you and I know through going through this process on various resolutions and ordinances.

76
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,006
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the beginning of a process.

77
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:18,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's probably going to be a fairly lengthy and thorough process because this is such a delicate issue.

78
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:26,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me return to sort of the framing of the issue, because I hope that I can speak to some of the concerns that you brought up, and I think that they're important ones.

79
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:38,149
[SPEAKER_03]: For those folks who don't know, a home rule petition is when any city says to the state,

80
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:42,139
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, state, here's a thing that ordinarily cities can't do.

81
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,440
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like for you to make an exception.

82
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:55,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that one way we can think about this process is that we're beginning the process of collaboratively drafting a piece of legislation that we would like the permission to do.

83
00:08:56,626 --> 00:09:00,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I heard from some folks this afternoon who said, please do not pass this bill.

84
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,129
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not passing a bill tonight.

85
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:07,574
[SPEAKER_03]: This is conversation number one of many about a topic that's going to take a lot of time to talk about.

86
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:08,715
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just the beginning.

87
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:19,344
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there were meeting documents circulated before the meeting, which is common practice for us to circulate common drafts for Councilors to read before the meeting starts.

88
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:25,309
[SPEAKER_03]: My intent, and I'll make these motions later in the meeting, is for us to open up a conversation in this meeting.

89
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:35,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Afterwards, we'll circulate the documents to relevant city staff, stakeholders, and then we'll use them as a jumping off point for our next conversation on this.

90
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:39,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to follow up on the point I was making about the Home Rule petition,

91
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:51,808
[SPEAKER_03]: In the hypothetical scenario that we finish a home brawl petition about rent stabilization and just cause eviction, which is kind of the jumping off point that I created for a conversation tonight.

92
00:09:52,569 --> 00:10:01,396
[SPEAKER_03]: If that were to go through, if this council were to approve it, then it would go to our state delegation and the jurisdiction would be with them to approve or not.

93
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:03,017
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is just the standard procedure for

94
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:05,239
[SPEAKER_03]: for any Home Rule petition.

95
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:15,427
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to make that clear, because I know these things are often opaque outside of City Hall in terms of the process that we're looking at here.

96
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:27,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Pause there in case there are any questions from fellow Councilors on the process, or if not, I can just quickly run through more of the table setting.

97
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:31,379
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, to the Chair,

98
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:35,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

99
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

100
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:55,858
[SPEAKER_09]: So I appreciate that Councilor, but I also wanted to make sure it was addressed that we did have, being that even if it is a kicking off point, we do have residents that, you know, looked at what we had, but then the information that was sent out that

101
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:10,325
[SPEAKER_09]: that was shared that it was it's pretty intense and it's pretty like we know it's it's a volatile hot topic button so I think that you know the the understanding that a lot of

102
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:15,292
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a lot of homeowners that are at 6 o'clock mass tonight for a holy night.

103
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:17,954
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to make sure that we address that.

104
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:26,881
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something that, again, when we talk about this new process, because this is a new process, and how we're doing our subcommittees and different committees, this is new.

105
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:30,664
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think even with me, I was a little confused with the process.

106
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:35,848
[SPEAKER_09]: And getting the information now that will be outlining something that I think

107
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,830
[SPEAKER_09]: that people need to know from the jump.

108
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,930
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my input.

109
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:46,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I respect what you're trying to do.

110
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:50,274
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that, but I just wanted to make sure that I was heard.

111
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:50,774
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

112
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:55,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

113
00:11:55,717 --> 00:12:03,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there comments from any other councilors before Vice President Collins continues with her presentation?

114
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, go ahead, Vice President Collins.

115
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:10,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chair Leming, and thank you, Councilor Sparkely.

116
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:17,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate, and of course, I think it's obviously a goal that we share that everybody who'd like to weigh in has the opportunity to.

117
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:28,392
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my, as one councilor, it's not my intent that we're going to take any substantive action or vote to take actions on this draft tonight, but rather that this can be a draft that

118
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:42,081
[SPEAKER_03]: constituents, councilors, stakeholders, and city staff can continue to review starting tonight and in the run-up to our next meeting on the topic, giving everybody ample time to review it, and then we'll revisit the same draft.

119
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:47,064
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope that that'll provide a lot of opportunity for people to read it and digest it before we revisit it again.

120
00:12:50,717 --> 00:12:55,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Having said that, and of course, happy to circle back to the process at any point.

121
00:12:55,842 --> 00:13:13,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I think that I'm sure that there are other people in the room and on the Zoom tonight who can speak to the potential uses of rent stabilization and how it's been used in Massachusetts before later in the meeting, but just to quickly kind of frame the conversation.

122
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I mentioned, rent stabilization, I think most people know what it is.

123
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:32,772
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a way for a government entity, usually a city, to set a cap by which rent costs may not increase above that amount in a given year.

124
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:35,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it sets forth the exceptions to that.

125
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:44,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me find the... Trying to find a handy quote that I found in my research about this.

126
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:52,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is from, and pulling together some resources as I was preparing just myself for this meeting.

127
00:13:54,188 --> 00:14:00,771
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the strategies that the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission touches on on its website.

128
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:06,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they have a pretty handy encapsulation of what rent control does and doesn't do.

129
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:11,576
[SPEAKER_03]: They say rent control denies unlimited excessive rent increases, thus limiting profits.

130
00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:21,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Rent control does, however, allow for annual increases that provide owners a fair return on investment with sufficient income to maintain property in a satisfactory manner.

131
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:28,959
[SPEAKER_03]: They go on to say rent control laws usually include provisions that protect a landlord's investment in these ways.

132
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,740
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, sometimes defining fair return, a hardship appeals process.

133
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:36,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are

134
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:51,665
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many levers and exemptions and ways to tailor these policies that I think we can look to other cities, including cities in Massachusetts, to guide our discussion as we start looking at drafts, as we get beyond the

135
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:57,446
[SPEAKER_03]: preliminary table setting stage and into crafting a home rule petition.

136
00:14:58,586 --> 00:15:03,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's a lot of ways that cities have worked really hard to tailor this to their communities.

137
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:10,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that if this project goes forward, we'll be looking to do here in Medford is to say, what does this community need?

138
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And how can we tailor this to Medford?

139
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:25,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, the idea for this in Medford came out of a particularly visible displacement event.

140
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:34,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And that displacement in general in Medford continues to, we continue to see that happening in the community.

141
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:43,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I know for myself, I'm sure for some of my other Councilors, this is something that we hear about, unfortunately, from time to time, housing scarcity.

142
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:44,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, point of information.

143
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Chair?

144
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:51,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

145
00:15:52,511 --> 00:16:01,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I hate to interrupt, please forgive me, but as we're going down this road, I think we need to be very careful that we're not

146
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:19,492
[SPEAKER_09]: without any legal representation, as we're looking to go further with this, we're not looking at what we say and then coming back to bite us because there are financial ramifications that do affect the community and individuals in this community.

147
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:27,179
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, you know, I, you know, I know that I've asked, I just don't, I don't want to,

148
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:38,340
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, go down this hole and then find us in that BJ situation that we, we made a big faux pas and we're, uh, then backpedaling.

149
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would, I would caution to move forward with this.

150
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:49,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I, you know, I, I, I would second 22 it, but, um, I right now that, that, that, that's coming close.

151
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:54,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't, this is too much in play with this, this, um,

152
00:16:55,434 --> 00:17:07,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that if we're talking about pieces of this that talked about this issue that's brought apart apart, but as we're looking at rent control, that's a whole different, different animal.

153
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:11,139
[SPEAKER_09]: This is this is something that's going to change this community drastically.

154
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:22,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And that will affect every homeowner and also what it would look like financially tax purposes as we move forward in in revenue.

155
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:22,422
[SPEAKER_09]: So I

156
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need to really understand as we're going forward.

157
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:40,539
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like I said, if I received this information, Madam Vice President, early, you know, with some time, I could have vetted this, but I honestly got this, the whole breakdown of what your resolution reads.

158
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,300
[SPEAKER_09]: about an hour and a half ago.

159
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:54,627
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask that we would table this to another date and move on to something else, because I think that this is something that might come back to us.

160
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,528
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

161
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan, then back to Councilor Collins.

162
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:06,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like, sorry.

163
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:10,487
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, oh, sorry, yep.

164
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:14,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli, was that a motion to table?

165
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:19,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

166
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:20,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

167
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a second?

168
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:33,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing no, seeing no second for that, for the motion to table.

169
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:39,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to move on to Councilor Callaghan and then Councilor Collins.

170
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:42,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

171
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a few questions.

172
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,220
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I don't, I don't see.

173
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:53,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are seven different Home Rule petitions listed, potential Home Rule petitions listed.

174
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:58,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any actual legal language for any of these seven?

175
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:06,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins, or Vice President Collins.

176
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:10,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan, for the question.

177
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:30,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I circulated around noon today through the city clerk some example language from the city of Somerville, a draft jumping off point document for our discussion for a potential home rule petition here in Medford, and a link to some background info from the MAPC.

178
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:37,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're correct, the original resolution included those ideas for seven home rule petitions.

179
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:41,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that, you know, seven is a lot to do in one meeting.

180
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:44,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it's the will of the council to advance with all of them.

181
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:51,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that this meeting, we could begin a conversation about rent stabilization in other communities.

182
00:19:51,177 --> 00:19:54,139
[SPEAKER_03]: They've bundled rent stabilization and just cause eviction together.

183
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:58,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what the document circulated by the clerk does.

184
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:05,438
[SPEAKER_07]: My second question, if I may, if I may just ask my second question.

185
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to double check.

186
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:10,419
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are, right now we're not discussing the other six.

187
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:18,040
[SPEAKER_07]: We're discussing the rent stabilization, which is referenced in a separate email.

188
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:22,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

189
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:25,062
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only discussing the rent stabilization today?

190
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:26,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

191
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:26,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

192
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:32,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information to the clerk, please, Mr. Chairperson.

193
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:39,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

194
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:50,255
[SPEAKER_09]: If it wasn't in, what is the ruling on open meeting law regulations with material that wasn't in place just a few hours ago?

195
00:20:50,275 --> 00:20:53,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Clerk.

196
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:04,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that supporting materials that are in the packets are allowed.

197
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:19,807
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as the item is on the agenda, there are often discussion items that go into the packets or are circulated ahead of the meetings, whether they're in the packet or not.

198
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:30,094
[SPEAKER_10]: But the open meeting law requires that the agenda spell it out in enough specificity that a reasonable person could know what was going on at the meeting.

199
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:40,050
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the question, because I'm getting phone calls and emails from that talk about home repetitions on stabilization.

200
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:48,113
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I got today was pretty in-depth and pretty lengthy and pretty intense.

201
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,273
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's where the slippery slope comes in.

202
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:53,014
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you for the clarification.

203
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:59,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go back to Vice President Collins.

204
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:06,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, we're going to let some of our speakers talk and then open it up for public comments.

205
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:11,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So Vice President Collins and then the speakers.

206
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chair Leming.

207
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

208
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:21,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I think it would be great to start hearing from some of the other city staff and advocates that I know are in the room.

209
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:40,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Just quickly, I want to say, you know, I think in my experience, it's, you know, I, sorry, two thoughts happening in my head at the same time.

210
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:54,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to really emphasize that for the purposes of this conversation, we are beginning a discussion about something that has been brought up by the City Council two years ago.

211
00:22:54,827 --> 00:23:01,331
[SPEAKER_03]: The intent to pursue this at some point has been public record for some time.

212
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,634
[SPEAKER_03]: The content of this resolution has been public record.

213
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:10,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear that people would like more time to look at the documents that have been circulated in support.

214
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:16,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It is true that we very often get supporting documents for meetings pretty close to the meeting time.

215
00:23:16,388 --> 00:23:19,171
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's been my experience for the past term.

216
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:24,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And I completely respect that people want more time to look through a draft.

217
00:23:25,897 --> 00:23:36,386
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was hoping that the purpose of this meeting could be to begin the conversation and then give people the intervening two or four weeks to read it and develop feedback and bring that to our next committee meeting on this topic.

218
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:38,408
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that we're all aligned on that.

219
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:47,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we turn it over to other speakers and people who have comments that they'd like to contribute to this discussion, I just want to again really emphasize that

220
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:56,913
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true that rent stabilization is talked about as if it's one thing, and it has one set of consequences, and those are always the same, and they're always bad.

221
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:07,400
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's really not true, and I think that we have the capacity and the creativity in this community to say, we have this issue.

222
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:09,582
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that there are people

223
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:13,845
[SPEAKER_03]: who want to move out of their parents' homes and get their own apartment in Medford.

224
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,547
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that there are people who want to have their own place.

225
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:18,849
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that there are couples that want to move in together.

226
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:24,033
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that there are people who can't afford to buy a home, but love it here and want to stay.

227
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:26,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that rent costs are a huge problem.

228
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,516
[SPEAKER_03]: for all of those types of people.

229
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:51,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that knowing this council, this is a proactive council, every member, I think that it is well worth our time to say, before we dismiss this, let's take a good long look at rent stabilization, something that other communities have looked at, and see if there's a way to tailor this to Medford so that we could keep more Medford residents in Medford.

230
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also want to note, again,

231
00:24:53,772 --> 00:25:01,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And people will see this when they take more time with the examples from other communities and with the draft home repetition for Medford that are created as a jumping off point.

232
00:25:01,737 --> 00:25:17,005
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are myriad exemptions that we can build in to make sure that this is not anything that is going to be dramatic or drastic for people who do own rental units in Medford, exemptions for smaller types of properties, exemptions for certain types of owners.

233
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:18,346
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all on the table.

234
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:26,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope that we can proceed with cool heads because I think that everybody's going to have something productive to continue to contribute to this conversation.

235
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave it there.

236
00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:34,960
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now going to open it up to members of the public.

237
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd first like to recognize some of our invited speakers.

238
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:47,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Katie McCann, and Eduardo Palacios from City Light, Fever, and Bona.

239
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,641
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to say anything, go ahead.

240
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:54,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, my name is, thank you.

241
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:55,863
[SPEAKER_06]: And hello, everybody.

242
00:25:55,963 --> 00:25:57,084
[SPEAKER_06]: How's everybody doing tonight?

243
00:25:57,104 --> 00:25:59,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope everybody's staying holy and warm in this cold day.

244
00:26:00,286 --> 00:26:01,627
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Eduardo Palacios.

245
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a community organizer of City Light, Fever, and Bona.

246
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:06,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been organizing in the Mallard Metro neighborhood area.

247
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:14,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that this is a great step in the right direction to help protect citizens, the residents of the city of Method.

248
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:30,970
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have already seen what it is to have someone from outside of the Medford city come into the Medford, buy up the property, and start mass evictions through the tenants of Medford that have been living there, many of them for over a decade.

249
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:32,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is why we are

250
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:40,622
[SPEAKER_06]: pushing for this whole petition to help protect the rest of the presidents of the city of Method for what's coming next.

251
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:47,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like that was only a small step that real estate and maximized profit is taking.

252
00:26:48,392 --> 00:26:49,894
[SPEAKER_06]: And unless we act quickly,

253
00:26:50,675 --> 00:27:03,164
[SPEAKER_06]: and preemptively try to defend this is going to be an issue that we're seeing in Chelsea, that we're seeing in East Boston, that we're seeing in parts of Everett, you know, that we're seeing all over the state where

254
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:11,184
[SPEAKER_06]: The rents are being raised dramatically, $500, $600, $700 is a common thing now.

255
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:17,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Properties are being bought up and tenants are being forced out for no fault of their own, no fault of their own.

256
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:26,797
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not because they owe rent, it's not because they destroyed a property, it's simply because an investor is trying to maximize their profits from these buildings.

257
00:27:28,218 --> 00:27:33,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford has always been the safe zone that we've always been able to go to.

258
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the Meadow Glen Mall.

259
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:36,481
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen it change.

260
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:44,844
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen gentrification start slowly happening, but in a way that we can still protect the residents, the citizens of the city of Method.

261
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:45,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's

262
00:27:46,204 --> 00:27:48,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, these are your constituents, right?

263
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:49,425
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why we come to you.

264
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:59,229
[SPEAKER_06]: We're asking for this help and helping us prevent this fallout war that's going to come eventually if we do not take the step forward to help protect it.

265
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:10,433
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're asking not just as neighbors, not just as tenants from sister neighborhoods and sister cities, but as organizers, as workers, as people that have to work nine to five to

266
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:13,895
[SPEAKER_06]: be able to pay the bills and pay the rent.

267
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:21,517
[SPEAKER_06]: We're asking you to help us protect the city of Method and its constituents from a maximized profit gain that doesn't benefit us.

268
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:28,279
[SPEAKER_06]: While they extract, you know, what we see from other places, they extract everything that came from our community and push everyone else out.

269
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:31,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're asking you to please take this into consideration.

270
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,481
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great step in the right direction and it will help

271
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:37,982
[SPEAKER_06]: protect the residents of Mexico.

272
00:28:38,443 --> 00:28:44,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that example, we lead by it and help establish that in the city of Maui, and so on and so forth.

273
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:47,709
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're asking that we be leaders in this world of followers.

274
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:49,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

275
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:54,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Eduardo, could you also state your name and address for record?

276
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:57,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologies that I forgot to ask you that explicitly.

277
00:28:57,515 --> 00:28:59,176
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

278
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:01,037
[SPEAKER_06]: You said my name and address?

279
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:05,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just just say your name and address.

280
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:07,510
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Eduardo Palacios.

281
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:12,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I live in 766 Broadway in Everett, Massachusetts.

282
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:12,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 2149.

283
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:14,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

284
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:15,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

285
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:15,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.

286
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Katie, name and address for the record.

287
00:29:21,983 --> 00:29:22,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

288
00:29:22,464 --> 00:29:24,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Katie McCann.

289
00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:27,068
[SPEAKER_05]: 91 Rossmoor Road, number two, Jamaica plan.

290
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:32,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

291
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:50,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Katie McCann and I'm a community organizer at City Light Theatre Urbana, a grassroots passive justice organization in Boston, which organizes with renters and homeowners against displacement in the greater Boston area, including Medford for several years.

292
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:52,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I, along with my colleague Eduardo,

293
00:29:52,731 --> 00:30:08,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I've worked with Metro residents facing large rent increases and no-fall evictions from large corporate landlords to organize for their agreements so that they could stay in their homes, including at the building that Vice President Collins mentioned on Bradley Road.

294
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:13,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to express my strong support for this rent stabilization on-roll petition.

295
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:21,802
[SPEAKER_05]: This rent stabilization on-roll petition is one of the most important tools this community needs to address the affordable housing and displacement crisis.

296
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:36,503
[SPEAKER_05]: In Medford and communities across the state, we're seeing families be displaced from their homes, and even out of Massachusetts altogether, by mass no fault evictions, investor building sales, and enormous rent increases by corporate landlords.

297
00:30:37,024 --> 00:30:42,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the residents of the Bradley Road building were displaced very far away from Medford.

298
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:54,497
[SPEAKER_05]: The displacement of children from their schools causes serious lasting impacts on their education and causes serious lasting impacts on physical and mental health for all residents.

299
00:30:55,718 --> 00:31:02,743
[SPEAKER_05]: This statewide crisis is urgent and this crisis in Medford is particularly urgent and cities and towns including Medford need every

300
00:31:03,516 --> 00:31:06,700
[SPEAKER_05]: tool that stabilizes community members in their homes.

301
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:13,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Rent control is a solution that immediately addresses the housing crisis and would protect the broadest number of working class families

302
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,787
[SPEAKER_05]: seniors, people of color, and immigrants.

303
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:28,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a strong model for how cities and towns can protect residents from displacement, very similar to Summerville's Home Rule petition, which recently passed unanimously.

304
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:37,031
[SPEAKER_05]: We must do everything that we can to keep community members in their homes by giving Medford the ability to protect working class renters from displacement now.

305
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Collins, for your leadership on this.

306
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:47,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to open it up to members of the public.

307
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:50,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have anyone that would like to comment on this?

308
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record.

309
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:59,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelly Catalo, and I live at 9A Mountain Road in Burlington.

310
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:04,269
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a former Medford resident that was displaced as a property owner.

311
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:10,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't afford to buy a house in Medford, and that's how my family ended up in Burlington two years ago.

312
00:32:11,235 --> 00:32:15,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to do anything to stop the price of the increased cost of housing?

313
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:16,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

314
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:27,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should be pointed out to the public that both of your speakers that you just had are actually an organization that comes in and they organize tenants

315
00:32:27,524 --> 00:32:29,785
[SPEAKER_01]: to get them to fight against landlords.

316
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:41,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we go back to the building on Bradley Road, everybody should know the person who bought that building paid millions and millions of dollars for a building that needed a ton of work.

317
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:46,651
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that were living in the building, I happened to replace quite a few of them.

318
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:51,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Their rent was well below what anybody else was paying.

319
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a big attrition there.

320
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:59,718
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no way that those people were going to be made whole, whether they stayed there or they went somewhere else.

321
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:01,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Their rent was brought up.

322
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:05,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is a victim of its own success.

323
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:06,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a bad thing.

324
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:08,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone said, bring in the green line.

325
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:09,904
[SPEAKER_01]: We want the amenity of the green line.

326
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:13,306
[SPEAKER_01]: We call that the money line, because where does it go?

327
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:14,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes to Kendall Square.

328
00:33:14,986 --> 00:33:16,827
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes down to the medical buildings.

329
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:22,350
[SPEAKER_01]: People that work in those high paying jobs, that's where they travel to, is on that train.

330
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:28,794
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming to Medford, and I'll tell you, I represent 732 landlords in the city of Method.

331
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need me to come back with a petition, I will.

332
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:33,436
[SPEAKER_01]: They would like to be heard on this.

333
00:33:33,516 --> 00:33:36,198
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want just the tenant end of it being heard.

334
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:41,705
[SPEAKER_01]: There really is not a problem with a lot of the landlords and a lot of the tenants in Medford.

335
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:47,452
[SPEAKER_01]: They communicate very well because the majority of the landlords in Medford are small property owners.

336
00:33:47,873 --> 00:33:49,755
[SPEAKER_01]: They own one or two units.

337
00:33:50,757 --> 00:33:58,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an email here, which I am going to read into the record, and it's from one of my clients who emailed everyone on this council today.

338
00:33:58,922 --> 00:34:07,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear housing members, as a homeowner of a three-family house in Medford for almost 60 years, I have never written to the mayor or city council before.

339
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:12,991
[SPEAKER_01]: But when a friend told me today that there was a meeting at city hall tonight at 6 p.m.

340
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:19,455
[SPEAKER_01]: where the Medford City Council's Housing Self Committee will propose creating zoning that will control rent

341
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:27,221
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, and landlord rights to evict a tenant for any reason, I was appalled and had to write to all those concerned in this matter.

342
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:35,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Firstly, regarding rent control around 1970 Boston, Cambridge, Sumbul instituted rent control, Medford did not.

343
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:41,091
[SPEAKER_01]: It ended in the late 70s there about with Boston abolishing it around 1994.

344
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:47,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Voters voted it out for the simple reason that the homes in those cities were deteriorating at a rapid pace.

345
00:34:47,716 --> 00:34:52,500
[SPEAKER_01]: The landlords, mostly small, did not garner enough revenue to fix important breakdowns.

346
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,941
[SPEAKER_01]: So the apartments eventually were like trash.

347
00:34:55,362 --> 00:35:00,285
[SPEAKER_01]: The carpenters, electricians, plumbers wages were going up during that time, but not the rents.

348
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:04,869
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was difficult to fix deteriorating structures without the proper income.

349
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't let that happen in Medford.

350
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:13,875
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as ending landlord's rights to evict a tenant for any reason, whoa, that's not a good idea.

351
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:23,882
[SPEAKER_01]: In our almost 60 years of marriage and many tenants, last year found us with a tenant who always missed paying his monthly rent with unbelievable excuses.

352
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:30,707
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to call him three to four times the week before the first of each month to remind him that the rent was almost due.

353
00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:34,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Even then the rent was not received until two to three weeks later.

354
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:43,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we told him that another tenant had an allergy to cats for so pets were not allowed within three months he's serendipitously brought in a cat.

355
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:47,079
[SPEAKER_01]: My other tenant was about to give us notice for that reason.

356
00:35:47,419 --> 00:35:53,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told the cat tenant that since we're not on the same page, and he has about two to three months to find another apartment.

357
00:35:54,224 --> 00:35:57,187
[SPEAKER_01]: He left quietly on the first of the month.

358
00:35:57,427 --> 00:36:00,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if I did not have the right to evict him for any reason.

359
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:04,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, that was the first time in all those years that I've had to evict someone.

360
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:10,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I have more to say, but I want to get this email over to you all before the 6 p.m.

361
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:10,860
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting tonight.

362
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we all knew sooner about this meeting.

363
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:31,610
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to ask you, maybe you could publish the entire community, a lot of communities, they send their notices out with their water bills, you're mailing it anyways, you're mailing a tax bill, send a notice to the whole city that you would like to discuss the landlord and the tenant issue here.

364
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:38,713
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is if you cannot come up with a solution that is going to help the rising interest rates, what?

365
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,475
[SPEAKER_02]: just notifying you you have 30 seconds.

366
00:36:41,855 --> 00:36:42,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

367
00:36:42,595 --> 00:36:42,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

368
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:46,098
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a little clock.

369
00:36:46,418 --> 00:37:01,148
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not going to be able to stop the rising cost of the repairs, stop the rising cost of real estate, stop the rising interest rates, we're not gonna be able to fix the problems because right now you're trying to handicap people and just trying to help the community.

370
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:02,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

371
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:09,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Chair, President Farris, thank you.

372
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:20,724
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I think as we discuss these issues of housing and housing affordability and accessibility in our community,

373
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:26,945
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important that we have all the tools on the table as possible.

374
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:32,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there are groups of folks who say supply is the only way out.

375
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,593
[SPEAKER_08]: There's groups of folks who don't want anything new to be built.

376
00:37:36,193 --> 00:37:41,658
[SPEAKER_08]: There's groups of folks who want as few regulations on the landlord-tenant relationship as possible.

377
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,120
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly there are people who want

378
00:37:45,202 --> 00:37:49,409
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, extreme regulations on the landlord-tenant relationship.

379
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:54,558
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the answer is actually somewhere in all of those.

380
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,162
[SPEAKER_08]: we're going to continue to work with the city to improve policies.

381
00:37:58,182 --> 00:37:58,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Um.

382
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have on our agenda.

383
00:38:00,003 --> 00:38:06,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we have passed, uh, already is only recalibration in 2022 that has brought some significant new projects to the city.

384
00:38:07,188 --> 00:38:14,492
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to be over this term, passing a complete zoning reform update based on the housing production and comprehensive plan that I think will, um,

385
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:22,938
[SPEAKER_08]: That's part of the conversation we're having.

386
00:38:23,238 --> 00:38:33,485
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also having a conversation tonight here about having the state give us more tools in our toolbox when it comes to anti displacement regulations.

387
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:37,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say a few things, just put them out there.

388
00:38:37,368 --> 00:38:40,690
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they have already been said, I apologize, I had to step out for a minute.

389
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:57,241
[SPEAKER_08]: rent control rent stabilization laws were allowed in this state until 1994 when a ballot question passed by less than 1% of the vote is about 50.5 to 49.5 to overrule them.

390
00:38:57,842 --> 00:39:00,425
[SPEAKER_08]: At that time, there were only three communities that had rent control.

391
00:39:01,246 --> 00:39:06,408
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe actually even just two, Boston and Cambridge, I think Somerville had repealed at the time already.

392
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:15,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Somerville had them in 94 too, but either way, the point being that the voters in those cities that had rent control overwhelmingly voted in favor of keeping it.

393
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:21,434
[SPEAKER_08]: It was voters in Wellesley and Weston and Newton who voted against it.

394
00:39:22,435 --> 00:39:24,176
[SPEAKER_08]: And those are the reasons that rent control ended.

395
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:27,257
[SPEAKER_08]: So someone from outside of the cities that wanted this

396
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:45,273
[SPEAKER_08]: have put a ballot question, you know, property owners put a ballot, landlords put a ballot question on the agenda to restrict communities from making decisions at the local level and giving communities the local authority to pass policies that they felt would best address issues of displacement in their community.

397
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:52,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Overruling the voices of the people in the communities that had rent control at the time who overwhelmingly again voted to keep it.

398
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:55,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Now,

399
00:39:56,618 --> 00:40:01,160
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a few other things that have come up tonight around what this is going to mean, what this is going to do.

400
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:19,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I think at the end of the day, when you look at the policy, and I just read through the details of what Vice President Collins submitted earlier today, what this policy does, A, it exempts properties with two or fewer dwelling units on which one of the dwelling units is the owner's principal residence.

401
00:40:19,106 --> 00:40:23,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're a two-family owner and you live in one unit and you're renting the other, this wouldn't apply to you.

402
00:40:25,105 --> 00:40:31,214
[SPEAKER_08]: It exempts to several other examples as well, dormitories, hotels, public housing, etc.

403
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:34,820
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really targeted at the price gouging.

404
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:46,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It's targeted at the hundreds and thousands dollar increases from year to year at the multiple, at the two digit percent increases per year.

405
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:55,829
[SPEAKER_08]: It says that there should be no increase greater than 5% in this language, but it also says that there'll be an exemption for fair return standards.

406
00:40:55,949 --> 00:41:00,113
[SPEAKER_08]: So that if you have, if you can go up above 5%, if you can show

407
00:41:01,414 --> 00:41:06,579
[SPEAKER_08]: that your maintenance and capital costs are going up, that your utility costs are going up, that your property taxes are going up.

408
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:11,463
[SPEAKER_08]: So it actually addresses all of these concerns that have come out and says if, you know,

409
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:16,628
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 5% seems reasonable and most years that's significantly above inflation.

410
00:41:18,448 --> 00:41:24,130
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have costs that are going up above that, the city can put that in the regulations that that can be addressed as part of it as well.

411
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:30,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So to be honest, this is pretty balanced policy when it comes to the eviction protections here.

412
00:41:31,373 --> 00:41:35,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Every reason that was cited by the resident in their email

413
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:45,418
[SPEAKER_08]: for reasons that they would be afraid, that they would want to evict someone, having a cat against the lease, not paying their rent, otherwise violating their lease policies.

414
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:48,360
[SPEAKER_08]: All of that is just cause under this policy.

415
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:57,983
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going and saying, when a corporation buys a building and tells everyone it's time to get out, we're renovating and we're jacking up the rights by double.

416
00:41:58,663 --> 00:41:59,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a just cause?

417
00:42:00,762 --> 00:42:12,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think anyone would dispute that non-payment of rent or violating the lease or causing health effects by having pets in the home against the terms of the lease.

418
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, those are things that shouldn't be happening.

419
00:42:14,794 --> 00:42:19,298
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they're specifically listed as just causes in this document.

420
00:42:20,296 --> 00:42:43,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's about putting on paper and saying, and as we are seeing with the MAPC released recently, that over 20% of our housing stock is being bought up by large corporations, Wall Street investors, BlackRock, Vanguard, et cetera, to further financialize and corporatize shelter and housing, that there needs to be balance.

421
00:42:45,168 --> 00:43:01,731
[SPEAKER_08]: And that while we are going to look at supply and increasing supply and allowing what this community has not allowed for a long time, private property owners to do, which is build the things that they want to build on their land, that there also has to be an anti-displacement part of that contract as well.

422
00:43:01,951 --> 00:43:09,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And that there are reasonable regulations that can be adopted such as the ones here to ensure that

423
00:43:09,873 --> 00:43:28,060
[SPEAKER_08]: while we try to get to a better place, while we try to get more affordable housing, more naturally affordable housing, to lower the cost of housing, which I know people don't necessarily, you know, it's funny, everyone says housing costs too much, but nobody wants their housing price to go down, right?

424
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a bit of a cash 22 there.

425
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:34,022
[SPEAKER_08]: But as we move more towards balance,

426
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:39,609
[SPEAKER_08]: there needs to be something in place in the interim to prevent the displacement of people.

427
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:48,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoever's left at this point, as Kelly Catala noted and many others have noted, many people have already been displaced.

428
00:43:48,594 --> 00:43:53,437
[SPEAKER_08]: If we just say, okay, we're gonna do the zoning and we're gonna wait for supply to come up, thousands more people will be displaced.

429
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:56,219
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why policies like these are important.

430
00:43:56,279 --> 00:43:58,780
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate the draft that is before us.

431
00:43:58,861 --> 00:43:59,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

432
00:44:00,301 --> 00:44:09,107
[SPEAKER_02]: and I did see that Councilor Callahan had her hand raised twice, but I would like to finish up the public comments period before moving on.

433
00:44:09,127 --> 00:44:12,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other members of the public that would like to speak?

434
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record.

435
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:18,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Alicia Hunt.

436
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:22,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the director of planning, development and sustainability for the city of Method.

437
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:26,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to just say a few brief words.

438
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:34,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I did want to introduce to you all that I have with me this evening, Aditi Mugar, who is our new housing planner.

439
00:44:35,428 --> 00:44:50,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Aditi and I have not actually had a chance to review this document as well before this evening, but we would love to offer that Aditi would be happy to review it, to do some research, to provide some feedback, to look at stuff from other communities as well.

440
00:44:51,671 --> 00:44:56,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're happy to provide feedback, just not tonight, because not on the short notice.

441
00:44:56,973 --> 00:45:06,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I did want to mention a couple of things that we have been noticing, and I would love for, be curious as to whether this would address it or something else.

442
00:45:07,217 --> 00:45:13,720
[SPEAKER_04]: So you all know, as we've all talked about, Medford has traditionally been a starter home community where people could afford to buy first homes.

443
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I myself bought my first home here in Medford for exactly that reason.

444
00:45:19,382 --> 00:45:31,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're finding that with corporations buying up houses and with developers buying houses and doing major renovations on them, it's not leaving very much for starter homes.

445
00:45:31,606 --> 00:45:34,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is an issue that we're interested in researching.

446
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:37,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that rent stabilization will deal with that.

447
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that is one.

448
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:49,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other is that we'd love to better understand the numbers in Medford for corporations buying homes, um, and then holding them and renting them out and taking them off the open market.

449
00:45:49,971 --> 00:45:52,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's something that's on our list for me to look into.

450
00:45:53,792 --> 00:46:03,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and just as a side thought, I just wanted to share that in the past, um, when we have had ordinances and things that we'd like to pass,

451
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:17,704
[SPEAKER_04]: legal counsel has advised my office specifically that they would really like for the staff and the council to come to an agreement on what language they would like to be including before they start doing their legal reviews.

452
00:46:18,305 --> 00:46:23,906
[SPEAKER_04]: If one wants to ask them, is a home rule petition allowed, they could give advice on that.

453
00:46:24,286 --> 00:46:32,151
[SPEAKER_04]: but they don't want to spend time reviewing language until there's been some agreement on what the council would like to pass.

454
00:46:32,532 --> 00:46:36,074
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to share that that's been my experience for other ordinances.

455
00:46:36,775 --> 00:46:37,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

456
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:38,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good evening.

457
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:39,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

458
00:46:39,617 --> 00:46:41,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other members of the public?

459
00:46:44,206 --> 00:46:50,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, seeing none, the chambers are on zoom going to close the public comments period.

460
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:53,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Councilor Callahan was there.

461
00:46:53,055 --> 00:46:56,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that you'd like to like, just like to speak to.

462
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,482
[SPEAKER_07]: No, really, President Bayer said what I was going to say.

463
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:15,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the person who wrote in that was read in public comment misunderstood what is in this draft with the idea that currently you can evict people for any reason.

464
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:19,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we change that, that doesn't mean that you can't evict them for any reason.

465
00:47:19,455 --> 00:47:22,277
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many reasons that you certainly can evict people.

466
00:47:22,557 --> 00:47:23,958
[SPEAKER_07]: You can evict them if they don't pay their rent.

467
00:47:24,218 --> 00:47:26,380
[SPEAKER_07]: You can evict them if they have a cat and that's against the lease.

468
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,802
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, any of these things are perfectly valid reasons to evict someone.

469
00:47:29,822 --> 00:47:35,706
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there was a misunderstanding and I hope that that came through in President Baer's message.

470
00:47:35,806 --> 00:47:36,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

471
00:47:38,028 --> 00:47:39,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

472
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:49,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chair Levening, and thank you to all of the constituents, advocates, city staff that has spoken.

473
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:54,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Really appreciate getting some preliminary voices into the discussion.

474
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:58,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that this is

475
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:16,844
[SPEAKER_03]: What our conversation just in the past 15 minutes has, I think, reinforced for me is that this is a topic and a term that is so heavily connotated that using these meetings to bring that nuance into the conversation and just to really recenter on what exactly is being proposed and how it differs from

476
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:24,231
[SPEAKER_03]: the idea that we have in our heads about what rent control is or must be, I think that that'll be where we get a lot of really productive work done.

477
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:30,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate raising some of the details around what we mean when we say just cause eviction.

478
00:48:30,634 --> 00:48:47,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that as we continue to enter into the details of this process, whether we're talking about just cause eviction or whether we're talking about really finessing the styles and levers around the specific numbers and exemptions and conditions around rent stabilization,

479
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:57,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that we can, I think that we'll have a really quick conversation around the nuance and how to, again, make this something that is more helpful than not.

480
00:48:58,429 --> 00:49:19,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that grounding this in the overall context of how big of a problem displacement is in Medford and how increasing housing supply is deeply crucial and the council is very enmeshed in that work and it can never be fast enough to deal with the displacement that we have been seeing for years and continue to see.

481
00:49:20,064 --> 00:49:23,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we just have to challenge ourselves to do more than one thing at a time.

482
00:49:24,106 --> 00:49:29,930
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate everybody being a part of this conversation from the outset and trying to help us do that as well as we can.

483
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:38,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to make a motion to recirculate the background information.

484
00:49:41,824 --> 00:49:58,124
[SPEAKER_03]: sample Home Rule Petition from Somerville and first draft of our Home Rule Petition from Medford that was circulated earlier today to all councillors, the Director of the Planning Development and Sustainability Office, to the Senior Planner, Housing Staff Planner,

485
00:50:00,106 --> 00:50:10,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, these will be available on the city website under the report for this committee meeting and to request feedback and comments by February 28th.

486
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:14,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mr. Clerk, I'd be happy to email that language over to you so you have it.

487
00:50:14,897 --> 00:50:22,683
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a motion to recirculate all of the meeting documents to Councilors and staff and request feedback by the 28th.

488
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:31,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we have a motion from Vice President Collins, second from Councilor Callahan.

489
00:50:34,268 --> 00:50:34,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.

490
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:36,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Clerk, would you please call the roll?

491
00:50:38,111 --> 00:50:38,651
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bears.

492
00:50:39,212 --> 00:50:48,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Just before we vote on the motion, Vice President Collins, I just had a question for you on the TOPA, the right to council.

493
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:52,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we gonna look at those at a later date or did we decide we didn't wanna

494
00:50:55,228 --> 00:50:58,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Two home rolls on those?

495
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:05,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I am interested in, I think my next priority would be TOPA.

496
00:51:06,973 --> 00:51:07,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

497
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:09,655
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that that is included in the governing agenda.

498
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:11,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that the others are.

499
00:51:11,576 --> 00:51:13,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

500
00:51:14,077 --> 00:51:21,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think we should maybe give the new proposal that you have drafted a new paper number.

501
00:51:24,296 --> 00:51:25,639
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be my amendment to the motion.

502
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:31,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think we need to, uh, I just I think we're splitting it off now.

503
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:34,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's now a specific proposal.

504
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:41,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Pursuant to the right, like it said, be it resolved for me to discuss the potential drafting of formal petitions on a variety.

505
00:51:41,102 --> 00:51:45,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we have a specific draft on rent stabilization and just cause eviction.

506
00:51:45,904 --> 00:51:51,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could just amend that when it's recirculated to also give it a new paper number, I think that would be great.

507
00:51:55,598 --> 00:52:02,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins made a motion, seconded by Councilor Cal, and President Bears amended the motion.

508
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:06,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, that was a parliamentary procedure for doing that.

509
00:52:07,451 --> 00:52:12,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have to get Vice President Collins' permission to amend the motion, or is that too different?

510
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:13,918
[SPEAKER_08]: If she doesn't object.

511
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:14,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

512
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no objection.

513
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:21,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, do you have the text for that clerk?

514
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:24,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins is gonna email me the text of her motion.

515
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:27,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got most of it down, but she's gonna email me the text.

516
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, in that case, could you please call the roll?

517
00:52:31,434 --> 00:52:31,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

518
00:52:34,637 --> 00:52:35,277
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears?

519
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:35,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

520
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:37,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan?

521
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:38,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

522
00:52:40,182 --> 00:52:41,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scapelli is absent.

523
00:52:42,864 --> 00:52:43,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins?

524
00:52:44,506 --> 00:52:44,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

525
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:47,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Vice Chair Leming.

526
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:49,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, motion passes.

527
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:55,012
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we are right at 7 p.m.

528
00:52:56,452 --> 00:52:57,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any further comment?

529
00:52:57,873 --> 00:52:58,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair Leming.

530
