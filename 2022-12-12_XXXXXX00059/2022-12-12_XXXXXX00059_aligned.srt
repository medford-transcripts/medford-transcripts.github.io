Thank you both so much for joining me today.

11
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,480
I'm wondering if you could introduce yourself just with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,361
Okay.

13
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,242
So my name is Sharlene Douglas.

14
00:00:54,702 --> 00:01:00,724
My pronouns are she and her, and I am the president of the Method Teacher Association.

15
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:12,488
I have been, I taught for 30 years as a co-school educator, and I am finishing out my term as president as a retired teacher, and I'm finishing it out, so it'll be done in June.

16
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:22,524
And so as far as education, you know, I've been in education and I still presently teach at Lesley University as a professor and I'm going into my 20th year at Lesley University.

17
00:01:23,346 --> 00:01:23,666
Great.

18
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:24,047
Thank you.

19
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:26,758
I'm Joanne McKay.

20
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:30,079
I am the financial, oh, I'm sorry, she, her.

21
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:35,240
And I'm the financial secretary for the Medford Teachers Association.

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,101
I teach fourth grade presently, mainly third or fourth grade is always what I've taught.

23
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:41,081
I've taught a few other grades.

24
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:46,002
And I've been teaching in Medford for about 30 years.

25
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:50,963
Been with the union, probably a part of the union for the past 20.

26
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:52,883
So that's, yeah.

27
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:54,415
Thank you.

28
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:54,675
Yeah.

29
00:01:54,695 --> 00:02:02,758
And so we'll just start with our normal question that I ask everyone on the podcast, and then we're going to get into, I think, some content that people are excited to hear about.

30
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:07,580
But if you could both say what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there.

31
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:17,082
So my favorite place to eat is the Real Gusto and you know, some of their Italian cuisine there is very, very good.

32
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:20,904
They have obviously amazing pizza and actually I had my retirement party there.

33
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:23,385
So I like the whole atmosphere.

34
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:27,807
I like the, you know, overlooking the river and it's a great, a great little place.

35
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,328
And so I enjoy eating there.

36
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:30,770
Thank you.

37
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:35,915
So my favorite place to eat, I can't eat at because it's small, but to get takeout, does that count?

38
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:36,996
Yeah.

39
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:37,897
Ronnie's Place.

40
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:41,920
So we love to get Ronnie's Place takeout at the school.

41
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,322
He's right down the street from where we're at, the Roberts Elementary.

42
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:49,067
And actually I taught his oldest son, Giancarlo, was in my class.

43
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,310
I had a loop year, so I had him for two years and I presently have his daughter, Mia, in my class.

44
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:57,894
I know it's around this place, but that's not why I was trying to get out.

45
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:02,537
I actually the food and my favorite thing to eat there is my God, I don't even know.

46
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,437
They have so many.

47
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:06,579
I love them because they're not your traditional takeout.

48
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,401
They have so many like different variations.

49
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:10,462
So, yeah.

50
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:13,223
They're a favorite in our house too for pizza.

51
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:13,523
Yeah.

52
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:15,364
Yeah, they are right there.

53
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:19,746
That's really close to where my sister lives and I go there quite often too.

54
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,186
I really do enjoy it too.

55
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:22,026
It's a great place.

56
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:23,547
Well, thank you so much.

57
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:30,490
So I think we have kind of a lot to maybe cover today, but I'm hoping to talk about the negotiations that are currently going.

58
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,511
So you guys are so generous to give me time early on a Saturday morning.

59
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:38,033
I think it sounds like you're deep in some of the negotiations, but

60
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:54,936
I'm wondering if you could just sort of outline, like give us a picture of kind of how we got here, how this maybe is different than normal negotiations go, any sort of light that you could shed on for people that might not like fully understand the process or what's going on right now would be really helpful.

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:05,198
So myself and Joanne, we negotiated, I mean, I don't even know how many contracts together, maybe I've done at least

62
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:11,260
I mean, 2007, I don't know, maybe eight, nine loads of contracts.

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,703
I mean, I couldn't tell you the number, obviously, of contracts that I've been involved in and negotiating.

64
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:24,129
What, and, you know, we've been able to, you know, always, we've been able to come to an agreement where it doesn't get to, you know, well over a year.

65
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:28,032
This has been, and so it's that, in that respect, it's different.

66
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:31,114
And, you know, we've always, one of the things that, you know, we,

67
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:33,636
You know, we worked through, we would stay late.

68
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:39,862
You know, these negotiations have been pretty scripted, I think, you know, that we're meeting like for two hours and then, you know, we go away.

69
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:47,108
And I think that, that kind of did impact and sometimes, you know, we didn't spend, I don't think we spent good quality time there.

70
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:48,610
Not quality, that's not the right word.

71
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,693
I don't think that sometimes it was, you know, it was a time limit.

72
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:56,716
And I'm not sure if that was the best approach to negotiations.

73
00:04:56,776 --> 00:05:02,981
I think sometimes when you're negotiating, you need to really just, you know, work through and get things done.

74
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:05,423
And I think the time limit had an impact.

75
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:07,444
And I think there was a...

76
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:11,787
There was some, there was some negativity within the group.

77
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:20,393
And I think some of that negativity stemmed from the fact that the unions here in Medford, they sort of a coalition and, you know, we wanted all the same things.

78
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:25,577
And I think that was a big play that, you know, we, we came together 20 something unions.

79
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:28,859
We have a group that negotiates health insurance called the PEC group.

80
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:33,082
So we sort of came together and we said, you know, we're going to try to take a stance that all

81
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:37,285
City employees, school employees were treated fairly and equally.

82
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,066
And I don't think that was taken well.

83
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:44,630
So I think that might've also impacted some of the things that have gone on within these whole negotiations.

84
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,671
But it's, it's, it's been tough.

85
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:49,934
There have been some, a lot of, there's been some negativity.

86
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:51,995
There's been some misrepresentations.

87
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:56,038
Joanne, do you want to add before I go into the no confidence, the whole idea?

88
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:59,159
I think that other contributing factors was COVID.

89
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:02,640
I mean, COVID affects everything, right?

90
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,400
So, you know, we have to meet by Zoom.

91
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,121
Zoom isn't always the best, you know, obviously.

92
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:09,861
We all have experienced that.

93
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,342
And there's nothing like face-to-face, right?

94
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:18,163
So I think you accomplish a lot more in face-to-face and it's definitely more difficult on Zoom.

95
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:21,244
And as Charlene said, the time limit.

96
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:25,725
So in the past when we would negotiate, we would set our dates and we would

97
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:27,545
There was no time limit.

98
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:32,727
So we'd show up, you know, December 3rd at three o'clock and we would go.

99
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:36,728
And sometimes it would be really productive and it would be a four hour session.

100
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:44,630
And then sometimes, you know, we would be an hour in and we'd be frustrated with each other and we'd just decide like, you know what, we have to call it today.

101
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,271
Like we're not getting anywhere today.

102
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,631
We're going to reconvene.

103
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:50,112
So what was difficult for us is ours.

104
00:06:50,372 --> 00:06:52,713
This was a hard, hard stop.

105
00:06:53,433 --> 00:07:03,703
You know, so there were times that you would be kind of on a roll, you know, and then all of a sudden you get like you have to we have 10 minutes, you know, and then it would have to stop, you know.

106
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:13,132
And so for us, was that a you know, a strategy on their point part where they put it off was this reality of, you know, in their defense, they were.

107
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,574
busier than they've ever been before.

108
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:18,157
You know, I mean, it's not it's not all against them.

109
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:21,319
You know, they had so much going on with Covid too, you know.

110
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:27,945
So it's really I think Covid affected it a lot, you know, you know, on both sides, you know.

111
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:29,486
And I also think.

112
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:35,810
that because even amongst our own team, you sort of fight more on COVID and it's not intentionally.

113
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,712
I don't even more fight because you all over speak each other.

114
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,513
You know, it's hard not to over speak each other.

115
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:47,716
When you're in a room together and you're speaking, you know, body language is different and it gets loud on the computer.

116
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:50,638
So you're trying to make your point and you almost over talk someone.

117
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:57,161
Sometimes there's lagging, you know, so then I even think that those computer issues, I mean, Charlene, would you agree sort of add to that?

118
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,262
Absolutely.

119
00:07:58,322 --> 00:07:58,502
Yeah.

120
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:12,451
I, I've often said to Shailene before, like, I'd love to meet these people, like, just for a drink and see how different things would be, you know, because it gets heightened, you know, and I think, you know, that, that, so that, so that's another part of it.

121
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:23,179
And then I also think that what was different this time is typically we've always, we've always negotiated with the superintendent, the lawyer, and one or two other people that, that speak out.

122
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:24,600
And that wasn't the case.

123
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,400
We don't, we don't.

124
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,084
We don't negotiate with the superintendent.

125
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:29,986
It is the assistant superintendent.

126
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:33,912
And the lawyer, what was different this year is the lawyer barely speaks.

127
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:37,397
And he always in the past had a lot to say.

128
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:41,262
And predominantly we only hear from one person.

129
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:43,878
And no one else really says anything.

130
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,580
They interject in between.

131
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,543
Oftentimes the superintendent doesn't speak at all.

132
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:51,165
And there were many times the camera wasn't even on.

133
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:56,110
If she was there, I don't even know if she was there every time.

134
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,592
Yeah, she should be there and her camera was off.

135
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:07,100
it seemed that the assistant superintendent, David Murphy, was really the spokesperson, you know, who did all the speaking for the team.

136
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:08,261
And that was a change.

137
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:15,569
I mean, you know, we always worked with the attorney, the attorney always spoke, and he was silent, absolutely silent.

138
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,011
And so that was a big change.

139
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:19,372
And I think that

140
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:24,334
You know, he knows the history of Medved because he's been around for a long, long time.

141
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:31,736
And I do think that that sense of him not being an active participant, I think that impacted it also.

142
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:35,137
I mean, it's not to say that it, you know, it's bad change.

143
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:36,878
You know, it's a different leadership.

144
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:39,738
But I say, like, I think for us, that was different.

145
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,339
Yeah.

146
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:40,699
Right.

147
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:43,379
You know, and that was a hard, a hard change to get used to.

148
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:43,920
Yeah.

149
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,421
So different people involved in sort of the negotiations this time around, is that

150
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:54,043
Different people involved, obviously, because different people, but just a different dynamic, you know?

151
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:56,984
I mean, we weren't used to a silent superintendent.

152
00:09:57,924 --> 00:10:04,586
You know, in the past, you know, Roy Belson, he was, you know, he was the head of it and he handled it, you know?

153
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:12,449
And so this was different because, you know, for us, we're used to dealing, you know, you, you, you, you know, I tell the kids in my class, like,

154
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:14,070
I'm in charge of you.

155
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:25,076
My principal is in charge of an assistant principal in charge of me, like directors in charge of them, in charge of them, you know, and it's like, you know, I relate it into government, you know, who's in charge of who.

156
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:34,762
So, you know, we had always we've always had the whole like superintendents in charge, you know, I mean, that's been the way it's been forever, like a chain of command or chain of command.

157
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:38,884
So this was a hard flip because it would be like,

158
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:41,698
Why is she not saying anything?

159
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:43,060
Why is nothing being said?

160
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,822
You know, why is the camera not on?

161
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:48,205
You know, until we finally we got used to that after a while.

162
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:51,269
But in the beginning, that was a big change and hard to get used to because it's like.

163
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,494
You know, an authority thing like who has I don't know, it was weird.

164
00:10:56,674 --> 00:10:57,756
Yeah, it was weird.

165
00:10:58,436 --> 00:10:58,637
Yeah.

166
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:02,320
And so I think that was, you know, a huge piece of it.

167
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:13,812
And then, you know, there was the, you know, when we weren't making inroads and we took some actions like, you know, walk-ins and things like that, you know, that was, which is all right to do.

168
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:19,037
And it was almost like that became, like, we were the bad guys, you know.

169
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,719
Would you say that, Joanne?

170
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,901
It was sort of, I don't know if that's the right term.

171
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:28,025
It has just never been us against them.

172
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:33,349
You know, you have some type of us against them when you're, you know, union administration.

173
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:39,655
But I've always felt that up until recently, we really, really worked well together.

174
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:48,002
So, and Charlene will remember when COVID first came out, first came, what you call it, but when it first appeared around,

175
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:53,545
You know, we are hearing about it in the news and then we're hearing, oh, this is getting really bad.

176
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:55,185
And then next thing you know, one day.

177
00:11:56,346 --> 00:12:06,751
Zero hour, we're called up to the high school, you know, you have to come up to high school and they take a couple of elementary people, whatever, they cover our classes, we go up there, we're like, oh, what's going on, you know?

178
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:10,793
And they sit us in the room and they're like, OK, like we're closing school down.

179
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:12,794
You can't even imagine how crazy that was.

180
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:13,675
We're like, what?

181
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,117
So yeah, we got to close school down.

182
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:16,878
How are we going to do this?

183
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:18,119
Like, how are we going to teach the kids?

184
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:21,382
So the union was like, listen, school's down for the kids.

185
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:22,923
The teachers will come.

186
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:24,165
And they were like, what?

187
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:26,006
And we're like, the teachers will come.

188
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:27,508
We'll all come in tomorrow.

189
00:12:27,568 --> 00:12:28,689
Like, it's not bad yet.

190
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,051
If people need to wear masks, it's a scary thing.

191
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:32,232
We need to calm down the teachers.

192
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:33,574
We'll figure this out, you know?

193
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:36,877
And we worked so well together and they were like, oh my God, thank you.

194
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:45,084
And we went around and we, like myself and another teacher, Ellie O'Leary, like we took the elementary, someone else took something and we talked to the teachers.

195
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,967
We met with Diane Caldwell.

196
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:49,548
She was in charge of elementary at the time.

197
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,012
In the morning, early in the morning, like, oh, what can we tell these teachers to do?

198
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:56,235
And then we went building to building and told them like, this is what they're asking you to do.

199
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:57,156
And the teachers were great.

200
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,016
They jump into action.

201
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,518
Of course, no one knew what was going on, right?

202
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:05,007
So off we go and it was great, you know, we're working together.

203
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:08,368
And then next thing you know, we hear like, we're going to be closed down for a bit.

204
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:11,809
And this was before our power Zoom sessions.

205
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:12,770
We never had this before.

206
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,491
And I know this sounds crazy to say we had this five-hour Zoom because now that's commonplace.

207
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:36,122
But I sat at my dining room table and we sat there, myself, Charlene, Diane Caldwell, Bernadette Riccidelli, I think Paulo de Levers, I don't know who else at the time, other union members, and we hashed out straight for five and a half hours, you know, what can we do?

208
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:38,904
Like, how can we work this out with our contract?

209
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:47,446
We're going to need a set of parameters because we want to be as fair as it can be.

210
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:48,888
We know, and we did it.

211
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:51,851
You know, it was like this crazy thing we'd never done before.

212
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:53,032
We worked so well together.

213
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:55,495
There wasn't yelling, there wasn't fighting, there wasn't screaming.

214
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:56,295
We did it.

215
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:57,036
We implemented it.

216
00:13:57,317 --> 00:14:02,762
And then we had to come back together again when things changed, when they said we're staying out even longer.

217
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:03,743
And we did it.

218
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,825
And then Covid continued.

219
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:06,886
And then we had the summer.

220
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:08,987
And then how are we reopening schools?

221
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:11,028
And that was very contentious, if you remember.

222
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,951
That was more contentious of how we did it.

223
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:16,852
And you argued a little.

224
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:17,773
It was fine.

225
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:21,175
And then I don't like we all worked well together.

226
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:21,816
Yeah.

227
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:26,138
And I don't know, with this contract, it it changed.

228
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,568
And I don't, I can never pinpoint why.

229
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:31,510
Is it the leadership?

230
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,732
Is the change of our side stayed the same?

231
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,073
Yeah, we did stay the same.

232
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:48,324
And it was, it was, you know, it's interesting, you know, because when we went in that day and the first time when they say they were closed in the schools and, you know, you know, we insisted that our teachers have time to go back into those schools, get the materials they needed.

233
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:49,806
They went in that day.

234
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:54,310
They went in and it was very, very important, you know, for them because we knew

235
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:59,260
what we didn't know how long, we thought we're gonna be closed for two weeks at the most.

236
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,842
You know, we never anticipated being closed as long as we were.

237
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:08,845
And, you know, when we met and literally we would, I think it was a Saturday, we met on all of us.

238
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:10,686
And I think it was longer than five hours.

239
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:14,088
I thought it was more like six, like seven hours.

240
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:18,391
We just worked it out with the minister, you know, with some of the administration.

241
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,552
For some reason with administration, it's,

242
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:24,014
There's a lot of arguing.

243
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:24,874
We know we don't.

244
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:26,835
So I don't know why.

245
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:32,497
So what I'm hearing is like typically the negotiations are with like a smaller team of people than is.

246
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,779
And right now it sounds like school committees involved, which includes the mayor, like you.

247
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,901
Or they're not involved.

248
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:45,323
OK, that this is a question that I've had, like I said, because I hear a lot about like, how can we pressure our school committee members?

249
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,763
What like what?

250
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:48,324
So, yeah, where are we now?

251
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:50,745
I heard I also heard things about like going to DSEE.

252
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:55,486
And so I guess anything that you can do to kind of like demystify what's happening.

253
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:58,988
Yeah, if I could start.

254
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:04,491
So basically the negotiations teams, everyone gets to choose who is on representative of their teams.

255
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:09,553
Our contract is between the school committee and the mayor.

256
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:14,295
Obviously the mayor was the chair of the school committee, have the final, they vote, okay?

257
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:16,416
And they can put their representatives in charge.

258
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:20,478
What we had asked for is that we knew we weren't making inroads.

259
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:24,480
So we did ask for the school committee and the mayor to be part of this.

260
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,161
Um, they did reach out.

261
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:28,641
I think it was in June.

262
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:31,362
I'd have to pull my letter and I could give you the exact date in a minute.

263
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:38,223
But in June, you know, the, when we were really on a struggle, the mayor did reach out to me and ask for a meeting.

264
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:46,825
And I thought that meeting, because from my emails, my understanding of the meeting was, was going to be by myself and the, and I didn't know who else was even going to be there.

265
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:49,066
As a matter of fact, my co-respondent, Mr. Murphy,

266
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,466
I even asked him, will you be there?

267
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:52,607
He goes, I don't believe so.

268
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:53,567
I don't think so.

269
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:56,688
So, and myself and our MTA rep, great.

270
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:03,229
So at that meeting, you know, all of a sudden we were, there was everyone in their team and that's when Ms.

271
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:06,830
Graham, member of the committee showed up and it was just myself and Greg.

272
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,991
So we were, I was like, well, my whole team isn't here.

273
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:15,092
And they did, I think they did, they did a proposal at that meeting for us, but it wasn't my whole team.

274
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:19,253
So we, I don't feel that we negotiated because my whole team.

275
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:20,980
That was an off-the-record meeting.

276
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:29,569
So that is the only true meeting that they have been at.

277
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:37,855
So we've been asking for them to attend, to hear, and to make sure that we wanted them to hear our voices.

278
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:39,977
And we didn't, that hasn't happened.

279
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:46,482
And I think, Joanne, if you wanna highlight anything I'm missing, but that's the, there's the frustration on our part.

280
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:51,286
You have on Monday, the school committee saying that they've been there at multiple meetings.

281
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:58,650
You know, the school committee, I literally went back, myself and LEA, one of the members, and I said, did I mess up?

282
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,251
Because you begin to question yourself.

283
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:01,212
I said, did I mess up?

284
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:02,192
Were they there?

285
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:15,400
And we went through our attendance records and, you know, because we have to keep, I mean, part of the bargaining rules is we have to keep accurate notes in bargaining history, because that all plays into the contract, even after it's when it's ratified.

286
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,502
So we did go back, we did check, and

287
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:20,703
That's the best of my knowledge.

288
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:29,426
Now, they were at when we were negotiating for COVID, the COVID MOA, it was very different than the actual bargain.

289
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:37,650
OK, so we were still negotiating a COVID, a final COVID MOA and at the beginning of last school year.

290
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,190
OK.

291
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,761
Correct, Joanne?

292
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:40,161
Yes.

293
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:41,182
We're analyzing it.

294
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:41,623
Yeah.

295
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:47,989
And also, so the other thing is, is that a lot of people don't understand with negotiation.

296
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:56,577
When you negotiate, you come with a whole list of things, and you know there are things you aren't going to get, and they know things they aren't going to get, and you hash them out.

297
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:02,704
But what you have is something occasionally called an off the record.

298
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:16,352
You know, so you do and really, you know, you feel like you've made some progress and, you know, the mayor is obviously the head of the city and she's the ones that holds the financial purse strings, so to say.

299
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:21,595
So oftentimes you might have an off the record where they feel like, hey, at this point,

300
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:23,756
everything else is pretty good.

301
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:27,278
Let's just pull to the side and just be like, look, can we get this done?

302
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:36,103
You know, if we offered you and you kind of the purpose of an off the record is sort of, I don't know, Shailene, would you kind of just show your hands on what your bottom line is?

303
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:45,368
You know, like instead of like having six sessions where we go, you know, five, five, five, one, one, one, five, three points, like, you know what I mean?

304
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:47,449
Like you finally just like, oh, what's bottom line here?

305
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:48,870
You know, like, can we cut to the chase?

306
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,190
Right.

307
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,771
So that was off the record.

308
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:51,551
Right.

309
00:19:51,831 --> 00:20:01,555
That is not, that was not an official, you know, recorded where we take notes, where we, you know, so to say they came to negotiations, like, no, you didn't.

310
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:02,235
Hmm.

311
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:07,397
You called a meeting, I reckon meeting and, and you had one representative with you.

312
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:08,197
You didn't come.

313
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,958
And we, we have publicly.

314
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:18,201
call them out, ask them to come many times, you know, and to say like, this is not going, like, we need you there.

315
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:18,801
And they don't come.

316
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:33,408
So the newest, you know, obviously at the last school committee meeting, one of the members made a motion, Paolo Russo made a motion that someone from the school committee be there, you know, and that passed.

317
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:45,662
So the mayor was there and it's funny because we knew, I mean, I, in my head knew no one else was coming with the mayor, but I don't feel like she was the representative because.

318
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:48,365
They had already called the meeting.

319
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:49,966
I don't know, how can you explain that, Charlene?

320
00:20:49,986 --> 00:21:02,028
Charlene and her- So basically, basically what I had done is, you know, I had written to the mayor saying that, you know, that what they had proposed, I had done a poll and it's not going to pass.

321
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:08,870
So we can't, and we already, so I think we need to back and, you know, back up a little bit here for people to understand.

322
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,911
So from the school committee and this whole, well, maybe not.

323
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:15,872
So it had not, the ratification vote didn't pass.

324
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:18,732
We have to now go back.

325
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:19,533
Okay.

326
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:25,014
So we went back and we asked to renegotiate and there was some nastiness back and forth with that.

327
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:36,817
And then, you know, I reached out to her and I did, you know, say in my letter, please show, you know, and, and, and we had presented a proposal and we were looking for a counter and the counter was nothing.

328
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:39,018
So, but we really wanted something.

329
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:46,460
Can you say what the like elements were that weren't, that like didn't pass or like what the things you wanted to change in the counter offer?

330
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:54,198
So we had two, okay, so let me, I think it's important people understand that.

331
00:21:55,183 --> 00:22:00,707
By law, okay, there's laws that we have to obey when we negotiate contracts.

332
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:12,555
By law, we, and even in our grounds and in the law, there is rules that all contracts that negotiated by the negotiations team are brought back to the members.

333
00:22:13,175 --> 00:22:14,816
That's called a tentative agreement.

334
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,498
And the word tentative means it's tentative.

335
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:17,638
We don't have an agreement yet.

336
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:18,919
Hopefully it will pass.

337
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,580
And usually it does by 90%.

338
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:32,731
When we went to our members to present it, and we did, and we supported it, and big MTA supported it, came out, even one of the bigger people from MTA supported that and said that it's very important.

339
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,293
We think it's a fair and honest deal.

340
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:35,634
Our members didn't think so.

341
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:37,476
There were issues that they didn't like.

342
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:43,418
Um, there was an issue about the implementation of changing the Wednesdays and what that would look like.

343
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:46,358
And they didn't, there wasn't, the language wasn't strong enough on that.

344
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:51,879
And so they really felt that they didn't, and there was a trust that it was a sense of trust.

345
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,380
They didn't trust the district to implement it properly.

346
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
And so that was one of the big things.

347
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,480
And the other thing was compensation.

348
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,441
There were two major issues.

349
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:02,361
So they told us loud and clear, it didn't pass.

350
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,222
We notified them immediately that it didn't pass and.

351
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:11,625
That meant that that tender agreement now no longer exists.

352
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:20,432
Even though I initialed it, which is what I have to do, and so did the superintendent, that TA is no longer, if it's not ratified, it doesn't exist.

353
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:25,555
The fact that what they're doing is actually almost illegal, it is illegal.

354
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,139
stating that we still have a tentative agreement.

355
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:32,921
You know, we don't have a tentative agreement.

356
00:23:33,301 --> 00:23:35,443
Even the mediator has stated that we don't.

357
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:43,108
And that's why we did when we did our action letter, we asked the mayor, you know, responded and said, we have a tentative agreement.

358
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:44,509
You know, people were like questioning that.

359
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:45,330
And I asked her to

360
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,553
cease and desist and to, you know, withdraw that.

361
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:49,134
She didn't.

362
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:58,103
So we did file a charge with the Department of Labor Relations, you know, that that's bad faith bargaining and that's not, and that's against the law.

363
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,145
Ratification laws are there.

364
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:08,674
And if you, if you look even just recently, I think Melrose reached a tentative agreement and it says, a tentative agreement to be ratified by both

365
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:12,015
the school committee and the membership.

366
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:15,257
So until it's ratified, it doesn't go into effect.

367
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,398
And if it doesn't, you're back at the table.

368
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:29,103
And I also think that, I think the tough thing was is, you know, what the community needs to know is that, you know, we're the representatives of our teachers.

369
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:33,365
You know, we can't say what they're going to say yes or no to.

370
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,805
We do talk to them.

371
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:35,426
We think.

372
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:42,488
And, you know, so on their side, they said, well, you said that this was a strong offer and this was this was good.

373
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:43,508
This was good.

374
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,729
And we said we did.

375
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:49,030
We did say that because we heard how much you were going to give us.

376
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,491
You gave a little bit more.

377
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,011
You did something a little differently.

378
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:57,013
And we thought based on what they say they're going to give us, like this is the best they're going to give us.

379
00:24:57,213 --> 00:24:57,513
Right.

380
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:57,813
Right.

381
00:24:57,953 --> 00:24:58,853
Like this is good.

382
00:24:58,913 --> 00:24:59,774
People should accept this.

383
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:02,895
We're going to vote again and we're going to renegotiate another year.

384
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:03,855
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

385
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:05,996
You know, and we're going to bring it back.

386
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:07,858
And then for the elementary.

387
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:14,883
And again, I'm I'm actually not blaming Medford on this because it happened really quick at the end.

388
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:15,343
Right.

389
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:23,409
And the the elementary language we had tied into the money, like, you're not getting the Wednesdays unless we can do something with the compensation.

390
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:23,969
And then.

391
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,891
When it all came down in the end, you can imagine it comes pretty quick, right?

392
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,493
Because now it's like, let's get this done, let's get this done.

393
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:39,117
And through no fault of them, through no fault of us, even maybe, maybe it is through fault of us that we didn't put stronger language, but...

394
00:25:39,797 --> 00:25:46,141
Prior in the contract, when we tried to put something in the language, we were told, you don't put language like that in the contract, right?

395
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:48,743
Because we had talked about a class size for something.

396
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:50,504
You don't put language like that in a contract.

397
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:53,687
We do that because that's in the best interest of the children.

398
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:58,870
That's not something, if you put things like that in the contract all the time, the contract would be, you know, huge.

399
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:03,894
So that's something we work out because that's in the best interest of the children.

400
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:04,754
And so,

401
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,283
It all did happen quick and we didn't put parameters on the Wednesdays.

402
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:10,043
Okay.

403
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:15,389
When it all rolled out, elementary was like, what?

404
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,133
You know, not that they don't want to give up that Wednesday.

405
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:25,399
It is for, you know, we agree better for the children to be there longer, but there were no guidelines around it.

406
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,742
And unfortunately there's a trust issue.

407
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:37,044
So now people are like, you know, I'm not going to trust what's going to happen when when the kids don't have their specialists, because we're getting out at 12 now once a month.

408
00:26:37,084 --> 00:26:39,064
And how is my prep time going to be made up?

409
00:26:39,124 --> 00:26:41,505
And I don't even get prep time now, like just all these issues.

410
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:42,745
And what are they going to do about lunch?

411
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:44,305
And what are they going to do about bus duty?

412
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:45,425
And what are they going to do about this?

413
00:26:45,946 --> 00:26:52,327
And all of a sudden, things a lot of people didn't think of our side, didn't think of their side, didn't think of in the whole thing, you know.

414
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:57,368
And I've said to Charlene before, we can take blame, a little blame that, too, you know.

415
00:26:57,768 --> 00:26:57,908
And.

416
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:01,588
the administration did respond well to that.

417
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:02,809
You would agree, Charlene?

418
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:03,309
Absolutely.

419
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,030
Absolutely.

420
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,772
Like, all right, fix this, we'll put some parameters in, you know?

421
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:14,395
So then we went back with them that basically we had two issues, the elementary issue and the compensation issue.

422
00:27:14,695 --> 00:27:17,517
And they did, they worked very well with the elementary issue.

423
00:27:17,657 --> 00:27:19,318
And I think they too

424
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:26,460
said, wow, OK, yeah, we didn't think of that, you know, and we put together schedules and said, like, look, how would you move?

425
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,681
Because we have these things called wind blocks where kids get extra help and we're on a block scheduling.

426
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:39,144
And we're like, if we lose a specialist and lose the prep, like here's the only time you could take to make it up for us, you know, like because our schedules are crazy.

427
00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:42,985
Kids are pulled up, you know, and I think administration was like, oh,

428
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:44,045
Yeah.

429
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:46,706
You know, okay, we need to make some changes.

430
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:48,487
They were very open to that, you know?

431
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,547
And they did, and they worked with us with that.

432
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:51,848
It was excellent, actually.

433
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:53,028
It was excellent.

434
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,289
And it was very productive.

435
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:56,369
There was no arguing.

436
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:57,450
It was great, you know?

437
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,491
And then our other thing was, and the compensation, they don't like the compensation.

438
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:03,772
And at that point, it's where things got bad.

439
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:06,353
They were like, you even said this was a strong offer.

440
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,554
We're like, okay, we did because it was the strongest offer you were giving us.

441
00:28:09,594 --> 00:28:10,094
So we did.

442
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:12,015
We went back to our members and we said,

443
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:15,497
This is the strongest offer, like, we think it's a good deal.

444
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:16,298
You should take it.

445
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:25,666
But the member said, no, no, it's not what's going on in other communities, not what we're teaching is like now, not as what we're dealing with after the pandemic.

446
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:29,229
You know, it's not it's not enough to show value.

447
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:34,213
And this is where our problem is, because I think they don't believe

448
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:38,866
that we brought back that offer in good faith, that first call.

449
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:40,727
That's what's being insinuated.

450
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:44,147
And that we didn't do our job to get it ratified.

451
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,968
And that's disheartening because we did.

452
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:53,950
And we have members that said, geez, after that Zoom call, I feel like they were pressuring us to vote yes.

453
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,891
People said to me, they were telling us all these terrible things.

454
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:00,413
If you don't say yes, and it's almost like they were bullying us to say yes.

455
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:02,175
I said, well, they weren't bullying you to say yes.

456
00:29:02,755 --> 00:29:08,860
We brought back a thing that we want ratified, and they need to let you know everything that can happen if you don't say yes.

457
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:16,226
And then for them, for administration to say we didn't do our job, it's like, the members spoke.

458
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:18,427
Sure.

459
00:29:18,768 --> 00:29:19,028
Wow.

460
00:29:19,848 --> 00:29:20,809
And that's part of the process.

461
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:21,990
That's the democratic process.

462
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:31,196
So that negotiating that you're describing around changing with the Wednesdays, has that happened since the, that happened like very recently?

463
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:34,799
That happened after we didn't ratify the contract.

464
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:39,202
We got back together and they were willing to work with that, but they were only willing to work on the elementary.

465
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:42,419
And it was always no to money.

466
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:44,541
It was never even discussed.

467
00:29:44,661 --> 00:29:51,366
I mean, you know, on October 25th, my discussion, you know, I'd said the two issues and it was, no, you understand, we're not gonna talk money.

468
00:29:51,386 --> 00:29:52,967
And I said, I understand that, but it's still an issue.

469
00:29:52,987 --> 00:29:56,409
You understand, we're not, I said, I get what you're saying, but it's going to be an issue.

470
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:02,834
And, you know, and even, you know, when we met that day, that Wednesday face-to-face, you know, I said, do you know that we're not gonna talk money?

471
00:30:02,854 --> 00:30:03,594
And I said, yes.

472
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:04,715
And I told my members that.

473
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:08,218
And I said, and I told them that, but I'm gonna let, at that point, I let,

474
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:17,060
Some of the other members on the team really addressed the same voice because my voice they weren't hearing, I didn't think, so I felt that it needed a couple of other members on that team.

475
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,340
So they didn't hear that.

476
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:27,962
I can't imagine what it's like to negotiate salary in such a public way and like, and that feeling so linked to like your value and your job and your value in the community.

477
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:35,624
I wonder like, what, like, what do you, like, what do you think the solution is to the, to the money issue?

478
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:45,272
So I don't think, you know, we're not, you know, I think, first of all, I think we're in very different times too.

479
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:52,574
I mean, you're looking around and, you know, teachers, the profession is definitely, it's changed, you know, in all the years.

480
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,595
So I think that, you know, we've, we've.

481
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:57,575
We've made reasonable offers.

482
00:30:57,595 --> 00:31:01,116
I mean, we just want something that's fair and equitable.

483
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:03,657
And it's very, very important.

484
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:10,419
And, you know, other communities, you know, we posted the raises they're getting, you know, and ours isn't close to that.

485
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:19,221
And I think, you know, one of the things that was the members were very, very concerned about in that year was when we negotiated our package, it was

486
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:33,487
You know, it was an eight, it was stated, it was an 8.5, but the last 1% wouldn't take effect until the year after our, you wouldn't see it actually until the year after our contract.

487
00:31:33,847 --> 00:31:39,730
Right, you wouldn't get it on the last day, but you really wouldn't see that until when you came back in your first paycheck.

488
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:46,573
Okay, so what happens there is that the membership saw it as, you know, not an 8.0, they were concerned.

489
00:31:46,953 --> 00:31:48,894
And they were very concerned about that.

490
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:55,677
And I think their concerns were heard when, you know, it was presented at Monday's school committee that that 8.5 is really a 7.6.

491
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:57,658
So right.

492
00:31:57,738 --> 00:31:59,839
And so the other thing, too, is like our members.

493
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:04,341
So our members tell us, like, we're not going to take less than a certain.

494
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:04,981
Right.

495
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:10,464
And and so we go in there knowing that they're not going to take less.

496
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:13,485
Well, they say they're not going to take less than a certain amount.

497
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:14,706
They're looking for a certain amount.

498
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:14,946
Right.

499
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,981
And so what we brought back was less than the CERN.

500
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:20,602
And sometimes that happens, right?

501
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:25,064
Okay, because we don't hold the purse strings, but it was close, right?

502
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:32,668
But not really, because 8.5 was close to what we want, but not really because they're giving it on the last day, right?

503
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:36,989
So now it's not really what we want, plus we don't see it that whole year.

504
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:42,672
So what we mean on the last day is on the last day of school, you have a salary scale.

505
00:32:42,912 --> 00:32:44,233
So on the last day of school,

506
00:32:45,053 --> 00:32:49,695
your salary for the next year will go up one percent, which means you got none of that money in your pocket.

507
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:53,517
OK, but you will start the next year one percent higher.

508
00:32:53,997 --> 00:32:54,437
OK, great.

509
00:32:54,457 --> 00:33:05,222
Well, if you're a brand new teacher making fifty two thousand dollars, right, you're going to get five hundred and twenty dollars into your full year schedule the next year.

510
00:33:06,182 --> 00:33:07,703
Break that over 26 checks.

511
00:33:08,463 --> 00:33:10,624
It's not a lot of money, right?

512
00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:11,024
Yeah.

513
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:11,785
Plus.

514
00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:17,694
Plus, then the next time we negotiate, because this has happened in the past, what's their answer going to be?

515
00:33:17,994 --> 00:33:19,116
We just gave you one percent.

516
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:19,657
Hmm.

517
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:25,046
So that's the fear of the members that it's going to carry over to be like, well, we just gave you one percent.

518
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:25,747
Yeah.

519
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:27,048
So now we're only going to give you maybe two.

520
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:28,829
Now we're only going to give you two.

521
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:29,530
Right.

522
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,552
Well, we're only going to give you one because real quickly now you're getting a 2% raise.

523
00:33:32,912 --> 00:33:33,172
Right.

524
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:37,795
So these are the- I feel like we're on the last day because it's going to carry into the next year.

525
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,937
And that's the result.

526
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:45,060
So you're negotiating a contract that has been expired for over a year, is that right?

527
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:46,650
Yeah.

528
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,071
June of twenty one.

529
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:49,072
You're.

530
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:50,333
Yeah, absolutely.

531
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:50,673
Right.

532
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:51,153
Yeah.

533
00:33:51,454 --> 00:33:54,195
And so when is the next when would you when would you.

534
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:56,337
So it's fine.

535
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:58,378
August 31st, twenty twenty one.

536
00:33:58,879 --> 00:33:59,799
So and then.

537
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,340
So we're up again.

538
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:02,541
That's three years.

539
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:06,704
So hit twenty twenty to twenty twenty.

540
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,886
So we got twenty twenty one, twenty twenty two, twenty twenty two, twenty twenty three.

541
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:14,810
And then the 23, 24 school year, and then we're up again.

542
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,712
So we're going into our second year without a contract.

543
00:34:17,772 --> 00:34:20,493
We'll be right back at the table again in a year.

544
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:20,914
Right.

545
00:34:21,054 --> 00:34:25,436
So next spring, we'll technically, not this year, but...

546
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:34,360
In the last year of the contract, that spring, we'll request to meet again to start negotiations.

547
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:41,443
You know, so it will only be one working year before we're back at negotiating again.

548
00:34:43,193 --> 00:34:49,277
You know, and so that's been, you know, that's been, you know, and there's a concern about, you know, money.

549
00:34:49,297 --> 00:35:01,585
I mean, you know, the city, you know, with the money and, you know, we have the ESSER funds and the district has come out and school committee has come out and said, you can't use those ESSER funds to maintain teachers.

550
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:05,428
We've shown them documentation, legal, you know, documentation from

551
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:09,411
you know, all over and other schools are using that money.

552
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:12,193
So that money is there to do that.

553
00:35:12,553 --> 00:35:14,254
And they keep saying they can't do that.

554
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:19,218
And that is, you know, from the education, Cardoza has stated that.

555
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:22,540
So those are, you know, in the Chapter 70 money.

556
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:25,763
I mean, you know, the district is saying they're not going to get the Chapter 70 money.

557
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,044
Well, they got it this year.

558
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:32,506
And the new elected governor, Healy, has said, we're putting that money in.

559
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:42,070
So Medford is scheduled to get that Chapter 70 money over the next years, which would be anywhere, I think, up to $5 million of that.

560
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:51,153
And then we just worked really, really hard to get passage of the millionaire's tax, as you know, MTA, so to get more monies into our schools.

561
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:55,895
And we have the elected body there of the school committee who are,

562
00:35:56,395 --> 00:36:07,177
you know, progressives and have stated that, you know, they supported question one, they supported the various questions, but then they're saying something very, very different.

563
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:09,118
They're saying, no, we don't have that money.

564
00:36:09,158 --> 00:36:12,499
Well, then why do we do all this fighting for?

565
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:14,619
And why is that, and that money is there.

566
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:20,180
And that's another big frustration for us, you know, and for them.

567
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,041
I mean, and even for their political stance, it's confusing.

568
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:33,088
Yeah, I can hear that maybe part of the answer you're getting is like, we don't have this money or that's not part of the budget that we're going to allocate to teachers.

569
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:38,252
And the budget is sort of a statement of your values in the same way, right?

570
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:47,920
Like if we care about education, if we care about teachers and the way that we've had to lean on teachers and education throughout COVID, how do we not adjust the budget in order to meet these needs, right?

571
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:50,654
Exactly.

572
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:56,902
And that's very and that's how the members of Philly and it's, you know, you know, enjoying you can agree with me.

573
00:36:57,142 --> 00:36:57,342
Right.

574
00:36:57,603 --> 00:37:04,532
And the reason we're asking for, I think a big sticking point that when we first came in, you know, we we shot high.

575
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:04,812
Right.

576
00:37:05,012 --> 00:37:06,374
So you're always going to shoot high.

577
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:07,475
Right.

578
00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:09,036
Because you're going to negotiate.

579
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:09,256
Right.

580
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:10,137
They're going to come in low.

581
00:37:10,277 --> 00:37:12,598
We're going to come high and you're going to meet somewhere in the middle.

582
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:12,858
Right.

583
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:20,303
But they were they were highly offended by our high, which is six, six, six.

584
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:22,164
But that was the rate of inflation.

585
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:23,325
I didn't like that.

586
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:24,986
So we came with six, six, six.

587
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:26,447
And they thought that was ridiculous.

588
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:29,388
And we're like, the inflation rate is eight percent.

589
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:29,649
Right.

590
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:32,130
I mean, prices are ridiculous.

591
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,391
Look at how much it costs everywhere you go.

592
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:34,751
Right.

593
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:39,053
So we, we honestly didn't think that was ridiculous.

594
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:48,058
You know, did we know we were going to, we, we know we weren't going to get six, six, six, but we knew we would come down a little bit and we thought, wouldn't it be great if we got 12, right?

595
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:48,858
Like, wouldn't that be great.

596
00:37:49,178 --> 00:37:50,539
That'd be fantastic if we got 12.

597
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,101
And you know, now it's, it's not anywhere close.

598
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:56,302
It's, it's basically what, what Cal,

599
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:17,327
And we deserve it.

600
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:18,869
I mean, we work hard.

601
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,771
It's hard.

602
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:21,755
It's challenging to be a teacher nowadays.

603
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:24,419
Kids have a lot of issues now after COVID.

604
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:28,344
We deserve it.

605
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:29,005
Yeah.

606
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:32,747
And teachers don't just, you know, work, you know, you know, the eight to two.

607
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:41,433
I mean, everyone knows the teachers, you know, the elementary teachers this week, you know, they're they're working on their preps to meet with parents during the report card conferences.

608
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,014
They're they're staying later after school.

609
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:45,375
They're coming in before school.

610
00:38:45,715 --> 00:38:51,399
You know, all those things, because they really do want to be, you know, there for the for the

611
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,220
for the children.

612
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,705
And even yesterday after our standout, everybody went right back into that building, right back to work.

613
00:38:58,066 --> 00:38:59,147
And they didn't miss a beat.

614
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:00,488
They never missed a beat.

615
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:02,850
And that's what people need to understand.

616
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,651
They haven't.

617
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:04,972
They haven't missed.

618
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:07,575
These teachers in Method have not missed a beat.

619
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:08,576
They have not.

620
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:14,983
During COVID, during whatever, I mean, we were the ones, and people, you know, our memories are not as long.

621
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:21,026
It was the union who clearly stated, we need to go into the school.

622
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:22,868
We need to get our materials.

623
00:39:23,168 --> 00:39:24,048
We need time.

624
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:28,991
We need to be ready when we meet the kids that Monday, whatever that looks like.

625
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:31,413
You know, I don't even, it was ridiculous.

626
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,494
I don't even know how we ended up getting packets and things.

627
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:39,938
Joanne, weren't you about putting packets together and delivering them to people's houses and driving around the city?

628
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:40,839
I mean, you,

629
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,340
We needed that time.

630
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,581
And they wanted to shut the buildings and not even let us in.

631
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:45,761
And we were like, oh, no, no, no, no.

632
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:46,902
We need to go back.

633
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,242
We need to go in.

634
00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:53,625
And even the school committee, when they voted to shut the door, they forgot.

635
00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:55,406
And I was like to the lawyer, I said, we got to go.

636
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:55,866
Oh, yeah.

637
00:39:55,886 --> 00:39:58,307
And they said, oh, yes, yes, we'll fix that.

638
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:01,729
Because I know everybody was in a state of shock, but that's how important it is.

639
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:09,813
Teachers go into this profession and, you know, a teacher myself and Joanne, you know, we didn't go in for it.

640
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:14,436
We don't expect, we're not going to make the money a CEO makes or even a superintendent makes.

641
00:40:14,476 --> 00:40:20,219
We know that, you know, we know that in the classroom that you're going to have to work a lot harder.

642
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:26,843
But we also want to be respected and not live in a way that we can't make ends meet.

643
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:30,926
I mean, 37 years as an educator, I have never not worked

644
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:35,990
two and three jobs, never, to make ends meet.

645
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,171
Joanne works.

646
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,013
I mean, you know, all of us do.

647
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:41,695
I mean, that's just, you know, that's the way it is.

648
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:45,679
But I think people after COVID and everything like, oh my God, this has got to stop.

649
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:53,627
You know, if we want people to go into this profession, then we need to give them the money that they truly, truly deserve.

650
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:56,188
They work just as hard as anybody in college.

651
00:40:56,448 --> 00:40:57,908
You get your master's degree.

652
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:00,449
Those courses are tough.

653
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:01,729
I teach those courses.

654
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:07,251
They're tough courses and you have to know theories.

655
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:08,251
It's a lot.

656
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:21,555
I'm wondering quickly, I know I've taken a lot of your time, but if you could just describe your hopes for the Boy With No Confidence and then anything that the community could know, like how we can support you, how we can sort of prep and plan for the next round of negotiations.

657
00:41:23,854 --> 00:41:29,261
I mean, I think I hope this is my own personal event.

658
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:31,924
Why people said, why did you do a vote or no confidence?

659
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:33,325
What was your reason for that?

660
00:41:33,446 --> 00:41:40,133
And I think our reason was to let the community know, like, it's not going well and we need your help.

661
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:54,311
you know and we have no confidence in the way things are going and we need pressure because listen what does it come down to if these people want to to continue their jobs they need the votes right and so they need the community to say like

662
00:41:55,098 --> 00:42:01,065
Come on, help these teachers, we believe in the teachers, they need more, figure it out, get creative.

663
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:05,591
Again, what we're asking for is not unreasonable.

664
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:09,356
And I can hold my head high and say that, I really can.

665
00:42:10,357 --> 00:42:12,960
We're not sticking on, oh, okay, Medford's that.

666
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:20,903
this 7.5 one on the, you know, with the one on the last day of school and we're holding fast and we're saying like, we want 12%, we want 12%.

667
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:24,024
We're not like, you know, we're 4% off, 5% off.

668
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:24,564
Ridiculous.

669
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:25,284
We're not going to do it.

670
00:42:25,524 --> 00:42:26,905
Like we're so close.

671
00:42:26,965 --> 00:42:30,946
It's, it's, it's, it's frustrating because

672
00:42:31,826 --> 00:42:33,367
That's the thing we want people to know.

673
00:42:33,487 --> 00:42:35,509
We're not asking for something ridiculous.

674
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:41,013
And it's like we're told all the time, like this is for the kids and this is hurting the kids.

675
00:42:41,614 --> 00:42:43,275
And what you're doing is hurting the kids.

676
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:44,136
So stop.

677
00:42:44,616 --> 00:42:45,157
Then stop.

678
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:45,897
Then you stop.

679
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:47,138
You give us what we need.

680
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:48,219
We deserve it.

681
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:50,721
If it's so close like this, then stop.

682
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:51,482
Figure it out.

683
00:42:51,562 --> 00:42:52,803
You can figure it out.

684
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:54,424
Get creative with that.

685
00:42:54,524 --> 00:42:54,984
Ask for money.

686
00:42:55,785 --> 00:42:57,046
It's a lot of money out there.

687
00:42:57,186 --> 00:42:58,227
You can make this happen.

688
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:01,190
So when you say we're hurting the kids, we're not hurting the kids.

689
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,711
We're fighting for respect.

690
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:06,194
We're fighting for I believe we're fighting for less than we deserve.

691
00:43:06,514 --> 00:43:06,774
Yeah.

692
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:17,963
Well, it's also interesting, like when we see you all out there in the beginning of the school day, what kind of conversations that opens to have with kids about like people advocating for what they need.

693
00:43:18,024 --> 00:43:18,244
Right.

694
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:21,206
And like just I think there's some lessons there, educational.

695
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:26,891
So I find what's interesting is when we when we turn around to go in, because, you know, we'll stop.

696
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:29,013
We have to be at my, you know, elementary level.

697
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:30,574
We have to be in our classes at 830.

698
00:43:31,054 --> 00:43:33,616
So someone's always the watchkeeper, 825.

699
00:43:33,997 --> 00:43:36,639
And we'll be like, but, you know, we all turn around and we walk through.

700
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:39,041
So at the Roberts, you know, there's that underpass.

701
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:40,502
And when we walk through the kids like.

702
00:43:40,862 --> 00:43:45,046
Teachers, teachers, and they're high-fiving us and stuff on the way by.

703
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:46,668
And it's so funny, you know.

704
00:43:46,828 --> 00:43:49,551
And they don't really understand what's going on, you know.

705
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,412
And we don't tell them.

706
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:51,973
And they say, what are you doing out there?

707
00:43:52,013 --> 00:43:55,757
We say, well, you know, we just we don't have a contract and we're trying to get a fair contract.

708
00:43:55,777 --> 00:44:00,262
But it's funny that the kids are high-fiving, well, teachers, they're for us, you know.

709
00:44:00,362 --> 00:44:03,545
Who's a bigger celebrity to an elementary schooler than a teacher?

710
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,082
And I agree with exactly what Joanne said.

711
00:44:09,322 --> 00:44:12,404
We're not, we're not asking, you know, you know, we're not asking for 12.

712
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:20,048
We're not asking for, you know, we, we came back and you, you know, that we said it was cost neutral and they disagree, you know, so.

713
00:44:20,169 --> 00:44:21,870
It's not budget neutral.

714
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:25,311
It is cost neutral, but it's not budget neutral, but like get creative.

715
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:32,876
You can get creative and you can move around and ask for funds and you can, and we have a mediator and we did talk to the mediator about that.

716
00:44:33,816 --> 00:44:37,457
And you know, ESSER funds can be used for a lot of things.

717
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:39,898
So if you have a budget, right?

718
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:47,039
You have a budget that comes out of the city and then you have these ESSER funds that you can use and you're saying, we can't use these ESSER funds for your salary.

719
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:47,919
Okay.

720
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:51,200
There are a lot of things in this budget you can use those ESSER things for.

721
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,320
So get creative.

722
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:52,981
Yeah.

723
00:44:53,181 --> 00:44:53,501
Okay.

724
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:54,401
Get creative.

725
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:56,081
I'm going to give you a little analogy.

726
00:44:56,801 --> 00:44:58,042
I waitress, right?

727
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:02,643
And so you have certain sections, you know, and then sometimes

728
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:06,686
Someone that has a reservation isn't going to show up.

729
00:45:07,086 --> 00:45:09,207
They call at the last minute and they say they're not going to show up.

730
00:45:09,408 --> 00:45:16,153
And my table's been sitting there waiting for them, six people in, right, with, you know, set, and I'm waiting for this table.

731
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,255
And now it's been empty for a while, right?

732
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:20,596
What is the owner of the restaurant going to do?

733
00:45:20,797 --> 00:45:21,637
She gets creative.

734
00:45:21,937 --> 00:45:29,163
She moves around a reservation to make things fair so that one waitress isn't getting all, like, the tables while another waitress sits there.

735
00:45:29,223 --> 00:45:30,904
I know it's a silly analogy.

736
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:33,686
That's a great around.

737
00:45:33,907 --> 00:45:35,588
And she moves this reservation over here.

738
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:38,009
She gets creative to, you know why?

739
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,912
Because she wants her restaurant working, right?

740
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:42,192
She wants things to be fair.

741
00:45:42,232 --> 00:45:43,573
She wants things to be equitable.

742
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:44,254
Okay.

743
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:47,456
So they can erase the section and move something over.

744
00:45:47,696 --> 00:45:48,897
Like take those ESSA funds.

745
00:45:49,177 --> 00:45:56,402
And if you've budgeted for this and you know, you can use ESSA funds for something like this, then slide the ESSA funds into that and slide the money out of that.

746
00:45:56,943 --> 00:45:58,884
It doesn't take, get creative.

747
00:45:59,184 --> 00:45:59,565
Yeah.

748
00:46:00,986 --> 00:46:04,869
Remember, we're not asking for four or five percent more.

749
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:09,252
We're literally asking for like a half a percent more.

750
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:19,820
When you were describing the amount of money that would be shifted to the next year, it seems like a small amount to sort of argue over being able to move into that full salary.

751
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:20,775
Right.

752
00:46:20,835 --> 00:46:28,500
And so and I feel like they're when they're saying this is bad for the students, they're blaming us, you know, and it's all how you look at it.

753
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,483
So like, you know, you the people that are for us, they're going to say, come on, knock it off.

754
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:35,083
Give it to them.

755
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:36,344
This is hurting kids.

756
00:46:36,384 --> 00:46:37,165
This is hurting this.

757
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:38,145
You know, why are you doing that?

758
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:41,207
And then you have the other people that are going to say, oh, teachers, don't be ridiculous.

759
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:45,610
You know, it's a half a percent or it's it's it's a whatever it's or this isn't that.

760
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,831
Just cave and do it.

761
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:47,591
This is ridiculous.

762
00:46:47,631 --> 00:46:48,292
Have it be over.

763
00:46:48,312 --> 00:46:50,373
But we're always the ones that cave.

764
00:46:50,713 --> 00:46:53,155
We're always the ones, you know, we're the ones that are.

765
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:55,396
using our own money for supplies.

766
00:46:55,436 --> 00:47:00,698
We're the ones that are, that are, you know, parents will say, Oh my God, you answered my email at 11 o'clock at night.

767
00:47:00,938 --> 00:47:10,202
And I was like, Oh yeah, well, I looked at the email and you told me your son's crying because I gave an assignment, you know, maybe 11 o'clock, eight o'clock, like, because he's upset or she's upset.

768
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,183
And so I said, don't do it.

769
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,543
Don't do the assignment.

770
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:14,684
Like, I don't need your kid crying.

771
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:15,224
Oh my God.

772
00:47:15,644 --> 00:47:18,225
You know, you know, and they're like, well, thank you for responding this late.

773
00:47:18,245 --> 00:47:21,307
I was like, well, because we care about our kids, we do these extra things.

774
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,108
You know, so Medford, care about your kids.

775
00:47:24,628 --> 00:47:24,928
Yeah.

776
00:47:25,188 --> 00:47:25,368
Right.

777
00:47:25,848 --> 00:47:26,628
Well, yeah.

778
00:47:26,808 --> 00:47:27,108
Yeah.

779
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:36,011
It's sort of like that's pretty like simple analogy people use of like when you're on the airplane, you have to put your oxygen mask on before, you know, you're the other person.

780
00:47:36,031 --> 00:47:40,692
You have to be able to sustain yourself in this work to continue to do the good work to support our kids.

781
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:43,113
That seems like a simple solution.

782
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:44,593
And if it's about 1%.

783
00:47:44,953 --> 00:47:46,354
Right.

784
00:47:46,454 --> 00:47:48,354
That's a great way of looking at it.

785
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:49,474
Yeah.

786
00:47:49,615 --> 00:47:50,155
It's a work per se.

787
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:56,216
It's really... For a city with such a large budget, what we're asking for is really like pennies.

788
00:47:56,336 --> 00:47:56,996
It really is.

789
00:47:57,016 --> 00:47:59,457
And they're like, we're competitive and we're competitive.

790
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:00,957
And that's true.

791
00:48:01,518 --> 00:48:03,258
Oh, our salaries are competitive.

792
00:48:03,778 --> 00:48:04,758
Okay, great.

793
00:48:04,778 --> 00:48:06,419
Your salaries are competitive, but listen,

794
00:48:07,903 --> 00:48:14,504
Don't you want, you can't always say to another town and be like, well, ours is higher than this town.

795
00:48:14,764 --> 00:48:15,184
Well, great.

796
00:48:15,484 --> 00:48:20,645
Then that helps because qualified teachers are going to want to come teach for you, right?

797
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:24,806
So if you say, well, still give this amount, we're competitive.

798
00:48:25,386 --> 00:48:27,026
Ours is still better than other communities.

799
00:48:27,246 --> 00:48:30,347
Yeah, but we can also show you a lot of communities where they aren't.

800
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:33,428
And there are a lot of people that are leaving to go to other communities.

801
00:48:33,888 --> 00:48:35,808
So they're losing teachers.

802
00:48:36,215 --> 00:48:39,500
Yeah, you know, ski jumping ship teaches that have a commute.

803
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,504
Say, why would I do this when I can lessen my commute and make $10,000 more?

804
00:48:43,992 --> 00:48:52,114
And it's, you know, it's not, those of, we live in Medford, I mean, you know, it's not, it's, the taxes are expensive, it's not the hostages are expensive.

805
00:48:52,175 --> 00:48:54,055
They're not that expensive though, you know?

806
00:48:54,075 --> 00:48:58,937
I work with the teacher that lives in Medford and she's just like, my taxes aren't that high.

807
00:48:59,097 --> 00:49:02,658
I asked her how much her taxes were compared to mine, thousands less.

808
00:49:02,918 --> 00:49:04,658
And I'm not gonna get into that issue.

809
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:06,439
I think they're high.

810
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,260
I'm not saying, but Medford is not a poor community.

811
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:09,700
Yeah.

812
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,881
Okay, they're not a poor community.

813
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:13,462
Look at what houses are selling for.

814
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:15,784
Millions in the millions.

815
00:49:16,224 --> 00:49:23,610
Not to say that everyone in Medford has a lot of money, but it's not like we're one of the poor communities.

816
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:28,093
I would say Medford does pretty well.

817
00:49:28,273 --> 00:49:33,037
I mean, you have your variations, but we're not what you would consider a poor community.

818
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:39,762
Yeah, and I think, like I said before, it's how you allocate the money that you do have that sure shows those values, right?

819
00:49:40,462 --> 00:49:41,923
I don't want to take more of your time.

820
00:49:41,943 --> 00:49:45,026
I think I'm really thankful for the time you've given us today.

821
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:46,927
And thank you so much.

822
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:48,048
I wish you guys the best of luck.

823
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:51,751
I hope this comes to a satisfying resolution soon.

824
00:49:52,251 --> 00:49:54,273
Anything else that you want to mention before we wrap up?

825
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:01,266
I would like to mention that thank you to the teachers, any teacher out there, how hard they're working.

826
00:50:01,326 --> 00:50:01,727
Thank you.

827
00:50:01,747 --> 00:50:09,496
Thank you for fighting to support yourselves, fight for yourselves, show your worth, because they're the heartbeat.

828
00:50:11,298 --> 00:50:18,984
Through it all and through all the antagonism and COVID and everything, those teachers have showed up and given their all.

829
00:50:19,845 --> 00:50:21,166
And they do it for the kids.

830
00:50:21,687 --> 00:50:23,508
You know, we're not doing it for ourselves.

831
00:50:23,608 --> 00:50:24,509
They're doing it for the kids.

832
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:30,294
So I say even through all this, no matter what, no matter how anything ends, thank you for the teachers.

833
00:50:30,534 --> 00:50:34,057
And people have to know how hard they truly work because they do.

834
00:50:35,037 --> 00:50:38,520
And I can echo the sentiments and, you know, I can see it.

835
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,582
And they're amazing.

836
00:50:41,682 --> 00:50:42,562
They work so hard.

837
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:48,567
They're there, you know, like Joanne says, late hours, answering emails, you know, all of those things.

838
00:50:48,847 --> 00:50:50,848
And I can't thank them enough.

839
00:50:50,868 --> 00:50:51,589
They're out there.

840
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:53,010
They want people to know.

841
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,791
how they're worth.

842
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,791
And I think that's the best way of putting it.

843
00:50:56,831 --> 00:51:04,775
They want people to know that they're worth and they want people to know that they truly do want a fair and equitable deal.

844
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:11,558
And it's really when you are happy at a job and you feel good,

845
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:14,648
You perform better.

846
00:51:15,248 --> 00:51:18,630
When you're not happy or you fail to moralize, you don't do as well.

847
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,430
That is so important.

848
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:28,774
If you don't have, and if people are feeling that deflated or, you know, and things like that, that's what it is.

849
00:51:28,894 --> 00:51:31,455
And you can say it as much as you want.

850
00:51:32,095 --> 00:51:38,778
You know, we appreciate you, but please remember, if you're going to say you appreciate me, then

851
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:44,412
Don't come out and say that, oh, well, we got to spend money, those asset funds.

852
00:51:44,472 --> 00:51:48,993
So if you don't do this, then we're not going to let it take that money away.

853
00:51:49,013 --> 00:51:50,314
Okay.

854
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:53,315
Don't do things like that because that's demoralizing.

855
00:51:53,875 --> 00:51:56,196
And it's really important not to do that.

856
00:51:56,556 --> 00:51:59,037
And it's important to show that.

857
00:51:59,937 --> 00:52:04,079
you know, I do respect you 110% and I'm going to get this.

858
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:05,840
And I'm appreciative.

859
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,922
I'm really, truly appreciative of the teachers and what they do.

860
00:52:09,663 --> 00:52:11,484
And I want to thank them.

861
00:52:11,724 --> 00:52:16,186
They have been very supportive of me and, you know, of this negotiation.

862
00:52:16,206 --> 00:52:16,967
And I want to thank the team.

863
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:22,751
This negotiations team, I mean, just to give you an example, I mean, we're ready at a minute's notice.

864
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:26,353
I mean, we literally, Wednesday, worked four hours.

865
00:52:26,713 --> 00:52:30,956
You know, we went in there at 3.30 and we didn't even have dinner, all of us.

866
00:52:30,976 --> 00:52:33,618
8 o'clock, we were in a room, no internet, nothing.

867
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:34,278
It was long.

868
00:52:34,638 --> 00:52:39,982
And then they called us up the next day, asked us to meet, gave us an offer that we made a counter.

869
00:52:40,562 --> 00:52:43,463
And they refused our contract, a very reasonable contract.

870
00:52:43,984 --> 00:52:50,026
And you know that, but this team, and then again, yesterday, we're on again.

871
00:52:50,386 --> 00:52:51,727
Last night, we're on again.

872
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:54,348
And I'm sure we'll be on again this weekend.

873
00:52:54,628 --> 00:52:55,388
I guarantee you.

874
00:52:55,549 --> 00:53:00,291
But I think that, you know, thank you to the teachers and let's get this done.

875
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:01,331
We're close.

876
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:02,672
Let's get this done.

877
00:53:03,072 --> 00:53:10,215
And let's make sure, you know, we show the value in the city that we value the kids and the educators.

878
00:53:10,675 --> 00:53:14,040
And doing that is the only way is getting a fear in it, won't you?

879
00:53:15,002 --> 00:53:18,106
Well, thank you so much, and I hope it is a speedy, speedy conclusion.

880
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:20,129
I hope so, too.

881
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,291
I hope so, too.

882
00:53:29,595 --> 00:53:31,557
