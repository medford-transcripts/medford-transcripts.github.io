    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=29.232">Join</a>  us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=32.694">And</a>  as always, tell us where you like to eat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=44.098">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=44.418">Thank</a>  you both so much for joining me today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=46.439">I'm</a>  wondering if you could introduce yourself just with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=50.5">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=52.661">So</a>  my name is Sharlene Douglas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=54.702">My</a>  pronouns are she and her, and I am the president of the Method Teacher Association. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=61.024">I</a>  have been, I taught for 30 years as a co-school educator, and I am finishing out my term as president as a retired teacher, and I'm finishing it out, so it'll be done in June. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=73.208">And</a>  so as far as education, you know, I've been in education and I still presently teach at Lesley University as a professor and I'm going into my 20th year at Lesley University.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=85.758">I'm</a>  Joanne McKay. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=87.038">I</a>  am the financial, oh, I'm sorry, she, her. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=91.099">And</a>  I'm the financial secretary for the Medford Teachers Association. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=95.8">I</a>  teach fourth grade presently, mainly third or fourth grade is always what I've taught. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=100.161">I've</a>  taught a few other grades. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=101.881">And</a>  I've been teaching in Medford for about 30 years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=106.242">Been</a>  with the union, probably a part of the union for the past 20. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=111.923">So</a>  that's, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=114.075">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=114.435">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=114.695">And</a>  so we'll just start with our normal question that I ask everyone on the podcast, and then we're going to get into, I think, some content that people are excited to hear about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=122.798">But</a>  if you could both say what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=130.358">So</a>  my favorite place to eat is the Real Gusto and you know, some of their Italian cuisine there is very, very good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=137.102">They</a>  have obviously amazing pizza and actually I had my retirement party there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=141.364">So</a>  I like the whole atmosphere. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=143.405">I</a>  like the, you know, overlooking the river and it's a great, a great little place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=148.067">And</a>  so I enjoy eating there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=150.41">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=151.091">So</a>  my favorite place to eat, I can't eat at because it's small, but to get takeout, does that count?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=156.756">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=157.196">Ronnie's</a>  Place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=158.457">So</a>  we love to get Ronnie's Place takeout at the school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=162.02">He's</a>  right down the street from where we're at, the Roberts Elementary. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=164.803">And</a>  actually I taught his oldest son, Giancarlo, was in my class. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=169.127">I</a>  had a loop year, so I had him for two years and I presently have his daughter, Mia, in my class. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=175.212">I</a>  know it's around this place, but that's not why I was trying to get out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=177.934">I</a>  actually the food and my favorite thing to eat there is my God, I don't even know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=182.557">They</a>  have so many. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=183.457">I</a>  love them because they're not your traditional takeout. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=186.619">They</a>  have so many like different variations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=190.142">So,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=190.802">They're</a>  a favorite in our house too for pizza. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=193.263">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=194.303">Yeah,</a>  they are right there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=195.824">That's</a>  really close to where my sister lives and I go there quite often too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=199.826">I</a>  really do enjoy it too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=201.386">It's</a>  a great place.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=202.727">Well,</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=204.067">So</a>  I think we have kind of a lot to maybe cover today, but I'm hoping to talk about the negotiations that are currently going. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=210.75">So</a>  you guys are so generous to give me time early on a Saturday morning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=214.531">I</a>  think it sounds like you're deep in some of the negotiations, but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=218.513">I'm</a>  wondering if you could just sort of outline, like give us a picture of kind of how we got here, how this maybe is different than normal negotiations go, any sort of light that you could shed on for people that might not like fully understand the process or what's going on right now would be really helpful.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=236.736">So</a>  myself and Joanne, we negotiated, I mean, I don't even know how many contracts together, maybe I've done at least <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=247.077">I</a>  mean, 2007, I don't know, maybe eight, nine loads of contracts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=251.44">I</a>  mean, I couldn't tell you the number, obviously, of contracts that I've been involved in and negotiating. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=256.043">What,</a>  and, you know, we've been able to, you know, always, we've been able to come to an agreement where it doesn't get to, you know, well over a year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=264.849">This</a>  has been, and so it's that, in that respect, it's different. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=268.232">And,</a>  you know, we've always, one of the things that, you know, we, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=271.654">You</a>  know, we worked through, we would stay late. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=273.856">You</a>  know, these negotiations have been pretty scripted, I think, you know, that we're meeting like for two hours and then, you know, we go away. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=280.102">And</a>  I think that, that kind of did impact and sometimes, you know, we didn't spend, I don't think we spent good quality time there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=287.188">Not</a>  quality, that's not the right word. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=288.91">I</a>  don't think that sometimes it was, you know, it was a time limit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=292.953">And</a>  I'm not sure if that was the best approach to negotiations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=296.776">I</a>  think sometimes when you're negotiating, you need to really just, you know, work through and get things done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=303.381">And</a>  I think the time limit had an impact. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=305.963">And</a>  I think there was a... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=309.185">There</a>  was some, there was some negativity within the group. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=311.947">And</a>  I think some of that negativity stemmed from the fact that the unions here in Medford, they sort of a coalition and, you know, we wanted all the same things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=320.473">And</a>  I think that was a big play that, you know, we, we came together 20 something unions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=325.717">We</a>  have a group that negotiates health insurance called the PEC group. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=329.219">So</a>  we sort of came together and we said, you know, we're going to try to take a stance that all <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=333.842">City</a>  employees, school employees were treated fairly and equally. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=337.625">And</a>  I don't think that was taken well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=339.266">So</a>  I think that might've also impacted some of the things that have gone on within these whole negotiations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=344.85">But</a>  it's, it's, it's been tough. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=346.811">There</a>  have been some, a lot of, there's been some negativity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=349.954">There's</a>  been some misrepresentations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=352.275">Joanne,</a>  do you want to add before I go into the no confidence, the whole idea?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=356.218">I</a>  think that other contributing factors was COVID. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=359.499">I</a>  mean, COVID affects everything, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=363.1">So,</a>  you know, we have to meet by Zoom. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=365.54">Zoom</a>  isn't always the best, you know, obviously. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=368.461">We</a>  all have experienced that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=370.161">And</a>  there's nothing like face-to-face, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=372.442">So</a>  I think you accomplish a lot more in face-to-face and it's definitely more difficult on Zoom. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=378.763">And</a>  as Charlene said, the time limit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=381.284">So</a>  in the past when we would negotiate, we would set our dates and we would <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=386.545">There</a>  was no time limit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=388.066">So</a>  we'd show up, you know, December 3rd at three o'clock and we would go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=392.887">And</a>  sometimes it would be really productive and it would be a four hour session. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=396.868">And</a>  then sometimes, you know, we would be an hour in and we'd be frustrated with each other and we'd just decide like, you know what, we have to call it today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=404.71">Like</a>  we're not getting anywhere today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=406.611">We're</a>  going to reconvene. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=407.771">So</a>  what was difficult for us is ours. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=410.372">This</a>  was a hard, hard stop. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=413.433">You</a>  know, so there were times that you would be kind of on a roll, you know, and then all of a sudden you get like you have to we have 10 minutes, you know, and then it would have to stop, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=423.883">And</a>  so for us, was that a you know, a strategy on their point part where they put it off was this reality of, you know, in their defense, they were. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=434.133">busier</a>  than they've ever been before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=435.694">You</a>  know, I mean, it's not it's not all against them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=438.217">You</a>  know, they had so much going on with Covid too, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=441.399">So</a>  it's really I think Covid affected it a lot, you know, you know, on both sides, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=448.465">And</a>  I also think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=450.507">that</a>  because even amongst our own team, you sort of fight more on COVID and it's not intentionally. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=455.83">I</a>  don't even more fight because you all over speak each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=459.892">You</a>  know, it's hard not to over speak each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=461.533">When</a>  you're in a room together and you're speaking, you know, body language is different and it gets loud on the computer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=467.736">So</a>  you're trying to make your point and you almost over talk someone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=470.818">Sometimes</a>  there's lagging, you know, so then I even think that those computer issues, I mean, Charlene, would you agree sort of add to that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=477.502">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=478.322">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=480.363">I,</a>  I've often said to Shailene before, like, I'd love to meet these people, like, just for a drink and see how different things would be, you know, because it gets heightened, you know, and I think, you know, that, that, so that, so that's another part of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=492.531">And</a>  then I also think that what was different this time is typically we've always, we've always negotiated with the superintendent, the lawyer, and one or two other people that, that speak out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=503.739">And</a>  that wasn't the case. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=504.64">We</a>  don't, we don't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=506.441">We</a>  don't negotiate with the superintendent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=508.344">It</a>  is the assistant superintendent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=510.587">And</a>  the lawyer, what was different this year is the lawyer barely speaks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=514.893">And</a>  he always in the past had a lot to say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=518.278">And</a>  predominantly we only hear from one person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=522.477">And</a>  no one else really says anything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=523.898">They</a>  interject in between. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=525.74">Oftentimes</a>  the superintendent doesn't speak at all. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=528.643">And</a>  there were many times the camera wasn't even on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=532.687">If</a>  she was there, I don't even know if she was there every time.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=536.17">Yeah,</a>  she should be there and her camera was off. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=539.993">it</a>  seemed that the assistant superintendent, David Murphy, was really the spokesperson, you know, who did all the speaking for the team. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=547.441">And</a>  that was a change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=548.362">I</a>  mean, you know, we always worked with the attorney, the attorney always spoke, and he was silent, absolutely silent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=556.209">And</a>  so that was a big change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=558.371">And</a>  I think that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=559.933">You</a>  know, he knows the history of Medved because he's been around for a long, long time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=564.874">And</a>  I do think that that sense of him not being an active participant, I think that impacted it also.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=571.756">I</a>  mean, it's not to say that it, you know, it's bad change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=575.297">You</a>  know, it's a different leadership. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=577.238">But</a>  I say, like, I think for us, that was different. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=580.079">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=580.519">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=580.839">You</a>  know, and that was a hard, a hard change to get used to.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=583.74">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=583.94">So</a>  different people involved in sort of the negotiations this time around, is that</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=589.221">Different</a>  people involved, obviously, because different people, but just a different dynamic, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=594.063">I</a>  mean, we weren't used to a silent superintendent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=597.924">You</a>  know, in the past, you know, Roy Belson, he was, you know, he was the head of it and he handled it, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=605.587">And</a>  so this was different because, you know, for us, we're used to dealing, you know, you, you, you, you know, I tell the kids in my class, like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=613.189">I'm</a>  in charge of you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=614.39">My</a>  principal is in charge of an assistant principal in charge of me, like directors in charge of them, in charge of them, you know, and it's like, you know, I relate it into government, you know, who's in charge of who. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=625.476">So,</a>  you know, we had always we've always had the whole like superintendents in charge, you know, I mean, that's been the way it's been forever, like a chain of command or chain of command. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=634.782">So</a>  this was a hard flip because it would be like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=640.437">Why</a>  is she not saying anything? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=641.758">Why</a>  is nothing being said? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=643.12">You</a>  know, why is the camera not on? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=645.262">You</a>  know, until we finally we got used to that after a while. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=648.245">But</a>  in the beginning, that was a big change and hard to get used to because it's like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=652.21">You</a>  know, an authority thing like who has I don't know, it was weird.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=656.674">Yeah,</a>  it was weird. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=658.436">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=659.718">And</a>  so I think that was, you know, a huge piece of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=662.38">And</a>  then, you know, there was the, you know, when we weren't making inroads and we took some actions like, you know, walk-ins and things like that, you know, that was, which is all right to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=673.952">And</a>  it was almost like that became, like, we were the bad guys, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=679.678">Would</a>  you say that, Joanne? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=680.759">It</a>  was sort of, I don't know if that's the right term.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=683.121">It</a>  has just never been us against them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=688.085">You</a>  know, you have some type of us against them when you're, you know, union administration. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=693.81">But</a>  I've always felt that up until recently, we really, really worked well together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=699.715">So,</a>  and Charlene will remember when COVID first came out, first came, what you call it, but when it first appeared around, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=708.442">You</a>  know, we are hearing about it in the news and then we're hearing, oh, this is getting really bad. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=713.605">And</a>  then next thing you know, one day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=716.346">Zero</a>  hour, we're called up to the high school, you know, you have to come up to high school and they take a couple of elementary people, whatever, they cover our classes, we go up there, we're like, oh, what's going on, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=727.492">And</a>  they sit us in the room and they're like, OK, like we're closing school down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=731.173">You</a>  can't even imagine how crazy that was. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=733.134">We're</a>  like, what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=734.375">So</a>  yeah, we got to close school down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=736.157">How</a>  are we going to do this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=736.898">Like,</a>  how are we going to teach the kids? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=738.499">So</a>  the union was like, listen, school's down for the kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=741.902">The</a>  teachers will come. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=743.364">And</a>  they were like, what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=744.185">And</a>  we're like, the teachers will come. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=746.307">We'll</a>  all come in tomorrow. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=747.568">Like,</a>  it's not bad yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=749.049">If</a>  people need to wear masks, it's a scary thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=751.071">We</a>  need to calm down the teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=752.533">We'll</a>  figure this out, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=753.634">And</a>  we worked so well together and they were like, oh my God, thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=757.277">And</a>  we went around and we, like myself and another teacher, Ellie O'Leary, like we took the elementary, someone else took something and we talked to the teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=765.265">We</a>  met with Diane Caldwell. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=767.987">She</a>  was in charge of elementary at the time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=769.969">In</a>  the morning, early in the morning, like, oh, what can we tell these teachers to do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=773.092">And</a>  then we went building to building and told them like, this is what they're asking you to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=776.295">And</a>  the teachers were great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=777.176">They</a>  jump into action. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=778.036">Of</a>  course, no one knew what was going on, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=780.566">So</a>  off we go and it was great, you know, we're working together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=785.107">And</a>  then next thing you know, we hear like, we're going to be closed down for a bit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=789.209">And</a>  this was before our power Zoom sessions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=791.829">We</a>  never had this before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=792.81">And</a>  I know this sounds crazy to say we had this five-hour Zoom because now that's commonplace. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=798.031">But</a>  I sat at my dining room table and we sat there, myself, Charlene, Diane Caldwell, Bernadette Riccidelli, I think Paulo de Levers, I don't know who else at the time, other union members, and we hashed out straight for five and a half hours, you know, what can we do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=816.142">Like,</a>  how can we work this out with our contract? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=823.582">We're</a>  going to need a set of parameters because we want to be as fair as it can be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=827.486">We</a>  know, and we did it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=829.248">You</a>  know, it was like this crazy thing we'd never done before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=831.891">We</a>  worked so well together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=833.052">There</a>  wasn't yelling, there wasn't fighting, there wasn't screaming. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=835.995">We</a>  did it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=836.316">We</a>  implemented it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=837.317">And</a>  then we had to come back together again when things changed, when they said we're staying out even longer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=842.782">And</a>  we did it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=844.444">And</a>  then Covid continued. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=845.925">And</a>  then we had the summer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=847.326">And</a>  then how are we reopening schools? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=849.247">And</a>  that was very contentious, if you remember. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=852.029">That</a>  was more contentious of how we did it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=855.651">And</a>  you argued a little. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=856.932">It</a>  was fine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=858.053">And</a>  then I don't like we all worked well together.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=861.315">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=862.036">And</a>  I don't know, with this contract, it it changed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=867.466">And</a>  I don't, I can never pinpoint why. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=870.248">Is</a>  it the leadership? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=871.59">Is</a>  the change of our side stayed the same?</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=873.872">Yeah,</a>  we did stay the same. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=875.493">And</a>  it was, it was, you know, it's interesting, you know, because when we went in that day and the first time when they say they were closed in the schools and, you know, you know, we insisted that our teachers have time to go back into those schools, get the materials they needed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=888.344">They</a>  went in that day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=890.126">They</a>  went in and it was very, very important, you know, for them because we knew <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=896.238">what</a>  we didn't know how long, we thought we're gonna be closed for two weeks at the most. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=899.54">You</a>  know, we never anticipated being closed as long as we were. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=902.962">And,</a>  you know, when we met and literally we would, I think it was a Saturday, we met on all of us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=908.885">And</a>  I think it was longer than five hours. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=910.706">I</a>  thought it was more like six, like seven hours. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=914.128">We</a>  just worked it out with the minister, you know, with some of the administration.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=918.431">For</a>  some reason with administration, it's, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=922.933">There's</a>  a lot of arguing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=924.074">We</a>  know we don't.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=925.574">So</a>  I don't know why. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=927.335">So</a>  what I'm hearing is like typically the negotiations are with like a smaller team of people than is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=932.698">And</a>  right now it sounds like school committees involved, which includes the mayor, like you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=938.32">Or</a>  they're not involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=939.921">OK,</a>  that this is a question that I've had, like I said, because I hear a lot about like, how can we pressure our school committee members? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=945.663">What</a>  like what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=946.983">So,</a>  yeah, where are we now? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=948.384">I</a>  heard I also heard things about like going to DSEE. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=950.785">And</a>  so I guess anything that you can do to kind of like demystify what's happening.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=956.947">Yeah,</a>  if I could start. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=959.288">So</a>  basically the negotiations teams, everyone gets to choose who is on representative of their teams. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=964.991">Our</a>  contract is between the school committee and the mayor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=969.973">Obviously</a>  the mayor was the chair of the school committee, have the final, they vote, okay? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=974.555">And</a>  they can put their representatives in charge. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=977.116">What</a>  we had asked for is that we knew we weren't making inroads. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=980.518">So</a>  we did ask for the school committee and the mayor to be part of this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=985.06">Um,</a>  they did reach out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=987.301">I</a>  think it was in June. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=988.661">I'd</a>  have to pull my letter and I could give you the exact date in a minute. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=991.622">But</a>  in June, you know, the, when we were really on a struggle, the mayor did reach out to me and ask for a meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=998.463">And</a>  I thought that meeting, because from my emails, my understanding of the meeting was, was going to be by myself and the, and I didn't know who else was even going to be there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1006.865">As</a>  a matter of fact, my co-respondent, Mr. Murphy, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1009.506">I</a>  even asked him, will you be there? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1011.506">He</a>  goes, I don't believe so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1012.967">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1013.827">So,</a>  and myself and our MTA rep, great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1017.048">So</a>  at that meeting, you know, all of a sudden we were, there was everyone in their team and that's when Ms. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1023.269">Graham,</a>  member of the committee showed up and it was just myself and Greg. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1027.19">So</a>  we were, I was like, well, my whole team isn't here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1030.031">And</a>  they did, I think they did, they did a proposal at that meeting for us, but it wasn't my whole team. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1035.452">So</a>  we, I don't feel that we negotiated because my whole team. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1039.775">That</a>  was an off-the-record meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1044.305">So</a>  that is the only true meeting that they have been at. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1049.929">So</a>  we've been asking for them to attend, to hear, and to make sure that we wanted them to hear our voices. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1057.976">And</a>  we didn't, that hasn't happened. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1060.057">And</a>  I think, Joanne, if you wanna highlight anything I'm missing, but that's the, there's the frustration on our part. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1067.183">You</a>  have on Monday, the school committee saying that they've been there at multiple meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1071.746">You</a>  know, the school committee, I literally went back, myself and LEA, one of the members, and I said, did I mess up? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1078.67">Because</a>  you begin to question yourself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1080.351">I</a>  said, did I mess up? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1081.532">Were</a>  they there? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1082.452">And</a>  we went through our attendance records and, you know, because we have to keep, I mean, part of the bargaining rules is we have to keep accurate notes in bargaining history, because that all plays into the contract, even after it's when it's ratified. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1095.66">So</a>  we did go back, we did check, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1099.402">That's</a>  the best of my knowledge. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1100.963">Now,</a>  they were at when we were negotiating for COVID, the COVID MOA, it was very different than the actual bargain. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1110.006">OK,</a>  so we were still negotiating a COVID, a final COVID MOA and at the beginning of last school year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1118.09">OK.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1118.9">Correct,</a>  Joanne?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1119.921">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1120.221">We're</a>  analyzing it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1121.423">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1121.703">And</a>  also, so the other thing is, is that a lot of people don't understand with negotiation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1128.169">When</a>  you negotiate, you come with a whole list of things, and you know there are things you aren't going to get, and they know things they aren't going to get, and you hash them out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1138.742">But</a>  what you have is something occasionally called an off the record. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1142.884">You</a>  know, so you do and really, you know, you feel like you've made some progress and, you know, the mayor is obviously the head of the city and she's the ones that holds the financial purse strings, so to say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1156.812">So</a>  oftentimes you might have an off the record where they feel like, hey, at this point, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1162.615">everything</a>  else is pretty good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1164.036">Let's</a>  just pull to the side and just be like, look, can we get this done? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1167.838">You</a>  know, if we offered you and you kind of the purpose of an off the record is sort of, I don't know, Shailene, would you kind of just show your hands on what your bottom line is? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1176.583">You</a>  know, like instead of like having six sessions where we go, you know, five, five, five, one, one, one, five, three points, like, you know what I mean? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1185.388">Like</a>  you finally just like, oh, what's bottom line here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1187.509">You</a>  know, like, can we cut to the chase? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1188.93">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1189.43">So</a>  that was off the record.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1191.351">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1191.831">That</a>  is not, that was not an official, you know, recorded where we take notes, where we, you know, so to say they came to negotiations, like, no, you didn't.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1201.975">Hmm.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1202.395">You</a>  called a meeting, I reckon meeting and, and you had one representative with you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1207.437">You</a>  didn't come. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1208.517">And</a>  we, we have publicly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1210.918">call</a>  them out, ask them to come many times, you know, and to say like, this is not going, like, we need you there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1218.261">And</a>  they don't come. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1219.322">So</a>  the newest, you know, obviously at the last school committee meeting, one of the members made a motion, Paolo Russo made a motion that someone from the school committee be there, you know, and that passed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1234.443">So</a>  the mayor was there and it's funny because we knew, I mean, I, in my head knew no one else was coming with the mayor, but I don't feel like she was the representative because. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1247.265">They</a>  had already called the meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1248.405">I</a>  don't know, how can you explain that, Charlene?</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1249.986">Charlene</a>  and her- So basically, basically what I had done is, you know, I had written to the mayor saying that, you know, that what they had proposed, I had done a poll and it's not going to pass. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1262.269">So</a>  we can't, and we already, so I think we need to back and, you know, back up a little bit here for people to understand. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1268.99">So</a>  from the school committee and this whole, well, maybe not. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1273.031">So</a>  it had not, the ratification vote didn't pass. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1277.612">We</a>  have to now go back. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1279.233">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1279.873">So</a>  we went back and we asked to renegotiate and there was some nastiness back and forth with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1285.614">And</a>  then, you know, I reached out to her and I did, you know, say in my letter, please show, you know, and, and, and we had presented a proposal and we were looking for a counter and the counter was nothing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1297.237">So,</a>  but we really wanted something.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1299.358">Can</a>  you say what the like elements were that weren't, that like didn't pass or like what the things you wanted to change in the counter offer?</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1307.928">So</a>  we had two, okay, so let me, I think it's important people understand that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1315.183">By</a>  law, okay, there's laws that we have to obey when we negotiate contracts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1321.147">By</a>  law, we, and even in our grounds and in the law, there is rules that all contracts that negotiated by the negotiations team are brought back to the members. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1333.175">That's</a>  called a tentative agreement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1334.916">And</a>  the word tentative means it's tentative. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1336.538">We</a>  don't have an agreement yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1337.938">Hopefully</a>  it will pass. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1339.68">And</a>  usually it does by 90%. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1342.22">When</a>  we went to our members to present it, and we did, and we supported it, and big MTA supported it, came out, even one of the bigger people from MTA supported that and said that it's very important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1352.791">We</a>  think it's a fair and honest deal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1354.733">Our</a>  members didn't think so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1356.115">There</a>  were issues that they didn't like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1358.337">Um,</a>  there was an issue about the implementation of changing the Wednesdays and what that would look like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1363.518">And</a>  they didn't, there wasn't, the language wasn't strong enough on that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1366.939">And</a>  so they really felt that they didn't, and there was a trust that it was a sense of trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1371.919">They</a>  didn't trust the district to implement it properly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1374.48">And</a>  so that was one of the big things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1376.26">And</a>  the other thing was compensation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1377.84">There</a>  were two major issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1379.501">So</a>  they told us loud and clear, it didn't pass. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1382.881">We</a>  notified them immediately that it didn't pass and. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1387.242">That</a>  meant that that tender agreement now no longer exists. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1392.046">Even</a>  though I initialed it, which is what I have to do, and so did the superintendent, that TA is no longer, if it's not ratified, it doesn't exist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1400.872">The</a>  fact that what they're doing is actually almost illegal, it is illegal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1406.696">stating</a>  that we still have a tentative agreement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1411.019">You</a>  know, we don't have a tentative agreement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1413.301">Even</a>  the mediator has stated that we don't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1415.543">And</a>  that's why we did when we did our action letter, we asked the mayor, you know, responded and said, we have a tentative agreement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1423.128">You</a>  know, people were like questioning that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1424.549">And</a>  I asked her to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1425.79">cease</a>  and desist and to, you know, withdraw that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1428.653">She</a>  didn't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1429.454">So</a>  we did file a charge with the Department of Labor Relations, you know, that that's bad faith bargaining and that's not, and that's against the law. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1438.523">Ratification</a>  laws are there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1440.485">And</a>  if you, if you look even just recently, I think Melrose reached a tentative agreement and it says, a tentative agreement to be ratified by both <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1449.014">the</a>  school committee and the membership. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1452.476">So</a>  until it's ratified, it doesn't go into effect. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1455.537">And</a>  if it doesn't, you're back at the table.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1457.758">And</a>  I also think that, I think the tough thing was is, you know, what the community needs to know is that, you know, we're the representatives of our teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1469.163">You</a>  know, we can't say what they're going to say yes or no to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1473.505">We</a>  do talk to them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1474.966">We</a>  think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1476.206">And,</a>  you know, so on their side, they said, well, you said that this was a strong offer and this was this was good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1482.948">This</a>  was good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1483.548">And</a>  we said we did. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1485.129">We</a>  did say that because we heard how much you were going to give us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1489.13">You</a>  gave a little bit more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1490.531">You</a>  did something a little differently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1492.091">And</a>  we thought based on what they say they're going to give us, like this is the best they're going to give us.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1497.213">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1497.633">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1497.953">Like</a>  this is good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1498.913">People</a>  should accept this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1500.194">We're</a>  going to vote again and we're going to renegotiate another year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1503.035">Blah,</a>  blah, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1504.335">You</a>  know, and we're going to bring it back. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1506.577">And</a>  then for the elementary. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1507.878">And</a>  again, I'm I'm actually not blaming Medford on this because it happened really quick at the end. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1515.083">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1515.463">And</a>  the the elementary language we had tied into the money, like, you're not getting the Wednesdays unless we can do something with the compensation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1523.569">And</a>  then. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1524.73">When</a>  it all came down in the end, you can imagine it comes pretty quick, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1528.192">Because</a>  now it's like, let's get this done, let's get this done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1531.153">And</a>  through no fault of them, through no fault of us, even maybe, maybe it is through fault of us that we didn't put stronger language, but... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1539.797">Prior</a>  in the contract, when we tried to put something in the language, we were told, you don't put language like that in the contract, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1546.181">Because</a>  we had talked about a class size for something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1548.983">You</a>  don't put language like that in a contract. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1550.785">We</a>  do that because that's in the best interest of the children. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1554.187">That's</a>  not something, if you put things like that in the contract all the time, the contract would be, you know, huge. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1559.551">So</a>  that's something we work out because that's in the best interest of the children. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1564.394">And</a>  so, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1565.939">It</a>  all did happen quick and we didn't put parameters on the Wednesdays. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1569.683">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1571.225">When</a>  it all rolled out, elementary was like, what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1576.09">You</a>  know, not that they don't want to give up that Wednesday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1579.713">It</a>  is for, you know, we agree better for the children to be there longer, but there were no guidelines around it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1585.9">And</a>  unfortunately there's a trust issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1588.302">So</a>  now people are like, you know, I'm not going to trust what's going to happen when when the kids don't have their specialists, because we're getting out at 12 now once a month. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1597.084">And</a>  how is my prep time going to be made up? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1599.124">And</a>  I don't even get prep time now, like just all these issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1601.525">And</a>  what are they going to do about lunch? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1602.785">And</a>  what are they going to do about bus duty? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1604.325">And</a>  what are they going to do about this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1605.946">And</a>  all of a sudden, things a lot of people didn't think of our side, didn't think of their side, didn't think of in the whole thing, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1612.507">And</a>  I've said to Charlene before, we can take blame, a little blame that, too, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1617.768">And.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1619.207">the</a>  administration did respond well to that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1621.808">You</a>  would agree, Charlene? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1622.869">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1623.589">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1624.33">Like,</a>  all right, fix this, we'll put some parameters in, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1628.212">So</a>  then we went back with them that basically we had two issues, the elementary issue and the compensation issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1634.695">And</a>  they did, they worked very well with the elementary issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1637.657">And</a>  I think they too <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1640.218">said,</a>  wow, OK, yeah, we didn't think of that, you know, and we put together schedules and said, like, look, how would you move? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1646.96">Because</a>  we have these things called wind blocks where kids get extra help and we're on a block scheduling. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1651.701">And</a>  we're like, if we lose a specialist and lose the prep, like here's the only time you could take to make it up for us, you know, like because our schedules are crazy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1659.164">Kids</a>  are pulled up, you know, and I think administration was like, oh, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1663.825">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1664.445">You</a>  know, okay, we need to make some changes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1666.726">They</a>  were very open to that, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1668.967">And</a>  they did, and they worked with us with that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1670.607">It</a>  was excellent, actually.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1672.388">It</a>  was excellent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1673.548">And</a>  it was very productive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1675.309">There</a>  was no arguing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1676.409">It</a>  was great, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1677.75">And</a>  then our other thing was, and the compensation, they don't like the compensation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1682.071">And</a>  at that point, it's where things got bad. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1683.792">They</a>  were like, you even said this was a strong offer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1686.393">We're</a>  like, okay, we did because it was the strongest offer you were giving us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1689.594">So</a>  we did. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1690.154">We</a>  went back to our members and we said, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1692.795">This</a>  is the strongest offer, like, we think it's a good deal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1695.557">You</a>  should take it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1696.598">But</a>  the member said, no, no, it's not what's going on in other communities, not what we're teaching is like now, not as what we're dealing with after the pandemic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1705.986">You</a>  know, it's not it's not enough to show value. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1709.749">And</a>  this is where our problem is, because I think they don't believe <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1714.965">that</a>  we brought back that offer in good faith, that first call. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1719.146">That's</a>  what's being insinuated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1721.427">And</a>  that we didn't do our job to get it ratified. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1724.347">And</a>  that's disheartening because we did. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1727.848">And</a>  we have members that said, geez, after that Zoom call, I feel like they were pressuring us to vote yes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1733.97">People</a>  said to me, they were telling us all these terrible things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1737.751">If</a>  you don't say yes, and it's almost like they were bullying us to say yes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1740.473">I</a>  said, well, they weren't bullying you to say yes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1742.755">We</a>  brought back a thing that we want ratified, and they need to let you know everything that can happen if you don't say yes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1749.74">And</a>  then for them, for administration to say we didn't do our job, it's like, the members spoke.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1758.127">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1758.768">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1759.848">And</a>  that's part of the process.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1760.849">That's</a>  the democratic process.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1762.51">So</a>  that negotiating that you're describing around changing with the Wednesdays, has that happened since the, that happened like very recently?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1771.216">That</a>  happened after we didn't ratify the contract. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1774.839">We</a>  got back together and they were willing to work with that, but they were only willing to work on the elementary.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1780.318">And</a>  it was always no to money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1782.459">It</a>  was never even discussed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1784.661">I</a>  mean, you know, on October 25th, my discussion, you know, I'd said the two issues and it was, no, you understand, we're not gonna talk money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1791.386">And</a>  I said, I understand that, but it's still an issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1792.987">You</a>  understand, we're not, I said, I get what you're saying, but it's going to be an issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1797.01">And,</a>  you know, and even, you know, when we met that day, that Wednesday face-to-face, you know, I said, do you know that we're not gonna talk money? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1802.854">And</a>  I said, yes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1803.654">And</a>  I told my members that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1805.115">And</a>  I said, and I told them that, but I'm gonna let, at that point, I let, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1808.898">Some</a>  of the other members on the team really addressed the same voice because my voice they weren't hearing, I didn't think, so I felt that it needed a couple of other members on that team. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1817.48">So</a>  they didn't hear that.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1818.68">I</a>  can't imagine what it's like to negotiate salary in such a public way and like, and that feeling so linked to like your value and your job and your value in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1828.542">I</a>  wonder like, what, like, what do you, like, what do you think the solution is to the, to the money issue?</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1838.21">So</a>  I don't think, you know, we're not, you know, I think, first of all, I think we're in very different times too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1845.692">I</a>  mean, you're looking around and, you know, teachers, the profession is definitely, it's changed, you know, in all the years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1852.834">So</a>  I think that, you know, we've, we've. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1856.175">We've</a>  made reasonable offers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1857.595">I</a>  mean, we just want something that's fair and equitable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1861.876">And</a>  it's very, very important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1863.857">And,</a>  you know, other communities, you know, we posted the raises they're getting, you know, and ours isn't close to that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1870.579">And</a>  I think, you know, one of the things that was the members were very, very concerned about in that year was when we negotiated our package, it was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1879.581">You</a>  know, it was an eight, it was stated, it was an 8.5, but the last 1% wouldn't take effect until the year after our, you wouldn't see it actually until the year after our contract. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1893.847">Right,</a>  you wouldn't get it on the last day, but you really wouldn't see that until when you came back in your first paycheck. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1900.25">Okay,</a>  so what happens there is that the membership saw it as, you know, not an 8.0, they were concerned. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1906.953">And</a>  they were very concerned about that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1908.974">And</a>  I think their concerns were heard when, you know, it was presented at Monday's school committee that that 8.5 is really a 7.6. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1915.737">So</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1917.738">And</a>  so the other thing, too, is like our members. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1920.479">So</a>  our members tell us, like, we're not going to take less than a certain. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1924.721">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1925.221">And</a>  and so we go in there knowing that they're not going to take less. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1931.244">Well,</a>  they say they're not going to take less than a certain amount. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1933.505">They're</a>  looking for a certain amount. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1934.746">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1935.98">And</a>  so what we brought back was less than the CERN. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1939.121">And</a>  sometimes that happens, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1940.922">Okay,</a>  because we don't hold the purse strings, but it was close, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1945.284">But</a>  not really, because 8.5 was close to what we want, but not really because they're giving it on the last day, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1953.108">So</a>  now it's not really what we want, plus we don't see it that whole year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1957.61">So</a>  what we mean on the last day is on the last day of school, you have a salary scale. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1962.912">So</a>  on the last day of school, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1965.053">your</a>  salary for the next year will go up one percent, which means you got none of that money in your pocket. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1970.315">OK,</a>  but you will start the next year one percent higher. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1973.997">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1974.457">Well,</a>  if you're a brand new teacher making fifty two thousand dollars, right, you're going to get five hundred and twenty dollars into your full year schedule the next year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1986.182">Break</a>  that over 26 checks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1988.463">It's</a>  not a lot of money, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1990.704">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1991.445">Plus.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1992.565">Plus,</a>  then the next time we negotiate, because this has happened in the past, what's their answer going to be? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1997.994">We</a>  just gave you one percent.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=1999.396">Hmm.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2000.358">So</a>  that's the fear of the members that it's going to carry over to be like, well, we just gave you one percent.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2005.347">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2005.787">So</a>  now we're only going to give you maybe two. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2007.068">Now</a>  we're only going to give you two. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2008.849">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2009.55">Well,</a>  we're only going to give you one because real quickly now you're getting a 2% raise.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2012.912">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2013.192">So</a>  these are the- I feel like we're on the last day because it's going to carry into the next year.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2017.815">And</a>  that's the result.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2021.257">So</a>  you're negotiating a contract that has been expired for over a year, is that right?</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2026.39">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2026.77">June</a>  of twenty one.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2028.091">You're.</a> </p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2029.392">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2030.373">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2031.013">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2031.454">And</a>  so when is the next when would you when would you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2060.713">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2061.054">So</a>  next spring, we'll technically, not this year, but... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2066.797">In</a>  the last year of the contract, that spring, we'll request to meet again to start negotiations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2075.3">You</a>  know, so it will only be one working year before we're back at negotiating again.</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2083.193">You</a>  know, and so that's been, you know, that's been, you know, and there's a concern about, you know, money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2089.297">I</a>  mean, you know, the city, you know, with the money and, you know, we have the ESSER funds and the district has come out and school committee has come out and said, you can't use those ESSER funds to maintain teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2101.625">We've</a>  shown them documentation, legal, you know, documentation from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2106.088">you</a>  know, all over and other schools are using that money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2109.611">So</a>  that money is there to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2112.553">And</a>  they keep saying they can't do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2114.654">And</a>  that is, you know, from the education, Cardoza has stated that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2119.578">So</a>  those are, you know, in the Chapter 70 money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2122.701">I</a>  mean, you know, the district is saying they're not going to get the Chapter 70 money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2126.083">Well,</a>  they got it this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2127.544">And</a>  the new elected governor, Healy, has said, we're putting that money in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2132.626">So</a>  Medford is scheduled to get that Chapter 70 money over the next years, which would be anywhere, I think, up to $5 million of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2142.15">And</a>  then we just worked really, really hard to get passage of the millionaire's tax, as you know, MTA, so to get more monies into our schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2151.253">And</a>  we have the elected body there of the school committee who are, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2156.395">you</a>  know, progressives and have stated that, you know, they supported question one, they supported the various questions, but then they're saying something very, very different. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2167.197">They're</a>  saying, no, we don't have that money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2169.158">Well,</a>  then why do we do all this fighting for? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2173.099">And</a>  why is that, and that money is there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2175.299">And</a>  that's another big frustration for us, you know, and for them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2180.28">I</a>  mean, and even for their political stance, it's confusing.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2183.601">Yeah,</a>  I can hear that maybe part of the answer you're getting is like, we don't have this money or that's not part of the budget that we're going to allocate to teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2193.649">And</a>  the budget is sort of a statement of your values in the same way, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2198.292">Like</a>  if we care about education, if we care about teachers and the way that we've had to lean on teachers and education throughout COVID, how do we not adjust the budget in order to meet these needs, right?</p>

    <p>[Charlene Douglas]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2210.233">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2210.714">And</a>  that's very and that's how the members of Philly and it's, you know, you know, enjoying you can agree with me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7GtG3h9u5vpJup5nqgNiHT?t=2217.142">Right.</a> </p>
