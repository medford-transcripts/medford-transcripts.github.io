All please rise and salute our flag.

18
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,193
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

19
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:33,680
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Motion for approval.

48
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:42,362
Motion for approval by Ms.

49
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:44,143

The motion passes.

53
00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:00,285
Report of secretary.

54
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:01,485
None.

55
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:03,226
Report of committees.

56
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:04,347
Committee of the whole meeting.

57
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,202
The meeting was called to order by Vice Chairperson Anne Marie Pugno at 7.06 p.m.

58
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,523
in the superintendent's conference room.

59
00:02:38,038 --> 00:03:01,083
President Superintendent Roy Bellson, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Vocational Principal Director Heidi Riccio, Director of Finance and Administration Christine Patterson, and Director of Buildings and Grounds John McLaughlin, parents Sarah O'Grady, Melissa McGinnis, Carolyn Montello, and Michelle Ciccolo, all rose to salute the flag.

60
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:06,424
Vice Chair Cunha stated the purpose of the meeting was to continue our discussions on capital planning,

61
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:08,886
projects for the Medford public schools.

62
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:13,129
Vice Chair Cuno called upon the superintendent to begin the discussion.

63
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:21,015
The superintendent reiterated the importance of understanding the difference between capital planning projects and general repair and maintenance issues.

64
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:24,217
Capital planning is usually a multi-year group of projects.

65
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:28,519
Such projects generally require a mix of bonding, grants, and revenues.

66
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,763
The superintendent listed the capital projects that have been completed since FY 2000, which are attached.

67
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,986
Secretary Vander Kloot pointed out that the pool and the boiler project should be added to the list.

68
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:42,095
The superintendent stressed the importance of getting started.

69
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:46,499
Capital projects often take multiple years to get approval from the funding agencies.

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,842
Additionally, there are many non-school projects that need to be addressed.

71
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,406
There must be a balance between city and school priorities as we go forward.

72
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:55,848
Mayor Burke joined the meeting and assumed the chair.

73
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:57,850
The mayor was attending a city council meeting.

74
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,031
Oops.

75
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:03,526
Each committee member was provided with a packet of materials.

76
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:10,252
The superintendent identified capital plan proposed on August 5th, 2016 for the committee's reference.

77
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:16,478
This discussion then reviewed the statement of interest, which was approved by the school committee at their last regular meeting.

78
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:21,117
This is only the first step toward acquiring MSBA funding assistance.

79
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:27,479
Dr. Heidi Riccio then detailed three grant awards that are moving forward to enable major improvements in program development.

80
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:28,899
They are attached.

81
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:38,303
The three grants are the Massachusetts Life Sciences Grant for $98,516, which will support the development of our robotics and engineering programs.

82
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:45,547
Number two is the capital skills grant for $500,000 to support the development of our culinary and hospitality program.

83
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:50,590
We will match this funding with both in-kind assistance from our partners in industry and labor.

84
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,553
Also, we will use funding that is in the reserve contingency from the science labs project.

85
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,634
This will require council approval.

86
00:04:57,915 --> 00:05:04,619
Third is regional services grant for $200,000 to expand our shops to accommodate enrollment increases.

87
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:06,740
The focus of this grant will be

88
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,562
on our electrical program and related areas.

89
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:14,566
It will facilitate the inclusion with students from Everett who will pay a tuition.

90
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:17,008
Currently we have 25 Everett students.

91
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:20,911
We expect to increase the number of tuition students to 100 over time.

92
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,753
We are also recapturing tuitions from Minuteman.

93
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:29,738
The grants will be supplemented by in-kind work by the laborers and Wynn as well as the other industry partners.

94
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:36,503
The development of our shop spaces will also enable us to serve adult learners and to maximize the use of our facility.

95
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:40,035
The laborers will also help increase handicap accessibility.

96
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,398
The discussion moved to the high school roof.

97
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:44,781
See infrared roof survey.

98
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:46,824
The high school roof needs some small repairs.

99
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:50,719
that could be accomplished for about $25,000 to $30,000 this summer.

100
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,621
We would expect to consider roof replacement beginning with 2020.

101
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:56,183
This would be done in sections.

102
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:58,705
The outside schools are still in good shape.

103
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:01,346
They have another 10 years before possible replacement.

104
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:04,008
Mr. McLaughlin was present to ask their questions.

105
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:11,093
Mr. McLaughlin then discussed the emergency repairs to the heating system pipes in A building, which is attached.

106
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:12,774
A financial account was provided.

107
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:23,010
Member me I'm stony asked how we could fund find funding for this type of repair also why we are not finding money for building appearance projects the superintendent explained that

108
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:26,776
He would have had to shut down a building if the repairs were not made.

109
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:31,457
It is not uncommon to divert funding for emergency repairs.

110
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:38,039
He also reiterated his plan to add additional funds to the operational budget next year for general repairs.

111
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,201
Member Erinda Benedetto asked that the hanging wires in the conference room be removed from sight.

112
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:53,204
Mr. Scurry urged more cosmetic work be done, and members Cuneo and Van de Kloot recognized the need to do more with appearance, but supported the priority of emergency repairs.

113
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:54,161
Ms.

114
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:57,484
Vander Kloot asked for a report on the bleachers at our K-8 schools.

115
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:03,248
The superintendent referenced the report from Mr. McLaughlin regarding the need to repair air conditioning compressors.

116
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:06,931
While the schools are functional, there could be better efficiency.

117
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,093
There's also an attached listing there.

118
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:16,178
Curb replacement and parking lot resurfing was discussed with emphasis on the high school McGlynn and Andrews, a report is attached.

119
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,781
Playground replacement at the elementary schools was discussed.

120
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:21,438
Pricing is now being sought.

121
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:26,621
There is some possible mitigation linkage from a developer to assist with the Roberts playground.

122
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:31,083
The committee received the draft executive summary for our school technology.

123
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:35,685
As we move forward, technology is central to our educational and operational programs.

124
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:46,191
Testing, state, federal funding, reporting, and instruction are more and more dependent on a robust and reliable technology, sorry, infrastructure and tools.

125
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:47,932
We are eligible

126
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:51,399
for substantial funding from the e-rate program under tier two.

127
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,579
This will require a 40% match.

128
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:57,520
Technology capital investment must be an essential part of our capital plan.

129
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:00,501
Almost made it.

130
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,521
On the motion of Mr. Scarry, seconded by Ms.

131
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,822
Cuneo, the meeting was adjourned at 8.55 p.m.

132
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:06,802
Respectfully submitted.

133
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:07,322
Thank you very much, Ms.

134
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:07,783
Van de Kloot.

135
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:09,723
Are there any questions from the floor?

136
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:10,463
Mr. Benedetto.

137
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,583
Thank you.

138
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:17,865
So there was a report requested from the superintendent, so we should add that to list to make sure that we get follow-up on that.

139
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:23,588
The report of the condition of all the bleachers district wide that Ms.

140
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,770
Van de Koot reminded us of at that meeting.

141
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,290
Mr. Skerry.

142
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:26,651
Mr. Skerry.

143
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:27,952
Mr. Skerry.

144
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:28,232
Mr. Skerry.

145
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:28,492
Mr. Skerry.

146
00:08:28,752 --> 00:08:29,012
Mr. Skerry.

147
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:29,433
Mr. Skerry.

148
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:29,753
Mr. Skerry.

149
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:29,973
Mr. Skerry.

150
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:30,173
Mr. Skerry.

151
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:30,453
Mr. Skerry.

152
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:30,734
Mr. Skerry.

153
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:30,974
Mr. Skerry.

154
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:31,574
Mr. Skerry.

155
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:31,855
Mr. Skerry.

156
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,135
Mr. Skerry.

157
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:32,355
Mr. Skerry.

158
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:32,635
Mr. Skerry.

159
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:33,076
Mr. Skerry.

160
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:33,436
Mr. Skerry.

161
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:34,156
Mr. Skerry.

162
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:34,397
Mr. Skerry.

163
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:34,637
Mr. Skerry.

164
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:34,917
Mr. Skerry.

165
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:35,938
Mr. Skerry.

166
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:36,178
Mr. Skerry.

167
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:36,959
Mr. Skerry.

168
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:37,319
Mr. Skerry.

169
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:37,939
Mr. Skerry.

170
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:38,300
Mr. Skerry.

171
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,920
Mr. Skerry.

172
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,340
Mr. Skerry.

173
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,981
Mr. Skerry.

174
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:59,319
So I had been out to see the Brooks School, and when I was there for the visit, because I was doing this for the capital plan visit, I spoke with the assistant principal, and we looked at the outside upper play structure.

175
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:09,565
There's a fence side, like a gate that's missing, so the children, like the ball will go outside the gate, so there's no, like one half where you can close the gate.

176
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:11,426
One half is just gone.

177
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,223
And that was in like October.

178
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:18,464
So I don't know if anybody's been out there to repair it, but that really needs to get done.

179
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:33,389
And they also needed some signage, you know, because I think some during school hours, you know, community, you know, people are just going to use the park, but during school hours that are operational.

180
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:36,950
So they were just looking for some signage that they could put up.

181
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,817
The intercom system wasn't working properly in their walkie-talkies.

182
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:44,398
And I had done that.

183
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,058
The playground equipment?

184
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,659
The intercom and the playground equipment?

185
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,640
The intercom and the school wasn't working properly.

186
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,360
Inside the school, okay.

187
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,423
Yeah, so I don't know if I, this was during my own visit when I conducted in like October.

188
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:58,185
So I wanted to mention that.

189
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:04,768
And I did receive some calls from parents, they were very,

190
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:08,927
curious and interested in finding out about the discussion we had.

191
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,969
Some of them couldn't make the committee of the whole meeting.

192
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:23,039
So I sent Mr. Belson a note in asking if we could put something together on blog similar to what Lisa Evangelista posted for the grant publications.

193
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:31,607
If we could put together just a brief description of the capital improvements that have been done, very similar to what we got in the breakdown

194
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:44,180
Um, even with the timelines going back to 2002 so we can have that nice breakdown that we can share with the community, including some of the new, you know, proposed capital budget, um, plans.

195
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:53,405
Um, and, and a lot of the community was very interested and, you know, happy to read all the, um, the posts that we shared this weekend about the grants.

196
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:53,905
Very good.

197
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:54,466
Thank you, miss.

198
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:54,766
Correct.

199
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:58,388
Their emotion to receive this report and place it on file.

200
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:01,292
Motion for approval, seconded by Ms.

201
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:01,812
Van de Kloot.

202
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:02,673
All those in favor?

203
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:04,393
All those opposed?

204
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:05,813
Motion is granted.

205
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,674
Would a school committee member move suspension to take item nine out of order?

206
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:13,074
Motion for suspension by Ms.

207
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,315
Van de Kloot, seconded by Ms.

208
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:14,835
Disceri.

209
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:15,635
All those in favor?

210
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:16,855
All those opposed?

211
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:17,895
Suspension is granted.

212
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:27,657
Report on Medford High Ethics Bowl team achievements and recommendation to approve participation at National High School Ethics Bowl in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

213
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:30,146
Mr. Superintendent.

214
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:35,549
Mayor Burke, members of the committee.

215
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:38,670
Nicole Chiesa, Dr. Nicole Chiesa is here.

216
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:45,193
She's the head of the department, which oversees the Ethics Bowl team and the Ethics Bowl team is here.

217
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,493
They've been very successful.

218
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:56,798
They won the Tufts, they won the regional, and now they have an opportunity to go to the nationals and compete with 23 other school systems across the country.

219
00:11:57,944 --> 00:12:05,849
And I wanted to give this report, and then we'll make arrangements possibly to send the team to Chapel Hill to come back with a trophy from Medford.

220
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,509
Ms.

221
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:10,032
Gaze, would you like to step up here so you can announce and then help give them out?

222
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:31,750
Would you like to say a few words first?

223
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,430
Certainly.

224
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:32,930
Thank you.

225
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:36,511
Good evening.

226
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:41,353
We've had the Ethics Bowl team here in Medford since 2013.

227
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:47,875
It originated as a partnership between Tufts University's Department of Philosophy and Medford High School.

228
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:51,076
And since that time, Mr. Esner has been the advisor.

229
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:54,937
We have reported some major successes this year.

230
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:57,538
They competed at Tufts University.

231
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,157
and did very well.

232
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:03,277
They had multiple rounds of competition to face.

233
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:10,219
They beat out different schools, including Phillips Exeter, Rosemary Choate Hall, and Newton South.

234
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,200
So we were very, very proud of that accomplishment.

235
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,481
That was the regional competition held at Tufts.

236
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:27,524
That made these students eligible to participate in the playoff competition, which was actually done virtually through, I believe, Google Hangouts, which was kind of exciting in and of itself.

237
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:32,546
And once again, the team was successful in winning that playoff round.

238
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:38,351
So we are just so thrilled and pleased with all of their hard work and energy.

239
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,792
It's an after-school club.

240
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:41,053
They volunteer their time.

241
00:13:41,093 --> 00:13:42,333
Mr. Esner does as well.

242
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:46,677
And I want to personally thank Mr. Esner for all of his hard work with everything.

243
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:48,818
And we'd like to recognize the students as well.

244
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:49,239
Excellent.

245
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:49,799
Very good.

246
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:51,961
Thank you, Mr. Esner.

247
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:52,661
Yeah, my pleasure.

248
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:56,464
If we could have the students line up on the side here.

249
00:14:00,415 --> 00:14:07,522
The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Tamar Brandeskrug, Exemplary Participation, Medford High School Ethics Bowl Team.

250
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:08,402
Tamar?

251
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:19,573
How are you?

252
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:20,393
Congratulations.

253
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:20,774
Thank you.

254
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:23,316
Congratulations.

255
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:23,716
Tamar.

256
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:26,359
Maria Camona.

257
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:42,187
Sean Driscoll Gomez Raquel Fiorotti

258
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:10,393
Mary Nagos.

259
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:19,742
Congratulations.

260
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:20,403
Great job.

261
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:22,084
Congratulations.

262
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:24,827
Tenzin Rigzin.

263
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:31,554
Augusta Standeven.

264
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,539
Sebastian Tringali.

265
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:04,311
I've asked the students if they could just stay up here so perhaps we could do a photo.

266
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:11,075
The other thing that I would like to do is I would like to make a put forth a resolution that the

267
00:16:11,497 --> 00:16:17,040
Medford Public Schools pay for our students to attend the competition in North Carolina.

268
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:28,165
And if Mr. Eisner is willing, we certainly would certainly appreciate his accompanying our team in doing whatever we can do, because I am so, so proud of you.

269
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:30,666
If you guys could come up.

270
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:35,708
On the motion, as seconded by Mrs. Currie, roll call vote.

271
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:36,849
Mrs. Cuneo?

272
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:37,609
Yes.

273
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,430
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

274
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:38,510
Yes.

275
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:40,704
Mrs. Kretz?

276
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,787
Mrs. McStone is absent, but she'd vote yes, I know that.

277
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:45,849
Mr. Skerry?

278
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,230
Yes.

279
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,331
Mrs. Vander Kloot?

280
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:47,631
Yes.

281
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:48,652
Mayor Burke?

282
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:49,073
Yes.

283
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:50,474
You're going to North Carolina?

284
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:51,956
One absent, motion passes.

285
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,380
Mr. Eisen would like to say a few words on behalf of these wonderful students.

286
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,800
Thank you.

287
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,922
I'd just like to say what a great job you guys have done.

288
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:04,263
And I'm so proud of you.

289
00:17:04,843 --> 00:17:07,946
And I can't wait to see how you guys do in North Carolina.

290
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,407
And as you said, bring back the trophy.

291
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,769
And thank you to the school committee for your support.

292
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:12,910
Everyone else, thank you.

293
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:19,315
We're very appreciative to all the work that you've put into this as well.

294
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,236
And kudos to wonderful jobs.

295
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:21,857
Thank you very much.

296
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:24,259
You're welcome.

297
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:45,194
advisors, not to put any pressure on any of you, I'd like to know what type of questions do they ask you?

298
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:58,045
Absolutely, come on up.

299
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:05,512
Macklemore, a popular entertainer, especially in the early 2010s, is it morally permissible for a white person

300
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:09,206
to lead or be the face of an organization called Black Lives Matter.

301
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:13,647
Another question we had, currently we're working on the heroin epidemic.

302
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:16,428
Who should have access to Narcan?

303
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,129
Who should be able to administrate it?

304
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:25,931
And is there a big moral difference if you're taking away one of the greatest consequences of drug abuse, which would be an overdose?

305
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,152
We have things of that nature.

306
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:27,892
OK.

307
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:32,233
And so when you answer these questions, is it in an essay form?

308
00:20:32,513 --> 00:20:34,654
How long do they give you to answer the question?

309
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:40,414
You've won it, you might as well explain it.

310
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:49,376
So the way we answer the questions is in a debate format.

311
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:57,859
So it starts by there's two teams, Team A and Team B. And Team A is presented with a case and a question about the case.

312
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:01,080
And then we have five minutes to present our main argument.

313
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:08,103
Then Team B has three minutes, I believe, to either add on to our argument or present their personal view.

314
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:13,705
And then Team A has another two or three minutes to respond to Team B's commentary.

315
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:14,865
And how long does it take?

316
00:21:15,247 --> 00:21:19,410
Do the rounds usually last?

317
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,151
45 minutes a round?

318
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:22,273
And how many rounds do you do?

319
00:21:25,395 --> 00:21:25,795
Wow.

320
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:27,176
Wow.

321
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:29,098
That's incredible.

322
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:32,240
And just out of curiosity, how much is the trip going to cost?

323
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:35,223
I know we're putting it in, but I'd like to know how much it does cost.

324
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,190
For person or overall?

325
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:51,094
With lodging and overall cost, we're looking at about between $5,000 and $6,000 total for airfare as well as lodging.

326
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:54,214
Most meals are included in there as well.

327
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:55,535
And how long is the trip?

328
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,212
Sorry, guys.

329
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:00,193
You don't have to move out of the way.

330
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:00,893
I just need to scoot in.

331
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:01,674
I'm sorry.

332
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:09,123
The trip, they're going to be leaving Friday morning, April 7th, with a return on Monday morning, April 10th.

333
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,106
There's a nice reception there on Friday.

334
00:22:12,527 --> 00:22:17,492
Competition begins Saturday and Sunday, with the final round not ending until about 6.30 that night.

335
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:20,454
Well, congratulations.

336
00:22:20,494 --> 00:22:20,935
Good luck.

337
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:21,655
We're proud of you.

338
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,395
We cannot be any more prouder.

339
00:22:23,815 --> 00:22:25,536
Well, when you bring back the other award.

340
00:22:26,296 --> 00:22:27,937
And let us know how you make out.

341
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:32,998
I think we should acknowledge our captains, Mary and Tamar, and then our seniors, Raquel and Gus.

342
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:34,019
Very nice.

343
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:34,499
Very nice.

344
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:36,219
Thank you.

345
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,420
Good luck, and come back.

346
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:39,761
Good luck.

347
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:43,222
We're proud of you in any way, any way, shape, or form.

348
00:22:44,682 --> 00:22:45,382
Thank you so much.

349
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:45,783
Thank you.

350
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:51,578
I just want to say some food for thought.

351
00:22:52,078 --> 00:23:00,382
This particular year it seems like we've been really blessed with more and more students coming to us and achieving so much.

352
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:05,124
It seems like we're having more and more students going out of state for these competitions.

353
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:05,984
As Ms.

354
00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:10,586
Van de Kloot had motioned for us to pass and make sure that we pay for this trip

355
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:24,149
I think it's just food for thought that we might start thinking about this when the budget comes around and really put a budget line for these types of trips because you don't want to be in a situation where we're approving one particular team and not approving the other.

356
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:30,851
And we don't want to make anyone feel that what they're doing for us is any less worth what they're doing.

357
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:35,192
So just as a matter of fact, just to make it as food for thought, that was it.

358
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:35,812
Very good.

359
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,572
Thank you very much.

360
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:38,613
Thank you.

361
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:43,997
Next up, community participation.

362
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:45,917
I don't believe we have anything on the agenda for that.

363
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:46,818
Okay.

364
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:54,181
Report number one, recommendation to accept gift from Thomas Sutherland in memory of Jean Barry Sutherland.

365
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,542
Mr. Superintendent, there's a motion on the floor.

366
00:23:56,562 --> 00:24:11,348
Members of the committee, Thomas Sutherland, the husband of Jean Barry Sutherland, would like to make a major donation to Columbus School area site in memory and in honor of

367
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,206
former principal, Jean Barry Sutherland.

368
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:19,168
Um, the gift would be a bench and a plaque to be installed on the Columbus ground.

369
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,828
So we recommend that you accept it.

370
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,429
Mr. Sutherland is here, I believe.

371
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:23,189
Nope.

372
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:23,430
Nope.

373
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,010
I don't think so.

374
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,250
I don't see him.

375
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,872
There's a motion for approval by Mr. Scarry, seconded by Ms.

376
00:24:29,012 --> 00:24:29,332
Pritz.

377
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:31,473
Roll call vote, please.

378
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:34,154
Certainly.

379
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:38,776
We all know that Jean Barry Sutherland meant an awful lot to this community.

380
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:41,297
She was a remarkable woman, both in her life,

381
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:47,690
and also as she was approaching the end of her life and was really an inspiration in so many ways for all of us.

382
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:57,675
This is very fitting, and I'm thankful to her husband, Thomas, for making this a lasting tribute to her on our school grounds, which she loves so dearly.

383
00:24:58,365 --> 00:24:59,065
Thank you very much.

384
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:09,912
I had the privilege of meeting with Mrs. Sutherland, and he's just so thrilled to be able to recognize her years of service to the city of Medford and Medford Public Schools, and especially the Columbus School, which was her home school.

385
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:14,295
And she was there when the new schools were opened, and she was a staple in that community.

386
00:25:14,355 --> 00:25:25,301
So she's dearly missed, but this will provide a reflective area for the students, the parents, and teachers, I would imagine, and administrators to pay homage to her deeds.

387
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:27,683
So we're very proud to be able to do this for them.

388
00:25:28,257 --> 00:25:30,998
And as soon as we have a date, we believe it's early April, but we'll let you know.

389
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:32,098
Sure.

390
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:32,778
Call the roll.

391
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:33,898
Roll call vote, please.

392
00:25:34,058 --> 00:25:40,700
Mrs. Cuneo, Mrs. DiBenedetto, Mrs. Kratz, Mrs. Mastone, Mr. Scurry.

393
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,100
Yes.

394
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,100
Mrs. Vanderklift.

395
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,380
Yes.

396
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:42,900
Mayor Burke.

397
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,460
Yes.

398
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,601
Seven in the affirmative, zero on the negative.

399
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:46,481
The motion passes.

400
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:50,602
Item two, recommendation to approve school calendar, a school year 2017-18.

401
00:25:50,622 --> 00:25:56,843
So as we get into this time of year, people ask the question frequently,

402
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,254
When will school start?

403
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:00,995
When will be the vacation periods and the like?

404
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:04,678
This is a draft that requires your approval.

405
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:11,603
I'm gonna call on our deputy superintendent to go over the particulars and to tell you why we picked certain dates the way we did.

406
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:13,564
Good evening.

407
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:20,749
We're asking tonight that we approve our calendar moving forward to the following school year so families can plan.

408
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,250
Everybody has an idea of what's going on.

409
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:25,712
As you can see, this year we've

410
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,279
adopted a new format.

411
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:39,144
My thanks to my assistant Jeannie Gliona for working very diligently, making everything fit nicely, and we feel that it's very readable and concise for everyone.

412
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:48,369
The current teacher's contract calls for the school to start every year now before Labor Day, the Monday before Labor Day.

413
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,830
Again, this is not a decision that administration makes.

414
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,911
This is something that

415
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:56,284
is set in the teacher's contract by negotiation.

416
00:26:57,225 --> 00:27:02,828
And therefore, the start of the school year for teachers this year will be Monday, August 28th.

417
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:09,633
The contract was also very specific for how that first week would be organized.

418
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:16,157
The Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of that week prior to Labor Day, students will be in session.

419
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:21,341
And then Friday, the Friday before Labor Day, everyone will have a holiday.

420
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,848
So again, that was something that is in the teacher's contract.

421
00:27:25,168 --> 00:27:32,736
This is the second year that we've adopted this schedule, and we want to make sure that parents get that information.

422
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:41,825
We know we've been asking principals to reinforce it so that parents understand that vacation really kind of has to stop at the end of August.

423
00:27:46,189 --> 00:27:53,134
Students, again, would return to school after Labor Day on September 5th, with kindergarten students beginning on the 6th.

424
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:58,538
The calendar has the required number of days, with five snow days built in.

425
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,921
And if we were to use those snow days, the end of school would be June 20th.

426
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,422
If we don't use it, we back it up.

427
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:15,710
And again, the calendar has the standard school vacations, legal holidays, the mandated, or actually the early release days that are mandated by

428
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:18,246
the contract for middle and high school.

429
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:29,672
And again, we have two full days of professional development, and we've set those for Tuesday, November 7th, and Monday, March 12th.

430
00:28:31,393 --> 00:28:38,637
We strongly recommend that the calendar be approved as early as possible, and if you have any questions or comments.

431
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,058
Yes, Van de Kloot.

432
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:49,217
Beverly, I thought that the last year that we've been setting in more like seven snow days, not five.

433
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:53,698
So I was surprised to see that this was, in my eyes, rolled back to five.

434
00:28:54,478 --> 00:29:04,940
I would have thought that we would have called the end of school the 22nd, for instance, so to set expectations that it could go that late.

435
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:07,581
So I'd like the superintendent.

436
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:09,201
So let me just answer that.

437
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:12,162
By rule, with the Department of Ed, we have to make

438
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:16,194
allowance for five days, but we actually have another seven days if we needed it.

439
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:21,334
So we really have 12 days available to us, not counting if we were to reclaim a professional day.

440
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:27,775
So remember, if the last day with five days is the 20th of June, you still got to the 30th of June if we actually needed it.

441
00:29:28,356 --> 00:29:31,016
So we've really built in quite a bit of protection.

442
00:29:31,576 --> 00:29:33,396
Yes, I guess I'm looking at it a different way.

443
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:42,138
If I'm a parent thinking about making plans, if you say the end of the school is the 22nd, well, then I'm going to be thinking I'm going to make my plans starting the 23rd.

444
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,624
If you say it's the 20th, then I'm going to start making them the 21st.

445
00:29:45,644 --> 00:29:48,665
We can put a one-liner in the notice out there.

446
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:49,565
We can make that change.

447
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:51,706
We can put seven snow days built in.

448
00:29:51,726 --> 00:29:52,666
This is just the draft.

449
00:29:53,426 --> 00:30:05,010
I'd like some other feedback, but I'm thinking that it's better to set people's expectations that there could be the possibility, because if we go back to two years ago in 2015 when we had so many snowstorms,

450
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:08,197
I just, I think it's an expectation thing.

451
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:09,298
What do others think?

452
00:30:09,318 --> 00:30:10,279
We have built in this year, five?

453
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:11,179
Yeah, we do.

454
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:12,560
We should do five.

455
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,362
We built in probably 11 days.

456
00:30:14,402 --> 00:30:16,363
Well, and the calendar itself says five.

457
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:17,224
The calendar has five.

458
00:30:17,264 --> 00:30:20,767
But we know that we can go by teacher's contract to the 30th of June.

459
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:23,028
So in effect, it's built in.

460
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:25,951
But it's not a bad suggestion that we do this.

461
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:29,153
We can make that adjustment if the committee wants to go that route.

462
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:35,518
We can put a statement and should, you know, we require more days because of snow or other inclement weather or other reasons.

463
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:36,238
Yeah.

464
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,679
If we just did some further clarification.

465
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:39,619
Okay, fine.

466
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:42,219
Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

467
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,060
Thank you.

468
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,980
You all set.

469
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:44,880
Okay.

470
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,140
And I agree with you.

471
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:57,363
I think the comment at the bottom is an important piece that parents can, but most, most parents know this from being for a while, but it's the younger parents.

472
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,623
I mean, parents of younger students.

473
00:31:00,132 --> 00:31:03,273
that might need that to be listed on there.

474
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:07,973
My comment is just November 7th, it says professional development day.

475
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:18,275
It seems weird to have a day off on a Tuesday and then on a Friday, I just want people, I understand that, but I'm not sure everybody reading this quickly is gonna say, oh, why is that?

476
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:22,036
That seems like a strange week to have a Tuesday and a Friday off the same week.

477
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:26,697
So, you know, maybe next to it, professional development day,

478
00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:32,058
put also election day or something so parents know that it can't be changed.

479
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:36,801
It wasn't like a choice, it's like we do that for the safety of the schools and the students.

480
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:40,203
So that way people aren't roaming the buildings on election day.

481
00:31:41,384 --> 00:31:41,704
Okay.

482
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:43,445
Ms.

483
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:43,766
Kritz.

484
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:46,527
Oh, I wanted to thank Beverly.

485
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:54,633
I ran into her at the school and we started to get inquiries already asking when we were going back to school and some parents

486
00:31:55,713 --> 00:32:01,835
really didn't know that, in fact, I didn't really know that it was part of the contract that the teachers had to start school early.

487
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:05,937
I misunderstood, I thought it was administration also, so I'm glad you explained that.

488
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:18,541
Would there be any way to maybe just put something under the bottom explaining that as per collective bargaining agreement, the start of school would be before Labor Day?

489
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:22,002
There was a lot of communication about that.

490
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:24,103
A lot of people weren't happy about

491
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:30,943
going back to school before Labor Day, you know, I was getting inquiries myself, you know, why are we going back before Labor Day?

492
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:35,226
I don't like that, you know, but yeah.

493
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:38,688
So we used to go back in Medford after Labor Day.

494
00:32:39,188 --> 00:32:41,229
And in fact, many families preferred it.

495
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,951
And certainly the teachers did.

496
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:46,813
The fact of the matter was with them, we were running into a problem because we were going too late.

497
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:50,111
too far into June because we were getting more snow days.

498
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:52,833
We went through a period of years where we were getting a lot of snow days.

499
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:58,398
And so, with the cooperation of the Teachers Union, we then moved it back.

500
00:32:58,878 --> 00:32:59,599
Is it preferable?

501
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:01,180
Well, not necessarily.

502
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,245
It depends on who you talk to, but it's because of — I mean, if we could predict snow days, we wouldn't be doing this, but we can't.

503
00:33:08,026 --> 00:33:15,632
And if teachers were unhappy, they were really, really, really unhappy if, you know, school went to June 30th or, you know, when it went that late.

504
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:16,773
So, that's why.

505
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:20,655
And this is quite typical of most school systems now.

506
00:33:20,675 --> 00:33:24,097
Most school systems are back before.

507
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:26,518
There were a few times we started before Labor Day.

508
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:30,780
The previous contract said school could not start before September 1st.

509
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,662
But there were the occasions that September 1st was before Labor Day.

510
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:41,545
So we did, a few years here and there, depending upon the fall of Labor Day, we did start before.

511
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:46,228
But again, now it's pretty much cast in stone in the contract.

512
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:52,409
quite honestly, this was something that the teachers' union kind of promoted more than we did.

513
00:33:52,429 --> 00:34:01,214
I think teachers feel it's much more advantageous for children to be out of school earlier in June, because, you know, it gets hot, they get tired, and so on.

514
00:34:01,254 --> 00:34:07,358
And so it's something that they promoted, and we thought it was a good idea, too, but it was promoted by the union.

515
00:34:08,158 --> 00:34:15,863
In terms of adding anything, pretty much everything in the contract, like the early release dates, is contractual, and there's only so much language we can add.

516
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:19,394
I know Jeannie was trying to squeeze things in to get everything in.

517
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:30,956
We can try if you feel that that's important to her contract to put it in, but just getting the word out that this is in the teacher's contract and principals have been promoting that idea.

518
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,737
So hopefully people, and this is the second year.

519
00:34:34,257 --> 00:34:35,537
Okay, we did it last year.

520
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:37,777
The teachers were very specific.

521
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:40,438
They did not want a professional development day that first week.

522
00:34:40,858 --> 00:34:43,459
They wanted students in school for three consecutive days.

523
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,139
So that was pretty much set by them.

524
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:47,880
Thank you.

525
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,300
Okay.

526
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,481
Motion of approval.

527
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:50,522
Mr. Benedetto.

528
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:57,507
Also, another point is a lot of school systems around the United States start earlier than we do in New England.

529
00:34:58,068 --> 00:35:03,252
And they'll all students take the AP exams in the SATs at the same time.

530
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:10,737
So if we're not in school as many days as others, we don't cover as much material as others.

531
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:15,321
And they're judged throughout the United States on their performance.

532
00:35:15,932 --> 00:35:24,935
So we need to be in school a certain amount of days to get the education in for them to be prepared for these exams.

533
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:38,019
Some schools start early August, but and with our snow days, we could even have weeks less time to prepare for these exams than people in other parts of the country.

534
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:43,481
And it's really important to get these days in and the education started for us.

535
00:35:43,915 --> 00:35:44,655
for our students.

536
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:49,577
So that's another reason why I totally agreed with starting this before Labor Day.

537
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:50,877
That's an excellent point.

538
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:56,018
And also, you know, we have our regular state testing that takes place in April and May.

539
00:35:56,758 --> 00:36:01,460
Communities that start before Labor Day, the students have a whole week of more prep.

540
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,481
And what you said with snow days, it's very hard to predict already.

541
00:36:04,521 --> 00:36:06,621
You know, we're saying we lost a few days here and there.

542
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:07,441
Are we going to make it up?

543
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:13,623
So it's for the AP exams and plus just the regular state exams, having that instructional time.

544
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:16,746
I think most students are ready to come back.

545
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:21,190
I think it's kind of gearing up that last week in August, so hopefully they are.

546
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:22,332
In their parents.

547
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:23,333
In their parents.

548
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:24,874
Ms.

549
00:36:24,914 --> 00:36:25,335
Cuno.

550
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:29,279
Actually, everything has been asked, so I'm all set.

551
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:29,699
Thank you.

552
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,922
There's a motion on the floor for approval by Ms.

553
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,583
Van de Kloop, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

554
00:36:33,904 --> 00:36:34,845
Roll call vote, please.

555
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,419
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

556
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:47,259
Motion passes.

557
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,120
Report on March 13th, 2017 professional development day.

558
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,861
Mr. Superintendent.

559
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:59,342
So our deputy superintendent, our assistant superintendent have led the charge in putting this program together.

560
00:36:59,362 --> 00:37:05,444
It's done with a great deal of input from the teachers and others, and it's a lot of work involved.

561
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:10,205
So congratulations to both of them putting together a very interesting day and let them tell you about it.

562
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:12,642
Diane and I have been emailing all weekend.

563
00:37:13,743 --> 00:37:15,604
She's tired of seeing my emails on Sunday.

564
00:37:16,304 --> 00:37:24,849
But again, Monday, March 13, a week from today, will be our second full day of professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals.

565
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,291
There is no school for students that day.

566
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,253
Again, there are lots of different activities.

567
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:35,436
When we did this report last week, we hadn't ironed out as much as now we have together.

568
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:37,377
And we'll give you a full report on the 20th.

569
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:59,717
But part of the day, as all of you know, we had a very exciting professional development program this year for the first time, where teachers on November 8th, our first full day of professional development, they engaged in a round robin exploring three very important themes that were identified as themes that we wanted to pursue, teachers wanted to pursue further.

570
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:01,959
And this was based on their own surveys.

571
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:04,821
And one of those themes was at-risk students.

572
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:06,582
The second one was special education.

573
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,381
And a third was social-emotional learning.

574
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:15,462
After November 8th, every teacher in the school district said, I want to go with one theme.

575
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:21,804
And so they continue with that theme throughout the school year on our mandated PD days.

576
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:23,984
And it's the elementary and the middle and the high school.

577
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:27,545
Again, who facilitated those workshops?

578
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:28,485
Our own staff.

579
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,605
They were magnificent.

580
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:30,746
It was wonderful.

581
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:31,786
Teachers stepped up.

582
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:33,226
They organized workshops.

583
00:38:33,926 --> 00:38:36,247
And they were very well received.

584
00:38:36,671 --> 00:38:49,595
So we were very excited about this because teachers were telling us that sometimes PD they felt was like one day and it was done and they wanted to have it more ongoing and sustainable and I think that we accomplished that.

585
00:38:49,735 --> 00:39:00,658
So on the 13th we're going to use half of the day to bring closure to whatever theme the teacher had selected for this particular school year.

586
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,800
So teachers will be with their groups working on whatever they were working on throughout the school year.

587
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:25,088
And then the second half of the day, we're going to have teachers going back to buildings, and in most cases, the principals are going to lead them in test prep, because we have the English MCAS, the new test, MCAS 2.0, coming up in April, and the mathematics in May.

588
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:33,653
So this gives us an opportunity to go over those exams with the teachers more fully, not that we haven't been doing practice tests all along,

589
00:39:34,262 --> 00:39:37,303
But also, as you know, we have the online requirement.

590
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:45,926
So all fourth graders, eighth graders, and the entire Andrews School, 6th, 7th, and 8th, are going to be taking the test online.

591
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:49,107
So there's a certain amount of additional prep for that.

592
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:50,868
So that's kind of our plan.

593
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:55,429
We have a lot of other little things going on that we've been working on today.

594
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:57,690
Diane, I don't know if you want to speak to anything else.

595
00:39:59,004 --> 00:39:59,184
Sure.

596
00:39:59,384 --> 00:40:02,725
One of the things that the teachers really wanted was choice.

597
00:40:02,845 --> 00:40:10,927
And so when we were going through the survey with the Professional Development Committee, there were the three topics that Beverly mentioned.

598
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:20,409
And at the elementary level, we had almost 100 teachers who really wanted to work the at-risk group, which is a considerable, significant amount.

599
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:21,969
But we made it work.

600
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:26,790
We had administrators who stepped up to the plate to work with our teacher presenters.

601
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:33,475
The second half of the day, our grades 3, 4, and 5 will be working on the MCAS 2.0.

602
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:37,197
But I'm very excited to talk about what the K1 and 2 will be doing.

603
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:40,038
As you know, they're not the test grades.

604
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:44,040
But we still wanted to have professional development for them that was worthwhile.

605
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:50,544
So you'll be happy to know we have Rocco Sieri doing science with our K1 and 2 teachers.

606
00:40:51,224 --> 00:40:53,466
Dr. Bernadette Rigodelli is here this evening.

607
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:56,107
She's going to be working on some social studies with our

608
00:40:56,517 --> 00:40:59,378
K1 and 2 teachers in a round-robin format.

609
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:17,688
And we're also going to do a workshop on what not to do in IEP meetings from a general education standpoint, and just in general, time constraints so you don't walk in with a cup of coffee and plop it down and chit-chat with your neighbor.

610
00:41:17,748 --> 00:41:23,051
So Mrs. Madaglio's daughter actually found this wonderful video on YouTube.

611
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:25,812
And Cheryl Maiocco and one of our

612
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:30,056
Teachers, Mariana Stewart, will be facilitating that workshop.

613
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:34,678
So we're very excited about what we're doing in professional development on March 13th.

614
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:37,039
Very good.

615
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:38,439
Ms.

616
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:39,039
Kretz.

617
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:50,945
I wanted to just mention, I got to attend part of the session on the November 8th professional development day, and the presenters were excellent.

618
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:54,206
I watched a very moving video.

619
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:57,554
And I sat in a group with some other teachers.

620
00:41:57,614 --> 00:42:00,535
We discussed strategies, techniques.

621
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:04,416
And we broke up into groups, and then everybody got to share their ideas.

622
00:42:04,516 --> 00:42:08,558
And it was really educational, and it was a good day.

623
00:42:08,718 --> 00:42:09,358
I had a great day.

624
00:42:10,638 --> 00:42:12,079
I wish you guys the best of luck on Monday.

625
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,639
Well, we really thank you.

626
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,140
The teachers have been incredible.

627
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,361
It shows you what you give someone some ownership of something, how they can run with it.

628
00:42:19,982 --> 00:42:24,063
And they've had some administrative support, but that was just initially.

629
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:29,861
But once they got going, it was pretty much on their own, and they have been wonderful.

630
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:36,826
And I hope, you know, our plan is to try to do a similar type of PD next year, too, because this worked very well.

631
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:38,687
We're waiting to see our evaluations.

632
00:42:38,707 --> 00:42:39,928
We're going to have evaluations.

633
00:42:40,749 --> 00:42:50,216
One of the questions on the evaluations, and this is really important for us, what did you learn this year in your PD that you can basically take back and implement in your classroom?

634
00:42:50,496 --> 00:42:51,637
Because that's what it's all about.

635
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:56,046
you know, learning good things, but also about implementing what you're learning.

636
00:42:56,506 --> 00:42:58,627
So we're going to get that feedback from the teachers.

637
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:02,708
Also, what would they like to learn more about related to the topic?

638
00:43:03,308 --> 00:43:08,869
And again, we'll plan accordingly for next year based on what we get from, from them and the evaluations.

639
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,750
Yes.

640
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,130
Thanks.

641
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,991
Um, for the MCAS 2.0, all students in grades four.

642
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,332
So all four elementary school kids will be doing it online.

643
00:43:18,652 --> 00:43:22,233
And then grade eight, both the Andrews and the McGlynn and everything's set to go.

644
00:43:22,877 --> 00:43:24,018
All the computers are up and ready?

645
00:43:24,158 --> 00:43:24,358
Oh, yes.

646
00:43:24,378 --> 00:43:25,699
We've been working on that.

647
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:26,280
OK.

648
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,200
We're making sure.

649
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:27,981
That's good to hear.

650
00:43:28,341 --> 00:43:33,145
The other thing, could you send us the video that you found about the IEP that you're showing?

651
00:43:33,165 --> 00:43:34,185
I can do that.

652
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:36,247
Would you mind waiting until after we show it?

653
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:36,867
That'd be great.

654
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:37,368
On March 13th.

655
00:43:37,588 --> 00:43:37,848
Yes.

656
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:38,969
But I'd be happy to do it.

657
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:39,429
Thank you.

658
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:40,290
I want to see it, too.

659
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,150
Yeah, that's great.

660
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:45,954
There's a motion to accept the report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto.

661
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:46,674
Is there a second?

662
00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:47,715
Second.

663
00:43:47,735 --> 00:43:47,835
By Ms.

664
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,115
Kretz.

665
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:49,276
All those in favor?

666
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:49,356
Aye.

667
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:50,737
All those opposed?

668
00:43:50,857 --> 00:43:51,498
Motion passes.

669
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,678
Pre-budget report guidance department.

670
00:43:55,998 --> 00:43:56,919
Mr. Superintendent.

671
00:43:57,499 --> 00:44:00,701
So we begin the process now of looking at pre-budget reports.

672
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:06,324
Tonight starts and we'll turn it over to our deputy superintendent to introduce this first report.

673
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:10,346
It's that time of year pre-budget reports are starting.

674
00:44:10,726 --> 00:44:17,030
Um, we will be scheduling them as we move forward with our meetings from this point on.

675
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:23,413
And, um, our guidance director, Amelia Jensen has been the brave soul to come forward for the first one.

676
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,201
tonight, but she always does a spectacular job.

677
00:44:26,701 --> 00:44:28,021
So we want to start with a star.

678
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:29,161
So Amelia.

679
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:30,781
Thank you.

680
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:35,062
Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the school committee.

681
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:43,804
Tonight you have all received the pre-budget report for the guidance department, but I'm going to give you a brief overview of it.

682
00:44:43,824 --> 00:44:47,065
So I won't go through all of it, but I'll just highlight some important points.

683
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:52,209
An overview of our department, this year our department consists of 10 guidance counselors.

684
00:44:52,249 --> 00:44:57,714
We have five at the high school, one at the vocational technical high school, and two at each middle school.

685
00:44:58,635 --> 00:45:08,504
The mission of the guidance department is to ensure that all students thrive in the three areas of academic development, college and career preparation, and social emotional wellness.

686
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:11,627
And that's really where our curriculum is focused.

687
00:45:12,267 --> 00:45:27,164
To deliver this curriculum, the middle school counselors teach guidance classes, and at the high school, counselors meet students in guidance seminars, which is through our advisory program, as well as individual meetings and large group pull-outs from classes and small groups.

688
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:34,472
So this last year, the school year 2016-2017, we spent all of our funding on office supplies.

689
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:47,842
We spent our money in our contractual services account for subscriptions and memberships, in addition to professional development in regards to English language learners and vocational technical education.

690
00:45:48,682 --> 00:45:52,305
Books were also purchased to support staff who are working with students.

691
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:57,855
And the PSAT subsidy was used to pay for all juniors to take the PSAT free of charge.

692
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:03,982
That was a huge success and I want to thank you all for providing that funding last year and this year.

693
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:08,786
And for major accomplishments, I wanted to highlight a few.

694
00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:13,287
The first is that we have a new program through the guidance department called NPower.

695
00:46:13,807 --> 00:46:25,411
And this is a guidance-initiated program that was established not this year, but last year, to really support students who are at risk for not graduating and those who had no plans for post-secondary education.

696
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:37,420
This program focuses on four areas of purpose, finding purpose, identity development, creating goals, and finding support and resources within the school.

697
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:47,405
And what we found with this program is that students who are enrolled in this program, or I mean participating in this program, actually have increased their GPA, are twice as likely to

698
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:52,008
sorry, increase their GPA at twice the rate of students not in this program.

699
00:46:52,368 --> 00:46:54,029
So we're finding great success with this.

700
00:46:54,049 --> 00:47:04,717
This is currently being implemented with our seniors, and it has got the attention of researchers at BC and Harvard, and so they are actually working with us this year to study the program.

701
00:47:05,237 --> 00:47:14,944
We're hoping to continue this program next year with our senior students, and possibly looking to expand it with our freshman and sophomore students, hopefully in the future.

702
00:47:16,685 --> 00:47:24,108
The department was also successfully trained in using school brains and implementing it in the scheduling and registration process.

703
00:47:24,568 --> 00:47:25,148
This was huge.

704
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:28,990
We went through hours and hours of training, and we feel that it was very successful.

705
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,892
And we're looking forward to a successful registration season this year as well.

706
00:47:35,656 --> 00:47:40,643
We also increased our partnerships and programs that improve post-secondary outcomes for our at-risk students.

707
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:45,932
And these are really programs that help bridge the transition from high school to beyond.

708
00:47:46,493 --> 00:47:50,058
These are programs that provide more meaning for students and are more supportive.

709
00:47:51,507 --> 00:47:55,349
And finally, we had a successful C3 day in college fair in October.

710
00:47:55,369 --> 00:48:06,174
So this was really a two-week span when all juniors were able to take the PSATs, all seniors were able to engage in college, career, or community service activities.

711
00:48:06,955 --> 00:48:15,539
This is really a time when our seniors can leave campus and they can go and do college visits, they can do job shadows, and they can also get their community service requirement done.

712
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,244
And then within that two-week span, we also had over 500 students attend the college fair.

713
00:48:21,764 --> 00:48:25,047
So that is a quick overview of some of our accomplishments for this year.

714
00:48:26,288 --> 00:48:31,413
So hopefully I didn't go over that too quickly, but I'd like to see if any of you have any questions.

715
00:48:33,154 --> 00:48:33,314
Ms.

716
00:48:33,354 --> 00:48:33,795
Vander Kloot?

717
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:37,799
Sure.

718
00:48:37,879 --> 00:48:40,720
So the Welcome Project is a program through Somerville.

719
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,401
And there's actually a lot of mini programs within that program.

720
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,602
And one of the programs that we have used is called LIPS.

721
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:58,644
And I'm sorry, I can't remember the acronym at this moment, but it's a program that comes in and it trains our students who speak English and another language to be interpreters.

722
00:48:58,784 --> 00:49:00,944
So a lot of our ELL students took advantage of that.

723
00:49:01,324 --> 00:49:04,225
They were trained in being an interpreter, and then they were set up with a job.

724
00:49:04,748 --> 00:49:05,249
That's great.

725
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:14,163
I was also, if I can follow up, I was wondering if you're seeing students who are concerned about their family's immigration status, if that's causing any angst.

726
00:49:15,304 --> 00:49:17,388
We are seeing a few of those students.

727
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:26,323
but for the most part, our ELL department has been working closely with the guidance department, um, and helping to support those students.

728
00:49:27,084 --> 00:49:34,267
Uh, we've been able to provide them resources and just information on their rights as students.

729
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:38,930
Um, but yeah, it is, it's difficult this year.

730
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:40,571
Thank you.

731
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:44,252
Mr. Scary.

732
00:49:45,353 --> 00:49:47,254
Uh, through, uh, through you to miss Jensen.

733
00:49:47,877 --> 00:49:54,658
I noticed that you have asked for an increase in counseling staff for social emotional needs in the elementary grades.

734
00:49:54,939 --> 00:49:56,139
How is it working out this year?

735
00:49:57,399 --> 00:49:59,780
In the, oh, you mean last year?

736
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,300
Last year.

737
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:09,322
Well, this currently, do you have enough staff to meet the needs of the elementary children that may need help or counseling or just a shoulder to lean on?

738
00:50:09,742 --> 00:50:11,102
Can we approve the program?

739
00:50:11,682 --> 00:50:15,443
We currently do not have any guidance counselors in the elementary schools.

740
00:50:16,123 --> 00:50:19,325
But we do have school adjustment counselors and school psychologists.

741
00:50:19,405 --> 00:50:22,506
And at this current moment, I believe they are meeting the needs.

742
00:50:22,846 --> 00:50:24,167
But I would have to defer that to Ms.

743
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,989
Modeglio, because I believe she might be talking about those services.

744
00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:28,369
OK.

745
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:31,170
Could you put together a small report and send it back to us, please?

746
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:31,590
Of course.

747
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:31,791
Yep.

748
00:50:32,131 --> 00:50:32,491
Thank you.

749
00:50:35,872 --> 00:50:36,713
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

750
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,154
Thank you.

751
00:50:38,774 --> 00:50:43,236
So you talked a little bit about school brains and how everybody was trained on school brains.

752
00:50:43,697 --> 00:50:45,799
And my question isn't directed at you.

753
00:50:45,819 --> 00:50:47,541
It's really to the superintendent.

754
00:50:48,422 --> 00:50:59,554
I got a note from a parent in the last few weeks about teachers not putting the grades of students into the system so that they could see them.

755
00:51:00,014 --> 00:51:05,080
So I directed the parent directly to Dr. Perala, who was handling that one situation.

756
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:17,593
But overall, could you please check to make sure that throughout the district and provide us with a report as to whether everybody's up and running and posting homework and grades on School Brains.

757
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:22,435
And if not, a timeline for everybody to be up and running.

758
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:30,739
I know we talked about this previously, but I'd like to know if there are any teachers in the district that are struggling that you need to help along this process.

759
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:33,240
And if so, how many there are and where they're located.

760
00:51:33,748 --> 00:51:37,650
So I'm requesting a report, um, make it a motion for a port at that time.

761
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:38,431
I need a second.

762
00:51:38,711 --> 00:51:39,951
So we had a meeting.

763
00:51:40,672 --> 00:51:41,552
God, I take the motion.

764
00:51:42,553 --> 00:51:42,853
Second.

765
00:51:43,153 --> 00:51:43,473
Second.

766
00:51:43,513 --> 00:51:46,995
So first, Mr. Benedetto second by Mr. Um, scary.

767
00:51:47,015 --> 00:51:48,116
Uh, all in favor.

768
00:51:48,436 --> 00:51:49,777
All opposed.

769
00:51:51,018 --> 00:51:51,678
Motion passes.

770
00:51:51,718 --> 00:51:56,381
So we had a meeting today on a number of issues, including certain elements of technology.

771
00:51:57,061 --> 00:52:00,443
And this came up and the feeling was, is that the teachers are making,

772
00:52:00,883 --> 00:52:04,608
very, very good progress in most instances using school brains to report out.

773
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:10,916
Nothing is 100%, I'm sure, but I'll try to get a better, more definitive report for you.

774
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:12,618
Thank you so much.

775
00:52:12,638 --> 00:52:19,667
I just want to follow up with if one parent calls and there's other parents that are feeling the same way, it just haven't made that call.

776
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,120
Okay.

777
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:29,062
I believe it's miss my stone first and then just, just to finish.

778
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:30,863
I just want to thank you and your department.

779
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:32,443
I know you run a lot of different things.

780
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:34,764
I know your staff has increased in the last few years.

781
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:38,225
Um, it sounds like there's more and more programming.

782
00:52:38,645 --> 00:52:48,289
How, um, how are you handling the merger with students with the vocational side as well as the high school side and children going back and forth?

783
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:48,749
I mean,

784
00:52:49,196 --> 00:52:52,377
Are we sharing some of those students or how are we looking at that?

785
00:52:52,457 --> 00:52:52,658
Yes.

786
00:52:52,678 --> 00:52:53,918
So that's a very good question.

787
00:52:54,298 --> 00:52:55,479
Um, moving forward.

788
00:52:55,499 --> 00:53:00,141
So starting next year we are looking at completely integrating the students with all the counselors.

789
00:53:00,881 --> 00:53:08,625
Um, up until now, um, students who have identified that they are attending the vocational school have been placed with the vocational school counselor.

790
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:13,827
Um, but the vocational school counselor and the high school counselors meet weekly.

791
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:15,307
They collaborate.

792
00:53:15,347 --> 00:53:19,749
The high school counselors are very much informed and trained in vocational education.

793
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:28,472
And the vocational school counselor has also been working on college applications and doing everything that a high school counselor does.

794
00:53:28,532 --> 00:53:30,833
So I think that they're very prepared for this merger.

795
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:33,834
And so next year, that's what we're looking to do.

796
00:53:33,854 --> 00:53:37,976
With the incoming ninth graders, it will be divided evenly among the counselors.

797
00:53:38,656 --> 00:53:40,557
It still has to get final approval, though.

798
00:53:41,314 --> 00:53:54,118
So at a high school level, including the Curtis Tufts and the vocational school and the high school, how many students does each guidance counselor counsel?

799
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,498
I'd have to get you an exact number.

800
00:53:56,538 --> 00:53:59,159
I don't have an exact number, but roughly about 300.

801
00:53:59,659 --> 00:54:03,360
So each guidance counselor is managing 300 students.

802
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:03,980
Correct.

803
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,741
That's a lot.

804
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:09,402
I mean, obviously, at the Curtis Tufts, it's a smaller caseload.

805
00:54:11,198 --> 00:54:12,738
But on average, 300.

806
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:14,859
OK.

807
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:21,540
That's good to know for future staffing levels, if there are increases or different needs.

808
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,161
What about ESL students?

809
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:31,342
Do they have a specific guidance counselor that might speak or help them in a different way?

810
00:54:31,462 --> 00:54:34,603
Or does the ESL teacher step in at that point?

811
00:54:34,643 --> 00:54:35,583
How is that managed?

812
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:41,098
So our EL students do not have a specific guidance counselor that would be an EL counselor.

813
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:51,087
However, they have specific support courses that we try and put them in, where one is actually called college and career preparation.

814
00:54:53,686 --> 00:54:56,188
And so I believe it's called College and Career Preparation.

815
00:54:56,428 --> 00:54:58,090
I can get you the exact name of the course.

816
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:58,790
That's OK.

817
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,673
And they also have summer programs that are available to these students as well.

818
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:09,318
So we do do extra outreach for these students, but they don't have a specific counselor for EL.

819
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:11,440
They do have their counselor, though.

820
00:55:12,508 --> 00:55:14,269
And they help them through the process.

821
00:55:14,289 --> 00:55:14,849
Correct, yes.

822
00:55:15,429 --> 00:55:16,930
And we did some training this year.

823
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:29,295
We actually did two trainings in working with the EL population, just providing our counselors resources to use for these students, background on different laws and legal regulations.

824
00:55:30,275 --> 00:55:31,916
So they are very knowledgeable in it.

825
00:55:32,556 --> 00:55:34,597
And my final question is about

826
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:44,205
the PSATs now that you've taken it two years, are you seeing an increase in scores on SATs because all students are taking that prep?

827
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:45,445
Yes, thank you for bringing that up.

828
00:55:45,505 --> 00:55:50,088
We are seeing an increase in scores of about 100 points on average.

829
00:55:50,128 --> 00:55:50,188
Wow.

830
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:50,849
So that's huge.

831
00:55:51,169 --> 00:55:51,969
Significant.

832
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:52,390
Yes.

833
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:57,513
And we're also seeing students signing up for the SATs sooner than they had in previous years.

834
00:55:58,173 --> 00:56:06,197
So the average student would sign up for the SATs either June of their junior year or October of their senior year.

835
00:56:06,437 --> 00:56:14,901
And now students are signing up in January and March of their junior year, which leads them to also end up taking an additional test and get higher scores.

836
00:56:15,642 --> 00:56:16,462
Well worth the money.

837
00:56:16,562 --> 00:56:16,722
Yes.

838
00:56:16,882 --> 00:56:17,723
It's good to hear that.

839
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:19,790
Ms.

840
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:20,271
Mustone.

841
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:20,871
Yeah, thanks.

842
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:23,193
Um, thank you for the report.

843
00:56:23,293 --> 00:56:28,058
The last bullet where it says middle school guidance assisted in the implementation of the umbrella project.

844
00:56:29,077 --> 00:56:30,338
I've not heard anything about it.

845
00:56:30,738 --> 00:56:33,639
What is the Umbrella Project's role at the middle school?

846
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:44,484
So the Umbrella Project is a program that is happening at the McGlynn Middle School, and it's being led by the guidance department and Ian Charles, the assistant principal there.

847
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:56,370
And it's really a support program to help identify students who are at risk, whether that's social, emotional, or behavioral, and putting them on plans that help support them throughout the year.

848
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:58,751
So kind of doing an early intervention with those students.

849
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:01,525
Do you know how many kids are enrolled in the Umbrella Project?

850
00:57:01,725 --> 00:57:07,047
I don't know how many are currently, but I know that last year there were about 25 that completed the program.

851
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:09,929
Are there plans for it to go to the Andrews?

852
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:11,930
I'm not sure about that.

853
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:19,273
I know when Ian Charles came in, he was a driving force with this program.

854
00:57:20,643 --> 00:57:33,071
And the counselors jumped on board and really did all of the support work for it, because they provided the extra space for the students to do the work, to do their homework, to be pulled from their exploratory courses.

855
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:36,173
So I'm not sure if it's going to be going to the Andrews.

856
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:36,833
I haven't heard.

857
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:41,196
We could look into that, though, because I know that they're moving in.

858
00:57:42,365 --> 00:57:45,247
The question is whether or not it could be moved to the Andrews.

859
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,127
To the Andrews.

860
00:57:46,608 --> 00:57:48,749
Well, I think any program can be moved.

861
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:54,312
And really, principals have to weigh in as to whether they believe it would be effective for them or whether they want to do something else.

862
00:57:55,253 --> 00:57:58,475
So the Andrews uses things like Study Island and other things like that.

863
00:57:58,495 --> 00:58:04,979
So we want to give principals some degree of autonomy to make decisions that they believe are in the best interest.

864
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:10,322
It could very well be that they adopt something from another school that they believe would work for them, too.

865
00:58:10,852 --> 00:58:11,632
So we'll check into it.

866
00:58:11,652 --> 00:58:12,132
We'll get back.

867
00:58:12,413 --> 00:58:12,833
Okay.

868
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,073
I'll set me up.

869
00:58:15,574 --> 00:58:15,754
Yeah.

870
00:58:15,794 --> 00:58:16,134
Thank you.

871
00:58:16,154 --> 00:58:16,574
Thank you.

872
00:58:17,234 --> 00:58:17,834
Mr. Scary.

873
00:58:17,854 --> 00:58:36,380
I made it through to the superintendent, uh, including this report was, uh, the fact that they have one computer that's not working as long as we get in touch with Mr. Trotter, see if we can get that replaced and also try to get a new computer for the secretary sooner rather than later to help the office run efficiently.

874
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:49,281
Let me check on it to make sure that I understand what really isn't working or what is slower than might be desired or, you know, an upgrade or whatever the case may be, but we'll certainly give you a report back.

875
00:58:49,681 --> 00:58:49,961
Okay.

876
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:57,225
Because I think we, we owe it to our staff to make sure that they have equipment that works every day, every time that they want to use it.

877
00:58:57,285 --> 00:59:01,528
And it benefits not only the guidance department, but the students.

878
00:59:01,928 --> 00:59:02,128
Right.

879
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:03,789
Thank you.

880
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:04,910
Ms.

881
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:05,130
Kratz.

882
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,120
Oh, hi.

883
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:06,780
Thank you, Ms.

884
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,301
Jensen.

885
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:10,042
The poll was great.

886
00:59:10,982 --> 00:59:23,246
I wanted to mention one of the goals for this upcoming year, which is the online program to assist students' graduation rate, offering enrichment courses and the alternate programs.

887
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:29,528
I wanted to know now, the information, I think it might be out now, is it online?

888
00:59:29,568 --> 00:59:33,650
Do the students, was a message sent out so the students know?

889
00:59:34,243 --> 00:59:44,211
they can take advantage of it, or is it more of the guidance department might approach a student or parent and let them know they think they might be a good fit for something like that?

890
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:49,014
So currently, right now, the district is piloting the Ingenuity PLATO program.

891
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:55,419
And so we're using it with our juniors and seniors, not yet with our freshmen and sophomores.

892
00:59:58,081 --> 01:00:12,111
any student who is looking to make up a course, whether that's going to be in summer school or in the past they had come to the guidance office and asked to make up a course and we had referred them to Somerville online school or we had referred them to BYU online school.

893
01:00:12,491 --> 01:00:14,873
Now we will be referring them obviously to our school.

894
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:17,222
They can be taking this course with us.

895
01:00:18,662 --> 01:00:30,007
So we haven't yet, this isn't something that we have put out to the public yet, but when students come to us or when the guidance counselors approach the students about needing a credit recovery course, this is the option that's given to them.

896
01:00:31,368 --> 01:00:37,870
And we're looking to also expand this program for students to take quarterly enrichment courses, so not just credit recovery.

897
01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:41,952
So that's something that we're continuing to grow this year.

898
01:00:42,852 --> 01:00:44,573
Is there a cost associated with it?

899
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:55,845
The cost is $125 for the course, which is cheaper than the other online options that they were given in the past.

900
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:57,986
And how long is the course?

901
01:00:58,846 --> 01:01:00,707
Is it a six-week course?

902
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:02,267
Is it a three-week course?

903
01:01:02,547 --> 01:01:03,588
I was just a little curious.

904
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,290
So the courses are self-paced.

905
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,291
The students can finish them as quickly as they would like.

906
01:01:09,072 --> 01:01:11,232
And it is all dependent on the course.

907
01:01:11,372 --> 01:01:20,435
I know over summer school, Mr. Ciari had used this online program, I believe, for biology.

908
01:01:21,433 --> 01:01:22,234
I think it was biology.

909
01:01:22,714 --> 01:01:26,056
And he had gone into the biology course.

910
01:01:26,076 --> 01:01:33,722
And the great thing about this program is that the teachers can go in, and they can look at the standards that the course is teaching, and they can take them out.

911
01:01:33,882 --> 01:01:35,043
They can put in their own standards.

912
01:01:35,063 --> 01:01:40,447
So they can really modify the course for what they believe the need is for the student or for the class that's being offered.

913
01:01:41,668 --> 01:01:44,330
And so this summer, that course was offered for six weeks.

914
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:49,410
But the benefit of it is that if students didn't finish within the six weeks, they had until the end of the summer to take it.

915
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:52,491
So we're looking at that moving forward.

916
01:01:52,572 --> 01:02:01,716
I know Dr. Perla and the central administration has been working with the directors to have them go through and look at some of these courses and modify some of these courses.

917
01:02:01,816 --> 01:02:04,917
They were just trained, I believe, it was in January.

918
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:06,918
Thank you.

919
01:02:06,978 --> 01:02:07,398
Thank you.

920
01:02:07,418 --> 01:02:08,019
Sounds exciting.

921
01:02:08,059 --> 01:02:08,319
Thanks.

922
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:08,859
Thank you.

923
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:09,873
Ms.

924
01:02:09,913 --> 01:02:10,273
Cuneo.

925
01:02:10,854 --> 01:02:11,314
Thank you.

926
01:02:11,935 --> 01:02:12,935
And thank you, Ms.

927
01:02:12,975 --> 01:02:14,717
Jensen, for the report.

928
01:02:14,777 --> 01:02:17,859
It is very particular and a lot of details.

929
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:21,321
I'm looking at the coffee with the counselors.

930
01:02:21,461 --> 01:02:21,622
Yes.

931
01:02:22,082 --> 01:02:23,443
How did you promote that?

932
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:27,986
Was it just by being online or was there a robocall made out to parents?

933
01:02:28,647 --> 01:02:31,769
What time was it scheduled and is it individual?

934
01:02:32,229 --> 01:02:35,231
Yeah, so the history of the coffee with the, well, I can give you a brief overview.

935
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,794
So the coffee with the counselors is something that we're doing this year based on

936
01:02:39,895 --> 01:02:41,436
parent requests from previous years.

937
01:02:41,476 --> 01:02:48,521
They said there are so many night events, there were so many games or sporting events that they had to go to, that they really would like a time to come to the school during the day.

938
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:53,725
And we realized that this isn't necessarily ideal for all parents, but we wanted to provide this opportunity for some of them.

939
01:02:54,225 --> 01:02:59,209
So we're doing this quarterly, and each quarter there's a different topic.

940
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:04,853
The counselors are giving a mini presentation, about 15 minutes, going over some current information.

941
01:03:05,814 --> 01:03:07,095
And then it's also a time for

942
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,877
the counselors to break out into groups with their parents.

943
01:03:09,917 --> 01:03:14,620
And the parents can talk to one another, they can talk to the counselors, they can get grade-specific information.

944
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,101
So, so far, it's been pretty popular.

945
01:03:17,141 --> 01:03:18,122
We've had a good turnout.

946
01:03:18,442 --> 01:03:26,007
And the way that we've advertised it is through the blog, through Lisa Evangelista posting, the website, and then we've also done a robocall home.

947
01:03:26,968 --> 01:03:27,588
That sounds great.

948
01:03:27,608 --> 01:03:36,054
The other thing I was going to ask is, it says you've connected over 75 percent of at-risk seniors, which means

949
01:03:36,662 --> 01:03:45,429
It's 2.5 GPA or lower, so I don't want people thinking that it's a 1.5 or anything like that.

950
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:49,071
But I'm just wondering, how did you connect and what is the plan?

951
01:03:51,262 --> 01:03:57,986
So we've really utilized our counselor who's in charge of school and community partnerships.

952
01:03:58,586 --> 01:04:09,912
And what he does is he really looks at programs that have a proven successful track record and ones that will meet the most needs of our students.

953
01:04:09,952 --> 01:04:13,234
And he's been able to bring in a lot of outside programs, which are some of them that I've listed.

954
01:04:14,294 --> 01:04:23,359
During the day there will be many assemblies or many meetings, whether it's during lunch or during a class, where these students can come down and learn about these programs and sign up for them.

955
01:04:23,379 --> 01:04:25,661
Okay.

956
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:27,962
And I see that you've had the second C3 day.

957
01:04:28,342 --> 01:04:28,542
Yes.

958
01:04:28,822 --> 01:04:29,603
And how did that go?

959
01:04:29,663 --> 01:04:35,826
Did you have students that really took advantage of going off to different colleges or did they stay?

960
01:04:35,926 --> 01:04:36,146
Yep.

961
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:39,788
So the majority of our students ended up going and visiting a school.

962
01:04:39,868 --> 01:04:42,870
So in order to get the excused absence, they have to bring proof back that they

963
01:04:43,484 --> 01:04:44,865
did one of those activities.

964
01:04:46,026 --> 01:04:48,028
And the majority of them do visit a college.

965
01:04:48,869 --> 01:04:53,033
But we did have some students who did other activities as well, like a job shadow.

966
01:04:53,113 --> 01:04:54,615
Some of them did community service.

967
01:04:55,576 --> 01:05:00,981
And then we also had an admissions officer from Tufts come to campus and give an essay writing workshop.

968
01:05:04,288 --> 01:05:27,199
I know that my colleague asked the counselors at the high school have about 300 students apiece correct correct and We are still doing it that it's not we're doing it with alphabet in alphabetical order So that way not everyone has there's no there's no longer a class of 300 of seniors, correct Okay, and so with that being said how many seniors does each counselor have do you know?

969
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,201
depending on the year anywhere between 60 to 90

970
01:05:33,574 --> 01:05:33,975
60 to 90.

971
01:05:36,076 --> 01:05:36,877
Thank you so much.

972
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:42,082
Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place this report on file?

973
01:05:43,163 --> 01:05:45,264
So moved by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

974
01:05:45,304 --> 01:05:45,885
Van de Kloot.

975
01:05:46,085 --> 01:05:46,826
All those in favor?

976
01:05:46,846 --> 01:05:47,366
Aye.

977
01:05:47,486 --> 01:05:48,247
All those opposed?

978
01:05:48,427 --> 01:05:49,088
Motion passes.

979
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:51,369
Thank you.

980
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,730
Also, I'm sorry, can I mention one more thing?

981
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,830
Sure.

982
01:05:53,850 --> 01:06:00,053
We did have our eighth grade course selection night last week, so this is something separate other than the guidance board.

983
01:06:00,673 --> 01:06:02,674
And this was last Tuesday.

984
01:06:02,694 --> 01:06:04,055
It was the eighth grade course selection night.

985
01:06:04,115 --> 01:06:05,895
All of the eighth graders came to the high school.

986
01:06:06,175 --> 01:06:07,876
We had a huge turnout.

987
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:09,557
The entire Caron Theater was filled.

988
01:06:09,657 --> 01:06:15,719
Parents got to listen to Dr. Prella and Dr. Riccio give presentations

989
01:06:18,068 --> 01:06:21,491
the integrating of the two schools and where are schools going in the future.

990
01:06:22,772 --> 01:06:26,575
They also got to hear about the registration and scheduling process of the high school.

991
01:06:26,955 --> 01:06:36,724
And I wanted to let you know that we received very positive feedback from parents on the integration of the two schools and the additional opportunities that this is going to be affording students.

992
01:06:36,864 --> 01:06:39,226
So they really like to hear that students could graduate

993
01:06:41,027 --> 01:06:49,495
with a certificate program from the vocational school, that they could also graduate with dual enrollment credits, and those same students could graduate with AP credits.

994
01:06:49,955 --> 01:06:51,537
So they were very, very excited about that.

995
01:06:52,298 --> 01:07:00,605
They also liked the simplicity in the scheduling process that we're pushing for for this year, which includes a limited option of electives for freshmen.

996
01:07:01,246 --> 01:07:04,629
So our freshmen are going to be offered the CTE Exploratory,

997
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:21,166
an art course or a music course, which will be band, orchestra, or chorus, and we're limiting that for freshmen because we really feel that in order to explore and in order to have a freshman year that is not as overwhelming, it would be better to limit those courses.

998
01:07:21,966 --> 01:07:28,188
So we're hoping for a big turnout in the CTE Exploratory, which would allow students to explore 20 different careers.

999
01:07:29,035 --> 01:07:29,455
Very good.

1000
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:30,155
Thank you.

1001
01:07:30,535 --> 01:07:30,675
Ms.

1002
01:07:30,715 --> 01:07:31,496
Cuno, follow-up?

1003
01:07:31,896 --> 01:07:32,676
Yes, please.

1004
01:07:32,756 --> 01:07:33,696
A follow-up to that.

1005
01:07:33,776 --> 01:07:41,318
So if we're going to limit our freshmen, then what happens with our other classes as far as the electives?

1006
01:07:41,338 --> 01:07:47,400
Are they still going to have a good amount of students in them, or are we going to have electives that we only have a couple of students in them?

1007
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,341
Well, we will be having.

1008
01:07:49,681 --> 01:07:54,822
So all the freshmen will be in some sort of elective, whether it's music, art, or a CT exploratory.

1009
01:07:55,422 --> 01:07:58,143
And then the other electives, we are assuming that a few are

1010
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:03,343
Fewer students will be in them, but we're still offering all of our electives.

1011
01:08:03,423 --> 01:08:07,727
We're just going to be offering them alternating years, some of them on alternating years.

1012
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:13,973
And then when we ran the numbers, it doesn't look like the classes will be 15.

1013
01:08:14,093 --> 01:08:15,414
They will be more like 20 instead of 25, 26, 27.

1014
01:08:17,596 --> 01:08:18,997
How many electives do we have in all?

1015
01:08:19,998 --> 01:08:21,259
I think almost 70.

1016
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,002
And how many are we going to limit to the freshmen?

1017
01:08:25,023 --> 01:08:25,123
Is it 20?

1018
01:08:26,012 --> 01:08:33,778
So the freshmen have a choice of five different electives, but if they take the CTE Exploratory, they explore 20 different career technical programs.

1019
01:08:35,099 --> 01:08:36,180
Okay, thank you.

1020
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,881
You're welcome.

1021
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:37,981
Ms.

1022
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:38,522
Van de Kloot.

1023
01:08:39,342 --> 01:08:41,204
I'm not quite sure what you said in that.

1024
01:08:41,544 --> 01:08:48,890
So a freshman can't take art and band together?

1025
01:08:49,966 --> 01:08:55,252
So in past years, they've never been able to take art and band together because art is four credits and band is four credits.

1026
01:08:55,313 --> 01:08:56,274
They would have to choose.

1027
01:08:56,434 --> 01:08:58,136
So that's pretty much the same.

1028
01:08:58,596 --> 01:09:04,383
The only thing that's changing is we have a lot of mini courses, a lot of two-credit courses.

1029
01:09:04,603 --> 01:09:07,947
So when freshmen came in, if they took a two-credit course, they'd have to take

1030
01:09:08,267 --> 01:09:11,748
two of the two credit courses, and it was just a lot of courses for them to balance.

1031
01:09:12,268 --> 01:09:17,189
So we've really limited the courses that we're offering to the freshmen, and each one of them is gonna be four credits.

1032
01:09:17,669 --> 01:09:21,150
So they won't be bouncing around from elective to elective to elective their freshman year.

1033
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,810
They'll have one elective.

1034
01:09:26,091 --> 01:09:31,112
But they still have all of those opportunities for them sophomore, junior, and senior year.

1035
01:09:34,032 --> 01:09:36,553
So it didn't close off on any pathways for students.

1036
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:44,361
So is that for the whole school year, they would just have one elective?

1037
01:09:44,561 --> 01:09:45,342
Yep.

1038
01:09:45,702 --> 01:09:49,885
So if one of the electives was guitar, they would take guitar for the whole school year?

1039
01:09:50,245 --> 01:09:50,585
Correct.

1040
01:09:50,646 --> 01:09:54,468
And that's how all of our courses right now and all of our electives do run for the full year.

1041
01:09:54,908 --> 01:10:00,152
It's just they would meet two times over a six-day cycle instead of four times over a six-day cycle.

1042
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:04,255
And the pro of this is, I mean, the advantage?

1043
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:08,735
The advantage of this is that students are not balancing eight and nine courses.

1044
01:10:08,795 --> 01:10:11,979
They're only balancing six to seven courses.

1045
01:10:13,061 --> 01:10:13,541
Okay.

1046
01:10:13,561 --> 01:10:21,672
So just, you know, the opposite of that is I got into an elective and I don't really like that one, but I love the other one I'm taking.

1047
01:10:23,718 --> 01:10:25,099
So there's pros and cons.

1048
01:10:25,339 --> 01:10:25,780
Yes.

1049
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:33,907
Many of the other electives were very academic heavy, which was very overwhelming for freshmen who were getting used to the high school setting.

1050
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:40,112
So we really wanted to find something that got them more hands-on experience, something that was a little bit of a break from the day.

1051
01:10:40,952 --> 01:10:44,175
And the CTE exploratory class gave that to them.

1052
01:10:44,275 --> 01:10:47,137
And they also rotate through 20 different technical programs.

1053
01:10:47,758 --> 01:10:52,322
So if they don't like their current technical program, they wait a week and they get to change.

1054
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:58,524
Will they get graded in that CTE exploration?

1055
01:10:58,844 --> 01:10:59,585
Yes, they're all graded.

1056
01:10:59,605 --> 01:10:59,785
Okay.

1057
01:11:01,706 --> 01:11:01,987
Thank you.

1058
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,288
You're welcome.

1059
01:11:03,328 --> 01:11:03,908
Mr. Benedetto.

1060
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:17,538
I remember when my children were picking and when they loved art and music and they couldn't do both and at that point they had to decide whether to do each.

1061
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:22,062
My concern is that with the opportunity to explore

1062
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:30,035
so many different shops that they could take, that it could hurt our band and our orchestra.

1063
01:11:32,396 --> 01:11:48,925
So we just wanna be careful of that and make sure, I know personally that the evening orchestra would still accept students if they were taking band during the day and vice versa, but I'm not sure

1064
01:11:49,975 --> 01:11:51,936
how that's going to affect those groups.

1065
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:56,938
So could we be careful and mindful of that when sign-ups come?

1066
01:11:57,339 --> 01:12:07,003
We're also allowing students to take CTE Exploratory their sophomore year if, for some reason, they missed it their freshman year and would like to take it.

1067
01:12:07,163 --> 01:12:10,945
So that would open up the possibility for students who want to stay in music all four years.

1068
01:12:10,965 --> 01:12:11,846
OK.

1069
01:12:11,866 --> 01:12:12,166
All right.

1070
01:12:13,486 --> 01:12:13,847
Thank you.

1071
01:12:14,027 --> 01:12:14,627
Thank you.

1072
01:12:15,427 --> 01:12:16,168
Thank you very much.

1073
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:17,292
Ms.

1074
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:17,532
Cuno.

1075
01:12:17,572 --> 01:12:31,114
How does the technical side work into this schedule as far as when you have students coming in their freshman year, they have that opportunity to go over to the technical side to explore?

1076
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:33,555
So how do you work that into the CTE?

1077
01:12:35,595 --> 01:12:37,015
I'm sorry, I don't quite understand the question.

1078
01:12:37,035 --> 01:12:39,936
So you know how students are going to have their choice of taking an elective?

1079
01:12:40,536 --> 01:12:40,716
Yes.

1080
01:12:40,996 --> 01:12:41,616
OK.

1081
01:12:41,796 --> 01:12:45,957
But we're also giving them the opportunity to go over to the technical side and maybe

1082
01:12:46,483 --> 01:12:47,364
explore over there.

1083
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:52,467
So is that incorporated into those 20 or the five that you mentioned?

1084
01:12:52,847 --> 01:12:57,750
So the entire freshman class is not divided by vocational school, high school.

1085
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:00,352
It's going to be one group of students.

1086
01:13:01,332 --> 01:13:08,697
And no matter which, if a student has the plan of eventually going into the vocational school, they can take the CTE exploratory.

1087
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:15,161
If they don't have any plans to go into the vocational school, or they don't have an interest in that, they can take some of the other electives.

1088
01:13:15,821 --> 01:13:24,804
But even if they don't take the vocational exploratory, which is the 20 rotating programs, even if they don't take that, they can still opt to apply for the vocational school the 10th grade year.

1089
01:13:25,558 --> 01:13:31,979
All right, that's what I needed the clarification on, because I think that's the confusing part of there's so many balls being juggled.

1090
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:34,720
I didn't think we were going to be able to do that.

1091
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:36,960
So this is now at least a clarification.

1092
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:39,501
And thank you.

1093
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:41,001
I won't do any more follow-ups.

1094
01:13:41,021 --> 01:13:41,561
Thank you very much, Ms.

1095
01:13:41,581 --> 01:13:41,921
Jensen.

1096
01:13:41,941 --> 01:13:43,321
We appreciate your being here.

1097
01:13:44,121 --> 01:13:44,461
Thank you.

1098
01:13:45,002 --> 01:13:45,442
Thank you.

1099
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:47,302
You voted on that, correct?

1100
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:47,842
Yes.

1101
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:47,922
Ms.

1102
01:13:47,962 --> 01:13:48,622
Vanderbilt, yes.

1103
01:13:49,942 --> 01:13:51,823
Report on transgender student rights.

1104
01:13:51,883 --> 01:13:52,903
Mr. Superintendent.

1105
01:13:53,755 --> 01:13:55,697
Mayor, members of the school committee.

1106
01:13:56,858 --> 01:14:12,990
You know, on February 22nd, 2017, the federal government, using an executive order from the president, rescinded guidance and determined that Title IX's prohibition on gender identity discrimination was null and void.

1107
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:20,917
The president took the position that the protection of transgender rights should be left to each state.

1108
01:14:22,603 --> 01:14:27,707
Massachusetts law already protects the rights of transgender students in schools.

1109
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:33,011
Chapter 199 of the Acts of 2011 went into effect in July 2012.

1110
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:40,737
The Medford School Committee approved a local policy affirming the Massachusetts law on April 11, 2016.

1111
01:14:41,297 --> 01:14:44,419
We had taken a previous position on the 13th in 2013, but we updated in 2016.

1112
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:46,401
In your packet, you have information from

1113
01:14:52,908 --> 01:14:56,849
Mike Long, who is the legal counsel to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

1114
01:14:57,649 --> 01:15:00,790
You have guidance from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

1115
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:06,432
You have your own policy, the Medford Public Schools policy that was adopted in 2016.

1116
01:15:07,752 --> 01:15:14,474
You have some guidance from the MTA, the Largest Teachers Union, and you have a copy of the bills that were enacted.

1117
01:15:16,494 --> 01:15:19,155
Clearly, in Medford,

1118
01:15:20,192 --> 01:15:25,576
And clearly, throughout Massachusetts, transgender rights are protected.

1119
01:15:27,317 --> 01:15:32,280
Sometimes federal laws supersede, but not in this instance.

1120
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:38,145
Because in this instance, the executive order said, let the states decide.

1121
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:41,067
In this instance, the state has decided.

1122
01:15:41,867 --> 01:15:43,909
And we have an active plan in place.

1123
01:15:44,669 --> 01:15:48,572
And at this point, we have really no problems with what we've done.

1124
01:15:49,313 --> 01:15:50,813
and what we're doing in our schools.

1125
01:15:51,293 --> 01:15:52,974
So I want to bring you up to date on that.

1126
01:15:54,374 --> 01:16:09,857
I would like to, if I can, Mayor, also comment on the immigration rules, because I believe that's also tied to equal access to education, which is part of the same vein of thinking as the transgender rule.

1127
01:16:12,138 --> 01:16:16,659
I've given you an advisory from Mara Healy, the Massachusetts Attorney General,

1128
01:16:17,238 --> 01:16:22,579
on equal access to public education for all students, irrespective of immigration status.

1129
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:38,483
In Massachusetts, the Supreme Court of the United States recognized Brown versus Board of Education, and it is true today as it was back in 1953.

1130
01:16:38,943 --> 01:16:45,905
The advisory that the Attorney General has provided you is very, very clear.

1131
01:16:46,926 --> 01:17:08,459
There has been a case in Massachusetts, Filer v. Doe, in 1982, where the Supreme Court held that public elementary and secondary schools may not deny any child residing in the applicable jurisdiction access to public education, whether the child is present in the country legally or not.

1132
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:15,444
Filer made it clear that a child's immigration or citizenship status, or that his or her parents

1133
01:17:16,008 --> 01:17:20,149
Our guardian is not relevant to the child's right to a public education.

1134
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:35,252
So irrespective of any rulings that come down, Massachusetts law, states rights, made the decision that we will accept anyone who resides in our community.

1135
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:39,173
We will not ask them what their status is, visa or otherwise.

1136
01:17:39,853 --> 01:17:45,014
We will not pursue anything other than the fact they are not living in the community.

1137
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,851
If they're not living in the community, it's a residence issue.

1138
01:17:48,491 --> 01:18:00,335
But if they're living in the community, whether they're living with their parents or they're residing with some other responsible adult, we will provide them free and public access to our educational system.

1139
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:06,577
So I want to clarify that I am not allowed to ask what a person's visa status is.

1140
01:18:06,997 --> 01:18:09,398
I'm not allowed to ask what their immigrant status is.

1141
01:18:09,798 --> 01:18:11,678
I'm not allowed to ask for some of these things.

1142
01:18:12,879 --> 01:18:13,399
And in fact,

1143
01:18:14,075 --> 01:18:19,657
In some instances, there are people that are homeless, and I might have to accept that just simply based on homelessness.

1144
01:18:20,418 --> 01:18:24,640
We just had a webinar today on homelessness that dealt with foster children.

1145
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,120
More guidance is coming out on that.

1146
01:18:27,061 --> 01:18:34,384
So I want to make it clear that we're an equal opportunity school system, whether it's transgender or immigrant status.

1147
01:18:34,924 --> 01:18:43,388
If a youngster resides in our community, they are entitled to free access to our public education system, and that's the way we will treat them.

1148
01:18:44,092 --> 01:18:45,193
Happy to take any questions.

1149
01:18:46,134 --> 01:18:47,395
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1150
01:18:50,557 --> 01:18:52,979
Motion to receive the report, place it on file.

1151
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:53,980
Seconded by Ms.

1152
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,280
Kretz.

1153
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:55,341
All those in favor?

1154
01:18:55,361 --> 01:18:57,083
All those opposed?

1155
01:18:57,563 --> 01:18:59,104
Both reports are placed on file.

1156
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:05,210
Report on compliance with state defibrillation law.

1157
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:12,936
So effective July 1, 2018, all schools must have automated external defibrillators on site.

1158
01:19:13,465 --> 01:19:16,087
The good news is we have them in every one of our schools.

1159
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:31,716
An automated defibrillator, or an AED, is a medical device that will analyze heart rhythms and can deliver electric shocks to help a heart reestablish an effective rhythm during a sudden cardiac arrest.

1160
01:19:32,697 --> 01:19:38,900
The American Red Cross recommends that AEDs be readily available and applied within four minutes of cardiac arrest.

1161
01:19:40,421 --> 01:19:41,562
Now, under this law,

1162
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,061
We have to have trained people on staff.

1163
01:19:44,261 --> 01:19:44,601
We do.

1164
01:19:44,941 --> 01:19:51,043
We have nurses, we've trained our coaches, and we'll train even more people to use these items.

1165
01:19:51,963 --> 01:19:56,105
Tonight, we will have a moment of silence from somebody who could have used one.

1166
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:02,067
Obviously, this is important.

1167
01:20:02,527 --> 01:20:04,428
It's good to know that we're ahead of the curve.

1168
01:20:04,708 --> 01:20:05,869
We have them in every school.

1169
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:09,590
We'll review them to see whether or not we should be adding.

1170
01:20:10,256 --> 01:20:16,320
We have had good fortune working with our ambulance providers and others who have donated equipment to us.

1171
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:20,603
They get checked every day for battery effectiveness.

1172
01:20:20,683 --> 01:20:26,287
And we have to keep that up because you never know when the equipment's there, but the battery doesn't operate.

1173
01:20:26,307 --> 01:20:30,510
So you have to check this on a regular basis and we have to continuously train people.

1174
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:38,555
So I want to make sure you're aware that we're in compliance with this law well in advance of its implementation, but there's obviously more work that we will do.

1175
01:20:39,247 --> 01:20:43,589
to make this a more efficient and effective, uh, system for utilization.

1176
01:20:43,609 --> 01:20:44,449
Should it be necessary?

1177
01:20:44,809 --> 01:20:45,189
Thank you.

1178
01:20:46,269 --> 01:20:47,430
Um, Mr. Benedetto and then miss.

1179
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:49,330
Um, thank you.

1180
01:20:49,831 --> 01:20:51,211
So I have a few questions.

1181
01:20:51,491 --> 01:20:56,153
Uh, I, I really believe that these should be up at near our fields and somehow some way.

1182
01:20:56,173 --> 01:21:00,134
So people don't have to run back and try to get into the building to get them.

1183
01:21:00,614 --> 01:21:03,635
I don't know how, what an appropriate trainer will bring them to the field.

1184
01:21:03,715 --> 01:21:05,936
It will be brought by coaches and trainers.

1185
01:21:05,976 --> 01:21:07,537
We'll have them available on the fields.

1186
01:21:08,037 --> 01:21:08,257
Okay.

1187
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:15,527
And also a list near every defibrillator, who is trained, like a list of people trained to use it.

1188
01:21:15,988 --> 01:21:19,810
So that way, if it's a need, they know who to immediately go to.

1189
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:33,458
Because we, and I also would like a list of all school employees of who has been trained, how many people, where they are located, where they're working.

1190
01:21:33,498 --> 01:21:35,880
This is an important thing that could save people's lives.

1191
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:37,081
And I think that,

1192
01:21:38,007 --> 01:21:40,748
We need more information than what's provided.

1193
01:21:40,768 --> 01:21:45,609
I think it's important to recognize that I don't want people who are afraid to use this thing to use it.

1194
01:21:46,089 --> 01:21:46,949
Right, well then we need a list.

1195
01:21:46,989 --> 01:21:49,549
I want people only who are comfortable using it to use it.

1196
01:21:49,569 --> 01:21:51,750
There are some people who- Who are certified.

1197
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:52,810
Yeah, and certified.

1198
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:57,291
There are some people who would be very uncomfortable taking this device off the wall and using it.

1199
01:21:57,311 --> 01:21:59,071
So I'm making a motion right now.

1200
01:21:59,091 --> 01:22:03,392
Every building will have people, and we can provide you with a list of who's trying to use it.

1201
01:22:03,412 --> 01:22:06,173
I'm making a motion right now

1202
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:17,177
hopefully second by one of my colleagues, to have a list of all people certified and trained in using this and having it posted next to the defibrillators.

1203
01:22:17,257 --> 01:22:22,219
So when an emergency happens, they have the defibrillator and they're like, okay, who knows how to use this?

1204
01:22:22,559 --> 01:22:28,541
There's a list of people right then and there and they say, oh, he's on the other side of the field, go get Joe.

1205
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:31,822
And you're not going to the wrong direction to get somebody.

1206
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:33,851
So I think it's imperative.

1207
01:22:33,931 --> 01:22:36,712
So I've made the motion, seconded by my colleague.

1208
01:22:38,452 --> 01:22:39,453
Roll call vote, please.

1209
01:22:39,473 --> 01:22:40,113
Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

1210
01:22:40,673 --> 01:22:40,833
Ms.

1211
01:22:40,853 --> 01:22:42,454
Vandekloot, still speaking on this topic?

1212
01:22:42,754 --> 01:22:46,755
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that we have enough people in the schools.

1213
01:22:46,815 --> 01:22:48,136
I know you're saying you're working on it.

1214
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:55,639
I was thinking about a meeting I attended recently down at one of the middle schools, and at that point, there was no school nurse present.

1215
01:22:55,719 --> 01:23:00,080
There was, in fact, maybe the only person present might have been a principal.

1216
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:19,503
So that if I was a parent attending, or for that matter, a school committee member attending with a history of heart disease in the family, you know, just make sure that it would be great if we could really encourage as many people as possible to learn how to do this.

1217
01:23:19,523 --> 01:23:27,705
I just want to be careful that we have sufficient numbers, but that we don't put people in situations of doing things they're uncomfortable doing.

1218
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:29,165
It's very different than an EpiPen.

1219
01:23:30,096 --> 01:23:32,697
A lot of people can use an EpiPen very effectively.

1220
01:23:32,777 --> 01:23:37,138
Mr. Superintendent didn't say anything about forcing people to do it who didn't want to do it.

1221
01:23:37,538 --> 01:23:40,979
I'm thinking that there are people who, in fact, would like to learn how to do it.

1222
01:23:40,999 --> 01:23:41,619
I understand what you're saying.

1223
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:47,100
I just want to make it clear that this isn't one of those things like CPR that everyone is going to be trained in.

1224
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:54,942
It's something that you really want to make sure that the four or five people in the building who are the go-to people are the people that are really comfortable using a device like this.

1225
01:23:56,282 --> 01:23:58,483
This is a very sophisticated device.

1226
01:24:00,782 --> 01:24:17,511
Miss, miss, you all set this band clue, miss, miss John, the nurses.

1227
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:19,332
I don't know that, but I will check that.

1228
01:24:19,853 --> 01:24:27,277
I don't know that, but I'm told by Tony Vento that they check them every day and that's their, one of their responsibilities.

1229
01:24:27,337 --> 01:24:27,437
Now,

1230
01:24:28,488 --> 01:24:33,873
Could it be that one day went by when they didn't entirely possible, but we will certainly reinforce that.

1231
01:24:33,913 --> 01:24:41,280
But I want to make sure that, you know, the people that use this know what they're doing, but we'll provide that.

1232
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,302
I just had a question.

1233
01:24:44,503 --> 01:24:50,628
Um, do the schools, um, conduct like practice drills to prepare for an emergency?

1234
01:24:51,289 --> 01:24:54,412
Um, so they can time themselves because it does, I guess,

1235
01:24:55,008 --> 01:24:58,910
the device has to be applied within four minutes of the cardiac arrest.

1236
01:24:58,930 --> 01:25:13,178
So I was just curious, like, if you're in the high school and it's in the front lobby and somebody's way down and they have to, you know, walkie-talkie that person, come down here, we have an emergency, they have to go get the defibrillator and then get to the person.

1237
01:25:13,599 --> 01:25:15,940
You know, I was just curious, like, how that was going to work.

1238
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:19,282
Well, you know, again, four minutes is the

1239
01:25:20,188 --> 01:25:23,410
guideline from the point of which the heart stops.

1240
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:29,853
It's not when a person's starting to feel chest pain, or starting to feel dizzy, or things of that type.

1241
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:31,593
So it's tricky.

1242
01:25:31,633 --> 01:25:36,516
I mean, obviously, we have a 500,000 square foot high school.

1243
01:25:36,576 --> 01:25:37,996
And things can happen anywhere.

1244
01:25:38,617 --> 01:25:44,399
But obviously, our goal is to get people to the scene as quickly as possible.

1245
01:25:44,419 --> 01:25:50,002
Same thing with CPR, same thing with any other, with EpiPens, anything that requires a medical intervention

1246
01:25:50,338 --> 01:25:51,898
to get them there as quickly as possible.

1247
01:25:52,498 --> 01:25:58,339
I'll go over it with Tony and with other people and see exactly if we can give you more specifics as to how they would respond.

1248
01:25:58,639 --> 01:25:59,420
Thanks.

1249
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,360
Very good.

1250
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,300
Point of information, Mr. Benedetto.

1251
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:03,640
Each floor.

1252
01:26:19,481 --> 01:26:20,957
who I want to be on the way back.

1253
01:26:22,603 --> 01:26:22,883
We hope.

1254
01:26:24,004 --> 01:26:24,184
Ms.

1255
01:26:24,224 --> 01:26:24,704
Cuno.

1256
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,345
Thank you, Mr. Benetton.

1257
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:36,809
Well, one point of information is that on the fields, our athletic director, I'm sorry, our athletic trainer is always there.

1258
01:26:36,889 --> 01:26:39,890
And I know that she knows what she's doing.

1259
01:26:40,871 --> 01:26:51,235
I know that when we have games and when she's not able to be at a particular game because she's at some, you know, another game, we also have EMTs that have to be on the field to make sure that they're there.

1260
01:26:51,315 --> 01:26:51,435
So,

1261
01:26:51,935 --> 01:26:53,116
but I know that part of it.

1262
01:26:53,476 --> 01:27:04,461
I guess the curiosity of that is, like, we can't mandate everybody to take it, and we have to make sure that we are letting the people that want to do this learn it the correct way.

1263
01:27:05,062 --> 01:27:09,324
So is Tony Vento going to be providing the courses, the classes?

1264
01:27:09,344 --> 01:27:20,349
I'll sit with Tony, and let's go over a list of people who are more likely to be available and capable, and then we'll approach them and try to add to the list.

1265
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:31,548
It's unlikely that we're going to be able to get every person in every corner, nor should we try, because I think inappropriate application is more dangerous than none at all.

1266
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:37,650
But Armstrong is more than willing, I know, in this building as well, to train whoever wants to learn.

1267
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:40,412
They were more than willing to train people that want to become certified.

1268
01:27:41,651 --> 01:27:42,672
Okay, thank you.

1269
01:27:42,692 --> 01:27:47,337
There's a motion on the floor of it by Mr. Benedetto seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1270
01:27:47,837 --> 01:27:49,479
Roll call vote has been requested.

1271
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:50,740
As well as Ms.

1272
01:27:51,841 --> 01:27:52,602
Stone's question.

1273
01:27:53,483 --> 01:27:55,885
I actually forget what your question was, I'm sorry.

1274
01:27:58,922 --> 01:28:07,792
The list by school and to also have a list posted next to the defibrillator if it's checked every day and if it's signed off on.

1275
01:28:07,812 --> 01:28:08,413
Maintenance.

1276
01:28:08,433 --> 01:28:10,576
On the motion, roll call vote, Ms.

1277
01:28:10,616 --> 01:28:11,116
Vanden Heuvel.

1278
01:28:11,136 --> 01:28:11,256
Yes.

1279
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:17,730
That's good.

1280
01:28:24,495 --> 01:28:27,477
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero negative.

1281
01:28:27,857 --> 01:28:28,698
Motion passes.

1282
01:28:29,478 --> 01:28:32,620
Update report on elementary class size, Mr. Superintendent.

1283
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,742
You asked for a report that broke it out by actual classes.

1284
01:28:36,243 --> 01:28:37,784
You have that report in front of you.

1285
01:28:37,804 --> 01:28:39,825
It was appended to the previous report.

1286
01:28:40,346 --> 01:28:45,409
It shows you what each teacher has as of the same date that the previous report was provided.

1287
01:28:45,569 --> 01:28:46,350
Happy to take any questions.

1288
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:52,318
Motion to accept this report in place on file by Mr. Scary.

1289
01:28:52,358 --> 01:28:53,719
Is there a second on the floor?

1290
01:28:53,839 --> 01:28:54,039
Ms.

1291
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:54,639
Van de Kloot.

1292
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:56,580
All those in favor?

1293
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:58,361
All those opposed?

1294
01:28:58,381 --> 01:28:59,261
Motion passes.

1295
01:29:00,582 --> 01:29:01,142
Oh, I'm sorry.

1296
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:03,283
Mr. Benedetto.

1297
01:29:03,563 --> 01:29:04,423
Oh, thank you so much.

1298
01:29:04,503 --> 01:29:08,705
First of all, I want to thank you for providing us with this court report in timely manner.

1299
01:29:09,105 --> 01:29:13,347
Secondly, I would like you to present it to the city council as they requested the numbers.

1300
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:27,677
And I ask that they get the breakdown as well so that they can see all the transparency and that where our schools are highly populated in certain areas, okay?

1301
01:29:28,325 --> 01:29:39,615
Also, this report will become very handy as well when you provide us the other report on any new developments in the city and where kids are.

1302
01:29:40,355 --> 01:29:51,365
If the new developments are in the area where our numbers are higher, that will give us some information and some planning for our budget and for our space, because we want to make sure we have enough space for all the children.

1303
01:29:52,917 --> 01:30:04,787
The next thing I wanted to say is, having looked at this report, I'm wondering does this include children that may be in a supported class and come into the regular classroom?

1304
01:30:05,088 --> 01:30:06,929
Do the numbers go up during the day?

1305
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:13,215
If a youngster comes from a substantially separated class, they come with the teachers or the staff that's with them.

1306
01:30:13,815 --> 01:30:18,980
So these numbers could, during the day... The number could increase mostly for gym or for some of the larger

1307
01:30:19,642 --> 01:30:24,784
activities, but certainly not for classes that are substantially contained.

1308
01:30:25,424 --> 01:30:30,686
So not, not most, most generally not for academic classes, but more social classes.

1309
01:30:30,846 --> 01:30:32,326
Occasionally a youngster may try.

1310
01:30:32,346 --> 01:30:33,967
They may try to put a youngster in the class.

1311
01:30:33,987 --> 01:30:34,427
Okay.

1312
01:30:34,607 --> 01:30:38,789
I just want to be clear and put it out there because that, you know, that's a question that's always asked.

1313
01:30:38,829 --> 01:30:48,292
The other thing you got to keep in mind is on a given day, you know, with not to say that we encourage this, but any given day, a hundred percent of the pupils aren't always in attendance.

1314
01:30:48,975 --> 01:30:54,960
So if you have 20 youngsters in a class, you might have 18 on a given day, you know, on that day and then another day you might have all 20.

1315
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:59,583
So it just depends on who's there on any given day as well.

1316
01:31:00,824 --> 01:31:09,511
So my, my other comment is that just looking at this is that the second grade class is, is pretty, it's a pretty big class.

1317
01:31:10,592 --> 01:31:15,075
So we want to keep that in mind when, um, the, as they get older.

1318
01:31:15,755 --> 01:31:18,657
You know, because that's a large grouping of students.

1319
01:31:18,677 --> 01:31:20,678
You have almost.

1320
01:31:20,899 --> 01:31:21,819
Almost across the board.

1321
01:31:21,939 --> 01:31:28,163
Across the board, an average of over 22, except for the Brooks School, which is a little bit smaller.

1322
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:29,324
So would you like to address that?

1323
01:31:30,805 --> 01:31:31,626
Absolutely.

1324
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:39,331
Just this past month, we've had a bubble in our second grade.

1325
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:43,594
So at the McGlynn and at the Roberts in particular,

1326
01:31:44,072 --> 01:31:47,335
We had five new students just for second grade.

1327
01:31:48,216 --> 01:31:52,500
So yes, there is a bubble that's going on in that particular classroom.

1328
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:59,185
We have students moving into Station Landing and students, you know, where the Malden-Metford line is, where all the apartments are.

1329
01:31:59,225 --> 01:32:02,248
We had one or two students moving in from that area.

1330
01:32:02,288 --> 01:32:07,233
But it's just unusual that we would have five, particularly in second grade.

1331
01:32:07,793 --> 01:32:11,036
Those students were all designated for the McGlynn Elementary School.

1332
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:15,380
And I actually had to split them up because I couldn't put five new students.

1333
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:20,344
As you can see at the McGlynn Elementary, we have 23 and 24 students.

1334
01:32:20,765 --> 01:32:23,207
But the Roberts has always been high in second grade.

1335
01:32:24,869 --> 01:32:30,594
So if there's a way we could transport students on a bus, we will try to do that just to make sure our numbers don't go over 24.

1336
01:32:33,852 --> 01:32:48,037
The only concern I have with that is siblings or, you know, if they've already been in a building for a while and they're comfortable there to at some point switch them because of the number of students in that particular school.

1337
01:32:48,477 --> 01:32:54,679
So, I mean, that's not my hope is to have to do that to any family or any students.

1338
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:56,100
So I-.

1339
01:32:56,120 --> 01:33:00,061
Well, the other thing we need to be cognizant of is that if they have siblings, then siblings we would

1340
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:03,571
just out of courtesy, move the siblings with the family as well.

1341
01:33:03,731 --> 01:33:08,192
So it could be conceivably two or three students in one school move.

1342
01:33:10,472 --> 01:33:18,694
It just seems like the numbers are somewhat higher than I anticipated for our second and maybe third grade.

1343
01:33:18,974 --> 01:33:23,455
Looks a little high in some schools to me, and a little bit in fourth.

1344
01:33:23,735 --> 01:33:28,816
Just to keep an eye on this, and if more students in that age level come into the district,

1345
01:33:29,287 --> 01:33:37,335
We just want to be very, very aware of those class sizes and keep an eye on them throughout the calendar year.

1346
01:33:37,415 --> 01:33:41,159
So I'm glad that we are now getting this report twice a year.

1347
01:33:41,379 --> 01:33:50,568
I think that was a motion that was passed so that we get it in early September when kids settling in and then again in January so we can keep an eye on this.

1348
01:33:50,932 --> 01:33:53,034
Thank you for the report, Mr. Superintendent.

1349
01:33:53,174 --> 01:34:00,159
Um, when you present us with the new development report that was requested, could you also include this with it?

1350
01:34:00,519 --> 01:34:03,322
So that way we have both reports together at the same time.

1351
01:34:03,762 --> 01:34:04,983
I think it would be helpful too.

1352
01:34:05,463 --> 01:34:10,867
And thank you for sharing it with the city councils and being so transparent about everything.

1353
01:34:11,128 --> 01:34:14,190
So just so we have one understanding that we have to have all the time,

1354
01:34:14,762 --> 01:34:18,543
I never send anything to the civil city council like this until you get it first.

1355
01:34:18,703 --> 01:34:18,943
Right.

1356
01:34:19,203 --> 01:34:26,365
So it may be a little bit of a weight sometimes when they ask for something like this, but you always get it first before they get it.

1357
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:27,666
And I appreciate that.

1358
01:34:27,766 --> 01:34:28,006
Okay.

1359
01:34:28,066 --> 01:34:31,347
And then we send it through the council just so you understand the process.

1360
01:34:31,627 --> 01:34:31,767
Okay.

1361
01:34:32,287 --> 01:34:35,028
On the motion that this report be received and placed on file.

1362
01:34:35,088 --> 01:34:35,988
All those in favor.

1363
01:34:36,628 --> 01:34:37,389
All those opposed.

1364
01:34:37,429 --> 01:34:38,189
Motion passes.

1365
01:34:39,529 --> 01:34:42,170
Recommendation to approve reasonable use policy.

1366
01:34:42,738 --> 01:34:57,130
So this, uh, policy was in front of you, uh, earlier and we went, took it back to review it to make sure there were no situations that we were missing using current, you know, let's say legal opinions that were out there.

1367
01:34:57,190 --> 01:34:58,531
We vetted it at this time.

1368
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,933
We believe that this is ready to go.

1369
01:35:01,353 --> 01:35:04,796
So I recommend that you approve it.

1370
01:35:04,836 --> 01:35:05,417
Mr. Scary.

1371
01:35:05,437 --> 01:35:08,179
Just a one question through you to the superintendent.

1372
01:35:08,859 --> 01:35:18,123
Uh, Roy, I've reviewed the document and it indicated two places that the individual that had the document, uh, I've read and understand the rules.

1373
01:35:18,183 --> 01:35:23,525
I understand if they break any of the rules, I may lose the privilege of using the internet and may have other consequences.

1374
01:35:24,365 --> 01:35:26,926
Uh, is there space for a signature line in the date?

1375
01:35:27,507 --> 01:35:28,087
There will be.

1376
01:35:28,287 --> 01:35:30,528
When a person gets in state, they sign off on the, uh,

1377
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:37,285
Okay, and the copy that goes out to the individuals, could you please provide us a copy of it also?

1378
01:35:37,345 --> 01:35:41,529
If you look on the cover page, all users must sign off on the reasonable use policy each year.

1379
01:35:41,789 --> 01:35:47,354
Right, but I just didn't see a sign, a line for a signature or a letter.

1380
01:35:47,474 --> 01:35:52,959
Okay, and it's done individually, it's not done on one sheet by each student?

1381
01:35:52,979 --> 01:35:53,540
Individually.

1382
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:54,580
Good, thank you.

1383
01:35:55,842 --> 01:35:56,362
Very good.

1384
01:35:56,842 --> 01:35:57,043
Ms.

1385
01:35:57,063 --> 01:35:57,283
Kretz.

1386
01:35:58,465 --> 01:36:00,466
I just wanted to share some helpful tips.

1387
01:36:00,506 --> 01:36:12,234
I think it's a good idea for all of us to make sure we keep our kids safe at home by monitoring their sites and limiting the time they spend on their devices, even when they're at home.

1388
01:36:12,594 --> 01:36:15,776
Kind of implement something similar to this in your own household.

1389
01:36:16,336 --> 01:36:17,237
I think it's a good idea.

1390
01:36:18,077 --> 01:36:18,498
Very good.

1391
01:36:21,801 --> 01:36:28,490
I just want to make sure that where it says here like this is for grade 5, but I'm assuming this is for everyone.

1392
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:30,572
Yeah.

1393
01:36:31,033 --> 01:36:35,819
Also to send it home so a parent and a guardian could sign and make sure that they are.

1394
01:36:35,839 --> 01:36:38,102
Once you're approving it, we will.

1395
01:36:38,675 --> 01:36:39,816
then we work on distribution.

1396
01:36:40,296 --> 01:36:40,556
Okay.

1397
01:36:40,776 --> 01:36:43,738
But I just want to, it wasn't clear here if it was just the student or not.

1398
01:36:43,758 --> 01:36:48,660
And I just want to make sure that we incorporate the guardian or the parent to sign off also.

1399
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:52,162
So that way they can't come down the road and say, gee, I wasn't aware of it.

1400
01:36:52,522 --> 01:36:53,323
I didn't know about it.

1401
01:36:55,584 --> 01:36:55,884
All right.

1402
01:36:55,924 --> 01:37:03,448
And on that motion as amended to accept this report that Mr. Scary, is there a second?

1403
01:37:03,728 --> 01:37:03,968
Yes.

1404
01:37:03,988 --> 01:37:05,209
Second by Ms.

1405
01:37:05,249 --> 01:37:05,649
Cuno.

1406
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:06,810
Roll call vote.

1407
01:37:08,372 --> 01:37:08,612
Yes.

1408
01:37:09,953 --> 01:37:14,195
Yes.

1409
01:37:15,736 --> 01:37:16,036
Yes.

1410
01:37:16,256 --> 01:37:17,917
Seven in the affirmative, zero on the negative.

1411
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:20,519
The policy is approved.

1412
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,520
Negotiation in legal matters?

1413
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:24,841
None, Mr. Superintendent?

1414
01:37:29,363 --> 01:37:30,344
Certainly, Mr. Scari.

1415
01:37:30,384 --> 01:37:31,224
Point of information?

1416
01:37:31,244 --> 01:37:34,986
A few months back, we met in an executive session regarding a couple of contracts.

1417
01:37:35,046 --> 01:37:36,707
I wondered if we could get an update on those.

1418
01:37:36,807 --> 01:37:37,688
I mean, it's coming.

1419
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:46,054
I would rather see it sooner than later because these poor souls have been in limbo for a number of months and I think we have to get this done.

1420
01:37:46,074 --> 01:37:48,716
The unions to come in and work with us until they're ready.

1421
01:37:48,756 --> 01:37:50,156
We can't, I can't push it.

1422
01:37:50,837 --> 01:37:52,057
We should expect something very soon.

1423
01:37:52,838 --> 01:37:53,218
Thank you.

1424
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:54,999
Mr Benedetto.

1425
01:37:55,259 --> 01:37:55,659
Thank you.

1426
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:03,644
Um, under requested reports, um, the quarterly financial report, you said that we would be getting it soon.

1427
01:38:04,164 --> 01:38:05,665
We voted, um,

1428
01:38:07,127 --> 01:38:12,932
as a committee to get these, um, the community schools financial report on a quarterly basis.

1429
01:38:12,993 --> 01:38:15,555
And we haven't had one since before last June.

1430
01:38:15,955 --> 01:38:18,277
So we're almost a year out, Mr. Superintendent.

1431
01:38:18,618 --> 01:38:22,902
So I'm just going to answer what I answered before until the hall straightens out the accounts.

1432
01:38:23,462 --> 01:38:26,125
I'm not going to give you a report where co-mingled money is.

1433
01:38:26,245 --> 01:38:28,427
It can't be, can't be separated out.

1434
01:38:28,447 --> 01:38:30,208
So I can actually give you an accurate report.

1435
01:38:30,549 --> 01:38:31,369
They're working on it.

1436
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:32,811
We have major changes.

1437
01:38:33,752 --> 01:38:53,690
The financial administration of the city and major change in the financial administration of the schools and they're working on that right now I would hope to have it soon But as late as last week, I'm down there talking to The people in the City Hall trying to get that broken out so we can give you an accurate report The good news is that we're not in jeopardy of anything financial

1438
01:38:54,651 --> 01:39:05,962
The bad news is, what do you call it, I'm still trying to get this separated out so that you can see each account very cleanly as opposed to having four or five accounts somehow consolidated together, which doesn't give you a real picture.

1439
01:39:05,983 --> 01:39:06,223
Right.

1440
01:39:06,243 --> 01:39:11,268
They're tracking through a couple of years of revenue deposits to make sure they're in the proper program.

1441
01:39:12,008 --> 01:39:12,208
Okay.

1442
01:39:12,788 --> 01:39:14,089
I'm just asking for an update.

1443
01:39:14,109 --> 01:39:15,530
I asked for this in January.

1444
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:16,670
It's two months later.

1445
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:25,774
I, you said in a few weeks, because the city, the mayor said that the city was done posting what they needed to win the last time I asked.

1446
01:39:26,234 --> 01:39:28,575
And now it's been more than a month since then.

1447
01:39:28,775 --> 01:39:29,375
That's the reason.

1448
01:39:29,816 --> 01:39:32,897
And so I am, I am asking for a timeline.

1449
01:39:33,857 --> 01:39:39,960
Soon as it, as soon as I get the numbers, the way they should be given to me, I will be happy to give you the report and I hope it's soon.

1450
01:39:40,692 --> 01:39:40,952
Okay.

1451
01:39:41,052 --> 01:39:49,341
And I'm asking you through the, um, from now to the next meeting, just look at a few of these items and see if you can clear any of them up from the list that we have.

1452
01:39:49,862 --> 01:39:50,062
Okay.

1453
01:39:51,143 --> 01:39:51,583
Thank you.

1454
01:39:51,603 --> 01:39:51,944
All right.

1455
01:39:51,964 --> 01:39:58,470
A new business school committee resolution be resolved at the metric school committees expressed sincere condolences to the family of Roger Wint.

1456
01:39:58,991 --> 01:40:02,454
Mr. Wint was the former Metro public schools director of building and grounds.

1457
01:40:04,334 --> 01:40:09,199
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Margaret Yarrati.

1458
01:40:09,519 --> 01:40:09,639
Ms.

1459
01:40:09,659 --> 01:40:12,942
Yarrati was the mother of Medford Public School's math teacher, Janet Forty.

1460
01:40:14,644 --> 01:40:19,729
Be it resolved that the Medford Public School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of James Coughlin.

1461
01:40:19,809 --> 01:40:22,932
Mr. Coughlin was a retired Medford Public School physical ed teacher.

1462
01:40:23,352 --> 01:40:26,896
He was the husband of Paula Coughlin, a Kids' Corner preschool teacher.

1463
01:40:28,198 --> 01:40:31,080
Also the mother of Chris Coughlin, who's one of our Memphis police officers.

1464
01:40:31,541 --> 01:40:34,743
And their other son, Mark, and Carrie, daughter.

1465

Ron Corbett, a Medford High School graduate, star athlete, pitcher, baseball player in Oakland as system.

1466
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:44,451
Is that what the?

1467
01:40:44,611 --> 01:40:46,372
Oakland A's system, I'm sorry.

1468
01:40:46,793 --> 01:40:49,635
He's in the Suffolk Hall of Fame and the Medford High School Hall of Fame.

1469
01:40:50,255 --> 01:40:55,900
Please all rise for a moment of silence in passing of these Medford residents and or teachers.

1470
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:12,323
A couple of announcements by the superintendent.

1471
01:41:13,204 --> 01:41:21,591
So I want to thank Anne-Marie Cugno and the Italian Consul General Nicola De Santis for Italian Day.

1472
01:41:21,611 --> 01:41:23,332
It was a great event up at the high school.

1473
01:41:24,052 --> 01:41:37,003
It was exciting and the youngsters enjoyed sitting in the Ferrari and the Maserati and listening to La Traviata and maybe sampling some food from Italy to getting a sense of

1474
01:41:38,237 --> 01:41:39,017
Italian culture.

1475
01:41:39,037 --> 01:41:39,997
I think it was a great day.

1476
01:41:40,357 --> 01:41:44,298
Dovetailed with the science fair, with a few other things going on with Dr. Seuss.

1477
01:41:44,358 --> 01:41:46,699
A lot going on in the public schools.

1478
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:53,840
You have a March handout from Lisa, which gives you some activities in March.

1479
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,181
It's very busy.

1480
01:41:56,221 --> 01:41:59,482
You can't make everything, but the ones you can make, it's worth it.

1481
01:42:00,162 --> 01:42:02,202
And there's a lot of good things going on in the schools.

1482
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:05,783
And at our next meeting, there'll be a number of other presentations to students

1483
01:42:06,486 --> 01:42:08,947
who have achieved some exciting things.

1484
01:42:10,547 --> 01:42:13,268
And we want to recognize them in public.

1485
01:42:13,328 --> 01:42:16,249
And we will do that on our meeting on the 20th.

1486
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:19,370
A lot of good stuff going on.

1487
01:42:19,490 --> 01:42:31,773
You did get a handout tonight from the actual presentation by the governor on Friday of the $495,000 grant for the culinary arts and the hospitality program.

1488
01:42:32,572 --> 01:42:37,153
We expect another major announcement coming up this week, possibly later this week or early next.

1489
01:42:38,474 --> 01:42:45,816
Another major grant which dovetails with our SOI requests and other requests for funding for capital planning.

1490
01:42:46,856 --> 01:42:52,638
We'll be working on when we go to the council fairly soon and we'll get back to you and let you know what's going on.

1491
01:42:52,858 --> 01:43:01,120
We received the other $100,000 grant from the Life Sciences for Robotic Gums and that the vocational and the high school

1492
01:43:02,253 --> 01:43:06,998
And you also have something on Middle School Mathematics Night, Pathways to High School Mathematics.

1493
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:13,605
Important because a lot of people aren't sure of how the progression of courses take place.

1494
01:43:14,306 --> 01:43:23,116
And I think that this is a good opportunity for people to become aware of that so that there's no misunderstanding of what a youngster can take for coursework.

1495
01:43:27,368 --> 01:43:44,778
Are we utilizing the the city calendar because this is a situation where I'm aware of it But on Thursday April 6 from 7 to 8 the method high school is having a science lecture and then on the same night

1496
01:43:45,593 --> 01:43:48,655
We're having a method high school, oh I'm sorry, it was a math.

1497
01:43:49,395 --> 01:43:50,736
One says math, one says science.

1498
01:43:50,796 --> 01:43:51,916
I thought it was two separate things.

1499
01:43:51,976 --> 01:43:52,697
I apologize.

1500
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:54,358
So I guess that's all one.

1501
01:43:54,818 --> 01:43:55,578
We have two of them.

1502
01:43:56,339 --> 01:44:01,401
And then just to piggyback, I just want to take the opportunity to say thank you to the Italian consulate.

1503
01:44:03,322 --> 01:44:06,204
and to Cassidy who helped us out last Friday.

1504
01:44:06,524 --> 01:44:08,405
It was just a great day.

1505
01:44:08,465 --> 01:44:10,487
This was a program that I was approached on.

1506
01:44:11,627 --> 01:44:19,332
They are trying, the Italian consulate is really into education and he really wanted to showcase as much as he possibly can

1507
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:28,643
not only in helping us out with the CASA grants, but also to incorporate the culture of where the Italian background is really from.

1508
01:44:28,803 --> 01:44:31,424
And so he wanted to showcase different schools.

1509
01:44:31,464 --> 01:44:34,425
We were fortunate enough, there was 14 schools that they showcased.

1510
01:44:34,945 --> 01:44:41,768
We were fortunate enough that they selected us as their first, which I believe was very beneficial for us because

1511
01:44:42,339 --> 01:44:48,304
We really got to showcase the technical side, which our Ferrari people came in and were very impressed by.

1512
01:44:48,324 --> 01:44:54,229
The students, the opportunity to see the cars was open to everyone.

1513
01:44:54,429 --> 01:44:56,791
It wasn't just open to one side or another side.

1514
01:44:56,951 --> 01:44:58,272
All students had that opportunity.

1515
01:44:58,864 --> 01:45:14,632
We were able to showcase Cafe Electra, who were very generous enough to provide lunch for everyone who attended, which was the Italian consulate, his staff, Casa President, the Ferrari people, and also the opera singers who actually had just come in from Italy.

1516
01:45:16,193 --> 01:45:19,555
So there was a lot of discussion, and I was happy to say that

1517
01:45:20,389 --> 01:45:26,133
The staff and the Italian consulate are really thinking of trying to pilot a lot of different programs.

1518
01:45:26,573 --> 01:45:40,363
And because we have a different jewel in our city, which is the technical side and the academic side of a school, they were really talking about doing this much more in the future and really more partnering, which made me really happy.

1519
01:45:40,423 --> 01:45:48,328
And I just want to say thank you to the administration, to Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio, who really helped me at the last minute trying to organize it.

1520
01:45:49,917 --> 01:45:53,318
to Miss Nelson, Miss Caldwell, and of course, our superintendent.

1521
01:45:53,338 --> 01:46:01,420
It was a really nice day, and I loved just seeing the kids' reactions when they saw the vehicle and, you know, walking into the Ferrari and getting pictures.

1522
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:02,380
And it was a good day.

1523
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,220
It was a very good day.

1524
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:04,300
Very good.

1525
01:46:04,401 --> 01:46:06,241
Thank you so much for your hard work on this.

1526
01:46:06,661 --> 01:46:07,161
Oh, thank you.

1527
01:46:07,301 --> 01:46:08,041
Miss Day.

1528
01:46:08,461 --> 01:46:11,782
Will you send a letter of thank you to them for coming?

1529
01:46:11,802 --> 01:46:12,122
We will.

1530
01:46:12,142 --> 01:46:12,222
Yeah.

1531
01:46:12,262 --> 01:46:12,883
Thank you.

1532
01:46:12,903 --> 01:46:13,123
We will.

1533
01:46:13,903 --> 01:46:14,443
Miss Van de Kloop.

1534
01:46:18,341 --> 01:46:21,345
Very good on the motion that we adjourn all those in favor
