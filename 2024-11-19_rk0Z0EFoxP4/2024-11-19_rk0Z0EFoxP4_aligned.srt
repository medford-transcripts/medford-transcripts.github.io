President Caravaglia?

18
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:54,895
Present.

19
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:56,997
Please rise and slip the flag.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:07,844
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

21
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:18,049
Okay.

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,571
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

23
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:27,073
21-627, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved

24
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:37,078
that the traffic engineer evaluate the recent traffic signal change at the intersection of Harvard Street and Mystic Avenue in the interest of public safety.

25
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:37,618
Councilor Felder.

26
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:38,880
Thank you, Mr. President.

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:47,290
After this resolution tonight, I received a number of calls from residents on Harvard Street regarding a change that they recently made

28
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,271
at the intersection of Harvard and Mystic Ave.

29
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:56,754
And what's happening is a lot of the cars are backing up and the queues going all the way down Harvard Street.

30
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:59,855
It's virtually impossible to get out of your driveway.

31
00:02:00,595 --> 00:02:04,677
There's been some, from what I'm hearing, numerous near accidents.

32
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:10,760
And I'm just asking that the traffic engineer just take a look at this and

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,741
and actually contact the neighbors as well to get their input.

34
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:24,524
I'm not sure how much input was gathered from the residents before they made this change, but it's a change that has impacted the neighborhood.

35
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:26,245
And I just wanted to bring that forward.

36
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:34,347
And I ask that this be moved to the traffic engineer for further review and move approval.

37
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:34,687
Thank you.

38
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:36,648
Recording in progress.

39
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:39,544
Vice president night.

40
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:41,025
Mister president, thank you very much.

41
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:43,485
I think the sponsor this resolution for bringing the matter forward.

42
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,567
I do believe this is something that this council discussed a couple years back when the casino first opened.

43
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:52,628
As part of mass thoughts plans with the opening of the casino.

44
00:02:52,668 --> 00:03:01,650
I believe that they took out of the street and they made the left hand lane going towards the middle of all left him turn only.

45
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:06,743
And that's what's created a bunch of congestion in the neighborhood, Mr. President.

46
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:09,183
And I second Councilor Falco's resolution.

47
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,584
I think this is something that needs to be addressed.

48
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:12,024
It's been going on for far too long.

49
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:20,045
And the left-hand turn only lane has created quite a bit of disruption in the neighborhood, and it's something that needs to be addressed.

50
00:03:21,886 --> 00:03:24,786
So on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Vice President Knight.

51
00:03:26,427 --> 00:03:27,147
All those in favor?

52
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:27,647
Aye.

53
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:29,097
All those opposed?

54
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:30,638
Motion passes.

55
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,700
21628 offered by Councilor Falco.

56
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:41,746
May it be resolved that the DPW repair the road in front of 31 Wildwood Road in the interest of public safety.

57
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:42,566
Councilor Falco.

58
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:44,107
Thank you, Mr. President.

59
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:52,833
I received a call from a resident on Wildwood Road regarding, back a few years ago, there was some major type of pipe repair.

60
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:54,174
I believe it was,

61
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:55,794
with the street.

62
00:03:56,375 --> 00:04:13,176
And what they did is they actually stored, they used actually wildwood as a staging area where they stored the pipes before they installed them and over time, I guess they were there for a while, over time what they did is they left kind of like a depression in the road, it's not like a pothole, but the road slopes off.

63
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:15,778
in front of 31 Wildwood.

64
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:24,164
So when it rains now, there's a significant say puddle that runs pretty much the length of 31 Wildwood road.

65
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:40,675
So I'm asking that the DPW, if they could go by and just fill that depression in front of Wildwood road in the interest of public safety and to ensure that the city, the street drains properly.

66
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:41,656
Thank you.

67
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:42,336
Move approval.

68
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:43,657
Any further discussion?

69
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:48,516
Second on the motion by Councilor Falcone, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

70
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,077
All those in favor?

71
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:50,498
Aye.

72
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:51,879
Motion passes.

73
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,023
Petitions, presentations and similar matters.

74
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:13,325
21629, petition for a common picture license by Serena Nazaro, 14 Putney Circle, Billerica, Mass, 01821, Forest Center Enterprises, Inc., doing business as Petey's Pizza, 336 Austin Avenue, Medford.

75
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:18,849
Serena, are you on the call here somewhere?

76
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:23,693
Oh.

77
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:24,634
She should be on Zoom.

78
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:25,515
Yes, she's here.

79
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:28,773
Are you going to speak for her, Mr. Beacon?

80
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:29,773
No, she can speak.

81
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,014
If you have any questions, she can, I just wanted to interview her.

82
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:32,914
Okay.

83
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:33,735
Ms.

84
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:34,695
Nazaro, are you here?

85
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:35,815
Yes, I'm here.

86
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,196
How are you, Ms.

87
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:37,356
David?

88
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,456
I'm doing well, thank you.

89
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:40,217
Could you give us your name and address on the record, please?

90
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:42,578
I'm sorry, what was that?

91
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,099
Could you give us your name and address on the record, please?

92
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,901
Yep, it's Serena Nazaro, 14 Putney Circle, Bill Rickenmass, 01821.

93
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:53,498
Thank you.

94
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:57,662
At this point, I'll turn this over to the licensing chairman, which is Councilor Scott Pelley.

95
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,146
Thank you, Mr. President.

96
00:06:03,726 --> 00:06:10,292
It looks like it's a changeover from what was the expresso pizza on Boston Ave.

97
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:19,839
And it looks like our petitioner is Peony's Pizza, a very well-known and reputable

98
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,130
business in neighbor communities, correct?

99
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:28,371
And everything I see here, Mr. President, is in order.

100
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:35,732
The reputation of this company is a very positive one, and I move approval.

101
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:38,433
Any discussion?

102
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:45,094
So all in the motion for approval by Councilor Scott Pele, seconded by Vice President Knight.

103
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:47,254
All those in favor?

104
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:48,195
Aye.

105
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:48,515
Aye.

106
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:49,755
Opposed?

107
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:50,815
Motion passes.

108
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:55,420
Congratulations and we'll hope to see you for some pizza very soon.

109
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,162
Thank you very much.

110
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:58,343
Have a good night.

111
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:12,774
Before we go to the next communication from the mayor, I'd like to introduce our new parking director, Faye Morrison.

112
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:24,640
Faye, if you'd like to get up and give us a little brief history about yourself and what your plans are before we get into the stuff that you're looking for.

113
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:34,905
I come out of, before I was here, I worked at Newton, did the same thing for Newton that I'm doing for you, creating a department.

114
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:37,654
So far, it's been very exciting.

115
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:47,898
It's been a lot of fact-finding work for you and a lot of cooperation with Reef Republic.

116
00:07:48,558 --> 00:07:54,660
We're still having some meetings about the transition, obviously, but we've posted jobs.

117
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,161
I've got those descriptions done and posted.

118
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:01,003
We've actually begun to hire an interview, which is good.

119
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:08,285
Tonight, hopefully it will go well because without those systems in place, I can't finish building this department.

120
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:11,106
So that's why I'm here before you tonight.

121
00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:20,229
I've been in transportation for a long time in various different capacities, but most recently as the parking manager for the city of Newton for seven years.

122
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:23,350
And I've been here about six weeks.

123
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,710
Everyone has been helpful.

124
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:27,511
eager.

125
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:33,776
And I wish I could tell you that this is going to be a quick, pretty process.

126
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:37,158
It's going not going to be terribly quick.

127
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:41,401
There are some things that need to be built first before I can start adding on to the things that are needed.

128
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:43,443
But we're going to get there.

129
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:49,827
And I think we're going to get there because the city has been is really invested in doing this and has supported me.

130
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:52,809
I can't thank the mayor enough for supporting me doing it.

131
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:55,631
Well, we could do we could do it badly.

132
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:56,292
I think

133
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:59,076
We've had, I think Medford's had enough of that.

134
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:08,822
I'd like to do it well and have a good solid parking system that when I retire, that the city is proud of and that will go on and work and be profitable for you after I'm gone.

135
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,223
So that's my goal.

136
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:10,823
Thank you.

137
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:12,584
Anybody have any questions for Ms.

138
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:15,166
Morrison before we do the quick communication from the mayor?

139
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:16,066
Welcome.

140
00:09:17,227 --> 00:09:17,967
Thank you so much.

141
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:18,688
Okay.

142
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:21,690
Communications from the mayor. 21630.

143
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:47,677
Mr. President and counselors, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approves the following five-year contracts after a three-quote process conducted by the parking director for a parking data management system in a truck-car rental lease.

144
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:56,361
It is the intention of the City to enter a five-year agreement with GT Techno USA Corporation in enterprise fleet management

145
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:58,959
Inc.

146
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:08,579
Master General Laws Chapter 30B, Section 12 requires that the City Council approval for a contract that exceeds three years, which is why we come before you today.

147
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,761
So, Amendment 1.

148
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:22,584
Allow the city and the Department of Parking to enter into a five-year lease agreement for the acquisition of vehicles for the purpose of collecting money in enforcing parking rules within the city of Medford.

149
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:28,108
Please see the attached copy of the presentation materials.

150
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,328
Amendment two, agreement two.

151
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:34,992
Allow the city and the Department of Parking to enter into a five-year contract to acquire

152
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:46,425
the data management systems and how we're required to collect monies, enforce parking rules, manage permit parking program, and administer the appeals process.

153
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:50,367
Please see the attached for a copy of the quotation.

154
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:56,750
The above request is made in five year time periods because that is the most cost effective procedure.

155
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:03,093
It also allows for a long-term planning as a new parking department is formed and developed.

156
00:11:03,937 --> 00:11:16,864
I respectfully request to recommend that your own body, pursuant to the provisions of national law, chapter 30B, section 12, approves and authorize the city of Medford-DeWinter into agreement with the above-mentioned vendors for five years.

157
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:20,426
Respectfully submitted, Mayor Lengelkern, Mayor.

158
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:23,308
Good evening, thank you.

159
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:27,310
like to give us a little.

160
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,514
Well, I will start with the vehicle rental.

161
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:38,380
When I was coming on board, I was told that we would have vehicles, obviously that has not manifested itself.

162
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,744
We have what will be turned over to us will be I think a 2014 Nissan panel van

163
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:52,295
Operation Unknown and a 2016 RAV4.

164
00:11:53,715 --> 00:12:00,258
We need, I need to hire at minimum at this point, five parking control specialists.

165
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:02,299
Those will be the enforcement folks.

166
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,840
So I need a vehicle for each one of them.

167
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:11,243
The second thing I need is the two trucks for your collection, three-man collection crew.

168
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:15,550
The reason why I chose a lease is because I don't have a budget.

169
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:18,372
So I don't have money to buy anything.

170
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:27,199
So this was through this government program gave us the best opportunity to get the vehicles in for the best cost.

171
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:35,385
And at the end of the five-year lease, the trade in for to upgrade the vehicles is better than if you do a three-year lease.

172
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:45,514
I'll live with a three-year lease if I have to, but I think that without that security and that knowledge moving forward, it makes it hard for me to budget to the future.

173
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:47,716
Three years just isn't long enough.

174
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:52,360
And the payback for a three-year lease to the city is not a good one.

175
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:53,241
Thank you.

176
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:56,064
Any questions on agreement when?

177
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:04,777
Mister president Mister president I will say this it's not uncommon for this council to have granted the administration the authority to enter into a contract.

178
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:09,259
Outside of the maximum 36 month as outlined in state law.

179
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:18,964
We did it previously when we implemented the parking program and I certainly don't see any reason why we should do it now I certainly would support this measure this evening.

180
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:19,284
Some are all.

181
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:21,262
Thank you, Mr. President.

182
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:22,504
Thank you, Faye, for that.

183
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:26,089
I see Newton listed in this presentation.

184
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,454
Did you use the same enterprise program in Newton?

185
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,117
No, I didn't have to.

186
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:33,140
We had the budget to buy.

187
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:38,875
And I'm not trying to make you Newton or compare you to Newton.

188
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:44,557
I'm evaluating what you have, what you need, and what you can afford to do in this moment in time.

189
00:13:44,577 --> 00:13:49,719
Because as you know, I'm working on a deadline and I need to roll this in quickly.

190
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,481
If you can give me $500,000, I wouldn't do the least, but I know that's not gonna happen.

191
00:13:55,901 --> 00:14:01,843
So I'm just being realistic and coming to you with the best case scenario after six weeks of evaluating what you have here.

192
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:03,347
Absolutely, and I appreciate that.

193
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:07,328
You talked about the two trucks needed, what are the trucks needed for?

194
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:12,229
You have to have trucks with a lift in order to collect the money.

195
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,110
Okay.

196
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:25,693
There's canisters that come out of those machines that are very heavy, and I suspect it's why the van that Reef Parking has is probably in disrepair because it doesn't really have the suspension to take that weight.

197
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:32,741
So you know, you've got about $2,000 per container, you've got 78 machines, that gets heavy really quick.

198
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:35,404
So you need a vehicle that will last.

199
00:14:35,464 --> 00:14:38,888
I don't want something that's going to be over in your garage every five minutes.

200
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:39,709
Okay, great.

201
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:40,049
Thank you.

202
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:44,535
And are there options within this contract for like EV vehicles or hybrids?

203
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,487
Actually, I did choose one hybrid.

204
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:56,295
There was a total EV, which I obviously would have chosen, because as much as you can go EV, it's better.

205
00:14:57,056 --> 00:15:06,667
But the sellback rate on that particular one that we could get at this time, understanding that getting cars is very difficult, which is why I need to move this before I can't get them.

206
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:10,009
was not a good buyback at this time.

207
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:17,633
So the hybrid, I got $10,000 more than for just the straight EV because of the size of the EV that I could get at this time.

208
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:22,856
Hopefully, as I go to upgrade, we can do better as we move forward.

209
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:27,018
But right now, the fear is we won't, you know, it's hard to get vehicles now.

210
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:29,099
It just really is because of the chip and everything.

211
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:30,128
Great.

212
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:30,428
Thank you.

213
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:34,972
That's, that's all the questions I have for now.

214
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:37,154
I'm very appreciative of your, of your quick work on this.

215
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:40,997
That's all I have right now, Mr. President.

216
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:43,899
Thank you, Mr. President.

217
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:44,659
Welcome to Medford.

218
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:45,280
Thank you.

219
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,000
Great to have you on board.

220
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:47,882
Just a couple of quick questions.

221
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:51,004
So you mentioned about the budget.

222
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:54,367
So when I look at the budget book, I know that there's a,

223
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:56,206
is a total of $350,601.

224
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,588
Maybe a little less by now.

225
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,248
I'm sorry?

226
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,489
Maybe a little less by now.

227
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:05,271
I couldn't hear you.

228
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:09,093
I said maybe a little less by now because I have started to purchase some things.

229
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:09,853
I completely understand.

230
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:10,814
That's fine.

231
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:15,376
So the $100,000 for supplies, what's that going to be used on if it's not vehicles, I guess?

232
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:24,964
It'll be used on office supplies, I still have to get out a whole office I don't have a desk, a chair, paper, a pen, I have nothing, zero.

233
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:37,798
I need to probably provide some kind of consistent clothing for the employees, some kind of uniform, a shirt with the city logo, a jacket, because these positions are not union.

234
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:40,480
in the union positions, they get a clothing allowance.

235
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,202
They don't get them at this point.

236
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:43,783
Now I'm, I'm not crazy.

237
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:49,268
I know eventually the union may come for these employees, but for right now that I need to accommodate for that.

238
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:55,954
And as far as the, so what's the, do you know what the cost difference is between a three year lease and a five year lease?

239
00:16:58,028 --> 00:17:00,549
I don't know, I don't think there's any cost difference.

240
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:06,151
The difference is when it's time to trade it in, that's where the difference comes in between a three and a five year lease.

241
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:08,872
The car isn't cheaper because you use a three year lease.

242
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:14,675
It's just, there's less money to roll over into purchasing the next vehicle or leasing the next vehicle.

243
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:22,838
And as far as the two vehicles that we're getting back from Republic to the 2014 and 2016, do you know if they have a,

244
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,140
A ton of miles on those.

245
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,221
So I knew you were going to ask that question.

246
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:31,223
Those are questions I've been trying to get answered.

247
00:17:31,763 --> 00:17:32,484
I don't know.

248
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:50,277
Even when they brought the vehicle over here, and I'm trying to be diplomatic here because we are still in the process of doing a transition with REEF, because the vehicle wasn't working properly and it has an electronic reader for the mileage, I still don't know what the mileage is.

249
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,458
They won't give you the mileage?

250
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:56,435
I don't know if they know, but I can't physically even see it when I'm in the vehicle.

251
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:06,121
Because that part of the vehicle where it's electronically shows you the mileage is not functioning.

252
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:10,003
It just says check engine.

253
00:18:10,384 --> 00:18:13,345
It is a problem, which is why I'm here before you tonight.

254
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:14,742
Thank you.

255
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:16,184
Those are not reliable.

256
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:24,494
I don't want to start and then have to come before you and say, you know, we're not collecting, we're not doing any enforcing because the vehicle's not working.

257
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:27,598
I have no further questions at this point.

258
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:28,099
Thank you.

259
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,840
Thank you.

260
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:29,918
Ms.

261
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:32,439
Bonson, I got a question on the cars.

262
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,499
And Faye is fine.

263
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:38,720
I'm fine with Faye.

264
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I'll call you counselors.

265
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:44,641
I see them driving around with newer cars doing work.

266
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:47,122
So do we own those cars that they have now?

267
00:18:47,602 --> 00:18:51,223
The only inventory list that I got for vehicles for you

268
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:56,028
is a 2014 Nissan and a 2016 RAV4.

269
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,912
Those are the only vehicles on the list to be turned over to the city.

270
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:01,155
So what are the cars that they're driving around with now?

271
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:02,556
That I can't tell you.

272
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:10,146
Okay, well they are driving around with cars, so I think maybe you should look into the cars that maybe we paid for.

273
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:23,403
I have been trying to look into a lot of things that you have paid for, and as I've said, until we sit down and meet face-to-face, I think it's going to be difficult for me to answer too many of the questions of that type tonight.

274
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:25,844
Yeah, because they're driving along with coveted readers.

275
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:32,066
Well, all I can take is when I started this job, there were things set on my desk, and one of them was a list of assets.

276
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:37,951
that Reef Republic says belong to us and will be turned over to us at the end of this contract.

277
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:41,674
And those two vehicles are the only two things on that list.

278
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:43,475
Okay, thank you.

279
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,497
Any further, Councilor Mox.

280
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,440
Thank you, Mr. President, and Faye, I wanna welcome you to the city of Memphis.

281
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,341
Thank you very much.

282
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:53,824
You have a very large endeavor before you.

283
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:54,485
Sure.

284
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:55,545
And I wish you well.

285
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:56,466
Thank you very much.

286
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:00,160
The question I have, the first one is very basic.

287
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:08,161
When do we anticipate for the city of Method to officially take over parking responsibilities?

288
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:15,023
Well, again, that's a difficult question to answer until I meet with Reef Republic, and we don't meet till Monday.

289
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:21,924
So we don't have when this contract, because it was a 10-year contract.

290
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:24,405
A seven-year, I believe, is what I've seen.

291
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:31,120
The way I understand it was the 10-year with at year seven, the option to renew for three years.

292
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:37,510
Okay, with all due respect, what I've read does not, there's nothing in there that says anything about an option.

293
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,913
What I've seen is a motion for a 10-year,

294
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:45,579
and that motion was denied and then a vote was taken to agree to seven years.

295
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:54,648
I haven't seen anything in your contract so I'm not a contract expert but I did read it and I've gone over it with legal and I don't see anything about an extension.

296
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:58,192
Okay my understanding is that it was a 10-year contract with a

297
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:02,573
option to renew on year seven, which we're at right now at the end of December.

298
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:07,494
So the contract, as far as I know, ends January 1st, 2022.

299
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:09,935
January 6th, 2022.

300
00:21:11,155 --> 00:21:09,935
2022.

301
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:22,358
So is it safe to say that they will no longer be providing any type of resident permit parking or business enforcement as of January 6th, 2022?

302
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:24,899
I can't answer that question right now.

303
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:32,682
Okay, so we don't officially know when the city is going to take this over.

304
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:41,228
According to the contract, it would be January 6th, but there may be some transition stuff that we need to do.

305
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:48,352
I mean, as I have said, when I came before you, I don't have a system in place to take any of this on.

306
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:57,256
So depending on what happens tonight, then I will have to go back to GTechNA and see how quickly that system can be developed and come on board.

307
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:59,837
I can't answer that until we walk through this.

308
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:00,821
Right.

309
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:02,602
And I appreciate it.

310
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:03,762
I know you've only been here six weeks.

311
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:04,723
So that's correct.

312
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:07,024
And I'm giving you an honest answer.

313
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:14,247
I'm really not trying to be evasive with you, but you're asking me a question I can't answer because I need to take the other steps first.

314
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,808
And one of them is this step.

315
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:16,108
Right.

316
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:23,811
So just a point of information that on the last contract, that happened to be part of the last contract.

317
00:22:24,572 --> 00:22:34,196
And when we were presented with the contract, it was then Mayor McGlynn at the time, he asked us, I believe it was a 10 year contract, but if you say seven.

318
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:36,037
It is seven.

319
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:36,957
That's fine too.

320
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:45,401
And the one, honestly, one regret I have in public office for all the years I've served,

321
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:57,130
was the fact that I voted on that contract prior to knowing, let me just say, prior to knowing what the actual program rollout was gonna be.

322
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:20,882
And if I had the hindsight before I took the vote, knowing that the mayor was going to do kiosk on the streets, and the mayor wasn't gonna take it in-house, and the mayor was gonna do a number of things that were outside of the original recommendations by the committee that he formed, I wouldn't have voted on the actual terms of the contract.

323
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:31,391
And I think what we're facing here again tonight, to be quite frank, is the administration coming to us saying that they're allowed to do a three-year contract on their own.

324
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:41,637
They don't need the approval of the Memphis City Council, but we wanna extend it to five years because it makes more financial sense to do that.

325
00:23:42,117 --> 00:23:44,118
And I don't doubt that, and I don't question that.

326
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:51,142
What I do question is that the longer we extend the contract, the longer this council

327
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:57,158
will be saddled with a program that- Excuse me, excuse me.

328
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:01,403
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but saddled, I think is a little unfair.

329
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:05,068
I have no intention of saddling you with anything.

330
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:06,730
I'm gonna provide you with the best.

331
00:24:09,153 --> 00:24:13,455
the best system that I know exists out there in the industry today.

332
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:17,017
I understand that you got burned by this contract.

333
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:18,898
I don't wanna be judged by it.

334
00:24:19,118 --> 00:24:19,578
I read it.

335
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:21,619
I can't believe you signed it either.

336
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,741
It's very, it leaves you nothing to protect yourselves.

337
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:29,443
But that's not what I'm entering into with the people that I'm dealing with.

338
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:32,124
Because this, I'm dealing with people who have been in the industry.

339
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:35,286
They wanna keep their reputation and I would like to keep mine.

340
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:43,518
So I'm not here, I don't know what happened seven years ago, I wasn't here, but that's not what's happening now.

341
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:50,663
What I need is legitimate, and the contracts that I'll put before you will be solid and informational and cross all the T's.

342
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,384
And I don't doubt that for a second, Faye.

343
00:24:53,064 --> 00:25:04,532
I guess what I'm trying to say is that we really don't know, other than the two contracts that you're asking us to approve tonight, we really don't know what this parking program consists of.

344
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:15,160
other than the fact that we did receive a report back so many months ago from the Parking Policy and Enforcement Commission who did Yeoman's work.

345
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,582
I know there's a couple of the co-chairs.

346
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:22,785
Jim Silver is in the audience, Mari Carroll, and they did Yeoman's work putting together a report.

347
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:28,648
So in many of the recommendations, they put together a laundry list of recommendations.

348
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:55,330
So I just want to caution my fellow colleagues that a vote on this tonight, asking for a five-year contract, the vehicle end of it may be a little different because it's strictly vehicles, but the agreement number two, which deals with the management system, hardware, enforcement money, and so forth, really gets into the nuts and bolts of how to run a program.

349
00:25:56,467 --> 00:26:09,396
And I've been down this avenue once before, and I just want to caution my colleagues that I think we're going down this avenue again prematurely, even though you need this to take place to move forward.

350
00:26:09,697 --> 00:26:11,178
I understand your position.

351
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:22,060
from my standpoint as someone that fielded the calls and someone that ultimately had some responsibility in the last program as someone that voted for the contract.

352
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:28,402
I regret doing so because of the many things that I did not support in the rollout.

353
00:26:29,222 --> 00:26:41,605
And it's unfortunate that you have to vote for this and then hope that you are in line with the rollout because you may be in total disagreement with the rollout, but then your name is going to get associated with

354
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:42,943
Well, you supported it.

355
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:46,968
So I just want to caution my colleagues on that.

356
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:51,874
And, you know, they'll do what they like, but I just want to caution them on that.

357
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:56,019
Fay, I don't expect you to answer this, but

358
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,981
Oh, maybe you can.

359
00:26:59,962 --> 00:27:09,729
As Councilor Falco mentioned, there were $350,000 put in last year's budget for the creation of a parking management program in the city.

360
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:12,491
Actually that funding is just for payroll.

361
00:27:15,894 --> 00:27:18,496
The 350,000, I believe it's just for payroll.

362
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:25,467
Point of information, Councilor Fevella.

363
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:28,531
I have a personnel expenses, $250,601 and parking enforcement supplies, $100,000.

364
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:31,774
So it's $100,000 in supplies.

365
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:34,137
Okay, that may be correct.

366
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:38,021
Right, so- No, no, I don't mistrust you.

367
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,604
I just know what I need for payroll, I guess.

368
00:27:40,844 --> 00:27:41,005
Right.

369
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:58,406
So during the budget deliberations, I asked the then Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez, was this figure of 350,000 just a placeholder, or do you really think you can run a parking program in the city of this size?

370
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:11,559
with 900 and I think it's 87 business meters and hundreds of permit parking streets, which someday may go up to the full number of 750 odd streets that we have.

371
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:15,160
Do you feel he could run a full fledged program?

372
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,561
And he unequivocally said no.

373
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:19,662
And this was a starting point.

374
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:27,445
Knowing we're already six months into the fiscal year, what would you envision

375
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:31,963
a full-fledged parking program cost in this community.

376
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:35,194
Given that any thought, do you have any idea?

377
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,715
No, I have not given that any thought.

378
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:42,158
I don't think anyone could answer that question today without actually having a functioning system going.

379
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:45,780
The only thing I've been able to give thought to is getting you started.

380
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,401
You don't, again, I will say, I don't have office space.

381
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:50,562
I don't have a pen.

382
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:51,963
I don't have a staff.

383
00:28:52,243 --> 00:28:53,484
I don't have a car.

384
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:55,365
Okay, so that's where I have to start.

385
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:57,246
You can't build a house from the top down.

386
00:28:57,286 --> 00:28:58,526
I gotta build it from the bottom up.

387
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:01,688
Right, right, but again, from an administrative standpoint,

388
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:17,166
If I were gonna say, you know what, we're gonna take parking in-house and we're gonna do it in-house moving forward January 6th, you would think you would have an idea of an actual cost.

389
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:21,968
You think you would have an idea, is this program something that's self-sustaining?

390
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:26,349
Could the city run this program based on the revenue they bring in?

391
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:30,344
you know, what the actual cost may be.

392
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:38,406
So I think it's hard for me to understand that the mayor said, you know what, we're moving forward with the parking program in the city of Method.

393
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:42,267
I just have no idea how much it's gonna cost.

394
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:43,787
I have no idea.

395
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:51,729
Once we have more information from Reef Parking, which I hope we are able to get on Monday, I'll have a better idea of what their operational monies have been.

396
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:52,487
Right, right.

397
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:54,308
And you've been on board for six weeks.

398
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:56,929
This has been in process for almost two years.

399
00:29:57,609 --> 00:29:59,650
So just so you know, this has been in process.

400
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,471
I know you've only been here a month and a half, but this has been in process for almost two years.

401
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:13,534
And the report was issued by the commission that the mayor put forward almost nine months ago with a lot of different recommendations.

402
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:18,416
I'm just a little troubled at this point that we don't know when the program may start.

403
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:21,577
I mean, we're three weeks before the contract

404
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:23,557
four weeks before it's gonna end.

405
00:30:23,898 --> 00:30:25,139
We don't know when it's gonna start.

406
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,762
We don't have a plan to roll out the program as of yet.

407
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:32,945
We don't know what the actual costs may be.

408
00:30:33,586 --> 00:30:35,127
So it may be cost prohibitive.

409
00:30:35,587 --> 00:30:38,430
Maybe if we looked at this six months ago.

410
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,851
I'm sorry to interrupt you again.

411
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:40,792
If I could just finish.

412
00:30:40,912 --> 00:30:45,936
Okay, but there's no way that anything I could do could be cost prohibitive compared to what you have.

413
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:50,169
Okay, well, I'm just saying, we don't know that.

414
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:54,590
I do, I'm telling you after looking over some of the things, I can tell you that that's true.

415
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:01,612
You couldn't tell me when the program's gonna start, you couldn't tell me what's gonna cost, but now you're sure of that it's not gonna cost labor.

416
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,352
I could just finish.

417
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:04,673
Well, you asked a question I'm trying to answer.

418
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:05,993
That wasn't a question, I'm speaking.

419
00:31:06,253 --> 00:31:06,553
Okay.

420
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:10,614
And I'd appreciate it if I have the ability to finish my comments.

421
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:11,034
Sure, sure.

422
00:31:11,054 --> 00:31:13,655
Because it throws my comments off when I get,

423
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:14,555
interrupted.

424
00:31:15,016 --> 00:31:17,817
And I appreciate that.

425
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:29,843
So I guess the concern I have at this particular point is that we're moving forward on a parking program that residents have been accustomed to for the past seven years.

426
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:45,275
And come January 6th, Mr. President, there's no one behind this rail that's gonna be able to tell any resident or any business owner that currently gets enforcement that that enforcement is gonna be continued.

427
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:48,656
There's not one person behind this rail that can state that.

428
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:54,259
And that is a real concern of mine at this particular point, Mr. President.

429
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,383
So I want to make that known.

430
00:31:57,723 --> 00:32:08,746
I want to make it known back in the budget, when I brought it before the chief of staff at that point, that we weren't fully funding this program and that we were setting it up for failure at the time.

431
00:32:09,646 --> 00:32:11,086
He said it was only a placeholder.

432
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:22,770
So I just want to let that be known too, Mr. President, that there was an ample funding in the budget, even for a six month program, if we start in January.

433
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,732
The other point, Mr. President, I want to raise is the Parking Policy and Enforcement Commission.

434
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:39,117
Their report that was issued to the mayor in March, and I believe formally came out in April, came out with a laundry list of recommendations.

435
00:32:39,855 --> 00:32:43,658
Section 2.1 had a laundry list summary of recommendations.

436
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:58,892
And some of the recommendations that were made by this commission over the last nine months, I think should have been at least reviewed by the administration and potentially worked on by the administration.

437
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:15,210
And I'm not sure if Faith can speak to any of this tonight, and I don't expect you to, but there were a number of recommendations, Mr. President, that spoke about GLX parking recommendations in the Hillside and South Method area.

438
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:22,637
that the city should be working on, including business parking as well in that area.

439
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:25,340
Pursuing meters, not kiosks.

440
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:34,768
The commission recommended a cost-benefit analysis on refurbishing the kiosk, replacing kiosks, or investing in new meters.

441
00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:52,320
Now, over the last nine months, I assume some of that work could have taken place, and I'm not sure if it did or didn't, but I'd like to hear from the administration over the last nine months if any of these recommendations were actually worked on

442
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,521
that were put forth by the mayor's commission on parking policy and enforcement.

443
00:33:57,141 --> 00:33:59,221
There was another recommendation, Mr. President.

444
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:04,502
As we all know, Meffitt has 31% of our roads are private ways.

445
00:34:05,422 --> 00:34:20,545
And a private way is the city is empowered to enforce safety violations like hydrants and handicap spots, but otherwise not permitted to enforce parking on private ways.

446
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:33,319
So if you have a third of the roads that the city can't do enforcement on, those residents deserve some type of plan before this gets rolled out.

447
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:40,147
They also deserve the right to be at the table to make sure their concerns are heard, Mr. President.

448
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:59,376
The recommendations that were offered by the commission, bullet six under 2.1, was to create a communication plan for residents living on private ways to clearly outline the city's traffic and parking safety enforcement responsibilities.

449
00:35:00,576 --> 00:35:08,098
So based on the GLX parking recommendations for the hillside assault method and the businesses in that district,

450
00:35:09,945 --> 00:35:14,977
Whether or not the city was going to pursue the meters or kiosks, fix the existing ones,

451
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:30,394
replaced existing ones or add new meters, and then the creation of a communication plan for residents living on private ways, I think are very important items that this administration has nine months to take a look at.

452
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:43,361
And Faye, I don't know if you are familiar with that or if the interim chief of staff is familiar, but I'd like to know if there's been any action on the commission's recommendations.

453
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:47,268
Thank you, Mr. President.

454
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:49,149
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

455
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:50,350
These are good questions.

456
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,811
We have been meeting on this matter.

457
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:58,275
In the time that I've been here, we've been meeting regularly on the subject of the items you brought up.

458
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:03,338
We talked about kiosks, we talked about the GLX parking, we talked about private ways.

459
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,524
We've been further meeting on this matter with Faye.

460
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,486
We're bringing her expertise into house.

461
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:19,292
Prior to Faye coming on board, there were discussions with the police chief, the lieutenant in the police department or sergeant.

462
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:22,295
I keep confusing whether he was Hartnett, that is.

463
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:24,196
Thank you, thank you.

464
00:36:25,877 --> 00:36:32,921
and also the Traffic and Transportation Engineer, the Director of Traffic and Transportation.

465
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:45,329
And we've also been discussing policies, you know, that this whole process is one that is to be reviewed, obviously, and is to be considered and discussed in the report that was completed.

466
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:48,717
to be taken and reviewed thoroughly further.

467
00:36:48,737 --> 00:37:01,468
We need the expertise from Faye to bring on and refine the discussions that have taken place to ensure that we can roll them out and we have somebody who's knowledgeable on that rollout process.

468
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:16,315
I will also say that there is a community meeting tomorrow evening on the subject of parking and I would encourage all the counselors to attend or to watch the community meeting after and send any of your questions to us so that we can try to answer them to the best of our ability.

469
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:25,479
As Faye has stated, obviously a tremendous part of her time has gone into learning about the contract.

470
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,280
And that's a particularly

471
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:45,567
challenging piece because the city, and I will say it's something that since we're in a contract with a vendor, it's important for me to be thoughtful of my words here tonight.

472
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:49,350
And I'm going to be extremely thoughtful of the words that I use.

473
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:57,595
I don't want to speak ill of the contractor who has held this contract, but obviously we weren't happy.

474
00:37:58,115 --> 00:37:59,836
We're moving away from that contract.

475
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:08,641
Faye has done a tremendous job pulling information out so that we know what steps we need to take and that we have the proper plan to move forward.

476
00:38:09,462 --> 00:38:11,143
And a lot of her time has been

477
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,025
filled with doing that task.

478
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:26,794
And as was discussed with the vehicle, part of that has been, I mean, I've been on exchanges with Faye where she's asked to have an appointment to see that vehicle that was described as not having the odometer.

479
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:29,716
An appointment was scheduled to see that vehicle.

480
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:31,918
That appointment was canceled because it was still in the shop.

481
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:35,061
And then another appointment was scheduled and then that appointment was canceled.

482
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:40,525
And then finally the vehicle came over and she observed a number of concerning issues with that vehicle.

483
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,862
This is a different scenario.

484
00:38:43,962 --> 00:38:48,667
As far as the five-year contract, I'd just like to touch on that too, Mr. President, Councilor Marks.

485
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,508
This is a very different scenario.

486
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:59,657
We have a parking director who's going to manage and oversee a contract, which is critical in this process and is a major part of the success of a contract.

487
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:06,020
So I would encourage you all to consider please approving both five-year requests.

488
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:23,806
Obviously, as Faye has stated, we'll make do with whatever the scenario, but this is based on the recommendation of a professional who's been doing this type of work for at least five, if not many more years, suited with all the other experience she has in management and also in policymaking.

489
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:28,308
So I encourage you to consider all that when you vote this evening.

490
00:39:28,748 --> 00:39:28,988
Thank you.

491
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,181
So Mr. President, and thank you for your comments.

492
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:33,001
I appreciate that.

493
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:42,964
Currently right now, the parking enforcement office does not handle every street for permit parking.

494
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:44,505
We don't have citywide permit parking.

495
00:39:45,265 --> 00:39:54,828
So it's my understanding and members of the commissioner here, but their recommendation was to look into citywide permit parking.

496
00:39:55,788 --> 00:39:55,928
And,

497
00:39:58,214 --> 00:40:02,787
You know what we're asking now is to have Faye.

498
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:32,617
and her team, which is Faye, right, it's Faye, to expand from a model that is already established, that already has a manager, underlings that do the enforcement, underlings that do the maintenance of the machines, systems already set up, and now we're asking Faye to take over a whole system and also increase the system by adding more than half the city.

499
00:40:32,943 --> 00:40:33,123
Right.

500
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:40,151
So, so phase, not going to do what Park Methods doing phase going to do almost double the parking enforcement.

501
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:44,336
If we go citywide permit parking, then what currently exists right now.

502
00:40:45,322 --> 00:40:53,404
Also, when we rolled out the plan back so many years ago, it was somewhat of a pilot program because we only did certain business districts.

503
00:40:53,984 --> 00:41:04,447
How do you start parking enforcement and say, okay, for West Method, we're gonna enforce, but certain parts of Salem Street, we're not gonna enforce the business districts.

504
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:12,229
And we're gonna allow people to park in front of your business with no fear of getting a ticket, because there's no meters, but this other business,

505
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:17,337
You know, they may lose potential business because they have meters.

506
00:41:17,818 --> 00:41:22,903
So it was never rolled out fairly in my opinion, and it was only partly rolled out.

507
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:30,511
Now we're going to ask, because I assume this is going to be rolled out citywide, now we're going to ask Faye and her team of Faye.

508
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:34,694
to roll out business parking citywide.

509
00:41:35,234 --> 00:41:43,620
So we're gonna almost double the work again, or maybe close to it, on doing business parking enforcement.

510
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:52,105
So I think what we're doing right now is adding a lot more to face plate than even our current vendor had on their plate.

511
00:41:53,706 --> 00:41:56,707
And I don't think it's realistic at this particular point.

512
00:41:57,528 --> 00:42:00,570
I don't understand how we're gonna get a program off and running.

513
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:16,300
My layman's opinion, Fay, you have a lot more experience, but my layman's opinion, to get a program like this up and running in the community at the current capacity, to take it in-house, I think you'd be talking three, four, five months to get it up and running.

514
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:18,962
a full-fledged program, my own opinion.

515
00:42:19,423 --> 00:42:20,543
You can tell me otherwise.

516
00:42:21,684 --> 00:42:39,455
Also, Mr. President, as part of the recommendations by the commission, they brought up a valid point that Councilor Scott Pelley brought up some while back, and it was regarding outstanding money owed to Park Method and the community.

517
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:57,122
And one of the recommendations under 2.1 bullet three was to pursue action as allowed in the contract with Republic Parking to collect the $1.6 to $2 million outstanding parking fees owed to park method program.

518
00:42:58,178 --> 00:43:06,446
And bullet point four was for the city to work to collect a minimum of 50% of the outstanding fees owed to PAC method.

519
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:07,006
Why?

520
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:10,349
Because it's in the city's best interest to collect those fees.

521
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:20,999
Has there been any movement on the collection of these fees over the past nine months since the recommendation of the commission?

522
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:23,141
Mr. President.

523
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:24,338
Thank you.

524
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:25,199
Councilor Marks.

525
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:38,291
So to go back to your first item regarding private streets and the process, the expansion of the work, so to speak, as you described it, I can tell you that it is not just Faye.

526
00:43:38,531 --> 00:43:47,620
While Faye is taking the lead and Faye is responsible for the department, Faye is also a part of a team and Faye relies, and I encourage Faye to

527
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:57,758
jump in if there's anything she'd like to add to this, but Faye is part of a team that consists of myself, the mayor, the police chief,

528
00:44:00,128 --> 00:44:10,113
yes, the parking direct, the transportation and traffic and transportation director, our communication staff, our treasurer collector.

529
00:44:11,093 --> 00:44:12,774
We have regular meetings with these groups.

530
00:44:12,894 --> 00:44:28,221
In addition to that, Faye, as she mentioned at the start of this meeting, we're going through a process and before you tonight will also be a number of CAF approval requests to approve the position in the CAF system for

531
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,382
positions in the parking department.

532
00:44:30,942 --> 00:44:38,105
So it's actually a pretty large team, and I think one that is providing the support, and I know Fay would be the first to tell me if it wasn't.

533
00:44:38,985 --> 00:44:55,092
As far as the process for four to five months, I think it's really important to say here that on a comment that you had made, Councilor Marks, about the funding and sustainability of this department, part of it is because in order for us to determine the cost,

534
00:44:55,912 --> 00:44:58,713
We have to know what the policies are going to be right.

535
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:08,835
So if we're going to change the policies, to your point with if we're going to expand to include private streets, then in fact that's going to have an impact on the budget.

536
00:45:09,075 --> 00:45:16,037
And so, Vice President night traffic policies established the traffic commission not the administration so the traffic policies already been established.

537
00:45:18,023 --> 00:45:31,386
So the only thing I would say about that is all of these aspects, whether it be private streets, the Traffic Commission, those are the types of things that we are having regular discussions on, and they're ones that are legal questions that we're exploring.

538
00:45:31,926 --> 00:45:39,668
So it's a critical part of the process to determine what the legality is of enforcing on private ways, which is a discussion we've already broached.

539
00:45:40,128 --> 00:45:51,278
on a number of circumstances and one that our Director of Traffic and Transportation reminds us of regularly, and the Police Chief reminds us of regularly, obviously two members of the Traffic Commission.

540
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:55,322
Well, one member of the Traffic Commission and one support staff to the Traffic Commission.

541
00:45:56,183 --> 00:46:01,248
So, you know, as far as this process is concerned, it takes an incredible effort

542
00:46:02,711 --> 00:46:12,257
to review not only the operation, how to operate the department, but also the policies that could affect the costs of that operation to ultimately serve the community.

543
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:22,743
And that's why we're not able to provide a comprehensive estimate of what the program's gonna look like, because part of those policies still need to be worked on and developed.

544
00:46:22,803 --> 00:46:26,005
And part of that's because we need some community input too.

545
00:46:26,185 --> 00:46:30,448
We had said from the beginning, I understand, that we're gonna have community meetings on this subject.

546
00:46:31,248 --> 00:46:39,753
And in order to get feedback from the community and build good policies, good communication with the community, we have to be able to have those meetings and chart the course.

547
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,754
And that's what all the things that are being worked on at this time.

548
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:44,335
Thank you.

549
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:49,378
I just want to, Mr. President, maybe just add one more thing to hopefully put Mr. Marks at ease.

550
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:55,081
The previous universe that I oversaw is probably three times bigger than what you have here.

551
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,422
Our permit program,

552
00:46:57,834 --> 00:47:03,382
is was definitely four or five times bigger than yours with the proper staff will be fine.

553
00:47:03,563 --> 00:47:07,308
And you're right, it will, it may take time to ramp up for it to be perfection.

554
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:09,551
But I don't think that anyone

555
00:47:10,524 --> 00:47:15,729
realistically assumed that after me being here six weeks that you were going to have a full-fledged parking program.

556
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:18,211
You've gone seven years into this process.

557
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:22,715
There's no way in seven weeks I can walk you out of it, but I can walk you out of it.

558
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:24,116
And that's all I can tell you.

559
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:27,980
You're asking for absolutes and timelines and I can't give you that today.

560
00:47:32,223 --> 00:47:44,148
know what's been discussed and also to know that if we're talking about transitioning from one to another, there's been no transition happening.

561
00:47:45,168 --> 00:47:53,432
And, you know, to be here three or four weeks, and I'm not saying you Faye, so don't take this personally, but to come before us three or four weeks before

562
00:47:54,508 --> 00:48:01,249
we're supposed to start a new program and have all these unanswered questions, I think is being disingenuous.

563
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:08,291
Because this work should have been taking place over the last nine months to a year, to be quite honest with you.

564
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:12,111
This work should have been really undertaken during that process.

565
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:15,912
And now is when you come before us saying, this is what we plan on doing.

566
00:48:16,192 --> 00:48:17,472
This is what the costs will be.

567
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:19,833
This is when we plan on taking the program over.

568
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:24,676
I understand you've been here six weeks, but I'm not hearing any of that.

569
00:48:25,457 --> 00:48:37,788
And I just want to make sure that we're not setting ourselves up for failure come January 6th, when people expect a small transition to the city enforcement, because that's what they've been hearing.

570
00:48:38,088 --> 00:48:40,110
The city's going to undertake the enforcement.

571
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,071
We're taking it in-house.

572
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:56,600
And when that transition doesn't happen and it's not smooth, I think people are gonna be concerned and members of the council are gonna feel the phone calls and say, well, you supported this program, you voted for the contract, why did you allow this, this and this?

573
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:07,847
And I just wanna make sure, I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer, but I wanna make sure that the residents of this community are well aware when this will take place

574
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:10,236
how it will take place.

575
00:49:10,676 --> 00:49:15,518
And you talk about in community involvement, it's three weeks prior to this going live.

576
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:26,364
I mean, even if you got community involvement, you know, are you gonna take the recommendations from the community or is it just to say we had a community meeting?

577
00:49:27,245 --> 00:49:37,650
And I know that's not the case, but it seems to me sometimes, you know, you have a community meeting just to have a community meeting and say, well, we did that, we done that, we solicited input.

578
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:57,803
So in order to have meaningful input and having business owners, the chamber, and other vested interests in the community be part of the conversation and able to affect change, I don't think the leeway and time given is enough, to be quite honest with you.

579
00:49:58,324 --> 00:49:59,144
I don't think it's enough.

580
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:01,385
I think this should have started many months ago.

581
00:50:04,226 --> 00:50:15,369
You know, I wish the program well, but I don't see it happening, Mr. President, come January 6th or even several months after January 6th.

582
00:50:15,729 --> 00:50:23,432
And I think there's a lot of questions that were posed or recommendations by the Enforcement Commission that was appointed by the mayor.

583
00:50:24,252 --> 00:50:38,450
that really haven't been properly vetted, haven't been properly looked at, and in my opinion, sets us back even further in getting a full-fledged parking program in this community.

584
00:50:40,312 --> 00:50:41,153
Thank you, Mr. President.

585
00:50:41,173 --> 00:50:43,875
I want to thank... I just want to... I'm not critical of you.

586
00:50:44,395 --> 00:50:51,621
I wish you well, but there are a lot of things that I think led up to this moment and where we're at right now.

587
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:58,246
And there's so many unknowns right now, and I think there should be more of an indication on a path

588
00:50:58,884 --> 00:51:02,548
in a general direction and something to look at and say, this is what we believe.

589
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:04,169
We're going to go to meters now.

590
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:05,631
We don't like the kiosk.

591
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:07,032
We're taking it in-house.

592
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:10,055
We're doing zone parking.

593
00:51:10,336 --> 00:51:11,036
We're doing this.

594
00:51:11,537 --> 00:51:14,300
I think there should have been more of a plan presented.

595
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,981
before you come to the council and say, we want an extension of the contract.

596
00:51:20,081 --> 00:51:21,501
We want more than three years.

597
00:51:21,841 --> 00:51:27,283
So if you set up a program that I'm not proud of, why would I want to give you five years?

598
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,243
Why would I want to give you 10 years on that program?

599
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:31,123
I want to give you the least amount of years.

600
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,024
And the state allows you to do three years on your own.

601
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:35,704
Why would I want to extend that?

602
00:51:36,264 --> 00:51:43,326
So to me, I think we're safer as a council saying, take the three years that you have the option without a vote on the council.

603
00:51:44,206 --> 00:51:53,251
And then in a few years, come back and we'll take a look at it and see how successful what has been offered policies and procedures and how this is working.

604
00:51:53,671 --> 00:51:56,853
And then maybe you go for five or 10 year plan after that.

605
00:51:57,253 --> 00:52:00,475
So that would be my recommendation to members of this council.

606
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:02,196
Thank you, Mr. President for indulging.

607
00:52:02,256 --> 00:52:02,576
Thank you.

608
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,218
I think we've got a little bit of track on this.

609
00:52:06,438 --> 00:52:13,042
I think a lot of council's Mark's questions and concerns, I think would probably be better held in a

610
00:52:13,468 --> 00:52:14,228
Committee of the whole.

611
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:20,490
So but council's got the yeah, I mean come from a does a couple as question.

612
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,111
Thank you very much Mister president.

613
00:52:22,651 --> 00:52:26,632
You know the way look at that that this whole situation is this ultimately.

614
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:35,134
I think everybody by in this real wants parking enforcement in this community we've all called for it at one point or another saying we need parking enforcement in this community.

615
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:40,496
8 years ago when there was no contract we all called for parking enforcement we said we want a parking enforcement.

616
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,763
I think we all continue to want parking enforcement.

617
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:48,871
I think we all agree.

618
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,400
Oh, you can, I'm sorry.

619
00:52:53,861 --> 00:52:57,543
I don't want to poison anybody to death over here with all these new rules they're making up.

620
00:52:58,183 --> 00:53:03,286
I think we can all agree that we need vehicles to conduct the parking enforcement.

621
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:08,989
I think we can all agree that we also need financial data management systems to conduct parking enforcement.

622
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:18,055
So the real question before us is whether or not, if we're gonna conduct parking enforcement, whether or not we're gonna allow a contract to be three years or five years.

623
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:25,850
If we're doing parking enforcement for one year, two years, three years, or five years, we're still going to need these mechanisms in place to conduct this performance.

624
00:53:27,012 --> 00:53:27,653
We're still going to need

625
00:53:28,228 --> 00:53:31,110
vehicles to do it, we're still going to need data management systems to do it.

626
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:37,415
So if that's the case, and we can get more bang for our buck in a five-year contract, I think that that's something we should support.

627
00:53:37,435 --> 00:53:45,461
You know, when it comes down to the rollout of the plan and how the plan's supposed to work, I mean, that's a function of the administration, right?

628
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:49,925
That's the executive branch's duty and job, to roll out the plan appropriately with the legislative body.

629
00:53:50,485 --> 00:53:59,394
And the state legislature and the state law calls for us to take a vote to authorize the administration as to whether or not we should allow them to enter on a contract that exceeds three years.

630
00:53:59,434 --> 00:54:02,117
That's really the only issue that's before us today, right?

631
00:54:03,122 --> 00:54:14,192
Do we want parking enforcement for the next 3 years and look at extending a contract again at that point in time, or do we want to see if we can get more bang for our buck for a parking enforcement contract that lasts 5 years?

632
00:54:14,332 --> 00:54:23,900
That's the way that I'm looking at this, and I think that ultimately I want parking enforcement for the next 50 years, and if we can enter into a contract that saves the city money, then I think that's something we should do.

633
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:27,523
So I support the paper this evening, and I move for approval.

634
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:52,795
I can hear your passion, and I'm excited about that passion, but I tend to disagree with my colleague, which I seldom do, to the fact that we're in a position where, I'm in agreement with Council Marks, that Mrs. Zarian said it herself, that we don't even have the community input yet.

635
00:54:53,416 --> 00:55:00,602
So having a plan in place and having vehicles and a software system in place, and spending that money right now, and possibly,

636
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:13,518
possibly setting you up to feel that when we unveil this, it won't be till another five or six months, and we've just purchased something, leased something, or purchased something for five or six months that we're not using.

637
00:55:14,418 --> 00:55:16,679
And we still have to pay for that process.

638
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:19,641
We still have to pay for those materials.

639
00:55:19,701 --> 00:55:29,887
So I think that, like Council Member Marx says, I tend to agree with him in the sense that why not wait

640
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:50,112
put a plan in place where maybe we're talking to our traffic department and having them assist until we can unveil a true process so we're not running our heads into the wall like we've talked about in the past and what we see coming in the future because what we're going to see is, you know, it's, you know,

641
00:55:51,274 --> 00:55:55,056
the lack of cooperation from Republic parking, that's a hindrance.

642
00:55:55,096 --> 00:55:55,957
It's hurting us right now.

643
00:55:56,677 --> 00:55:58,519
We don't have community participation.

644
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:13,208
We truly haven't seen a plan that we could roll out that spells what we want to do, because ultimately when it comes down to it, I know you're going to hear it, Faye, but we're going to hear it too when it comes to the community members saying, wait a second, just like my dad, when he went to go find a kiosk,

645
00:56:13,808 --> 00:56:17,970
that's 70 something years old, and he walked around the neighborhood and couldn't find a kiosk.

646
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:22,553
So something simple as that, just to give people the expectations of what's coming.

647
00:56:24,154 --> 00:56:30,458
And I reiterate, I agree with you, Mrs. Ayer, and tomorrow night's an important meeting, but I'm gonna be honest with you.

648
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:33,639
If we really wanna do this right, we're gonna need more than one meeting with the community.

649
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,603
So until we know all these factors that we can put all this in, and this is why I disagree with my colleagues to the point I write that,

650
00:56:42,979 --> 00:56:44,220
We don't know where this is going yet.

651
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:54,804
At least I don't feel comfortable with it because we haven't even sat down with the Republic yet to understand what the money figures look like, what we're really looking at down the road.

652
00:56:55,265 --> 00:56:57,706
Believe me, I'm all in with this.

653
00:56:57,766 --> 00:56:59,366
I think it's gonna be a great process.

654
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:09,031
We've got a great leader in place, but at the same time, rushing it to make it happen by January 6th is an unrealistic and unachievable goal.

655
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:09,851
Can I say something?

656
00:57:11,973 --> 00:57:16,874
By the time we order a desk from Faye, it's not gonna be till February.

657
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,694
So it's something that simple.

658
00:57:18,754 --> 00:57:35,297
So, I mean, we've said a lot of contradictory things to each other, but ultimately we want this to succeed, but we also want to make sure we have everything in place that we can present it the correct way so we can vote on it in a more thorough and educated format.

659
00:57:35,377 --> 00:57:40,018
Because as the steward of fiscal responsibility of our community,

660
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:50,131
It's great that we talked about a startup of $350,000, but we don't know if we're looking at another $2 million, a million dollars, we don't know that.

661
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:53,753
And that's no one's fault, but the system, so.

662
00:57:54,193 --> 00:57:56,655
Mr. President, can I say something, please?

663
00:57:57,496 --> 00:58:00,998
To your comment, I think you guys are thinking about this.

664
00:58:01,018 --> 00:58:03,439
I'm not sure.

665
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:10,264
I understand that you guys aren't used to doing parking, but there are physical systems that you have to put in place now.

666
00:58:11,475 --> 00:58:19,499
This, what I'm talking about getting cars, getting employees on board are the things you have to do to do the things that you're talking about.

667
00:58:20,059 --> 00:58:25,862
Enforce, there's no reason why enforcement needs to stop while you're discussing the permits and the policy.

668
00:58:26,443 --> 00:58:27,543
There's no reason for that.

669
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:33,906
There's no reason why collections of the monies needs to stop while we're doing these other things.

670
00:58:34,487 --> 00:58:40,650
The reason why I came to you with these basics is so that that can keep happening because my reality is

671
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:44,251
Your expectation is that my department will support itself.

672
00:58:44,851 --> 00:58:51,714
Well, if you make me wait and not do any of those basic things, then that's undermining my success.

673
00:58:52,414 --> 00:58:55,615
You will be undermining my ability to be successful.

674
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:58,756
I understand that there's policies that you want to discuss.

675
00:58:59,016 --> 00:58:59,236
Wow.

676
00:58:59,556 --> 00:59:02,957
Thank you, Mr. President.

677
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:04,118
I was hoping those weren't the words.

678
00:59:04,298 --> 00:59:04,478
Wow.

679
00:59:05,286 --> 00:59:16,556
I was hoping those weren't the words we were gonna hear tonight because I had a sneaky suspicion, Mr. President, that the mayor could move forward with a three-year contract on her own.

680
00:59:17,757 --> 00:59:19,398
Doesn't need to come before the council.

681
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:24,362
Can start this program on her own right now, move forward three years.

682
00:59:24,783 --> 00:59:26,164
No one's making anyone wait.

683
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:43,646
But bringing the council into it to extend it to five years, Mr. President, all of a sudden creates a scapegoat that, oh, if the council doesn't approve the five years, we may not be able to get parking enforcement up and running because the council is standing in the way.

684
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:48,811
Meanwhile, it's three weeks, Mr. President, before this program should take effect.

685
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:49,672
Three weeks.

686
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:56,616
So I would caution my colleagues, Mr. President, that we shouldn't be listed as a scapegoat here.

687
00:59:56,996 --> 01:00:07,720
The mayor has the authority to move forward on a three-year contract and should do so if they believe for one second that this program will not be a smooth transition.

688
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:13,142
That is up to the administration if they want to move forward, Mr. President, not up to this council.

689
01:00:13,923 --> 01:00:14,823
Thank you, Mr. President.

690
01:00:15,475 --> 01:00:19,841
Mr. President, I believe Faye was speaking, if I may just interject here.

691
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:24,087
I just want to reinforce what Faye was saying a moment ago.

692
01:00:24,607 --> 01:00:26,870
We're talking about the transition of operations.

693
01:00:27,431 --> 01:00:31,437
There's never an intent to have the city council be the scapegoat for

694
01:00:32,057 --> 01:00:33,639
the success of this department.

695
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:41,608
We're talking about the operation of the department as far as continuing the present operations.

696
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:50,058
There needs to be further discussion, community input, more meetings of the community, discussions with the council to further policy changes.

697
01:00:50,118 --> 01:00:51,399
That's going to take more than

698
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,402
that's gonna take time, that's gonna take an incredible amount of time and effort.

699
01:00:56,023 --> 01:01:13,776
So I just wanna be clear, there was never an intent to come before you to ask for a five-year contract to put any responsibility on the council as far as this project is concerned, this responsibility, this responsibility is an operational responsibility and that responsibility rests with the administration and the staff.

700
01:01:14,676 --> 01:01:16,057
So I just wanna be very clear about that.

701
01:01:16,077 --> 01:01:21,361
So if you don't get the vote tonight for five years, this program will be seamless and you'll keep on moving forward.

702
01:01:21,713 --> 01:01:24,554
It will cost more to do the contract.

703
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:29,835
How much more will it cost?

704
01:01:30,615 --> 01:01:33,136
It's not about how much it will cost up front.

705
01:01:33,696 --> 01:01:38,757
For the car contract, as I explained, it's about what the rollover will be.

706
01:01:38,857 --> 01:01:43,798
G-Techno will go ahead and do a three-year contract, which is not industry standard, but they will do it.

707
01:01:44,298 --> 01:01:49,480
But then yes, the fees may be higher because that's how they make their money.

708
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,380
This is a business for them as well.

709
01:01:51,885 --> 01:01:55,030
Right, so you don't have what the cost difference is.

710
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:57,293
I provided the three and the five year contract.

711
01:02:00,852 --> 01:02:04,294
Right, but no one knows how much more it's gonna cost, if indeed it will cost more.

712
01:02:05,314 --> 01:02:30,327
To me, again, Mr. President, honestly, with all due respect, I will not support this tonight because the administration can move forward with the three-year contract on their own, Mr. President, and I wish them well doing so, but this council does not know how this program's gonna run, and I don't see how anyone behind this reel can vote on allowing this to take place

713
01:02:31,187 --> 01:02:35,588
without the proper protocols in place to safeguard the residents of this community.

714
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:46,311
And even though we may not be responsible, as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, for the nuts and bolts of creating policy and procedure and so forth, you're allowing for the contract.

715
01:02:46,611 --> 01:02:48,511
So you're allowing for the five-year contract.

716
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:53,592
Therefore, you are giving the green light to go ahead on whatever results from this program.

717
01:02:53,892 --> 01:02:57,313
Whatever the results are, you're allowing that to move forward.

718
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:00,234
So I guess you can say indirectly you are responsible.

719
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:02,621
And that's how I see it, Mr. President.

720
01:03:02,781 --> 01:03:04,143
Thank you.

721
01:03:05,424 --> 01:03:09,069
I just think it's also important to look at this from the other side of the glass.

722
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:14,495
And why are we assuming this is going to be a failure?

723
01:03:15,436 --> 01:03:20,663
You know, why are we assuming that us taking this in-house, which is what we cried for, is not going to work?

724
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:25,667
And if we're going to share in the failures, then I'm assuming we'd also share in the successes.

725
01:03:25,807 --> 01:03:26,527
It's our community.

726
01:03:26,647 --> 01:03:27,408
That's what we're here for.

727
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:30,690
You know, we had to, we had to improve the lives of the residents in the city.

728
01:03:31,371 --> 01:03:34,693
And, you know, one of the things that we talked about was taking parking in house.

729
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:38,996
And if we're going to take parking in house, there are certain steps of protocols that we need to take.

730
01:03:39,776 --> 01:03:44,340
This is one of them that's been recommended by someone who's worked in the industry who explains that this is industry standard.

731
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:48,743
That's something that someone I've worked with in government 20 years ago, when I remember fondly,

732
01:03:49,683 --> 01:04:01,449
You know, I don't think that this is a situation where we're walking into the rollout of the first parking management plan that the city of Medford has ever seen in the middle of the winter, seven years ago.

733
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:04,230
You know, we've come a long way since that.

734
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:11,293
Our residents in this community have become accustomed to certain aspects of parking enforcement.

735
01:04:11,553 --> 01:04:12,594
I wanna see them continue.

736
01:04:12,634 --> 01:04:13,354
I know you do too.

737
01:04:13,394 --> 01:04:17,176
You've been the strongest advocate in this council for parking enforcement for the past 15 years, Mike.

738
01:04:18,053 --> 01:04:19,634
I'm not trying to take anything away from you from that.

739
01:04:20,074 --> 01:04:22,936
I just think in looking at this and us moving forward.

740
01:04:23,336 --> 01:04:25,017
This is could be a very successful program.

741
01:04:25,637 --> 01:04:27,338
This could be a very successful program.

742
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:28,619
So let's put the tools in the toolbox.

743
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:32,381
Let's give them the tools that they need to build the foundation to make it be successful.

744
01:04:32,881 --> 01:04:33,942
Because I feel as though

745
01:04:34,881 --> 01:04:41,703
If we look at this from the glass being half full, it's something that we can also share in all the successes that come with it as well.

746
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:52,207
I'm not nervous about this program failing and people blaming me for it because, again, the scope of the vote before us as to whether or not you want to allow the mayor to enter into a contract that's three years or five years.

747
01:04:52,887 --> 01:05:02,069
I don't think the 24 months makes a big difference when we have a cable contract that goes for 10, we have a trash contract that goes for 10, and we had a previous contract with parking administration that went for seven plus three.

748
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,790
So that's where I'm coming from.

749
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:05,410
And I can understand you're passionate about the issue.

750
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:12,952
And quite frankly, if I'm more educated on it than me, and if I'm more invested in this parking issue than me, you served on the first parking commission, you made recommendations, you worked with this commission.

751
01:05:13,332 --> 01:05:14,833
So I understand where you're coming from, I really do.

752
01:05:14,853 --> 01:05:17,193
I just think that- Mr. President, if I could just follow up.

753
01:05:17,253 --> 01:05:18,734
That's a wicked long point of information.

754
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:19,554
I appreciate that.

755
01:05:20,034 --> 01:05:21,755
I appreciate the vice president's comment.

756
01:05:22,276 --> 01:05:27,640
I think he hit the nail on the head when he said we shouldn't be talking about this program failing.

757
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:29,762
What program?

758
01:05:31,283 --> 01:05:33,225
What plan?

759
01:05:33,305 --> 01:05:40,590
Show me one paper that has a plan or a program of anything regarding parking enforcement in this community.

760
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,672
Show it to me tonight and I'll vote on it.

761
01:05:43,813 --> 01:05:46,155
There's not one plan, Mr. President.

762
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:56,891
laid out, other than the fact that they want to sign a couple of contracts, which I agree that stuff, they said it right, that stuff is needed to set up a program.

763
01:05:57,852 --> 01:06:08,241
But with three to four weeks out, and there's not one piece of paper in front of me to say how they're going to operate a parking program in this community, not one piece.

764
01:06:09,543 --> 01:06:13,286
So you're right, I can't speak to failure because I can't see what's gonna fail.

765
01:06:13,526 --> 01:06:17,429
There's nothing here to make an educated, informed decision on.

766
01:06:19,497 --> 01:06:20,537
And that's what we're here for.

767
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:23,419
We're here, Mr. President, to be the safeguard.

768
01:06:24,339 --> 01:06:30,702
And, you know, as Council Vice President mentioned, you know, I don't want to blow my own horn, Mr. President, but guess what?

769
01:06:31,142 --> 01:06:41,366
It was back many, many, many years ago, many years ago, when this city did zero enforcement and they wanted to build a parking garage on Governor's Ave.

770
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:42,927
We all remember that.

771
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:49,012
after the old one came into disrepair and had to be taken down.

772
01:06:49,793 --> 01:07:07,521
And the reason why this council said we weren't gonna move forward a parking garage is because we truly couldn't understand the parking needs in this community because people could park anywhere they wanted in any of our business districts for eight to 10 hours, take the bus into town and never pay a nickel.

773
01:07:08,488 --> 01:07:13,789
And at the time, members of this council said, how are we going to establish a pay to park garage?

774
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:18,692
where you could park anywhere in the city and not ever be in fear of getting a ticket.

775
01:07:19,092 --> 01:07:21,633
It's not gonna work having to pay to park garage.

776
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:27,936
So our recommendation was put together a parking management program in this community.

777
01:07:28,317 --> 01:07:31,018
Then we would consider a parking garage in the square.

778
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:32,939
And that's exactly what we did.

779
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:40,603
And then at the time, Mayor McGlynn, who we didn't see eye to eye on anything, Mr. President, appointed me to the parking commission

780
01:07:41,383 --> 01:07:44,124
to oversee parking enforcement in this community.

781
01:07:44,624 --> 01:07:46,224
And that's why it was established.

782
01:07:46,644 --> 01:07:52,005
So we can have people sitting behind this rail, looking in the sky and doing whatever they want, Mr. President.

783
01:07:52,345 --> 01:07:56,106
But that's how it was implemented in this community, Mr. President.

784
01:07:56,406 --> 01:08:04,348
And I wanna make sure that we're not just here to do a quick rush to judgment, Mr. President, that we do our homework and due diligence.

785
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:06,608
I'm not gonna be behind this rail in three weeks.

786
01:08:07,028 --> 01:08:08,929
So I can go like this and brush my hands off.

787
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,892
But I want to make sure this community is not left out in the lurch.

788
01:08:13,473 --> 01:08:20,100
And right now, what we're hearing right now from the administration, there's no plan for parking enforcement in this community.

789
01:08:20,701 --> 01:08:31,704
And I'm not prepared to vote tonight, Mr. President, on giving an extension to a contract that doesn't present any facts, figures, dollars amount, dollar amount, nothing at all, Mr. President.

790
01:08:31,984 --> 01:08:38,645
Maybe other members of the council who wanna stick their head in the sand once again could do so, but I'm not gonna do that, Mr. President.

791
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:39,986
That's not how I operate.

792
01:08:43,046 --> 01:08:43,987
Thank you, Mr. President.

793
01:08:44,007 --> 01:08:44,727
Hasn't this been fun?

794
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:48,928
Thank you for presenting this tonight.

795
01:08:51,385 --> 01:08:56,168
It's pretty clear to me that no matter what path we take, these are two items that we're gonna need.

796
01:08:57,128 --> 01:08:59,150
And that's kind of the conversation that we're on right now.

797
01:09:00,491 --> 01:09:04,593
Looking at agreement two, $38,000 over five years, that seems great.

798
01:09:05,033 --> 01:09:09,756
It seems like Reef Parking Republic was taking us to the woodshed for about a million, $2 million a year.

799
01:09:10,937 --> 01:09:12,898
So that's fantastic, I really appreciate that.

800
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:17,561
And having that figure, that dollar amount in front of us right now.

801
01:09:18,409 --> 01:09:23,214
for five years worth of technical services for collection of fees.

802
01:09:25,135 --> 01:09:28,578
On agreement one, I didn't see it in the presentation proposal.

803
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:34,784
Is there a five-year cost for that contract or is that dependent on us entering it?

804
01:09:36,165 --> 01:09:36,746
The cars, yeah.

805
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:39,355
So sorry.

806
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:40,015
You're fine.

807
01:09:40,155 --> 01:09:45,216
It's just the, whatever cars we choose, the lease will just start like a regular car lease.

808
01:09:45,236 --> 01:09:47,297
There's no other monies that need to be paid.

809
01:09:47,657 --> 01:09:48,557
Great, thank you.

810
01:09:50,677 --> 01:10:03,680
And I guess on that question, and it relates as well to the next paper before us on the CAF positions, is the administration going to be bringing a supplemental appropriation for those positions, a budget appropriation for those positions?

811
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,780
And is that expected soon?

812
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,640
And would that also,

813
01:10:06,817 --> 01:10:14,401
Does this paper constitute an appropriation for the leases or are you actually gonna bring back the amounts and then we will vote on the appropriation for one and two?

814
01:10:15,522 --> 01:10:20,345
So the leases would be taken out of the ordinary budget.

815
01:10:20,505 --> 01:10:21,045
Okay, got it.

816
01:10:21,285 --> 01:10:25,007
So that's probably- So that's already been budgeted for.

817
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:32,492
Yeah, as far as the staffing is concerned, and I wanna, I know we're not on this item, but I realized a typographical error on my end.

818
01:10:32,592 --> 01:10:35,794
As far as the FTEs, Faye will go over that when we're talking about that.

819
01:10:37,783 --> 01:10:53,687
but I will also say that because we are halfway through the fiscal year, we are taking into consideration all of the budget that hasn't been carried for that first half and are able to bring on the right minimum staffing level at the beginning.

820
01:10:54,447 --> 01:11:04,489
All of this is with the understanding that we're going to be bringing in revenue direct to the city, that revenue direct that will be used, which actually has been analyzed by Faye and our finance team.

821
01:11:04,509 --> 01:11:05,810
We can talk about that on the next paper.

822
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:06,550
I just wanted to know,

823
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:12,693
So these are coming out of the ordinary budget that's already been appropriated in the fiscal 22 budget.

824
01:11:13,153 --> 01:11:13,353
Great.

825
01:11:17,195 --> 01:11:19,457
You know, I don't think I have any, any more questions at this point.

826
01:11:19,497 --> 01:11:21,778
It seems like these are things we're going to need no matter what.

827
01:11:22,598 --> 01:11:29,062
I will say in terms of transition, it's been pretty clear to me and basically any resident who's parking in the square that the current vendor isn't enforcing anything.

828
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,111
and hasn't been enforcing anything for months.

829
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:38,794
So we've been in transition, you know, we have no parking enforcement in the city because the vendor is, you know, taking their ball and going home.

830
01:11:40,035 --> 01:11:48,058
So it sounds like to me, if we were able to do this, that at least we'll be able to get that base level of enforcement back up relatively quickly, and we will have the community input.

831
01:11:48,098 --> 01:11:58,263
And it sounds to me, given what I have talked to folks about previous programs you've worked on, Fay, that, you know, there'll be constant community feedback

832
01:11:59,153 --> 01:12:01,575
for the length of your service here in this community.

833
01:12:01,595 --> 01:12:03,216
That's how parking works.

834
01:12:03,536 --> 01:12:04,617
To improve, well, right.

835
01:12:04,717 --> 01:12:10,741
And I can tell you the emails and phone calls I get that I have constant input and feedback around parking.

836
01:12:12,502 --> 01:12:19,187
So, you know, at the end of the day, this seems to me to be fundamentally about

837
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:32,827
do we trust that we're going to move forward, that we're going to bring parking in house, that these are tools that we need, and that these are the two leases for these two specific products that will be at the best cost for the city and serve the program well.

838
01:12:33,748 --> 01:12:38,971
And I'm, you know, supportive of that tonight, have seconded council night's motion to support that.

839
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:40,712
And I just don't think that

840
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:44,952
you know, the best way to make policy is covering our butts.

841
01:12:45,452 --> 01:12:47,373
I just don't think that's the best way to make policy.

842
01:12:47,413 --> 01:12:49,474
So I think we should move forward with this tonight.

843
01:12:50,275 --> 01:12:54,537
And secondly, you know, I would have used a more choice word, but we are on television.

844
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,822
In addition, if we're talking about rule 17, I think we've gone way over 15 minutes and three times per person on this topic.

845
01:13:02,882 --> 01:13:04,663
So there's a motion that's seconded.

846
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:06,924
If people have not talked three times.

847
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:11,566
Thank you, because I'd like to just move forward with this.

848
01:13:11,646 --> 01:13:12,006
Thank you.

849
01:13:22,658 --> 01:13:24,199
Thank you, Mr. President, thank you.

850
01:13:24,339 --> 01:13:24,920
Thank you very much.

851
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,940
I know this isn't easy.

852
01:13:26,141 --> 01:13:36,667
And I do share the concerns of the planning questions that were raised.

853
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:48,874
And I think, you know, you're in a tough position too, because you've only been here six weeks and, you know, the decision to bring parking into the city, I had to have a city manager made a while back.

854
01:13:49,595 --> 01:13:50,155
And I think that,

855
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:54,391
you know, in between you being hired and that decision, not a lot happens.

856
01:13:55,292 --> 01:14:05,816
And I think that's the unfortunate piece, because I think there does need to be a lot of planning for this to move forward, especially for it to be successful, you know, on January 6th.

857
01:14:05,856 --> 01:14:11,378
And I think that's going to be the really tough piece is that, you know, you really don't want there to be any drop off on January 6th.

858
01:14:13,313 --> 01:14:15,515
you know, but that's got that point of information.

859
01:14:15,555 --> 01:14:18,077
It'll be pickup because right now nothing's going on.

860
01:14:18,918 --> 01:14:24,042
I will tell you, I will tell you that I paid the ticket that I got a couple of weeks ago.

861
01:14:24,122 --> 01:14:27,545
So they asked, so I'll be the first one to tell you that.

862
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:34,037
But, you know, I do have some concerns too.

863
01:14:34,097 --> 01:14:37,499
I mean, you know, we talked about vehicles, just a few minutes.

864
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:45,763
Well, when I first asked my question earlier in the meeting, we talked about vehicles and you mentioned about how you're unable to see the mileage on one of the vehicles.

865
01:14:46,363 --> 01:14:49,904
And then President Carviello mentions that there's newer cars driving around.

866
01:14:49,964 --> 01:14:53,026
So I have a lot of questions as to why don't we have

867
01:14:53,606 --> 01:14:54,767
the correct inventory.

868
01:14:56,788 --> 01:15:00,531
Why don't we have the correct inventory of how many vehicles are coming over?

869
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:02,372
When is this all said and done?

870
01:15:02,392 --> 01:15:03,953
That number we should have right now.

871
01:15:03,993 --> 01:15:06,454
We should know it's two cars, five cars, four cars.

872
01:15:06,474 --> 01:15:08,776
Mr. President, I gave you the correct number.

873
01:15:08,816 --> 01:15:11,177
You have two vehicles coming back to the city.

874
01:15:11,318 --> 01:15:11,618
That's it.

875
01:15:12,088 --> 01:15:15,209
But we're hearing that, we're hearing that.

876
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:17,890
They enforce in Cambridge, they enforce in other cities.

877
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:22,611
I'm sure they have other vehicles other than R2, but the city has two vehicles.

878
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:25,712
The two vans that I've described is all that's coming back to you.

879
01:15:25,792 --> 01:15:27,572
When I see them, I'm gonna take some pictures for you, Faye.

880
01:15:27,972 --> 01:15:28,212
Huh?

881
01:15:28,412 --> 01:15:30,173
When I see them, I'm gonna take some pictures for you, Faye.

882
01:15:30,353 --> 01:15:31,113
Okay, thank you.

883
01:15:31,133 --> 01:15:38,296
But all I can tell you is looking at your contract, and you are where you are because there was no oversight.

884
01:15:38,717 --> 01:15:45,340
But I think looking at your contract and what's the appendixes that are in there, there's nothing in there that says you have cars.

885
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:49,842
You have two vehicles, the 2014 Nissan and the RAV4.

886
01:15:49,862 --> 01:15:50,862
That's all you have.

887
01:15:53,641 --> 01:15:59,847
Okay, so still a concern, even though there's two in the contract, it sounds like there might be some more out there, but we don't know for sure.

888
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:02,150
I can only tell you what's in the contract and what I've been shown.

889
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,511
And I understand.

890
01:16:03,571 --> 01:16:12,180
And as far as the meters and the equipment, have you received a full inventory of what we're receiving back and what condition it's in and how old it is and that type of stuff?

891
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:12,720
Yes.

892
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:14,022
Oh, you have, okay.

893
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:14,820
Yes.

894
01:16:15,261 --> 01:16:15,962
Okay.

895
01:16:16,062 --> 01:16:19,447
And you said you're meeting with Republic Parking, is it next week?

896
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:20,849
We're meeting here Monday.

897
01:16:20,929 --> 01:16:22,071
Monday, okay.

898
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:23,633
And have you met yet prior to that?

899
01:16:24,474 --> 01:16:30,423
Yes, when they brought the vehicles over, when they brought over some handhelds and a canister for me to see, yes.

900
01:16:31,536 --> 01:16:34,137
but not as a meeting to discuss anything.

901
01:16:34,497 --> 01:16:35,797
I'm not authorized to do that.

902
01:16:35,977 --> 01:16:45,120
That's what the executive office and myself and Todd in transportation, there is a group that will be meeting with them as well as legal.

903
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,741
So it was no transition conversation.

904
01:16:48,801 --> 01:16:51,361
It was just evaluating what we have.

905
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:54,482
You can't talk transition with the current parking company on your own?

906
01:16:58,707 --> 01:17:04,034
I have no desire to talk transition with the current parking company without your legal team with me.

907
01:17:04,354 --> 01:17:04,534
Yes.

908
01:17:05,756 --> 01:17:06,837
Without the legal team with you.

909
01:17:06,877 --> 01:17:07,178
Correct.

910
01:17:07,378 --> 01:17:09,020
Which would be city solicitor Scanlon?

911
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:11,142
Or is it KP Law?

912
01:17:11,323 --> 01:17:11,843
KP Law.

913
01:17:11,983 --> 01:17:15,488
And city solicitor Scanlon has been involved in these discussions.

914
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:17,951
So we have KP Law and city solicitor Scanlon?

915
01:17:18,475 --> 01:17:25,560
Well, we keep City Solicitor Scanlon involved in all of the discussions that go to KP Law.

916
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:31,063
She is the central focal point on all the work that we get special counsel on.

917
01:17:31,824 --> 01:17:36,987
KP Law has a special counsel for contracts that the city uses for contract related matters.

918
01:17:37,007 --> 01:17:38,368
It's like any other discipline.

919
01:17:38,408 --> 01:17:39,628
It has multiple sectors.

920
01:17:39,668 --> 01:17:41,790
I'm sure you can all appreciate that.

921
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,492
And just to be clear,

922
01:17:45,455 --> 01:18:01,585
a huge part of the work that Fay has been doing is to understand what exists, all the tremendous amount of time that she's been spending is to inventory look at, I mean I've learned vocabulary words through Fay because of all the things she's described the double yolks of, you know,

923
01:18:02,726 --> 01:18:10,853
meter heads and all these details and the material that these meter heads should be stationed on to ensure that they're strong and have the support that they need.

924
01:18:11,334 --> 01:18:16,438
There's a lot that's gone on behind the scenes as far as understanding the inventory.

925
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:22,403
And as Faye has said it in multiple emails, in communications to me and to others,

926
01:18:23,471 --> 01:18:25,952
We have to truly understand exactly what we have.

927
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:31,273
She's walked the streets, she's gone out and she's knocked on the door of the office.

928
01:18:31,653 --> 01:18:37,475
She's identified times where their door hasn't been open and they haven't been accessible and immediately written an email to them.

929
01:18:37,535 --> 01:18:46,177
There's been a tremendous amount of work to get to the point in which we're able to have a comprehensive discussion with them on this transition.

930
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:50,368
And we've been working towards this for quite some time.

931
01:18:50,949 --> 01:18:56,854
In the time that Faye's been here, we've made a tremendous amount more progress than before we had a parking expert here.

932
01:18:58,156 --> 01:18:59,016
I'm glad Faye's here.

933
01:18:59,297 --> 01:19:08,145
I think it's... I'm glad Faye's here and I wish you success.

934
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:19,404
I do have some concerns, you know, with regard to the law tonight, the contract, I do have concerns about, you know, when I hear that there could be additional vehicles, even though there's two in the contract, I get that.

935
01:19:20,585 --> 01:19:24,585
So, but I thank you for your time tonight and I thank you for answering our questions.

936
01:19:24,705 --> 01:19:26,866
Okay, one more thing, Mr. President, if you don't mind.

937
01:19:26,886 --> 01:19:36,488
Yeah, I'm just as disappointed because I know what the city's expectations were and it was my job to come in and tell them what the truth is.

938
01:19:37,437 --> 01:19:39,118
And that's all I'm trying to do.

939
01:19:39,678 --> 01:19:41,059
You may want those other cars.

940
01:19:41,099 --> 01:19:46,421
You may think they're out there accessible to you, but your contract doesn't call for you to have anything but those two vehicles.

941
01:19:47,081 --> 01:19:51,664
Their inventory that I received when I first started listed those two vehicles.

942
01:19:52,024 --> 01:19:57,146
And so unless someone was doing some oversight over the last seven years and has other information, please share it with me.

943
01:19:57,546 --> 01:19:58,687
I'd be happy to have it.

944
01:20:01,568 --> 01:20:02,569
Thank you, Faye.

945
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:04,850
Faye, I know we got way off track here.

946
01:20:06,953 --> 01:20:11,502
If you can give us just a brief synopsis of the equipment in agreement, too.

947
01:20:13,938 --> 01:20:23,624
And any further questions we got to the policies and procedure, we can have it a committee at the whole at a later date with a, but let's get, you know, let's get through the agreement one into it.

948
01:20:24,265 --> 01:20:28,667
So what a data management system does, and I call it a DMS.

949
01:20:28,788 --> 01:20:34,051
So that's when I, if I say that, I apologize, but I'm used to using the shorthand.

950
01:20:34,391 --> 01:20:37,173
What that will do is allow you to process ticket writing.

951
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:42,963
It provides you with the handheld for the parking control specialists.

952
01:20:43,503 --> 01:20:52,290
And in your case, your traffic department is also going to go from handwritten tickets and buy 27 of those for their department through this contract.

953
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:56,273
They're paying for that, not me, but through this association.

954
01:20:56,874 --> 01:21:04,840
It also provides us with a portal for our payments online for tickets, for permit payments online and issuance online.

955
01:21:06,098 --> 01:21:11,023
So the data management system is what allows all of your operations to happen.

956
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:15,067
Your appeals process will be set up in there so that people can do it online.

957
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:21,553
All of that that makes the engine of the department run is in your data management system.

958
01:21:24,176 --> 01:21:26,558
So that's what is in agreement too.

959
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:29,001
And that's both systems, correct?

960
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:42,952
Yes, your whole operating parking system will run through this one system provided by GTECNA through a backdoor system, a data management system that would be visible to myself and also the traffic.

961
01:21:43,352 --> 01:21:44,953
Tickets will be written in real time.

962
01:21:45,714 --> 01:21:49,195
So if you get a ticket at one o'clock, it's in the system at one o'clock.

963
01:21:49,275 --> 01:21:53,497
If you're in the city visiting and you got a ticket, you can stop and pay it on your way out of town.

964
01:21:53,697 --> 01:21:56,058
And my understanding is that's an improvement from where we are today.

965
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:59,140
It wasn't in real time.

966
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,581
Thank you, Mr. President, thank you for that.

967
01:22:05,001 --> 01:22:10,982
As I'm sure you found out in your research there was a data breach recently, a few months ago with reef parking.

968
01:22:11,382 --> 01:22:21,044
So I'm just curious with G tech know where the, you know, private secured where that data lives, as we're going to have you know license plates addresses.

969
01:22:21,624 --> 01:22:23,465
It actually lives in house with us.

970
01:22:24,445 --> 01:22:32,570
And so it would be our security as well as, as G techness and I'm sure G techno will work with our IT department to make sure that that firewall is appropriate.

971
01:22:33,371 --> 01:22:48,320
Yes, that encrypted information that we will have people's license plates information you're correct we will be able to see that with the parking clerk will have the ability to do relate releases at the DMV, they will be able to see that information that's not

972
01:22:49,751 --> 01:22:54,093
Unusual, that's every city in Massachusetts does that.

973
01:22:54,373 --> 01:22:55,493
Right, it's a function of needing a job.

974
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:57,154
Yeah, it's a function of parking.

975
01:22:57,394 --> 01:23:02,836
Okay, and then, so there, but they will offer IT support that will work with our IT as well?

976
01:23:03,196 --> 01:23:03,796
Absolutely.

977
01:23:04,517 --> 01:23:09,498
It's crucial for that to be integrated because I have to integrate with other departments as well.

978
01:23:10,299 --> 01:23:15,361
I will have to integrate with treasury to some degree because cash payments have to come in through them.

979
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:19,102
So it's all about GTechNA coming in and working with our folks

980
01:23:19,693 --> 01:23:27,316
And the gentleman who is working on our system, would be working on our system is a retired police officer.

981
01:23:27,396 --> 01:23:38,040
So security is the reason why I picked them is not only they have a really awesome, they have a better operating system than my left, but they take security very serious.

982
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:39,379
Okay, great, thank you.

983
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:43,322
And so that support they offer, that's the length of the contract?

984
01:23:43,502 --> 01:23:44,983
The length of the contract, correct.

985
01:23:45,003 --> 01:23:45,083
Okay.

986
01:23:45,443 --> 01:23:58,873
And we can always, the thing about these systems is, as we're operating and our needs change, we can contract for them to upgrade, change, tweak, whatever we see is necessary.

987
01:23:59,094 --> 01:24:00,335
With an existing contract?

988
01:24:00,555 --> 01:24:00,835
Mm-hmm.

989
01:24:01,255 --> 01:24:02,736
Okay, great, thank you for that.

990
01:24:02,977 --> 01:24:04,238
You're welcome.

991
01:24:04,258 --> 01:24:06,019
Any other questions on agreement two?

992
01:24:10,186 --> 01:24:20,480
When you talk about hardware that's going to be purchased, what assumptions are being made in regards to the type of enforcement that we're going to do in this community?

993
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:23,184
We're not making any assumptions.

994
01:24:24,065 --> 01:24:27,407
The first thing G-Tech did was review all of our parking rules.

995
01:24:28,108 --> 01:24:31,951
And so all of that would be implemented into our background system.

996
01:24:32,011 --> 01:24:39,917
So when you print a ticket and it's for overtime parking, all of that information from our parking rules would be available.

997
01:24:40,177 --> 01:24:45,501
So I'm thinking more of a basic, G-Tech provides a service.

998
01:24:46,201 --> 01:24:50,885
Naturally, they don't know what type of program we wanna run in this community.

999
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:57,876
Correct, so it's something that we have to explain to them, hey, we're looking to do X, Y, and Z. Correct.

1000
01:24:58,036 --> 01:25:07,062
So in order to explain to them what we're trying to do, I assume the city has some assumptions on what type of enforcement we'd like to do.

1001
01:25:07,822 --> 01:25:10,324
Are we doing citywide enforcement?

1002
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:13,067
Are we going to be doing kiosks, meters?

1003
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,989
Are we going to be doing overnight parking?

1004
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:18,951
What type of enforcement?

1005
01:25:18,971 --> 01:25:25,717
So I'd like to know what type of assumptions are being made based on the purchase of this hardware.

1006
01:25:26,223 --> 01:25:27,884
There are no assumptions being made.

1007
01:25:28,425 --> 01:25:33,708
I've chosen this hardware based on your rules that you have in place right now.

1008
01:25:34,169 --> 01:25:35,810
There's no need to change anything.

1009
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:42,274
You seem to want to give this equipment more gravitas than it really has.

1010
01:25:42,314 --> 01:25:46,597
It's a basic handheld that prints tickets based on a violation.

1011
01:25:47,478 --> 01:25:47,778
That's it.

1012
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:51,854
Right, so how many handheld devices are we gonna purchase?

1013
01:25:52,474 --> 01:25:54,875
One per parking control specialist.

1014
01:25:55,515 --> 01:26:00,716
So an assumption's made that we're gonna have how many parking enforcement clerks?

1015
01:26:01,016 --> 01:26:02,917
There's no assumption, I'm gonna have five.

1016
01:26:02,937 --> 01:26:05,537
You're gonna have five, and that will cover us citywide?

1017
01:26:06,457 --> 01:26:06,878
Correct.

1018
01:26:07,378 --> 01:26:10,819
And that will cover us 24-7 in permit parking and so forth?

1019
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:12,399
Along with traffic, correct.

1020
01:26:12,859 --> 01:26:14,279
And that will cover us on weekends?

1021
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,660
Saturdays, correct.

1022
01:26:17,155 --> 01:26:25,680
Okay, and the readers on the back of the vehicles now that do the plate readers that do the... Are you talking about LPR?

1023
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,200
Yes.

1024
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:33,624
Those plate readers, are we gonna continue the same process that Park Medford is using or are we gonna do something different?

1025
01:26:34,945 --> 01:26:39,307
At this point, the LPRs that Park Medford will be turning over

1026
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,199
are barely functional.

1027
01:26:41,519 --> 01:26:45,100
Two of the cameras on one of them are not functioning.

1028
01:26:46,321 --> 01:26:54,903
LPRs are good for if you're riding down the street checking permits and in large, large parking lots.

1029
01:26:56,063 --> 01:26:58,444
It's overkill for small areas.

1030
01:26:59,384 --> 01:27:00,164
I don't envision

1031
01:27:01,293 --> 01:27:10,455
needing it on your main streets, because I agree with you, I think the kiosks are an error on your Medford Square, on your main streets.

1032
01:27:11,175 --> 01:27:12,475
I'm sorry, I didn't get that there, what?

1033
01:27:13,936 --> 01:27:20,937
The kiosks are an error on your main streets, that people prefer to have single head meters that they can get out and pay.

1034
01:27:21,517 --> 01:27:22,798
And certainly I agree with that.

1035
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:24,938
But at this moment in time,

1036
01:27:26,056 --> 01:27:27,717
I don't have the money to make that happen.

1037
01:27:27,878 --> 01:27:33,202
So that is a wish list and that is a plan that I will plan towards.

1038
01:27:33,302 --> 01:27:44,952
But right now you're in a position to fix and upgrade what you need to out in the field so that it can continue to be used so that I can collect monies to afford to upgrade them.

1039
01:27:46,046 --> 01:27:53,973
So that was just excellent information because I think you're letting us in on what we're gonna eventually do.

1040
01:27:54,553 --> 01:27:59,918
And it seems like now we're carrying out what currently is there and eventually you may move on.

1041
01:28:00,999 --> 01:28:13,329
I hope eventually that, you know, I envision improving your curb appeal, forget your kiosks and everything else, your curb, you know, your parking infrastructure should be, make your curb attractive.

1042
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:14,190
And right now,

1043
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:15,791
that's not happening.

1044
01:28:16,052 --> 01:28:28,165
So that's all I, you know, there's all kinds of things that I would like to do and I will work towards, but right now I just basically need to get you back in a working functioning position.

1045
01:28:28,265 --> 01:28:28,445
Right.

1046
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:34,972
And one of the biggest concerns we've had over the last couple of years is signage in the community.

1047
01:28:35,543 --> 01:28:37,063
And even the mocking of spaces.

1048
01:28:37,884 --> 01:28:41,004
If you go clearly you'll see and even in the square and so forth.

1049
01:28:41,705 --> 01:28:45,826
There's no delineation between spaces, and so I've noticed that in some areas.

1050
01:28:45,846 --> 01:28:46,946
Yes, right, right.

1051
01:28:46,966 --> 01:28:54,388
So, so there's a large concern with that is that something that you're working in conjunction with DPW now to take a look at

1052
01:28:54,742 --> 01:28:58,363
because they do signage and responsible for markings and so forth?

1053
01:28:58,383 --> 01:29:12,228
Yes, I have talked to the gentleman at DPW and we've had some preliminary talks, but certainly there's some more information gathering I need to do before we make some decisions along that line.

1054
01:29:13,008 --> 01:29:17,590
Okay, and regarding resident permit parking citywide,

1055
01:29:18,818 --> 01:29:20,019
Any thought about that?

1056
01:29:20,579 --> 01:29:22,040
I have no thoughts about that, sir.

1057
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:22,700
I'm sorry.

1058
01:29:23,241 --> 01:29:29,665
Right now, my only thoughts are getting the basics that you need to start building what you want.

1059
01:29:30,045 --> 01:29:32,987
I can only do one thing at a time, and that has been my focus.

1060
01:29:33,147 --> 01:29:33,307
Okay.

1061
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:40,311
And what about regarding making sure every business district has kiosks or parking meters

1062
01:29:40,992 --> 01:29:42,814
and not just select business districts.

1063
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:44,616
So is that for parity?

1064
01:29:44,656 --> 01:29:46,678
Is that, is that something we're going to be looking at to make sure?

1065
01:29:46,698 --> 01:29:51,122
It is my intent to make sure the paid parking is fairly distributed around the city.

1066
01:29:51,142 --> 01:29:52,304
Yes.

1067
01:29:53,084 --> 01:29:53,465
Okay.

1068
01:29:54,065 --> 01:29:54,686
Yeah.

1069
01:29:54,726 --> 01:29:56,868
We can, we can, uh, we can ask these questions.

1070
01:29:59,351 --> 01:29:59,651
Thank you.

1071
01:30:00,372 --> 01:30:00,592
Thank you.

1072
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:03,605
Any more questions for Fay?

1073
01:30:04,246 --> 01:30:06,268
Fay, I'll just give you a little tip.

1074
01:30:06,428 --> 01:30:12,395
Councilor Marks and myself are the only two left over from the original parking program.

1075
01:30:15,418 --> 01:30:16,920
And the two of us kind of got stung on it.

1076
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:22,006
And I feel Councilor Marks' pain on what happened on the other one.

1077
01:30:22,426 --> 01:30:26,669
No, and I understand that you try to learn from your mistakes.

1078
01:30:26,849 --> 01:30:32,373
I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not aware of any mistakes I've made so far, so let me know if I have.

1079
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:38,997
And it is my intention to work very hard for this city and build a program that will make you proud.

1080
01:30:39,077 --> 01:30:40,578
It's not my intention to fail.

1081
01:30:40,598 --> 01:30:41,819
I don't like that.

1082
01:30:41,879 --> 01:30:43,060
No, we don't want you to fail either.

1083
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,020
That's right.

1084
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:49,324
And I'm very much capable of asking for help and what I need to make sure we are successful.

1085
01:30:49,344 --> 01:30:50,505
And I think we all understand that these

1086
01:30:51,285 --> 01:30:54,126
These are some of the tools that you need to move forward.

1087
01:30:54,846 --> 01:30:59,368
So any more questions before?

1088
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:08,312
All right, so do we want to vote on agreement one and two separately, or you want to vote on it as one package?

1089
01:31:11,053 --> 01:31:11,413
One paper.

1090
01:31:15,383 --> 01:31:19,930
On the motion by, excuse me, by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Betz.

1091
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:22,734
Mr. President, were there two separate agreements?

1092
01:31:23,996 --> 01:31:26,039
I think it would be wise to take two separate votes.

1093
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:27,621
Motion so moved.

1094
01:31:27,641 --> 01:31:27,842
Second.

1095
01:31:29,404 --> 01:31:35,030
Okay, so on the motion to sever by Vice President Nays, seconded by Councilor Baez.

1096
01:31:35,851 --> 01:31:36,592
All those in favor?

1097
01:31:36,852 --> 01:31:37,312
Aye.

1098
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:38,253
All opposed?

1099
01:31:38,293 --> 01:31:39,034
Motion passes.

1100
01:31:39,194 --> 01:31:45,101
So on agreement one, to allow the parking department to purchase the vehicles.

1101
01:31:46,342 --> 01:31:47,243
Mr. President.

1102
01:31:47,922 --> 01:32:02,130
I'd like my vote to reflect, Mr. President, the records that I am in opposition based on the fact that I think there should be a three-year contract, which the mayor is allowed to do unilaterally and not involve this council.

1103
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:02,490
Thank you.

1104
01:32:03,191 --> 01:32:07,694
Mr. President, I would like my vote to be reflected the same way, three-year contract.

1105
01:32:08,034 --> 01:32:09,895
I'm not in favor of a five-year contract.

1106
01:32:10,015 --> 01:32:10,235
Thank you.

1107
01:32:11,102 --> 01:32:16,603
So on the motion, on agreement one by Councilor Nights, seconded by Councilor Beers.

1108
01:32:17,143 --> 01:32:17,884
All those in favor?

1109
01:32:18,264 --> 01:32:18,344
Aye.

1110
01:32:18,464 --> 01:32:19,604
Roll call vote, Mr. President.

1111
01:32:20,204 --> 01:32:23,685
Roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Marks.

1112
01:32:23,845 --> 01:32:24,165
Yes.

1113
01:32:24,865 --> 01:32:26,886
Councilor, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1114
01:32:27,246 --> 01:32:27,886
Councilor Beers?

1115
01:32:27,986 --> 01:32:28,306
Yes.

1116
01:32:29,206 --> 01:32:29,827
Councilor Fevella?

1117
01:32:30,007 --> 01:32:30,207
No.

1118
01:32:30,907 --> 01:32:31,607
Vice President Nights?

1119
01:32:31,767 --> 01:32:31,967
Yes.

1120
01:32:32,907 --> 01:32:33,467
Councilor Marks?

1121
01:32:33,627 --> 01:32:33,808
No.

1122
01:32:34,648 --> 01:32:35,228
Councilor Morrell?

1123
01:32:35,408 --> 01:32:35,628
Yes.

1124
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:37,168
Councilor Scarpelli?

1125
01:32:37,348 --> 01:32:37,528
No.

1126
01:32:38,729 --> 01:32:39,509
President Kerrio?

1127
01:32:39,569 --> 01:32:39,729
Yes.

1128
01:32:42,503 --> 01:32:43,604
four, three motion passes.

1129
01:32:44,565 --> 01:32:52,911
On agreement number two, on agreement number two, to purchase the hardware systems.

1130
01:32:54,072 --> 01:32:54,713
Motion approved.

1131
01:32:56,214 --> 01:33:06,082
On the motion by council members, seconded by, seconded by best president Knight, roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Mox.

1132
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:09,790
Councilor Behrs?

1133
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:10,171
Yes.

1134
01:33:11,131 --> 01:33:11,752
Councilor Falco?

1135
01:33:11,992 --> 01:33:12,152
No.

1136
01:33:13,053 --> 01:33:13,753
Vice President Knight?

1137
01:33:13,813 --> 01:33:14,053
Yes.

1138
01:33:15,114 --> 01:33:15,674
Councilor Marks?

1139
01:33:15,915 --> 01:33:16,115
No.

1140
01:33:17,035 --> 01:33:17,636
Councilor Morrell?

1141
01:33:17,856 --> 01:33:18,076
Yes.

1142
01:33:19,057 --> 01:33:19,757
Councilor Scarpelli?

1143
01:33:20,138 --> 01:33:20,298
No.

1144
01:33:21,078 --> 01:33:21,759
President Kerrio?

1145
01:33:21,879 --> 01:33:22,099
Yes.

1146
01:33:22,299 --> 01:33:24,581
For the affirmative, three negative, motion passes.

1147
01:33:26,411 --> 01:33:34,340
Faye, we will call, hopefully after the first meeting, we will call a council meeting of the whole to answer a lot of the questions that were asked tonight.

1148
01:33:34,821 --> 01:33:39,627
And hopefully by then you'll have more information to answer.

1149
01:33:40,903 --> 01:33:41,683
have a lot more.

1150
01:33:41,703 --> 01:33:45,084
And I'm going to get you some pictures of those guys when I'm driving around.

1151
01:33:45,284 --> 01:33:46,464
OK, I appreciate that.

1152
01:33:46,504 --> 01:33:49,745
But unless you can write it into your contract, I don't know what you want me to do.

1153
01:33:49,785 --> 01:33:52,826
Because I can't believe you're driving around with all these things that don't work out.

1154
01:33:52,846 --> 01:33:53,646
Can you go back in time?

1155
01:33:53,666 --> 01:33:54,126
Can I go back in time?

1156
01:33:54,146 --> 01:33:54,846
Can you time travel?

1157
01:33:54,866 --> 01:33:56,287
Because I think we need that.

1158
01:33:56,447 --> 01:33:57,607
That might be a requirement.

1159
01:33:58,307 --> 01:34:00,028
I will work on that.

1160
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:04,469
Faye's saying in the contract, there's only two cars in there, 14 and 16.

1161
01:34:04,549 --> 01:34:06,109
If they're driving new cars, they can.

1162
01:34:06,129 --> 01:34:08,710
Yeah, well, I'm starting to drive around with other guys.

1163
01:34:11,326 --> 01:34:13,147
Okay, here we go.

1164
01:34:13,367 --> 01:34:14,647
Let's get back to regular business.

1165
01:34:15,247 --> 01:34:15,787
Thank you, Faye.

1166
01:34:16,388 --> 01:34:16,868
Thank you.

1167
01:34:17,868 --> 01:34:19,389
Thank you.

1168
01:34:19,409 --> 01:34:23,350
2-1-6-3-1, personnel ordinance.

1169
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:35,033
Dear Mr. President and councilors, I respectfully request and recommend the city council approve the following amendments to the revised ordinances entitled personnel article two classification compensation plan section 66-33 entitled

1170
01:34:38,484 --> 01:34:41,956
Officers and employees non-union by adopting the following changes.

1171
01:34:43,962 --> 01:34:45,226
Parking department, amendment A.

1172
01:34:47,159 --> 01:35:05,253
The language of CAF 3 shall be amended to include the following position, parking control specialist, pay range $47,698.04 to $52,356.20 to annualize the 10% differential for after 6.30 p.m.

1173
01:35:05,433 --> 01:35:06,454
one full-time employee.

1174
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:07,595
Mr. President, if I may?

1175
01:35:08,636 --> 01:35:11,918
Mr. President, I just wanted to correct something before we have conversation.

1176
01:35:12,379 --> 01:35:15,741
It says FTE, but there will actually be four.

1177
01:35:16,662 --> 01:35:18,963
parking control specialists hired.

1178
01:35:19,123 --> 01:35:19,704
Four employees?

1179
01:35:19,984 --> 01:35:20,304
Yes.

1180
01:35:22,745 --> 01:35:23,806
Four full-time employees.

1181
01:35:24,526 --> 01:35:29,169
I mean, I think that's a budgetary issue, not an issue for the CAF, right?

1182
01:35:29,229 --> 01:35:30,790
I just wanted to make that.

1183
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:34,432
Amendment B. Well, I have a question on the differential, Rick.

1184
01:35:34,452 --> 01:35:39,535
So is that differential included in the 52,356.20 max, or is that in addition to?

1185
01:35:39,655 --> 01:35:40,675
That's in addition to.

1186
01:35:41,496 --> 01:35:45,298
So if someone works the night shift, they're entitled to a 10% differential.

1187
01:35:48,202 --> 01:35:51,406
And where do we come up with 10% that is industry standard.

1188
01:35:52,187 --> 01:36:02,861
And there is a Massachusetts law I hate mentioning it when I can't name it but there is, you have to pay a night differential for work.

1189
01:36:06,987 --> 01:36:13,552
I mean, I checked every, you know, for comparison of pay, I checked every contract in the surrounding communities.

1190
01:36:14,212 --> 01:36:16,394
We do have to be competitive as well.

1191
01:36:16,914 --> 01:36:25,581
And so, to be clear, through the acting chief of staff, with the approval of M&A, the ordinance, which also showed that the 10% differential for employees after 6.30 p.m.

1192
01:36:25,601 --> 01:36:26,902
would be included in the ordinance, correct?

1193
01:36:29,907 --> 01:36:30,507
That's a good question.

1194
01:36:30,527 --> 01:36:38,192
I mean, I guess I would say not knowing what the legality of that responsibility would be, I don't see why not.

1195
01:36:38,252 --> 01:36:42,375
Yeah, I mean, it's a non-union employee, so they're not represented by a collective bargaining agreement or contract.

1196
01:36:42,435 --> 01:36:45,276
So this would be a fringe benefit to their employment.

1197
01:36:45,917 --> 01:36:49,559
So it's something that I believe should be included in the ordinance if it's passed this evening.

1198
01:36:49,579 --> 01:36:52,201
Yeah, certainly if the city council votes it that way, I don't see why not.

1199
01:36:53,573 --> 01:36:53,893
Thank you.

1200
01:36:54,373 --> 01:36:58,654
Amendment B, the language of CAF 4, shall be amended to include the following positions.

1201
01:37:00,054 --> 01:37:02,435
Parking control specialist foreman, $49,966.44 to $55,055.

1202
01:37:02,535 --> 01:37:04,375
Annualized with a 10% differential after 6.30 p.m.

1203
01:37:04,395 --> 01:37:08,496
Do we want to vote on each amendment as they're introduced, or do we want to do them by department?

1204
01:37:22,565 --> 01:37:24,106
Well, we're in the parking, so we'll do that.

1205
01:37:24,126 --> 01:37:25,227
We'll just do the whole department.

1206
01:37:25,287 --> 01:37:26,968
We'll do the parking, and then we'll go to the next one afterwards.

1207
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:27,248
Okay.

1208
01:37:27,328 --> 01:37:27,548
Okay.

1209
01:37:28,188 --> 01:37:31,870
Amendment C, the language of CAFOR shall be amended to include the following positions.

1210
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:40,295
Parking meter repair person, $49,995.40, due $55,055 annualized, one full-time employee.

1211
01:37:40,675 --> 01:37:48,559
Mr. President, I know it doesn't matter, but just to be clear, because I want everyone to see that I'm transparent, that's actually two employees.

1212
01:37:48,939 --> 01:37:49,420
That's two.

1213
01:37:51,824 --> 01:37:53,526
on the parking repair person.

1214
01:37:53,967 --> 01:37:59,493
I think what about him and be that is that one person that's one person that's what we're okay, thank you.

1215
01:38:00,675 --> 01:38:02,397
To a minute.

1216
01:38:02,457 --> 01:38:07,363
The language of cast 7 shall be amended to include the following positions.

1217
01:38:11,307 --> 01:38:11,448
We

1218
01:38:12,689 --> 01:38:16,451
lead parking meter repair person, $53,537.64 to $67,475.20 annualized.

1219
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:18,493
One full-time person, I think?

1220
01:38:18,533 --> 01:38:19,713
Yes, that's the foreman, yes.

1221
01:38:20,194 --> 01:38:21,895
Okay, and that's it for the parking.

1222
01:38:21,915 --> 01:38:22,115
That's it.

1223
01:38:31,535 --> 01:38:35,216
We have a motion, too, on the parking.

1224
01:38:35,757 --> 01:38:46,080
Mr. President, I certainly don't have a problem creating the positions, but we're gonna have a serious, significant discussion, I think, when it comes time asking for money to fund them.

1225
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:51,442
I mean, we're looking at a department that was funded at $350,000 as a placeholder, as Councilor Mox noted, $250,000 in salaries, $100,000 in expenses.

1226
01:38:58,397 --> 01:39:04,719
Based upon what I'm hearing this evening, we're gonna have about 12 employees in this department, which is nine more than we budgeted for.

1227
01:39:04,739 --> 01:39:16,162
There's gonna be a significant increase on the bottom line, which is gonna require a supplemental appropriation from this council, which is also gonna require us to amend a $192 million budget.

1228
01:39:17,282 --> 01:39:19,483
So that's something that we're gonna have to really think long and hard about.

1229
01:39:19,523 --> 01:39:21,223
I certainly don't have a problem creating the positions.

1230
01:39:21,243 --> 01:39:25,164
Like I said, if this is what we need to be successful to take this in-house, let's take a look at it.

1231
01:39:25,704 --> 01:39:26,945
But, you know,

1232
01:39:28,323 --> 01:39:41,488
have a parking enforcement director and three parking enforcement officers in the budget, and now to hear that we're gonna be having a department of 12 people plus a director, it's... But half a million dollars.

1233
01:39:41,708 --> 01:39:45,449
It's... Excuse me, Mr. President, it's only nine employees.

1234
01:39:45,849 --> 01:39:46,429
It's only nine.

1235
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:47,890
It's not 12.

1236
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:50,751
Well, there's four full-time parking control specialists, right?

1237
01:39:50,971 --> 01:39:51,231
Right.

1238
01:39:51,871 --> 01:39:53,192
Then they said there were gonna be six

1239
01:39:53,942 --> 01:40:00,607
No, one foreman and then two repair people and one foreman.

1240
01:40:00,707 --> 01:40:02,929
And then I have a parking clerk that will make money.

1241
01:40:03,629 --> 01:40:05,450
And one lead parking meter person.

1242
01:40:05,771 --> 01:40:06,011
Yeah.

1243
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:07,912
Okay, so six more, not nine.

1244
01:40:08,493 --> 01:40:09,393
And what about appeals?

1245
01:40:09,794 --> 01:40:12,916
Are we doing anything on appeals?

1246
01:40:12,936 --> 01:40:14,737
That includes the parking clerk.

1247
01:40:15,078 --> 01:40:16,959
Nine employees includes the parking clerk.

1248
01:40:17,285 --> 01:40:20,527
And the parking clerk is already capped.

1249
01:40:20,627 --> 01:40:21,768
One person does the appeals?

1250
01:40:21,988 --> 01:40:22,329
Correct.

1251
01:40:22,989 --> 01:40:24,530
And that's enough to handle that in the city?

1252
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:28,413
Absolutely.

1253
01:40:29,334 --> 01:40:36,559
So yes, there would be one there would be one clerk who would be the hearing appeals officer and that position is already capped.

1254
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:39,501
That clerk is essentially

1255
01:40:47,443 --> 01:40:48,004
Let's buckle.

1256
01:40:49,906 --> 01:40:50,667
Hey, quick question.

1257
01:40:50,827 --> 01:40:52,970
So as far as the media repair person.

1258
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:55,874
So, is it, does a, there's two people that do that wrong.

1259
01:40:56,074 --> 01:40:56,634
My correct.

1260
01:40:56,775 --> 01:40:57,956
There's three people.

1261
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,502
So leading to in, just because I

1262
01:41:03,205 --> 01:41:06,027
Don't know much about parking, you know more than me.

1263
01:41:06,067 --> 01:41:11,732
Repair people for parking meters busy, is that like a- They would start their day collecting.

1264
01:41:12,152 --> 01:41:17,456
Okay, so I'll tell you what the schedule that I went with in Newton.

1265
01:41:17,837 --> 01:41:25,363
My team worked six to two, they came in at six and collected until 1030, dropped the collection at the bank and then did the repair work.

1266
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:26,358
Okay.

1267
01:41:26,478 --> 01:41:29,641
I was wondering if this was repair all day and I'm like, wow, that's a lot of repair.

1268
01:41:29,681 --> 01:41:31,443
Um, no, we've got to collect.

1269
01:41:31,463 --> 01:41:32,544
That's fine.

1270
01:41:32,604 --> 01:41:34,045
I just want to make sure I understood it right.

1271
01:41:34,125 --> 01:41:34,966
Thank you very much.

1272
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:36,367
Yes, president.

1273
01:41:36,508 --> 01:41:40,751
Um, just back to what we were talking about earlier, um, around the appropriation.

1274
01:41:40,812 --> 01:41:46,076
So we budgeted for the director of the department and for three enforcement officers.

1275
01:41:46,096 --> 01:41:48,439
I just read, we're going to be calling them now control specialists.

1276
01:41:48,459 --> 01:41:48,539
So

1277
01:41:49,134 --> 01:41:51,516
I don't like the term parking control officer.

1278
01:41:51,596 --> 01:41:56,760
It sounds police like, and I don't see parking control that way.

1279
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:03,504
I think there are more ambassadors to the city and they should be out there being helpful to parkers when they can, but enforcing when they have to.

1280
01:42:03,785 --> 01:42:04,085
Got it.

1281
01:42:04,225 --> 01:42:07,027
And so we're just, we're changing the name of that, but we have budgeted.

1282
01:42:07,207 --> 01:42:09,188
So this is asking for four of them.

1283
01:42:09,208 --> 01:42:10,709
We've already budgeted for three of them.

1284
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:18,435
And what I think I heard you saying earlier is that your hope is to fund the rest of these positions out of the revenue of the department.

1285
01:42:19,703 --> 01:42:22,504
So that's almost entirely accurate.

1286
01:42:22,665 --> 01:42:30,448
Basically, it's because we are halfway through the fiscal year, we basically have double the funding, so to speak.

1287
01:42:30,748 --> 01:42:39,113
And in order to ensure that we have a fully operational department, in order to make sure that we have the minimum staffing that has been identified by the professional,

1288
01:42:40,173 --> 01:42:49,278
we're hiring additional positions, which wouldn't impact the FY 22 budget because we have the float from the first half of this fiscal year.

1289
01:42:49,458 --> 01:42:56,061
And then in the next fiscal year, we would have collected funds on our own, which we would then use to offset the costs.

1290
01:42:57,022 --> 01:43:08,628
So those projections, to the degree we're able to make projections on a revenue stream that hasn't been set up in a way that is entirely transparent to the city,

1291
01:43:09,435 --> 01:43:17,323
is something we need to make sure you're hoping with the six months remaining after this starts in January, that you'll be able to.

1292
01:43:18,048 --> 01:43:22,910
actually figure out what we're bringing in because Republic and Reef are not giving you the information that you would need to make that.

1293
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:36,597
And I will say, I believe the analysis that was conducted took into consideration the revenue that we were getting as a conservative measure from Reef today to put us in a comfortable position to be making these recommendations.

1294
01:43:36,817 --> 01:43:37,097
Got it.

1295
01:43:37,337 --> 01:43:38,818
Yep, this makes sense to me.

1296
01:43:38,898 --> 01:43:43,240
I'm happy to move approval on these four CAF changes.

1297
01:43:44,201 --> 01:43:45,281
Quick question, Mr. President, if I may.

1298
01:43:45,581 --> 01:43:46,942
Has a revolving account been established?

1299
01:43:48,415 --> 01:43:53,339
It would be actually a receipts reserved for appropriation, slightly different, but same concept.

1300
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:59,224
I do not believe one exists presently, but it is obviously something that we need to complete.

1301
01:44:00,345 --> 01:44:02,687
Thank you.

1302
01:44:02,767 --> 01:44:03,388
All right.

1303
01:44:03,468 --> 01:44:06,310
Chair awaits a motion on the parking department caps.

1304
01:44:07,891 --> 01:44:10,193
So on the motion by Councilor Baez, seconded by?

1305
01:44:10,213 --> 01:44:10,714
Second.

1306
01:44:11,374 --> 01:44:12,335
Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

1307
01:44:12,655 --> 01:44:13,396
All those in favor?

1308
01:44:14,136 --> 01:44:14,377
Aye.

1309
01:44:16,912 --> 01:44:23,977
Oh yeah, this is, yeah, so this will take its first reading this evening.

1310
01:44:24,377 --> 01:44:26,179
Yes, I'm sorry, we need a roll call on that.

1311
01:44:29,361 --> 01:44:33,323
A, B, C, and D. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1312
01:44:36,646 --> 01:44:37,206
Councilor Behrs?

1313
01:44:37,466 --> 01:44:37,686
Yes.

1314
01:44:38,167 --> 01:44:38,827
Councilor Fevella?

1315
01:44:39,027 --> 01:44:39,287
Yes.

1316
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,089
Vice President Knight?

1317
01:44:41,269 --> 01:44:41,429
Yes.

1318
01:44:41,769 --> 01:44:42,289
Councilor Marks?

1319
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:42,650
No.

1320
01:44:45,344 --> 01:44:45,884
Councilor Morrell?

1321
01:44:46,064 --> 01:44:46,284
Yes.

1322
01:44:47,885 --> 01:44:48,566
Councilor Scarpelli?

1323
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:49,046
No.

1324
01:44:49,866 --> 01:44:50,507
President Kiribayama?

1325
01:44:50,747 --> 01:44:50,987
Yes.

1326
01:44:52,768 --> 01:44:55,189
Five in the affirmative, two in the negative, motion passes.

1327
01:44:57,310 --> 01:44:58,411
Okay, thank you.

1328
01:44:59,947 --> 01:45:06,730
I just wanna say to the city council, thank you so much for giving me this opportunity to come before you to get started.

1329
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:08,811
I'm very excited to do that.

1330
01:45:09,331 --> 01:45:14,693
And I'm also excited to come back and show you some real results once I have these tools to do so.

1331
01:45:14,713 --> 01:45:15,773
Thank you so much.

1332
01:45:15,794 --> 01:45:18,995
We'll reach out to you after the first of the year.

1333
01:45:19,335 --> 01:45:21,056
Sure, thank you so much.

1334
01:45:21,076 --> 01:45:21,756
I appreciate it.

1335
01:45:22,336 --> 01:45:22,656
Thank you.

1336
01:45:24,157 --> 01:45:29,039
Mr. President, motion to refer all ARPA funded positions to a committee of the whole.

1337
01:45:33,271 --> 01:45:34,873
Some of these aren't ARPA.

1338
01:45:34,893 --> 01:45:36,454
Some of them aren't, some of them are.

1339
01:45:36,474 --> 01:45:37,715
Which ones are ARPA positions?

1340
01:45:37,755 --> 01:45:46,863
I think it's F and then I through O. Just some additional information for the city council's consideration.

1341
01:45:46,903 --> 01:45:54,430
As far as the ARPA funded positions are concerned, we're looking to present these out of transparency to the city council and to the community.

1342
01:45:55,831 --> 01:45:57,433
At this point in time, you know, I don't,

1343
01:45:59,097 --> 01:46:01,598
I think it would be important for this to be taken up.

1344
01:46:01,918 --> 01:46:07,799
The process and project will get delayed if we're unable to take them up this evening.

1345
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:20,763
I'm sorry, on the motion by Vice President Knight to refer the APRA positions to a committee of the whole, seconded by?

1346
01:46:20,783 --> 01:46:23,084
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1347
01:46:23,284 --> 01:46:28,205
And there's items, Mr. President, the amendments F and then I through O.

1348
01:46:29,044 --> 01:46:39,968
Mr. President, would the city council at least provide the department heads that are here this evening the opportunity to discuss this matter before this is referred to the committee of the whole?

1349
01:46:40,028 --> 01:46:51,772
We have at least two department heads plus further staff here tonight who have been patiently waiting to discuss their department's positions on how they further the community's response to COVID-19 pandemic.

1350
01:46:52,252 --> 01:46:53,972
I would encourage the council to consider that.

1351
01:46:54,392 --> 01:46:55,453
It's up to the board.

1352
01:46:56,975 --> 01:47:00,480
I'd like to hear from folks if they're here.

1353
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:26,988
Yeah, so Vice President Knight has made a motion to refer the upper positions to a committee of the whole, which is seconded by Councilor Falco.

1354
01:47:28,569 --> 01:47:29,249
All those in favor?

1355
01:47:29,389 --> 01:47:34,511
Hold on a minute, that's F-I-J-K-L-M.

1356
01:47:35,732 --> 01:47:38,773
Is there an N and an O?

1357
01:47:39,393 --> 01:47:40,214
The one paper that was.

1358
01:47:41,446 --> 01:47:44,910
Yes, it was an amendment that was added.

1359
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:48,593
N and O is for the COVID-19 public information officer.

1360
01:47:48,613 --> 01:47:49,574
I have it, yeah.

1361
01:47:49,634 --> 01:47:49,995
Got it.

1362
01:47:50,035 --> 01:47:56,581
Yeah, that's the federal funds and the public information.

1363
01:47:56,601 --> 01:48:02,007
And we will hear them also, too, after we do the vote.

1364
01:48:03,112 --> 01:48:05,393
So roll call vote has been requested.

1365
01:48:06,194 --> 01:48:13,258
So on the motion by Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Bailón, roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Max.

1366
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:15,900
Mr. President.

1367
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:18,822
To refer the opposite positions to me though.

1368
01:48:19,663 --> 01:48:20,423
Thank you, Mr. President.

1369
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:24,746
I'm going to be voting against this just because I'd like to move on this tonight and I just like the record to reflect that.

1370
01:48:24,946 --> 01:48:25,166
Okay.

1371
01:48:25,526 --> 01:48:25,866
Thank you.

1372
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:28,508
I'm voting against it because she told me to.

1373
01:48:29,289 --> 01:48:29,709
Shocking.

1374
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:32,946
Mr. President, if I may just take the vote first.

1375
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:34,668
The clerk is writing the motions.

1376
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:37,490
I'd just like to note that this is going to delay the hiring of staff.

1377
01:48:57,935 --> 01:48:58,796
Let's quickly draw the roll.

1378
01:48:58,956 --> 01:48:59,516
Councilor Behrs?

1379
01:48:59,977 --> 01:49:00,217
No.

1380
01:49:01,097 --> 01:49:01,718
Councilor Falco?

1381
01:49:01,738 --> 01:49:01,798
Yes.

1382
01:49:03,399 --> 01:49:04,080
Vice President Knight?

1383
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:04,460
Yes.

1384
01:49:05,541 --> 01:49:06,101
Councilor Marks?

1385
01:49:06,321 --> 01:49:06,421
Yes.

1386
01:49:07,382 --> 01:49:07,922
Councilor Morrell?

1387
01:49:08,143 --> 01:49:08,323
No.

1388
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:09,684
Councilor Scarpelli?

1389
01:49:09,724 --> 01:49:09,804
Yes.

1390
01:49:10,845 --> 01:49:11,505
President Carabino?

1391
01:49:11,665 --> 01:49:11,925
Yes.

1392
01:49:14,047 --> 01:49:15,428
Five in the affirmative.

1393
01:49:16,369 --> 01:49:17,049
Motion passes.

1394
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:23,614
So before we have a... So we'll talk about the two...

1395
01:49:28,388 --> 01:49:30,036
We're going to do those right now, Chris.

1396
01:49:30,886 --> 01:49:33,987
So we have Officer Planning and Development Sustainability.

1397
01:49:34,267 --> 01:49:38,088
Amendment E, language of CAF 12 should be amended to include the following positions.

1398
01:49:38,548 --> 01:49:50,312
Community Development Block Grant Administrator, $68,253.57 to $79,766.04 annualized, one full-time employee.

1399
01:49:51,092 --> 01:49:59,255
Please note that the position of Community Development Block Grant has been discovered to have been created previously, but not included within the compensation plan.

1400
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:02,371
Mr. President, God's best.

1401
01:50:03,672 --> 01:50:04,953
Unless you have a presentation first.

1402
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:07,535
We have a couple of them.

1403
01:50:07,595 --> 01:50:08,555
Let me go over them all.

1404
01:50:08,795 --> 01:50:09,516
Oh, okay.

1405
01:50:09,996 --> 01:50:10,657
All right, that's fine.

1406
01:50:11,257 --> 01:50:17,261
Amendment G, the following CAF 13 shall be amended to include the following position.

1407
01:50:17,601 --> 01:50:20,383
Staff planner, $73,429.98 to $87,444.07 annualized one full-time employee.

1408
01:50:27,112 --> 01:50:34,639
Economic Development Planner and Staff Planner have previously existed in the city but are not currently found in the CAF system, so.

1409
01:50:36,134 --> 01:50:39,738
Mr. President, the first thing I will say is just before Ms.

1410
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:47,166
Hunt speaks is that we have obviously taken the City Council's comments into consideration.

1411
01:50:47,747 --> 01:50:55,856
Vice President Knight, at some point you had asked that basically information on which positions in the city haven't been capped.

1412
01:50:56,237 --> 01:50:56,937
We continually

1413
01:50:58,418 --> 01:51:02,000
process to bring further departments.

1414
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:07,661
Once we're reviewing them, as we go through them, we sift through to make sure the positions have been capped.

1415
01:51:07,701 --> 01:51:09,142
If they haven't, they're coming before you.

1416
01:51:09,162 --> 01:51:15,684
That's why you're seeing a couple of these that are not capped as we looked at the ARPA funded positions that we're presenting tonight.

1417
01:51:18,945 --> 01:51:21,146
Mr. President.

1418
01:51:21,366 --> 01:51:22,426
Thank you both for bringing this up.

1419
01:51:22,807 --> 01:51:26,348
For the CDBG administrator and the staff planner,

1420
01:51:27,175 --> 01:51:36,877
were those positions that had been budgeted for and hired for in the city prior to this being proposed and even prior to this mayoral administration?

1421
01:51:37,877 --> 01:51:43,798
The CDBG administrator is one that is actually paid out of the CDBG block grant every year.

1422
01:51:44,178 --> 01:51:47,639
And there's an argument to be made that therefore it didn't have to be in the CAF.

1423
01:51:47,719 --> 01:51:49,979
There's also an opinion that it should be in the CAF.

1424
01:51:50,499 --> 01:51:53,040
Out of transparency, we're bringing it before you.

1425
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:59,967
I'm aware that the current person holding this position has worked for the city for six years so that takes us back through several administrations.

1426
01:52:00,408 --> 01:52:10,119
It is my understanding that that position has actually been filled for many years I'm, I'm unable to go back in records long enough to tell you, we've held that grant for 47 years.

1427
01:52:12,703 --> 01:52:13,043
Got it.

1428
01:52:13,423 --> 01:52:16,025
There's no change here to anything.

1429
01:52:16,685 --> 01:52:17,446
This is the position.

1430
01:52:17,466 --> 01:52:21,248
This is the salary that she's been paid at the cap system that she's been through.

1431
01:52:21,849 --> 01:52:29,593
And in the years when budgets were presented with titles and caps next to the titles, this is what was on your budget.

1432
01:52:29,894 --> 01:52:32,195
Only it was stated that it was funded through CDBG.

1433
01:52:32,535 --> 01:52:32,755
Right.

1434
01:52:32,855 --> 01:52:40,320
And, and so this is the administration coming to us with what we've asked for, which is to review all the positions in the city.

1435
01:52:40,807 --> 01:52:45,501
and see which are in the calf or are not historically been in the calf.

1436
01:52:45,961 --> 01:52:46,281
Correct.

1437
01:52:46,481 --> 01:52:51,903
I will say that staff planner and economic development planner have also both shown up on those spreadsheets.

1438
01:52:51,963 --> 01:52:57,184
I reviewed the years that they were available were fiscal year 17 through fiscal year 20.

1439
01:52:57,725 --> 01:53:01,706
And those showed up often as to be filled positions.

1440
01:53:02,586 --> 01:53:05,307
It is my hope that we'll be able to fill them in the future.

1441
01:53:05,327 --> 01:53:12,749
There are some allowances in ARPA to rehire administrative municipal staff.

1442
01:53:13,549 --> 01:53:15,350
We're also looking at them through ARPA funding.

1443
01:53:15,370 --> 01:53:24,915
There are different options, but these are positions that have been in the budget in previous years that have never shown up to the best of my knowledge on the cap system.

1444
01:53:25,355 --> 01:53:25,595
Great.

1445
01:53:25,695 --> 01:53:26,096
Thank you.

1446
01:53:26,196 --> 01:53:28,477
I would motion to approve amendments E and G.

1447
01:53:29,518 --> 01:53:30,078
Vice President Knight.

1448
01:53:30,398 --> 01:53:34,781
I certainly have no issue with Amendment G in my understanding is the same as yours Alicia, because it's paid out of a grant.

1449
01:53:34,801 --> 01:53:38,062
There was really no need for a cap because the grant defined what the compensation rate was going to be.

1450
01:53:38,963 --> 01:53:41,324
Taxpayers dollars weren't being used to pay.

1451
01:53:41,344 --> 01:53:42,865
It was being awarded to us from the feds.

1452
01:53:43,805 --> 01:53:50,028
In terms of the staff planner in the economic development planner, these positions are not funded in the budget presently, correct?

1453
01:53:50,789 --> 01:53:51,649
But not this year.

1454
01:53:51,889 --> 01:53:52,149
Right.

1455
01:53:52,249 --> 01:53:52,510
Okay.

1456
01:53:52,570 --> 01:53:53,170
Were they last year?

1457
01:53:54,746 --> 01:53:59,010
They were funded in, sorry I'm going to get my years, we're in fiscal 20.

1458
01:53:59,050 --> 01:54:01,292
You said 17 through 20, so forget about the fiscal years.

1459
01:54:01,312 --> 01:54:02,873
Some of those previous years that were funded.

1460
01:54:03,574 --> 01:54:13,183
All right, because I guess my question is, if we have no incumbent in the position, and there's no hiring plan to

1461
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:19,474
So if we approve the ARPA funding, we could start filling these positions immediately.

1462
01:54:19,774 --> 01:54:25,579
Okay, so these are similar to the other titles that got brought forward that are ARPA funded.

1463
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:30,143
Or is amendment F and G both ARPA funded?

1464
01:54:30,443 --> 01:54:34,646
I'm sorry, in my reading of this.

1465
01:54:34,666 --> 01:54:36,087
The following ARPA funded position.

1466
01:54:36,107 --> 01:54:37,429
13 doesn't talk about ARPA money anywhere.

1467
01:54:42,923 --> 01:54:55,930
one of the positions staff planner is something so when these but so to the two positions were cut out of the budget at the beginning of the pandemic in order to balance the budget without having to lay people off.

1468
01:54:56,430 --> 01:55:02,494
At that time, we actually brought on board through cares act funding, a staff person

1469
01:55:02,934 --> 01:55:08,237
as a temporary grant-funded position with CARES Act to backfill some of the work that we were doing.

1470
01:55:08,697 --> 01:55:18,462
So she has been working for us and is funded through CARES Act funding, and we would like to transition her from CARES Act to ARPA funding, and that is the position of staff planner.

1471
01:55:20,983 --> 01:55:29,667
So it's not a permanent position, and the current position is stated in the appointment letter as grant-funded, as grant funding is available.

1472
01:55:32,655 --> 01:55:38,457
Thank you.

1473
01:55:38,477 --> 01:55:38,957
Thank you.

1474
01:55:39,957 --> 01:55:47,019
So on a motion by Councilor bears to accept E and G. Seconded by Vice President night.

1475
01:55:57,256 --> 01:56:05,863
Okay, on the motion by Council Marks to sever E and G to vote on them separately, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1476
01:56:06,484 --> 01:56:07,184
All those in favor?

1477
01:56:09,707 --> 01:56:10,327
All those in favor?

1478
01:56:12,449 --> 01:56:13,150
Motion passes.

1479
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:18,595
Okay, so on the motion by Councilor Bailey, seconded by Councilor Knight on amendment E,

1480
01:56:20,392 --> 01:56:21,512
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1481
01:56:21,992 --> 01:56:22,572

Yes.

1483
01:56:23,773 --> 01:56:24,473
Councilor Falco?

1484
01:56:24,673 --> 01:56:24,893
Yes.

1485
01:56:25,833 --> 01:56:26,513
Vice President Nights?

1486
01:56:27,393 --> 01:56:27,633
Yes.

1487
01:56:28,914 --> 01:56:29,474
Councilor Marks?

1488
01:56:29,774 --> 01:56:29,914
Yes.

1489
01:56:30,814 --> 01:56:31,414
Councilor Morrell?

1490
01:56:31,614 --> 01:56:31,854
Yes.

1491
01:56:32,494 --> 01:56:33,254
Councilor Scarpelli?

1492
01:56:33,414 --> 01:56:33,654
Yes.

1493
01:56:34,335 --> 01:56:35,055
President Kerrio?

1494
01:56:35,115 --> 01:56:36,135
Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

1495
01:56:36,535 --> 01:56:38,075
Motion passes, takes its first reading.

1496
01:56:38,975 --> 01:56:45,057
On the motion for amendment G by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Night.

1497
01:56:45,437 --> 01:56:46,057
I'll second that one.

1498
01:56:51,485 --> 01:56:55,247
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1499
01:56:56,768 --> 01:56:57,889
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1500
01:57:02,132 --> 01:57:17,501
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1501
01:57:20,442 --> 01:57:20,702
Yes.

1502
01:57:21,463 --> 01:57:21,983
Councilor Marks.

1503
01:57:22,243 --> 01:57:22,444
Yes.

1504
01:57:23,284 --> 01:57:23,845
Councilor Morrell.

1505
01:57:24,105 --> 01:57:24,345
Yes.

1506
01:57:25,086 --> 01:57:25,806
Councilor Scarpelli.

1507
01:57:26,007 --> 01:57:26,247
Yes.

1508
01:57:26,707 --> 01:57:27,508
President Kerrio.

1509
01:57:27,688 --> 01:57:27,948
Yes.

1510
01:57:29,009 --> 01:57:32,272
So the affirmative motion passes, paper takes its first reading.

1511
01:57:32,652 --> 01:57:35,774
Thank you very much, Alicia.

1512
01:57:35,894 --> 01:57:45,482
Okay, on the health department, amendment H, language of CAF 3,

1513
01:57:47,979 --> 01:57:50,161
shall be amended to include the following position.

1514
01:57:50,621 --> 01:57:52,283
Community recovery coach, $47,698.13 to $52,356.38 annualized.

1515
01:57:52,303 --> 01:57:53,083
Five, is that a half million?

1516
01:57:53,103 --> 01:57:53,584
So part-time employee.

1517
01:57:53,604 --> 01:57:55,105
We'll approve them, Mr. President.

1518
01:57:55,125 --> 01:57:57,407
Okay, so on the motion by- Mr. President.

1519
01:58:16,526 --> 01:58:20,733
Just I want to say thank you for being here, for sitting through the meeting so far.

1520
01:58:22,155 --> 01:58:26,642
And I really appreciate all the ARPA positions that you brought forward tonight.

1521
01:58:27,003 --> 01:58:30,328
One of the reasons I was hoping we could consider them tonight is

1522
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:39,405
the situation that we are still in, and I know the incredible difficulty of hiring health and health-related workers at this time.

1523
01:58:40,065 --> 01:58:44,248
So I just wanna say, really appreciate this, hope we can consider it quickly.

1524
01:58:44,668 --> 01:58:50,992
I know that this council voted to move it to committee of the whole tonight, but I just wanna say they're really valuable and I hope we can do it soon.

1525
01:58:51,993 --> 01:58:57,456
So on the motion to accept amendment H by, who made the motion?

1526
01:58:57,797 --> 01:58:59,758
Me, by Vice President, seconded by?

1527
01:59:01,025 --> 01:59:02,006
Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

1528
01:59:02,286 --> 01:59:03,447
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1529
01:59:04,327 --> 01:59:04,888
Councilor Bears?

1530
01:59:04,988 --> 01:59:05,228
Yes.

1531
01:59:05,988 --> 01:59:06,669
Councilor Fevella?

1532
01:59:06,749 --> 01:59:06,969
Yes.

1533
01:59:08,090 --> 01:59:08,730
Vice President Knight?

1534
01:59:09,071 --> 01:59:09,291
Yes.

1535
01:59:09,811 --> 01:59:10,351
Councilor Marks?

1536
01:59:10,471 --> 01:59:10,672
Yes.

1537
01:59:10,992 --> 01:59:11,532
Councilor Morrell?

1538
01:59:11,712 --> 01:59:11,952
Yes.

1539
01:59:12,353 --> 01:59:13,013
Councilor Scarpelli?

1540
01:59:13,033 --> 01:59:13,293
Yes.

1541
01:59:13,634 --> 01:59:14,334
President Quirio Villanueva?

1542
01:59:14,514 --> 01:59:14,754
Yes.

1543
01:59:15,195 --> 01:59:17,356
Seven in the affirmative, paper takes its first reading.

1544
01:59:17,616 --> 01:59:25,682
Mary Ann, do you wanna discuss the, give a brief synopsis on the other positions while you're here?

1545
01:59:27,043 --> 01:59:29,685
On amendment one, I'm sorry, amendment I.

1546
01:59:31,807 --> 01:59:34,009
It's special services budget manager.

1547
01:59:34,989 --> 01:59:47,376
So, so all of these are sorely needed because of, you know, the work that's being done in the health department now has been certainly escalated between COVID and what our daily demands always have been and continue to be.

1548
01:59:48,276 --> 01:59:53,739
The three positions that I'm most concerned about and really want to make sure that we're moving forward with are the

1549
01:59:55,240 --> 02:00:05,607
positions that we talked about at my budget hearing, which was the community social worker, the food response person, food response specialist, and the emergency preparedness coordinator.

1550
02:00:06,547 --> 02:00:20,776
At the time of my budget hearing, they were and continue to be funded through CARES, and the work that they're doing is so important, and most certainly was brought to light due to the pandemic, and we need that work to continue.

1551
02:00:20,837 --> 02:00:23,018
So Alicia, our community social worker,

1552
02:00:23,478 --> 02:00:30,923
is here tonight and she is working and we really need to transition her to opera soon as we can, moving forward.

1553
02:00:30,943 --> 02:00:44,193
So I'd appreciate if we could expedite and the emergency response coordinator is really somebody that's sorely needed because of all the clinics and testing and programs that we're doing.

1554
02:00:44,853 --> 02:00:48,135
We need volunteers, we need help, we need someone to help organize and do all that work.

1555
02:00:48,175 --> 02:00:51,158
So it's here, it's now, it has to happen really quick.

1556
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:52,519
So I appreciate that.

1557
02:00:53,418 --> 02:00:54,202
So what about Jay?

1558
02:01:01,370 --> 02:01:03,812
So it's a part-time position.

1559
02:01:03,872 --> 02:01:10,098
We're looking to add another support help to the public health nurses as well.

1560
02:01:10,278 --> 02:01:24,732
That would be a lot of COVID follow-up, the emails, the calls, the concerns that people have, getting back to folks on their test results, assisting with vaccinations, really just supporting the work of the public health nurse at this point.

1561
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:34,192
The administrative support, again, is another role that I would love to move quickly on because that person is also working under CARES in our office now.

1562
02:01:34,772 --> 02:01:43,174
I don't know if you can imagine that our office is currently inundated with calls and emails and that additional support.

1563
02:01:43,314 --> 02:01:51,056
Again, so we can continue to do the permitting and the inspections and the daily work and what's expected of the health department to do under normal conditions.

1564
02:01:51,936 --> 02:01:56,738
So that administrative support is currently working under KIAS and again needs to move to ARPA.

1565
02:01:58,899 --> 02:02:02,360
The data analyst is someone who's again working with us now.

1566
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:07,062
She's the one that's helping put together all those graphs and charts that you see on the website.

1567
02:02:07,142 --> 02:02:09,603
She's collecting the statistics for us.

1568
02:02:09,643 --> 02:02:13,285
She's also helping with the, it's called Color.

1569
02:02:13,705 --> 02:02:17,927
It's the platform that we use for vaccination clinics for appointments and all that.

1570
02:02:17,967 --> 02:02:20,808
She's assisting with that, giving us technical assistance on that.

1571
02:02:22,989 --> 02:02:23,910
contact tracer.

1572
02:02:24,150 --> 02:02:29,015
We've had 111 cases in December, so we're looking for additional support on contact tracing.

1573
02:02:30,616 --> 02:02:48,911
Community liaisons are helping us do outreach to non-English speaking marginalized communities, really helping get not only COVID response, but city services out to those communities in a way that's easy and that can be understood.

1574
02:02:50,315 --> 02:02:58,998
And I think I spoke to the preparedness coordinator, social worker, and specialist, and then the rest, again, these are just positions.

1575
02:02:59,038 --> 02:03:18,986
The outreach coordinator would be managing the community liaisons and assisting with that work, health equity work, an epidemiologist to really help us focus on data and the health of this community, looking at it through data, and a youth prevention specialist.

1576
02:03:19,926 --> 02:03:30,376
which would assist with all the issues that just have been exacerbated by COVID, as well as ongoing youth prevention work, so.

1577
02:03:31,537 --> 02:03:31,897
Thank you.

1578
02:03:32,057 --> 02:03:32,698
Thank you, Marianne.

1579
02:03:32,998 --> 02:03:33,599
Mr. President.

1580
02:03:35,501 --> 02:03:35,981
Council Meeks.

1581
02:03:36,962 --> 02:03:40,866
Marianne, how long will these positions be funded for with the APA money?

1582
02:03:41,266 --> 02:03:42,147
APA's three years.

1583
02:03:42,467 --> 02:03:42,847
Three years?

1584
02:03:44,154 --> 02:03:48,155
And is there any thought after the three years if these positions will be kept on or?

1585
02:03:48,976 --> 02:03:52,277
That's what I'd love to work towards sustainability of these positions.

1586
02:03:53,017 --> 02:04:01,399
Hopefully we'd like the contact tracing, hopefully we won't need, but I think none of these other positions are gonna be sorely needed for a while.

1587
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,921
And my other question, this may be a question for the interim chief of staff.

1588
02:04:06,921 --> 02:04:12,443
As part of the APA funding, I was under the impression that frontline workers and first responders

1589
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:18,054
could receive enumeration for their work during COVID.

1590
02:04:18,734 --> 02:04:19,275
Is that true?

1591
02:04:21,056 --> 02:04:24,839
There is a category for funding in those areas.

1592
02:04:24,979 --> 02:04:26,260
There are criteria.

1593
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:30,403
There's a lot of compliance and regulatory requirements around them.

1594
02:04:30,883 --> 02:04:32,685
I have some documentation here tonight.

1595
02:04:33,265 --> 02:04:35,307
Could pull it up if you'd like to learn more.

1596
02:04:35,407 --> 02:04:37,048
We could also discuss that at another time.

1597
02:04:37,738 --> 02:04:53,388
Well, I guess my concern is that, you know, we're two years into COVID now, and if there's funding available for first responders and frontline workers, you know, the people that worked at CVS during the toughest of times, you know, our fire police,

1598
02:04:54,168 --> 02:04:57,951
EMT workers, people that work at Stop and Shop and any other stores.

1599
02:04:58,632 --> 02:05:06,037
I think really we should do our best to free up some of that money and make sure whatever we dole out is done pretty immediate.

1600
02:05:06,938 --> 02:05:15,444
So I would hope that's something the city administration is looking at and will take care of the first responders and frontline workers as soon as they can.

1601
02:05:16,705 --> 02:05:20,948
Is it the intent of the administration to dole that money out to those workers?

1602
02:05:21,961 --> 02:05:37,447
At this point, one of the positions that's before the council today, which has been referred to the Committee of the Whole, is the most critical position of all, and not to say that any of these other positions are not critical to the organization, but that's critical in terms of the planning of the use of, further planning of the use of ARPA funds.

1603
02:05:38,437 --> 02:05:39,757
That's the federal funds manager.

1604
02:05:40,257 --> 02:05:48,860
That person's duties would include community conversations, because that's a part of the regulatory process and the federal requirements for ARPA funding.

1605
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:59,862
And it would be the responsibility of that person working with the administration, working with the city to determine the compliance aspects of that.

1606
02:06:00,262 --> 02:06:00,763
There are

1607
02:06:02,463 --> 02:06:03,244
considerations.

1608
02:06:03,424 --> 02:06:05,606
It's not just a matter of approving the funds.

1609
02:06:06,066 --> 02:06:18,096
The compliance component to ARPA funds is reporting and making sure that we have a solid reporting system so that when we're reporting back on what the city spent the funds on, that we're prepared to do that.

1610
02:06:18,496 --> 02:06:28,745
And that also means that if we actually fund what's called a subrecipient funding, then we have to make sure that that subrecipient also reports back.

1611
02:06:28,785 --> 02:06:30,446
So there's a lot of work that needs to be done.

1612
02:06:31,367 --> 02:06:34,030
to develop the processes to put those types of things in place.

1613
02:06:34,190 --> 02:06:34,431
Right.

1614
02:06:35,552 --> 02:06:39,517
I just want to make sure there's a commitment from the city administration to move forward with that.

1615
02:06:40,598 --> 02:06:50,189
I've read in the newspaper and seen on local news that there are many surrounding communities that are moving forward currently right now with frontline workers and first responders.

1616
02:06:51,378 --> 02:06:53,900
And I would hope that we're in the process as well.

1617
02:06:53,920 --> 02:07:05,732
And I realize there's a process to doing so, but I just want to make sure the commitment's there because, you know, we relied on these frontline workers and first responders for the past two years.

1618
02:07:06,412 --> 02:07:19,115
And these are the people in the community that aren't making large corporate salaries and put their life on the line to make sure that we had food and medicine and everything else access to.

1619
02:07:19,615 --> 02:07:23,136
And I think it's only appropriate that we now take care of them.

1620
02:07:23,836 --> 02:07:26,257
And I'd really like to see some action on that.

1621
02:07:26,677 --> 02:07:32,838
So maybe if you can go back to the mayor and let her know that members of this council would like to see that happen.

1622
02:07:33,615 --> 02:07:35,277
I'll definitely mention that you raised that.

1623
02:07:35,297 --> 02:07:37,820
Thank you.

1624
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:43,947
Mr. President, I know it's been voted, but if you'll just just bear with me for one moment.

1625
02:07:44,788 --> 02:07:49,794
The request that I would make this evening is if the city council would be willing to reconsider

1626
02:07:50,923 --> 02:08:00,708
three positions specifically for the health department and one position for the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

1627
02:08:01,268 --> 02:08:08,691
I think those four positions are really critical at this juncture and it would be greatly appreciated if the city council could consider those this evening for CAFs.

1628
02:08:08,791 --> 02:08:09,952
Mr. President, if I can.

1629
02:08:11,733 --> 02:08:14,234
I don't see this being a long wait.

1630
02:08:14,334 --> 02:08:16,575
I called for a meeting on maybe Tuesday.

1631
02:08:17,957 --> 02:08:20,998
just so we can sit down and discuss this a little more.

1632
02:08:21,559 --> 02:08:26,781
So meet on two, I don't think this is- Mr. President, I offered the amendment for the reason that there's no WAPA spending plan.

1633
02:08:26,801 --> 02:08:29,322
So, you know, if we get $39 million- Ask these questions.

1634
02:08:30,783 --> 02:08:33,744
And then move forward with it.

1635
02:08:33,764 --> 02:08:35,585
So it's not something I want to hold it off.

1636
02:08:35,665 --> 02:08:37,446
I just want us to make sure we have everything in place.

1637
02:08:38,326 --> 02:08:41,767
Okay, Wednesday.

1638
02:08:41,807 --> 02:08:43,068
We took the vote, we'll figure it out.

1639
02:08:44,809 --> 02:08:45,109
We can't.

1640
02:08:46,608 --> 02:08:48,011
We'd have to vote on Wednesday.

1641
02:08:48,051 --> 02:08:49,053
Who's running this meeting?

1642
02:08:49,073 --> 02:08:50,795
We're doing taxes on Tuesday.

1643
02:08:50,836 --> 02:08:52,759
Mr. President, I'm just here to advocate.

1644
02:08:52,779 --> 02:08:53,901
That's all I'm trying to do.

1645
02:08:53,921 --> 02:08:57,066
I'm just here to advocate for the needs of the city.

1646
02:08:57,086 --> 02:08:57,407
That's all.

1647
02:08:59,547 --> 02:09:02,348
Would it be, would the members of this council be willing to meet on Monday?

1648
02:09:02,868 --> 02:09:05,289
I'd like to try to consider this on next Tuesday.

1649
02:09:06,890 --> 02:09:08,691
Tuesday we're meeting on the taxes.

1650
02:09:09,071 --> 02:09:09,551
I heard you.

1651
02:09:09,811 --> 02:09:12,713
So we can meet up, if you want to meet on Wednesday, I'll call a meeting for Wednesday.

1652
02:09:12,753 --> 02:09:16,934
So then next time this would be considered on a regular meeting agenda would be in two weeks on December 20th?

1653
02:09:17,215 --> 02:09:18,475
Yes, 21st or whatever.

1654
02:09:18,515 --> 02:09:19,115
All right.

1655
02:09:22,497 --> 02:09:23,958
Thank you for your indulgence.

1656
02:09:23,978 --> 02:09:24,438
I appreciate it.

1657
02:09:26,221 --> 02:09:28,182
Okay, we have two more here.

1658
02:09:29,924 --> 02:09:36,870
From the mayor's office, amendment N. Nina, do you want to explain those, amendment O?

1659
02:09:37,030 --> 02:09:38,952
Do you want to explain those too?

1660
02:09:40,644 --> 02:09:41,144
Happy to.

1661
02:09:41,304 --> 02:09:49,209
Amendment N is the COVID-19 public information officer that was hired under CARES and would like to transition to ARPA.

1662
02:09:49,570 --> 02:09:53,572
Like many of these positions, the federal funds manager is one that we have advertised.

1663
02:09:53,592 --> 02:09:58,375
We're in the process of interviewing and looking forward to bringing somebody on for that.

1664
02:09:58,475 --> 02:10:01,897
A final candidate hasn't been selected, but we were doing interviews as of today.

1665
02:10:03,118 --> 02:10:03,438
Thank you.

1666
02:10:04,379 --> 02:10:04,639
Thank you.

1667
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:05,780
Thank you very much.

1668
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:06,901
Thank you.

1669
02:10:09,087 --> 02:10:12,769
So I'll work on getting a meeting on Wednesday to talk about that stuff.

1670
02:10:13,170 --> 02:10:16,972
All right, reports of committees.

1671
02:10:16,992 --> 02:10:19,974
21, 626, December 1st, 2021, committee of the whole report.

1672
02:10:20,394 --> 02:10:25,357
This was a committee of the whole report in regards to what was going on in the review of the clerk's office.

1673
02:10:25,457 --> 02:10:29,039
Motion to accept the- Second.

1674
02:10:30,584 --> 02:10:35,587
The motion by Vice President Knight, received and placed on file, seconded by Councilor Mayes.

1675
02:10:35,647 --> 02:10:36,227
All those in favor?

1676
02:10:36,527 --> 02:10:36,627
Aye.

1677
02:10:37,268 --> 02:10:38,068
Motion passes.

1678
02:10:38,848 --> 02:10:39,989
Public participation.

1679
02:10:40,069 --> 02:10:44,971
Is Mr. Biglioni here?

1680
02:10:45,152 --> 02:10:46,492
Mr. Biglioni, are you on the call?

Can you hear me?

1684
02:10:54,656 --> 02:10:55,577

02:11:00,157 --> 02:11:01,078

Mr. McNeely.

1692
02:11:21,890 --> 02:11:24,272

It's insane.

1694
02:11:27,574 --> 02:11:29,135
I never get to speak at this council.

1695
02:11:30,450 --> 02:11:31,090
Unbelievable.

1696
02:11:34,631 --> 02:11:37,152
Again, a vote was taken.

1697
02:11:37,672 --> 02:11:38,472
It's so crooked.

1698
02:11:39,793 --> 02:11:40,953
Smash a bank for me.

1699
02:11:42,953 --> 02:11:46,794
If you like, I can have this paper where you live in Malden.

1700
02:11:46,834 --> 02:11:50,395
If you want to have this sent over to the Malden City Council, we can do that.

Oh, no, no.

1702
02:11:52,716 --> 02:11:53,636
You're so crooked.

1703
02:11:55,097 --> 02:11:55,697
Go to jail.

1704
02:11:58,928 --> 02:12:02,270
It's clear, Mr. President, the gentleman's here to do nothing other than cause disruption.

1705

Thank you.

The second meeting's going on, and would you like me to?
