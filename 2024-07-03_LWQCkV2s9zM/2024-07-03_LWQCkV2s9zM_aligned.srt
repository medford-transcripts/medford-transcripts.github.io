If we all may rise to salute the flag, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

16
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:23,534
We have one item under new business.

17
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:30,656
It's a recommendation to approve the appointment of Mr. Noel L. Velez as the director of finance for the Medford Public Schools.

18
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:33,837
I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Edouard Vincent, superintendent.

19
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:35,397
Yes.

20
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:38,458
And I did reach out to member Olopade.

21
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:44,800
He is going to be joining us shortly, having some Wi-Fi difficulties in his location.

22
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,161
But yes, good afternoon.

23
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:57,939
Mayor Longo Kern and members of the School Committee, I am very pleased this evening to have the opportunity to introduce Mr. Noel L. Velez.

24
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:06,647
I enthusiastically recommend that the Medford School Committee vote to approve his appointment as Finance Director of the Medford Public Schools.

25
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:12,772
Mr. Velez comes to us with more than 12 years of finance and managerial experience.

26
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:22,220
He was previously the director of finance and business manager over accounts payable, payroll, and transportation for the Winthrop Public Schools.

27
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:26,484
Prior to that, he was a financial analyst for the Chelsea Public Schools.

28
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:35,311
Mr. Velez earned a bachelor's degree from Salem State University, and he holds an active state licensure as a school business administrator.

29
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:43,455
He is also an active member of the Massachusetts Association of School Business Officials, which is called MASBO.

30
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:53,120
And he participates on their vocational subcommittee, finding out new things that are going on in the vocational world to bring back to Medford Public Schools.

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,942
He is very eager to expand his skills and improve the Medford Public Schools.

32
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:03,785
Mr. Velez came to Medford Public Schools this year at the recommendation of Mr. Jerry McHugh.

33
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:12,903
who worked with Noel in the Chelsea Public Schools and they have had a partnership of more than five years together.

34
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:24,475
Mr. McHugh will continue to work closely with Noel as he transitions out of our district next year and Noel transitions into this role.

35
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:43,210
During the interview process, Mr. Velez impressed our team with his assessment of other ways to continue to enhance the district through improving and pursuing grant opportunities, as well as working to institute procedures to improve all aspects of the business office.

36
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:52,458
In his new role as finance director, Mr. Velez will work closely with the superintendent and the district leadership team

37
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,550
to monitor the budget for the benefit of all of Medford's students.

38
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:10,814
In the upcoming year, we anticipate Mr. Velez will operate under the guidance of Mr. McHugh to continue the sound and balanced budgetary practices that have been recently implemented.

39
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:24,721
We are thrilled to welcome Noel Velez to his new role in Medford and know that his skills and experience will be major assets to the work of our team and impact our students positively as well.

40
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:26,963
So I ask this.

41
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:41,829
body, the committee, to please feel free to, you know, ask Mr. Velez questions, but this is our recommendation for him to be our Director of Finance for the Medford Public Schools.

42
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:42,649
Thank you.

43
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,591
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

44
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:50,632
Thanks for being here, Mr. Velez.

45
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:52,553
Anything you want to add or

46
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:58,166
No, I think the superintendent said it perfectly.

47
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:22,534
I'm just very eager if you're willing to have me to join this team at another level and continue, I believe, some of the great work that Jerry started in regards to, as you guys have said, the transparency of explaining how the budget truly looks and making sure that we're being very fiscally responsible with the budget that we're eluded, with the grants that we also get, and making sure that the

48
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:28,535
the whole community itself feels comfortable knowing that the public schools are being very well taken care of financially.

49
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:29,875
Great, thanks.

50
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:38,018
Could you give us a minute update of just your background and how long you were in Chelsea, just so the full committee- Yeah, of course.

51
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:39,578
Yeah, your history, work history?

52
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:51,862
Yeah, so I originally, when I graduated Salem State, I was a director of an after-school program for a few years, and then I went to the private sector to go work for Marsh USA,

53
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:55,319
which is one of the largest insurance companies in the world.

54
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:12,293
And while there, I started learning a lot about, I started sharpening my finance techniques, got promoted, and then Chelsea had an opportunity to go be a financial analyst slash assistant business manager in 2017.

55
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:15,835
So I had applied and I was very fortunate enough to get the job.

56
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,177
I worked in Chelsea from 2017 to 2021,

57
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:35,898
overseeing a lot of the transportation budget, student activities, helping out with the grants, helping out with anything that was Title I to Title IV related, and also end of year reporting and teacher stipends.

58
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,119
Those were a lot of things that fell underneath my umbrella.

59
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,520
And when I had an opportunity to go to Winthrop

60
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:57,079
The summer of 2021, I took over as the director of finance and the business manager in Winthrop, in which I became much more involved in the full development of the budget in Winthrop Public Schools, sitting in negotiations with teachers' contracts.

61
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:05,303
While I was in Winthrop, we negotiated the nurses' contract, the teachers' contract, the paraprofessional contract.

62
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:11,586
And as I was leaving, we were just on the process of merging the DPW,

63
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:20,391
with the custodial staff as under one unit in Winthrop, which I was overseeing with the new city manager and the new town CFO.

64
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:39,718
So that was something that those were some areas that I was able to really gain a lot of experience while also assisting my superintendent in all aspects of finance and even being involved a lot with the operations, capital improvement, MSBA, things of that nature.

65
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:41,159
I was very comfortable and familiar with.

66
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:43,019
Great, thank you.

67
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,320
Member Brantley.

68
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:48,703
Hi, Mr. Velez.

69
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:49,504
It's Member Brantley.

70
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:54,108
I just want to welcome you to MPS and know that anything I say on the floor is not personal.

71
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:55,249
Of course.

72
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,691
So, welcome aboard.

73
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,232
Thanks so much for all you're going to do.

74
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:00,193
Thank you.

75
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:03,316
Thank you, Member Brantley.

76
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:08,745
we can just mark member Olopade present, please, if you haven't already, Member Rousseau.

77
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:15,433
And if any of the members have any other questions, please ask them now.

78
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:19,758
If not, is there a motion on the floor?

79
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:24,243
Member Rheinfeld?

80
00:08:25,323 --> 00:08:28,065
I have a quick question and then I'm happy to make a motion to approve.

81
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:32,748
I'm curious what collaborative budgeting looks like to you.

82
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:41,394
Like how do you work with other people on the leadership team and in the administration and schools?

83
00:08:41,514 --> 00:08:43,255
Like how does that play out?

84
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:44,696
Yeah, of course.

85
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:48,839
So when I was in Winthrop, we developed what was called a zero budget system.

86
00:08:49,821 --> 00:09:12,698
Where what it is, is although the town allocates how much money we're going to be getting as a whole school district, I was meeting, starting in November, I would meet with all my principals after figuring out what our salaries would look like and what any new contracts that were coming in and their pay raises, whatever was left over, I would allocate that in regards to working with my buildings and grounds.

87
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:27,627
department and each principal would come to me with a list of curriculums that they were either using or curriculums they were interested in using in the future and how that pertained to what the superintendent called was the Winthrop Public Schools vision.

88
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:33,247
other areas in regards to office supplies, normal supplies.

89
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:40,234
And what I would also give to them is while they were bringing me all this information, I would bring to them information in regards to, here was your budget last year.

90
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:41,796
Here's where you spent a lot.

91
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:43,057
Here's where you didn't spend a lot.

92
00:09:43,397 --> 00:09:45,179
Do you want to move some of this money around?

93
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,081
We would also look at technology.

94
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:48,783
It's always a big thing, trying to figure it out.

95
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,624
Where do you feel you are with technology?

96
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:57,705
You budgeted $30,000 last year, but you spent close to $50,000.

97
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:04,446
Do you feel like you want to spend another $50,000, or do you want to move that area into maybe the math program and everything else?

98
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:08,027
And so what I would do is I would meet with the principals in November.

99
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:10,647
They would give me kind of a layout of what they were expecting.

100
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:12,207
I would take it all in.

101
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:13,468
I would find the prices for them.

102
00:10:13,508 --> 00:10:16,088
I would work with the vendors to get their prices.

103
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:19,729
And then when I would go back to them, I'd say, hey, go reach out to all your lead teachers.

104
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:24,495
and your lead directors and see, does this curriculum make sense?

105
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:31,379
When they would bring that all to me, then I would sit down with my assistant superintendent and superintendent, and we would kind of lay out the whole budget.

106
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:51,299
And sometimes, you know, you requested 230,000, you might get it, you might get a little bit more, you might get a little bit less, but we always try to be very fair in regards to per pupil personnel, making sure that the numbers made sense in regards to how many students you had in your building to what you were expecting to spend.

107
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:57,261
And also making sure that each school had the right amount of technology available.

108
00:10:57,301 --> 00:11:01,302
So if the high school had gotten a big technology bump, one year we would want to make sure

109
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:08,685
that the elementary schools got a proper piece of that pie also for technology.

110
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:11,666
So it was always, year to year, it was changing, it was moving.

111
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,107
We never just copied and pasted.

112
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:14,827
We didn't believe in that.

113
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:21,290
But I did feel that by year three, the principals had become very accustomed to it.

114
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,191
And we were able to really create what I thought was great open dialogue.

115
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:31,513
And there was never really any thoughts about, oh, I feel like my budget was undercut or my budget isn't fully funded.

116
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:33,815
Thank you so much.

117
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:38,158
Thank you, Mr. Villes.

118
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:39,759
Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.

119
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:42,981
