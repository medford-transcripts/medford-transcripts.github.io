[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_15]: 24482, offered under suspension by the entire Medford City Council, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we hold a moment of silence in honor of our beloved City Messenger, Lawrence Lepore, who passed away last night from cancer, an Army veteran,

77
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:15,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Larry loved, lived, and breathed Medford.

78
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:16,725
[SPEAKER_15]: He loved City Hall.

79
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:21,809
[SPEAKER_15]: He loved his job as city messenger, and he loved working with this council and his colleagues in the clerk's office.

80
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:26,973
[SPEAKER_15]: He was a calming and steady presence at council meetings, and he provided wise counsel to anyone who sought his advice.

81
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:36,421
[SPEAKER_15]: We offer our deepest and most sincere condolences to Larry's family, to his friends, and to all who loved him, be it further resolved that the Medford City Council dedicate tonight's meeting in Larry's memory.

82
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:39,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins.

83
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:41,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

84
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:42,939
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a hard one.

85
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:49,582
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been hard over these past few months not having Larry with us in the chambers like he always, always has been for years and years.

86
00:06:51,823 --> 00:07:06,931
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to wrap my head around this, and it's hard to sum up so much of what Larry represented, but Larry was so kind.

87
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:13,236
[SPEAKER_11]: He was so generous with his insight and his experience from so many years of working in City Hall.

88
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:21,780
[SPEAKER_11]: When I joined the Council three years ago, you know, I felt a little out of place, a little, a little new kid on the block.

89
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:27,782
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is just one example of how unflaggingly kind a person Larry is.

90
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,824
[SPEAKER_11]: He never, ever treated me any different than any other counselor.

91
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,327
[SPEAKER_11]: He was kind, he was welcoming, he was welcoming, he took me seriously.

92
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:38,829
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that that's how he treated absolutely everybody in his orbit.

93
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,030
[SPEAKER_11]: So he will be so missed.

94
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,354
[SPEAKER_11]: And I joined my colleagues in sending our most sincere condolences to his family.

95
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:50,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro, then Councilor Saint, then Councilor Lemmon.

96
00:07:52,399 --> 00:08:04,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know Larry for very long, but I really appreciated that he, what I did know of him was that he was really fun and he was really kind.

97
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:10,364
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really nice to my kids when he dropped off packets at my house.

98
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:15,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can be remembered that way, I would consider myself very lucky.

99
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,835
[SPEAKER_00]: He had my back literally and figuratively.

100
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:22,157
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nice having him behind me when he was here.

101
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:28,421
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a kind of a tough time at a few meetings in the beginning of my tenure here.

102
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:39,887
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was very steady in presence, really, really, really nice about stuff and really kind to me and funny and cheerful and steady.

103
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:40,888
[SPEAKER_00]: And

104
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:49,331
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope he and I hope he rests in peace and I hope his family finds comfort and how well loved he was here.

105
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:54,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

106
00:08:54,276 --> 00:09:00,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, really hard for me to see this news this morning, because I think, just

107
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:06,701
[SPEAKER_02]: From my own perspective, Larry's been such a calming presence here on the city council.

108
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:09,423
[SPEAKER_02]: He, you know, is such a good friend.

109
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:12,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think above all it's that him being a friend.

110
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:14,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to remember really well.

111
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:22,334
[SPEAKER_02]: The first few weeks of my term when he really was that part part of that team that like welcome to me and to doing this job.

112
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:28,697
[SPEAKER_02]: to making me feel comfortable to be myself, to speak up, to serve the people.

113
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:36,542
[SPEAKER_02]: He really taught me a lot about who to talk to and, you know, who to ask questions to here.

114
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:43,526
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's even outside of that work, after our council meetings, almost every council meeting, him and I

115
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:53,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few other counselors would stand around and chat, talk about life, talk about things outside of Medford politics, and then things about Medford politics, but mostly just about life.

116
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:57,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think getting to know him that way was a real, real honor.

117
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish everyone had the chance to spend that time with him.

118
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:09,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really difficult, I think, for me to speak tonight, because this is a friend that we're losing.

119
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:14,925
[SPEAKER_02]: and such a loyal public servant to our city.

120
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:19,886
[SPEAKER_02]: A real mainstay of the city council, who's been here longer than any of us.

121
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:30,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to thank him for all of that service, for his friendship, and to send my condolences to his family.

122
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:32,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And may he rest in peace.

123
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

124
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Leming.

125
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:40,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

126
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:52,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So, when I first in the time before, and I ran for council in the time that I was running one thing that I learned is that there are

127
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:59,849
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of people in the city who hold politics above personal relationships.

128
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:05,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I said that I'm running as a progressive, those are my ideals.

129
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:17,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you end up making a decision that maybe some person doesn't like, you kind of notice that there's a lot of folks in the city who will turn on you after that.

130
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:18,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's happened

131
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:26,652
[SPEAKER_04]: to me quite a few times with relationships that I've had with various folks around the city.

132
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:35,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed that Larry was one of the few people who truly did not matter to him.

133
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:47,165
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few other people like that where you could tell it's just whatever happens politically, whatever happens in the chambers, it just doesn't

134
00:11:48,223 --> 00:11:49,744
[SPEAKER_04]: matter to them.

135
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:52,705
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll always value their relationship.

136
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:56,766
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll always value who you are as a human being above all of that.

137
00:11:56,986 --> 00:12:02,968
[SPEAKER_04]: They really know how to remain neutral and respect the person.

138
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:17,013
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it made me respect and miss him a lot more, even though I haven't known him as long as some of my colleagues had.

139
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,533
[SPEAKER_04]: gave him a phone call, gave him a phone call over the summer.

140
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:25,776
[SPEAKER_04]: And after he'd been hospitalized, talked for a little bit.

141
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:34,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, I just asked him about the history of the, you know, Medford politics, because we're having some contentious meetings here.

142
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:39,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said to me, Matt, it's always been that way.

143
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:50,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was a guy who, he'd been around the block a few times, and he knew that at the end of the day, it's the person that matters.

144
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:53,067
[SPEAKER_04]: It's none of this, all of this is ephemeral.

145
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So I miss him.

146
00:12:55,169 --> 00:13:04,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I also did not know him nearly as well as I wish I had, but I think

147
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:08,745
[SPEAKER_08]: we will really never be able to replace him.

148
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:16,267
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter who we get for this position, we won't be able to replace him because of his personality and because of who he was.

149
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:20,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm, you know, someday we'll have someone in that position.

150
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:23,929
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll be different, but Larry is definitely truly missed.

151
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:27,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

152
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

153
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

154
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Larry Lepore,

155
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:37,648
[SPEAKER_03]: someone we should all celebrate to know and be honored that he was our friend.

156
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:44,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while since you take that ride down Main Street and you notice his car's gone.

157
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,431
[SPEAKER_03]: At Alexander's, one of his favorite spots.

158
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:55,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the knock on your door and just so he can pat my dog.

159
00:13:55,512 --> 00:14:01,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Or sometimes he would sneak away because he knew Dina was coming with Biscotti.

160
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:07,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And he would always be so kind.

161
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:10,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what we hear over and over about Larry.

162
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:16,506
[SPEAKER_03]: He never let politics get in the way of anything.

163
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:18,406
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just such a good person.

164
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:31,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if you had a bad day, he'd tell you, he'd lend you that word that you're doing the job that people elected you to do and made you feel that

165
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,952
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you felt in yourself that it was the right thing to do.

166
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:41,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to miss him.

167
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:53,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to miss him so much because I think a lot of us, even though if you didn't know Larry long, it's amazing how you captured his spirit.

168
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:56,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Even a night like tonight.

169
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:07,356
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he'd look at me and we'd make eye contact with some stupid comment I'd make and I'd feel, oh, I owe him something later.

170
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:14,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Or when someone would come up and they'd say something silly and he'd look at me with this like, are you kidding me type of face.

171
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:19,343
[SPEAKER_03]: But he never did it with disrespect or without honor.

172
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:21,405
[SPEAKER_03]: He was such a good person.

173
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:27,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know the cancer that he fought at the end was very tough, very painful.

174
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:34,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And my condolences to his family.

175
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:37,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

176
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:40,175
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to go?

177
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:41,176
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

178
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:42,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk.

179
00:15:44,397 --> 00:15:45,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

180
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:47,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved Larry.

181
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:48,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he was amazing.

182
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:54,421
[SPEAKER_06]: He became one of my dearest friends.

183
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,793
[SPEAKER_06]: having trouble looking at his empty chair right now.

184
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll miss him for a long time.

185
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:11,805
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a, I looked forward to his visits to the clerk's office on Friday afternoons after the building shut down.

186
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:18,177
[SPEAKER_06]: He and I solved a lot of the world's problems between 1230 and two o'clock on Fridays.

187
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:32,342
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a, I mean, in addition to being a paratrooper who threw himself out of perfectly good airplanes in the army, he was a, you know, he worked at the housing authority, but he was also a disc jockey.

188
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:34,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was an authority on country music.

189
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:47,965
[SPEAKER_06]: He knew I was a Springsteen fan, but he also knows that I love country music, and he knows that my favorite country music stars are Chris Christopherson and Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash.

190
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:53,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he came in one Friday and told me 37 things about Waylon Jennings that I didn't know.

191
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:59,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he came in and told me 37 things about Johnny Cash I didn't know the next week.

192
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:04,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And he only told me a couple of things I didn't know about Christopherson, because I was raised on him when I was two.

193
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the picture over there on his desk,

194
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:15,823
[SPEAKER_06]: he came into the office on a Friday afternoon, wearing a Johnny Cash at Folsom prison t-shirt.

195
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:21,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, stand there and don't move until I've recorded this on film.

196
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:27,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And he is standing there in the office wearing a Johnny Cash t-shirt from, you know, I mean, throwback to 1968.

197
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was,

198
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:37,345
[SPEAKER_06]: outrageously funny.

199
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:39,447
[SPEAKER_06]: He was outrageously kind.

200
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:51,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the conversations that we had, some of the conversations you had with him out in that parking lot, they're not conversations we can repeat, but he was outrageously funny and he was kind to everybody.

201
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:57,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was a mentor and a dear, dear friend, and I'm just gonna miss him forever.

202
00:17:58,684 --> 00:17:59,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

203
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:01,126
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

204
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,588
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna go to Kevin Harrington

205
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:07,043
[SPEAKER_15]: from Medford Community Media, Kevin.

206
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:10,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

207
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:11,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello there.

208
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:12,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me OK?

209
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:15,369
[SPEAKER_15]: We can hear you, yeah.

210
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:15,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

211
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:27,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I normally don't, Kevin Harrington, Medford Community Media, 49 Windsor C. I don't usually jump on these meetings from this side of the Zoom call, but I would be remiss if I didn't call out Larry.

212
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:29,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Like many have mentioned,

213
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:46,873
[SPEAKER_13]: When I came in here, when I started coming into the booth and figuring out the chambers, Larry was always so welcoming, so easy to talk to, and just someone who was always so pleasant and made me feel a little less intimidated.

214
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,927
[SPEAKER_13]: every time I walked in the chambers.

215
00:18:49,508 --> 00:19:03,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I also, you know, was lucky enough to be raised to appreciate that there's people in life that for any given event, for any given party, for any meeting, there's the people that show up early and have to stay late.

216
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:09,403
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, Larry did that to a T from, for all the time I was there.

217
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:12,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, you know, I didn't have to go into the booth every day, but,

218
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:21,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Even from monitoring the meetings from home, you could tell Larry was there, getting there early to put out the name placards, making sure there was water.

219
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:27,641
[SPEAKER_13]: And he would stay and keep me company while I was breaking things down and turn the lights off.

220
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:31,143
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, I just want to echo what everyone's saying.

221
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:37,147
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure his family are going through it right now.

222
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:41,470
[SPEAKER_13]: But I hope it offers them a little bit of healing to know how much he touched

223
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:46,288
[SPEAKER_13]: So many people here in Medford, in the city of Medford, and he will be sorely missed.

224
00:19:48,949 --> 00:19:49,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Kevin.

225
00:19:50,969 --> 00:19:53,770
[SPEAKER_15]: I have some words from former President Morell here.

226
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:59,552
[SPEAKER_15]: She was hoping to be here, but I think in fitting for Larry, we had a long night.

227
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:07,294
[SPEAKER_15]: She says, I want to send my deepest condolences to Larry's family, to thank them for sharing Larry with the city all these years.

228
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:11,689
[SPEAKER_15]: who's an incredible steward of the city council and the chambers and was so dedicated to his role.

229
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:15,532
[SPEAKER_15]: He'll be truly missed both as an individual and for all he brought to this body.

230
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:29,941
[SPEAKER_15]: And I get the difficult task of going last, but Larry once said to me, so long as you're not throwing chairs at each other, it's a good night.

231
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:33,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think he saw someone almost throw a chair at someone.

232
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:36,054
[SPEAKER_15]: maybe this side to this side.

233
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:44,798
[SPEAKER_15]: I think anyone who's only sat on this side has missed out sitting over here and seeing Larry's face and being able to make that eye contact with him.

234
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,462
[SPEAKER_15]: And sitting up here too, it's been interesting the first few months of this term, but I didn't get to know Larry as well as I wanted.

235
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:54,583
[SPEAKER_15]: I've known him for five years.

236
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:57,244
[SPEAKER_15]: The first few years were the pandemic.

237
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:58,304
[SPEAKER_15]: We were on Zoom.

238
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:04,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Larry's still coming to my house every day, every Friday, bringing the papers and whatnot, but didn't get

239
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:14,149
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, really to get to know him until we were back here and we were able to talk more before and after meetings during expected and unexpected recesses.

240
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:18,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but I always like to think of it kind of how counselor Scarpelli did.

241
00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:25,896
[SPEAKER_15]: If you were hearing words of encouragement from Larry, he didn't have a great day, but he, he presented it in a nice way.

242
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,878
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're having words of respect from Larry, you had a decent day.

243
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:30,258
[SPEAKER_15]: He did.

244
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:30,638
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

245
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,120
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you had words of pride from Larry, you had a really good day.

246
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:37,260
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was lucky enough to experience all three.

247
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:59,679
[SPEAKER_15]: I probably have a warped sense in my mind that may be more pride than encouragement, but it was really just helpful to be able to talk to Larry about just have all that knowledge, decades of knowledge of this body and these meetings, to talk to someone with a different perspective on a lot of issues, but then find a lot of common ground.

248
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:10,021
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that he will be missed by this body, by the former members, by a lot of people in City Hall and certainly by his family.

249
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:19,724
[SPEAKER_15]: He was just a really wonderful, kind, caring person who I really enjoyed spending time with in the limited ways that I was able to.

250
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:26,246
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know there are a lot of people who got to enjoy a lot more time with Larry who aren't going to be able to share that time with him anymore.

251
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:30,787
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm thinking of them because if I feel this way, I can only imagine how they feel.

252
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:32,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

253
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,316
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion of everybody.

254
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we have some people to speak.

255
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:42,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, public participation will take you.

256
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:44,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

257
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I've lived in this city for 77 years now.

258
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:54,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would have to say Larry Lepore was one of the nicest people I've ever met.

259
00:22:57,105 --> 00:23:00,147
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I met him, it was sort of an odd situation.

260
00:23:01,195 --> 00:23:06,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I had just got back from six months of military duty, and I had just got married.

261
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:19,588
[SPEAKER_09]: And my wife and I went to our favorite place, North Conway, a little restaurant on West Side Road, called the Clam Box, or something to that effect, Lobster Trap, I'm sorry.

262
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:27,054
[SPEAKER_09]: And after dinner, some guy starts yelling at me, go on over here.

263
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I turn and I look, and it's two guys.

264
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:35,096
[SPEAKER_09]: and cowboy hats with their wives.

265
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:39,216
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a young guy that I went to law school with by the name of Bobby Penta.

266
00:23:40,597 --> 00:23:43,677
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bobby said, come over here, I want to introduce you to somebody.

267
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:45,778
[SPEAKER_09]: He introduced me to Larry LaPore.

268
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:48,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I've been married 53 years now.

269
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:54,559
[SPEAKER_09]: And I gotta say, it's a long time to know somebody.

270
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:59,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I would come up here, even if there was only one

271
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:06,261
[SPEAKER_09]: of these left, Larry would give me his copy, because that's the type of guy he was.

272
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:13,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will miss him, going down to Alexander's and seeing him and his group.

273
00:24:13,924 --> 00:24:17,085
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just one of the nicest people I've ever met.

274
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:17,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

275
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:19,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

276
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:29,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm shocked and I'm sad.

277
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:43,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I first met him in 1980, my first time ever voted for Ross Perot, I think, from Texas, the chicken man.

278
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:45,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I finish, can I finish, can I finish?

279
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:52,630
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I started coming to the council meetings about that time.

280
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not a youth either, I was already past my teens.

281
00:24:57,532 --> 00:25:02,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to love the guy, you know, he's just such a beautiful man.

282
00:25:09,178 --> 00:25:12,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to miss him at our coffee talk at Alexander's.

283
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,420

00:34:08,308 --> 00:34:13,130
[SPEAKER_15]: call 7, 8, 1, 3, 9, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5 for any aids accommodation sign out about her to be city clerk.

432
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:14,071
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

433
00:34:14,111 --> 00:34:17,373
[SPEAKER_15]: With that, um, we'll hear from the petitioner and then we'll open the public hearing.

434
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:19,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

435
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:20,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for sticking with us.

436
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:23,588
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry for your loss.

437
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:25,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to get that out there first.

438
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:27,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

439
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:28,690
[SPEAKER_10]: So my name is Diana Cuddy.

440
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm with National Grid Gas 170 Data Drive, Waltham, Massachusetts.

441
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:36,532
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm here tonight requesting the grant allocation for a small section of Maine.

442
00:34:37,132 --> 00:34:42,893
[SPEAKER_10]: We're replacing the Maine on Hale Street, and we'd like to tie it into an existing newer Maine on Medford Street.

443
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:44,834
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're also replacing part of another Maine there.

444
00:34:44,854 --> 00:34:49,095
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the purpose for bringing the extension back to Medford Street.

445
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:50,175
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

446
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions by members of the council for the petitioner?

447
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:57,099
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotta open a public hearing.

448
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:04,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas this is a public hearing, I'll open the public hearing to people in favor, opposed, or otherwise having an opinion on this matter.

449
00:35:05,444 --> 00:35:06,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Public hearing is open.

450
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:08,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you in favor?

451
00:35:08,365 --> 00:35:10,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in favor of this petition, of this grant.

452
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:11,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Petitioner in favor.

453
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:14,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

454
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,052
[SPEAKER_11]: I would motion to approve contingent on the

455
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Conditions recommended by the chief engineer.

456
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:23,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I got a close public hearing first, but then we'll take it.

457
00:35:24,052 --> 00:35:29,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry Anyone else either here on zoom who would like to speak during the public hearing?

458
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:44,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none the public hearing is closed on the motion of vice president Collins seconded by councillor scarpelli to approve With the conditions by the city engineer Mr. Clerk, please call the roll

459
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:51,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

460
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:51,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

461
00:35:51,964 --> 00:35:52,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

462
00:35:52,164 --> 00:35:52,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

463
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:52,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

464
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:53,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

465
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:53,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

466
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:54,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Negative motion passes.

467
00:35:55,145 --> 00:35:55,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

468
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:56,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

469
00:35:56,986 --> 00:35:59,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And appreciate your comments on our loss.

470
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:00,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

471
00:36:00,707 --> 00:36:01,708
[SPEAKER_06]: All right. 24457.

472
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:21,184
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the request for amendment to previously approved grant location National Grid on Main Street in City Council September 10th, 2024 tabled.

473
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:27,029
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe we tabled to go to Councilor Tseng, who had some questions.

474
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:29,411
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll go to Councilor Tseng.

475
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:30,892
[SPEAKER_02]: The questions have been resolved.

476
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:32,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready to move.

477
00:36:32,294 --> 00:36:35,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to Owen about Director Wartola.

478
00:36:35,746 --> 00:36:39,109
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit about the memos.

479
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:47,635
[SPEAKER_02]: In reading the final National Grid memo and the KTL memo, I feel ready to move forward as a council.

480
00:36:47,995 --> 00:36:48,275
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

481
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:50,177
[SPEAKER_15]: We believe we have representatives from

482
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:57,592
[SPEAKER_15]: The team here will hear from the petitioner if there's anything you want to add to the record from prior discussions of the matter.

483
00:36:58,233 --> 00:36:58,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

484
00:36:59,073 --> 00:37:03,097
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Chris Radzig from National Grid Distribution Design Department on the electric side.

485
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:14,066
[SPEAKER_14]: I did put together a couple notes just to be able to recap some of what brought us here to this point today.

486
00:37:14,826 --> 00:37:18,849
[SPEAKER_14]: I went through and cut back on quite a bit.

487
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,321
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll share what I have here.

488
00:37:23,984 --> 00:37:38,459
[SPEAKER_14]: After watching the video and listening to what your concerns were following the past meeting, the amendment and current dispute is really rooted in the square footage of restoration that's being required and natural grids and ability to obtain a road opening permit.

489
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,871
[SPEAKER_14]: from the city engineer to allow the work to begin.

490
00:37:42,992 --> 00:38:02,560
[SPEAKER_14]: In response to Councilor Collins and the question what has changed, why there's been a change, and similar questions from others in the Council, National Grid's understanding after leaving the initial petition hearing was that the median curb was the boundary of the curb-to-curb repaving square footage equivalent.

491
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:08,926
[SPEAKER_14]: which was being discussed at the original hearing and was shown on our proposal sketch at that time.

492
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:18,110
[SPEAKER_14]: The city engineer's restoration requirement to issue a road opening permit for National Grid's work essentially doubled the restoration requirements.

493
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,072
[SPEAKER_14]: We disagreed and we haven't been able to resolve the difference.

494
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:30,436
[SPEAKER_14]: We're looking to clarify the specific restoration scope with this amendment so we can continue with our work.

495
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:37,457
[SPEAKER_14]: If the square footage is defined using the median curb as the boundary, National Grid is in agreement.

496
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:48,101
[SPEAKER_14]: If the square footage includes the other side of the median curb at Main Street, we feel this is excessive and have provided a written response outlining the reasons for our objections.

497
00:38:50,601 --> 00:39:00,105
[SPEAKER_14]: But setting aside really the interpretations, the roadbed foundation explanations and legal references, I'm really here to support

498
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:11,642
[SPEAKER_14]: repairing a section of conduit so we can repair a section of cable that's out of service right now, which limits some of our reserve energy.

499
00:39:12,002 --> 00:39:21,148
[SPEAKER_14]: If we see an outage, we're not able to bring back to full capacity if we're in a peak condition.

500
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:30,574
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that, considering the efforts to resolve with the city engineer and the well-defined curve in the median 30 feet away from

501
00:39:31,743 --> 00:39:32,564
[SPEAKER_14]: where we're trenching.

502
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,987
[SPEAKER_14]: We feel that's a reasonable paving boundary.

503
00:39:36,568 --> 00:39:53,442
[SPEAKER_14]: We're asking that the city council recognize the median curb as the limit for the restoration and National Grid will either grind and overlay and restore all painted markings completely to that point or pay the SPOF for the city by-law that's referenced in our amendment.

504
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:57,825
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

505
00:39:57,865 --> 00:39:59,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Does anyone have any questions for the petitioner?

506
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:02,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one councilor.

507
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:17,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you said that if this job, from what I gather, if this, if we don't find a resolution, National Grid walks away and there is ramifications, like you said, could you explain that?

508
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:24,442
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is a power outage with this piece being, you know, non-functioning that, that

509
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,519
[SPEAKER_03]: What part of the community is going to be affected if that's the case?

510
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:32,301
[SPEAKER_14]: It's mostly south of this point, where the police station is south.

511
00:40:35,162 --> 00:40:40,925
[SPEAKER_14]: In our underground infrastructure, we rely on backup reserve power.

512
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:46,949
[SPEAKER_14]: So when sections are lost, each section has a backup, a normal backup.

513
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:52,347
[SPEAKER_14]: And when a section is lost, we feed from other directions.

514
00:40:53,208 --> 00:41:00,295
[SPEAKER_14]: This is one which blocks off one of the options to the southmost portion of the town.

515
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:06,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so hypothetically, if we don't move forward with this, there's a power outage.

516
00:41:07,062 --> 00:41:08,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Parts of South Medford are

517
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:14,706
[SPEAKER_14]: are more vulnerable during our peak conditions, say the middle of the summertime and a heat wave.

518
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:24,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Or if we lose one section in another area, this is, again, one of the other backups to provide some reserve capacity.

519
00:41:25,294 --> 00:41:29,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that situation, does that then facilitate an emergency service?

520
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:31,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

521
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:36,283
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can't restore power, then it turns into an emergency situation, yeah.

522
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:41,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then, if, Mr. O'Connor.

523
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:42,984
[SPEAKER_14]: At that point, if we can't restore customers.

524
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:43,945
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we pay then?

525
00:41:45,486 --> 00:42:03,082
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can't restore customers, and this is a section that we know if we can restore it, repair it, we would consider it an emergency situation, and we would make our repairs there, likely starting in that location.

526
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:10,952
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the rule is still up for interpretation, still have to hop the car.

527
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:11,953
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my question.

528
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:15,014
[SPEAKER_14]: We would restore it as we generally would.

529
00:42:17,556 --> 00:42:31,764
[SPEAKER_14]: In this case, the agreement, one of the agreements was to saw cut up to the edge of the bike lane in that area, recognizing that it was brand new pavement and removing the brand new pavement.

530
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:34,766
[SPEAKER_14]: It just generally didn't make sense.

531
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:37,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

532
00:42:39,009 --> 00:42:39,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a follow up.

533
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:44,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Have there been any power outages of that nature recently that have... Not recently, no.

534
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,631
[SPEAKER_15]: When was the last one that you have?

535
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:47,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

536
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:47,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

537
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,012
[SPEAKER_15]: At least a couple of years.

538
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:50,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

539
00:42:51,272 --> 00:42:55,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the last one was this, the outage to this cable here.

540
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:56,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

541
00:42:56,754 --> 00:42:57,254
[SPEAKER_15]: And when was that?

542
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:00,275
[SPEAKER_14]: That was...

543
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,580
[SPEAKER_14]: close to two years ago.

544
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I think it was December.

545
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:06,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

546
00:43:06,661 --> 00:43:07,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

547
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:09,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

548
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:21,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Our first discussion was, I think, at least a month ago now, and it was a very late hour, so I apologize for any failure of perfect eloquence in my trying to summarize our previous discussion.

549
00:43:22,804 --> 00:43:31,245
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding is that the cable that needs to be repaired needs to be repaired, and the nature of the request for amendments largely deals with what area of

550
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:37,129
[SPEAKER_11]: street will be repaved as a condition of that cable repair, is that correct?

551
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:38,811
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, say that again.

552
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:52,727
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding is that the cable that needs to be repaired, must be repaired, will be repaired, and the nature of the amendments that National Grid has put forward has to do with what area and how much will be repaved while that cable repair is going on, is that correct?

553
00:43:53,847 --> 00:43:59,410
[SPEAKER_14]: following the repair of the cable and the conduit in that section that's failed.

554
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

555
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:00,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

556
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:00,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

557
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wanted to clarify.

558
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:06,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate you being here again, especially at such a late hour.

559
00:44:06,112 --> 00:44:07,633
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so sorry to keep you and your team here.

560
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:11,995
[SPEAKER_11]: For myself, I think we had a really helpful discussion about a month ago.

561
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:16,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I reviewed the memos from the city's lawyers, from National Grid.

562
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:25,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I think at this point, I am feeling confident and standing by the amendments that the council in the previous term put forward.

563
00:44:26,322 --> 00:44:37,988
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciate the discussions that you've had with us about this, but I think that those current, those existing amendments and the council's rationale behind them for me feels as resonant as it did a year ago.

564
00:44:39,048 --> 00:44:41,409
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would motion to deny the request for amendments.

565
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:44,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

566
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:46,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Just, I was wondering if the engineer

567
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you state what the position of the engineering department is relative to the amendment request?

568
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:57,937
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the engineering division is concerned, the decision is ultimately yours.

569
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:05,122
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to enforce any requirements or conditions that you as a body hold.

570
00:45:06,082 --> 00:45:12,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this case, the applicant made conditions at a November hearing last year.

571
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:17,110
[SPEAKER_05]: We're tasked to enforce those conditions.

572
00:45:18,837 --> 00:45:19,137
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

726
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:04,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, so much for free speech.

727
00:54:05,061 --> 00:54:11,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to be reading the Boston all the time Sunday communist newspaper.

728
00:54:12,506 --> 00:54:13,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, did I say Globe?

729
00:54:13,827 --> 00:54:14,288
[SPEAKER_01]: The Herald?

730
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:17,750
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the Globe.

731
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:22,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy the post with my numbers at the smoke shop before I go to the hotel to read the paper.

732
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:25,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, let me check my football pool.

733
00:54:25,463 --> 00:54:28,045
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point is, I happen to see this cartoon.

734
00:54:28,325 --> 00:54:34,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you people work diligently to go against the leaf blowers, I remember.

735
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it all went through, right?

736
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:38,453
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really cool cartoon.

737
00:54:38,533 --> 00:54:39,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's funny.

738
00:54:39,714 --> 00:54:41,195
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a couple of squirrels.

739
00:54:41,556 --> 00:54:42,677
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to get it on.

740
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:46,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the leaf blower goes off.

741
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyways, it's cute.

742
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:50,903
[SPEAKER_01]: My messenger, I wanted to give it to him tonight.

743
00:54:55,762 --> 00:54:57,783
[SPEAKER_15]: We're here for the squirrels and we're here for the rats.

744
00:55:00,443 --> 00:55:02,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Cassinetti.

745
00:55:03,444 --> 00:55:09,906
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Callahan to adjourn seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

746
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:12,107
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

747
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:13,247
