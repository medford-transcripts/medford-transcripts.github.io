1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,209
an executive session.

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:13,775
I'm happy to announce that by unanimous vote, we took a major step to pay equity for our Kids Corner and paraprofessionals.

3
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:21,678
So that was a 7-0 vote, and those contracts have been ratified, which is great news.

4
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:26,680
We also want to welcome back Domenico Bruno and Melanie Chavez.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,321
Yes, thank you for being here, our student reps.

6
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:37,993
We're gonna move on to the consent agenda, bills and payrolls, as well as regular school committee meeting minutes, September 19, 2022.

7
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,054
Motion to approve?

8
00:00:40,154 --> 00:00:40,895
Motion to approve.

9
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:42,416
Seconded by member Hayes.

10
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:43,216
All those in favor?

11
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:43,857
Aye.

12
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:44,918
All those opposed?

13
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:47,679
Consent agenda is approved.

14
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:49,661
There are no reports of subcommittees.

15
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:52,383
We have a number six report of the superintendent.

16
00:00:52,463 --> 00:00:55,525
Superintendent's updates and comments, Dr. Maurice Edwards.

17
00:00:58,953 --> 00:00:59,673
Thank you, Mayor.

18
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:00,734
Good evening.

19
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:14,442
First, I would like to acknowledge our fellow Floridians who have a long road ahead of them due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Ian.

20
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:27,209
And for the more than 100 plus people who have already passed away as a result of the hurricane, I would like us just to observe a moment of silence

21
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:30,622
but you could rise for a moment of silence.

22
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,170
Thank you.

23
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:48,954
Also, since we last met,

24
00:01:51,994 --> 00:02:06,138
At the high school, both on the vocational side, there is a beautiful memorial garden honoring many members of our staff who have passed away over the past several years.

25
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:16,121
And I wanna just thank member Hayes, former member Vanderkoed, Mayor Brianna for supporting that event.

26
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:34,604
Principal Fallon, who's here and Principal DeLava, who also with our CCSR students, CCSR leaders who coordinated the beautiful ceremony to honor the lost members of staff.

27
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:39,145
So I just wanna thank them for such a beautiful ceremony.

28
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:44,206
And when you're at the high school complex, when you go into the main entrance,

29
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:47,668
of the vocational side, you can see the beautiful garden.

30
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:56,816
Also on the west courtyard side of the high school, you can see the continuation of the garden on both sides of our campus.

31
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:01,950
So I wanna just share some updates and remarks.

32
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,452
First, we are in the month of October.

33
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:13,980
October is a symphony of permanence and change, said the author, Bonaro Overstreet.

34
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:25,389
The color of the leaves are changing and providing vibrant colors in the Middlesex Fells Woods, which abuts Medford High School, which beautifies our landscape.

35
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:43,508
I want to open with a very large congratulations to our Mustang Marching Band and our Color Guard on hosting the New England Scholastic Band Association competition last Saturday at Hormel.

36
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,462
12 school districts competed and the Mustang band took home second place.

37
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:56,644
Additionally, our color guard took home first place.

38
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,184
So we're very proud of them.

39
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:04,366
They will be continuing to compete in many more competitions this season.

40
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:05,706
Great job.

41
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:07,607
Keep up the great work Mustangs.

42
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:18,792
Last week, we also had 15 Italian students accompanied by Dr. Bobo, Coordinator of World Languages, Ms.

43
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:19,753
Canetta, Ms.

44
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:21,133
Shalafo, Ms.

45
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:25,515
Ogudari, and former World Language Director, Ms.

46
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:26,515
DiCarlo.

47
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:33,738
They attended Puccini's famous opera, La Boheme, at the Emerson Colonial Theater.

48
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:46,385
According to Dr. Bobol, our students studied this opera in class and later, as in the tradition of the world language department, we brought our students to witness the actual opera.

49
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:51,148
I hope this tradition will always continue at Medford High School.

50
00:04:53,524 --> 00:05:16,745
Also, our great community partner, Tufts University, not only held an incredible community day event yesterday with over 60 nonprofit tables that had information, free food and games, they have also informed us that their school of medicine hosts the Sherwood Clinic at Cambridge Health Alliance on Canal Street in Malden.

51
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,189
from Saturdays from 1 to 4.30.

52
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,491
No insurance is necessary.

53
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,494
An interpretation is available there.

54
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:35,984
Services include blood pressure and glucose screenings, nutritional counseling, medical management options, and school physicals.

55
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:41,569
So if you're out there and trying to get an appointment, please take advantage of that.

56
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:48,907
I want to remind the community that this Wednesday, October 5th, there will be no school.

57
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:57,230
as our Jewish students, staff, and neighbors celebrate Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement.

58
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:05,816
May I say to our Jewish friends, Gamar Fatima Tovah, which means, may you be sealed in the book of life.

59
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:20,126
I really appreciate the quote of the late Rabbi Jonathan Sachs, who once said, the most important lesson of the high holidays is that nothing, nothing is broken beyond repair.

60
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:24,612
It is never too late to change and to be better.

61
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:32,463
Next Wednesday, October 12th, Medford CPAC will be hosting

62
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,030
their meeting by Zoom.

63
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:45,435
On the agenda is to meet the administrators of the central administration and the special education department, as well as their general meeting.

64
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:50,818
So six to seven is their general meeting and meet the administrators starts at 7 p.m.

65
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:58,442
This coming weekend, as you know, we are now well into fall.

66
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:05,570
And so during this season, there are lots of fairs, fundraisers, social events, including the following.

67
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:14,979
October is breast cancer awareness month and the Mustang girls volleyball team will be hosting a pink out tournament.

68
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,528
to raise money for breast cancer research the weekend of October 22nd and 23rd.

69
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:26,214
The team is selling t-shirts ahead of the tournament at a cost of $20.

70
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:33,864
Track down a volleyball team member to grab a t-shirt to support this important cause.

71
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:51,376
For those of you who may have Columbus Day or Indigenous Peoples Day off, please consider coming out to support the Medford Family Network at the 11th Annual MFN Golf Tournament hosted by Yokey Restaurant.

72
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:56,738
The tournament is held at Sagamore Springs Golf Club in Linfield.

73
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,920
The cost is $150 per person.

74
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,682
You can sign up on the Yokey website at yokeyrestaurant.com.

75
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,561
The MFN are also actively seeking donations for prizes for the raffle.

76
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:15,947
For further information, please reach out to Ms.

77
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:16,789
Marie Cassidy.

78
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:28,050
Saturday, October 15th, from 12 to three, brings the return of the Harvest Your Energy Fair behind the McGlynn School.

79
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:33,013
And on Sunday, October 16th, from 11 a.m.

80
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:39,016
to 4 p.m., the Brooks PTO will be hosting the annual Fall Fest.

81
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,337
It's a fun time for all.

82
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:47,261
I strongly encourage families to come out to both events on Saturday and Sunday.

83
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:50,385
It'll be lots of fun, lots of prizes.

84
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:57,536
Also, again, next Monday, there will be no school.

85
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:02,684
It's October 10th for Indigenous Peoples Day, Columbus Day.

86
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,147
October is also Italian American Heritage Month.

87
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:24,122
It is celebrated every year to honor and recognize the centuries of achievements, successes, and valuable contributions of Italian immigrants and Italian Americans.

88
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:37,631
The first Italian American Heritage Month was celebrated in 1989 by a special proclamation of both Congress and President George H.W.

89
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:37,992
Bush.

90
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:43,855
Over 5 million Italians immigrated to the United States between 1820 and 2000.

91
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:55,723
Italians are the fifth largest ethnic group in our nation, and one of the many nationalities that have made Medford home.

92
00:09:56,764 --> 00:10:06,932
To our Italian-American friends, and forgive me if I botch it a little bit, Feliz Mese del Eredita Italo-Americana.

93
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:10,475
Happy Italian-American Heritage Month.

94
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:12,857
And I close with a poem.

95
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,640
It says, it's called Hello, October.

96
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:27,487
Oh, one of the best things you can do for yourself is taking time to learn and grow.

97
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:39,070
Once you give yourself patience, you become your best friend and the empathy, self-kindness and resilience are what you need to grow.

98
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,891
Thank you and have a good evening.

99
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:43,672
Thank you.

100
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:45,492
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

101
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,193
Number two, we have report on chapter 74.

102
00:10:49,548 --> 00:11:05,400
Vocational Programming at Medford High School in the 2022-2023 school year, Dr. Peter J. Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment and Innovation, and Mr. Chad Fallon, Principal Director of Medford Vocational Technical High School Programs.

103
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:08,222
Welcome.

104
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:20,690
Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee for this opportunity to present the annual presentation on Chapter 74 programming.

105
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:39,218
As Mr. Fallon will detail in his presentation, the vocational school is seeing great expanses and expansion within its programs and is doing a really great job supporting our students with these hands-on, real-world learning applications.

106
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,239
Mr. Fallon.

107
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,039
Thank you.

108
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:42,080
Good evening.

109
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,980
Nice to see everybody.

110
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:46,826
I'm gonna give you guys an update on what we've been up to over the past year.

111
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:54,389
Actually, when I was looking at my presentation from last time, I'm not sure that we did this last year because of, I'm not sure I couldn't find it.

112
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:55,249
I found it two years ago.

113
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:56,309
It was all about remote learning.

114
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,290
I was happy to kind of turn the page on that.

115
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,651
I wanna introduce some new staff this year that we hired.

116
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:06,613
First off, his name is Andrew Theobald, and he's in the picture to the right, actually.

117
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:08,814
He is our new automotive technology instructor.

118
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,379
And then we also hired a metal fabrication instructor, Mr. Curtis Jackson, who's on the left.

119
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:20,085
When I went into the space to take pictures of the teachers, the students were more than happy to jump into the picture with them.

120
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,567
So I just let it happen.

121
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:26,213
So that's some of the automotive and some of the metal fab students, two great additions to our team.

122
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:32,063
We have been doing some renovations.

123
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:37,367
You know, no report is usually complete on my end in case I haven't broken down some walls.

124
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,408
So I'm gonna fill you in on what we've done.

125
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:49,335
Cosmetology, as you know, the salon opened a year ago, but we finally moved the grade nine and 10 classroom up to the room next to the salon, which actually already had glass windows installed.

126
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:52,257
So now the freshmen and sophomores can look into the salon.

127
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:54,458
The two teachers are together now.

128
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:05,795
We renovated our Make Way for Kids and our early childhood education program, the Make Way for Kids program, which is a nursery school for little tykes on three days a week in the morning.

129
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:11,939
We moved them from the cosmetology space downstairs to a ground level floor room.

130
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,764
And that's a picture that you see there that's completely redone with new carpet walls, window treatments, and some plumbing.

131
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:21,606
And you can go to the next slide.

132
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:22,987
The electrical department,

133
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,111
As you know, there's booths that the students work in.

134
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:29,912
They were splintered and old, so we needed to replace all the booths.

135
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:32,093
So that was a project that the carpentry students took on.

136
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:37,114
They removed all the booths on the left side of the shop and replaced them with brand new booths for the students to work in.

137
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:41,996
The room on the right, on the top, is just a picture of the cosmetology-related room.

138
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:45,837
The teacher did an incredible job getting it to where it is now.

139
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:50,019
You can't really see it, but off in the back are the windows that look into the salon.

140
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,803
And then the bottom right is a picture of graphic design.

141
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:55,264
It was completed last spring.

142
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:58,187
And these are two rooms that have been combined.

143
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:06,733
That's the former cosmetology space, which is now custom desks that were built by the carpentry students and new computers in that space.

144
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:13,138
The Mustang Mall also moved to a new location on our side of the building.

145
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:14,980
And that's where King Falls is.

146
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,414
Quick report on the Skills Capital Grant.

147
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:27,157
If you remember correctly, the Skills Capital Grant is awarded to vocational technical schools and this was our third time receiving it.

148
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:36,362
This time we had just under $365,000 and this was directly funded for the Construction Craft Laborers Program.

149
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:41,660
as well as our other construction trade programs, electrical, carpentry, and metal fabrication.

150
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:48,284
That's just one picture on the left of many pieces of equipment that we got.

151
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:51,406
One of my students here to the right who's in the program could tell you more.

152
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:53,747
We completely

153
00:14:56,491 --> 00:15:01,034
outfitted the shop with the type of materials that students would need out in the workforce.

154
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:12,082
So we have that, we have a couple pickup trucks, we have a lowboy dump trailer, we have equipment inside that won't even leave the shop, and then we have other stuff that we're using on job sites.

155
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:14,003
So we're really happy about that.

156
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:30,289
And this was, I just have to do a special thank you to the teachers in that program, Mr. Danny Kelly, Mr. Ralph Taleva, Mr. Larry Brown, and of course to my amazing administrative assistant Gina Citrano, who kind of pulled it all together for us on the budget end.

157
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:31,590
So thanks to that team.

158
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,396
We also were recently awarded a Mass Life Sciences grant that we applied for.

159
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,640
just under $120,000.

160
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,745
$20,000 will be put towards professional development and the remaining is for supplies and materials for our biotechnology program.

161
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:57,431
Can't really see it, but what you can see on the left is kind of a

162
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:04,420
over the last six or seven years, the enrollment shift in our career and technical education pathway.

163
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,601
So you can see it's steadily rising up.

164
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:12,545
Nearly 45% of the students in the high school complex right now are on a CTE pathway.

165
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:15,547
On the right, that figure shows you grade nine.

166
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:21,371
So blue would be CTE grade nine, and the orange is the overall enrollment.

167
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:23,753
So this year, for example, it's about

168
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:29,931
60-something percent of the freshmen right now at the high school are choosing CTE Exploratory.

169
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:41,080
If we look at last year, I think there was, I think we had about 250 students go through Exploratory and about 160 of them stayed on as sophomores.

170
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,363
So that kind of gives you an idea, you know, the blue is creeping up.

171
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:48,105
So that last column on the right shows that there's

172
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:54,746
know, essentially any student who wants to participate in CTE Exploratory is able to do so at night school.

173
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,433
We continue to work with our partners in our workforce development initiative.

174
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,995
We have cooperative education that's going strong.

175
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:09,595
We have a new

176
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:15,620
Mr. Grinley, who retired the second time from us just in the spring.

177
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:27,865
So now between myself and Alice Beth Fitzpatrick, our assistant director, we're working with a teacher who's just recently been licensed for co-op in the state of Massachusetts, Ms.

178
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:33,528
Holly Farnham-Cassebon, and she is going to be our co-op coordinator as a stipend position.

179
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:42,093
Those, that kind of word out there is just many of the partners that we work with now and the many of the jobs that our students are out on.

180
00:17:42,113 --> 00:17:47,857
So we just wanted to make sure that those are front and center because they support us just as much as we support them.

181
00:17:51,613 --> 00:18:00,016
For our professional development this year, our focus has been built around a lot of the work we've done with the REVIS training in support of five core actions.

182
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:10,020
We started the year by saying content is important, but we're really looking to, when we're in the classrooms, we're gonna be looking for how you're building those positive relationships with students.

183
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,442
So that was an agreed upon look for that we decided as administrators, what we're gonna look for when we go into classrooms.

184
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:18,270
also spent a lot of time on building connections.

185
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:28,118
At the beginning of the year, we sent these kind of stress ball type building blocks to the whole school in an effort to remind people that we are building connections for both sides.

186
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,981
So kind of that being our theme,

187
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:44,336
building the positive relationships with students, which ties right into social-emotional learning, and then some curriculum work, because a lot of the standards for the Mass Vocational Frameworks have changed or been revised.

188
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:53,783
So we're going to be spending this year really aligning our curriculum, making sure teachers have a clear understanding of what they're teaching and students know why they're learning it.

189
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:59,467
Questions?

190
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,196
Yes, yes, I want to thank you for the report.

191
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:06,798
It was great.

192
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,362
And last year I got to

193
00:19:09,154 --> 00:19:12,557
go to the live open house and see some of the updated programs.

194
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:13,597
They look fantastic.

195
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:20,462
So I just wanted to know if you would briefly be able to describe what the mass core framework is.

196
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:25,045
I know I got it described in an email and I just thought it was very interesting.

197
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:27,968
And if you were able to share it, if you could do that.

198
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:29,569
So mass core?

199
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:30,489
Yes.

200
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,071
Well, mass core is the state.

201
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:39,069
We don't, I mean, math core doesn't really fit into my piece of the puzzle.

202
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:40,269
You mean the frameworks that we use?

203
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:41,170
The frameworks, yes.

204
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:41,690
Yeah, sorry.

205
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:49,072
So just like an English or math curriculum, there are frameworks for every vocational technical program that's offered.

206
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:52,953
A lot of them have been revised and it takes years to be done.

207
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:54,754
So now like the automotive curriculum is new.

208
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:59,235
So we're gonna need to figure out how that looks when we're using it in theory.

209
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:05,356
So for our frameworks, oftentimes it's a lot of documentation.

210
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:10,537
There's many different standards within each program's frameworks, one being embedded academics.

211
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:14,998
So with every program we have, there's a crossover of literacy and numeracy skills.

212
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:17,578
So we need to make sure the teachers are comfortable doing that.

213
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,779
There's a safety component and there's a technical content, which everyone has.

214
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:28,020
And that's basically the part of the frameworks that tells the teacher what is it that should be taught by the time these students leave high school.

215
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:30,112
Thank you.

216
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:36,197
And do you know when the fall advisory meeting is going to be?

217
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:39,400
Like, is there going to be, like, in the fall advisory meeting?

218
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,361
Yes, November 8th.

219
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:41,602
You'll all be getting a save the date.

220
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:42,583
Oh, great.

221
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:43,564
Okay, thank you.

222
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,466
And one last thing.

223
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:49,109
When my son was at the vocational as a student,

224
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:55,458
Um, there was some limitations with the scheduling, um, with extracurriculars in world language.

225
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:06,381
And I was just wondering, um, if, if that's going to be something that might be worked on into the schedules where, um, those opportunities might be more available for the students, for the CTE students.

226
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,742
If we can get a new master schedule, that's the goal.

227
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:09,382
Right.

228
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:10,462
And that's what I know.

229
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:19,144
I had received some information in an email, but I just wanted to kind of just put that out there that that's something that I believe the district, the administration's working on to try and

230
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:21,668
get the schedule and get that in there.

231
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:26,290
Yeah, we've really done all the band-aiding we can do at this point.

232
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,991
So yes, we are ready for any schedule.

233
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:30,372
Thank you.

234
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:31,793
Thank you.

235
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:33,694
Really appreciate it.

236
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:35,675
Member McLaughlin and Member McStone.

237
00:21:39,017 --> 00:21:40,758
I just wanted to say thank you for the rapport.

238
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:48,061
And it was really good seeing everyone at curriculum night the other night and the great turnout and the increased attendance and interest in our vocational school.

239
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:49,562
So I know that you guys have all done that.

240
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:51,806
or collectively, it looks great over there.

241
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:53,527
I hope people are taking a tour around.

242
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:56,888
I'm just excited by the opportunities for our students.

243
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:57,628
So thank you.

244
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:58,408
Thank you.

245
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:02,629
Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

246
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,550
I was just wondering, I saw, I don't know if you want to go two slides back.

247
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:13,932
So last year there was 199 ninth graders who did CTE, right?

248
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:16,973
It jumped to 269 this current year for ninth graders.

249
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:19,808
I think last year was more than one, but was it, did it say 199?

250
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:21,508
But okay.

251
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:26,270
How many 10th graders then chose to stay in the vocational school?

252
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:26,270
160.

253
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,510
Wow.

254
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,991
So that's a very large percentage.

255
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:30,812
Our largest ever.

256
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:39,575
It was like, it was one of those moments that we were like excited, but also frightened because it was like, okay, we get, we need to make sure we have

257
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:49,505
So 160 from say 200, I don't know who has the slides, but so then do you expect, so this current ninth grade class is 269.

258
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:57,852
Do you think you'll get 200 students then choosing to the vocational school in 10th grade?

259
00:22:58,492 --> 00:23:01,835
If we keep trending the way we are, then the data would say yes.

260
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:06,859
So then would that lead you to, are you considering adding shops?

261
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:09,549
Yes and no.

262
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:12,752
We have a constraint right now, and that's the building space.

263
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:13,993
There's no room.

264
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:21,860
Yes, this program we'd love to offer, but we're not at the point yet that we don't have enough seats in our current programs for our students.

265
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:30,468
With the increase in enrollment, and actually everything lands really nicely because we still have seats in two or three different programs.

266
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:32,831
But absolutely, in the future.

267
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:39,983
And then do we have any students in Medford who are going to other vocational schools because they're looking for a shop we don't offer?

268
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:40,303
Yes.

269
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:46,067
One to Minute Man for plumbing and one to Minute Man for horticulture, but she's a junior.

270
00:23:46,387 --> 00:23:48,349
So it's a two-year commitment for us.

271
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:48,929
Okay.

272
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,291
So it's not like there's something out there that people are looking for at another shop?

273
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:52,892
No, just plumbing.

274
00:23:52,912 --> 00:24:00,637
Plumbing would be the next one I'd open because that's, and you know that when a parent comes to me and expresses their concern, I'm like, well, you should go to Minute Man 100% because they have a program.

275
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:01,278
So yeah.

276
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:02,905
All right, that's great.

277
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:07,108
We had a few that went to Essex, but that person graduated and we had another one from an event.

278
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:08,809
We usually average about one a year.

279
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:09,549
Okay.

280
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:10,570
All right.

281
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,571
Thank you very much.

282
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,474
Thank you, Principal Fallon and Dr. Cushing.

283
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:23,978
I just want to also add that the cosmetology renovations, as has been mentioned previously, but with such a generous donation,

284
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:29,230
Medford alumni Charles Hoth named it in honor of his mother Priscilla Hoth.

285
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:41,496
And so it's just a really great member of the community coming back and putting their wallet in full support of our students and really developing an amazing space for them to work.

286
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:43,357
Thank you.

287
00:24:43,637 --> 00:24:44,057
Thank you.

288
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:44,738
Thank you.

289
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:45,678
Thank you.

290
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,340
We have

291
00:24:50,396 --> 00:24:52,997
Our third report, Health Education Curriculum Review.

292
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:58,400
Dr. Peter J. Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment and Innovation, and Ms.

293
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:02,923
Rachel Perry, Director of Physical and Health Education.

294
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:03,883
Welcome.

295
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:08,586
Just give me one second to pull up the presentation.

296
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:24,564
All right, once again, good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

297
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:39,590
I'm happy to stand before you tonight with Rachel Perry to discuss the health education curriculum review process and the team that will be created to conduct this year long review of this.

298
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:46,753
Rachel brought this to me a few weeks ago and upon review really seemed like the way that we should be going.

299
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:50,335
So I'm gonna turn over to Rachel now for some of our slides.

300
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:53,236
Good evening, everyone.

301
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:54,216
Thank you for having us.

302
00:25:55,077 --> 00:25:59,500
So to start, what I'm going to talk a little bit about is the history of health education in Medford.

303
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:09,066
Pre-2013, we were using the second step curriculum at the elementary level and the body shop curriculums at the secondary level.

304
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:17,652
Michigan model skills-based health curriculum was piloted and chosen to be used at both levels to replace those out-of-date curriculums.

305
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:19,213
In 2013-2014 school year,

306
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:28,990
Michigan model was started at the high school level, and in 14-15, we started that at the middle school level.

307
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:44,856
I started the position in the 2015-2016 school year, and we looked at the Michigan model SEL units and piloted that in 2015 and 16, and then we adopted that in the 2016-17 year for the elementary schools.

308
00:26:49,375 --> 00:27:13,406
At that point, what I did with my staff is we put together our curriculum, we aligned it to the state and national standards, looking at the state standards, those are from 1999, those were very old, so we really started to look more at the national standards and we aligned what we were doing at that time to the national standards and we found that there was a gap in the sexual health.

309
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:14,331
piece.

310
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:24,196
We added that to the high school curriculum in 2017 and 2018, using an abstinence-based sexual health curriculum.

311
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:31,821
And in 2021-22, it was added to the middle school curriculum.

312
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,242
So those are the recent updates.

313
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:43,956
What we're looking to do now, looking at, we've been using the Michigan model starting a little bit around 2013, right after that.

314
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:48,817
It's almost been 10 years, so it's time to really take a look at what we're doing and evaluate that.

315
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:55,679
In order to do that, we're taking a look at the HECAT, which is the Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool.

316
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:05,622
And this is an assessment tool developed by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in partnership with health education experts from state and local education agencies.

317
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:09,610
schools, colleges, and universities, and national organizations.

318
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:21,359
The purpose is to provide state, regional, and local education agencies with a common set of tools to assist with the selection of development of health education curricula.

319
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:28,344
And if you look at the bottom of that slide, it goes over exactly what topics we'll be evaluating.

320
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:51,539
The HECAT draws upon synthesis of research and criteria based upon findings from the Center of Disease Control's guidelines for school health programs, which identifies common characteristics of effective programs in priority health topic areas, the national education, health education standards, guidance from the U.S.

321
00:28:51,559 --> 00:29:00,682
Department of Education Office of Safe and Healthy Schools, expertise of CDC health and behavioral scientists and health education specialists,

322
00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:05,847
and expertise of health education researchers and practitioners from the field.

323
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:10,349
Part of the HECAT process steps.

324
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:15,671
The first one is looking at the decision tree recommendations.

325
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:19,913
You don't have that before you, but I've already evaluated that.

326
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:23,695
And we already have a scope and sequence in place.

327
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:25,736
We already have a curriculum.

328
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:31,808
The next step it asks is if the curriculum is aligned with the HECAT and it is not.

329
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:38,813
So at that point, what we would need to do is perform an analysis using the HECAT of our current curriculum.

330
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:47,739
From there, next we would identify a health education curriculum coordinator, which I believe we already have.

331
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:48,379
That would be me.

332
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:55,724
And from there we form a health education curriculum review team and we obtain

333
00:29:56,425 --> 00:30:01,707
put together our curriculum and our assessments, and orient the members of the team.

334
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:06,429
We'll evaluate what we're doing, looking at our curriculum and all of our assessments.

335
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:10,951
We do a review, and then we develop a timeline.

336
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:23,236
After the curriculum analysis is complete, we convene a meeting and review and discuss the completed analysis, reviewing scores, and we rank the curricula.

337
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:33,141
From there, we make curriculum recommendations and we assign curriculum revisions and supplementations and improvements to a writing team.

338
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:37,464
From there, we make decisions on where we're gonna go with that.

339
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:51,435
Looking at our timeline that we've put together, we'd like to use October this month to create that committee, have the committee meet from November, 2022 through May of 2023,

340
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:59,173
and then complete our evaluation, submit recommendations by June of 2023.

341
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:07,226
And then implementation of the recommendations, it would be implemented when we were approved and budgeted.

342
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:17,094
So before you is a table of people who might serve on the PCAP review process.

343
00:31:17,935 --> 00:31:23,599
So school and district curriculum specialists, school or district administrator, school board members.

344
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,785
So at the next meeting, hopefully this board would be able to recommend a member who would be willing to serve.

345
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:34,669
Elementary teacher, middle school teacher, high school teacher.

346
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:37,991
And I don't have to read them all to you, you can read them.

347
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:48,890
It's a comprehensive committee to really take an in-depth look at our health curriculum and make recommendations based upon the research and the science.

348
00:31:49,468 --> 00:31:59,713
that is out there now and hopefully based on the Massachusetts curriculum standards, which here's a timeline from a DESE presentation.

349
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:05,456
This is a source from a June 2019 Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.

350
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:14,081
The expectation was that the draft results would have been out sometime in winter 2019, winter 2020.

351
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:19,387
for a variety of potential reasons.

352
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:27,889
Those have yet to be released and a board vote of the board of elementary and secondary education has not taken place.

353
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:38,291
I received a phone call from the department of elementary and secondary education today saying that they're still trying to schedule these standards to be reviewed.

354
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:45,432
But given that we're now 23 years on, and if I'm correct, these are the last major curriculum standards

355
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:53,309
that have not been revised and implemented in the cadre of curriculum frameworks.

356
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,552
These are the next ones to become hopefully reviewed and implemented.

357
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:12,596
This committee will have this work done within the school year, and we'll look to create a very well-versed and broad ranging committee to help support this work.

358
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:18,111
And we will take any questions or comments you may have.

359
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:22,094
Member McLaughlin, Member Graham, Member Kratz.

360
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:23,235
Thank you.

361
00:33:25,057 --> 00:33:26,138
Thank you for the presentation.

362
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:27,919
It's definitely an ambitious schedule.

363
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:29,660
It looks like you guys are going to be really busy.

364
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:43,552
I did have a couple of questions about how the PCAT review team will be selected, how we'll be addressing diversity and equity for the selection of the team, and also

365
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:48,710
Specifically, I don't see a family representative on there, and I just wanted to make that recommendation.

366
00:33:48,770 --> 00:34:02,795
And I also would make a recommendation for a special education representative and a EL representative, especially as we're thinking about how items translate, how words have varying meanings among different cultures.

367
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:12,679
And I would especially think about if we could differentiate instruction and universal design for learning for students with disabilities, as you can imagine, especially around

368
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:16,128
sex education, puberty, that sort of stuff.

369
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:28,755
I certainly have resources that I can share with you around some other curriculums that we've experienced that have been great, but definitely want us to be proactive as we're thinking about how we're differentiating that information for all of our students.

370
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:29,595
Thank you.

371
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:35,799
Member Graham.

372
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:38,332
Thank you.

373
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:40,873
I'm really excited to see this.

374
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:42,234
I know we've talked about this a couple times.

375
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:44,655
A couple of questions I had.

376
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:52,818
If somebody would like to participate on the curriculum review team, who do they reach out to?

377
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,081
And how will the community that may not be watching the school committee meeting know to engage in this?

378
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:09,313
We're going to put together a wide range of communication and request people to submit their qualifications to be part of the committee.

379
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:10,794
OK.

380
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:23,800
And does the HECAT require that the sexual health evaluation be evidence-based?

381
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:35,529
In the materials that I have reviewed, and I'll also let Rachel speak to this, there's an overall comprehensive look at having them be evidence-based.

382
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:42,074
And that comes up frequently in the documents that I've reviewed.

383
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:45,977
And like you know, printed out, the HECAT is about this thick.

384
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:50,781
It is extraordinarily comprehensive, so to say that we've reviewed all of it.

385
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:59,586
would be a misnomer, but they do have several supporting documents that help to break it down, but I'll let Rachel add anything else.

386
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:05,271
So the HECAT is based on the national standards, which is evidence-based and comprehensive.

387
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:18,921
And the other question I had looking at the timeline, just thinking about the potential budget implications, if you all aren't formulating your responses or your recommendations,

388
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:31,030
until the June timeframe, it sounds like there just may be a mismatch in terms of what we may or may not need from a budget standpoint.

389
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:37,175
And I didn't know if you took that into consideration when you put the timeline together or if you could.

390
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:48,083
And a couple of the things that I think about really specifically are from an implementation perspective, the middle school students who don't get health because they go to band.

391
00:36:49,605 --> 00:37:00,716
you know, the need for health teach credentialed health teachers that we may or may not have in the district at all levels and how that fits into our staffing and our scheduling.

392
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:11,808
And I just feel like there could be like a whole slew of implications from a budget perspective that we would want to be able to prioritize as quickly as possible, because I think this is long overdue.

393
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:18,798
if we never show those crazy videos to the fifth graders, again, from Proctor and Gamble, it will be too soon for me.

394
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:24,720
So I just wanna make sure that there's nothing at the end of this process that sort of delays our ability to implement.

395
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,220
Because I do think, at least for me, this is a huge priority for the district.

396
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:34,662
And it is, as you mentioned, like the last man standing around curriculum.

397
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:40,303
And I think we may not be willing to wait for the legislature, for DESE,

398
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:45,877
for the legislature to step in and say, this has to be a priority for districts.

399
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:50,561
So I think our kids need this information and this education.

400
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:55,966
And I wanna make sure that whatever we can do to clear the path, that we're doing it proactively for you.

401
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:04,554
Yes, I think that as we're going through this process, I kind of already know where the gaps are.

402
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:07,577
I think as we're going through the process, I'll be able to report back

403
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,623
before budget to say, this is what we might be needing.

404
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:14,205
So we can kind of give you some kind of indication as to where we're at.

405
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:15,847
Awesome.

406
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:16,207
Thank you.

407
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,230
Member Kretz?

408
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:20,712
Yes.

409
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:21,873
Thank you for the presentation.

410
00:38:21,953 --> 00:38:24,055
And I had a similar question that Ms.

411
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:27,298
Graham had, was how do interested community members

412
00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:30,255
you know, find out about opportunities and you've already answered it.

413
00:38:30,336 --> 00:38:30,936
So I'm all set.

414
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:33,197
It was easy.

415
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:33,597
Thank you.

416
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:34,278
Yes.

417
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:35,058
Member McLaughlin.

418
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,059
Just what's the time commitment.

419
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:40,601
I know it said it's two times a month that you guys plan on meeting.

420
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:41,962
How long are those meetings going to be?

421
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:53,569
I would say that just given they're probably going to be about two hours long each, and then there's going to be an expectation for community members and members of this committee to do research to work in between.

422
00:38:54,818 --> 00:39:03,165
As well There's no way that we would be able to conduct this meeting this body of work within just two hours Within four hours a month.

423
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:22,460
I should say so myself and Rachel will also be doing a considerable amount of work to help support the committee, but The reality is is that I would say you're looking at four hours plus whatever time individuals need on their own to Do the pieces and the tasks that are necessary?

424
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:32,636
And just lastly, I'm wondering if there's any sort of pediatrician or any role like that that you guys have considered for?

425
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:39,603
I think that might fall under community health care providers.

426
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:41,484
I just wanted to make sure that I got the terminology.

427
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:43,166
Yeah.

428
00:39:44,127 --> 00:39:44,587
OK, great.

429
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:44,807
Thank you.

430
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:47,670
We have our student rep, Domenico, who has a question.

431
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:53,665
Hi, so as a vocational student, my schedule was limited enough that I can't have a health class.

432
00:39:54,125 --> 00:40:05,190
Are there any, are you guys gonna look into options for possibly revamping the online program or offering education to students who can't really fit into their schedules?

433
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:17,795
I think after the HECAT, after we do the evaluation, we also do need to take a look at scheduling and maybe look at an online option for students that are in that same position.

434
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:34,485
Also, it's a significant goal of the high school leadership and district leadership to take a comprehensive outside look at our schedule and to see the ways that we can really improve and move our high school schedule forward.

435
00:40:34,885 --> 00:40:45,947
So that what I need to be clear about this, while everybody can't have everything, we need to do a better job at making sure that those priority elements are there.

436
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:50,978
Unfortunately, that in high school scheduling, there are difficult choices that may have to be made.

437
00:40:51,679 --> 00:41:06,103
I would say that health should not be falling into the category of difficult choice, but we need a comprehensive examination of our high school schedule and some barriers to move out of the way to make sure that that can happen.

438
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:12,345
And to piggyback on that, it was that I think member Graham announced it as well.

439
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,880
If you have banned in the middle school, you can't take health.

440
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:31,669
So is there any option for parents to use a curriculum at home or for students in high school or at the Boak to take any sort of health education or learn anything about what would be taught in health during the day?

441
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:41,274
So like I said, I think once we evaluate this, we can come up with an online program that does meet all the standards, and we can provide that as well if our

442
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:43,522
off schedule can't meet those needs.

443
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,583
But nothing is offered can be off right now.

444
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:51,165
Thank you.

445
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:52,186
Resident.

446
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:56,628
I just name an address for the record, please.

447
00:41:57,388 --> 00:41:58,949
I'm sorry, name address for the record.

448
00:41:59,089 --> 00:41:59,509
Oh, sure.

449
00:41:59,689 --> 00:42:02,370
I'm Katie Adamak, and I live at 14 Walcott Street.

450
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:10,618
I have a son in the sixth grade at the Angers Middle School, and I'm also a public health researcher.

451
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:16,483
I study sexual reproductive health, and sexuality education is actually my career.

452
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:23,536
So this is something that's kind of near and dear to my heart, and I'm really, really excited that you guys are taking a look at this.

453
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:29,099
And I've been underwhelmed by what I've heard about the sexuality education in Medford schools.

454
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,161
I will say, I can't really speak to, like, larger health education as it is.

455
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:38,444
I am really excited to hear that you guys are

456
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,860
assessing curricula using the eCAT.

457
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,741
I think the eCAT is an important tool.

458
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:50,684
However, the curricula that you're assessing and selecting those curricula, I think in a lot of ways is more important.

459
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:56,466
So you can run any curricula through the eCAT to see if it's an effective curricula.

460
00:42:57,947 --> 00:42:58,847
But, you know, there's

461
00:43:01,523 --> 00:43:07,929
and things in all these different curricula, like choosing an abstinence-based curricula definitely has a very certain message for the community.

462
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:14,776
I definitely, as a researcher who's an expert in this field, very much do not recommend using an abstinence-based curricula.

463
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:16,157
You should be using a comprehensive

464
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:26,912
Our students deserve to learn about all sorts of different types of sexuality, things like healthy relationships, consent, birth control, all of that stuff.

465
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:33,534
Abstinence is one piece of it, and it is an important piece of it, but it's very important to learn about these other things.

466
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:39,792
So in terms of selecting sex ed curricula, I just wanted to let you know about several tools that are out there.

467
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:42,894
So there's the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Evidence Review.

468
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:49,299
I'm a reviewer on that project through HHS, Department of Health and Human Services.

469
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:56,665
And it's a rigorous methodology that we go through to select the programs that are actually listed on that list.

470
00:43:56,805 --> 00:43:59,668
It's been on hiatus for five years through the previous

471
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:05,312
presidential administration, they put it on hiatus, but this is the first year that the review is back.

472
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:14,337
And so in March, we'll have a big release of new programs, but already there's 30 programs on the current list that you can select from.

473
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:15,818
It's not a perfect list.

474
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:19,260
I'll say there are abstinence programs on that list.

475
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,722
So not everything on there is necessarily medically accurate.

476
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:28,284
It does have evidence of effectiveness for certain sexual behavior outcomes.

477
00:44:28,724 --> 00:44:30,085
I don't want to get into like all the details,

478
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:39,426
But I would love it if someone in Medford, I'm happy to help, would go through that list and help select curricula off of that.

479
00:44:40,186 --> 00:44:44,029
I don't know if you guys already have a curriculum in mind for sexuality education.

480
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,311
That's one thing I was wondering.

481
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:58,859
And also running, the HECAT's great, but for sex ed specifically, there's National Sexuality Education Standards, and they have their own assessment tool that I think is really important.

482
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,901
especially if you guys only do this once every 30 years.

483
00:45:03,102 --> 00:45:05,242
It might be worth the time.

484
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
I realize time is limited.

485
00:45:07,803 --> 00:45:08,904
But it is very concerning.

486
00:45:08,944 --> 00:45:15,407
Massachusetts is one state that has no mandate for medically accurate sex ed, which is very, very concerning.

487
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:19,488
Even though there are state health standards, sex ed, that is not a mandate.

488
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,690
So you could really teach anything at Medford about sex to kids.

489
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,151
So I hope we can be better than that and ensure that

490
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:32,315
what we are teaching our kids is medically accurate, is evidence-based with strong rigorous evidence behind it.

491
00:45:32,776 --> 00:45:36,821
People throw around the term evidence-based a lot, and a lot of curricula do as well.

492
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,824
And sometimes that evidence is very, very thin.

493
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:42,469
So I would ask that you like look through an evidence review.

494
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,871
Blueprints is another one as well.

495
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:46,039
But anyway, that's my two cents.

496
00:45:46,939 --> 00:45:47,240
Thank you.

497
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,641
Do you happen to have four hours?

498
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:50,162
Yeah.

499
00:45:50,262 --> 00:45:51,283
So thank you so much.

500
00:45:51,363 --> 00:45:54,146
And yeah, if you have any questions, Jenny knows how to get ahold of me, so share.

501
00:45:54,206 --> 00:45:57,789
Do you have four hours a month you could give us for a committee we're forming?

502
00:45:58,009 --> 00:45:58,670
Potentially.

503
00:45:58,910 --> 00:45:59,511
OK.

504
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:02,533
Thank you so much.

505
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:05,645
I want to thank Katie for coming up and speaking.

506
00:46:05,865 --> 00:46:17,149
It just, I think, as we move forward with the formation of this committee, we're going to be looking for members of the community who are going to be able to help push us and support us to bring the absolute best to the Metro students.

507
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:28,533
I do also want to, I failed to mention, this connects to our strategic plan, the very first initiative to make sure that we're conducting comprehensive curriculum reviews of our curriculum.

508
00:46:28,733 --> 00:46:32,675
So just wanted to make sure that that's known as it's connected to our strategic plan.

509
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:34,462
Thank you very much.

510
00:46:35,403 --> 00:46:35,784
Good news.

511
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:36,564
Thank you.

512
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:37,365
Thank you.

513
00:46:38,886 --> 00:46:47,813
Next, we have number four review of summer 2022 professional development and leadership training programs attended by the superintendent, Dr. Maurice Edward.

514
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:53,318
Thank you.

515
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:58,022
So this past summer, I had the opportunity to

516
00:46:58,766 --> 00:47:16,798
participate in different professional development sessions, both with MASS, Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, and with Leading Now, an additional professional development organization.

517
00:47:17,258 --> 00:47:28,025
But tonight, I just wanna take this opportunity to share with the committee what it is that I'm doing thus far, and the work that I will continue to be working on over the course of this year.

518
00:47:34,204 --> 00:47:49,435
So for the superintendent's professional development, my professional development is grounded on the premise that we want to, my goal is to promote district-wide coherence.

519
00:47:50,716 --> 00:47:53,939
Coherence is very, very important.

520
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:59,883
It can be defined as a systematic or logical connection or consistency.

521
00:48:00,908 --> 00:48:06,072
and B, the integration of diverse elements, relationships, or values.

522
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:20,404
So I do believe that through promoting coherence on a district-wide basis, all stakeholders will have similar experiences across the district, and it doesn't matter which homeschool is your base.

523
00:48:25,288 --> 00:48:29,191
So the professional development that I'll be participating in

524
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:32,294
is also connected to my core values.

525
00:48:33,815 --> 00:48:42,038
When I came to Medford, I talked about ACE, achievement for all, collaboration for all, and equity for all.

526
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,802
Achievement for all, believing that all students can learn and having high standards for all of our students.

527
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:54,924
Collaboration, I truly believe in the power of the team.

528
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:58,706
I believe in empowering colleagues who are leading the work,

529
00:48:59,721 --> 00:49:02,203
The collective is greater than the individual.

530
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:04,584
It is not one person who can do the job.

531
00:49:05,144 --> 00:49:06,565
It's a team that does the job.

532
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:19,093
So I believe in leveraging the strength of the entire team to work toward our strengths so that we can deliver the best quality service to the district and to our students.

533
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:21,935
E, equity for all.

534
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:28,039
We are stronger because of our differences and we value all learners.

535
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:49,498
In addition to being connected to my personal core values, professional core values, the professional development that I'm participating in is also directly connected to the goals that I presented to the committee at our last session.

536
00:49:50,618 --> 00:49:58,544
And I am zoning in specifically under the category umbrella of our district improvement goal.

537
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:07,443
And so our district improvement goal talks about creating a culture that values consistent communication.

538
00:50:08,524 --> 00:50:13,386
And we can move forward, bullet number three, which is consistent communication.

539
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:14,927
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

540
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,449
Creating a culture that values consistent communication.

541
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:25,175
This is a key action that was listed in the goals that were approved by this committee at our last session.

542
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:39,550
And again, consistent communication to families across all schools and student services, such as, but not limited to athletics, counseling, career services, and student governance.

543
00:50:43,257 --> 00:50:52,519
The slide that you're looking at right now is an excerpt from some of the training that I've been participating in with Leading Now, which is a national organization.

544
00:50:53,659 --> 00:51:09,582
When I went to Denver over the summer, I met and worked with superintendents from East Coast, West Coast, all over Washington State, and it was truly an enriching experience.

545
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:30,914
The Leading Now structure, how the cohorts are set up, they ask us to tackle real life scenarios and problems of practice, which may include, how do I shepherd a wide range of stakeholders to implement new policies?

546
00:51:33,188 --> 00:51:38,152
How can we best use our resources to advance district priorities?

547
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:47,781
The previous presentation that Dr. Cushing and Rachel Perry shared are directly linked to our strategic plan.

548
00:51:48,422 --> 00:51:58,671
How are we leveraging our resources and the materials that we have available to, again, bring greater coherence and meet the needs of our school district?

549
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:16,097
Thirdly, how can we work with board members, which also they use that school committee members, parents, political partners, and community groups in a constructive way that supports student learning.

550
00:52:16,598 --> 00:52:30,988
And again, just the previous presentation gave an example of another opportunity where we're going to be welcoming many stakeholders to be part of an important conversation to bring about

551
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,088
new and improved resources for our students in the area of health.

552
00:52:36,709 --> 00:52:42,482
And I thank our community member who is an expert who shared, you know, off the cuff what she is doing.

553
00:52:43,737 --> 00:53:06,569
To the right on that slide, you can see the concentric circles showing all of the different stakeholder groups, parent and community members, cabinet, principals, teachers, staff, paraprofessionals, secretaries, everyone, students, and our school board, school committee.

554
00:53:07,649 --> 00:53:23,994
And all of these stakeholders working together and the star in the middle, the superintendent trying to collaborate and coordinate all stakeholders again to strengthen and bring forth the best district possible.

555
00:53:25,755 --> 00:53:34,458
The bottom three quotes I'm just gonna share with you are quotes from superintendents who participated in the training during the 21-22 school year.

556
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:42,852
One shared, I haven't worked on my own professional growth since COVID.

557
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:44,752
This was time well spent.

558
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:55,115
I never opened my laptop the whole day we were together, staying focused and not being distracted by emails, which sometimes is hard to do or not to do.

559
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:58,876
System leaders aren't afforded spaces like this enough.

560
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:04,097
It is rare to have opportunities to be vulnerable and authentic.

561
00:54:05,345 --> 00:54:17,132
Another superintendent that was quoted said, I am in two other professional development opportunities this year and leading now is the only one I will consistently prioritize.

562
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:20,034
So again, there's lots of praise.

563
00:54:20,414 --> 00:54:31,561
It creates great opportunities for collaboration and really having thought partners across the nation, which I look forward to that.

564
00:54:35,629 --> 00:54:56,664
So a few key noticings that I do wanna share with the committee members that as we have restructured and I am out in the field, visiting the schools, meeting with principals and administrators and seeing what's happening just during these first few weeks of school.

565
00:54:57,565 --> 00:54:59,746
These are some of the key things that I have noticed.

566
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:04,630
All the schools are wonderfully welcoming and warm.

567
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:08,248
Student engagement is active.

568
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:09,270
Students are learning.

569
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,211
Students are happy.

570
00:55:10,231 --> 00:55:13,514
They are working with their peers.

571
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:23,546
I've had the opportunity, and as I've been entering the buildings, to welcome new staff members who are brand new to Mustang Nation.

572
00:55:25,194 --> 00:55:28,257
and just letting them know that I am happy that they have joined the team.

573
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:45,735
And I haven't gotten to every single new staff person, but as I have been in buildings, depending sometimes they're on planning periods, but as I continue to do the rounds, I will be doing that with all principals to make sure that I get to welcome all new staff.

574
00:55:46,673 --> 00:56:08,022
In addition to that, teachers and staff have been working together to best position our students for a successful year and school administrators have been engaging with families at open house, whether it's open houses, curriculum nights, and many school-based events that have already taken place.

575
00:56:08,642 --> 00:56:15,665
So I really do feel like the school year has gotten off to a very positive start for our community.

576
00:56:19,974 --> 00:56:31,165
There are a few personal professional commitments that I have made knowing that I need to be flexible and nimble, nimble and flexible.

577
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:52,556
I am determined to create additional opportunities such as coffee chats and meet and greets with families, staff, students, and stakeholders that is still being designed how it will roll out, but to roll it out throughout the entire district.

578
00:56:52,896 --> 00:56:53,837
That is a commitment.

579
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:58,498
Addition to that commitment, which was also mentioned added

580
00:56:58,871 --> 00:57:08,436
to the revised goals was to make sure that we conduct the parent surveys and receive feedback so that we can continuously improve.

581
00:57:09,557 --> 00:57:16,280
It is important to be able to get the feedback and look at areas where we can tweak and make the necessary adjustments.

582
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:19,262
And lastly,

583
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:33,278
Participating in professional development, it's great being part of a professional learning community, also called PLCs, which we use sometimes that terminology in schools.

584
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:34,859
We are always learning.

585
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:36,220
We are in education.

586
00:57:37,361 --> 00:57:38,482
It's critically important.

587
00:57:39,728 --> 00:57:53,275
I am so excited that leading now, to be part of leading now, that leading now is part of my story of development for this year, the support, coaching, and professional development that I will continue to receive this year.

588
00:57:54,611 --> 00:58:11,801
And also being part of a professional learning community, I just wanted to say to the entire committee that having a renewed commitment to strategic communications and public engagement, it's going to allow me to stay the course.

589
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:15,542
on my commitment to all students in Medford.

590
00:58:16,283 --> 00:58:29,228
So that this picture here, which was just taken last June, students happy, excited, right there at Hormel celebrating

591
00:58:30,885 --> 00:58:32,486
their time in Medford Public Schools.

592
00:58:32,827 --> 00:58:46,519
And that's my North Star, that's my goal, whether you go on to college or you go on to career, but getting all of our students to that finish line so that they can begin the next chapter of their lives.

593
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:48,801
And I'm open to any questions.

594
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:51,103
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

595
00:58:51,123 --> 00:58:55,747
I know it was a few busy weeks for you during that time.

596
00:58:56,698 --> 00:58:57,679
Thanks for the update.

597
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:01,342
Number five, we have update on Medford public schools, personnel and labor issues.

598
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:05,445
Mr. Dave Murphy, assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

599
00:59:07,006 --> 00:59:07,347
Welcome.

600
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:12,451
Thank you, mayor.

601
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:16,076
Pleasure to be with you tonight.

602
00:59:17,898 --> 00:59:28,910
As it says on the agenda, we'll be touching base with respect to both where we are with respect to our collective bargaining negotiations, which are ongoing, as well as where we are

603
00:59:30,211 --> 00:59:45,081
I'll just say very briefly on the personnel front to pick up where we left off at the, I believe, the September 12th meeting was the last personnel update, at which time there were, we estimated, 17 vacancies in the paraprofessional ranks.

604
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:50,106
That number now is 12 as of this moment.

605
00:59:51,608 --> 00:59:55,374
Part of our challenge on the personnel front is these numbers fluctuate.

606
00:59:55,434 --> 01:00:02,063
And so it is my hope that tomorrow morning that number will still be 12, or at least moving in a downward direction.

607
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:06,893
But we have additional interviews scheduled.

608
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:16,100
There's the teaching – from a teaching position perspective, it's a little more complicated because of some long-term substitute situations.

609
01:00:16,201 --> 01:00:24,848
But generally speaking, those numbers have stabilized over the last couple of weeks, so we feel pretty comfortable where we are on the personnel side.

610
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:31,453
With respect to our collective bargaining negotiations, as the superintendent announced

611
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:40,204
agreement last week with our paraprofessionals, as well as our Kids Corner staff bargaining unit.

612
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:48,528
And with your vote this evening, as the mayor said at the beginning of the meeting, those agreements are now finalized.

613
01:00:48,748 --> 01:01:01,954
And the district, and I know the union leadership as well, are happy and proud that we've been able to take a significant step forward with respect to pay equity for both of those two units.

614
01:01:03,428 --> 01:01:04,649
So that's where we are in those.

615
01:01:04,669 --> 01:01:12,172
There's ongoing negotiations with our custodian and security monitor bargaining units.

616
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:20,356
And as you know, and as we'll talk a little bit about tonight, our teaching negotiations are ongoing as well.

617
01:01:20,436 --> 01:01:27,980
So in the update that was provided to you, this is a document that will be on our website, which will be

618
01:01:30,933 --> 01:01:39,660
of the things that we need to update the community on on a regular basis, the pandemic and our protocols related to COVID come to mind as one.

619
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:52,429
This will, all the documents related to the negotiations with the Medford Teachers Association will be in one place so people can access them easily.

620
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:58,514
If we go to the next slide, you can see there that that's where we are in terms of all of our bargaining units.

621
01:02:00,185 --> 01:02:04,426
We have not yet begun with cafeteria employees or administrators for two different reasons.

622
01:02:04,486 --> 01:02:09,348
The cafeteria employees were on a different cycle than the other bargaining units, and so their contract just expired.

623
01:02:09,368 --> 01:02:15,430
Obviously, we've had some initial conversations with the SEIU representatives, but have not yet got to the table there.

624
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:26,794
And then our administrators just elected a new bargaining representative, and so we were prohibited from engaging in those discussions up until this point, but I would anticipate that they will begin in the near future.

625
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:42,056
Most of the next slide is information that you've seen before, but we did want to provide a higher level of specificity in response to some of the questions that we've received based on the other updates.

626
01:02:42,116 --> 01:02:44,157
So you'll see that top table there.

627
01:02:44,978 --> 01:02:53,382
That indicates the cost of living adjustments that were in the previous three MTA collective bargaining agreements.

628
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:59,485
As you can see from going back to the beginning part of the last decade, the wage was a 6.62.

629
01:03:00,605 --> 01:03:08,629
That was the result of a split halfway through one of the bargaining years, and I believe a smaller percentage that was tacked on to the beginning of that cycle.

630
01:03:08,649 --> 01:03:15,552
6.5% had been consistent generally with a 2-2-2 and then a split in the final year of the contract.

631
01:03:16,052 --> 01:03:17,432
for the previous two CBAs.

632
01:03:17,952 --> 01:03:38,236
And then you can see that the MTA's current proposal of exceeding 10% in the initial proposal, which as the union has said to you on several public occasions, has said publicly on several occasions, I should say, that the 18% initial proposal was grounded in a comparison with respect to inflation.

633
01:03:39,257 --> 01:03:41,797
I won't go into the same level of detail

634
01:03:44,879 --> 01:03:58,891
of a municipal capacity and why it's impossible for us as a municipality or as a school district to match the numbers of inflation, particularly in the current economic conditions.

635
01:03:58,991 --> 01:04:08,700
But that explanation is detailed in a pretty high level of specificity for September 12th, in our September

636
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,500
about the communication.

637
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:24,489
So for members of the community that are trying to sort of get up to speed as to where we are with respect to those negotiations, I would encourage you to refer to the first slide here, which provides all the previous documentation that we've discussed in this forum.

638
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:39,053
Our analysis of the surrounding communities and other negotiations throughout the Commonwealth, and a lot of them are ongoing, some of them start at different points, so it's sort of impossible to put a very firm number on it.

639
01:04:39,974 --> 01:04:42,356
But generally speaking, we're seeing about 7%, so a little

640
01:04:43,957 --> 01:05:00,738
a little over what we've been able to provide in Medford historically, and in order to maintain competitiveness, while also always having fidelity to our sustainability responsibilities, our current offer and the offer that

641
01:05:01,919 --> 01:05:08,905
was on the table at the time of the impasse declaration and continues to be on the table.

642
01:05:08,945 --> 01:05:21,436
The 7.25%, which does not include the $1,000 per year per teacher money that we are offering as a result of the COVID-related grants.

643
01:05:21,677 --> 01:05:27,122
So that's the temporary funding that the district has access to for a short period of time coming out of the pandemic.

644
01:05:28,522 --> 01:05:36,665
I've spelled out for you in the past the administration's rationale as to why we believe this is an appropriate and prudent use of those resources.

645
01:05:38,085 --> 01:05:41,226
I will say that it is a considerable use of those resources.

646
01:05:41,306 --> 01:05:52,670
So to invest $1,000 per employee per year in non-based compensation in this instance amounts to in the vicinity of $1.5 million.

647
01:05:55,791 --> 01:06:05,859
Well, I think the administration has will continue to try to maintain as professional and respectful dialogue with our bargaining partners as possible.

648
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:18,830
I would be remiss if I didn't say that for the MTA president to say that that money quote does not count when speaking before the Medford City Council recently was disappointing.

649
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:34,444
And it's challenging from a discourse perspective, because whether it's grant money or operating money, when the district expends $1.5 million of money that can go toward a variety of causes, not any, it's not,

650
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:42,590
an infinite number of causes that we can put that money toward, but certainly there's plenty of things that we can do to have a direct impact on students.

651
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:57,639
And so I do think that all stakeholders have a responsibility to be cognizant of that and of the implications of that type of multimillion dollar investment that again, the district has put on the table and would like to make.

652
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,402
With that money, it would bring

653
01:07:02,802 --> 01:07:13,627
immediate payment to members of the teacher's bargaining unit to over 9% in compensation during the life of the contract.

654
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:18,590
As has been stated, and as is true, that is not entirely based compensation.

655
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:31,416
But the correlation here is that it is money that we're able to provide our current teachers who have worked through some very, very difficult and challenging circumstances

656
01:07:32,236 --> 01:07:41,521
and as we've said in this forum before, who are continuing to work through very difficult and challenging circumstances as we move through the pandemic.

657
01:07:43,262 --> 01:07:45,464
That is something that we have available to us.

658
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:58,851
We're grateful to have that option available to us as a result of the federal legislation and the state allocation to the city of Medford and to the Medford public schools, but it's not funding we have available to us in perpetuity.

659
01:07:59,811 --> 01:08:18,272
And so to expend that funding via base pay increases, which in fact do last in perpetuity, would create a structural financial deficit that would force us to reduce positions in the future.

660
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:21,055
And it is inevitable

661
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:32,492
that the positions that we would have to look at reducing are some of the additional supports that we've been able to bring in to support some of our most vulnerable students.

662
01:08:33,153 --> 01:08:45,221
And so I think right now we're in a situation, not so much tonight, but frequently this conversation is unfolding with a tremendous amount of noise.

663
01:08:46,342 --> 01:08:50,865
And in my experience, conducting a negotiation

664
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:55,160
with a high level of noise is challenging.

665
01:08:56,041 --> 01:09:05,629
And I think what I find most constructive is to take a step back and try to look at the question in as simple a manner as possible.

666
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:09,072
And in this instance, really there are two questions.

667
01:09:10,033 --> 01:09:16,098
One is what we're offering responsible, meaning is it sustainable?

668
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,341
And two, is it competitive?

669
01:09:20,453 --> 01:09:27,922
And we are answering that question based on the point of comparisons that we have available to us.

670
01:09:28,523 --> 01:09:39,055
So in comparison to what we've always offered historically, both with respect to base pay and additional compensation, this number significantly exceeds what we've done.

671
01:09:40,151 --> 01:09:42,373
with respect to what's happening in other communities.

672
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:45,455
And I'm not saying there aren't outliers, because of course there always are.

673
01:09:46,135 --> 01:09:52,160
But generally speaking, this is very competitive when looked at through that lens from a market perspective.

674
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,903
And then I think finally, just in terms of the numbers that are on here,

675
01:09:56,543 --> 01:10:13,337
And I think most of us who work in this field, or frankly anyone who's ever had the opportunity to benefit from a teacher that influences them or opens doors for them, we know that our median salary of $86,000 is nowhere close to as high as we'd like it to be.

676
01:10:14,226 --> 01:10:36,598
But it's very rare that you are in a sphere of public education where the people that are doing this day in and day out, whether they're an administrator or a teacher or anything else, frankly, an elected official, very few of us think that having an average salary of $85,000, $86,000 is somehow commensurate with the impact that teachers can have.

677
01:10:36,798 --> 01:10:37,978
It's not, and it's never been.

678
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:42,521
But there's a different question as to whether it is competitive.

679
01:10:43,201 --> 01:11:01,517
And in the analysis that the district has done and looking in this market in this region, our current median salary of $86,000 and our projected median salary just next year if what we've proposed were to go into effect of $93,000 is competitive.

680
01:11:04,884 --> 01:11:18,305
I don't argue that it's enough, and I don't think the person, me or anyone else in this type of role is ever going to argue that it's enough, because the more competitive we can be, the better off this district is going to be and the better off the students of Bedford are going to be.

681
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:32,211
If we act in an irresponsible manner, and if we institute pay increases that are beyond what we can sustain, it is inevitable that it will have a negative impact on students.

682
01:11:32,771 --> 01:11:36,074
And so that is why we've taken the positions that we have.

683
01:11:36,715 --> 01:11:42,401
And with respect to why those positions are being now discussed publicly,

684
01:11:44,505 --> 01:12:06,800
I would say it's because we as an administration essentially ran out of options at the table, which is why we sought – we are seeking a neutral mediator from the state to help us to break the stalemate and try to get back to a place where the contract can be resolved, the individual members of the teachers union who now

685
01:12:09,634 --> 01:12:22,648
but on average $4,400 waiting for them once this contract is resolved because if you factor in the retroactive payments and the one-time payments that the moment are still on the table from the district it's a significant payout

686
01:12:24,562 --> 01:12:38,386
And I think there's a need to, we believe as the district, to move past this and start getting back to the work of running the district with the necessary collaboration with each of our bargaining partners.

687
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:41,507
We are eager to do that.

688
01:12:41,907 --> 01:12:45,468
We think doing that is an urgent priority.

689
01:12:46,109 --> 01:12:53,051
But to get to that point recklessly, which is what a 10% increase

690
01:12:54,492 --> 01:12:58,335
would do, which is what's been on the table, that that's not something we can do.

691
01:12:59,796 --> 01:13:01,017
Just to go to the next slide.

692
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:05,500
Again, this is somewhat of a recap from last time, and I've kind of covered it already this evening.

693
01:13:06,301 --> 01:13:15,748
When the MTA presented on June 6th, they estimated that our operating budget could sustain a 2.25% increase.

694
01:13:16,869 --> 01:13:19,331
That is not something that the district has a strong disagreement with.

695
01:13:19,371 --> 01:13:22,534
That's about accurate with respect to what our budgetary capacity is.

696
01:13:23,234 --> 01:13:41,988
Our disagreement really comes down to what was presented on June 6th, which is that we should use the temporary grant funding to inflate the base pay in a way that there is no specific plan, a reliable plan to fund beyond next year.

697
01:13:42,688 --> 01:13:46,511
And while this, again, there's a lot of noise, there's a lot of back and forth,

698
01:13:48,246 --> 01:13:58,695
I'm disappointed by some of what's been communicated, particularly in recent days, particularly in a negotiation that there aren't any other issues that we know of, at least that are on the table.

699
01:14:07,797 --> 01:14:10,659
identical language or actually had signed tentative agreements on.

700
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:16,584
So the issues are relatively narrow, but that means that our options are relatively narrow as well.

701
01:14:17,325 --> 01:14:22,089
And it's our hope that we will be able to have a resolution as quickly as possible.

702
01:14:23,611 --> 01:14:24,612
This is a timeline.

703
01:14:24,912 --> 01:14:38,848
This goes back to when the initial conversations in the summer of 2021 and the negotiations beginning at the union's request in November of 2021 and then a summary just with respect to

704
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,289
where we go from here.

705
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:51,213
I guess one development since our September 12th presentation to you, the MTA did file an objection to our request for mediation.

706
01:14:51,233 --> 01:14:56,875
So to be clear, again, for those maybe watching or listening to this for the first time,

707
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:13,077
After 10 months and close to 20 bargaining sessions and after the issues were narrowed to this question over the compensation increase, the superintendent recommended and the school committee voted to approve an impasse declaration.

708
01:15:13,818 --> 01:15:16,822
By doing so, we're able to request a neutral mediator.

709
01:15:17,563 --> 01:15:21,586
to help support the negotiations and work with both parties to try to come to a resolution.

710
01:15:22,427 --> 01:15:31,434
What was communicated on September 12th to you by representatives of the MTA was there was disappointment that in the belief that that would somehow delay the process.

711
01:15:32,635 --> 01:15:36,678
Having lived through this with DLR a few times before I will tell you that had the objection not

712
01:15:38,376 --> 01:15:43,697
been filed by the M. T. A. We would already have a mediator and we would be in mediation right now.

713
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:50,379
Um, and it's it's my hope that, uh, one way or another that will that will happen soon.

714
01:15:50,419 --> 01:15:55,700
Because, as I said, it's really not in anyone's interest for this to go on indefinitely.

715
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,361
And so we're hopeful toe to be able to reach an amicable resolution in the near future.

716
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:02,382
And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.

717
01:16:04,782 --> 01:16:05,502
Thank you, Mr Murphy.

718
01:16:06,543 --> 01:16:07,403
We appreciate the update.

719
01:16:07,683 --> 01:16:07,963
Thank you.

720
01:16:11,516 --> 01:16:16,158
We do not have any continued business or new business or reports requested.

721
01:16:16,298 --> 01:16:19,099
So moving on to number 10, our condolences.

722
01:16:19,759 --> 01:16:34,085
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of former city councilor, William A. Carr Sr., a former English teacher at the former Lincoln Junior High School and former guidance director at Medford High School.

723
01:16:35,105 --> 01:16:39,667
Also, the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Teresa,

724
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:49,384
Piso Cardillo, age 90, a lifetime resident of Medford and mother of Joanne Mortel, benefits coordinator in the business center.

725
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,088
If we take a moment of silence.

726
01:17:08,428 --> 01:17:11,251
Our next meeting will be on Monday, October 17th.

727
01:17:12,012 --> 01:17:16,517
Regular school committee meeting here in the Allman Memorial Chambers as well as on Zoom.

728
01:17:17,118 --> 01:17:19,621
Hope everybody has a great rest of the week.

729
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:21,062
Is there a motion to adjourn?

730
01:17:23,345 --> 01:17:24,146
Motion to adjourn.

731
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:25,407
Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

732
01:17:25,427 --> 01:17:26,228
All those in favor?

733
01:17:26,568 --> 01:17:26,909
Aye.

734
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:27,990
