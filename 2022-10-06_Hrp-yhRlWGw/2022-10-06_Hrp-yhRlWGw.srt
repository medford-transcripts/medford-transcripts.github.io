00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:27,209

33
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:13,980

59
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:20,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate the quote of the late Rabbi Jonathan Sachs, who once said, the most important lesson of the high holidays is that nothing, nothing is broken beyond repair.

[SPEAKER_07]: To our Italian-American friends, and forgive me if I botch it a little bit, Feliz Mese del Eredita Italo-Americana.

00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:10,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy Italian-American Heritage Month.

94
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:12,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And I close with a poem.

95
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,640
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, it's called Hello, October.

96
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:27,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, one of the best things you can do for yourself is taking time to learn and grow.

97
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:39,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you give yourself patience, you become your best friend and the empathy, self-kindness and resilience are what you need to grow.

98
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you and have a good evening.

99
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:43,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:45,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

101

[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, we have report on chapter 74.

102
00:10:49,548 --> 00:11:05,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Vocational Programming at Medford High School in the 2022-2023 school year, Dr. Peter J. Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment and Innovation, and Mr. Chad Fallon, Principal Director of Medford Vocational Technical High School Programs.

103
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:08,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

104
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:20,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee for this opportunity to present the annual presentation on Chapter 74 programming.

105
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:39,218
[SPEAKER_09]: As Mr. Fallon will detail in his presentation, the vocational school is seeing great expanses and expansion within its programs and is doing a really great job supporting our students with these hands-on, real-world learning applications.

106
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Fallon.

107
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

108
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:42,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

109
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to see everybody.

110
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:46,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna give you guys an update on what we've been up to over the past year.

111
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:54,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, when I was looking at my presentation from last time, I'm not sure that we did this last year because of, I'm not sure I couldn't find it.

112
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:55,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it two years ago.

113
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:56,309
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all about remote learning.

114
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I was happy to kind of turn the page on that.

115
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna introduce some new staff this year that we hired.

116
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:06,613
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, his name is Andrew Theobald, and he's in the picture to the right, actually.

117
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:08,814
[SPEAKER_08]: He is our new automotive technology instructor.

118
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,379
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we also hired a metal fabrication instructor, Mr. Curtis Jackson, who's on the left.

119
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:20,085
[SPEAKER_08]: When I went into the space to take pictures of the teachers, the students were more than happy to jump into the picture with them.

120
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just let it happen.

121
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:26,213
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's some of the automotive and some of the metal fab students, two great additions to our team.

122
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:32,063
[SPEAKER_08]: We have been doing some renovations.

123
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:37,367
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, no report is usually complete on my end in case I haven't broken down some walls.

124
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,408
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm gonna fill you in on what we've done.

125
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:49,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Cosmetology, as you know, the salon opened a year ago, but we finally moved the grade nine and 10 classroom up to the room next to the salon, which actually already had glass windows installed.

126
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:52,257
[SPEAKER_08]: So now the freshmen and sophomores can look into the salon.

127
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:54,458
[SPEAKER_08]: The two teachers are together now.

128
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:05,795
[SPEAKER_08]: We renovated our Make Way for Kids and our early childhood education program, the Make Way for Kids program, which is a nursery school for little tykes on three days a week in the morning.

129
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:11,939
[SPEAKER_08]: We moved them from the cosmetology space downstairs to a ground level floor room.

130
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a picture that you see there that's completely redone with new carpet walls, window treatments, and some plumbing.

131
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:21,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can go to the next slide.

132
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:22,987
[SPEAKER_08]: The electrical department,

133
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,111
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, there's booths that the students work in.

134
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:29,912
[SPEAKER_08]: They were splintered and old, so we needed to replace all the booths.

135
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:32,093
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a project that the carpentry students took on.

136
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:37,114
[SPEAKER_08]: They removed all the booths on the left side of the shop and replaced them with brand new booths for the students to work in.

137
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:41,996
[SPEAKER_08]: The room on the right, on the top, is just a picture of the cosmetology-related room.

138
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:45,837
[SPEAKER_08]: The teacher did an incredible job getting it to where it is now.

139
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:50,019
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't really see it, but off in the back are the windows that look into the salon.

140
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the bottom right is a picture of graphic design.

141
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:55,264
[SPEAKER_08]: It was completed last spring.

142
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:58,187
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are two rooms that have been combined.

143
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:06,733
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the former cosmetology space, which is now custom desks that were built by the carpentry students and new computers in that space.

144
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:13,138
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mustang Mall also moved to a new location on our side of the building.

145
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:14,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where King Falls is.

146
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick report on the Skills Capital Grant.

147
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:27,157
[SPEAKER_08]: If you remember correctly, the Skills Capital Grant is awarded to vocational technical schools and this was our third time receiving it.

148
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:36,362
[SPEAKER_08]: This time we had just under $365,000 and this was directly funded for the Construction Craft Laborers Program.

149
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:41,660
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as our other construction trade programs, electrical, carpentry, and metal fabrication.

150
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:48,284
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just one picture on the left of many pieces of equipment that we got.

151
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:51,406
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my students here to the right who's in the program could tell you more.

152
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:53,747
[SPEAKER_08]: We completely

153
00:14:56,491 --> 00:15:01,034
[SPEAKER_08]: outfitted the shop with the type of materials that students would need out in the workforce.

154
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:12,082
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have that, we have a couple pickup trucks, we have a lowboy dump trailer, we have equipment inside that won't even leave the shop, and then we have other stuff that we're using on job sites.

155
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:14,003
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're really happy about that.

156
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:30,289
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was, I just have to do a special thank you to the teachers in that program, Mr. Danny Kelly, Mr. Ralph Taleva, Mr. Larry Brown, and of course to my amazing administrative assistant Gina Citrano, who kind of pulled it all together for us on the budget end.

157
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:31,590
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks to that team.

158
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,396
[SPEAKER_08]: We also were recently awarded a Mass Life Sciences grant that we applied for.

159
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,640
[SPEAKER_08]: just under $120,000.

160
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,745
[SPEAKER_08]: $20,000 will be put towards professional development and the remaining is for supplies and materials for our biotechnology program.

161
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:57,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't really see it, but what you can see on the left is kind of a

162
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:04,420
[SPEAKER_08]: over the last six or seven years, the enrollment shift in our career and technical education pathway.

163
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see it's steadily rising up.

164
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:12,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Nearly 45% of the students in the high school complex right now are on a CTE pathway.

165
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:15,547
[SPEAKER_08]: On the right, that figure shows you grade nine.

166
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:21,371
[SPEAKER_08]: So blue would be CTE grade nine, and the orange is the overall enrollment.

167
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:23,753
[SPEAKER_08]: So this year, for example, it's about

168
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:29,931
[SPEAKER_08]: 60-something percent of the freshmen right now at the high school are choosing CTE Exploratory.

169
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:41,080
[SPEAKER_08]: If we look at last year, I think there was, I think we had about 250 students go through Exploratory and about 160 of them stayed on as sophomores.

170
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,363
[SPEAKER_08]: So that kind of gives you an idea, you know, the blue is creeping up.

171
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:48,105
[SPEAKER_08]: So that last column on the right shows that there's

172
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:54,746
[SPEAKER_08]: know, essentially any student who wants to participate in CTE Exploratory is able to do so at night school.

173
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,433
[SPEAKER_08]: We continue to work with our partners in our workforce development initiative.

174
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,995
[SPEAKER_08]: We have cooperative education that's going strong.

175
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:09,595
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a new

176
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:15,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Grinley, who retired the second time from us just in the spring.

177
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:27,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So now between myself and Alice Beth Fitzpatrick, our assistant director, we're working with a teacher who's just recently been licensed for co-op in the state of Massachusetts, Ms.

178
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:33,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Holly Farnham-Cassebon, and she is going to be our co-op coordinator as a stipend position.

179
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:42,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Those, that kind of word out there is just many of the partners that we work with now and the many of the jobs that our students are out on.

180
00:17:42,113 --> 00:17:47,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just wanted to make sure that those are front and center because they support us just as much as we support them.

181
00:17:51,613 --> 00:18:00,016
[SPEAKER_08]: For our professional development this year, our focus has been built around a lot of the work we've done with the REVIS training in support of five core actions.

182
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:10,020
[SPEAKER_08]: We started the year by saying content is important, but we're really looking to, when we're in the classrooms, we're gonna be looking for how you're building those positive relationships with students.

183
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was an agreed upon look for that we decided as administrators, what we're gonna look for when we go into classrooms.

184
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:18,270
[SPEAKER_08]: also spent a lot of time on building connections.

185
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:28,118
[SPEAKER_08]: At the beginning of the year, we sent these kind of stress ball type building blocks to the whole school in an effort to remind people that we are building connections for both sides.

186
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,981
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of that being our theme,

187
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:44,336
[SPEAKER_08]: building the positive relationships with students, which ties right into social-emotional learning, and then some curriculum work, because a lot of the standards for the Mass Vocational Frameworks have changed or been revised.

188
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:53,783
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to be spending this year really aligning our curriculum, making sure teachers have a clear understanding of what they're teaching and students know why they're learning it.

189
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:59,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions?

190
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes, I want to thank you for the report.

191
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:06,798
[SPEAKER_11]: It was great.

192
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,362
[SPEAKER_11]: And last year I got to

193
00:19:09,154 --> 00:19:12,557
[SPEAKER_11]: go to the live open house and see some of the updated programs.

194
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:13,597
[SPEAKER_11]: They look fantastic.

195
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:20,462
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to know if you would briefly be able to describe what the mass core framework is.

196
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:25,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I got it described in an email and I just thought it was very interesting.

197
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:27,968
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you were able to share it, if you could do that.

198
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:29,569
[SPEAKER_11]: So mass core?

199
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:30,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

200
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, mass core is the state.

201
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:39,069
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't, I mean, math core doesn't really fit into my piece of the puzzle.

202
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:40,269
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean the frameworks that we use?

203
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:41,170
[SPEAKER_08]: The frameworks, yes.

204
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:41,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sorry.

205
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:49,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So just like an English or math curriculum, there are frameworks for every vocational technical program that's offered.

206
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:52,953
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them have been revised and it takes years to be done.

207
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:54,754
[SPEAKER_08]: So now like the automotive curriculum is new.

208
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:59,235
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're gonna need to figure out how that looks when we're using it in theory.

209
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:05,356
[SPEAKER_08]: So for our frameworks, oftentimes it's a lot of documentation.

210
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:10,537
[SPEAKER_08]: There's many different standards within each program's frameworks, one being embedded academics.

211
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:14,998
[SPEAKER_08]: So with every program we have, there's a crossover of literacy and numeracy skills.

212
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:17,578
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need to make sure the teachers are comfortable doing that.

213
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,779
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a safety component and there's a technical content, which everyone has.

214
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:28,020
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's basically the part of the frameworks that tells the teacher what is it that should be taught by the time these students leave high school.

215
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:30,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

216
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:36,197
[SPEAKER_11]: And do you know when the fall advisory meeting is going to be?

217
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:39,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, is there going to be, like, in the fall advisory meeting?

218
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, November 8th.

219
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:41,602
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll all be getting a save the date.

220
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:42,583
Oh, great.

221
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:43,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

222
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,466
[SPEAKER_11]: And one last thing.

223
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:49,109
[SPEAKER_11]: When my son was at the vocational as a student,

224
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:55,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, there was some limitations with the scheduling, um, with extracurriculars in world language.

225
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:06,381
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was just wondering, um, if, if that's going to be something that might be worked on into the schedules where, um, those opportunities might be more available for the students, for the CTE students.

226
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,742
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can get a new master schedule, that's the goal.

227
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:09,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

228
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:10,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what I know.

229
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:19,144
[SPEAKER_11]: I had received some information in an email, but I just wanted to kind of just put that out there that that's something that I believe the district, the administration's working on to try and

230
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:21,668
[SPEAKER_11]: get the schedule and get that in there.

231
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:26,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we've really done all the band-aiding we can do at this point.

232
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,991
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, we are ready for any schedule.

233
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:30,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

234
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:31,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

235
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:33,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate it.

236
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:35,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin and Member Mustone.

237
00:21:39,017 --> 00:21:40,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say thank you for the rapport.

238
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:48,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really good seeing everyone at curriculum night the other night and the great turnout and the increased attendance and interest in our vocational school.

239
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:49,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that you guys have all done that.

240
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:51,806
[SPEAKER_03]: or collectively, it looks great over there.

241
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:53,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope people are taking a tour around.

242
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:56,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just excited by the opportunities for our students.

243
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:57,628
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

244
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:58,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

245
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:02,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

246
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just wondering, I saw, I don't know if you want to go two slides back.

247
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:13,932
[SPEAKER_10]: So last year there was 199 ninth graders who did CTE, right?

248
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:16,973
[SPEAKER_10]: It jumped to 269 this current year for ninth graders.

249
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:19,808
[SPEAKER_08]: I think last year was more than one, but was it, did it say 199?

250
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:21,508
[SPEAKER_08]: But okay.

251
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:26,270
[SPEAKER_10]: How many 10th graders then chose to stay in the vocational school?

252
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:26,270
160.

253
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

254
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,991
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a very large percentage.

255
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:30,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Our largest ever.

256
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:39,575
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, it was one of those moments that we were like excited, but also frightened because it was like, okay, we get, we need to make sure we have

257
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:49,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So 160 from say 200, I don't know who has the slides, but so then do you expect, so this current ninth grade class is 269.

258
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:57,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think you'll get 200 students then choosing to the vocational school in 10th grade?

259
00:22:58,492 --> 00:23:01,835
[SPEAKER_08]: If we keep trending the way we are, then the data would say yes.

260
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:06,859
[SPEAKER_10]: So then would that lead you to, are you considering adding shops?

261
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:09,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes and no.

262
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:12,752
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a constraint right now, and that's the building space.

263
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:13,993
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no room.

264
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:21,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this program we'd love to offer, but we're not at the point yet that we don't have enough seats in our current programs for our students.

265
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:30,468
[SPEAKER_08]: With the increase in enrollment, and actually everything lands really nicely because we still have seats in two or three different programs.

266
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:32,831
[SPEAKER_08]: But absolutely, in the future.

267
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:39,983
[SPEAKER_10]: And then do we have any students in Medford who are going to other vocational schools because they're looking for a shop we don't offer?

268
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:40,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

269
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:46,067
[SPEAKER_08]: One to Minute Man for plumbing and one to Minute Man for horticulture, but she's a junior.

270
00:23:46,387 --> 00:23:48,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a two-year commitment for us.

271
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:48,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

272
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,291
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not like there's something out there that people are looking for at another shop?

273
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:52,892
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just plumbing.

274
00:23:52,912 --> 00:24:00,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Plumbing would be the next one I'd open because that's, and you know that when a parent comes to me and expresses their concern, I'm like, well, you should go to Minute Man 100% because they have a program.

275
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:01,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah.

276
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:02,905
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's great.

277
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:07,108
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a few that went to Essex, but that person graduated and we had another one from an event.

278
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:08,809
[SPEAKER_08]: We usually average about one a year.

279
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:09,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

280
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:10,570
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

281
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

282
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Principal Fallon and Dr. Cushing.

283
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:23,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to also add that the cosmetology renovations, as has been mentioned previously, but with such a generous donation,

284
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:29,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford alumni Charles Hoth named it in honor of his mother Priscilla Hoth.

285
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:41,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's just a really great member of the community coming back and putting their wallet in full support of our students and really developing an amazing space for them to work.

286
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:43,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

287
00:24:43,637 --> 00:24:44,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

288
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:44,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

289
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:45,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

290
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,340
[SPEAKER_04]: We have

291
00:24:50,396 --> 00:24:52,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Our third report, Health Education Curriculum Review.

292
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:58,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Peter J. Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Enrichment and Innovation, and Ms.

293
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:02,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel Perry, Director of Physical and Health Education.

294
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:03,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

295
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:08,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Just give me one second to pull up the presentation.

296
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:24,564
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, once again, good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

297
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:39,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to stand before you tonight with Rachel Perry to discuss the health education curriculum review process and the team that will be created to conduct this year long review of this.

298
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:46,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Rachel brought this to me a few weeks ago and upon review really seemed like the way that we should be going.

299
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:50,335
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm gonna turn over to Rachel now for some of our slides.

300
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:53,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.

301
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:54,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having us.

302
00:25:55,077 --> 00:25:59,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So to start, what I'm going to talk a little bit about is the history of health education in Medford.

303
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:09,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-2013, we were using the second step curriculum at the elementary level and the body shop curriculums at the secondary level.

304
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:17,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Michigan model skills-based health curriculum was piloted and chosen to be used at both levels to replace those out-of-date curriculums.

305
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:19,213
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2013-2014 school year,

306
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:28,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Michigan model was started at the high school level, and in 14-15, we started that at the middle school level.

307
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:44,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I started the position in the 2015-2016 school year, and we looked at the Michigan model SEL units and piloted that in 2015 and 16, and then we adopted that in the 2016-17 year for the elementary schools.

308
00:26:49,375 --> 00:27:13,406
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, what I did with my staff is we put together our curriculum, we aligned it to the state and national standards, looking at the state standards, those are from 1999, those were very old, so we really started to look more at the national standards and we aligned what we were doing at that time to the national standards and we found that there was a gap in the sexual health.

309
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:14,331
[SPEAKER_02]: piece.

310
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:24,196
[SPEAKER_02]: We added that to the high school curriculum in 2017 and 2018, using an abstinence-based sexual health curriculum.

311
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:31,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 2021-22, it was added to the middle school curriculum.

312
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the recent updates.

313
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:43,956
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're looking to do now, looking at, we've been using the Michigan model starting a little bit around 2013, right after that.

314
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:48,817
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost been 10 years, so it's time to really take a look at what we're doing and evaluate that.

315
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:55,679
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to do that, we're taking a look at the HECAT, which is the Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool.

316
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:05,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an assessment tool developed by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in partnership with health education experts from state and local education agencies.

317
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:09,610
[SPEAKER_02]: schools, colleges, and universities, and national organizations.

318
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:21,359
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose is to provide state, regional, and local education agencies with a common set of tools to assist with the selection of development of health education curricula.

319
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:28,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the bottom of that slide, it goes over exactly what topics we'll be evaluating.

320
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:51,539
[SPEAKER_02]: The HECAT draws upon synthesis of research and criteria based upon findings from the Center of Disease Control's guidelines for school health programs, which identifies common characteristics of effective programs in priority health topic areas, the national education, health education standards, guidance from the U.S.

321
00:28:51,559 --> 00:29:00,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Education Office of Safe and Healthy Schools, expertise of CDC health and behavioral scientists and health education specialists,

322
00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:05,847
[SPEAKER_02]: and expertise of health education researchers and practitioners from the field.

323
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:10,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the HECAT process steps.

324
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:15,671
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is looking at the decision tree recommendations.

325
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:19,913
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have that before you, but I've already evaluated that.

326
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:23,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And we already have a scope and sequence in place.

327
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:25,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have a curriculum.

328
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:31,808
[SPEAKER_02]: The next step it asks is if the curriculum is aligned with the HECAT and it is not.

329
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:38,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, what we would need to do is perform an analysis using the HECAT of our current curriculum.

330
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:47,739
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, next we would identify a health education curriculum coordinator, which I believe we already have.

331
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:48,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be me.

332
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:55,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there we form a health education curriculum review team and we obtain

333
00:29:56,425 --> 00:30:01,707
[SPEAKER_02]: put together our curriculum and our assessments, and orient the members of the team.

334
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:06,429
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll evaluate what we're doing, looking at our curriculum and all of our assessments.

335
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:10,951
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a review, and then we develop a timeline.

336
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:23,236
[SPEAKER_02]: After the curriculum analysis is complete, we convene a meeting and review and discuss the completed analysis, reviewing scores, and we rank the curricula.

337
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:33,141
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, we make curriculum recommendations and we assign curriculum revisions and supplementations and improvements to a writing team.

338
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:37,464
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, we make decisions on where we're gonna go with that.

339
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:51,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at our timeline that we've put together, we'd like to use October this month to create that committee, have the committee meet from November, 2022 through May of 2023,

340
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:59,173
[SPEAKER_02]: and then complete our evaluation, submit recommendations by June of 2023.

341
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:07,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And then implementation of the recommendations, it would be implemented when we were approved and budgeted.

342
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:17,094
[SPEAKER_09]: So before you is a table of people who might serve on the PCAP review process.

343
00:31:17,935 --> 00:31:23,599
[SPEAKER_09]: So school and district curriculum specialists, school or district administrator, school board members.

344
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So at the next meeting, hopefully this board would be able to recommend a member who would be willing to serve.

345
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:34,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Elementary teacher, middle school teacher, high school teacher.

346
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:37,991
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't have to read them all to you, you can read them.

347
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:48,890
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a comprehensive committee to really take an in-depth look at our health curriculum and make recommendations based upon the research and the science.

348
00:31:49,468 --> 00:31:59,713
[SPEAKER_09]: that is out there now and hopefully based on the Massachusetts curriculum standards, which here's a timeline from a DESE presentation.

349
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:05,456
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a source from a June 2019 Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.

350
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:14,081
[SPEAKER_09]: The expectation was that the draft results would have been out sometime in winter 2019, winter 2020.

351
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:19,387
[SPEAKER_09]: for a variety of potential reasons.

352
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:27,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Those have yet to be released and a board vote of the board of elementary and secondary education has not taken place.

353
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:38,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I received a phone call from the department of elementary and secondary education today saying that they're still trying to schedule these standards to be reviewed.

354
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:45,432
[SPEAKER_09]: But given that we're now 23 years on, and if I'm correct, these are the last major curriculum standards

355
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:53,309
[SPEAKER_09]: that have not been revised and implemented in the cadre of curriculum frameworks.

356
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,552
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the next ones to become hopefully reviewed and implemented.

357
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:12,596
[SPEAKER_09]: This committee will have this work done within the school year, and we'll look to create a very well-versed and broad ranging committee to help support this work.

358
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:18,111
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will take any questions or comments you may have.

359
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:22,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin, Member Graham, Member Kratz.

360
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:23,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

361
00:33:25,057 --> 00:33:26,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the presentation.

362
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:27,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely an ambitious schedule.

363
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:29,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like you guys are going to be really busy.

364
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:43,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have a couple of questions about how the PCAT review team will be selected, how we'll be addressing diversity and equity for the selection of the team, and also

365
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:48,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, I don't see a family representative on there, and I just wanted to make that recommendation.

366
00:33:48,770 --> 00:34:02,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also would make a recommendation for a special education representative and a EL representative, especially as we're thinking about how items translate, how words have varying meanings among different cultures.

367
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:12,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would especially think about if we could differentiate instruction and universal design for learning for students with disabilities, as you can imagine, especially around

368
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:16,128
[SPEAKER_03]: sex education, puberty, that sort of stuff.

369
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:28,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly have resources that I can share with you around some other curriculums that we've experienced that have been great, but definitely want us to be proactive as we're thinking about how we're differentiating that information for all of our students.

370
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:29,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

371
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:35,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

372
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:38,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

373
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:40,873
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really excited to see this.

374
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:42,234
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we've talked about this a couple times.

375
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:44,655
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of questions I had.

376
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:52,818
[SPEAKER_13]: If somebody would like to participate on the curriculum review team, who do they reach out to?

377
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,081
[SPEAKER_13]: And how will the community that may not be watching the school committee meeting know to engage in this?

378
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:09,313
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to put together a wide range of communication and request people to submit their qualifications to be part of the committee.

379
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:10,794
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

380
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:23,800
[SPEAKER_13]: And does the HECAT require that the sexual health evaluation be evidence-based?

381
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:35,529
[SPEAKER_09]: In the materials that I have reviewed, and I'll also let Rachel speak to this, there's an overall comprehensive look at having them be evidence-based.

382
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:42,074
[SPEAKER_09]: And that comes up frequently in the documents that I've reviewed.

383
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:45,977
[SPEAKER_09]: And like you know, printed out, the HECAT is about this thick.

384
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:50,781
[SPEAKER_09]: It is extraordinarily comprehensive, so to say that we've reviewed all of it.

385
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:59,586
[SPEAKER_09]: would be a misnomer, but they do have several supporting documents that help to break it down, but I'll let Rachel add anything else.

386
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:05,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So the HECAT is based on the national standards, which is evidence-based and comprehensive.

387
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:18,921
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other question I had looking at the timeline, just thinking about the potential budget implications, if you all aren't formulating your responses or your recommendations,

388
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:31,030
[SPEAKER_13]: until the June timeframe, it sounds like there just may be a mismatch in terms of what we may or may not need from a budget standpoint.

389
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:37,175
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't know if you took that into consideration when you put the timeline together or if you could.

390
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:48,083
[SPEAKER_13]: And a couple of the things that I think about really specifically are from an implementation perspective, the middle school students who don't get health because they go to band.

391
00:36:49,605 --> 00:37:00,716
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, the need for health teach credentialed health teachers that we may or may not have in the district at all levels and how that fits into our staffing and our scheduling.

392
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:11,808
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just feel like there could be like a whole slew of implications from a budget perspective that we would want to be able to prioritize as quickly as possible, because I think this is long overdue.

393
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:18,798
[SPEAKER_13]: if we never show those crazy videos to the fifth graders, again, from Proctor and Gamble, it will be too soon for me.

394
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:24,720
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanna make sure that there's nothing at the end of this process that sort of delays our ability to implement.

395
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I do think, at least for me, this is a huge priority for the district.

396
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:34,662
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is, as you mentioned, like the last man standing around curriculum.

397
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:40,303
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we may not be willing to wait for the legislature, for DESE,

398
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:45,877
[SPEAKER_13]: for the legislature to step in and say, this has to be a priority for districts.

399
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:50,561
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think our kids need this information and this education.

400
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:55,966
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wanna make sure that whatever we can do to clear the path, that we're doing it proactively for you.

401
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:04,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I think that as we're going through this process, I kind of already know where the gaps are.

402
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:07,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as we're going through the process, I'll be able to report back

403
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,623
[SPEAKER_02]: before budget to say, this is what we might be needing.

404
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:14,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can kind of give you some kind of indication as to where we're at.

405
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:15,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

406
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:16,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

407
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kreatz?

408
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:20,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

409
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:21,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the presentation.

410
00:38:21,953 --> 00:38:24,055
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had a similar question that Ms.

411
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:27,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Graham had, was how do interested community members

412
00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:30,255
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, find out about opportunities and you've already answered it.

413
00:38:30,336 --> 00:38:30,936
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm all set.

414
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:33,197
[SPEAKER_11]: It was easy.

415
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:33,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

416
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:34,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

417
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:35,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

418
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Just what's the time commitment.

419
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:40,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it said it's two times a month that you guys plan on meeting.

420
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:41,962
[SPEAKER_03]: How long are those meetings going to be?

421
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:53,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that just given they're probably going to be about two hours long each, and then there's going to be an expectation for community members and members of this committee to do research to work in between.

422
00:38:54,818 --> 00:39:03,165
[SPEAKER_09]: As well There's no way that we would be able to conduct this meeting this body of work within just two hours Within four hours a month.

423
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:22,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say so myself and Rachel will also be doing a considerable amount of work to help support the committee, but The reality is is that I would say you're looking at four hours plus whatever time individuals need on their own to Do the pieces and the tasks that are necessary?

424
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:32,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And just lastly, I'm wondering if there's any sort of pediatrician or any role like that that you guys have considered for?

425
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:39,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that might fall under community health care providers.

426
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:41,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to make sure that I got the terminology.

427
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:43,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

428
00:39:44,127 --> 00:39:44,587
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, great.

429
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:44,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

430
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:47,670
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our student rep, Domenico, who has a question.

431
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:53,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, so as a vocational student, my schedule was limited enough that I can't have a health class.

432
00:39:54,125 --> 00:40:05,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any, are you guys gonna look into options for possibly revamping the online program or offering education to students who can't really fit into their schedules?

433
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:17,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I think after the HECAT, after we do the evaluation, we also do need to take a look at scheduling and maybe look at an online option for students that are in that same position.

434
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:34,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, it's a significant goal of the high school leadership and district leadership to take a comprehensive outside look at our schedule and to see the ways that we can really improve and move our high school schedule forward.

435
00:40:34,885 --> 00:40:45,947
[SPEAKER_09]: So that what I need to be clear about this, while everybody can't have everything, we need to do a better job at making sure that those priority elements are there.

436
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:50,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, that in high school scheduling, there are difficult choices that may have to be made.

437
00:40:51,679 --> 00:41:06,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that health should not be falling into the category of difficult choice, but we need a comprehensive examination of our high school schedule and some barriers to move out of the way to make sure that that can happen.

438
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:12,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And to piggyback on that, it was that I think member Graham announced it as well.

439
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,880
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have banned in the middle school, you can't take health.

440
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:31,669
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there any option for parents to use a curriculum at home or for students in high school or at the Boak to take any sort of health education or learn anything about what would be taught in health during the day?

441
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:41,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, I think once we evaluate this, we can come up with an online program that does meet all the standards, and we can provide that as well if our

442
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:43,522
[SPEAKER_02]: off schedule can't meet those needs.

443
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,583
[SPEAKER_05]: But nothing is offered can be off right now.

444
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:51,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

445
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:52,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident.

446
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:56,628
[SPEAKER_12]: I just name an address for the record, please.

447
00:41:57,388 --> 00:41:58,949
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, name address for the record.

448
00:41:59,089 --> 00:41:59,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sure.

449
00:41:59,689 --> 00:42:02,370
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Katie Adamak, and I live at 14 Walcott Street.

450
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:10,618
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a son in the sixth grade at the Angers Middle School, and I'm also a public health researcher.

451
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:16,483
[SPEAKER_12]: I study sexual reproductive health, and sexuality education is actually my career.

452
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:23,536
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is something that's kind of near and dear to my heart, and I'm really, really excited that you guys are taking a look at this.

453
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:29,099
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been underwhelmed by what I've heard about the sexuality education in Medford schools.

454
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,161
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say, I can't really speak to, like, larger health education as it is.

455
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:38,444
[SPEAKER_12]: I am really excited to hear that you guys are

456
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,860
[SPEAKER_12]: assessing curricula using the eCAT.

457
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,741
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the eCAT is an important tool.

458
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:50,684
[SPEAKER_12]: However, the curricula that you're assessing and selecting those curricula, I think in a lot of ways is more important.

459
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:56,466
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can run any curricula through the eCAT to see if it's an effective curricula.

460
00:42:57,947 --> 00:42:58,847
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, there's

461
00:43:01,523 --> 00:43:07,929
[SPEAKER_12]: and things in all these different curricula, like choosing an abstinence-based curricula definitely has a very certain message for the community.

462
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:14,776
[SPEAKER_12]: I definitely, as a researcher who's an expert in this field, very much do not recommend using an abstinence-based curricula.

463
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:16,157
[SPEAKER_12]: You should be using a comprehensive

464
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:26,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Our students deserve to learn about all sorts of different types of sexuality, things like healthy relationships, consent, birth control, all of that stuff.

465
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:33,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Abstinence is one piece of it, and it is an important piece of it, but it's very important to learn about these other things.

466
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:39,792
[SPEAKER_12]: So in terms of selecting sex ed curricula, I just wanted to let you know about several tools that are out there.

467
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:42,894
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Evidence Review.

468
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:49,299
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a reviewer on that project through HHS, Department of Health and Human Services.

469
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:56,665
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a rigorous methodology that we go through to select the programs that are actually listed on that list.

470
00:43:56,805 --> 00:43:59,668
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been on hiatus for five years through the previous

471
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:05,312
[SPEAKER_12]: presidential administration, they put it on hiatus, but this is the first year that the review is back.

472
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:14,337
[SPEAKER_12]: And so in March, we'll have a big release of new programs, but already there's 30 programs on the current list that you can select from.

473
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:15,818
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a perfect list.

474
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:19,260
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll say there are abstinence programs on that list.

475
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,722
[SPEAKER_12]: So not everything on there is necessarily medically accurate.

476
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:28,284
[SPEAKER_12]: It does have evidence of effectiveness for certain sexual behavior outcomes.

477
00:44:28,724 --> 00:44:30,085
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to get into like all the details,

478
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:39,426
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would love it if someone in Medford, I'm happy to help, would go through that list and help select curricula off of that.

479
00:44:40,186 --> 00:44:44,029
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you guys already have a curriculum in mind for sexuality education.

480
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,311
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one thing I was wondering.

481
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:58,859
[SPEAKER_12]: And also running, the HECAT's great, but for sex ed specifically, there's National Sexuality Education Standards, and they have their own assessment tool that I think is really important.

482
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,901
[SPEAKER_12]: especially if you guys only do this once every 30 years.

483
00:45:03,102 --> 00:45:05,242
[SPEAKER_12]: It might be worth the time.

484
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
[SPEAKER_12]: I realize time is limited.

485
00:45:07,803 --> 00:45:08,904
[SPEAKER_12]: But it is very concerning.

486
00:45:08,944 --> 00:45:15,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Massachusetts is one state that has no mandate for medically accurate sex ed, which is very, very concerning.

487
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:19,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though there are state health standards, sex ed, that is not a mandate.

488
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,690
[SPEAKER_12]: So you could really teach anything at Medford about sex to kids.

489
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,151
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hope we can be better than that and ensure that

490
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:32,315
[SPEAKER_12]: what we are teaching our kids is medically accurate, is evidence-based with strong rigorous evidence behind it.

491
00:45:32,776 --> 00:45:36,821
[SPEAKER_12]: People throw around the term evidence-based a lot, and a lot of curricula do as well.

492
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,824
[SPEAKER_12]: And sometimes that evidence is very, very thin.

493
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:42,469
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would ask that you like look through an evidence review.

494
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Blueprints is another one as well.

495
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:46,039
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, that's my two cents.

496
00:45:46,939 --> 00:45:47,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

497
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you happen to have four hours?

498
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:50,162
Yeah.

499
00:45:50,262 --> 00:45:51,283
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you so much.

500
00:45:51,363 --> 00:45:54,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, if you have any questions, Jenny knows how to get ahold of me, so share.

501
00:45:54,206 --> 00:45:57,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have four hours a month you could give us for a committee we're forming?

502
00:45:58,009 --> 00:45:58,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Potentially.

503
00:45:58,910 --> 00:45:59,511
OK.

504
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:02,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

505
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:05,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Katie for coming up and speaking.

506
00:46:05,865 --> 00:46:17,149
[SPEAKER_09]: It just, I think, as we move forward with the formation of this committee, we're going to be looking for members of the community who are going to be able to help push us and support us to bring the absolute best to the Metro students.

507
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:28,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I do also want to, I failed to mention, this connects to our strategic plan, the very first initiative to make sure that we're conducting comprehensive curriculum reviews of our curriculum.

508
00:46:28,733 --> 00:46:32,675
[SPEAKER_09]: So just wanted to make sure that that's known as it's connected to our strategic plan.

509
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:34,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

510
00:46:35,403 --> 00:46:35,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Good news.

511
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:36,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

512
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:37,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

513
00:46:38,886 --> 00:46:47,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, we have number four review of summer 2022 professional development and leadership training programs attended by the superintendent, Dr. Maurice Edward.

514
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:53,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

515
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:58,022
[SPEAKER_07]: So this past summer, I had the opportunity to

516
00:46:58,766 --> 00:47:16,798
[SPEAKER_07]: participate in different professional development sessions, both with MASS, Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, and with Leading Now, an additional professional development organization.

517
00:47:17,258 --> 00:47:28,025
[SPEAKER_07]: But tonight, I just wanna take this opportunity to share with the committee what it is that I'm doing thus far, and the work that I will continue to be working on over the course of this year.

518
00:47:34,204 --> 00:47:49,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the superintendent's professional development, my professional development is grounded on the premise that we want to, my goal is to promote district-wide coherence.

519
00:47:50,716 --> 00:47:53,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Coherence is very, very important.

520
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:59,883
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be defined as a systematic or logical connection or consistency.

521
00:48:00,908 --> 00:48:06,072
[SPEAKER_07]: and B, the integration of diverse elements, relationships, or values.

522
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:20,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do believe that through promoting coherence on a district-wide basis, all stakeholders will have similar experiences across the district, and it doesn't matter which homeschool is your base.

523
00:48:25,288 --> 00:48:29,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So the professional development that I'll be participating in

524
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:32,294
[SPEAKER_07]: is also connected to my core values.

525
00:48:33,815 --> 00:48:42,038
[SPEAKER_07]: When I came to Medford, I talked about ACE, achievement for all, collaboration for all, and equity for all.

526
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Achievement for all, believing that all students can learn and having high standards for all of our students.

527
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:54,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Collaboration, I truly believe in the power of the team.

528
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:58,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe in empowering colleagues who are leading the work,

529
00:48:59,721 --> 00:49:02,203
[SPEAKER_07]: The collective is greater than the individual.

530
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:04,584
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not one person who can do the job.

531
00:49:05,144 --> 00:49:06,565
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a team that does the job.

532
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:19,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe in leveraging the strength of the entire team to work toward our strengths so that we can deliver the best quality service to the district and to our students.

533
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:21,935
[SPEAKER_07]: E, equity for all.

534
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:28,039
[SPEAKER_07]: We are stronger because of our differences and we value all learners.

535
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:49,498
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to being connected to my personal core values, professional core values, the professional development that I'm participating in is also directly connected to the goals that I presented to the committee at our last session.

536
00:49:50,618 --> 00:49:58,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am zoning in specifically under the category umbrella of our district improvement goal.

537
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:07,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And so our district improvement goal talks about creating a culture that values consistent communication.

538
00:50:08,524 --> 00:50:13,386
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can move forward, bullet number three, which is consistent communication.

539
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:14,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

540
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Creating a culture that values consistent communication.

541
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:25,175
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a key action that was listed in the goals that were approved by this committee at our last session.

542
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:39,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, consistent communication to families across all schools and student services, such as, but not limited to athletics, counseling, career services, and student governance.

543
00:50:43,257 --> 00:50:52,519
[SPEAKER_07]: The slide that you're looking at right now is an excerpt from some of the training that I've been participating in with Leading Now, which is a national organization.

544
00:50:53,659 --> 00:51:09,582
[SPEAKER_07]: When I went to Denver over the summer, I met and worked with superintendents from East Coast, West Coast, all over Washington State, and it was truly an enriching experience.

545
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:30,914
[SPEAKER_07]: The Leading Now structure, how the cohorts are set up, they ask us to tackle real life scenarios and problems of practice, which may include, how do I shepherd a wide range of stakeholders to implement new policies?

546
00:51:33,188 --> 00:51:38,152
[SPEAKER_07]: How can we best use our resources to advance district priorities?

547
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:47,781
[SPEAKER_07]: The previous presentation that Dr. Cushing and Rachel Perry shared are directly linked to our strategic plan.

548
00:51:48,422 --> 00:51:58,671
[SPEAKER_07]: How are we leveraging our resources and the materials that we have available to, again, bring greater coherence and meet the needs of our school district?

549
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:16,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Thirdly, how can we work with board members, which also they use that school committee members, parents, political partners, and community groups in a constructive way that supports student learning.

550
00:52:16,598 --> 00:52:30,988
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, just the previous presentation gave an example of another opportunity where we're going to be welcoming many stakeholders to be part of an important conversation to bring about

551
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,088
[SPEAKER_07]: new and improved resources for our students in the area of health.

552
00:52:36,709 --> 00:52:42,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank our community member who is an expert who shared, you know, off the cuff what she is doing.

553
00:52:43,737 --> 00:53:06,569
[SPEAKER_07]: To the right on that slide, you can see the concentric circles showing all of the different stakeholder groups, parent and community members, cabinet, principals, teachers, staff, paraprofessionals, secretaries, everyone, students, and our school board, school committee.

554
00:53:07,649 --> 00:53:23,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of these stakeholders working together and the star in the middle, the superintendent trying to collaborate and coordinate all stakeholders again to strengthen and bring forth the best district possible.

555
00:53:25,755 --> 00:53:34,458
[SPEAKER_07]: The bottom three quotes I'm just gonna share with you are quotes from superintendents who participated in the training during the 21-22 school year.

556
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:42,852
[SPEAKER_07]: One shared, I haven't worked on my own professional growth since COVID.

557
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:44,752
[SPEAKER_07]: This was time well spent.

558
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:55,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I never opened my laptop the whole day we were together, staying focused and not being distracted by emails, which sometimes is hard to do or not to do.

559
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:58,876
[SPEAKER_07]: System leaders aren't afforded spaces like this enough.

560
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:04,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It is rare to have opportunities to be vulnerable and authentic.

561
00:54:05,345 --> 00:54:17,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Another superintendent that was quoted said, I am in two other professional development opportunities this year and leading now is the only one I will consistently prioritize.

562
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:20,034
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, there's lots of praise.

563
00:54:20,414 --> 00:54:31,561
[SPEAKER_07]: It creates great opportunities for collaboration and really having thought partners across the nation, which I look forward to that.

564
00:54:35,629 --> 00:54:56,664
[SPEAKER_07]: So a few key noticings that I do wanna share with the committee members that as we have restructured and I am out in the field, visiting the schools, meeting with principals and administrators and seeing what's happening just during these first few weeks of school.

565
00:54:57,565 --> 00:54:59,746
[SPEAKER_07]: These are some of the key things that I have noticed.

566
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:04,630
[SPEAKER_07]: All the schools are wonderfully welcoming and warm.

567
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:08,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Student engagement is active.

568
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:09,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Students are learning.

569
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Students are happy.

570
00:55:10,231 --> 00:55:13,514
[SPEAKER_07]: They are working with their peers.

571
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:23,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had the opportunity, and as I've been entering the buildings, to welcome new staff members who are brand new to Mustang Nation.

572
00:55:25,194 --> 00:55:28,257
[SPEAKER_07]: and just letting them know that I am happy that they have joined the team.

573
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:45,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And I haven't gotten to every single new staff person, but as I have been in buildings, depending sometimes they're on planning periods, but as I continue to do the rounds, I will be doing that with all principals to make sure that I get to welcome all new staff.

574
00:55:46,673 --> 00:56:08,022
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to that, teachers and staff have been working together to best position our students for a successful year and school administrators have been engaging with families at open house, whether it's open houses, curriculum nights, and many school-based events that have already taken place.

575
00:56:08,642 --> 00:56:15,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really do feel like the school year has gotten off to a very positive start for our community.

576
00:56:19,974 --> 00:56:31,165
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a few personal professional commitments that I have made knowing that I need to be flexible and nimble, nimble and flexible.

577
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:52,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I am determined to create additional opportunities such as coffee chats and meet and greets with families, staff, students, and stakeholders that is still being designed how it will roll out, but to roll it out throughout the entire district.

578
00:56:52,896 --> 00:56:53,837
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a commitment.

579
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:58,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Addition to that commitment, which was also mentioned added

580
00:56:58,871 --> 00:57:08,436
[SPEAKER_07]: to the revised goals was to make sure that we conduct the parent surveys and receive feedback so that we can continuously improve.

581
00:57:09,557 --> 00:57:16,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It is important to be able to get the feedback and look at areas where we can tweak and make the necessary adjustments.

582
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:19,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly,

583
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:33,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Participating in professional development, it's great being part of a professional learning community, also called PLCs, which we use sometimes that terminology in schools.

584
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:34,859
[SPEAKER_07]: We are always learning.

585
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:36,220
[SPEAKER_07]: We are in education.

586
00:57:37,361 --> 00:57:38,482
[SPEAKER_07]: It's critically important.

587
00:57:39,728 --> 00:57:53,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so excited that leading now, to be part of leading now, that leading now is part of my story of development for this year, the support, coaching, and professional development that I will continue to receive this year.

588
00:57:54,611 --> 00:58:11,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And also being part of a professional learning community, I just wanted to say to the entire committee that having a renewed commitment to strategic communications and public engagement, it's going to allow me to stay the course.

589
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:15,542
[SPEAKER_07]: on my commitment to all students in Medford.

590
00:58:16,283 --> 00:58:29,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So that this picture here, which was just taken last June, students happy, excited, right there at Hormel celebrating

591
00:58:30,885 --> 00:58:32,486
[SPEAKER_07]: their time in Medford Public Schools.

592
00:58:32,827 --> 00:58:46,519
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's my North Star, that's my goal, whether you go on to college or you go on to career, but getting all of our students to that finish line so that they can begin the next chapter of their lives.

593
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:48,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm open to any questions.

594
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:51,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

595
00:58:51,123 --> 00:58:55,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it was a few busy weeks for you during that time.

596
00:58:56,698 --> 00:58:57,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the update.

597
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:01,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Number five, we have update on Medford public schools, personnel and labor issues.

598
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:05,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Dave Murphy, assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

599
00:59:07,006 --> 00:59:07,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

600
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:12,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, mayor.

601
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:16,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Pleasure to be with you tonight.

602
00:59:17,898 --> 00:59:28,910
[SPEAKER_06]: As it says on the agenda, we'll be touching base with respect to both where we are with respect to our collective bargaining negotiations, which are ongoing, as well as where we are

603
00:59:30,211 --> 00:59:45,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just say very briefly on the personnel front to pick up where we left off at the, I believe, the September 12th meeting was the last personnel update, at which time there were, we estimated, 17 vacancies in the paraprofessional ranks.

604
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:50,106
[SPEAKER_06]: That number now is 12 as of this moment.

605
00:59:51,608 --> 00:59:55,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of our challenge on the personnel front is these numbers fluctuate.

606
00:59:55,434 --> 01:00:02,063
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it is my hope that tomorrow morning that number will still be 12, or at least moving in a downward direction.

607
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:06,893
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have additional interviews scheduled.

608
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:16,100
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the teaching – from a teaching position perspective, it's a little more complicated because of some long-term substitute situations.

609
01:00:16,201 --> 01:00:24,848
[SPEAKER_06]: But generally speaking, those numbers have stabilized over the last couple of weeks, so we feel pretty comfortable where we are on the personnel side.

610
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:31,453
[SPEAKER_06]: With respect to our collective bargaining negotiations, as the superintendent announced

611
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:40,204
[SPEAKER_06]: agreement last week with our paraprofessionals, as well as our Kids Corner staff bargaining unit.

612
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:48,528
[SPEAKER_06]: And with your vote this evening, as the mayor said at the beginning of the meeting, those agreements are now finalized.

613
01:00:48,748 --> 01:01:01,954
[SPEAKER_06]: And the district, and I know the union leadership as well, are happy and proud that we've been able to take a significant step forward with respect to pay equity for both of those two units.

614
01:01:03,428 --> 01:01:04,649
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where we are in those.

615
01:01:04,669 --> 01:01:12,172
[SPEAKER_06]: There's ongoing negotiations with our custodian and security monitor bargaining units.

616
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:20,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you know, and as we'll talk a little bit about tonight, our teaching negotiations are ongoing as well.

617
01:01:20,436 --> 01:01:27,980
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the update that was provided to you, this is a document that will be on our website, which will be

618
01:01:30,933 --> 01:01:39,660
[SPEAKER_06]: of the things that we need to update the community on on a regular basis, the pandemic and our protocols related to COVID come to mind as one.

619
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:52,429
[SPEAKER_06]: This will, all the documents related to the negotiations with the Medford Teachers Association will be in one place so people can access them easily.

620
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:58,514
[SPEAKER_06]: If we go to the next slide, you can see there that that's where we are in terms of all of our bargaining units.

621
01:02:00,185 --> 01:02:04,426
[SPEAKER_06]: We have not yet begun with cafeteria employees or administrators for two different reasons.

622
01:02:04,486 --> 01:02:09,348
[SPEAKER_06]: The cafeteria employees were on a different cycle than the other bargaining units, and so their contract just expired.

623
01:02:09,368 --> 01:02:15,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we've had some initial conversations with the SEIU representatives, but have not yet got to the table there.

624
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:26,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And then our administrators just elected a new bargaining representative, and so we were prohibited from engaging in those discussions up until this point, but I would anticipate that they will begin in the near future.

625
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:42,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the next slide is information that you've seen before, but we did want to provide a higher level of specificity in response to some of the questions that we've received based on the other updates.

626
01:02:42,116 --> 01:02:44,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll see that top table there.

627
01:02:44,978 --> 01:02:53,382
[SPEAKER_06]: That indicates the cost of living adjustments that were in the previous three MTA collective bargaining agreements.

628
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:59,485
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see from going back to the beginning part of the last decade, the wage was a 6.62.

629
01:03:00,605 --> 01:03:08,629
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the result of a split halfway through one of the bargaining years, and I believe a smaller percentage that was tacked on to the beginning of that cycle.

630
01:03:08,649 --> 01:03:15,552
[SPEAKER_06]: 6.5% had been consistent generally with a 2-2-2 and then a split in the final year of the contract.

631
01:03:16,052 --> 01:03:17,432
[SPEAKER_06]: for the previous two CBAs.

632
01:03:17,952 --> 01:03:38,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can see that the MTA's current proposal of exceeding 10% in the initial proposal, which as the union has said to you on several public occasions, has said publicly on several occasions, I should say, that the 18% initial proposal was grounded in a comparison with respect to inflation.

633
01:03:39,257 --> 01:03:41,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't go into the same level of detail

634
01:03:44,879 --> 01:03:58,891
[SPEAKER_06]: of a municipal capacity and why it's impossible for us as a municipality or as a school district to match the numbers of inflation, particularly in the current economic conditions.

635
01:03:58,991 --> 01:04:08,700
[SPEAKER_06]: But that explanation is detailed in a pretty high level of specificity for September 12th, in our September

636
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,500
[SPEAKER_06]: about the communication.

637
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:24,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So for members of the community that are trying to sort of get up to speed as to where we are with respect to those negotiations, I would encourage you to refer to the first slide here, which provides all the previous documentation that we've discussed in this forum.

638
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:39,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Our analysis of the surrounding communities and other negotiations throughout the Commonwealth, and a lot of them are ongoing, some of them start at different points, so it's sort of impossible to put a very firm number on it.

639
01:04:39,974 --> 01:04:42,356
[SPEAKER_06]: But generally speaking, we're seeing about 7%, so a little

640
01:04:43,957 --> 01:05:00,738
[SPEAKER_06]: a little over what we've been able to provide in Medford historically, and in order to maintain competitiveness, while also always having fidelity to our sustainability responsibilities, our current offer and the offer that

641
01:05:01,919 --> 01:05:08,905
[SPEAKER_06]: was on the table at the time of the impasse declaration and continues to be on the table.

642
01:05:08,945 --> 01:05:21,436
[SPEAKER_06]: The 7.25%, which does not include the $1,000 per year per teacher money that we are offering as a result of the COVID-related grants.

643
01:05:21,677 --> 01:05:27,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the temporary funding that the district has access to for a short period of time coming out of the pandemic.

644
01:05:28,522 --> 01:05:36,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I've spelled out for you in the past the administration's rationale as to why we believe this is an appropriate and prudent use of those resources.

645
01:05:38,085 --> 01:05:41,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say that it is a considerable use of those resources.

646
01:05:41,306 --> 01:05:52,670
[SPEAKER_06]: So to invest $1,000 per employee per year in non-based compensation in this instance amounts to in the vicinity of $1.5 million.

647
01:05:55,791 --> 01:06:05,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think the administration has will continue to try to maintain as professional and respectful dialogue with our bargaining partners as possible.

648
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:18,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be remiss if I didn't say that for the MTA president to say that that money quote does not count when speaking before the Medford City Council recently was disappointing.

649
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:34,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's challenging from a discourse perspective, because whether it's grant money or operating money, when the district expends $1.5 million of money that can go toward a variety of causes, not any, it's not,

650
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:42,590
[SPEAKER_06]: an infinite number of causes that we can put that money toward, but certainly there's plenty of things that we can do to have a direct impact on students.

651
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:57,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I do think that all stakeholders have a responsibility to be cognizant of that and of the implications of that type of multimillion dollar investment that again, the district has put on the table and would like to make.

652
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,402
[SPEAKER_06]: With that money, it would bring

653
01:07:02,802 --> 01:07:13,627
[SPEAKER_06]: immediate payment to members of the teacher's bargaining unit to over 9% in compensation during the life of the contract.

654
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:18,590
[SPEAKER_06]: As has been stated, and as is true, that is not entirely based compensation.

655
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:31,416
[SPEAKER_06]: But the correlation here is that it is money that we're able to provide our current teachers who have worked through some very, very difficult and challenging circumstances

656
01:07:32,236 --> 01:07:41,521
[SPEAKER_06]: and as we've said in this forum before, who are continuing to work through very difficult and challenging circumstances as we move through the pandemic.

657
01:07:43,262 --> 01:07:45,464
[SPEAKER_06]: That is something that we have available to us.

658
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:58,851
[SPEAKER_06]: We're grateful to have that option available to us as a result of the federal legislation and the state allocation to the city of Medford and to the Medford public schools, but it's not funding we have available to us in perpetuity.

659
01:07:59,811 --> 01:08:18,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And so to expend that funding via base pay increases, which in fact do last in perpetuity, would create a structural financial deficit that would force us to reduce positions in the future.

660
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:21,055
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is inevitable

661
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:32,492
[SPEAKER_06]: that the positions that we would have to look at reducing are some of the additional supports that we've been able to bring in to support some of our most vulnerable students.

662
01:08:33,153 --> 01:08:45,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think right now we're in a situation, not so much tonight, but frequently this conversation is unfolding with a tremendous amount of noise.

663
01:08:46,342 --> 01:08:50,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my experience, conducting a negotiation

664
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:55,160
[SPEAKER_06]: with a high level of noise is challenging.

665
01:08:56,041 --> 01:09:05,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think what I find most constructive is to take a step back and try to look at the question in as simple a manner as possible.

666
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:09,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And in this instance, really there are two questions.

667
01:09:10,033 --> 01:09:16,098
[SPEAKER_06]: One is what we're offering responsible, meaning is it sustainable?

668
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And two, is it competitive?

669
01:09:20,453 --> 01:09:27,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are answering that question based on the point of comparisons that we have available to us.

670
01:09:28,523 --> 01:09:39,055
[SPEAKER_06]: So in comparison to what we've always offered historically, both with respect to base pay and additional compensation, this number significantly exceeds what we've done.

671
01:09:40,151 --> 01:09:42,373
[SPEAKER_06]: with respect to what's happening in other communities.

672
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:45,455
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not saying there aren't outliers, because of course there always are.

673
01:09:46,135 --> 01:09:52,160
[SPEAKER_06]: But generally speaking, this is very competitive when looked at through that lens from a market perspective.

674
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think finally, just in terms of the numbers that are on here,

675
01:09:56,543 --> 01:10:13,337
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think most of us who work in this field, or frankly anyone who's ever had the opportunity to benefit from a teacher that influences them or opens doors for them, we know that our median salary of $86,000 is nowhere close to as high as we'd like it to be.

676
01:10:14,226 --> 01:10:36,598
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's very rare that you are in a sphere of public education where the people that are doing this day in and day out, whether they're an administrator or a teacher or anything else, frankly, an elected official, very few of us think that having an average salary of $85,000, $86,000 is somehow commensurate with the impact that teachers can have.

677
01:10:36,798 --> 01:10:37,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, and it's never been.

678
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:42,521
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a different question as to whether it is competitive.

679
01:10:43,201 --> 01:11:01,517
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the analysis that the district has done and looking in this market in this region, our current median salary of $86,000 and our projected median salary just next year if what we've proposed were to go into effect of $93,000 is competitive.

680
01:11:04,884 --> 01:11:18,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't argue that it's enough, and I don't think the person, me or anyone else in this type of role is ever going to argue that it's enough, because the more competitive we can be, the better off this district is going to be and the better off the students of Bedford are going to be.

681
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:32,211
[SPEAKER_06]: If we act in an irresponsible manner, and if we institute pay increases that are beyond what we can sustain, it is inevitable that it will have a negative impact on students.

682
01:11:32,771 --> 01:11:36,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that is why we've taken the positions that we have.

683
01:11:36,715 --> 01:11:42,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And with respect to why those positions are being now discussed publicly,

684
01:11:44,505 --> 01:12:06,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say it's because we as an administration essentially ran out of options at the table, which is why we sought – we are seeking a neutral mediator from the state to help us to break the stalemate and try to get back to a place where the contract can be resolved, the individual members of the teachers union who now

685
01:12:09,634 --> 01:12:22,648
[SPEAKER_06]: but on average $4,400 waiting for them once this contract is resolved because if you factor in the retroactive payments and the one-time payments that the moment are still on the table from the district it's a significant payout

686
01:12:24,562 --> 01:12:38,386
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's a need to, we believe as the district, to move past this and start getting back to the work of running the district with the necessary collaboration with each of our bargaining partners.

687
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:41,507
[SPEAKER_06]: We are eager to do that.

688
01:12:41,907 --> 01:12:45,468
[SPEAKER_06]: We think doing that is an urgent priority.

689
01:12:46,109 --> 01:12:53,051
[SPEAKER_06]: But to get to that point recklessly, which is what a 10% increase

690
01:12:54,492 --> 01:12:58,335
[SPEAKER_06]: would do, which is what's been on the table, that that's not something we can do.

691
01:12:59,796 --> 01:13:01,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to go to the next slide.

692
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:05,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, this is somewhat of a recap from last time, and I've kind of covered it already this evening.

693
01:13:06,301 --> 01:13:15,748
[SPEAKER_06]: When the MTA presented on June 6th, they estimated that our operating budget could sustain a 2.25% increase.

694
01:13:16,869 --> 01:13:19,331
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not something that the district has a strong disagreement with.

695
01:13:19,371 --> 01:13:22,534
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about accurate with respect to what our budgetary capacity is.

696
01:13:23,234 --> 01:13:41,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Our disagreement really comes down to what was presented on June 6th, which is that we should use the temporary grant funding to inflate the base pay in a way that there is no specific plan, a reliable plan to fund beyond next year.

697
01:13:42,688 --> 01:13:46,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And while this, again, there's a lot of noise, there's a lot of back and forth,

698
01:13:48,246 --> 01:13:58,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm disappointed by some of what's been communicated, particularly in recent days, particularly in a negotiation that there aren't any other issues that we know of, at least that are on the table.

699
01:14:07,797 --> 01:14:10,659
[SPEAKER_06]: identical language or actually had signed tentative agreements on.

700
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:16,584
[SPEAKER_06]: So the issues are relatively narrow, but that means that our options are relatively narrow as well.

701
01:14:17,325 --> 01:14:22,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's our hope that we will be able to have a resolution as quickly as possible.

702
01:14:23,611 --> 01:14:24,612
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a timeline.

703
01:14:24,912 --> 01:14:38,848
[SPEAKER_06]: This goes back to when the initial conversations in the summer of 2021 and the negotiations beginning at the union's request in November of 2021 and then a summary just with respect to

704
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,289
[SPEAKER_06]: where we go from here.

705
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:51,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess one development since our September 12th presentation to you, the MTA did file an objection to our request for mediation.

706
01:14:51,233 --> 01:14:56,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So to be clear, again, for those maybe watching or listening to this for the first time,

707
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:13,077
[SPEAKER_06]: After 10 months and close to 20 bargaining sessions and after the issues were narrowed to this question over the compensation increase, the superintendent recommended and the school committee voted to approve an impasse declaration.

708
01:15:13,818 --> 01:15:16,822
[SPEAKER_06]: By doing so, we're able to request a neutral mediator.

709
01:15:17,563 --> 01:15:21,586
[SPEAKER_06]: to help support the negotiations and work with both parties to try to come to a resolution.

710
01:15:22,427 --> 01:15:31,434
[SPEAKER_06]: What was communicated on September 12th to you by representatives of the MTA was there was disappointment that in the belief that that would somehow delay the process.

711
01:15:32,635 --> 01:15:36,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Having lived through this with DLR a few times before I will tell you that had the objection not

712
01:15:38,376 --> 01:15:43,697
[SPEAKER_06]: been filed by the M. T. A. We would already have a mediator and we would be in mediation right now.

713
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:50,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it's it's my hope that, uh, one way or another that will that will happen soon.

714
01:15:50,419 --> 01:15:55,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, as I said, it's really not in anyone's interest for this to go on indefinitely.

715
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,361
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're hopeful toe to be able to reach an amicable resolution in the near future.

716
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:02,382
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.

717
01:16:04,782 --> 01:16:05,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

718
01:16:06,543 --> 01:16:07,403
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate the update.

719
01:16:07,683 --> 01:16:07,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

720
01:16:11,516 --> 01:16:16,158
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not have any continued business or new business or reports requested.

721
01:16:16,298 --> 01:16:19,099
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving on to number 10, our condolences.

722
01:16:19,759 --> 01:16:34,085
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of former city councilor, William A. Carr Sr., a former English teacher at the former Lincoln Junior High School and former guidance director at Medford High School.

723
01:16:35,105 --> 01:16:39,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Teresa,

724
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:49,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Piso Caraviello, age 90, a lifetime resident of Medford and mother of Joanne Mortel, benefits coordinator in the business center.

725
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,088
[SPEAKER_05]: If we take a moment of silence.

726
01:17:08,428 --> 01:17:11,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next meeting will be on Monday, October 17th.

727
01:17:12,012 --> 01:17:16,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Regular school committee meeting here in the Allman Memorial Chambers as well as on Zoom.

728
01:17:17,118 --> 01:17:19,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope everybody has a great rest of the week.

729
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:21,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

730
01:17:23,345 --> 01:17:24,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn.

731
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:25,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

732
01:17:25,427 --> 01:17:26,228
