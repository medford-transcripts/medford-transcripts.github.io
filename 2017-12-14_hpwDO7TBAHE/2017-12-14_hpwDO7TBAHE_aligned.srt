1
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:06,923
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:11,246
37th regular meeting of the Memphis City Council, November 28th, 2017.

3
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:14,247
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

4
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:17,269
Councilor DelaRusso?

5
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:18,570
Present.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,471
Councilor Falco?

7
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:20,471
Present.

8
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:21,092
Councilor Night?

9
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:21,612
Present.

10
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:22,993
Councilor McKernan?

11
00:00:23,013 --> 00:00:23,073
Yes.

12
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:25,614
Vice President Marks?

13
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:26,595
Present.

14
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,096
Councilor Scott Kelly?

15
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:28,436
Present.

16
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:30,117
President Caviello?

17
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:30,978
Present.

18
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,226
Please rise and salute the flag.

19
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:45,712
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:49,935
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

21
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:53,958
Councilor Del Rosso.

22
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:58,183
Before we begin, may I just make one brief indication here?

23
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:04,590
Due to the intervention of this Medford City Council, the comment period was extended.

24
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:19,485
with the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs regarding the Green Line extension notice of project change.

25
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:24,247
And so there is an additional couple weeks people have.

26
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:30,030
They should check out the resources and to their new deadline.

27
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:46,833
and their comments for the environmental impact on the Green Line extension to the parkway may be sent to the MEPA office, EEA number 13886, 100 Cambridge Street, Suite 900, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114.

28
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:50,874
Thank you, Councilor Del Rosso.

29
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:58,155
If the messenger could make a few copies of this to hand out to maybe some people in the audience, it would be appreciated.

30
00:02:00,994 --> 00:02:02,294
Thank you, Councilor DelaRosso.

31
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:07,936
And that'll also be posted on the website.

32
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:11,777
Did you want to make a comment?

33
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:14,277
Name and address for the record, please.

34
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:15,838
Hold on one second.

35
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:18,318
Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street, Miffitt.

36
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:24,140
I spoke before the council last week about this issue about the non-notification and

37
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:30,039
Okay.

38
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:40,003
Okay, about the non-notification, and because of the intercession of the council, we got the deadline pushed back to December 12th.

39
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:44,405
However, I have one other question.

40
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:51,448
You know, I mentioned last week that I knocked on 150 doors to inform people about the meeting that didn't know about it.

41
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:58,053
So now, those 150 people don't know about the extension of the deadline for the comments.

42
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:07,057
So, it is a long address, and Councilor De La Ruza just read it off, but I was wondering if you people had any suggestions on how you could get that.

43
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:09,177
It will be on the city website also.

44
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:12,479
Yeah, but people need to know to go there.

45
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:18,261
You see, people don't know that the deadline has been extended, so.

46
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,862
Point of information, Councilor Longo-Curran.

47
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:35,410
I think maybe we could do a reverse 911 call to go out, request to go out tomorrow or the next day to notify people that there is the extension, where to send the letters, and also go on the city website if you want more information.

48
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,472
Right, that might be, I was thinking of that also.

49
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:44,437
You could probably, on the government access channel where you post the street sweeping session, you could probably post a notice there as well.

50
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,759
I think that would be a good idea if you could do that.

51
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:51,580
And going forward, and a newspaper notice.

52
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,741
I don't know if the T or the city is planning on any kind of newspaper notice.

53
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:57,922
We'll have to see about that.

54
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:03,623
But going forward, I appreciate the efforts that the council made on behalf of the residents.

55
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:14,226
And I urge you all to please stay involved with this project because it's been a long drawn out thing and advocate for resident involvements.

56
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:29,778
The city, I think, down the road, needs to have a dedicated meeting for our butters and those directly affected in the neighborhoods that are adjacent to the track, because there are a lot of new people who have moved in.

57
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:35,683
This project has been going on for 12 years, and those new people who have come in the neighborhood, some of them don't even know what this is all about.

58
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:51,631
So I think, I think the city should try to get those abutters together and bring them up to date of what's going on, what the future is, what the city has planned, if there's economic development, where it is, who it's going to involve and so forth.

59
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:56,593
Um, and my, my office stands that I gave you people last week.

60
00:04:56,693 --> 00:05:01,375
I'd be glad to lead a walking tour through the neighborhoods for both the council and the mayor.

61
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:03,913
because a picture is worth a thousand words.

62
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:09,315
If you can see what it is we're talking about, you have a better appreciation of what's going on.

63
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,477
So thank you for your time and thank you for your advocacy.

64
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:16,799
And, um, you know, you may see me again if we have another issue.

65
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,199
Thank you very much.

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,780
Thank you.

67
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,963
If I may, through the chair, I just want to thank, um, the speaker and all those that spoke last week, there was about five people here.

68
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:31,530
advocating for the extension of the common period and their ability to get notification.

69
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,771
I think that's important and they're doing it for hundreds of people in that neighborhood.

70
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:50,297
So I would just ask that we take a roll call vote, that a reverse 911 call go out tomorrow, notifying not only everybody in that neighborhood, but the entire city that there's a common period has been extended, the date, list the date and the address.

71
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:51,777
Thank you.

72
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,598
On the motion by Council Member Kern.

73
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:56,813
Councilor DelaRusso.

74
00:05:57,053 --> 00:06:09,439
That the city administration notify the project manager to increase mailing in the Butters neighborhoods.

75
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,743
On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kern as amended by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Falco.

76
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:17,643
All those in favor?

77
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:18,043
Aye.

78
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:21,645
Motion passes.

79
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:25,167
17-778, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved

80
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:33,636
that the MBTA install a bus shelter at the bus stop on South Porter Road at Roosevelt Circle Rotary in the interest of public safety.

81
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:34,717
Vice President Mox.

82
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:42,659
Mr. President, I know on the agenda also Councilor Scott Pelly has a similar paper if you'd like to read that also.

83
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,321
Let's see.

84
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:55,083
1779, offered by Councilor Scott Pelly, being resolved that the city administration reach out to the MBTA to inquire about placing a bus shelter at the bus stop

85
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:58,666
located at South Border Road in Roosevelt Circle.

86
00:06:59,346 --> 00:07:01,147
Vice President Mox, continue.

87
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:02,208
Thank you, Mr. President.

88
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:08,292
And I was recently contacted by a resident that happens to take that bus.

89
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:18,398
If anyone's familiar, this bus stop is located on South Border Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Circle,

90
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:28,662
If you're not familiar with it, it's the picnic bench that's been out there for some time now that is considered the bus stop.

91
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:36,565
And this particular resident contacted me, said not only is this bus stop kind of in a bad area,

92
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:45,122
being placed around the rotary at Roosevelt Circle, which is a highly traveled and fast-paced area.

93
00:07:45,622 --> 00:08:02,270
But the fact that there's a picnic bench there does not lend itself to public transportation and or discourages people from using that as a legit bus shelter stop.

94
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,552
And this particular location would be a prime location

95
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:11,219
for a bus shelter to protect residents that use that.

96
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:24,270
I believe the 325 and the 100 bus both go by that location, and it would protect residents and commuters from the rain and snow and the inclement weather.

97
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,054
It also, Mr. President, in my opinion, would increase ridership at that particular location.

98
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:33,397
And Rep Donato reached out to me just recently

99
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:43,161
and said he's been working with some of the residents in that particular area that contacted his office to erect a bus shelter.

100
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:47,142
And the MBTA told them they do a ridership count.

101
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,823
And they recently performed one.

102
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:54,054
and said roughly 28 people use that particular bus stop.

103
00:08:54,815 --> 00:09:01,441
And the MBTA will not consider a bus shelter unless it's 50 or more people that use it.

104
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:17,595
But what I think, Mr. President, is the old issue that you have a shelter or a bus stop that's located in really a poor area in regards to traffic flow and so forth.

105
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:19,943
and safety of commuters.

106
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:26,606
And it also discourages people from standing there waiting to catch the bus.

107
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:44,635
So hence why the numbers of ridership may be down based on that current location, based on the fact that there's not a shelter that makes it look like, hey, this is a legit bus stop, rather than you're out there having a picnic off of 93 at a picnic bench.

108
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:47,336
So I would ask, Mr. President, that

109
00:09:48,110 --> 00:10:07,769
this council send a request to the MBTA to erect a bus shelter at South Border Road at the intersection of Roosevelt Rotary in the interest of public safety, which services riders on the 325 and 100 bus, Mr. President.

110
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:11,653
We may also have a resident here, I don't know if Barney's here tonight,

111
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:13,616
She said she was going to come.

112
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:18,500
And if we can also listen to Bonnie, who wants to speak on the issue, Mr. President.

113
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,061
Thank you.

114
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,121
Councilor Scott Belli.

115
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,804
Thank you, Councilor.

116
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:28,008
Mr. President, Councilor Moxley, reiterating what I don't want to be redundant.

117
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,510
You brought up the same points.

118
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,192
I think that in today's

119
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:41,187
Studies have shown that we want more people off the street and out of cars.

120
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:49,333
And when we're prohibiting people or welcoming people to their nearest bus stop, I think that's exactly what we're doing.

121
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,915
We're limiting them from using public transportation.

122
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:58,080
So I second the resolve from Council Marks and

123
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:04,545
I'd like to put a timeline to that, that we get a response back within two weeks if we can.

124
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:25,030
And if not, I want to send this to subcommittee and ask, I want to give it to the timeline, give it a few weeks, and then what I'd like to do if we don't have the proper response, I'd like to hold a subcommittee meeting with the representative from the T. If that doesn't, if we don't get

125
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:32,018
information back, because we know the lack of communications from the MBTA has been with this body.

126
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,522
So I think that we need to hold their feet to the fire.

127
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:41,289
And when you talk about that one area, it's a dangerous area.

128
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:44,012
And to put a picnic bench out there, it

129
00:11:47,548 --> 00:12:02,601
It's disheartening when you talk to some of those neighbors that see what might happen, what goes on in that area on a negative note when they are waiting in between buses.

130
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:14,751
So I second the resolve from Council Marks and amend it to see if we can put that within two weeks if we can.

131
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,971
an answer back within two weeks.

132
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:18,391
Thank you.

133
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:18,831
Thank you.

134
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,172
Councilor Falco.

135
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:21,113
Thank you, Mr. President.

136
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:25,355
I was also contacted by Bonnie as well, and I thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.

137
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:31,378
This is a very important issue, and we should always be encouraging people to take public transportation.

138
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:39,383
And I think that this, doing this, I think does encourage people to look at taking the bus.

139
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:45,206
I, myself, I've been taking the 325 for probably close to 20 years now, and I've been taking the

140
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:46,835
for a long time.

141
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:53,818
And I don't get on at that stop, but I do have friends that actually get on the bus at that stop.

142
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:57,839
And I had talked to many of them today that they do get on at that location.

143
00:12:57,939 --> 00:12:59,760
And it is a concern.

144
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,261
That can be a very dangerous stop.

145
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,642
It's right at the rotary and an off ramp.

146
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:11,244
And especially during the inclement weather, traffic can be pretty erratic on a good day.

147
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,685
But I think on a bad day,

148
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:13,798
it gets even worse.

149
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:17,299
So I think some sort of a bus shelter in that area would benefit everyone.

150
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,460
So I definitely support this resolution, and I thank my colleagues for bringing it forward.

151
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:22,920
Thank you.

152
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,600
Council Member O'Karen.

153
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,320
Thank you.

154
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,901
President Carviello, I just want to thank my colleagues also for bringing this forward.

155
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:32,041
It is a concerning spot.

156
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:36,402
There is nothing at that location to shield anybody from any elements.

157
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:40,823
I think the location of it definitely discourages residents that live

158
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:47,153
in the Lawrence Estates and those who would use that transportation spot, I think it definitely deters.

159
00:13:48,274 --> 00:14:01,807
The use in a bus shelter would go such a long way and I think it would encourage many, many more residents in this community to stop using their cars, to drive into Wellington Park and take the T and definitely use the bus.

160
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:05,571
I think it's definitely needed and I agree with giving a few weeks to

161
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,695
at least get some sort of response and seeing what we can do as a community.

162
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:16,040
Hopefully the mayor can get on board trying to push the MBTA with us to create a shelter there.

163
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,723
I think it's extremely important and I agree wholeheartedly.

164
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:19,803
So I second the approval.

165
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:20,604
Thank you.

166
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:21,865
Councilor Knight.

167
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:23,527
Mr. President, thank you very much.

168
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:28,251
I think we're all in agreement that we understand and value the importance of a bus shelter, especially at this location.

169
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:31,233
And the task that's before us here is how are we going to get it put there?

170
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:39,186
I'd like to amend the paper and also have it sent to the administration, Mr. President.

171
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:47,092
And I'd like to ask the administration to discuss mitigation strategies in relation to the number of mass DOT projects that are going on in the community to help fund this.

172
00:14:48,745 --> 00:14:52,108
some impact going on with the erection of the cell phone towers.

173
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:55,070
We have some impact going on with the extension of the Green Line.

174
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,235
We have some impact going on with the development of the Craddock Bridge that are all under MassDOT control, Mr. President.

175
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:05,159
And it's not unusual when projects are going on in communities that mitigation of this sort is extended.

176
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:15,668
So I'd also like to ask that the paper be sent to the administration with the request that they discuss mitigation with the MassDOT to provide funding or construction of such.

177
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:17,081
Thank you.

178
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:23,287
On the motion by Vice President Mox and Councilor Scott Pelley.

179
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:25,529
All those in favor?

180
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,391
I'm sorry?

181
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:31,575
Do we have someone that wants to speak?

182
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:32,936
Oh, I'm sorry.

183
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:34,357
I can't.

184
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:35,719
We couldn't see the process.

185
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,938
Hi, my name is Bonnie Steyer.

186
00:15:37,998 --> 00:15:42,519
I live at 35 Roosevelt Road, just a couple blocks away from this bus shelter.

187
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:49,981
Thank you, council members, for your prompt and considerable response to my concern about this bus shelter.

188
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:55,702
I do believe that it would be really helpful to have a bus shelter there.

189
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,823
I think it would increase the ridership.

190
00:15:58,844 --> 00:16:07,930
I think this bus stop, well the bus, the 325 and the 100 bus are wonderful ways to get into Boston on a daily basis.

191
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,674
And I think that more riders would be encouraged to take it if there was a shelter there in place.

192
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:16,056
Again, like you mentioned earlier,

193
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:31,095
It's very busy there and now that I'm leaving in the morning when it's, you know, the sun was rising at 6.50, being there in the dark is not a very great place to be with all those cars moving during the rush hour time.

194
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:41,237
So I appreciate all of your assistance and I'd be more than willing to help out with getting signatures or petition should the MBT need something like that.

195
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:42,678
So thank you again.

196
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:43,778
Thank you.

197
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:49,371
On the motion by Vice President Mox and Councilor Scott Pellitt.

198
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:51,893
Vice President Mox.

199
00:16:52,693 --> 00:17:06,541
Just if I could, and I've brought up this fact a number of times, the MBTA assesses this city, the city of Meffitt, over I believe it's $3 million a year to operate the MBTA in this community.

200
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:09,203
And we all pay for it as riders.

201
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:12,045
We pay through the sales tax.

202
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:14,046
There's a percent that goes towards

203
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:17,975
the operation of transit in this state.

204
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:26,722
And I think, Mr. President, I believe we're in the top maybe five or six in assessment in this state from the MBTA.

205
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:28,923
That money comes right off our cherry sheet.

206
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:32,366
So it's money that goes right out of this city coffers.

207
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:35,349
And it's based on services they're providing.

208
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:52,914
And I would state, Mr. President, that we need to take a long, hard look at many of our bus stops, many of the shelters that do exist in the city, the creation of not just this shelter, but many other shelters in prime locations.

209
00:17:53,574 --> 00:18:01,796
In the square, you have bus stops that hundreds of residents wait on a daily basis to take the bus there, and there's no shelters.

210
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:04,977
You know, I think the T has to do a better job

211
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:14,576
Mr. President, in this community, and I'm hoping, like Councilor Scott Pelley, that we get a quick response to this issue.

212
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:25,001
And also, Mr. President, based on the fact that we're one of a few communities that are paying such a heavy fee to have bus transportation, which is great.

213
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:26,362
I, like John Falco,

214
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:28,339
take the bus every day also.

215
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:35,843
But I can tell you, Mr. President, the access that we get in this community is not just for Method residents.

216
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:48,069
We're paying a hefty fee to make sure people from all surrounding communities that jump on our express bus and all the other transit methods that we have, we're paying for their ridership as well, Mr. President.

217
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:55,233
And I think, really, we need to make sure that the MBTA sees fit to make sure this community is getting its fair share.

218
00:18:56,073 --> 00:18:56,913
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

219
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:57,514
Counselor Knight.

220
00:18:57,954 --> 00:18:58,454
Mr. President.

221
00:18:58,474 --> 00:18:58,674
Yes.

222
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:02,677
Also where the MBTA is a quasi public agency underneath the mass dot umbrella.

223
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:06,959
I think it will be appropriate to amend the paper further and ask that this also be sent to a state delegation.

224
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,800
So they're aware of the request that the council's making.

225
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:10,041
Thank you.

226
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:18,846
On the motion by vice president mocks and counselor Scott Pelley as amended by counselor night.

227
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:21,537
seconded by Councilor Falco.

228
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:22,518
Roll call vote, Mr. President.

229
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:25,120
Roll call vote has been requested.

230
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,861
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

231
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:35,808
They're both together, 1779 and 1778, as amended by Councilor Knight.

232
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:59,079
Councilor DelaRusso?

233
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,500
Yes.

234
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,820
Councilor Falco?

235
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,101
Yes.

236
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:02,241
Councilor Night?

237
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:02,721
Yes.

238
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:04,002
Councilor Lockern?

239
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:04,202
Yes.

240
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:05,603
Vice President March?

241
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:05,883
Yes.

242
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,484
Councilor Scarpelli?

243
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:07,864
Yes.

244
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:08,945
President Caviello?

245
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:09,425
Yes.

246
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:15,708
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

247
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:26,334
17-780 offered by Councilor Lockern, be it resolved that the administration, through the Energy and Environment Office, develop a database and start an opt-out list for those who want to opt out

248
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:31,388
of any potentially implemented community aggregation plans.

249
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:32,969
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

250
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,249
Thank you, President Carviello.

251
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:40,911
I think the council in the last year or so has learned a great deal about community aggregation.

252
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:53,714
We've had a number of meetings relating to it, and we also have had a very informative meeting back, I believe, in September with the Energy Environment Director in Melrose, which I think

253
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:59,509
personally, for me, helped answer a lot of my questions.

254
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,612
And it was great to see another community and how the plan is succeeding.

255
00:21:03,632 --> 00:21:15,781
I think one concern I do have is just Medford's ability to notify people of their rights and the ability to opt out.

256
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:22,106
And when I do get emails or phone calls or people stop me in the street to talk about community aggregation, 80% want to

257
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:27,726
move forward with it and implement it in the city of Medford.

258
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:51,333
But there are some, a good 20% if I, just going off the people that contact me, there are people that don't want government telling them what to do, what plan to go into, and they too are concerned that this 30-day opt-out, when it does become available, if potentially the council is to vote for it, there's just many concerns.

259
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:54,034
They want to make sure that that opt-out plan is

260
00:21:54,738 --> 00:22:00,839
well publicized, and people know how to do it, and where to go, and who to talk to, who to ask questions to.

261
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:04,740
And one resident brought this up to me, and we discussed it in depth.

262
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:21,163
What if an opt-out plan was implemented, just even a database, a list of people that would relieve some of the 20% that I'm calculating from the people that I talk to, relieve them of their fears, and let them know that, no, we're not going to hide the fact that you can opt out.

263
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:26,595
If you want to, you can do it now just in case something is implemented.

264
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:33,359
I know it's a reach, but it's something that was requested by a resident, and I don't think it's a bad idea.

265
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:38,281
I think the community aggregation is something that we're going to talk about within the next several months.

266
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,323
And we just need to be ready on all accounts.

267
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:42,964
So I move this forward.

268
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:45,425
I think it's definitely something worth exploring.

269
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:46,526
It's simple.

270
00:22:46,606 --> 00:22:48,226
It's just a database.

271
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:50,888
It can be an Excel spreadsheet of people that want to be

272
00:22:52,030 --> 00:23:13,896
listed as not being involved in this community aggregation from the get-go, and it would give a peace of mind to those who are not interested, and maybe it would help us get the votes, maybe unanimous, maybe not, but it would get votes to implement the plan, which I know a large percentage of Medford wants to work on and work towards.

273
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:15,156
Thank you.

274
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:16,837
Councilor Scott Pelli.

275
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,090
Thank you, Mr. President.

276
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,951
Uh, thank my colleague for bringing this forward.

277
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:42,335
I know that, uh, months and months and months ago when we first were presented, I was one of the councils that voted against it because of, uh, the lack of, uh, information that went out to our constituencies, to our community and with the opt out because I'm, uh, in discussion with, with neighbors where, where neighbors that, uh,

278
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:52,054
that have been very conscious about purchasing their own energy and they're valid in understanding what the situation was.

279
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:59,402
And when I did my homework in visiting a few communities, one of the biggest pluses were

280
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:14,894
The plan that was put in place once it was passed by each community and the plan that notified our residents about the value of this process and the option of opting out.

281
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:29,054
question that came about was who would fund the notifications, all of the work that needed to be done to let all of our residents know about the opt-out.

282
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:44,223
With our last meeting and having the director from Melrose who came in and spoke so well on this issue, we answered a lot of questions that were brought to my attention that people had asked me about.

283
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,504
And how would we find out who would pay?

284
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:54,447
Well, it all comes under the company that would be awarded this project.

285
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:58,631
if and when it happens.

286
00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:08,325
So my biggest concern wasn't the community aggregation plan because I think it's needed.

287
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:12,431
I think it's something that every

288
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:17,312
constituent can use in bringing their electricity bill down.

289
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:19,975
I mean, not dramatically, but it does help.

290
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:25,801
And again, the biggest piece was getting the notification out to our residents.

291
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:33,189
And I was pleasantly surprised and optimistic now in making sure that

292
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:46,734
When that plan is released to the public, it's going to be very thorough and with as much information and time needed for our residents to opt out.

293
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:50,755
Because again, one of the issues we often hear is a lack of notification.

294
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:58,577
Well, with this plan, it falls back on the company that's awarded this project.

295
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,218
So that, in turn, goes back out to our residents.

296
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:08,662
I appreciate Councilor Langel-Curran for bringing this up, and I second her motion.

297
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:10,644
Thank you, Councilor Scott Palacios.

298
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:11,304
Councilor Knight.

299
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:13,066
Mr. President, thank you very much.

300
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:18,029
When it comes to municipal aggregation, this is a topic that I think we've been discussing now for over a year.

301
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:25,055
And quite frankly, the ball's in the council's court to determine whether or not this is something that we're going to allow the city to explore.

302
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:28,017
And again, I think the time to move forward on it is now.

303
00:26:29,198 --> 00:26:30,659
Ultimately, the question is, do we want

304
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:37,145
to request the department head to dedicate resources to something that hasn't been approved yet by this council.

305
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:39,827
We're asking a department head to say, start creating a list.

306
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:43,089
We may or may not adopt municipal aggregation.

307
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:45,471
And I think we're putting the cart before the horse, Mr. President.

308
00:26:45,491 --> 00:26:48,213
If we want to explore municipal aggregation, let's explore municipal aggregation.

309
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:49,774
Let's take the vote and let's allow it to happen.

310
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:55,658
But to dedicate resources to something that may or may not happen, I don't feel comfortable doing that.

311
00:26:57,972 --> 00:27:01,134
the Director of Energy and Environment to start to begin to create an opt-out list.

312
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:05,276
So she's going to dedicate resources in her office towards something that we may not adopt.

313
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:11,499
So I think that this might be a little bit counterintuitive at this point in time.

314
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,540
Mr. President, I'll have a difficult time supporting it this evening.

315
00:27:14,381 --> 00:27:14,741
Thank you.

316
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:16,962
Councilor Falco.

317
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,503
Thank you, Mr. President.

318
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:24,446
As many of you know, I've been on board with municipal aggregation since day one.

319
00:27:25,006 --> 00:27:27,247
I think it's a good, in my eyes, I think it's a good

320
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:28,567
I think it's a good plan.

321
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:29,528
I think it's a good program.

322
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:43,052
And I too think that, you know, we're at the point now where, you know, I think we've heard from, you know, you know, at the last meeting we heard from someone from the energy department at Melrose just to get a different perspective.

323
00:27:43,072 --> 00:27:44,873
And I think, I thought that was a very good presentation.

324
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:50,615
She did a great job and it was good to see how another city handled the communication and how they worked through the project.

325
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:53,796
And she had all kinds of samples of communications that they sent out.

326
00:27:54,547 --> 00:28:01,933
But I, in fact, I also agree with the Councilor, and I think we need to take a vote on this to see where we're going.

327
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:06,256
You know, I mean, I would, I guess I feel the same way.

328
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:09,759
I mean, I don't want to put resources working on something that might not even pass.

329
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,261
So, you know, let's, I think, you know, it's time.

330
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:16,244
This has been, I think municipal aggregation has been with us for over a year now.

331
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:21,448
We've had many meetings, Committee of the Wholes, we've taken one vote, it went down.

332
00:28:21,948 --> 00:28:26,693
and it's come back, but I think we need to take a vote on this.

333
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:32,379
And I think the paper is still in committee, or actually it's in committee of the whole, so I think we probably need to vote that out at some point.

334
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:39,767
But I think that, in my opinion, I really don't... I think a lot of our

335
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:42,393
departments to stretch with regard to resources.

336
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:50,538
And I would, I really don't, um, like the fact that we're going to put a resource towards building this list if this might not even pass.

337
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:55,621
So, um, I, I, I agree with my colleague, uh, Councilor Knight on this issue.

338
00:28:55,641 --> 00:28:56,322
So thank you.

339
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:57,242
Thank you.

340
00:28:57,923 --> 00:28:58,883
Councilor DelaRusso.

341
00:28:59,164 --> 00:29:00,244
Thank you, Mr. President.

342
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:09,370
Um, every presentation we've had on this matter from the office of energy and environment, which has been, they've been excellent presentations.

343
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:13,960
It's quite clear to me that the Office of Energy and Environment has an agenda.

344
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,142
Their agenda is to get Medford into municipal aggregation.

345
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:26,287
And so every presentation we've had has told us how wonderful and awesome and stupendous of an idea this is.

346
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:36,932
And maybe indeed it is, but we haven't had one credible, balanced presentation of what the negatives are with it, Mr. President.

347
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:39,754
And a lot of people are concerned about that in the community.

348
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:46,428
A lot of people think that it would be a good idea that we have, rather than an opt out, an opt in.

349
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:55,675
So the city offers it, and if people in the community want to do that and get together and do it, then they should opt in.

350
00:29:56,195 --> 00:30:03,861
Now obviously the vendors have something to benefit from by getting the greater portion of the community involved in this.

351
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:05,743
They have something to gain.

352
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:11,209
Obviously always someone has something to gain and there's nothing wrong with that.

353
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,216
I think this is a stretch in some areas.

354
00:30:14,623 --> 00:30:24,507
And I'm particularly concerned, Mr. President, that we'd create a list in advance of people who don't want to participate in this, who don't want to be a member of this.

355
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:25,768
What does this do to them?

356
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:27,709
Does this target them in some way?

357
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:29,429
Who has an access to this list?

358
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,251
Are they going to be contacted and given a spiel to get them to come aboard?

359
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:38,753
These are questions, serious questions that I have.

360
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:42,515
These are serious questions that people in the community have, Mr. President.

361
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,494
They need a voice as well.

362
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:46,515
I'm going to give them that voice.

363
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:49,597
And so I do not support this motion, Mr. President.

364
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:53,839
I think we need to have further discussion on municipal law, uh, aggregation.

365
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,023
And I think we need to have a credible bonafide expert on this matter.

366
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:03,725
Who's going to give, uh, the argument contra.

367
00:31:04,425 --> 00:31:05,466
Thank you, Mr. President.

368
00:31:05,986 --> 00:31:06,947
Thank you, Mr. Counselor.

369
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:08,548
Counselor.

370
00:31:09,388 --> 00:31:09,708
Thank you.

371
00:31:09,728 --> 00:31:11,930
Uh, president Carviel.

372
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,090
I,

373
00:31:12,952 --> 00:31:15,192
understand the sentiments of my colleagues.

374
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:18,973
I just, I don't feel, I have to just speak again on it, I guess.

375
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:28,655
I don't feel that it would take a great amount of resources to start an Excel spreadsheet and people call or write in, shoot a quick email to say they want to be on the opt-out list.

376
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:34,756
I actually think that it would ease a lot of people's fears, those that definitely do not want to be part of this.

377
00:31:35,296 --> 00:31:37,216
I think it's simple, take minutes.

378
00:31:37,716 --> 00:31:40,377
And I agree with Councilor De La Russo, there is an agenda and

379
00:31:41,715 --> 00:32:09,207
for the Office of Environment and Energy, but I don't think that that's what the people are concerned about, that the agenda won't be notifying people accordingly on their option to opt out, how many days they have to do it, and the fact that they have, they can opt out whenever, they're gonna be put in if they don't opt out within that first 30 days, and that's what people are concerned about, so that's why you would implement something like this

380
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:17,214
far beforehand, and you would be able to create that list, and people would be able to say, I want to opt out.

381
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:20,336
And they would get what they want.

382
00:32:20,376 --> 00:32:24,359
The people that don't want to be involved would be able to do that sooner than later.

383
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:29,842
And when the council does meet in Committee of the Whole again, maybe there would be the definite votes for it.

384
00:32:29,862 --> 00:32:31,723
And I think we're definitely close to it.

385
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:36,306
And I know people have definitely changed their minds, and they've learned a lot.

386
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,328
There are some people that maybe are still against it.

387
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:44,527
For me, this is something that would make me feel a whole lot better, knowing that they have more than that 30 days.

388
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:47,968
Because that's the complaints I've been getting.

389
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:56,190
And I thought this was just a way to sway another vote towards approving it and easing people's fears.

390
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,010
I'll say it again.

391
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,091
So I move approval.

392
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,652
I'd like to see how it goes.

393
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:06,373
And of course, we'll be meeting on it again in Committee of the Whole, probably after the holidays.

394
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:07,244
Thank you.

395
00:33:07,264 --> 00:33:09,205
Council of occurring vice president box.

396
00:33:10,106 --> 00:33:11,047
Thank you, Mr. President.

397
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:19,852
Um, I can't support this resolution tonight based on the fact that I agree with my colleagues that this is something that hasn't been approved by the council as of yet.

398
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:28,198
And, uh, I'm not going to partake in something that, um, is going to tell residents that they can get out of something that the council is going to vote on.

399
00:33:29,018 --> 00:33:31,840
Um, and in my opinion, what we should do,

400
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:42,397
And I've stated this from day one, Mr. President, is the Energy and Environment Committee, where this was sent at one point in this process, had a public hearing on it.

401
00:33:42,997 --> 00:33:44,838
And we asked the city solicitor to attend.

402
00:33:45,478 --> 00:33:58,964
And one of the questions, and it was actually my question, was whether or not we could file a home rule petition on behalf of this city and change the legislation, which is everyone has opted into the program.

403
00:34:01,938 --> 00:34:07,859
automatically and change it so it's, you can opt into the program.

404
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:21,143
And according to Mark Rumley, and I don't want to put words in his mouth, he spoke to House Counsel at the State House, and they believe that we could file a home loan petition.

405
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:23,363
And that is my number one concern.

406
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:31,285
You know, in my opinion, you know, when you get into utilities, that's between a homeowner and the utility company.

407
00:34:31,745 --> 00:34:35,588
not between the homeowner, the utility company, and the city of Meffitt.

408
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:39,730
I don't think we have any business getting involved, to be quite honest with you.

409
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:45,454
I realize this is a good intention to reduce our carbon footprint.

410
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:51,638
I realize that supposedly there's a cost benefit, too, by aggregating everyone together.

411
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:57,762
And so I realize what the intent is, but I as one member of the council

412
00:34:58,282 --> 00:35:18,704
Don't feel that everyone should be opted in automatically to a program and if this is such a great program It's going to be overwhelming people will be knocking on the door here at City Hall To get involved and say I want to opt into that program Let the program work let the program work so that would be my recommendation to

413
00:35:18,977 --> 00:35:29,623
Mr. President, that eventually, when we do discuss this again, that we file a home rule petition to reverse it, Mr. President, because the state legislature made a mistake, in my opinion.

414
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:31,384
Maybe it wasn't a mistake.

415
00:35:31,624 --> 00:35:41,489
Maybe it was intentional that they realized that, you know, a good majority of the people aren't going to opt out of the program, leaving them in the program, and that's where they're going to get their numbers from.

416
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:45,091
That's why they intended it and crafted the legislation that way.

417
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:47,072
I don't believe that should be the case.

418
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:48,713
I believe we should give residents

419
00:35:49,153 --> 00:35:50,694
of this community an option.

420
00:35:51,074 --> 00:35:54,056
If they want to opt into the program, then so be it.

421
00:35:54,096 --> 00:36:01,261
You can opt into the program, and I hope you save money, and I hope we move forward to reducing our carbon footprint, Mr. President.

422
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:10,647
There's also a section that I understand within this legislation that also allows a community to purchase more green energy.

423
00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:23,597
And you can do it on a one-to-one basis, but the community can decide as a community, saying, you know what, the 15% that we're required to buy, you know, we want to up it to 25 or 30%.

424
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:27,499
Now that's going to be a cost to everyone else in the community.

425
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,121
And you can opt out of that also.

426
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:32,383
But now you're saying you can opt out of the program.

427
00:36:32,803 --> 00:36:38,746
And if you happen not to opt out of the program, then if you don't want to pay the additional green energy, you have to opt out of that.

428
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:40,787
That's be up front with the people.

429
00:36:40,827 --> 00:36:43,708
Let them choose whether they want to partake in this program.

430
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:46,189
And I could support that, Mr. President.

431
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:52,432
So I can't support this resolution tonight because we haven't voted on any type of aggregation the way it stands.

432
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:54,513
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

433
00:36:55,493 --> 00:37:01,776
On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kern, seconded by, name and address of the record, please.

434
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:02,930
Thank you.

435
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,292
Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street.

436
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:09,613
Good evening, honorable counselors.

437
00:37:11,174 --> 00:37:14,355
I'm not against the energy, especially clean energy.

438
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:21,418
And if I may get a little bit off track, supposedly this country sent man to the moon a dozen times and brought him back safely.

439
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,440
If that's true, there's no excuse for us to be burning fossil fuels, period.

440
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:31,183
There's only a good reason, I'm sure, and that's capitalism from down deep in Texas.

441
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:42,065
And also, I believe Tesla, the famous inventor from Yugoslavia, was creating a power grid over 80 years ago, backed by J.P.

442
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:43,046
Morgan, I believe.

443
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:44,867
And once J.P.

444
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:53,092
Morgan found out that Tesla wanted to give free energy from power plant to power plant without wires, mind you, he pulled the plug.

445
00:37:53,192 --> 00:37:54,853
So, so much for capitalism.

446
00:37:57,094 --> 00:38:00,596
This community aggregation, I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing.

447
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:03,917
I don't know what's in it for the city.

448
00:38:03,937 --> 00:38:22,431
I don't know why they would force undemocratically to pull all, I'm estimating 40,000 national grid electric rate payers into the pool and making them opt out if they want to get out, which means they have to be proactive or, as I would say, reactive.

449
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:32,962
And very well could be, instead of me paying $0.10 for the delivery charge on my electric bill, it could come in at $0.16.

450
00:38:33,403 --> 00:38:34,543
I'm hearing different numbers.

451
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:40,306
There would be a 60% increase in my electric bill on the delivery charge only.

452
00:38:41,147 --> 00:38:50,211
So if I'm using an average of 400 kilowatts times $0.06 extra, that would be approximately $25, $26 extra.

453
00:38:50,431 --> 00:38:55,914
And to a lot of people who may be having a hard time

454
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:57,968
paying the electric bills as we speak.

455
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:04,673
So I just hope this community aggregation does not become community aggravation.

456
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:06,214
Thank you.

457
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:06,835
Thank you.

458
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:11,438
On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kernan, seconded by?

459
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,462
Seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

460
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:17,843
All those in favor?

461
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:17,923
Aye.

462
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:21,986
All those opposed?

463
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:23,106
Aye.

464
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:23,427
Opposed?

465
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:35,971
Motion fails.

466
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:38,052
Councilor Langel-Kern was in favor.

467
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:43,614
And George, and Councilor Scott-Pelley.

468
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:48,196
17781 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern, be it resolved that the administration look into replacing

469
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:59,252
with the help of Eversource, all lead pipes and outdated pipes that need an upgrade while the streets will be open during the construction period if the Eversource project is approved.

470
00:39:59,672 --> 00:40:00,773
Councilor Longo-Kern.

471
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:03,454
Thank you, President Carviello.

472
00:40:03,714 --> 00:40:14,060
We had met with Eversource last week and I know that a number of councilors asked questions with regards to the water pipes that are going to be closely

473
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:28,938
Doug Nair above or beside the Eversource pipes, and I know a number of ours are, we all know, they're 100 plus years old, and they are in need of replacement.

474
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:40,603
Now, I forget which councilor, but we all pushed to try to get Eversource to replace our water pipes, and they said they would approach it on a case-by-case basis.

475
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:44,185
I just wanna make sure that the city administration

476
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,224
really is on top of that.

477
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:48,044
I know Cassandra is going to be on top of it.

478
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:55,528
She seemed very eager to get Eversource to pay for the majority of this work, but they wouldn't commit to it.

479
00:40:56,028 --> 00:41:07,594
So I think it's very important that the administration really keeps a solid eye on this and whether or not Eversource replaces the water pipes that are going to need replacing, that we

480
00:41:08,195 --> 00:41:13,060
We look into doing this, whether this, in funding I'm sure is going to have to be appropriated.

481
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,862
So we think about this before our streets are even open.

482
00:41:16,263 --> 00:41:19,025
And I don't know if the administration has already thought about that.

483
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:23,189
Obviously, I understand we're going to try to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible.

484
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,193
But no matter what, I think these pipes need replacing.

485
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:32,338
And I think we need to definitely be proactive in making sure they do get replaced.

486
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,262
couple miles worth of digging up that Eversource is going to do in our streets.

487
00:41:38,402 --> 00:41:46,485
I think this should be paid for by Eversource, but our residents definitely deserve our infrastructure to be replaced.

488
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:50,426
And when the street's being dug up, I think it's important that we do it then.

489
00:41:50,566 --> 00:42:00,570
So whatever we have to do to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible and the city come up with the rest, I think it's important, especially if we go in there and we find very old piping.

490
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:01,617
Thank you.

491
00:42:02,118 --> 00:42:07,461
On the motion by Councilor Lococo, seconded by Councilor Falco.

492
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:08,241
All those in favor?

493
00:42:08,261 --> 00:42:08,802
Aye.

494
00:42:08,982 --> 00:42:09,943
Motion passes.

495
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:12,424
Reports of committee 17766.

496
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:23,171
Committee of the whole meeting from November 14th, 2017 regarding Enstar Eversource.

497
00:42:23,371 --> 00:42:25,072
And I have the report here which I will read.

498
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:36,881
The purpose of the meeting was to receive a presentation from Eversource on their request for grants of location on the transmission project from moving through Medford.

499
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:38,882
The following recommendations were made.

500
00:42:39,302 --> 00:42:43,506
That one, a traffic plan be submitted to the council and the police chief.

501
00:42:43,726 --> 00:42:49,731
Two, construction schedule with start dates, days of weeks, and times be submitted.

502
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:55,095
Three, that Eversource set up an informational meeting at the high school to include

503
00:42:56,307 --> 00:43:05,774
the winter street residents in a budding neighborhoods for that a contact name for the project with a telephone number and email be posted to the city's website.

504
00:43:07,716 --> 00:43:16,162
Five, that plans be provided by ever source on route on the route from question street to the city line that were included.

505
00:43:16,983 --> 00:43:17,223
Seven,

506
00:43:17,882 --> 00:43:20,784
Eversource develop a regional communication plan.

507
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:31,832
That plan would entail them developing a strategy of contacting TV and radio station, notifying non-Method residents about the project, and to notify them of alternate routes.

508
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:38,898
A motion was made by council tonight to send this report out.

509
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:41,660
May I answer?

510
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:44,861
Vice President Mott.

511
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:47,162
Was there a number six on that?

512
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:55,366
There was another mission somewhere along the line, I think there was only supposed to be seven, it ended up being eight.

513
00:43:56,247 --> 00:43:57,668
No, I, okay.

514
00:43:57,728 --> 00:44:13,833
I thought a number of, yeah, no, they were saying if I'm not mistaken as part of what council Longo just spoke about, um, I think I offered the motion, uh, during that meeting that, uh, as part of their detailed plan, that they also include, uh, the water hookups throughout the entire route.

515
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:18,175
And we asked that that be provided to us at our next meeting.

516
00:44:18,775 --> 00:44:20,916
And I think, uh, representatives from Eversource said,

517
00:44:21,276 --> 00:44:24,639
We can't possibly get that information this quickly and so forth.

518
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:34,288
But it was still a request of this council to get a plan of each hookup that they're going to be crossing over or under, water hookup.

519
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:35,870
Was that the meeting from last week or the week before?

520
00:44:37,271 --> 00:44:37,631
Last week.

521
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:38,752
It was last week.

522
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:40,234
This is from two weeks ago.

523
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:48,871
Okay, so we're not gonna, are we gonna get the next paper before next Tuesday's meeting?

524
00:44:49,091 --> 00:44:51,773
Okay, so those questions will come out again.

525
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:53,054
Yes.

526
00:44:53,074 --> 00:44:56,797
Well, our questions still go somewhere, right?

527
00:44:56,837 --> 00:44:57,358
When we ask

528
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:10,202
I mean, Eversource was before us.

529
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,464
We asked Eversource to produce some information.

530
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:17,268
Are you saying that information doesn't go anywhere?

531
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,312
Next week, when we meet next week with them again, we'll bring it up to them again.

532
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:24,133
Okay.

533
00:45:24,193 --> 00:45:24,393
Okay.

534
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:33,447
Councilor Dyson.

535
00:45:33,808 --> 00:45:43,255
So this is, Mr. President, when we met with Eversource, one of the things that Councilor Marks brought up was that there's a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated for mitigation.

536
00:45:43,696 --> 00:45:43,756
Yes.

537
00:45:43,776 --> 00:45:50,922
And that this isn't related to that meeting then, because one of the requests that Councilor Marks made was that the items that were brought to the table and denied, we wanted to know what those were as well.

538
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:51,382
Absolutely.

539
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:52,083
Yeah.

540
00:45:52,243 --> 00:45:55,425
So this is for the previous meeting, not the meeting that we just had the other day?

541
00:45:55,445 --> 00:45:55,566
Yes.

542
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,406
OK, sounds good to me.

543
00:45:56,426 --> 00:45:56,867
Move for approval.

544
00:45:56,907 --> 00:46:00,670
Also, the board has a memorandum that wouldn't be renegotiated.

545
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:03,070
Right.

546
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:06,412
But we may not get that information before next Tuesday.

547
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:07,872
This issue is coming up again, correct?

548
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:08,213
Yes, it is.

549
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,675
So we may not get that information prior to next Tuesday's meeting.

550
00:46:15,957 --> 00:46:16,577
That's an issue.

551
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,863
That's why I thought this was part of the paper that we were reading that included everything.

552
00:46:29,909 --> 00:46:39,514
I believe we tabled it because they didn't they couldn't complete all the questions we had and they didn't get to to explain their whole Communication plan.

553
00:46:39,934 --> 00:46:42,375
Yeah, we only got halfway through right halfway through.

554
00:46:42,395 --> 00:46:47,538
I think that's a and then we're completing it next week So is there a way that we can get?

555
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:51,980
So maybe the city engineer can give us some information.

556
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:54,462
All right, mr. Clerk if you could have this

557
00:46:55,158 --> 00:46:57,299
Let's let her sent up to the city engineer.

558
00:46:57,879 --> 00:47:00,181
Maybe she can help us out before the next week's meeting with that.

559
00:47:00,381 --> 00:47:05,924
If I may, Mr. President, I think the best approach would be to send it to Mr. Zamparelli from Ebersource, who's the government relations person.

560
00:47:06,404 --> 00:47:07,124
Oh, yeah, both.

561
00:47:07,144 --> 00:47:07,304
Good.

562
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,245
Could you take care of that, please?

563
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:09,946
Thank you.

564
00:47:12,867 --> 00:47:13,147
Thank you.

565
00:47:13,628 --> 00:47:15,028
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso.

566
00:47:15,068 --> 00:47:16,969
I believe I still have the floor, Mr. President.

567
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:17,430
I'm sorry?

568
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:18,610
I believe I still have the floor.

569
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,451
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

570
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:24,013
So we negotiated a memorandum of understanding, and as I understand the process based upon my discussions,

571
00:47:24,981 --> 00:47:34,806
is that the Department of Public Utilities has approved the project's specifications in terms of the cost, the route, the stretch that it's going to go.

572
00:47:35,447 --> 00:47:41,050
And the MOU was negotiated between the chief negotiator and the utility company for mitigation.

573
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:46,312
And what comes before us is the grant for access for right away to put the vaults in.

574
00:47:46,352 --> 00:47:51,075
If we fail to approve those vaults, then the next step in the process would be that Eversource would appeal.

575
00:47:51,592 --> 00:47:55,913
to the Department of Public Utilities because they're the ones that approved the project plan.

576
00:47:55,953 --> 00:48:01,375
And then the question comes as to whether or not DPU agrees to allow them to proceed.

577
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:05,596
And if they do, then the terms of the MOU, I believe, become null and void.

578
00:48:06,036 --> 00:48:07,497
So that's a concern that we have as well.

579
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:17,460
So I think that that's something that we need to ask the city solicitor at the next meeting is whether or not the terms of the MOU become null and void if the grants right away aren't approved and DPU has to step in.

580
00:48:22,787 --> 00:48:23,507
Vice President Mox.

581
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:33,593
I appreciate Councilman Light sharing that information and knowing that any approval comes before the mayor and also the council as a two-pronged approach.

582
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:43,930
It would be very helpful maybe in future projects that the administration sit down with this council and say, you know, we're, we're, we're, we're crafting an MOU memorandum of understanding.

583
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:47,492
Uh, you have partial approval of the streets.

584
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,193
Uh, what are your thoughts?

585
00:48:49,834 --> 00:48:51,615
And that would have been helpful, Mr. President.

586
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:58,760
So now we're after the fact negotiating with the utility company that has already entered into an agreement with the city administration

587
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:14,236
And in my opinion, I think we have every authority, otherwise it would be just a rubber stamp body just approving things to put conditions on this, Mr. President, that make sense to the rate payers and the tax payers of this community.

588
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:20,262
When you have a project coming into a city that has zero benefit to this community,

589
00:49:20,972 --> 00:49:24,674
I say zero benefit and 100% disruption.

590
00:49:25,314 --> 00:49:29,196
I think we have every right to stand up on behalf of the residents of this community.

591
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,538
So I look forward to speaking with the city solicitor on this.

592
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:34,739
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

593
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:35,700
Mr. President.

594
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,201
Counselor LaRusso.

595
00:49:37,761 --> 00:49:39,282
Motion that the paper be received.

596
00:49:40,618 --> 00:49:45,661
On the motion by Councilor De La Ruta, that the paper be received, seconded by Councilor Knight.

597
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:46,421
All those in favor?

598
00:49:46,761 --> 00:49:46,881
Aye.

599
00:49:47,342 --> 00:49:48,182
Motion passes.

600
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:54,705
Mr. President, while we're nearing the end of the meeting, may I make a motion for suspension of the rules to address a tabled matter?

601
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,386
Yes, you may.

602
00:49:55,886 --> 00:50:03,330
Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take up paper 17-764, request of the mayor to take 200 grand from free cash

603
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:10,027
for the plight of the people of Brooks Estate.

604
00:50:10,547 --> 00:50:12,689
Would you like me to read the communication?

605
00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:14,370
I wish you wouldn't, Mr. President.

606
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:25,137
We debated it extensively last week and we had a lot of words from those in favor from the gallery, Mr. President.

607
00:50:26,118 --> 00:50:27,599
Okay, move approval.

608
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:33,003
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russa to take

609
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:40,833
under suspension to take this paper 17764 off the table, seconded by Councilor Falco.

610
00:50:40,934 --> 00:50:41,674
All those in favor?

611
00:50:41,934 --> 00:50:42,034
Aye.

612
00:50:42,514 --> 00:50:43,394
Motion passes.

613
00:50:43,614 --> 00:50:46,455
Motion for approval on the paper, Mr. President.

614
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:56,837
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso on the paper, seconded by Councilor Falco.

615
00:50:56,977 --> 00:50:58,877
Mr. Clerk, please call.

616
00:50:58,997 --> 00:50:59,917
Mr. President.

617
00:51:01,178 --> 00:51:02,718
Councilor Mox, Vice President Mox.

618
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:05,519
Thank you, Mr. President.

619
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:21,613
As the financial steward of this community, as we are as a body, and the mayor is coming before us requesting $200,000 of taxpayers' money, I would ask that the administration answer a few questions regarding this money, Mr. President.

620
00:51:23,595 --> 00:51:25,377
And what questions would they be, Mr. Vice President?

621
00:51:25,864 --> 00:51:33,066
Well, if the administration appears before the podium, Mr. President, I'd be more than happy to relay my questions.

622
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:41,889
Obviously, we have no one from the administration here this evening to answer those questions, Mr. Vice President.

623
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:55,694
So the mayor is presenting a paper, Mr. President, a financial paper, and not one person can take the time out of their schedule to come up before the council to answer a question regarding

624
00:51:56,248 --> 00:51:57,268
taxpayers' money.

625
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:13,834
I just want the record to reflect that, Mr. President, that one person from the city administration was here last week, and they had ample opportunity because it was tabled for a week, or here tonight, Mr. President, to answer one question on behalf of the taxpayers of this community.

626
00:52:15,014 --> 00:52:24,137
But, Mr. President, I still will ask my questions that I posed last week, and many of them, as

627
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:34,866
representatives from the Brooks estates quite eloquently stated, uh, it's not under their Billy wig to answer why we don't have a capital plan in this community.

628
00:52:35,827 --> 00:52:43,977
And I could appreciate the fact that representatives from the Brooks estates, all volunteers that have been doing tremendous work to keep that

629
00:52:44,518 --> 00:52:58,621
building in the carriage house afloat for so many years, and actually moved towards the rehabilitation of the manor and the property, have done great work, Mr. President.

630
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:11,923
My concern, and I reiterated this last week, is not with the Brooks Estates, is not with shoring up a building that I witnessed just recently as a building that's on the verge of collapse.

631
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,381
I agree with that.

632
00:53:13,741 --> 00:53:20,369
I don't think anyone else could go over into that area or that building and say this building is not going to come down very shortly.

633
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:21,790
I think we all agree with it.

634
00:53:22,211 --> 00:53:29,959
My concern, Mr President, is why don't we have a game plan in this community on capital improvement?

635
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,601
This is one issue.

636
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:38,440
There are a laundry list of issues that we need a capital plan for.

637
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,541
Last week, I mentioned the fire departments.

638
00:53:42,401 --> 00:53:53,546
Each fire station has dire need, Mr. President, for upgrades and renovation in the fire stations where our brave men and women spend seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

639
00:53:56,136 --> 00:53:59,397
That is one aspect that needs a capital plan.

640
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:02,917
We're not going to be able to do that work within the confines of our budget.

641
00:54:03,638 --> 00:54:05,298
And I think we can all appreciate that.

642
00:54:06,638 --> 00:54:14,060
Over the last several years, every member of this council has spoken about the poor condition of our sidewalks and our roads.

643
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:25,162
And based on over the years, that information, this city has put zero dollars for road replacement in the budget.

644
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:33,344
$0.

645
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:33,344
The only money we get for road replacement is through Chapter 90 money through the state.

646
00:54:33,764 --> 00:54:45,233
It's about $980,000 a year, which is not going to be enough to start even remotely replacing and repaving the streets we know we need in this community.

647
00:54:45,594 --> 00:54:48,736
We're never going to get ahead of the game in the way we're doing business.

648
00:54:49,096 --> 00:54:53,400
We need a capital plan to address roads and sidewalks.

649
00:54:54,237 --> 00:54:58,218
We have yet to get any capital plan regarding roads and sidewalks.

650
00:54:58,698 --> 00:54:59,918
We talk about tree stumps.

651
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:10,620
Do we have to bring up the list again of tree stumps in this community that we just either don't have the will to take them out or don't have the funding to take them out?

652
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:11,700
It's one or the other.

653
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:17,101
I would hope it's the funding and not the will to take these out, Mr. President.

654
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:20,302
But that's another capital plan we need to move forward on.

655
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:21,582
Catch basins.

656
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,361
Talk to the DPW commissioner.

657
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:25,681
Go down any street.

658
00:55:27,122 --> 00:55:38,426
I'd venture to say, and this is just off the top of my head, 50 to 60% of our catch basins that are capturing rain runoff water and taking it out to the Mystic River are imploding.

659
00:55:38,907 --> 00:55:42,068
And they're sinking into the ground.

660
00:55:43,689 --> 00:55:44,709
We're not addressing these.

661
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,830
It needs to be a capital issue.

662
00:55:47,618 --> 00:55:50,560
It needs to be a capital issue that we have to move forward to.

663
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,621
Traffic calming measures.

664
00:55:52,721 --> 00:56:04,367
We just had a meeting about the revitalization of Method Square and the master plan, much of which calls for traffic calming plans on main street and high street and Salem street.

665
00:56:05,868 --> 00:56:13,412
We have many other streets in this community, upwards of 600 streets in this community that need the same traffic calming approaches.

666
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:22,323
But yet, we put nothing in the budget, or very little, I should say, to address these very important pedestrian safety issues.

667
00:56:23,443 --> 00:56:24,663
We need a capital plan.

668
00:56:25,484 --> 00:56:26,984
We're moving forward on a new library.

669
00:56:27,224 --> 00:56:27,744
That's great.

670
00:56:28,025 --> 00:56:31,026
We'll probably need a capital plan for that, a portion of that.

671
00:56:31,966 --> 00:56:33,626
We're moving forward on a police station.

672
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:37,828
We're probably going to need some type of capital plan moving forward on the police station.

673
00:56:40,715 --> 00:56:45,138
There are a lot of issues that we need a direction from this administration.

674
00:56:46,119 --> 00:57:00,409
The easy way out is to keep on allowing this administration to sit back and not give us a capital plan and take each issue one at a time.

675
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:01,910
That's our vision for this community.

676
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,412
When there's a need, we'll take the issue.

677
00:57:04,452 --> 00:57:09,195
The carriage house is going to fall down, let's take some money out of free cash, we'll repair that.

678
00:57:09,658 --> 00:57:12,363
We'll wait till the next emergency, we'll take care of that.

679
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:16,892
If we don't have a game plan in this community, we're never gonna move forward.

680
00:57:17,653 --> 00:57:18,875
We're never gonna move forward.

681
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:26,121
And whether this is the carriage house or any other issue in this community, I've preached about this for years now.

682
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:31,865
And members of this council, I think, can agree that we've all asked for capital plans over the last several years.

683
00:57:32,425 --> 00:57:37,509
And there have been few in coming by the last administration and this current administration.

684
00:57:38,209 --> 00:57:40,210
So I'm not going to continue to work piecemeal.

685
00:57:41,952 --> 00:57:43,733
If we want to ask the administration

686
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:51,820
To start looking at some of the needs we have in this community, I think we have to put our foot down at some point.

687
00:57:52,341 --> 00:57:54,102
The easy thing is just to prove everything.

688
00:57:54,742 --> 00:57:56,263
We have over $8 million in free cash.

689
00:57:57,684 --> 00:57:58,624
The coffers are open.

690
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:00,546
Just keep on approving it.

691
00:58:00,766 --> 00:58:01,906
That's the least resistance.

692
00:58:02,247 --> 00:58:03,247
That's just to prove everything.

693
00:58:03,467 --> 00:58:04,028
But guess what?

694
00:58:04,328 --> 00:58:06,429
Someday, those coffers are going to be closed.

695
00:58:07,009 --> 00:58:08,050
Time's not going to be as good.

696
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,012
We're not going to have a reserve of $8 million in free cash.

697
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:14,033
And the decisions are going to get tougher and tougher.

698
00:58:14,253 --> 00:58:20,020
And that's why we need to have a game plan to tackle the most important issues, the pressing issues.

699
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:27,770
So tonight, Mr. President, I'd like to find out what is the vision for the Brooks Banner?

700
00:58:28,856 --> 00:58:32,877
We had a group that did Yeoman's work, and we heard about it last week.

701
00:58:33,357 --> 00:58:44,380
Back in 2012, they created a master plan for the Brooks Estates and how the Brooks Estates is going to be able to be self-sustaining and reinvest back into the Brooks Estates.

702
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:57,523
And part of that vision was to use the carriage house as the economic engine, as a function hall, to generate money that we could put into road repair.

703
00:58:59,045 --> 00:59:03,066
I said this last week, and I hope people from the Brooks Estates don't get offended.

704
00:59:03,547 --> 00:59:05,887
You need a four-wheel truck to get up to the Brooks Estates.

705
00:59:07,088 --> 00:59:09,969
And if you make it up there in a four-wheel pickup truck, you're lucky.

706
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:12,089
That's how bad that road is.

707
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:13,370
It's awful.

708
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:17,291
It needs over a million and a half dollars of repair and underground utility.

709
00:59:19,372 --> 00:59:21,673
There's a lot of work that needs to take place up there.

710
00:59:22,153 --> 00:59:23,033
What's the vision?

711
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:25,074
We were presented with the vision in 2012.

712
00:59:25,734 --> 00:59:28,595
And what did this council do?

713
00:59:29,805 --> 00:59:30,605
We sat on it.

714
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:35,708
Five years later, now we're talking about buckling up the carriage house.

715
00:59:36,388 --> 00:59:40,070
Let's put an envelope over it and let it sit there for another five years.

716
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,191
That's our vision for the Brooks Estates.

717
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:46,652
That's what we're doing for historic preservation in this community.

718
00:59:49,134 --> 00:59:50,434
Let's bring the plan out again.

719
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:52,735
Let's discuss the plan.

720
00:59:52,975 --> 00:59:54,456
Let's see what our direction is.

721
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:58,898
If it's the druthers of this council not to approve the plan,

722
01:00:00,072 --> 01:00:04,713
again or not to ask for additional information, then so be it.

723
01:00:05,653 --> 01:00:13,554
But to wait five years and then put a band-aid approach to just putting a capsule over the building, yes, it will preserve the building.

724
01:00:13,995 --> 01:00:18,035
But we're still in the same spot we were, Mr. President, the same spot.

725
01:00:18,235 --> 01:00:19,456
We're not moving forward.

726
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:26,917
As Mr. Lincoln eloquently said last week, this is a city-owned building, no different than Chevalier.

727
01:00:29,357 --> 01:00:32,340
The city has to step up to the plate and take ownership.

728
01:00:33,722 --> 01:00:37,046
And ownership is not putting a band-aid on a much larger problem.

729
01:00:37,826 --> 01:00:45,355
So that would be my question to the mayor, or if your staff was here, what's the vision for the building for future use?

730
01:00:46,553 --> 01:00:49,034
Do you have the same vision that the Brooks Estates has?

731
01:00:49,675 --> 01:01:10,226
Completely restore two buildings, the Shepherd Brooks Manor and the Carriage House for public benefit, restore historic landscape, open space, natural habitat, capture the historic look and feel, promote biodiversity, improve habitat values, create the necessary economic engine to ensure long-term self-sufficiency of the property?

732
01:01:10,846 --> 01:01:11,847
Is that the mayor's goal?

733
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,274
That's what I'd like to know, Mr. President.

734
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:16,116
We're putting $200,000.

735
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:18,703
Is that the mayor's goal?

736
01:01:19,023 --> 01:01:22,372
Is the mayor going to come up with a capital plan that includes the Brooks estates?

737
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:29,193
These are the questions I think we as the financial stewards in this community should be asking.

738
01:01:29,913 --> 01:01:40,860
And the quick knee jerk reaction, I've talked to a lot of people, I got a lot of emails, Tommy did a great job, got a lot of emails from residents of this community, and actually it enlightened me on a lot of issues.

739
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:46,023
And I found myself, which many residents said, that's compromise.

740
01:01:46,964 --> 01:01:49,065
We need to secure the building, I agree.

741
01:01:50,101 --> 01:01:56,246
You know, we had a member of this council five years ago that said, let's tear down the building and build a new one.

742
01:01:58,087 --> 01:02:00,489
I mean, that was the thought five years ago.

743
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:05,013
I don't know how they're going to vote now, but maybe they have a change in heart.

744
01:02:07,034 --> 01:02:17,523
But I would ask Mr. President that this be a condition on the paper that the city administration present the council within the next six months.

745
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:24,232
After approval tonight, a capital plan addressing the city needs.

746
01:02:24,972 --> 01:02:27,773
You will have my vote tonight if we can get that.

747
01:02:28,093 --> 01:02:29,574
I think that's a simple request.

748
01:02:30,674 --> 01:02:35,376
We can move ahead with the $200,000, and we're asking as a council, which we should be.

749
01:02:36,057 --> 01:02:37,197
I think that should be unanimous.

750
01:02:38,018 --> 01:02:40,659
Madam Mayor, present us with a capital plan.

751
01:02:40,919 --> 01:02:42,439
You have six months to do so.

752
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,181
Present us with a capital plan.

753
01:02:45,201 --> 01:02:46,341
Let us know your directions.

754
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,562
Let us know if it includes the Brooks Estates.

755
01:02:49,521 --> 01:02:52,482
because these are the decisions we have to make as a body.

756
01:02:54,082 --> 01:03:11,548
And I'm prepared to make a decision either way tonight, but I thought if the people I spoke with that sent me emails and through my phone conversations, that this would be a great compromise to move the paper forward and also have an understanding that, Madam Mayor, we're gonna hold your feet to the fire.

757
01:03:12,657 --> 01:03:14,038
We're going to make sure you're accountable.

758
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:20,923
You may not want to come out with a list of things that you want to accomplish, because then we can measure you by that.

759
01:03:21,604 --> 01:03:23,105
So you may not want that on record.

760
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,005
But guess what?

761
01:03:24,546 --> 01:03:26,867
We as a city need to have that on record.

762
01:03:27,168 --> 01:03:30,150
We need that to move issues forward in our community.

763
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:42,419
So that would be my condition on this paper, Mr. President, that the administration present the council within the next six months, after approval tonight, a capital plan addressing all city needs.

764
01:03:43,504 --> 01:03:44,544
Point of order, Mr. President.

765
01:03:46,545 --> 01:03:47,785
Point of order, Councilor DelaRosso.

766
01:03:48,285 --> 01:03:53,227
Can we amend or make an attachment to a financial paper as such?

767
01:03:54,407 --> 01:03:55,807
Mr. Clerk, is that a possibility?

768
01:03:57,008 --> 01:04:06,310
This would be a little difficult because in six months the money might be already spent.

769
01:04:07,371 --> 01:04:08,991
It's not a condition to spend your money.

770
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:09,771
It's a condition.

771
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:11,452
If I could have my mic.

772
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:20,018
This is first of all a financial paper, and the council has purview over whether we approve it or not.

773
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:22,620
So we can put a condition on any paper.

774
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,921
Secondly, we do it all the time with utility companies.

775
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:39,267
When they come in and they ask us to do work and open our streets up, and they only want to repave the little area that they do work on, we put conditions of approval based on the fact that they have to do curb-to-curb restoration.

776
01:04:40,072 --> 01:04:41,593
So we put conditions all the time.

777
01:04:41,913 --> 01:04:42,713
This is no different.

778
01:04:42,733 --> 01:04:44,915
I had a conversation with the city solicitor.

779
01:04:45,255 --> 01:04:51,138
I won't speak for him, but this is no different than any other paper requesting us to approve something.

780
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:54,880
We're saying we will approve this, but you also have to do this.

781
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:59,762
So I don't think there's any problem putting a condition as I just mentioned.

782
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:04,165
So you want a vision for the whole city or just the Brooks Manor?

783
01:05:05,105 --> 01:05:07,546
Capital plan addressing the entire city's needs.

784
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:08,687
Capital plan.

785
01:05:10,059 --> 01:05:12,080
addressing the entire city.

786
01:05:14,681 --> 01:05:15,081
Thank you.

787
01:05:16,522 --> 01:05:17,322
Council Member Kern.

788
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:22,345
Thank you, President Carviello.

789
01:05:22,365 --> 01:05:38,272
I too have just concerns, not only about the capital plan, but I voiced my concerns last week and requested that we sit down with the administration with regards to not only the entire capital plan and where the Brooks Estates fits into that, but also

790
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:48,035
how we plan on moving forward with the restored or rehabbed building if we do spend the $200,000 to rehab it.

791
01:05:48,856 --> 01:05:50,437
I know that paper was failed.

792
01:05:50,537 --> 01:05:55,741
I think my questions could have been answered in a committee of the whole meeting, but we didn't have that.

793
01:05:55,881 --> 01:06:06,769
So I did reach out to Paul Mokey from the building department because I did have some questions, one of which was, if we do put $200,000 into the Carriage House

794
01:06:09,637 --> 01:06:10,417
Stabilize it.

795
01:06:10,898 --> 01:06:12,118
How long will that last us?

796
01:06:12,198 --> 01:06:15,160
And what you know, what can be you how can it be used?

797
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:29,568
briefly He did mention that he thinks it would stabilize the building for I'm gonna read word for around five years or so So say then between four and six years this building will be stabilized.

798
01:06:30,268 --> 01:06:32,309
I think he then went on to say that

799
01:06:32,595 --> 01:06:44,598
people could go in it, but you couldn't necessarily, and I'm not speaking for him, I did speak to him over the phone and I did email with him, but people couldn't necessarily be a use within the building.

800
01:06:45,518 --> 01:06:59,162
Then I reached out to the mayor's office yesterday morning and thankfully got a little bit of a response, which was any future, I asked, what is the plan, what's the vision, if we stabilize this building,

801
01:06:59,787 --> 01:07:04,028
How are we going to move forward, not only with CPA funds, but how are we going to move forward?

802
01:07:04,128 --> 01:07:12,529
And the answer was, any future work for the Brooks Estates to be considered for funding through the CPA, which is great.

803
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:22,451
I think we have a good amount of money in the CPA that is in will and should go to a number of different things.

804
01:07:23,031 --> 01:07:28,552
So in my head, calculating it a little bit, if you even took half of the CPA funds,

805
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:38,602
to rehab the building, and obviously you need the money to fix the road so that it could be economically viable as an option for a function facility.

806
01:07:38,662 --> 01:07:40,263
You need the $4 million.

807
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:48,585
Even if you took half of the CPA funds, you would only come up with between $2.5 and $3 million.

808
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:58,727
You wouldn't have the funds to rehab the building for the purpose that, you know, the committee has obviously presented to us in the past.

809
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,561
And that's where I find it concerning.

810
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:04,722
Yes, this building needs to be stabilized.

811
01:08:04,922 --> 01:08:09,444
But if we're going to spend the $200,000, I want to know that it's for a purpose.

812
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,806
And I didn't get that answer from the mayor.

813
01:08:12,606 --> 01:08:16,708
Are we going to use any of city monies to?

814
01:08:17,988 --> 01:08:23,331
And those are the questions that I think still are outstanding and need to be answered for my vote.

815
01:08:24,702 --> 01:08:35,229
Yes, I would want to stabilize the building, but I want to know the plan, not only for that, but for the fire stations, for the roads, for all the other complaints that we get and money that we need to spend money on.

816
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:43,435
I think of the fire department taking the tour, and where they shower, there is like mold coming out of the bottom of the stalls.

817
01:08:43,475 --> 01:08:45,096
And nobody talks about that.

818
01:08:46,597 --> 01:08:50,360
We're not asked to put money towards fixing the bathrooms in the fire department.

819
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,522
There's just so many different needs.

820
01:08:54,455 --> 01:09:00,596
I think the last time we got the capital plan was last January, February, two years ago, almost two years ago.

821
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:06,778
And we sat with the mayor for an hour, we looked at the capital plan, and I think this was a component in the capital plan.

822
01:09:07,318 --> 01:09:10,039
It didn't pass two years ago, and now it's before us again.

823
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:23,382
And I just think after two years, we need to sit down with the mayor as soon as next week and discuss how we're gonna move forward with the Brooks Estate, and how we're gonna move forward in this city entirely.

824
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:26,206
can't receive a paper.

825
01:09:26,346 --> 01:09:32,367
Last week I did table it, because what the paper said was, please approve $200,000 for the Brooks Estates.

826
01:09:32,447 --> 01:09:40,370
Thankfully, the Brooks Estates had somewhat of a breakdown, which was more than we sometimes get from the city administration.

827
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:50,413
But for Paul Moki to not even know it came before us last week, and not really, he's going to be, the building department is going to be involved in all of this.

828
01:09:50,473 --> 01:09:52,994
And for him to not even know, never mind be available to

829
01:09:53,501 --> 01:09:58,964
answer our questions in a Committee of the Whole meeting, I find that extremely concerning for the taxpayers in this community.

830
01:10:00,045 --> 01:10:03,807
If I voted for this tonight or last week, I wouldn't be able to answer their questions.

831
01:10:03,907 --> 01:10:10,990
I wouldn't be able to say necessarily what the plan was or what I was even necessarily fully voting on.

832
01:10:12,051 --> 01:10:13,872
And I don't think that's right.

833
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:16,854
I again ask that we just sit with the mayor and discuss this.

834
01:10:17,194 --> 01:10:22,076
You very well may have my vote next week if I sit with the mayor and just figure out her vision.

835
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:29,627
for a million to a million and a half to do a road, plus the rehab to completely redo the building.

836
01:10:30,348 --> 01:10:39,071
And then it hit the nail on the head last week when the new member of the board, who was very well-spoken, did mention that, why don't we take it down and rebuild it?

837
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:41,772
And I think one of the councilors said that a couple years ago.

838
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:41,972
It was me.

839
01:10:42,433 --> 01:10:45,094
Yeah, Councilor Carvillo, you said that, why don't we rebuild it?

840
01:10:45,114 --> 01:10:46,554
It would cost us less money.

841
01:10:47,175 --> 01:10:50,696
And I mean, nobody wants to, we want to preserve it, but it's,

842
01:10:51,724 --> 01:10:55,945
You have to be realistic in a way where we have needs.

843
01:10:56,245 --> 01:10:57,366
People want a library.

844
01:10:57,646 --> 01:11:00,066
People want new fire station.

845
01:11:00,146 --> 01:11:03,087
We're building a new police station for millions and millions of dollars.

846
01:11:03,367 --> 01:11:07,348
We have needs and maintenance issues in our schools that need to be addressed.

847
01:11:08,029 --> 01:11:09,789
So where does this fit in?

848
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:12,530
And that's where I'm concerned tonight.

849
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,150
It's where I was concerned last week.

850
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:20,352
Forget about personnel that we need to hire and to make our police and fire to the staffing levels that

851
01:11:21,232 --> 01:11:34,877
people, you know, the city wants, there's just so much that goes into this money papers and we never get a good enough, we usually always meet in the Committee of the Whole, we get our questions answered, we discuss it, we round table it.

852
01:11:35,197 --> 01:11:40,359
For this, you know, we obviously didn't meet in Committee of the Whole and I practically begged for it last week.

853
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:43,860
I think we need a meeting with the mayor on this one.

854
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,441
Thank you, Council.

855
01:11:46,121 --> 01:11:46,681
Councilor Knight.

856
01:11:47,292 --> 01:11:48,752
Uh, Mr. President, thank you very much.

857
01:11:48,832 --> 01:11:55,293
I can certainly agree with my colleagues that there are many needs in this community and prioritizing these needs are vital.

858
01:11:55,753 --> 01:11:57,714
And, uh, that's why we get elected.

859
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:08,256
Um, the redevelopment of the carriage house and the creation of the Shepard Brooks estates, um, to be a full fledged function hall was part of the chart.

860
01:12:08,276 --> 01:12:10,796
The course plan that was presented by mayor McGlynn.

861
01:12:11,436 --> 01:12:16,117
Um, it was the last item that came before this council as part of the chat, the course plan and the council voted it down.

862
01:12:18,572 --> 01:12:28,220
After the council voted the plan down, Mr. President, about a year passed, and the members of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust came to the council and said, the carriage house is the key focal piece of our master plan.

863
01:12:29,341 --> 01:12:35,406
Regardless of whether or not the council supports the master plan, the carriage house is the key focus of their master plan and what direction they want to go in.

864
01:12:35,506 --> 01:12:42,152
They want to utilize the carriage house in the area that the carriage house is on to make an economic catalyst for the Sheppard Brooks Estates.

865
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:45,011
And they came before us and they asked for this money.

866
01:12:45,051 --> 01:12:52,453
And we had a committee of the whole with Paul Mulkey and they had people come in and they had people do an assessment of this carriage house and tell us what it was gonna cost to tie it up.

867
01:12:53,154 --> 01:12:54,214
And we had a committee of the whole on that.

868
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,795
And that was all we had.

869
01:12:57,455 --> 01:13:00,236
And now here we are, a winter's past, another winter's coming.

870
01:13:01,036 --> 01:13:10,620
And the individuals at Shepherd Brooks Estates are here before us again this evening asking us for $200,000 to shore up the key piece and the key component of their master plan.

871
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:20,353
Regardless of whether or not we support the master plan, Mr. President, the Carriage House is an essential part of the redevelopment of that area.

872
01:13:21,133 --> 01:13:22,614
The Carriage House is the catalyst.

873
01:13:23,914 --> 01:13:25,735
The Carriage House is also falling apart.

874
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:26,375
It's a disgrace.

875
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:29,656
I mean, any one of us could go up there, and if we look at it, it's not a Carriage House.

876
01:13:29,716 --> 01:13:31,217
It's a shell of a building that's falling apart.

877
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,482
But that shell of a building does have historic significance, Mr. President.

878
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:42,066
Week in, week out, we talk about historic preservation, demolition delay, historic significance, historic districts.

879
01:13:42,386 --> 01:13:48,749
This is the most historic — one of the most historic homes, I should say, because we do have the Royal House, we do have the Peter Tufts House, we do have some very historic properties in the community.

880
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:50,370
But this is by far the most beautiful.

881
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:54,392
It's got 50 acres of land that surround it, and there are many opportunities and options up there.

882
01:13:54,873 --> 01:13:59,055
And I think one thing that we need to do is preserve the carriage house, because maybe, although we don't agree with the master plan,

883
01:13:59,732 --> 01:14:03,494
I think we can all agree that the Carriage House is a vital component to what's going on up there.

884
01:14:04,134 --> 01:14:05,955
There are many options and many opportunities for us.

885
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:11,018
And we might have to go back to the drawing board on this master plan because the council hasn't funded it in the past and they may not fund it again in the future.

886
01:14:11,078 --> 01:14:11,418
I don't know.

887
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:16,481
But what I do know is this, the Carriage House is vital to the economic success at that location.

888
01:14:16,821 --> 01:14:27,287
And this evening I'm comfortable supporting a $200,000 free cash appropriation based upon the history and based upon the presentation that was given to us in the past, the presentation that was given to us last week.

889
01:14:28,407 --> 01:14:29,328
And quite frankly,

890
01:14:29,702 --> 01:14:34,925
the vital need that we have at Sheppard Brooks Estates, if we're going to turn it into an economic catalyst to maintain the carriage house, Mr. President.

891
01:14:34,945 --> 01:14:38,207
So with that being said, um, I'm supportive of the paper this evening and I move for approval.

892
01:14:40,068 --> 01:14:40,408
Thank you.

893
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:41,049
Councilor Nye.

894
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:44,331
On the motion by Councilor Falco.

895
01:14:44,891 --> 01:14:45,712
Thank you, Mr. President.

896
01:14:46,032 --> 01:14:48,613
I also want to go on the record of supporting this.

897
01:14:48,914 --> 01:14:56,038
Um, I take a look at the Brooks Estate and I take a look at the, uh, the money that, um, I mean, I look at it as,

898
01:14:56,421 --> 01:14:59,404
If we appropriate this money tonight, to me, to me, this is an investment.

899
01:14:59,564 --> 01:15:01,245
It's an investment in the Brooks estate.

900
01:15:01,806 --> 01:15:03,087
It's an investment in our community.

901
01:15:03,187 --> 01:15:07,671
I mean, there are other cities and towns that would really love to have a property like this.

902
01:15:07,891 --> 01:15:11,614
Uh, like council and I said, 50 acres of, uh, open space.

903
01:15:11,634 --> 01:15:12,915
I think it's a great opportunity.

904
01:15:13,435 --> 01:15:17,519
Um, and I think that's something that we need to look at, but I think we need to, I think we need to embrace this.

905
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:18,680
I mean, I think that this is a,

906
01:15:19,378 --> 01:15:20,579
This is a historical site.

907
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:25,102
Um, I think there's a lot of opportunity here, the potential to actually bring in revenue.

908
01:15:25,122 --> 01:15:28,424
Um, so this is something that I do support as well.

909
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:29,204
Thank you.

910
01:15:29,285 --> 01:15:29,605
Thank you.

911
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,126
Counselor Falco.

912
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:32,146
Counselor Scott Pelley.

913
01:15:32,266 --> 01:15:33,167
Thank you, Mr. President.

914
01:15:33,187 --> 01:15:34,908
I don't want to be redundant, but I will.

915
01:15:35,589 --> 01:15:44,294
Um, I think that, um, you know, the, the, the issues of, of having that master plan, I think it's very important.

916
01:15:44,314 --> 01:15:46,536
I think that we wouldn't be, um,

917
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:51,300
We wouldn't be true to this position if we weren't looking at the bigger picture.

918
01:15:51,340 --> 01:16:07,589
But the truth of the matter is, as one person put it, to hold this valuable historic piece hostage, in a sense, would be frightening to me if we would lose it over the winter because we didn't fund it.

919
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:09,090
Unfortunately,

920
01:16:09,548 --> 01:16:38,158
We weren't part of those discussions years ago, and I think the plan that was put in place, and with the CPA that's now in front of us, and what we talked about last week, using the Brooks Estates as a viable revenue source, I think it's something that, as someone that worked very hard on the recreation piece over the past few years, and talking to the

921
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:52,285
friends from the Brooks states and looking into different avenues that we can capture funding, I think it's a positive move forward and the thought of possibly losing the Carriage House to me is unacceptable.

922
01:16:52,365 --> 01:16:59,829
So one thing we did preach over the last few years is our support to our historical sites and

923
01:17:01,307 --> 01:17:09,750
to, in my eyes, I feel that this Carriage House is one of the granddaddies of them all, so I'm going to support this paper.

924
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,310
Thank you.

925
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:12,171
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

926
01:17:13,191 --> 01:17:23,355

927
01:17:25,616 --> 01:17:26,536
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

928
01:17:27,117 --> 01:17:30,678
I just want to note my opposition because I believe

929
01:17:31,223 --> 01:17:33,744
Questions need to be answered, even if it just took a week.

930
01:17:35,065 --> 01:17:36,266
Thank you, Counselor Long and Kern.

931
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:37,946

President Caviello?

945
01:17:51,113 --> 01:17:51,393
Yes.

946
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,715
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

947
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:56,376
Motion passes.

948
01:18:02,287 --> 01:18:02,707
It's tabled.

01:18:03,968 --> 01:18:04,828
Councilor Dela Russo.

Thank you, sorry to interrupt.

951
01:18:07,088 --> 01:18:08,849
I'll withdraw my remarks.

952
01:18:09,209 --> 01:18:09,569
Thank you.

953
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:25,314
Well, we have the meeting on December 26th, the city council meeting will be canceled so everybody knows.

954
01:18:27,615 --> 01:18:27,795
The

955
01:18:30,721 --> 01:18:37,105
Do we have a motion to, seconded by Councilor Del Rosso, that we cancel the December 26th City Council meeting?

956
01:18:37,685 --> 01:18:38,666
So moved, Mr. President.

Motion passes.

961
01:18:43,008 --> 01:18:44,609
Merry Christmas, Mr. President.

962
01:18:44,629 --> 01:18:45,510
We're not ready for Merry Christmas.

963
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:51,333
The table records of the meeting of October 31st were passed to Vice President Marks.

964
01:18:51,373 --> 01:18:53,835
Mr. Vice President, how did you find those records?

965
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:54,895
Mr. President.

966
01:18:54,915 --> 01:18:57,377
I apologize, I have not had an opportunity to read the records.

967
01:18:59,088 --> 01:19:00,349
Do you think we'll have them by the end of the year?

968
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:02,571
I'm hoping it'll be my New Year's resolution.

969
01:19:02,851 --> 01:19:03,131
All right.

970
01:19:04,312 --> 01:19:09,397

01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:13,760
In my infirmity, Mr. President,

973
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:18,213
Thank you.

974
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:21,274
And I want to remind everybody that tomorrow is the holiday glow.

975
01:19:22,235 --> 01:19:26,716
And over the weekend, you see all these nice trees in the chambers here.

976
01:19:27,156 --> 01:19:31,478
I want to thank the ladies from the Jingle Bell Committee who do this every year.

977
01:19:32,258 --> 01:19:38,180
And all the monies raised from this event go to the Buddy Collins Center in Medford.

978
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:39,921
It's a very worthwhile organization.

979
01:19:40,561 --> 01:19:42,541
I'm pleased to partake of it over the weekend.

980
01:19:43,142 --> 01:19:43,542

Mr. President, if we could.

Vice President Mox.

984
01:19:49,508 --> 01:19:50,909
I just want to thank Mr. President.

985
01:19:50,949 --> 01:19:59,014
Over this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, we had a very important democratic moment in this community where we had a recount.

986
01:19:59,835 --> 01:20:05,699
And there were many, many volunteers that spent eight to nine hours on both Saturday and Sunday.

987
01:20:06,379 --> 01:20:11,103
And I just want to thank all the volunteers that allowed this process to move forward.

988
01:20:11,803 --> 01:20:14,125
And I want to thank this city.

989
01:20:15,046 --> 01:20:16,788
for being a great city to live in, Mr. President.

990
01:20:17,068 --> 01:20:24,378
I was one of those volunteers, and to see how the process worked was quite an experience, and I'm glad I was here to help.

991
01:20:24,398 --> 01:20:29,685

Aye.

Motion passes.
