[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to go right into questions here.

10
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:57,048
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we normally do, first question, just tell us a little bit about yourself.

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,492

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lifelong Medford resident.

00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:07,719
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born here at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,721
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never left.

16
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:16,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I attended Medford High School and Davenport School, Roberts Junior High.

17
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,926
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been all over the city.

18
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:19,868
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole thing, you... Yes.

19
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:27,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of my work history is I'm in the hospitality industry, catering and concessions.

20
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:34,774
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come by the farmer's market on Thursdays, you'll probably bump into me and my children selling Italian ice.

21
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:37,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you do a good job with that, too, by the way.

22
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:38,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

23
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:39,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you really do.

24
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:42,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a lifelong Method resident.

25
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:43,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

26
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:44,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.

27
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,000
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the reasons

28
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, thank you for running for council.

29
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:53,790
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.

30
00:01:54,371 --> 00:02:00,039
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are the reasons making you run for Medford City Council?

31
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,081
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why do you want the job, Paul?

32
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:07,809
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I want the job is I want to be the voice for the people of the citizens of Medford that aren't being heard.

33
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:16,981
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people out there that they don't have this, they don't have an opportunity to be heard.

34
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:21,465
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to be that person to represent the people of Medford.

35
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:26,069
[SPEAKER_01]: To put out information, listen to the people, do what the people want.

36
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's correct.

37
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,533
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff going on that people need to know about.

38
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, do you want to get into what's going on?

39
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:37,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a few things maybe?

40
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:38,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Charter change.

41
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:39,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

42
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:41,186
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big one.

43
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:41,966
[SPEAKER_01]: That was huge.

44
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:42,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

45
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:48,289
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with a lot of things that's happening.

46
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:53,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoning, taxes, cost of living, the infrastructure and roads.

47
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:56,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

48
00:02:57,314 --> 00:03:00,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people agree with you, Paul, because the roads.

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the roads, the infrastructure, yeah.

50
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:09,383
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people listening and watching that are going to agree with that.

51
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:15,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, some of those are good reasons.

52
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:20,227
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as a council, let's say you get on the council, you become a council member.

53
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:22,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Any solutions?

54
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:27,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what do you look to do to resolve all these issues?

55
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,271
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, Mr. Gabb is the gateway to the city.

56
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:31,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

57
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:42,912
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 35 years ago, people on the council had an idea to change Mystic Ave and it was outvoted and it didn't happen.

58
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:47,694
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that that is where we should start.

59
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:53,917
[SPEAKER_00]: We should focus our attention on Mystic Ave commercial and industrial zoning.

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:17,314
[SPEAKER_00]: high-rises we have that whole side of uh... ninety-three right that we could put high-rises and mixed-use pedestrian walkways and bear garden things that uh... we deserve not only for us but bring some other people into it

61
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:24,404
[SPEAKER_01]: So why, I mean, do you see any steps?

62
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:31,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's this, the current people running the city, do you see, I mean, what do you see getting done?

63
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:39,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see any steps being taken as far as, you know, Mystic Ave is a great one, the squares, I mean, what do you see?

64
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:46,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that the focus should be on neighborhoods and residentials at this time.

65
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

66
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,801
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we should focus on our commercial.

67
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:52,843
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Cane's Potato, the old Cane's Potato Chips, GE.

68
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:55,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I forgot all about that.

69
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:55,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Cane's, yeah.

70
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:57,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Cane's Potato Chips, GE.

71
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:00,026
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's high-rise buildings there.

72
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:11,392
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build as high as you want, or 14 stories, 30, whatever it may be, and it's not gonna take away sunlight and ruin the neighborhoods that we currently have.

73
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:12,593
[SPEAKER_00]: People move to this city,

74
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:22,599
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago in the 50s and 60s because of the neighborhood feel and the The comfortability of knowing your neighbors and I don't think that's happening anymore.

75
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:32,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that If they try to change the zoning in the neighborhoods It's gonna ruin some of that feel Yep.

76
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:33,606
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.

77
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:42,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't want to see that in my yeah, no, I mean I I agree I agree with that I mean it seems like they're

78
00:05:44,605 --> 00:06:13,565
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they're focusing on parts of the city it's all residential and what they need to focus on i agree is the squares mystic ave so much that potential that we have here in the city that uh... we're not using right now those sites have been empty for a long time on mystic valley parkway you want housing that's the perfect place to start so i mean

79
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, my next question, I was going to follow up on the zoning.

80
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:23,233
[SPEAKER_01]: We're discussing it.

81
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:25,154
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about what your opinions are.

82
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you covered it all, really.

83
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,737
[SPEAKER_00]: So roads and infrastructure.

84
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:31,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

85
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:34,359
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put Band-Aids on the streets right now.

86
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:35,039
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

87
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,160
[SPEAKER_00]: We need billions of dollars.

88
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:40,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Not millions, we need billions.

89
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:41,882
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've heard, yes.

90
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:42,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Billions of dollars.

91
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,384
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that they should be just patching up roads.

92
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start in the bottom.

93
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:53,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put in new gas lines, water lines, sewer lines.

94
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,888
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're at it, cable and electric.

95
00:06:56,248 --> 00:07:02,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they could, you know, if they're digging up the streets and the streets open, let's move the pipes underground.

96
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

97
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:03,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

98
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,671
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way we can

99
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:08,053
[SPEAKER_00]: protect ourselves from future storms.

100
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:13,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we haven't really had any snow or some serious storms.

101
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:14,196
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been lucky.

102
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:19,139
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know what's going to happen 25, 50, 100 years from now.

103
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,121
[SPEAKER_00]: The infrastructure is over 100 years old.

104
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:30,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that we need to start there and getting some of the funds from the electric and the gas companies.

105
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:31,807
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll let them pay for it.

106
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:41,037
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that when you dig up the street, they should be doing curb to curb.

107
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:43,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Pat's work.

108
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I hear you on that.

109
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:53,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm only laughing because we all know, I mean, we've seen it, oh, I can name a dozen, Winthrop Street, I mean, all over the place.

110
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:58,853
[SPEAKER_01]: where they come, I mean they do, they'll go up the length of a street.

111
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:01,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Willis Ave, they're doing stuff right now.

112
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how that's gonna end up coming out.

113
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:10,054
[SPEAKER_00]: In my study that I've been doing, the city of Medford does about 10 streets a year, complete streets.

114
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:10,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

115
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:17,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we need to have a 10 year program and we need to build it up to 30 streets, to 40 streets a year.

116
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:18,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

117
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:21,336
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to get to that 10 to 15 year goal.

118
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:23,257
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, yeah.

119
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:24,577
[SPEAKER_00]: To fix all of our streets.

120
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:27,137
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plan, yeah.

121
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:32,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the electric company and gas company pay for some of that infrastructure repair.

122
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,879
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that are digging up our streets after it's just repaved.

123
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:38,900
[SPEAKER_00]: You just mentioned Winthrop Street, they repaved it.

124
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,180
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times?

125
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Three or four times they had to cut it up, open it, and start again.

126
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know some people that live up there, they weren't too happy.

127
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:48,522
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kept, it was like,

128
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,554
[SPEAKER_01]: The ongoing saga never ending digging.

129
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:53,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what it seemed like.

130
00:08:53,836 --> 00:09:03,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but uh, yeah, you know great answer, uh Yeah, it makes sense to to sort of do it all at once get it done do it right and while you're open

131
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:05,893
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a novel idea.

132
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:08,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Fix everything at the same time.

133
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,216
[SPEAKER_00]: And then move on.

134
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:10,277
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit at a time.

135
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:12,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to get into economic development.

136
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:29,978
[SPEAKER_01]: In this city, anyhow, I mean, it's stagnant at best.

137
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:33,160
[SPEAKER_01]: We just haven't, you know, and I don't know what the reasons are.

138
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what's going on.

139
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,762
[SPEAKER_01]: But you mentioned Mr. Gav.

140
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:40,663
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much potential.

141
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:44,785
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyhow, what are you going to do to get?

142
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:48,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know the current council voted to change Salem Street.

143
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,448
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start with that if you'd like.

144
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:50,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

145
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:51,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

146
00:09:52,187 --> 00:10:00,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if a new council is elected, we can bring back some of those ordinances and things that they have changed.

147
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:09,074
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can change the council, we can change some of the things that they have brought forward.

148
00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:12,676
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're talking about this, but I don't think the council should be talking about

149
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,584
[SPEAKER_00]: issues not in the city of Medford.

150
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:17,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

151
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:18,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?

152
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:23,965
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we didn't bring it up, but... Yeah, no, it's... I mean, yeah, I mean... Let's focus on what's going on in our city.

153
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:24,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

154
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:30,267
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that I'm concerned about what's going on in other parts of the country and in the world.

155
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:31,567
[SPEAKER_00]: We all are, right.

156
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,268
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, Medford needs us.

157
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:35,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

158
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:43,562
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's focus on Medford before we start focusing on the rest of the country and the world right now, in my opinion.

159
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:49,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that makes perfect sense, because there are a lot of issues in Medford.

160
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:51,703
[SPEAKER_01]: We discussed some.

161
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:56,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Parking, there's so many issues that we could talk about.

162
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:59,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And the zoning, I don't know how you feel about it.

163
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:02,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get back to it, but it just seems like it's

164
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,680
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just being pushed.

165
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,863
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even a question of, it's just like being forced.

166
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:14,426
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna take this, we're gonna build or do whatever with these lots.

167
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:18,869
[SPEAKER_01]: It's confusing to people, it's complicated.

168
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,090
[SPEAKER_00]: The people need to be informed.

169
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,132
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not being informed properly.

170
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:28,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Robocalls, brochures, let's, if we're gonna do this, let's do it right.

171
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:30,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not rush it.

172
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:36,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I mean just like the charter change it took the charter change was in process for 10 years, right?

173
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:41,885
[SPEAKER_00]: It took the charter commission two years to come up with a plan And they came up with a great plan.

174
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought so they came up with a great.

175
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,648
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought so at the last minute

176
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,529
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some doors, backdoor deal or whatever.

177
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something happened because it got changed.

178
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they tried to change it.

179
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:53,531
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to change it.

180
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,552
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank God the mayor stepped up.

181
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:56,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

182
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the last minute she conceded to a few things.

183
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:00,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

184
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:05,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that she did a great job by keeping ward representation.

185
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:08,537
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully it passes the legislature.

186
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:09,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so.

187
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:16,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she definitely, what we would say in the old days, I say the old days, but she told the line for us.

188
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:16,768
[SPEAKER_01]: She really did.

189
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:17,208
[SPEAKER_00]: She did.

190
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:18,270
[SPEAKER_00]: When it came to that.

191
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,732
[SPEAKER_01]: She held her ground.

192
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:20,854
[SPEAKER_00]: She did hold her ground.

193
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:22,135
[SPEAKER_00]: She did a good job.

194
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,561
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about a lot of good stuff.

195
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:30,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what you're saying.

196
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:31,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.

197
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:33,424
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like what you're saying.

198
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:35,025
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.

199
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:40,588
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of like a general question, okay?

200
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:41,809
[SPEAKER_01]: What

201
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:48,038
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see for the future of Method?

202
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:50,879
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you envision?

203
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:54,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bring in some big-name companies.

204
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now the mayor is looking at Budweiser for Market Basket.

205
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,722
[SPEAKER_00]: If Market Basket doesn't work, they have their own internal problems going on right now.

206
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:30,194
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion again this is my opinion with uh... encore and everything that's going on and they're trying to build a soccer stadium there's nothing for families and children to do okay in that area and i believe that uh... something like just throwing it out there a great wolf lodge something for families that you know

207
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:35,959
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get a good tax break from a big hotel chain like that to come in.

208
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:37,500
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a perfect location.

209
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor activities, something for families to do.

210
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:46,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandchildren, children of all ages can go in there and enjoy themselves.

211
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:53,293
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do hope that the mayor and everybody can get together and bring in a market basket.

212
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:58,317
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that fails, that's just something I'm throwing out there, in my opinion.

213
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:01,679
[SPEAKER_00]: big business is what we need.

214
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,703
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to say, at the beginning of the conversation, I drive around the city all the time.

215
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:12,747
[SPEAKER_01]: You made some great points because I live down, I'm on Windsor, so.

216
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:13,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

217
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:23,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I drive by the old Canes factory, and it's been like that, oh, jeez, I don't know, Paul, how many years?

218
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:25,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost 10 years, I believe.

219
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,079
[SPEAKER_01]: The building is horrible looking.

220
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, and it's, let's be honest, I mean, it's huge property.

221
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,046
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big piece of property.

222
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:32,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

223
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:35,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end, the commercial street on the, uh,

224
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:39,680
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes all the way almost to the end of Riverside Avenue.

225
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,041
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole piece of property goes from Mr. Gallibert.

226
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:46,282
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of potential there.

227
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,762
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of commercial growth.

228
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:54,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even on the left-hand side, now that's all, I don't know what happened with that.

229
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:56,524
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gone, but it's empty.

230
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they pay less taxes.

231
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I mean, it's empty.

232
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:04,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from there is also gone.

233
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:22,854
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, I mean, when you look around, yeah, I could think of, like you said, you made me think of it, put it that way, but there is a lot of room for, you know, some good size stores, development, even what you mentioned earlier, you know, for kids and, yeah.

234
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,215
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot going on.

235
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:32,801
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did Medford, Malden, and Somerville, I believe, have a program for undeveloped children.

236
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:33,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yes.

237
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:34,723
[SPEAKER_00]: They just started.

238
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:36,284
[SPEAKER_01]: They started that recently.

239
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:37,265
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.

240
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:44,551
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we need to start focusing on our children and their education and things for them to do.

241
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:49,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had some of those things when I was younger.

242
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, well, we had things to do.

243
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:52,796
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.

244
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,617
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the movie theater.

245
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:57,038
[SPEAKER_01]: We had, uh, well, Papageno's.

246
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:57,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Papageno's.

247
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I worked at the movie theater.

248
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there you go.

249
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember the movie theater.

250
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:08,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had, we had quite a, you know, Woolworth's, uh, a lot of, a lot of things to do.

251
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,724
[SPEAKER_00]: And the square was always busy.

252
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:11,505
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a McDonald's in the square.

253
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,046
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't say to bring that type of,

254
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:15,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, no, I understand.

255
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:19,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the mom and pop, the Alamo, the nappies.

256
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:22,868
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some great cuisine and great restaurants in the city.

257
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:26,790
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to see chain restaurants like that come into the city.

258
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,511
[SPEAKER_00]: But more mom and pop stores would be nice.

259
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like they did in Somerville.

260
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:36,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to mention Assembly Road.

261
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,313
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.

262
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,014
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a lot of things but keep it like a

263
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:43,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the words are.

264
00:16:43,997 --> 00:17:02,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could describe it better than me, but I always think like, yeah, we want to grow, we want to, but I agree with you, small business, but down on Mystic Ave, and you mentioned where Cain's and all that, let's bring in a big lodge, or that's where you put up your 10, 15 stories, whatever.

265
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:03,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

266
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:04,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with.

267
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:05,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Housing and mixed use.

268
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:07,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can do a lot of different things.

269
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:08,717
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things can be done around there.

270
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense, yeah.

271
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:11,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

272
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,920
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting stuff you brought up.

273
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:22,403
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now let me get into my favorite things to ask people, the personal questions, okay?

274
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:33,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just gonna, I ask this of everybody, what is your least, your least and most favorite things to do in Method?

275
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:41,230
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been here a long time, and I don't, you know, if it's a small list, big list, but what is the least, what is the most favorite?

276
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, jeez.

277
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:47,506
[SPEAKER_00]: The least favorite thing to do in the city is right now to walk the streets.

278
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,107
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been walking the streets since I was a kid.

279
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:52,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

280
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:58,568
[SPEAKER_00]: But walking the streets right now, the sidewalks and streets are in deplorable condition.

281
00:17:59,168 --> 00:17:59,868
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dangerous.

282
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:00,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

283
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:04,989
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of ADA requirements that still aren't being met on a lot of streets.

284
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:05,609
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

285
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:10,510
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed overgrown trees that are ruining the sidewalks.

286
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,013
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all for the trees, Methods of Trees City, and I'm proud of it.

287
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:22,638
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to, I think, replace some of the trees of the roots that grow up and out.

288
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:24,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're up and over the sidewalk.

289
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:31,644
[SPEAKER_00]: And ruining our sidewalks to the new type of trees that grow down and don't disturb the sidewalks.

290
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:35,401
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great answer.

291
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:36,703
[SPEAKER_01]: The least favorite is to walk.

292
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.

293
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,008
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's true.

294
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:44,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I think, because I have a dog, I walk.

295
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down by the rink, you know, I'm on Walker Street.

296
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:49,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell you, it's tough over there, too.

297
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I think about it, like, you've got to really be looking down.

298
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:54,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you've got to pay attention when you're walking.

299
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:56,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you really do.

300
00:18:56,138 --> 00:19:01,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a lot of raised sidewalks and concrete and asphalt.

301
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:04,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's kind of a good answer.

302
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:05,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that answer, you know?

303
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:07,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's true, so.

304
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:10,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my favorite things to do in Medford?

305
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:13,512
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Medford is, without a doubt,

306
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Location, location, location.

307
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:19,769
[SPEAKER_00]: We are five to six miles from Boston.

308
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:31,840
[SPEAKER_00]: we're so lucky that we can hop into the North End, Chinatown, Government Center, State House, all of that stuff is right down the street.

309
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:37,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, location, location, location, everything in business, that's the first thing you look at is location.

310
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:50,055
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we have one of the greatest locations here in Medford, and some of the restaurants, the cuisine, everything we have here in Medford, it's family orientated.

311
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I hear you.

312
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:53,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.

313
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:55,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to keep it that way.

314
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:56,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

315
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:56,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

316
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:57,404
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I hear you.

317
00:19:57,724 --> 00:20:00,866
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I said big business, but not too big business.

318
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:01,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

319
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:01,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

320
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:15,355
[SPEAKER_01]: You're more or less like taking sections and doing... I'm not putting words in your mouth, but you're taking sections of the city and you're

321
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:21,764
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a good vision, I would say, for what needs to go in this section, this section.

322
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:24,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that.

323
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:28,649
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to just do the whole thing the same everywhere.

324
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:29,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at once.

325
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,892
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, I think that that's the problem.

326
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:35,894
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to do the zoning all at once.

327
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:42,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And the residents and the citizens of Medford need to digest one thing at a time.

328
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:43,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

329
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,181
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, like, Mystic Ave, again,

330
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,897
[SPEAKER_00]: The gateway to the city, that's our gateway to the city.

331
00:20:52,972 --> 00:21:10,461
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the infrastructure is fairly new on Mystic Ave, and can handle some big high-rise buildings, and it's not gonna take away sunlight and air rights from some of the neighborhoods that they're currently talking about.

332
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:21,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a single-family home, and I don't want a monstrosity next door to me that's gonna take away my sunlight and air rights.

333
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:24,910
[SPEAKER_00]: even though the planes fly over.

334
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want to see the numbers on those tails when they drive by.

335
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,937
[SPEAKER_01]: We all get that, I know.

336
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:33,199
[SPEAKER_01]: We all get the planes, whatever it is.

337
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,824
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like a week and then they go away for a couple and then they come back.

338
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I understand that.

339
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:56,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people that single families and you think about what they want to do and Yeah, I guess you could probably you could really do a job on a neighborhood You know doing it like that it just doesn't yeah, I

340
00:21:57,036 --> 00:22:13,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's South Medford, North Medford, East Medford, Wellington Glen, we have Hillside, West Medford, and I don't think people started to realize about the zoning until the word West Medford came out.

341
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,408
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that woke people up.

342
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:16,509
[SPEAKER_01]: It woke everybody up.

343
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:24,921
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Salem Street, unfortunately, got the brunt of it right now.

344
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:32,467
[SPEAKER_00]: But if a new council is elected, maybe we can bring back some of those things that they have changed.

345
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Make changes, but do them the right way.

346
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:36,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it the right way, and don't rush.

347
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,471
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no rush.

348
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:38,312
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no rush.

349
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:43,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Mystic Ave, the gateway to the city, start there.

350
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start in the neighborhoods.

351
00:22:45,356 --> 00:22:47,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start on the congested areas.

352
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:48,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Start on Mystic Avenue.

353
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,777
[SPEAKER_00]: We have plenty of room.

354
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:51,058
[SPEAKER_00]: You want housing?

355
00:22:51,778 --> 00:23:01,260
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be developers out there that would love to build a 14, 15-story building with mixed use and 10% affordable housing.

356
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can make some concessions to get them in there.

357
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:06,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

358
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not going to hurt the neighborhoods.

359
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:08,962
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to hurt the neighborhoods.

360
00:23:08,982 --> 00:23:10,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it makes sense.

361
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:10,742
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.

362
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:12,303
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that stuff would belong.

363
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:17,206
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I got one last question.

364
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:21,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone which is kind of important probably.

365
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:25,554
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone wants to reach out to you, Paul, get in touch with you.

366
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:27,536
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best way to do it?

367
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:28,477
[SPEAKER_01]: How would they do it?

368
00:23:28,497 --> 00:23:31,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a website or what's going on?

369
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,661
[SPEAKER_00]: We just set up a website.

370
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:36,224
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Donato, D-O-N-A-T-O, the number four.

371
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:37,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_00]: And my email address is Paul at Donato for medfit.com.

[SPEAKER_01]: Now for all the people watching it that are like me and I start to write something down and then I never finished.

377
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:54,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just repeat it one more time for them?

378
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:54,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

379
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:55,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

380

00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:07,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

383
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:11,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the show's going to come to an end.

384
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed talking with you.

385
00:24:13,344 --> 00:24:14,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I really did.

386
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:17,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you and your crew for having me here.

387
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:17,847
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice.

388
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:19,668
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed the conversation.

389
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:22,951
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I'm having a Saturday morning coffee with the guys.

390
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:24,292
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pleasant.

391
00:24:24,372 --> 00:24:25,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice conversation.

392
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:29,055

397
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:53,270
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot goes into running for city council, and it takes a lot to step up and do it.

398
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank you for that, Paul.
