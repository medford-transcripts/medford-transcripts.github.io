00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:18,282
Hi everyone and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Method.

2
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:20,866
I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:30,329
The purpose of this program is to give Meffitt citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:38,752
And our guest for today's show is Paul Donato, Jr., candidate for our Meffitt City Council.

5
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:41,533
Paul, welcome to Meffitt Happenings.

6
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:44,614
John, thank you and crew for having me here today.

7
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:45,775
Our pleasure.

8
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:49,059
We're going to start right off, Paul.

9
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:51,121
We're just going to go right into questions here.

10
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:57,048
So what we normally do, first question, just tell us a little bit about yourself.

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,492
Who is Paul Donato, Jr.? ?

12
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:03,196
So my name is Paul Donato, Jr.

13
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:05,338
I'm a lifelong Medford resident.

14
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:07,719
I was born here at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,721
I've never left.

16
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:16,605
I attended Medford High School and Davenport School, Roberts Junior High.

17
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,926
I've been all over the city.

18
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:19,868
So the whole thing, you... Yes.

19
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:27,471
Part of my work history is I'm in the hospitality industry, catering and concessions.

20
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:34,774
If you come by the farmer's market on Thursdays, you'll probably bump into me and my children selling Italian ice.

21
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:37,375
Yeah, you do a good job with that, too, by the way.

22
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:38,015
Thank you very much.

23
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:39,836
Yeah, you really do.

24
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:42,517
So you're a lifelong Method resident.

25
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:43,277
Yes.

26
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:44,698
Good to know.

27
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,000
So what are the reasons

28
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,428
I mean, thank you for running for council.

29
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:53,790
We appreciate it.

30
00:01:54,371 --> 00:02:00,039
But what are the reasons making you run for Medford City Council?

31
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,081
I mean, why do you want the job, Paul?

32
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:07,809
The reason why I want the job is I want to be the voice for the people of the citizens of Medford that aren't being heard.

33
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:16,981
There's a lot of people out there that they don't have this, they don't have an opportunity to be heard.

34
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:21,465
And I just want to be that person to represent the people of Medford.

35
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:26,069
To put out information, listen to the people, do what the people want.

36
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,109
Yes, that's correct.

37
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,533
There's a lot of stuff going on that people need to know about.

38
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,115
Okay, do you want to get into what's going on?

39
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:37,278
I mean, a few things maybe?

40
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:38,784
Charter change.

41
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:39,845
Okay.

42
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:41,186
That was a big one.

43
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:41,966
That was huge.

44
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:42,346
Yes.

45
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:48,289
I don't agree with a lot of things that's happening.

46
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:53,052
Zoning, taxes, cost of living, the infrastructure and roads.

47
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:56,753
Yep.

48
00:02:57,314 --> 00:03:00,976
And I think a lot of people agree with you, Paul, because the roads.

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,921
Yeah, the roads, the infrastructure, yeah.

50
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:09,383
There's a lot of people listening and watching that are going to agree with that.

51
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:15,505
So, you know, some of those are good reasons.

52
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:20,227
You know, as a council, let's say you get on the council, you become a council member.

53
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:22,108
Any solutions?

54
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:27,030
I mean, what do you look to do to resolve all these issues?

55
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,271
In my opinion, Mr. Gabb is the gateway to the city.

56
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:31,488
Okay.

57
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:42,912
And about 35 years ago, people on the council had an idea to change Mystic Ave and it was outvoted and it didn't happen.

58
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:47,694
And I believe that that is where we should start.

59
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:53,917
We should focus our attention on Mystic Ave commercial and industrial zoning.

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:17,314
high-rises we have that whole side of uh... ninety-three right that we could put high-rises and mixed-use pedestrian walkways and bear garden things that uh... we deserve not only for us but bring some other people into it

61
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:24,404
So why, I mean, do you see any steps?

62
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:31,409
I mean, what's this, the current people running the city, do you see, I mean, what do you see getting done?

63
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:39,655
Do you see any steps being taken as far as, you know, Mystic Ave is a great one, the squares, I mean, what do you see?

64
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:46,399
So I don't think that the focus should be on neighborhoods and residentials at this time.

65
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,080
Okay.

66
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,801
I think that we should focus on our commercial.

67
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:52,843
We have Cane's Potato, the old Cane's Potato Chips, GE.

68
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:55,004
Oh yeah, I forgot all about that.

69
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:55,744
Cane's, yeah.

70
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:57,905
Cane's Potato Chips, GE.

71
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:00,026
I mean, there's high-rise buildings there.

72
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:11,392
You can build as high as you want, or 14 stories, 30, whatever it may be, and it's not gonna take away sunlight and ruin the neighborhoods that we currently have.

73
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:12,593
People move to this city,

74
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:22,599
years ago in the 50s and 60s because of the neighborhood feel and the The comfortability of knowing your neighbors and I don't think that's happening anymore.

75
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:32,586
I think that If they try to change the zoning in the neighborhoods It's gonna ruin some of that feel Yep.

76
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:33,606
I hear you.

77
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:42,092
Yeah, I don't want to see that in my yeah, no, I mean I I agree I agree with that I mean it seems like they're

78
00:05:44,605 --> 00:06:13,565
you know they're focusing on parts of the city it's all residential and what they need to focus on i agree is the squares mystic ave so much that potential that we have here in the city that uh... we're not using right now those sites have been empty for a long time on mystic valley parkway you want housing that's the perfect place to start so i mean

79
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,031
Basically, my next question, I was going to follow up on the zoning.

80
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:23,233
We're discussing it.

81
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:25,154
We're talking about what your opinions are.

82
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,396
I think you covered it all, really.

83
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,737
So roads and infrastructure.

84
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:31,357
Right.

85
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:34,359
You can't put Band-Aids on the streets right now.

86
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:35,039
OK.

87
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,160
We need billions of dollars.

88
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:40,482
Not millions, we need billions.

89
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:41,882
So we've heard, yes.

90
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:42,703
Billions of dollars.

91
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,384
And I don't think that they should be just patching up roads.

92
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,385
Let's start in the bottom.

93
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:53,087
Let's put in new gas lines, water lines, sewer lines.

94
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,888
While we're at it, cable and electric.

95
00:06:56,248 --> 00:07:02,690
I think that they could, you know, if they're digging up the streets and the streets open, let's move the pipes underground.

96
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,190
Right.

97
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:03,830
Right.

98
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,671
So this way we can

99
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:08,053
protect ourselves from future storms.

100
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:13,076
I mean, we haven't really had any snow or some serious storms.

101
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:14,196
We have been lucky.

102
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:19,139
But we don't know what's going to happen 25, 50, 100 years from now.

103
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,121
The infrastructure is over 100 years old.

104
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:30,106
And I believe that we need to start there and getting some of the funds from the electric and the gas companies.

105
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:31,807
And we'll let them pay for it.

106
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:41,037
I know that when you dig up the street, they should be doing curb to curb.

107
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:43,279
Pat's work.

108
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,222
Yeah, no, I hear you on that.

109
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:53,990
And I'm only laughing because we all know, I mean, we've seen it, oh, I can name a dozen, Winthrop Street, I mean, all over the place.

110
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:58,853
where they come, I mean they do, they'll go up the length of a street.

111
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:01,133
Willis Ave, they're doing stuff right now.

112
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,973
I don't know how that's gonna end up coming out.

113
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:10,054
In my study that I've been doing, the city of Medford does about 10 streets a year, complete streets.

114
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:10,635
Okay.

115
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:17,996
And I think that we need to have a 10 year program and we need to build it up to 30 streets, to 40 streets a year.

116
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:18,536
Okay.

117
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:21,336
In order to get to that 10 to 15 year goal.

118
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:23,257
All right, yeah.

119
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:24,577
To fix all of our streets.

120
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:27,137
It's a plan, yeah.

121
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:32,339
Let the electric company and gas company pay for some of that infrastructure repair.

122
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,879
They're the ones that are digging up our streets after it's just repaved.

123
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:38,900
You just mentioned Winthrop Street, they repaved it.

124
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,180
How many times?

125
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,621
Three or four times they had to cut it up, open it, and start again.

126
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,302
Yeah, I know some people that live up there, they weren't too happy.

127
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:48,522
It just kept, it was like,

128
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,554
The ongoing saga never ending digging.

129
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:53,816
Yeah, that's what it seemed like.

130
00:08:53,836 --> 00:09:03,409
Yeah, but uh, yeah, you know great answer, uh Yeah, it makes sense to to sort of do it all at once get it done do it right and while you're open

131
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:05,893
That's a novel idea.

132
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:08,095
Fix everything at the same time.

133
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,216
And then move on.

134
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:10,277
A little bit at a time.

135
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:12,259
Now we're going to get into economic development.

136
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:29,978
In this city, anyhow, I mean, it's stagnant at best.

137
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:33,160
We just haven't, you know, and I don't know what the reasons are.

138
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,900
I have no idea what's going on.

139
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,762
But you mentioned Mr. Gav.

140
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:40,663
There's so much potential.

141
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:44,785
But anyhow, what are you going to do to get?

142
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:48,847
Well, I know the current council voted to change Salem Street.

143
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,448
We can start with that if you'd like.

144
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:50,748
Right.

145
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:51,188
Yeah.

146
00:09:52,187 --> 00:10:00,871
I think that if a new council is elected, we can bring back some of those ordinances and things that they have changed.

147
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:09,074
If we can change the council, we can change some of the things that they have brought forward.

148
00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:12,676
I know you're talking about this, but I don't think the council should be talking about

149
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,584
issues not in the city of Medford.

150
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:17,424
Okay.

151
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:18,064
Right?

152
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:23,965
I know we didn't bring it up, but... Yeah, no, it's... I mean, yeah, I mean... Let's focus on what's going on in our city.

153
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:24,706
Okay.

154
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:30,267
It's not that I'm concerned about what's going on in other parts of the country and in the world.

155
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:31,567
We all are, right.

156
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,268
But right now, Medford needs us.

157
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:35,068
Yep.

158
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:43,562
And let's focus on Medford before we start focusing on the rest of the country and the world right now, in my opinion.

159
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:49,523
Yeah, no, that makes perfect sense, because there are a lot of issues in Medford.

160
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:51,703
We discussed some.

161
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:56,585
Parking, there's so many issues that we could talk about.

162
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:59,745
And the zoning, I don't know how you feel about it.

163
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:02,906
I'm going to get back to it, but it just seems like it's

164
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,680
It's just being pushed.

165
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,863
It's not even a question of, it's just like being forced.

166
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:14,426
You're gonna take this, we're gonna build or do whatever with these lots.

167
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:18,869
It's confusing to people, it's complicated.

168
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,090
The people need to be informed.

169
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,132
They're not being informed properly.

170
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:28,677
Robocalls, brochures, let's, if we're gonna do this, let's do it right.

171
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:30,078
Let's not rush it.

172
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:36,662
Yeah, yeah, I mean just like the charter change it took the charter change was in process for 10 years, right?

173
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:41,885
It took the charter commission two years to come up with a plan And they came up with a great plan.

174
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,706
I thought so they came up with a great.

175
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,648
I thought so at the last minute

176
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,529
There was some doors, backdoor deal or whatever.

177
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,590
Yeah, something happened because it got changed.

178
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,411
Or they tried to change it.

179
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:53,531
They tried to change it.

180
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,552
And thank God the mayor stepped up.

181
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:56,112
Right.

182
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,394
And at the last minute she conceded to a few things.

183
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:00,974
Right.

184
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:05,256
And I think that she did a great job by keeping ward representation.

185
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:08,537
And hopefully it passes the legislature.

186
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:09,038
Yeah, so.

187
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:16,027
Yeah, she definitely, what we would say in the old days, I say the old days, but she told the line for us.

188
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:16,768
She really did.

189
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:17,208
She did.

190
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:18,270
When it came to that.

191
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,732
She held her ground.

192
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:20,854
She did hold her ground.

193
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:22,135
She did a good job.

194
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,561
talking about a lot of good stuff.

195
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:30,943
I like what you're saying.

196
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:31,583
I do.

197
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:33,424
No, I like what you're saying.

198
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:35,025
It's interesting.

199
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:40,588
So this is kind of like a general question, okay?

200
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:41,809
What

201
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:48,038
What do you see for the future of Method?

202
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:50,879
What do you envision?

203
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:54,299
Let's bring in some big-name companies.

204
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,040
Right now the mayor is looking at Budweiser for Market Basket.

205
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,722
If Market Basket doesn't work, they have their own internal problems going on right now.

206
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:30,194
my opinion again this is my opinion with uh... encore and everything that's going on and they're trying to build a soccer stadium there's nothing for families and children to do okay in that area and i believe that uh... something like just throwing it out there a great wolf lodge something for families that you know

207
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:35,959
We can get a good tax break from a big hotel chain like that to come in.

208
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:37,500
That's a perfect location.

209
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,784
Indoor activities, something for families to do.

210
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:46,467
Grandchildren, children of all ages can go in there and enjoy themselves.

211
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:53,293
I really do hope that the mayor and everybody can get together and bring in a market basket.

212
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:58,317
But if that fails, that's just something I'm throwing out there, in my opinion.

213
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:01,679
big business is what we need.

214
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,703
And I'm going to say, at the beginning of the conversation, I drive around the city all the time.

215
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:12,747
You made some great points because I live down, I'm on Windsor, so.

216
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:13,347
Oh, okay.

217
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:23,354
Yeah, and I drive by the old Canes factory, and it's been like that, oh, jeez, I don't know, Paul, how many years?

218
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:25,175
Almost 10 years, I believe.

219
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,079
The building is horrible looking.

220
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,784
It's, and it's, let's be honest, I mean, it's huge property.

221
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,046
It's a big piece of property.

222
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:32,307
Yeah.

223
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:35,512
And then at the end, the commercial street on the, uh,

224
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:39,680
It goes all the way almost to the end of Riverside Avenue.

225
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,041
That whole piece of property goes from Mr. Gallibert.

226
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:46,282
There's a lot of potential there.

227
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,762
A lot of commercial growth.

228
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:54,144
And then even on the left-hand side, now that's all, I don't know what happened with that.

229
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:56,524
That's gone, but it's empty.

230
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,305
Of course, they pay less taxes.

231
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,786
Yeah, no, I mean, it's empty.

232
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:04,127
Everything from there is also gone.

233
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:22,854
So, but yeah, I mean, when you look around, yeah, I could think of, like you said, you made me think of it, put it that way, but there is a lot of room for, you know, some good size stores, development, even what you mentioned earlier, you know, for kids and, yeah.

234
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,215
I mean, there's a lot going on.

235
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:32,801
We just did Medford, Malden, and Somerville, I believe, have a program for undeveloped children.

236
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:33,662
Right, yes.

237
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:34,723
They just started.

238
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:36,284
They started that recently.

239
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:37,265
That's correct.

240
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:44,551
And I think that we need to start focusing on our children and their education and things for them to do.

241
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:49,955
I wish I had some of those things when I was younger.

242
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,196
Yeah, I mean, well, we had things to do.

243
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:52,796
We did.

244
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,617
We had the movie theater.

245
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:57,038
We had, uh, well, Papageno's.

246
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:57,738
Papageno's.

247
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,919
Actually, I worked at the movie theater.

248
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,800
Yeah, so there you go.

249
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,881
Yeah, I remember the movie theater.

250
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:08,143
And then we had, we had quite a, you know, Woolworth's, uh, a lot of, a lot of things to do.

251
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,724
And the square was always busy.

252
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:11,505
There was a McDonald's in the square.

253
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,046
I don't say to bring that type of,

254
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:15,406
Right, no, I understand.

255
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:19,147
I like the mom and pop, the Alamo, the nappies.

256
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:22,868
We have some great cuisine and great restaurants in the city.

257
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:26,790
I don't want to see chain restaurants like that come into the city.

258
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,511
But more mom and pop stores would be nice.

259
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,012
Just like they did in Somerville.

260
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:36,512
I'm not going to mention Assembly Road.

261
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,313
No, I know.

262
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,014
You can do a lot of things but keep it like a

263
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:43,897
I don't know what the words are.

264
00:16:43,997 --> 00:17:02,812
Maybe you could describe it better than me, but I always think like, yeah, we want to grow, we want to, but I agree with you, small business, but down on Mystic Ave, and you mentioned where Cain's and all that, let's bring in a big lodge, or that's where you put up your 10, 15 stories, whatever.

265
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:03,292
Correct.

266
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:04,653
Yeah, with.

267
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:05,894
Housing and mixed use.

268
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:07,195
Yeah, you can do a lot of different things.

269
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:08,717
There's a lot of things can be done around there.

270
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,378
Yeah, that makes sense, yeah.

271
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:11,279
Yeah.

272
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,920
That's interesting stuff you brought up.

273
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:22,403
All right, so now let me get into my favorite things to ask people, the personal questions, okay?

274
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:33,947
I'm just gonna, I ask this of everybody, what is your least, your least and most favorite things to do in Method?

275
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:41,230
You've been here a long time, and I don't, you know, if it's a small list, big list, but what is the least, what is the most favorite?

276
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,165
Oh, jeez.

277
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:47,506
The least favorite thing to do in the city is right now to walk the streets.

278
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,107
I've been walking the streets since I was a kid.

279
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:52,607
Right.

280
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:58,568
But walking the streets right now, the sidewalks and streets are in deplorable condition.

281
00:17:59,168 --> 00:17:59,868
It's dangerous.

282
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:00,368
Yeah.

283
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:04,989
A lot of ADA requirements that still aren't being met on a lot of streets.

284
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:05,609
OK.

285
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:10,510
I've noticed overgrown trees that are ruining the sidewalks.

286
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,013
And I'm all for the trees, Methods of Trees City, and I'm proud of it.

287
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:22,638
But we have to, I think, replace some of the trees of the roots that grow up and out.

288
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:24,019
Yeah, they're up and over the sidewalk.

289
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:31,644
And ruining our sidewalks to the new type of trees that grow down and don't disturb the sidewalks.

290
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:35,401
That's a great answer.

291
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:36,703
The least favorite is to walk.

292
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,245
Oh my goodness.

293
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,008
No, it's true.

294
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:44,454
Now that I think, because I have a dog, I walk.

295
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,937
I'm down by the rink, you know, I'm on Walker Street.

296
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:49,974
And I tell you, it's tough over there, too.

297
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,936
Now that I think about it, like, you've got to really be looking down.

298
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:54,837
Yeah, you've got to pay attention when you're walking.

299
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:56,038
Yeah, you really do.

300
00:18:56,138 --> 00:19:01,963
Yeah, it's a lot of raised sidewalks and concrete and asphalt.

301
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:04,305
Yeah, that's kind of a good answer.

302
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:05,786
I like that answer, you know?

303
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:07,687
And it's true, so.

304
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:10,249
Some of my favorite things to do in Medford?

305
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:13,512
So, Medford is, without a doubt,

306
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,584
Location, location, location.

307
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:19,769
We are five to six miles from Boston.

308
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:31,840
we're so lucky that we can hop into the North End, Chinatown, Government Center, State House, all of that stuff is right down the street.

309
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:37,765
Like I said, location, location, location, everything in business, that's the first thing you look at is location.

310
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:50,055
And I think that we have one of the greatest locations here in Medford, and some of the restaurants, the cuisine, everything we have here in Medford, it's family orientated.

311
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,821
Yeah, no, I hear you.

312
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:53,501
I hear you.

313
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:55,483
And we want to keep it that way.

314
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:56,263
Absolutely.

315
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:56,483
Yeah.

316
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:57,404
No, I hear you.

317
00:19:57,724 --> 00:20:00,866
So that's why I said big business, but not too big business.

318
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:01,126
Right.

319
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:01,846
Yeah.

320
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:15,355
You're more or less like taking sections and doing... I'm not putting words in your mouth, but you're taking sections of the city and you're

321
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:21,764
You got a good vision, I would say, for what needs to go in this section, this section.

322
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:24,186
And I like that.

323
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:28,649
We're not going to just do the whole thing the same everywhere.

324
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:29,850
Or at once.

325
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,892
And right now, I think that that's the problem.

326
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:35,894
They're trying to do the zoning all at once.

327
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:42,819
And the residents and the citizens of Medford need to digest one thing at a time.

328
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:43,299
Right.

329
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,181
So let's, like, Mystic Ave, again,

330
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,897
The gateway to the city, that's our gateway to the city.

331
00:20:52,972 --> 00:21:10,461
We know that the infrastructure is fairly new on Mystic Ave, and can handle some big high-rise buildings, and it's not gonna take away sunlight and air rights from some of the neighborhoods that they're currently talking about.

332
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:21,286
I have a single-family home, and I don't want a monstrosity next door to me that's gonna take away my sunlight and air rights.

333
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:24,910
even though the planes fly over.

334
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,955
I still want to see the numbers on those tails when they drive by.

335
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,937
We all get that, I know.

336
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:33,199
We all get the planes, whatever it is.

337
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,824
It seems like a week and then they go away for a couple and then they come back.

338
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,086
Yeah, no, I understand that.

339
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:56,716
I know a lot of people that single families and you think about what they want to do and Yeah, I guess you could probably you could really do a job on a neighborhood You know doing it like that it just doesn't yeah, I

340
00:21:57,036 --> 00:22:13,207
Yeah, that's South Medford, North Medford, East Medford, Wellington Glen, we have Hillside, West Medford, and I don't think people started to realize about the zoning until the word West Medford came out.

341
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,408
And then that woke people up.

342
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:16,509
It woke everybody up.

343
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:24,921
I think that Salem Street, unfortunately, got the brunt of it right now.

344
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:32,467
But if a new council is elected, maybe we can bring back some of those things that they have changed.

345
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,589
Make changes, but do them the right way.

346
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:36,230
Do it the right way, and don't rush.

347
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,471
There's no rush.

348
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:38,312
There's no rush.

349
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:43,235
Again, Mystic Ave, the gateway to the city, start there.

350
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,296
Don't start in the neighborhoods.

351
00:22:45,356 --> 00:22:47,177
Don't start on the congested areas.

352
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:48,597
Start on Mystic Avenue.

353
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,777
We have plenty of room.

354
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:51,058
You want housing?

355
00:22:51,778 --> 00:23:01,260
There's got to be developers out there that would love to build a 14, 15-story building with mixed use and 10% affordable housing.

356
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,701
I mean, we can make some concessions to get them in there.

357
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:06,081
Right.

358
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,401
And it's not going to hurt the neighborhoods.

359
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:08,962
It's not going to hurt the neighborhoods.

360
00:23:08,982 --> 00:23:10,002
Yeah, no, it makes sense.

361
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:10,742
It makes sense.

362
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:12,303
That's where that stuff would belong.

363
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:17,206
All right, so I got one last question.

364
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:21,771
Someone which is kind of important probably.

365
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:25,554
If someone wants to reach out to you, Paul, get in touch with you.

366
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:27,536
What's the best way to do it?

367
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:28,477
How would they do it?

368
00:23:28,497 --> 00:23:31,400
Do you have a website or what's going on?

369
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,661
We just set up a website.

370
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:36,224
It's Donato, D-O-N-A-T-O, the number four.

371
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:37,407
Okay.

372
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:39,048
Uh, dot com.

373
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:39,688
All right.

374
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:44,869
And my email address is Paul at Donato for medfit.com.

375
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:45,389
Okay.

376
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:52,651
Now for all the people watching it that are like me and I start to write something down and then I never finished.

377
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:54,452
Can you just repeat it one more time for them?

378
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:54,932
Yes.

379
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:55,392
I'm sorry.

380
00:23:55,532 --> 00:24:05,575
Paul, P-A-U-L at Donato, D-O-N-A-T-O, the number for medfit, M-E-D-F-O-R-D dot com.

381
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:06,359
Great.

382
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:07,660
Excellent.

383
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:11,963
Unfortunately, the show's going to come to an end.

384
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,284
I enjoyed talking with you.

385
00:24:13,344 --> 00:24:14,004
I really did.

386
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:17,247
I appreciate you and your crew for having me here.

387
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:17,847
It was nice.

388
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:19,668
I enjoyed the conversation.

389
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:22,951
It's like I'm having a Saturday morning coffee with the guys.

390
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:24,292
It was pleasant.

391
00:24:24,372 --> 00:24:25,672
Nice conversation.

392
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:29,055
And a lot of good points were brought out, I think.

393
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:31,136
So I want to thank

394
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:36,645
Mr. Paul J. Donato Jr.

395
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,566
again for joining us on Method Happenings.

396
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:46,028
And secondly, I want to thank him for being a candidate for a Method City Council.

397
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:53,270
A lot goes into running for city council, and it takes a lot to step up and do it.

398
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,291
So I want to thank you for that, Paul.

399
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:59,292
I also want to take a minute to thank everyone

400
00:24:59,992 --> 00:25:01,474
who has been watching the show.

401
00:25:01,494 --> 00:25:04,157
I want to thank you for the feedback.

402
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:08,884
You know, we get positive, negative, we'll take it all.

403
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:16,313
The other thing is if you would like to share a comment, if you are a candidate

404
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:36,751
for any city office, you're running for re-election, if you're opening a new business, if you'd like to open a new business, if you have an existing business, you represent an organization with an upcoming event, would like to appear on a future show,

405
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:41,748

But I want to thank everyone for watching.

413
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,654
