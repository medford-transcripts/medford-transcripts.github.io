Welcome back to our next edition of Coffee Chats with Kingsley's.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,612
My special guest is going to introduce herself today.

3
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:12,495
Hello, my name is Caroline Kingsley.

4
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:15,898
I go to the Brooks School and I am in second grade.

5
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,920
What are we talking about today, Caroline?

6
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,643
Strategic plans.

7
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:22,145
What's a strategic plan?

8
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:24,087
I don't know.

9
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:30,321
No.

10
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:32,082
What is a strategic plan?

11
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:37,323
So when you start doing something, do you have a plan beforehand?

12
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:40,764
Yes.

13
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:43,545
Sometimes yes, sometimes no, or always?

14
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,827
I usually have like based on kind of.

15
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:49,987
Yeah.

16
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:53,409
So the same thing should be true for our schools.

17
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:57,850
So if you're running a school district or a company or something,

18
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:08,462
Kind of knowing the basics of what you wanna do before you get started helps you do it in a way that makes more sense and that's easier.

19
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:17,528
Does that make sense?

20
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,731
What do you think would happen if you try to do something without a plan?

21
00:01:24,313 --> 00:01:25,894
You might mess up and like,

22
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,009
Like, bomb the whole thing?

23
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:30,690
Yeah.

24
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,051
Mess up the whole thing?

25
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:49,369
Right, and we don't want to mess up the whole school district, so we're going to create a plan.

26
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:08,385
Okay, thank you for coming to Coffee Chats with the Kingsley's.

27
00:02:08,886 --> 00:02:09,969
Cheers out, people!
