    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9.043s">12th</a>  regular meeting of the Medford City Council will call, come to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=13.467s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=30.562s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=39.074s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=62.744s">Mr.</a>  President, I move suspension of the fools to allow a citizen to speak as it relates to her concern.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=74.992s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=76.053s">My</a>  name is Elsie Ashworth, and I own a hair salon at 75 Riverside Avenue, Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=82.638s">It's</a>  on the side of the municipal lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=85.901s">After</a>  27 years at this location, myself and my customers had never been subjected to pay to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=93.607s">It</a>  is today a fact in many cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=97.411s">It</a>  takes adjustments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=99.132s">However,</a>  it was put in at the worst time of the year, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=103.2s">in</a>  the middle of three terrible snowstorms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=107.223s">I</a>  think it was put in without thought and much consideration, with a plan which was imperfect and had so many errors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=118.75s">Try</a>  as you go, I call it, the merchants and business owners were burdened with additional work, teaching people how to run the kiosks, keeping change on hand, assisting the elderly, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=132.526s">In</a>  a snowstorm, frustrated, I called the mayor's office and said to Linda, am I asked to shovel the kiosks out also? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=143.754s">My</a>  client cannot reach it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=146.036s">She</a>  said, and this was terrible, have her walk to the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=152.721s">Now,</a>  she was in her 80s with a cane. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=155.563s">If</a>  there had been better communication between pay to park and the merchants, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=161.494s">we</a>  would have known they did not have to pay in a snowstorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=165.655s">Now</a>  I have pictures on my iPhone showing the clients with wet hair, full of hair color, standing in the snow in 10-degree weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=180.639s">By</a>  the way, the color on her hair was affected by the cold, and I had to redo it for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=189.797s">Now</a>  I have kept many notes for months and things have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=193.12s">Winter</a>  is gone, spring in here, and the pay to park is not going to disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=199.365s">I</a>  have condensed and rewritten my notes over the months because I realize some of the fear is because there's very little information and it is so confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=210.053s">I</a>  have spoken to pay to park, the mayor's office, the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=216.078s">I</a>  find what is so today <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=218.524s">is</a>  changed tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=220.325s">Kiosks</a>  are not probed and not kept into date. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=223.986s">They</a>  are not in tune with what we were told. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=229.368s">I</a>  ask for pay to park and the city officials to get their act together so that we can all be informed and be on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=239.812s">My</a>  staff and I have paid the $100 fee to be able to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=245.183s">and</a>  we continue to be harassed with tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=248.486s">Myself,</a>  with a handicap ticket, I have gotten three tickets and I have to take time out of my busy life to go to the pay-to-park office and straighten it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=260.396s">Questions</a>  need to be answered and made publicly known. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=264.539s">However,</a>  in the newspaper, at the senior center, perhaps a letter to the editor of the transcript, we need to be educated and told <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=274.715s">what</a>  to do and what not to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=277.177s">Questions</a>  need to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=279.638s">Some</a>  questions about the kiosks continued to be asked of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=284.761s">Let's</a>  say someone puts 50 cents in for half an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=288.624s">Can</a>  they add more money? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=291.526s">Will</a>  the kiosk recognize the change? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=295.768s">Question</a>  two. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=297.55s">It's</a>  been told we are now to park three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=300.912s">It</a>  has changed from two hours to three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=304.114s">Well,</a>  when will the kiosks recognize this and can it be done in one transaction? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=311.738s">Question</a>  three. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=313.759s">Now</a>  from two to three hours, can we park the car and go through this without moving the car, which we have been told? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=322.324s">It's</a>  crazy to have to come out of a business <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=325.962s">a</a>  manicurist, a hairdresser, a dentist, and have to move a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=331.384s">In</a>  the municipal lot, it is not too hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=334.585s">There's</a>  always another space. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=336.605s">But</a>  what happens on High Street, Salem Street, Riverside Ave, move the car, lose your space, tough luck, there may not be another one available. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=347.349s">There</a>  are also many rumors out there that upset my employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=351.873s">And</a>  these might just be rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=354.135s">That</a>  is that next year, it will be $400 for permits for employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=360.54s">I</a>  would lose most of my help as they are part-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=364.303s">Again,</a>  I say, these are rumors, but why not let it be clear to what's going on next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=370.769s">Even</a>  the transcript said tokens may be available to merchants. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=376.08s">to</a>  buy at discount prices to hand out to their customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=381.503s">We're</a>  not meter maids. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=382.824s">We</a>  have enough on our plate to take care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=385.646s">Thank</a>  you for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=387.287s">This</a>  has been a real problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=388.968s">It</a>  has affected business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=390.929s">It</a>  has affected the feelings Medford citizens have about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=395.952s">We</a>  love Medford, but we have been really, you know, in a tough way to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=401.955s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=403.216s">Thank</a>  you very much for coming up, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=405.798s">And</a>  please know that the council hears your concerns, and that we have been working to get the record straight on many of your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=422.587s">And</a>  in two weeks, we'll have a Committee of the Whole meeting with the Traffic Commission, which has authority over the new parking program, to have them report back to us <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=433.849s">on</a>  some of the changes that they've made and to hear some of our additional concerns regarding all those matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=443.518s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=445.24s">Elsie,</a>  could you just come? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=447.322s">Could</a>  you come up please? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=448.703s">Councilor</a>  Penta has a question for you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=451.947s">You</a>  made a comment that related to the fact that you have a handicap placard and you've been tagged three times?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=457.832s">Yes,</a>  three times.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=459.0s">And</a>  you, did you relate that to the chief of police?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=461.001s">Well,</a>  one time I was tagged out, uh, probably in January, my handicap, uh, ticket was up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=468.424s">Uh,</a>  I went to the pay to park office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=470.465s">It</a>  was ironed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=472.065s">I</a>  got one again last Friday, went up yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=475.827s">And</a>  when, uh, the lady, a very nice lady called Pam looked up the records, she excused that, uh, Friday ticket, but she also saw that I got one on February 14th, which I was not aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=489.179s">The</a>  ticket had gone up from $25 now to $50 because it was not paid in 21 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=495.721s">I</a>  said to her, had I known I had a ticket, I would have been right up here just like I was for the ticket I thought that I got last Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=504.163s">Well,</a>  I didn't know about the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=506.323s">You</a>  know, they're lightweight, they weigh what, same weight as you get on a stopping shop, you know, receipt, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=516.752s">And</a>  in that weather, it could have been blown away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=519.535s">I</a>  could have scraped it off with moving the snow off the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=524.519s">I</a>  was not aware of it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=526.12s">This</a>  is, Mr. President, and anyone who might be listening, this is just symptomatic as to what's going on with Republic's attitude here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=533.426s">We</a>  have a resolution further on into the agenda that will address some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=538.271s">But</a>  attacking a person, so to speak, with a handicapped spot <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=543.782s">These</a>  people, it's obvious that they're not trained properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=547.003s">They're</a>  out-of-towners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=548.243s">As</a>  far as I'm concerned, they're bounty hunters. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=550.124s">They're</a>  just coming in here to make as much money as they can at the expense of the taxpayers and small business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=555.185s">So,</a>  when we get to this conversation, Mr. President, as I asked you before, when we have our meeting in some two weeks, this is a serious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=563.107s">Tagging</a>  people, especially people that have a handicapped placard, that's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=567.187s">And</a>  that shows a complete dereliction of somebody's duty to their job, knowing who they should tag and who they shouldn't tag. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=574.114s">So</a>  I thank you for bringing that forward.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=575.676s">Well,</a>  I've seen many different fellows out there in the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=580.221s">I</a>  wish they were Medford citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=581.722s">I'd</a>  like our money to go to Medford citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=584.285s">So</a>  I see that this program pays. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=586.677s">for</a>  so many outsiders to get a paycheck. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=589.379s">And</a>  it's at the, you know, it's the merchants and the citizens that are paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=594.162s">And</a>  I wish, I truly wish a lot more money would go to Medford so we can see the results and everybody, commons who comes to the salon. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=603.708s">But</a>  we really feel under the gun all the time in the shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=608.991s">We're</a>  constantly monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=610.913s">Did</a>  you pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=611.633s">Did</a>  you pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=612.194s">Have</a>  you paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=613.221s">we're</a>  out there assisting, you know, we've become an accomplice to not getting paid for it either. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=619.746s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=620.586s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=621.127s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=622.448s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=623.628s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Penta to receive and place on file or refer to the committee of the whole meeting for two weeks hence. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=630.493s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=630.713s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=632.134s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=636.558s">Additionally,</a>  Mr. President, this council has been on record on several occasions requesting that <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=643.062s">Republic</a>  be able to turn off the machines when they're not supposed to be in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=649.206s">And</a>  I know just recently we voted unanimously to have that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=652.749s">The</a>  hours of operation now are 8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=656.472s">to</a>  6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=658.353s">And</a>  these machines are accepting money prior to 8 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=661.755s">and</a>  after 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=663.597s">We</a>  met tonight for a community block grant public service proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=669.148s">And</a>  one of the human service agencies, the Consumer Advisory Commission, came before us for additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=677.329s">And</a>  I mentioned to the director of the program that this issue with the kiosk has been a long, ongoing issue and something that they should review. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=688.411s">And</a>  I ask that this council go on record and send a letter to the Consumer Advisory Commission asking if they can intervene on behalf of every Medford resident <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=699.368s">to</a>  make sure these machines are not capable of accepting money before or after the hours of operation, and also that it's publicly posted throughout the community what the exact hours of operation are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=711.958s">It's</a>  very misrepresenting for residents that are trying to do business in the square to try to figure out whether or not they have to pay the kiosk, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=722.506s">And</a>  I would ask that in the form of a motion tonight, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=725.848s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=726.348s">So</a>  on the motion of council, Penter as amended by Councilor Marks, council Longo current.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=731.07s">Thank</a>  you, president Delaware. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=731.99s">So</a>  you, so we're having a meeting on the 21st, Tuesday, the 21st, 22nd, Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=737.953s">What</a>  time?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=738.913s">I</a>  think we're calling it for six to seven 30 and the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=743.275s">Uh,</a>  the, uh, clerk is going to announce that, uh, Pence, but I'm told that all the department heads, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=749.841s">have</a>  already received the notifications.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=751.802s">Yeah,</a>  I hope Republic's present. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=753.863s">I</a>  just, I feel like that is almost.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=756.025s">They</a>  were requested to be part of that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=758.186s">It's</a>  not soon enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=759.447s">Within</a>  the last few days, I've got complaints with regards to Council Pentis concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=763.669s">Still</a>  no signage on the vehicles that are handing out the tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=768.051s">I've</a>  got complaints about people waiting in line to pay the parking meter and turn around and they have a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=775.756s">And</a>  I've had people who are getting ticketed <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=778.521s">after</a>  they already paid within the time frame that's allowable for them to be parked in the proper parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=784.926s">So,</a>  I mean, that's just in the last few days, and we've been getting complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=788.789s">It's</a>  almost a little bit out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=792.391s">You</a>  know, they should have guidelines, they should be properly trained, and Republic needs to take responsibility for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=798.376s">Somebody</a>  shouldn't have to go with a handicapped parking spot, or somebody shouldn't have to go who was waiting in line or who actually did pay, take the time out of their busy schedules, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=808.093s">and</a>  go to the parking office to get it taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=811.154s">And</a>  the chief of police has been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=813.135s">If</a>  somebody contacts one of us or probably the mayor's office, we can get it all squared away and figured out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=818.696s">But</a>  not everybody thinks to maybe call us or call the mayor's office, and they have to go down, take the time out of their work schedule, and get it taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=829.486s">you</a>  know, the resident was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=831.366s">This</a>  was implemented at the wrong time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=833.487s">And</a>  not only that, it's just not performed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=837.347s">It's</a>  very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=838.648s">And,</a>  you know, I look forward to the meeting on the 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=840.888s">Hopefully</a>  we can get a lot accomplished and a lot resolved for our business people and our residents.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=845.549s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=848.009s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Penta, Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=851.77s">Just</a>  real quick on Councilor Lungo-Koehn's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=854.03s">I</a>  have pictures here of just this past week and as late as yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=858.744s">with</a>  these trucks driving around, driving around, unmarked, in particular locations within the city, on the ring road, and designated spots where they're not supposed to be, giving out tickets at 7.38 a.m., which is supposed to not start until 8 o'clock in the morning, and we can continue on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=879.721s">This</a>  is in complete violation of the contract on page four of the contract that they have with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=887.257s">You</a>  know, I know, Mr. President, you're having the meeting on the 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=890.559s">You</a>  know, I don't know how much can be resolved by then. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=892.96s">But</a>  it's quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=893.761s">And</a>  I'll just end it by saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=895.182s">You</a>  know, they had the contract signed on October 10th of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=899.424s">And</a>  they had the luxury from October 10th, 2014, to January 15th, when it was supposed to be implemented, and strike that first day of implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=907.009s">And</a>  on February 3rd, it was Councilor Caraviello's resolution offered before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=911.511s">Because</a>  at that point in time, from January 15th to February 2nd, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=914.898s">The</a>  screens were so light and hard to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=917.619s">The</a>  resolution was put on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=919.039s">And</a>  as we speak today on April 7th, they're still the same way, hard to read, almost illegible, especially if the sun is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=926.441s">And</a>  we can go through a whole litany of other things beside that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=929.022s">So</a>  it's just obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=930.022s">And</a>  their public relations, it just doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=932.703s">And</a>  maybe they had no human resource background on teaching the folks that are going to work here in this city how to handle the people, talk to the people, whether it's permit parking, whether it's just giving people out tickets and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=945.253s">I</a>  think this has been a complete disaster, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=948.334s">This</a>  is Mayor McGlynn's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=950.095s">He</a>  owns it lock, stock, and barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=952.156s">And</a>  if anyone has a concern, as you continue to have concerns, please call his office and tell him that you're dissatisfied and you want resolution to these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=960.098s">Because</a>  I think the council is speaking up each and every week on behalf of the taxpayers, but the mayor is the one and the only one that can resolve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=966.661s">He</a>  signed the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=968.041s">This</a>  is his ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=969.442s">Thank</a>  you, councilor.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=971.262s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Prenta, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=973.954s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Marks, sir, you wish to address us? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=976.475s">State</a>  your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=978.295s">My</a>  name is Michael Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=979.356s">I</a>  live on 18 Pembroke Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=982.136s">Before</a>  I understand that there's going to be a committee of the whole being held on the 22nd, I wish to request two pieces, articles of information from Republic Parking so we can review from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=993.38s">The</a>  first is on their contract attachment on page 11, the operator's personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1001.318s">The</a>  operator acknowledges its responsibility to submit a recruitment plan that includes a description of its strategy to hire local residents, which shall include recruitment fairs, local print, radio, and Internet advertisements. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1014.124s">I'm</a>  not aware of any plan that has been posted, so one could be reviewed by the public before the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1021.428s">That</a>  would be of great help to me, so we can prepare. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1024.629s">The</a>  second thing I wish to ask for, if we could actually see the daily sales receipts that Republic Parking has posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1032.332s">I</a>  have not been able to access any of those online daily receipts that they've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1039.194s">And</a>  I'm most interested in the money that they've received after 6 o'clock, because I know that the meters are still running. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1046.428s">So</a>  I think it's important for the city to know the money that they have acquired that is illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1052.753s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1053.653s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1054.854s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1055.835s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1057.316s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1058.837s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1059.317s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please mark Councilor Camuso as present. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1063.46s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1066.943s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1068.063s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1069.324s">Accommodations</a>  15-302. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1072.447s">Welcome</a>  to City Hall, to Medford City Council Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1076.122s">the</a>  Greater Boston League Champion Medford High School Gymnastics Team, and the Greater Boston League Champion Medford High Girls Basketball Team. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1085.871s">Councilor</a>  Knight, you had these resolutions before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1088.774s">If</a>  you'd like to come up and assume command. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1091.376s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1092.697s">And</a>  welcome up the recipients of these good awards.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1839.308s">Mr.</a>  President, members of the council, Madam President, members of the council, thank you for having me come in tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1845.911s">I</a>  understand that there's an opportunity for me to talk about what we've been doing at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital campus on noise control. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1855.135s">And</a>  we have been working on an issue that came up even two years ago when one of the neighbors did call and I was lucky to get the call and have a chance to visit with a neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1867.689s">and</a>  work on getting an engineering firm to come in and look at noise that was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1874.334s">We</a>  found from a whistle over the operating room at Lawrence that was making a shrill sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1880.038s">We</a>  replaced a bearing on that whistle. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1882.5s">We</a>  put some what we call attenuators across the air ducts along Lawrence Road that greatly reduced the sound of air vents when the air is coming in and the fans are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1897.694s">And</a>  we actually had over the course of the last year and a half a few visits from the State Department of Environmental Protection and from the Medford Department of Public Health to take a look at what the noise situation was at Lawrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1912.697s">And</a>  we have not been able to identify any noise that has not been limited so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1919.479s">And</a>  I know that there's at least one neighbor that has not been <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1924.205s">satisfied</a>  with the work that has been done, and I feel badly about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1927.766s">And</a>  we have said that we will continue to monitor, and any sounds that can be identified that we can address, we are going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1934.569s">We</a>  just haven't been able to identify ourselves any sounds that are going on that we can limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1942.092s">We</a>  actually take decibel readings two and three times a day on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1946.613s">And</a>  we have, in discussion with the inspectors for both the <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1951.778s">and</a>  for the city looked at possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1955.28s">And</a>  we've had everything from that could be sound coming off the barriers on route 93 and from traffic to it could be some kind of air transfer that's going on, but not identifiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1969.506s">So</a>  we keep, we keep working on it, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1975.849s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1977.869s">Also,</a>  if you could, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1979.478s">I</a>  know the council is going to want, if you could, in a nutshell, bring us up to date on the transfer merger ownership issues regarding the hospital as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1991.807s">Councilor</a>  Penta?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1997.252s">Alan,</a>  you indicated that you've done a host of issues as it relates to hopefully remediating the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2009.032s">at</a>  that particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2011.514s">My</a>  question to you is this, as I'm talking, I'm looking for your email. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2016.557s">I</a>  believe that you sent to one of the residents as it relates to noise being loud enough or disturbing enough that you folks would be offering space in your hospital for her to run her business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2034.878s">What's</a>  the difference between that time till now if the noise issue is still the same?</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2042.18s">Well,</a>  we would be very pleased to address the noise issue to limit the noise if we could identify together what the noise is that we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2051.761s">We</a>  haven't, we've looked at even, I've been looking at a letter that I took out today from <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2060.138s">Last</a>  year when we wrote to the State Department of Public Health during our public hearing process that I could leave if it's good enough to leave with a council to give you an idea of some of the things that <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2072.172s">We've</a>  talked with the State Department of Public Health about, could I do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2076.114s">Okay,</a>  that would be, it is informative as to some of the work that we did do as far as the engineering firm that we did hire. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2085.86s">We</a>  actually hired a couple of different engineering firms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2089.362s">One</a>  that helped us with the, what they call attenuators on the louvers, the air vents on Lawrence Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2096.966s">And</a>  another one who looked at what we might do to the air conditioning <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2101.027s">units.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2101.927s">We</a>  understand that the noise that causes problems is in the winter as well as the summer, so we don't think it's got to do with air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2111.651s">And</a>  we are concerned that it might have to do with traffic as much as anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2116.453s">But</a>  we haven't been able to identify something that we could address. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2121.675s">I'm</a>  looking at a note that came from the State Department of Public Health last year when they were looking at the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2131.031s">to</a>  say that actually it was a note to Mrs. Casey on Terrace Road who said that this gentleman with the State Department of Public Health had talked with the Medford Board of Health regarding the noise issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2144.994s">And</a>  he said that they suspect the noise may be coming from the sound barriers along the highway rather than the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2151.736s">And</a>  he says the next step is to have a gentleman from the Department of Environmental Protection conduct a tone test to get an accurate reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2159.438s">That</a>  was last summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2160.878s">And</a>  that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2163.42s">And</a>  we had some unannounced visits from both the State and the City Department of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2169.884s">And</a>  they took decibel readings and began tracking the readings and did not find any noise issues to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2178.289s">So</a>  that was the difficulty we had with the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2182.212s">This</a>  is from the Medford City noise measurement report, which says no significant findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2188.836s">This</a>  is August of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2191.425s">Multiple</a>  visits to the area trying to capture when noise was described to be louder continued to yield no findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2198.009s">It</a>  is not clear what is causing the noise, even though it may be a continuous noise irritating to the occupant of a home on Terrace Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2207.435s">And</a>  we keep looking for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2209.056s">I</a>  mean, we'd love to address it, frankly.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2210.897s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2212.298s">Mr.</a>  President, through you to the chair, I have a letter here dated September 6, 2013, for which you addressed to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2221.682s">And</a>  in that letter, you addressed two particular issues, one regarding the positive effects if, in fact, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital does go in effect into a merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2229.706s">And</a>  then you have an unending paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2231.467s">It</a>  says, on a second matter, which is about the noise emitted into the neighborhood from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we have contracted with a firm to install covers over the air intakes at LMH. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2242.212s">The</a>  installation is scheduled for next Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2244.213s">It</a>  should reduce the sound a great deal, and we hope it will provide relief to the neighbors needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2251.067s">So</a>  there is an acknowledgment dating back to 2013 that the hospital acknowledges that there's an issue of noise in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2259.433s">Now,</a>  if the state is coming in or the city is coming in, and maybe they're not there on a 24-hour basis, they may be just coming in there and putting up one of those ear monitor machines and seeing if they hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2272.681s">I</a>  personally was in the hospital in a doctor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2276.235s">that</a>  faces the Lawrence Road side. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2279.998s">And</a>  I could hear it in the doctor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2282.22s">Was</a>  it consistent? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2283.3s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2283.841s">But</a>  it did run in intermittent periods of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2286.763s">Now,</a>  I believe it was some two to three weeks ago, the resident, Mrs. Casey, appeared before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2292.327s">And</a>  I believe, and I could be wrong because I know she's sitting there, she had what she had, what I believe, which is an independent contractor who would be willing to come in and service, I believe it was a $400 or $500 fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2306.352s">I</a>  could be reading this wrong, but my impression was that I believe that she would accept and hopefully the hospital would accept whatever the findings might be that would make resolution to the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2316.938s">And</a>  Mrs. Casey is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2319.619s">She</a>  can speak for herself, but I think that's the way I understood it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2323.902s">And</a>  that should not be at her cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2326.603s">It</a>  should be at the hospital's cost because the track record exists that you folks at the hospital before you became CEO, and I wish you good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2334.301s">Um,</a>  but more importantly, you know, the neighborhood right now is an issue and it's, it'll always be an issue as long as that hospital is there.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2341.826s">Uh,</a>  first of all, I want to say thank you very much for, for your good wishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2346.009s">And,</a>  uh, I also want to say, I really, uh, respect what the council does in this case, in all cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2354.355s">And</a>  I feel that I'm working for the Medford city council and all the residents of Medford in the job that I have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2360.319s">I</a>  think there's a tremendous public asset that this hospital is, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2364.404s">And</a>  I want it to be as strong and good for the community as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2368.365s">And</a>  I feel that I'm representing the same folks that you represent, and that I'm working for you and for the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2374.386s">And</a>  I want to do a good job with that hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2376.667s">Very,</a>  very much so.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2377.947s">The</a>  only difference is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2379.687s">You</a>  make a lot more money than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2381.528s">That's</a>  the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2383.248s">So</a>  you have to do a good job to stay in your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2386.669s">The</a>  people can throw us out at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2389.029s">But</a>  you're stuck there with a good salary.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2393.262s">I</a>  want to do the job, whether I get paid or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2395.743s">I</a>  was 20 years a volunteer for LMH and Hallmark Health before I worked for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2401.385s">I've</a>  been 26 years active with the hospital, only the last three working for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2406.986s">23</a>  years as a volunteer because I love the place so much, and I want to do a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2411.267s">Whether</a>  they pay me or they don't pay me, I want to do a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2413.828s">Let</a>  me just say, if I could, Mr. President, I did not know that she had come in and talked about the $400, $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2420.877s">We</a>  spent $25,000 on those covers for the air vents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2424.84s">So</a>  it's not a problem of the $400. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2427.622s">We</a>  actually have spent altogether some $50,000 plus in responding to the comments that we've heard from Mrs. Casey, trying very hard to please her and do the things that she wants to have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2439.19s">So</a>  it's not $400. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2439.73s">We're</a>  over $50,000 already. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2440.851s">But</a>  I understand that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2444.607s">Your</a>  own e-mails acknowledge the fact that a noise problem did exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2448.249s">And</a>  however they've been resolved, mitigated or whatever they might be, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2452.292s">But</a>  can we have Mrs. Casey just answer that question? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2455.294s">I</a>  think this will resolve the whole problem.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2457.495s">Could</a>  I say before that?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2458.576s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2458.976s">That</a>  letter of September 13, that was prior to putting on the covers over the events. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2465.14s">So</a>  we put the covers over the events in September of 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2468.882s">And</a>  the measurements I talked about here were August of 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2472.86s">These</a>  are reports that came in from the State Department of Environmental Protection and the Medford Department of Health in August of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2479.967s">The</a>  Ubers were covered in September of 13, that's when I wrote to you, September 13, that we were studying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2487.334s">And</a>  we took the recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2489.096s">We</a>  spent $25,000, it had nothing to do with the money, but we decided that we wanted to do it as we could, and that was, so we acted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2498.178s">I</a>  just don't want you to think we didn't do anything.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2500.599s">Nobody's</a>  saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2501.26s">I</a>  just, just want this problem resolved and to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2505.782s">So</a>  could we just, can we have Mrs. Casey just answer that question?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2509.103s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2509.844s">Mrs.</a>  Casey, if you would, please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2514.126s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2514.366s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2514.606s">My</a>  name is Michelle Casey and I live at 98 Terrace Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2517.728s">Thanks</a>  again for having me back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2519.649s">Yes,</a>  I have done some research and I have contacted two independent acoustical engineering firms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2527.26s">And</a>  what has been told to me is that if they do come into my home, they can run testing to determine, in fact, what the noise is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2535.687s">And</a>  that's what I am requesting, that that work takes place and that we can get a resolution to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2541.331s">And,</a>  you know, I will acknowledge, you know, Mr. McDonald and I have had communication back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2547.135s">But</a>  at this point, you know, I need to have my home so that my family and I can live in my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2554.261s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2559.06s">Mr.</a>  McDonald, you can continue if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2560.981s">I'm</a>  just only wondering, and I'm not opposed to doing more testing at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2565.564s">And</a>  I will talk with Mrs. Casey about it, but I don't understand how the testing inside the house is going to identify the noise outside at Lawrence Memorial's campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2577.09s">I</a>  mean, maybe it would, but I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2579.872s">I'm</a>  not an engineer, but I'm wondering how the testing that we've done all over the campus on the roofs of the hospital <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2588.644s">in</a>  by the Air National?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2592.486s">Actually,</a>  the report that I sent you does state the work that they would do in an acoustical engineering firm when they come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2599.67s">And</a>  they're able to measure the noise from inside a contained facility, which would be my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2605.353s">So</a>  they are, in fact, there's many engineers out there, acoustical engineers out there, that will do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2610.656s">And</a>  I did find someone local in Cambridge that can, in fact, do that and determine what the noise is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2617.471s">and</a>  hopefully come up with a solution to mitigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2620.332s">Because</a>  we just can't live in our home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2622.293s">And</a>  that's the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2624.373s">The</a>  noise is just there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2626.094s">We</a>  cannot escape it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2627.414s">You</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2628.014s">I've</a>  told you that many, many times to your face. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2630.935s">But</a>  I need to be able to live in my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2633.036s">I</a>  pay taxes in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2634.797s">And</a>  I want to have some peace in my home.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2639.735s">I</a>  would love to solve it, really would. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2642.036s">I</a>  mean, and I understand that, I know Mrs. Casey's been there a long time, that there was not the noise for a long time, and that it's the last four years or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2651.7s">But</a>  we don't know, we've not done anything different in the last four years, but we don't know why there would be a noise the last four years, but not before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2659.724s">We</a>  just can't figure it out.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2660.884s">Yeah,</a>  and I did send to the former president the two independent acoustical engineering firms, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2667.769s">And</a>  I did ask for him to look into it and to contract with these folks to get a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2674.932s">So</a>  hopefully now, with you being the president, that you'll be able to help me with this issue.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2679.513s">Well,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2680.314s">And</a>  I was not aware of that request that they have him take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2684.555s">This</a>  is the first I heard of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2688.597s">Maybe</a>  we can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2689.757s">Maybe</a>  we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2693.158s">I</a>  guess blind, you know, I don't want to say that I endorse the acoustical engineer without knowing who the firm is, but... I actually copied you on that email.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2703.983s">You</a>  should have that in your email that I sent a couple months ago.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2707.305s">Well,</a>  we'll talk about that and maybe that's something we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2710.867s">Certainly,</a>  the expense is not the problem.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2713.408s">Well,</a>  I don't think it's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2714.288s">I</a>  think it's just getting to a final resolution and maybe this outside independent of both of you can bring <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2720.088s">resolution</a>  to the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2721.289s">And</a>  I think she would be willing to accept it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2723.51s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2724.731s">Thank</a>  you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2725.511s">Uh,</a>  Councilor curve yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2727.552s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2728.233s">Again,</a>  I want to thank Mr. McDonald for coming down here and, and Mrs. Casey, and hopefully the two years can work something. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2733.936s">I</a>  think the $400 is a small price to pay for everyone's peace of mind.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2740.019s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2745.662s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2746.983s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2747.323s">And</a>  Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2748.955s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2749.996s">And</a>  I said what I had to say regarding the noise a few weeks ago, that I was sure the Lawrence Memorial Hospital would do whatever they could under his leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2758.122s">But</a>  this evening, I would like to publicly thank, number one, and congratulate Mr. McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2765.348s">You</a>  know, there's no one better, no one better, in my eyes, to run our local hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2771.713s">Someone</a>  that's volunteered there, has been a member of the board for 20-plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2777.455s">And</a>  he's committed to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2780.397s">And</a>  when we're on the bigger horizon of possibly merging with an international institute that's known for medicine throughout the world, I don't think there's anyone better that could be in charge than Mr. McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2796.708s">So</a>  as a city, we're very lucky that we have this young gentleman here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2801.571s">So</a>  I want to wish you well in your new position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2804.633s">And</a>  very, very, very responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2807.967s">I've</a>  had a column three times in the last few months and gets back to the same day and meets the needs of this community every time that something within reasonableness is requested of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2819.269s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2820.21s">Thank</a>  you so much for those comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2822.33s">I</a>  appreciate it very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2825.971s">I'll</a>  tell you what my loyalty and my heart is right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2829.372s">My</a>  dad ran in 1936 for the city council and didn't make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2833.492s">He</a>  lost by 16 votes of getting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2835.513s">But,</a>  uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2836.488s">He</a>  stayed active in Medford over his lifetime. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2838.688s">And,</a>  and when I got involved in the late eighties at the Lawrence, it was in his name and I'm still doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2844.069s">And</a>  I come here and I think of him, how much he would love to be sitting with you gentlemen and madam, madam president yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2851.251s">He</a>  would love to be sitting right here with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2853.011s">No</a>  question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2854.791s">Anyway,</a>  you wanted to ask me, Mr. President, a little bit about the potential affiliation.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2859.752s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2860.952s">Uh,</a>  we have a council max, uh, next.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2865.494s">I'll</a>  be brief, Mr. President, but I think the last piece of the puzzle would be this acoustical engineering study. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2872.417s">It'll</a>  take a snapshot of what's happening in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2875.399s">If</a>  we can pinpoint, it might be something internal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2877.56s">Who</a>  knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2878.46s">Maybe</a>  it's something within your own home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2880.181s">We</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2880.801s">But</a>  we'll find out from this study. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2883.083s">I</a>  think it'll be worth its weight in gold, President, to have it done and move forward on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2888.845s">I</a>  know you have a lot on your plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2890.706s">And</a>  although you want to address these issues, I'm sure you want to get this behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2895.042s">I</a>  look forward to seeing this done within the next several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2898.223s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2898.843s">Councilor,</a>  Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2900.584s">Thank</a>  you, President DeLaRusso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2901.585s">I</a>  also want to thank Mr. McDonald for agreeing to do the study at the home, and I, too, hope it's done within the next few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2908.347s">And</a>  if we could, through the chair, if we could get a report on that study, if possible, that would be greatly appreciated so we know the outcome.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2917.27s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2917.77s">So</a>  Mr. McDonald will share the outcome of that report with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2922.932s">That</a>  would be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2925.038s">And</a>  if you could, now, at this time, just in Noochay, bring the council up to date on the merger process.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2931.7s">Mr.</a>  Sperling. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2932.26s">Very</a>  briefly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2934.14s">We</a>  still continue to have discussions with the Partners Healthcare. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2938.562s">We</a>  determined that the number one future for the Hallmark Health Complex, which is Lawrence Memorial Hospital of Medford and Melrose-Wakefield Hospital, Clinic and Reading Cancer Care at Stoneham, is to be working with <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2955.258s">The</a>  Mass General Hospital and Partners Network, they dearly love, as you heard Dr. Torciana here in the fall of 2013, they dearly love the opportunity to invest some of their resources in these communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2970.11s">Medford</a>  particularly and Melrose-Wakefield where the larger installations are for Hallmark Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2977.315s">As</a>  you know, we had a consent agreement from Attorney General Martha Coakley which would have allowed that to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2984.753s">And</a>  that was dismissed by the court with new Attorney General Maura Healey at the start of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=2991.077s">We</a>  continue to meet with the Attorney General and with partners to look for an opportunity to show the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, working hard with the Commonwealth, that putting together Hallmark Health and Partners Healthcare would be a tremendous asset for the communities that we serve for future generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3010.549s">We</a>  believe it's the number one opportunity for us <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3013.305s">knowing</a>  we have to, as a community hospital system, grow into a network that can take patients pre-admission through post-discharge with tertiary academic medical center coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3024.987s">That's</a>  what accountable care organizations are driving all of us with community hospitals toward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3030.948s">And</a>  we see other community hospitals merging with tertiary care centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3036.229s">And</a>  the same argument that they have that's so acceptable when they've done it is the argument we have for our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3043.775s">The</a>  difficulty we have, of course, is that Partners is the largest of the academic medical centers, and the concern is whether or not there could be anti-competitive practices if indeed we work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3056.54s">We</a>  feel that it's not about that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3059.641s">For</a>  us, it's really about giving an opportunity for patients in the community setting to stay in the community setting, not have to go into Boston for what they need for lower acuity care, and that is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3073.596s">partners</a>  needs because they need, as an economic imperative, to find a way for patients that come into Boston, to their institution, staying in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3082.601s">We</a>  are prepared to serve those patients. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3085.143s">And</a>  with the combination of the investments that we can make with partners and attracting the patients to stay in the community at a lower cost, at much more convenience, and we have all of the talent in doctors and nurses to take care of those patients, we feel it's the best solution <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3103.462s">for</a>  the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3104.643s">And</a>  we are still engaged in those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3107.784s">And</a>  we have not been told yet that we don't have an opportunity to put it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3114.287s">I</a>  think the concern is whether or not there would be enough watchdog and restrictions over the activities of our new medical accountable care organization that we would be part of to satisfy the Commonwealth of Mass that we are not <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3133.845s">raising</a>  prices in the healthcare system, but providing more economical and convenient opportunity for patients. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3140.446s">So</a>  we're working very hard at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3142.447s">We're</a>  in a pause in the sense that there are no dates for public hearings or court hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3149.068s">They're</a>  only conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3150.348s">So</a>  I know that there have been press stories about a pause. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3156.969s">The</a>  pause is not to concern ourselves with whether it's the right path. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3162.052s">The</a>  pause is to figure out how to make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3165.253s">And</a>  truthfully, it means so very much to our communities that I hope that it becomes more of a public discussion, frankly, about the importance of it to the community level. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3177.936s">I</a>  know a lot of the public discussion has been whether or not Partners Healthcare is too big to have this happen, and the attention's been on the bigger partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3187.235s">We're</a>  the smaller partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3188.696s">We</a>  would love a little attention on why it's so important to the community because we think that it will make a tremendous difference for the future of the residents in Medford, future of the residents in Melrose and Wakefield, Malden, Saugus, Reading, North Reading, all the places that are served. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3207.266s">But</a>  it would make a tremendous difference to be able to have the Lawrence serve a population of a bigger size, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3214.62s">And</a>  it would be a tremendous advantage to the citizens of Medford to have that medical complex right there at the Roosevelt Circle, where Daniel Lawrence had a beautiful idea of putting that hospital there, because who knew that Route 93 was going to go right by? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3229.543s">It's</a>  so accessible, so convenient for people, not just in the city of Medford, but other places, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3235.505s">And</a>  if we had the volume of people using Lawrence, which we are prepared to handle, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3241.358s">It</a>  would make a tremendous difference in building that complex for the future, which is what we'd love to do.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3245.761s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. McDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3249.224s">Thank</a>  you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3249.804s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3254.427s">Alan,</a>  one of the things that came out of the report from the new Attorney General Maury Healy was not only the concern of maybe lack of competition, but I believe that there were 50 other medical <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3270.077s">senior</a>  people, doctors in hospitals, who indicated that there was no belief that those prices were going to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3276.879s">And</a>  I think that was one of the major issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3279.66s">Another</a>  concern, if I understood it correctly, is the fact that even if this merger is or were to have taken place, the guarantee that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital would become part of the Mass General or the Partners Group did not have a beginning date. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3296.525s">They</a>  had that five-year window, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3300.48s">And</a>  I think one of the concerns, because in my letter that I addressed to both attorney generals and to the judge, is that if this were to take place, I think that the licensure should become operative immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3314.527s">So</a>  that way the city of Medford knows that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is not in a holding patent, and we're not going to be just shuffled around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3322.323s">so</a>  to speak, because I'll speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3324.924s">My</a>  opinion is the Melrose-Wakefield right now seems to have gotten the bigger bite of the apple of what could possibly be had here for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3332.708s">So</a>  I don't think the Lawrence Memorial is out of the ballgame at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3336.21s">I</a>  think it's still in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3337.67s">But</a>  I would strongly, and I would write it again, and I would repeat my letter to whoever the attorney or the judge might be, that the Medford licensure for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital has to become an immediate decision <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3352.127s">Uh,</a>  not a decision breaker, an immediate decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3354.929s">So</a>  the patients, the administration, the doctors, everybody knows that this hospital is alive and well, and it's not on a holding patent because that was the one thing that you did not read in the decision that was, that was rented by Martha Coakley. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3370.118s">That</a>  licensure was not in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3372.319s">And</a>  I know Maura Healy has a different, a different position on that.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3375.381s">So,</a>  well, I would say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3377.502s">And</a>  I certainly wouldn't object to that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3379.643s">I,</a>  I know that, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3382.165s">When</a>  Partners Healthcare, I shouldn't speak for them, can't speak for them, but I know that they are very desirous of having an active campus at Alarmist Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3394.334s">And</a>  it's a very attractive site for them, given where Mass General Hospital is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3399.737s">And</a>  we're right up the street as far as their concern and I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3403.2s">And</a>  it'd be a tremendous opportunity for them to be helping us with primary and secondary care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3411.227s">in</a>  a very accessible location, easily accessible to Mass General Hospital for a tertiary care for those patients that would need it from warrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3419.65s">And</a>  that would be a tremendous advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3421.23s">So</a>  they see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3423.251s">I</a>  think the discussion on the immediate license situation was over a three to five year program of putting everything together, because it doesn't happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3433.075s">But</a>  that was part of the definitive agreement that they would indeed have the license and have that be part of <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3441.08s">of</a>  Mass General Hospital's administration, with the Hallmark Health Administration being part of the management team that would take care of that hospital and keep it going.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3453.884s">My</a>  apologies, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3455.165s">Judge</a>  Saunders, in her written opinion, was very specific as it related to the cost containment not being able to be proven by partners, and also, I believe, the competition that the cost containment <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3470.786s">could</a>  not prove that it would be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3473.188s">I</a>  think in the decision that was rendered by the Attorney General, the first one, Coakley, I believe there was a five or a six year gap in there or a window that they said that they wouldn't raise rates.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3485.376s">There</a>  were, yes, there was a five, actually five and eight and ten, there were different kinds of windows, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3490.88s">And</a>  I think when Maura Healey, the new Attorney General, was looking for something that would be more of an establishment, that it would be well recognized and it could be amortized out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3499.146s">And</a>  I think that was one of the things that was <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3502.103s">That</a>  was deficient in the report that Martha Coakley, the original Attorney General, who rendered her opinion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3510.666s">But</a>  the licensure issue is the key.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3512.747s">I</a>  appreciate what you're saying, because I think I'm understanding that that could be a big advantage to us if we could get that straightened out.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3519.689s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3520.809s">And</a>  I think whatever your negotiations might be right now with partners, I think that should probably be premier right on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3527.432s">We'd</a>  like to be a party of this, but we have to have an understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3532.088s">that</a>  we have doctors that are well-respected in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3534.99s">You</a>  know, we don't want them to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3536.191s">We</a>  certainly don't want the citizens of Medford to leave the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3540.013s">And</a>  for whatever and however, it's going to be left as an established hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3543.535s">But</a>  if we don't have our license or our licensure, however you want to term it, in hand, then we have to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3549.999s">That's</a>  just going to prompt these people to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3551.781s">It's</a>  going to prompt your nurses to say, hey, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3554.582s">Where</a>  am I going to go?</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3555.063s">I</a>  appreciate what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3555.783s">We</a>  would still have the license under that prior <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3559.055s">agreement,</a>  it wouldn't be that we would be unlicensed, it would still be very, very active. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3564.117s">But</a>  I hear what you say, and it's an interesting point.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3567.718s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3568.438s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3569.258s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3570.679s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3572.559s">I</a>  was just going to speak after this paper, if we could take a few other items on the suspension.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3576.78s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3578.421s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3583.442s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3585.877s">Motion</a>  passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3586.878s">Thank</a>  you very, very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3589.939s">Thank</a>  you for your leadership, and thank you for moving towards resolution this neighborhood issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3595.903s">Did</a>  Mr. Capucci need to speak on this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3598.465s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3600.726s">If</a>  you would, just state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3603.247s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3604.488s">I'm</a>  Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3607.27s">While</a>  I have this opportunity with President McDonald here, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3611.45s">Through</a>  the chair, I just have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3615.733s">I</a>  definitely don't want Medford to lose anything in a possible merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3622.517s">I</a>  strongly agree with the points Councilor Penta is bringing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3627.66s">But</a>  there's another aspect to this that deeply concerns me as I work in the medical device industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3636.325s">As</a>  I'm sure thousands of more Medford residents do, Stoneham, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3640.464s">and</a>  this greater community does. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3643.307s">So</a>  with all due respect, through the chair, if I could ask President McDonald to perhaps speak on his, what's the word, on his professional opinion about these conversations he's having as to, he said there's no timeline or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3664.809s">that</a>  could be projected, but based on the conversations that he's having. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3669.733s">Because</a>  a lot of jobs are in the balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3673.577s">From</a>  my industry, personally, I make laser scalpels, and our sales went through the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3680.703s">Lots</a>  of people got laid off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3682.344s">It's</a>  not just my company. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3684.206s">Hologic</a>  up in Bedford, their market share went down 40% with the larger <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3692.385s">doom</a>  hanging over us, for lack of a better term, of the Affordable Care Act, which caused a lot of insurance rates to go up, a lot of hospitals to make these mergers that are going on, not just in our community, but around the country, that are affecting a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3710.115s">And</a>  I'm sorry, Mr. President, but this is a very huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3716.419s">I'll</a>  try to be expedient, but please don't rush me out the podium, with all due respect.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3721.967s">Point</a>  of personal privilege, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3725.108s">Mr.</a>  McDonald came here this evening to discuss an issue on Terrance Road, and I find it unfair to have him come down here and now discuss the issue of the hospital merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3732.19s">I</a>  think that Mr. McDonald might want to have an opportunity to prepare himself to come down here and speak about this to maybe get some questions in advance to have answers to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3741.314s">So,</a>  you know, I certainly can understand the issue of uncertainty, and I think that nobody understands that better than Mr. McDonald, because he's very uncertain as to what's going to happen as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3752.014s">And</a>  to put him on the spot right here this evening and ask him, what's going on with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3755.215s">What</a>  do you think about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3756.075s">What</a>  do you think about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3756.996s">When</a>  there's no plan finalized, it really puts him in a bad position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3760.397s">He's</a>  going to say one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3761.297s">He</a>  might come back three months later, and the situation's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3763.658s">And</a>  then we're all going to say, you said this at this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3766.519s">So</a>  I think we might want to give Mr. McDonald an opportunity to prepare himself to come down and speak about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3771.601s">He's</a>  always been willing to come down to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3773.241s">He's</a>  never been afraid to stand up at that podium and take questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3775.967s">for</a>  hours at a time, Mr. President, but I just think that, you know, we have to extend to him the courtesy to be willing to have an opportunity to prepare if, in fact, he is going to speak at length on this type of thing.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3784.849s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3786.71s">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Lunkert-Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3789.271s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3790.791s">I</a>  believe Mr. McDonald is the one that began speaking about the possible merger situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3796.132s">At</a>  my behest. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3799.253s">Oh,</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3801.114s">And</a>  I believe he's <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3802.663s">you</a>  know, able to say whether or not he's able to speak on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3806.785s">So</a>  if we have questions, we have questions.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3808.766s">I</a>  mean, I understand both sides, but... Thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3811.987s">So</a>  we're going to allow Mr. Capucci to give us concise on-topic <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3816.997s">questions</a>  and then briefly allow respect.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3818.398s">With</a>  all due respect, I'm not asking any questions to put anybody on the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3822.422s">This</a>  council... We know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3823.963s">...asked</a>  about the merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3825.484s">And</a>  since it did come up, as a citizen, representing thousands of people that work in the industry who are very concerned about this merger, I think it's prudent, I think it's sufficient, and I think it's precise... It has been established, so if you could... ...to ask, through the chair, President McDonald's professional opinion on whether or not he thinks this merger is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3846.474s">and</a>  whether or not, based on the conversations he admitted having, whether or not, what kind of a timeline we're looking at.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3853.699s">Because</a>  a lot of people's livelihoods are in the balance.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3858.923s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3859.944s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Capucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3861.645s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3862.145s">Councilor</a>  Knight, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3864.027s">And</a>  that's a good point that I would love to come back another time and even have a more detailed discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3869.851s">So</a>  I appreciate that very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3871.852s">But</a>  what I can say is that it is a huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3876.078s">Uh,</a>  and, uh, we would love to do it tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3879.18s">We</a>  would just love to do it right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3880.941s">We</a>  thought we started discussions with partners, healthcare, it was the summer of 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3886.504s">So</a>  it'll be three years this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3888.625s">And</a>  I honestly thought we would get there in 13, certainly in 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3892.427s">And</a>  we did not, uh, when the attorney general Coakley filed her consent agreement, it was April of 2014, 12 months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3899.55s">And</a>  I thought we were there, but, uh, it didn't happen, but what's happening in the industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3905.053s">nationally</a>  is this consolidation, and it has got to do with the fact that there's less inpatient volume for hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3913.195s">I</a>  mean, we built hospitals up from the late 1920s up through the end of the century with a lot of subsidization and a lot of first-dollar insurance coverage, so people came to the hospitals more frequently when they needed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3927.879s">In</a>  a sense, they were more covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3930.399s">Now</a>  we have more consumer choice on deductibles and <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3933.465s">co-pays,</a>  we don't have as much immediate use of the hospital facilities all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3938.008s">And</a>  also technology has helped out so much that we don't come in for four or five days for appendicitis or hernia or those kinds of things, which once upon a time we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3948.075s">Now</a>  there's an afternoon procedure and you go home and get a call the next morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3951.857s">So</a>  it's changed dramatically what we built the hospitals for and it's become much less across the country, a hospital centric system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3960.617s">It's</a>  a community-centric system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3962.237s">It's</a>  about wellness in the community, reaching out and keeping people healthier and not having to come into the hospital as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3968.099s">It's</a>  changed the way we make our investments for the future of healthcare. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3972.54s">And</a>  it's not just about the beds in a hospital as much as this electronic health records, recruiting physicians, setting up medical office buildings, having clinical diagnostic opportunities that are not overnight stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3984.184s">And</a>  so it's changed a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3985.824s">And</a>  what we see at Lawrence in the plan that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3988.896s">put</a>  forward is still continuing to have beds, but we have 134 beds licensed at Lawrence now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3995.318s">We</a>  don't use 134 beds. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3997.038s">We</a>  haven't for a long, long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3999.138s">We'd</a>  like to put in the definitive agreement, as you know, was to put 90 to $100 million into the Lawrence, but not for 134 beds because we don't use 134 beds. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4009.161s">If</a>  we put $100 million into 134 beds and we only use 40 or 50, we wouldn't be able to pay the 100 million back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4016.422s">We'd</a>  be out of business and we would not have a Lawrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4019.068s">However,</a>  if we invest for what the patient base uses it for now, which is ambulatory, outpatient, clinical, diagnostic, short stay, we can always build up if things don't ever stay the same as we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4032.697s">If</a>  you need more beds over time, you can always build up to have it if you're there and if you're part of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4038.58s">If</a>  you're not there, then you can't just start it overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4041.742s">It's</a>  just too big of a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4043.402s">You</a>  see what's happened in other communities around us, Arlington, Woburn, Stoner, Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4048.985s">You</a>  know, we're not immune from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4050.927s">We're</a>  trying very hard to make it work, and we can see how to make it work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4054.969s">And</a>  that's the investment to reach the patient base the way the patients want to use the hospital health care system now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4061.733s">And</a>  it's different than 1970 and 80 and 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4064.815s">We</a>  see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4065.476s">We</a>  know how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4067.117s">We</a>  just need to get going with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4068.878s">And</a>  we want to do it in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4073.185s">and</a>  get it settled and move it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4075.626s">So</a>  we're working very hard on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4077.627s">And</a>  we take great pride in what we have on that hill, and we want to make it even better.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4082.79s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4083.37s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4084.77s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4085.851s">If</a>  I may, in the past, my take on this whole merger has been I'm looking at a trend in the medical field in greater Boston, which is unique in its has the best teaching hospitals around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4099.937s">But</a>  the fact of the matter is, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4101.422s">There</a>  is a major trend from the 1990s to today that hospitals... When's the last time we saw a new hospital opening? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4109.287s">1937,</a>  when Daniel Lawrence opened this up, or whatever the year was? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4112.609s">Hospitals</a>  are tending to close now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4114.951s">New</a>  England Memorial, right here in Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4117.112s">It</a>  was sitting as a vacant building up until recently, a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4120.414s">The</a>  Malden Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4121.675s">The</a>  Whitten Hospital was on its last breath, and Cambridge Health Alliance came in and bought it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4128.039s">In</a>  the Boston Globe yesterday, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4130.592s">The</a>  Spaulding Hospital for Continuing Medical Care North Shore, 275 employees, 160 beds closing this September. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4139.578s">This</a>  September. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4141.38s">Now</a>  that's going to become a vacant building up in Salem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4144.121s">The</a>  last thing I want to see as a city councilor is a vacant building in the Lawrence Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4150.052s">That's</a>  the last thing I want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4151.873s">I</a>  am convinced, based upon statistical data that we've been watching in this greater Boston area, on the South Shore, on the North Shore, and throughout the nation, that without mergers of this nature, we're not going to have a hospital in a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4166.664s">Mrs.</a>  Casey, we don't know what she may look out the window and see up in her neighborhood, quite honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4173.649s">And</a>  that within itself is scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4175.29s">It</a>  could change the whole character of an entire neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4178.729s">So</a>  as far as I'm concerned, I think that this is, I still think that this is definitely a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4185.833s">People</a>  are concerned as far as employees up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4188.074s">It's</a>  a major employer of the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4191.336s">But</a>  I'd rather see people that are employed up there have an opportunity to go work for some entity on Lawrence Road that's a healthcare facility than get a pink slip, close its doors, and now they're collecting unemployment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4205.123s">I</a>  think it's the way lesser of two evils. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4207.788s">So</a>  for all those reasons, plus I think we're in good hands with the leadership at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital right now, I think it's the premier time to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4218.914s">Because</a>  with all due respect to people out there that may be against this, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4225.112s">This</a>  might be the only thing that keeps that building alive, vibrant, and accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4230.136s">And</a>  let's not forget about another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4232.458s">Urgent</a>  cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4233.979s">1984,</a>  you didn't even hear of urgent care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4236.381s">1995,</a>  you didn't even hear of urgent care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4238.102s">Urgent</a>  care is servicing just as many patients a day, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4242.225s">Am</a>  I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4243.326s">Then</a>  the emergency rooms in this entire area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4246.448s">People</a>  don't want to have to wait three hours to get a quick two stitches on their finger because they cut a piece of meatloaf or something at their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4253.434s">They</a>  want to go into urgent care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4254.935s">They're</a>  in and out within 45 minutes an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4256.757s">That's</a>  what most of them pride themselves on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4258.858s">We</a>  have one right up here at the Lawrence Memorial site that's open up until I believe seven o'clock at night.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4263.262s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4264.463s">Winchester</a>  Hospital is opening them up everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4266.544s">You</a>  can go to Wilmington and get into Winchester Urgent Care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4268.766s">You</a>  can go <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4270.658s">You</a>  can go, I believe it's Redding, there's another urgent care.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4272.919s">We</a>  have an urgent care in Redding as well as at LMH.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4275.76s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4276.32s">So</a>  the trends are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4278.44s">And</a>  for us to sit here and not obviously look at the statistical data, I'm not saying that we're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4282.642s">But</a>  I think this is very unique because I think based upon the conversations that have been behind this rail over the past few years regarding this merger, as you said, since 2012, I think we're all cognizant of that fact for the Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4296.746s">Because</a>  I've already heard from people over on Sampson Road and on the backside of the hospital <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4300.797s">where</a>  the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and the nursing home agreed to grow bushes recently and bring in bushes to protect some of the integrity of the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4308.664s">I</a>  know the original agreement.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4313.768s">I</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4314.609s">On</a>  that issue with the bushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4315.87s">There</a>  was an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4317.211s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4317.871s">The</a>  unfortunate part about that, the folks at the nursing home cut the bushes down by mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4322.535s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4323.736s">Or</a>  whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4324.777s">And</a>  it was at the behest of the residents that forced the issue for which <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4329.788s">the</a>  hospital, the nursing home, had to put the bushes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4332.509s">So</a>  no fault of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4334.069s">I</a>  didn't say that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4335.049s">I'm</a>  not sure why you would insinuate that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4337.63s">Well,</a>  you indicated through a mutual agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4339.73s">There</a>  was no mutual agreement.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4340.37s">It</a>  was a mutual agreement originally in the original plans with the city of Medford back when that nursing home was built, when you were on the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4347.092s">I</a>  understand that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4348.192s">But</a>  you just said now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4349.313s">We</a>  made our point of clarification.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4350.553s">Council,</a>  we're on the same page here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4352.033s">We're</a>  on the same page here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4353.894s">So</a>  like I said, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4355.634s">I</a>  think we have to continue to endorse this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4357.755s">I</a>  think the city council should go on record <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4359.956s">sending</a>  another letter to the new attorney general that the city council supports this merger with partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4366.879s">And,</a>  uh, at some point, if the attorney general will not allow that to go through, I would personally recommend the board and, um, in the powers to be to start pursuing other relationships with other hospitals that may be smaller, that the attorney general will allow to pass, because that's the only future I think we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4386.325s">having</a>  a medical facility in the Lawrence Road area, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4390.506s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4392.166s">Point</a>  of information, Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4393.427s">I</a>  believe it was this council that made a request that have either Maura Healy or someone from her office attend a city council meeting to explain that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4401.509s">And</a>  I believe also a request to have someone from the hospital to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4405.33s">I</a>  don't want to be that presumptuous to say to go ahead and support it because the new plan may not be advantageous to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4411.871s">Well,</a>  if you notice in the, if you notice in the, in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4416.255s">The</a>  paperwork that was filed by the judge, they didn't even talk about the North Shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4422.197s">It</a>  was all about the South Shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4425.098s">And</a>  I would say, given the relationship of the North Shore area with the folks in Boston, I would say they'd be more palatable to seeing this side of the merger go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4445.978s">As</a>  a community, I think we owe it to the workers, and as you stated, the nurses and everyone else up there, to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4451.32s">If</a>  we really believe, like I do, and I'm not saying we all do, but if we really believe the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to be closed within a few years if a merger doesn't take place, then I think it's our job and duty to ask them to continue the negotiations and the discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4465.645s">And</a>  that's it.</p>

    <p>[Yqa0Po2dZcA_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4468.286s">Thank</a>  you, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4469.766s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Motel. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4470.767s">I</a>  could just with two points, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4473.328s">And</a>  the first one would be to thank this council so much for that vote at the end of 2013, which was seven to zero to support the work we're doing to strengthen Lawrence Memorial Hospital and a in a network with partners health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4489.339s">There's</a>  no question from our observation that the future for any community hospital is to be strong in a larger network. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4497.164s">And</a>  we're no different in Medford about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4500.045s">And</a>  we have a tremendous opportunity with the talent we have at Lawrence over time, still there now in the location that it is, the support of this great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4510.949s">Uh,</a>  it's, it's really, uh, it's going to make a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4513.41s">But</a>  the vote here at the end of 13 was a big factor in pushing us forward as much as we got, because it is about the community desiring to have a community hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4524.275s">And</a>  I have to say April 1st, 1924, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4527.64s">is</a>  when we opened up 90th birthday, we had it last April, we had a little birthday party in the lobby, 90 years old.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4533.466s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. I would like to make a motion to send that same exact letter that we sent out to the authorities at the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4541.553s">I</a>  believe it was to the attorney general as well as the other agencies that were involved in the merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4546.118s">The</a>  same letter to the new attorney general where the leadership has changed in the AG's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4551.223s">And</a>  I'd like to have a roll call vote on that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4552.885s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Camuso to send a letter to the AG in support of resolution of this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4558.287s">Uh,</a>  it's the same letter we sent that we support the merger.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4706.88s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4708.021s">Last</a>  week, we had a meeting in regard to Wendy's, and they had requested some changes be made to some of the things that we agreed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4717.464s">And</a>  if I can read them to you, I think last week when we voted on this, the gentleman who came up <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4725.493s">had</a>  given us information that they were going to be closing at 8, and now we finally close at 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4729.315s">And</a>  there were some changes, but if I could read you what the changes, the modifications have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4736.06s">Patio</a>  hours of operation extended to 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4739.802s">to</a>  coincide with the hours of operation of the inside dining room. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4744.825s">The</a>  patio area shall be fenced and equipped with gates that will be locked when it is not in open use. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4751.89s">In</a>  general, specifically after 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4754.031s">in</a>  lieu of installing the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4756.006s">Umbrellas</a>  for tables will be taken in each night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4759.288s">Patio</a>  area will be lighted to meet or exceed the minimum state standards for access and egress with outside lighting where public is invited or accommodated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4769.054s">Outdoor</a>  seating license will be reviewed in six months from the initial date of opening of the outdoor seating area to the public to ensure that there are no issues with the operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4780.36s">We</a>  did meet on this and I think we're all in agreement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4783.873s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4786.357s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4793.186s">I'm</a>  waiting for promptings.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4816.902s">These</a>  are what we agreed to last week at the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4822.144s">The</a>  chair recognizes Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4825.105s">Number</a>  2B, the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4827.126s">Can</a>  you explain where is this lighting going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4830.708s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record, sir.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4833.089s">My</a>  name is Chad Adams. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4834.629s">I'm</a>  with Wendy's company. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4837.851s">My</a>  address is 240 General Warren Boulevard, Melbourne, Pennsylvania. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4844.573s">The</a>  lighting will be coming from <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4846.416s">predominantly</a>  the existing light fixtures that are on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4851.019s">Uh,</a>  we discussed, uh, briefly what the foot candles are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4853.961s">It's</a>  a, it's an average foot 4.0 foot candles across the entire patio surface, which is well in excess of what the minimum standards are for outdoor seating and access ways, um, per state codes and requirements.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4867.19s">Just</a>  on that issue right there, you're going to have that shooting off the building or are these going to be individual stanchions shooting down?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4873.414s">We</a>  have, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4874.769s">Building</a>  lightings, recessed soft lightings that shine down and are completely shielded from view, illuminate the immediate area below the building surface and the existing parking lot lights that are out there right now, existing, that shine that level of light across where the patio area is going to be.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4898.842s">So</a>  through the chair, if you're saying that you're going to shut the lights off at X amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4902.504s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4903.164s">We</a>  didn't say we're going to shut the lights off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4905.951s">Well,</a>  I thought the whole idea was to give you the... Go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4911.732s">What</a>  the gentleman said, even though the dining room closes at 10, they don't shut the lights in the dining room. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4917.053s">All</a>  the lights in the whole building will remain on.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4919.394s">That's</a>  inside the building, I'm talking about outside.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4920.934s">And</a>  outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4921.934s">No</a>  lights shut down.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4922.955s">So</a>  then how does that complete the purpose, as Councilor Marks alluded to in the beginning, of people just coming in there and wanting to hang around, because they're going to see the lights on outside.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4932.817s">There's</a>  going to be a gate, a locked gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4935.614s">We</a>  have a locked gate now, which we didn't have before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4939.498s">They</a>  agreed to put a gate in there with a lock that will be locked when the dining room closes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4945.545s">I</a>  think we were all in agreement of that last week also.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4950.27s">For</a>  further clarification, Councilor Knight, I also believe that the gentleman <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4955.817s">represented</a>  the fact that they do have closed circuit surveillance cameras out there so that employees would not have to go outside if, in fact, someone was breaking the rules, jumped over the fence, that they wouldn't put themselves in danger, that they'd have an opportunity to call the law enforcement without actually having to go out there and confront individuals that may or may not be obeying the no trespassing signs or the no trespassing policy that they have in place after hours.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4976.753s">I</a>  happen to remember the police chief being present at that meeting last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4980.996s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4981.436s">Councilor</a>  Penta, are you all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4984.939s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4987.862s">Vice</a>  President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4989.103s">Thank</a>  you, President Deller. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4990.084s">So</a>  with regards to the lighting then for an extra two hours, I know that there was issue with the units that are going to be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4998.11s">Is</a>  there going to be some sort of way to direct the light so it's not in residential homes or apartments, condos, whatever is going to be built there?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5008.398s">The</a>  lighting right now, based on the existing <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5012.973s">photometric</a>  plans, I believe is at half a foot candle at the property lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5019.717s">My</a>  engineer, Mr. Donato, could speak to that more directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5024.18s">But</a>  the majority of the light is all contained within the boundaries of the property, as I believe is per code and ordinance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5035.127s">Anthony</a>  Donato with Bowler Engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5036.407s">I</a>  just wanted, Councilor Knight had asked for a copy of the lighting plan, which I had submitted last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5043.023s">You</a>  know, it does show that there's no limited spillage at the property lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5046.704s">And</a>  the patio lights in the front, the development's in the back, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5050.605s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5051.465s">Well,</a>  there's no development there yet.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5053.485s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5053.726s">Not</a>  yet.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5054.906s">I</a>  didn't know how the lights were shining in which direction from the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5058.487s">So</a>  that's all I'm asking to make sure, you know, when the units are built, that the light is directed so it's, you know, obviously not in somebody's home till 10 o'clock at night, now that we're talking the extra two hours, especially.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5070.65s">Well,</a>  just to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5073.219s">there</a>  are no additional lighting being placed on the site specifically for the patio. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5079.982s">We</a>  have building lighting that that's, that's basically the lighting we have now on the building is sort of a wash that goes over the, the mansard, if you will, and spills down the lighting that we're going to replace that with is a recessed soffit light that's tucked up in the, in the soffit and shines directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5101.67s">down</a>  onto the walkways. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5103.85s">The</a>  remainder of the lighting is gonna come from existing site lights that are already been present, have been present for the past 10, 12 years, however long the restaurant's been open.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5113.412s">Okay,</a>  that answers my question, thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5116.253s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5118.533s">The</a>  chair, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5121.153s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm amendable to this compromise and I just wanna make sure that the six month review is still in place.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5129.697s">That</a>  is on the agreement.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5130.938s">I</a>  just want to make sure that it's still part of the paper.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5133.479s">So</a>  that, that, that is clear that that was part of the agreement that came out of subcommittee, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5139.323s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5140.124s">So</a>  the chair recommends approval chair has on the motion of with the six, with the six months review that's in there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5149.29s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5150.331s">Read</a>  the six month review.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5152.052s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5152.632s">I</a>  understand what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5153.833s">So</a>  on the motion of a councilor Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5157.802s">With</a>  the six-month review all those in favor aye all those opposed I Know council night probably has one too, but one five three three six.</p>
