1
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:13,087
[SPEAKER_14]: 12th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will call, come to order.

2
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:14,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,261
Present.

12
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:30,502
Councilor Penta.

13
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:30,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Present.

14
00:00:39,074 --> 00:01:02,264
[SPEAKER_14]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

15
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:08,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I move suspension of the fools to allow a citizen to speak as it relates to her concern.

16
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:15,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

17
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:22,118
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Elsie Ashworth, and I own a hair salon at 75 Riverside Avenue, Medford Square.

18
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:24,740
[SPEAKER_20]: It's on the side of the municipal lot.

19
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:32,867
[SPEAKER_20]: After 27 years at this location, myself and my customers had never been subjected to pay to park.

20
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:36,690
[SPEAKER_20]: It is today a fact in many cities and towns.

21
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:38,572
[SPEAKER_20]: It takes adjustments.

22
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,555
[SPEAKER_20]: However, it was put in at the worst time of the year,

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,162
[SPEAKER_20]: in the middle of three terrible snowstorms.

24
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:57,369
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it was put in without thought and much consideration, with a plan which was imperfect and had so many errors.

25
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:11,458
[SPEAKER_20]: Try as you go, I call it, the merchants and business owners were burdened with additional work, teaching people how to run the kiosks, keeping change on hand, assisting the elderly,

26
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:23,174
[SPEAKER_20]: In a snowstorm, frustrated, I called the mayor's office and said to Linda, am I asked to shovel the kiosks out also?

27
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:25,275
[SPEAKER_20]: My client cannot reach it.

28
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:31,900
[SPEAKER_20]: She said, and this was terrible, have her walk to the next one.

29
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:34,722
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, she was in her 80s with a cane.

30
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:40,987
[SPEAKER_20]: If there had been better communication between pay to park and the merchants,

31
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,915
[SPEAKER_20]: we would have known they did not have to pay in a snowstorm.

32
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:54,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Now I have pictures on my iPhone showing the clients with wet hair, full of hair color, standing in the snow in 10-degree weather.

33
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,521
[SPEAKER_20]: By the way, the color on her hair was affected by the cold, and I had to redo it for free.

34
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:13,020
[SPEAKER_20]: Now I have kept many notes for months and things have changed.

35
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Winter is gone, spring in here, and the pay to park is not going to disappear.

36
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:29,193
[SPEAKER_20]: I have condensed and rewritten my notes over the months because I realize some of the fear is because there's very little information and it is so confusing.

37
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:34,597
[SPEAKER_20]: I have spoken to pay to park, the mayor's office, the chief of police.

38
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:38,000
[SPEAKER_20]: I find what is so today

39
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:39,704
[SPEAKER_20]: is changed tomorrow.

40
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:43,446
[SPEAKER_20]: Kiosks are not probed and not kept into date.

41
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:46,687
[SPEAKER_20]: They are not in tune with what we were told.

42
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:58,352
[SPEAKER_20]: I ask for pay to park and the city officials to get their act together so that we can all be informed and be on the same page.

43
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:02,313
[SPEAKER_20]: My staff and I have paid the $100 fee to be able to park.

44
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:08,025
[SPEAKER_20]: and we continue to be harassed with tickets.

45
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:18,954
[SPEAKER_20]: Myself, with a handicap ticket, I have gotten three tickets and I have to take time out of my busy life to go to the pay-to-park office and straighten it out.

46
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:23,578
[SPEAKER_20]: Questions need to be answered and made publicly known.

47
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:34,167
[SPEAKER_20]: However, in the newspaper, at the senior center, perhaps a letter to the editor of the transcript, we need to be educated and told

48
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,596
[SPEAKER_20]: what to do and what not to do.

49
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,998
[SPEAKER_20]: Questions need to be answered.

50
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:44,081
[SPEAKER_20]: Some questions about the kiosks continued to be asked of me.

51
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:47,983
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's say someone puts 50 cents in for half an hour.

52
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:49,865
[SPEAKER_20]: Can they add more money?

53
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:54,728
[SPEAKER_20]: Will the kiosk recognize the change?

54
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:56,469
[SPEAKER_20]: Question two.

55
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,772
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been told we are now to park three hours.

56
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,413
[SPEAKER_20]: It has changed from two hours to three hours.

57
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:10,937
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, when will the kiosks recognize this and can it be done in one transaction?

58
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:12,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Question three.

59
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:21,683
[SPEAKER_20]: Now from two to three hours, can we park the car and go through this without moving the car, which we have been told?

60
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:24,705
[SPEAKER_20]: It's crazy to have to come out of a business

61
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:31,244
[SPEAKER_20]: a manicurist, a hairdresser, a dentist, and have to move a car.

62
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:34,525
[SPEAKER_20]: In the municipal lot, it is not too hard.

63
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,085
[SPEAKER_20]: There's always another space.

64
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:46,468
[SPEAKER_20]: But what happens on High Street, Salem Street, Riverside Ave, move the car, lose your space, tough luck, there may not be another one available.

65
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:51,210
[SPEAKER_20]: There are also many rumors out there that upset my employees.

66
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:53,595
[SPEAKER_20]: And these might just be rumors.

67
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:59,600
[SPEAKER_20]: That is that next year, it will be $400 for permits for employees.

68
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,263
[SPEAKER_20]: I would lose most of my help as they are part-time.

69
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:09,988
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I say, these are rumors, but why not let it be clear to what's going on next year?

70
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:15,573
[SPEAKER_20]: Even the transcript said tokens may be available to merchants.

71
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,363
[SPEAKER_20]: to buy at discount prices to hand out to their customers.

72
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:22,704
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not meter maids.

73
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:24,925
[SPEAKER_20]: We have enough on our plate to take care of.

74
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:26,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for listening to me.

75
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,848
[SPEAKER_20]: This has been a real problem.

76
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,328
[SPEAKER_20]: It has affected business.

77
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:35,551
[SPEAKER_20]: It has affected the feelings Medford citizens have about Medford.

78
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:41,435
[SPEAKER_20]: We love Medford, but we have been really, you know, in a tough way to do business.

79
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:42,756
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

80
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:44,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for coming up, ma'am.

81
00:06:45,798 --> 00:07:01,826
[SPEAKER_14]: And please know that the council hears your concerns, and that we have been working to get the record straight on many of your concerns.

82
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:13,232
[SPEAKER_14]: And in two weeks, we'll have a Committee of the Whole meeting with the Traffic Commission, which has authority over the new parking program, to have them report back to us

83
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:22,858
[SPEAKER_14]: on some of the changes that they've made and to hear some of our additional concerns regarding all those matters.

84
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:24,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta.

85
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Elsie, could you just come?

86
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you come up please?

87
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta has a question for you.

88
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:37,812
[SPEAKER_08]: You made a comment that related to the fact that you have a handicap placard and you've been tagged three times?

89
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, three times.

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,961
[SPEAKER_08]: And you, did you relate that to the chief of police?

91
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:47,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, one time I was tagged out, uh, probably in January, my handicap, uh, ticket was up.

92
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,385
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, I went to the pay to park office.

93
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:51,405
[SPEAKER_20]: It was ironed out.

94
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:55,146
[SPEAKER_20]: I got one again last Friday, went up yesterday.

95
00:07:55,827 --> 00:08:08,692
[SPEAKER_20]: And when, uh, the lady, a very nice lady called Pam looked up the records, she excused that, uh, Friday ticket, but she also saw that I got one on February 14th, which I was not aware of.

96
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:15,161
[SPEAKER_20]: The ticket had gone up from $25 now to $50 because it was not paid in 21 days.

97
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:23,603
[SPEAKER_20]: I said to her, had I known I had a ticket, I would have been right up here just like I was for the ticket I thought that I got last Friday.

98
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:26,023
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I didn't know about the ticket.

99
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:36,126
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, they're lightweight, they weigh what, same weight as you get on a stopping shop, you know, receipt, thank you.

100
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:39,474
[SPEAKER_20]: And in that weather, it could have been blown away.

101
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:43,378
[SPEAKER_20]: I could have scraped it off with moving the snow off the window.

102
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,560
[SPEAKER_20]: I was not aware of it.

103
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,146
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, Mr. President, and anyone who might be listening, this is just symptomatic as to what's going on with Republic's attitude here in the city of Medford.

104
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:58,211
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a resolution further on into the agenda that will address some of these things.

105
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,674
[SPEAKER_08]: But attacking a person, so to speak, with a handicapped spot

106
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:06,943
[SPEAKER_08]: These people, it's obvious that they're not trained properly.

107
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:07,923
[SPEAKER_08]: They're out-of-towners.

108
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:09,843
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as I'm concerned, they're bounty hunters.

109
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:14,685
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just coming in here to make as much money as they can at the expense of the taxpayers and small business.

110
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:22,606
[SPEAKER_08]: So, when we get to this conversation, Mr. President, as I asked you before, when we have our meeting in some two weeks, this is a serious issue.

111
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:26,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Tagging people, especially people that have a handicapped placard, that's just not right.

112
00:09:27,187 --> 00:09:33,569
[SPEAKER_08]: And that shows a complete dereliction of somebody's duty to their job, knowing who they should tag and who they shouldn't tag.

113
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,656
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thank you for bringing that forward.

114
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:39,640
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I've seen many different fellows out there in the cars.

115
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:41,662
[SPEAKER_20]: I wish they were Medford citizens.

116
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:43,784
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like our money to go to Medford citizens.

117
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:46,187
[SPEAKER_20]: So I see that this program pays.

118
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:49,059
[SPEAKER_20]: for so many outsiders to get a paycheck.

119
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,642
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's at the, you know, it's the merchants and the citizens that are paying.

120
00:09:54,162 --> 00:10:03,328
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wish, I truly wish a lot more money would go to Medford so we can see the results and everybody, commons who comes to the salon.

121
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,851
[SPEAKER_20]: But we really feel under the gun all the time in the shop.

122
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:10,873
[SPEAKER_20]: We're constantly monitoring.

123
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:11,553
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you pay?

124
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:12,174
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you pay?

125
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:12,834
[SPEAKER_20]: Have you paid?

126
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:19,225
[SPEAKER_20]: we're out there assisting, you know, we've become an accomplice to not getting paid for it either.

127
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:20,566
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

128
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,087
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

129
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:21,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

130
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:23,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

131
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:30,473
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Penta to receive and place on file or refer to the committee of the whole meeting for two weeks hence.

132
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:30,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

133
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

134
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:36,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

135
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:42,622
[SPEAKER_22]: Additionally, Mr. President, this council has been on record on several occasions requesting that

136
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:48,246
[SPEAKER_22]: Republic be able to turn off the machines when they're not supposed to be in operation.

137
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:52,249
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know just recently we voted unanimously to have that done.

138
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:56,391
[SPEAKER_22]: The hours of operation now are 8 a.m.

139
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:57,372
[SPEAKER_22]: to 6 p.m.

140
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:01,255
[SPEAKER_22]: And these machines are accepting money prior to 8 a.m.

141
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:02,796
[SPEAKER_22]: and after 6 p.m.

142
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:08,380
[SPEAKER_22]: We met tonight for a community block grant public service proposals.

143
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:16,609
[SPEAKER_22]: And one of the human service agencies, the Consumer Advisory Commission, came before us for additional funding.

144
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:27,251
[SPEAKER_22]: And I mentioned to the director of the program that this issue with the kiosk has been a long, ongoing issue and something that they should review.

145
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:38,573
[SPEAKER_22]: And I ask that this council go on record and send a letter to the Consumer Advisory Commission asking if they can intervene on behalf of every Medford resident

146
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:51,337
[SPEAKER_22]: to make sure these machines are not capable of accepting money before or after the hours of operation, and also that it's publicly posted throughout the community what the exact hours of operation are.

147
00:11:51,958 --> 00:12:01,785
[SPEAKER_22]: It's very misrepresenting for residents that are trying to do business in the square to try to figure out whether or not they have to pay the kiosk, Mr. President.

148
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:05,548
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would ask that in the form of a motion tonight, Mr. President.

149
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:06,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

150
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:10,970
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of council, Penter as amended by Councilor Marks, council Longo current.

151
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,970
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, president Delaware.

152
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,292
[SPEAKER_23]: So you, so we're having a meeting on the 21st, Tuesday, the 21st, 22nd, Wednesday.

153
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:18,273
[SPEAKER_23]: What time?

154
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:22,794
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're calling it for six to seven 30 and the council chambers.

155
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:29,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, the, uh, clerk is going to announce that, uh, Pence, but I'm told that all the department heads,

156
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:31,782
[SPEAKER_14]: have already received the notifications.

157
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:33,823
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I hope Republic's present.

158
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:36,005
[SPEAKER_23]: I just, I feel like that is almost.

159
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:37,625
[SPEAKER_14]: They were requested to be part of that.

160
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:39,366
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not soon enough.

161
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:43,609
[SPEAKER_23]: Within the last few days, I've got complaints with regards to Council Pentis concerns.

162
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:47,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Still no signage on the vehicles that are handing out the tickets.

163
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:55,336
[SPEAKER_23]: I've got complaints about people waiting in line to pay the parking meter and turn around and they have a ticket.

164
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:57,657
[SPEAKER_23]: And I've had people who are getting ticketed

165
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:04,846
[SPEAKER_23]: after they already paid within the time frame that's allowable for them to be parked in the proper parking spot.

166
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:08,629
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I mean, that's just in the last few days, and we've been getting complaints.

167
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,871
[SPEAKER_23]: It's almost a little bit out of control.

168
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:17,896
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, they should have guidelines, they should be properly trained, and Republic needs to take responsibility for this.

169
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:27,723
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody shouldn't have to go with a handicapped parking spot, or somebody shouldn't have to go who was waiting in line or who actually did pay, take the time out of their busy schedules,

170
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:30,754
[SPEAKER_23]: and go to the parking office to get it taken care of.

171
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:32,834
[SPEAKER_23]: And the chief of police has been great.

172
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:38,596
[SPEAKER_23]: If somebody contacts one of us or probably the mayor's office, we can get it all squared away and figured out.

173
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:47,499
[SPEAKER_23]: But not everybody thinks to maybe call us or call the mayor's office, and they have to go down, take the time out of their work schedule, and get it taken care of.

174
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:51,326
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, the resident was right.

175
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:53,187
[SPEAKER_23]: This was implemented at the wrong time.

176
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:56,667
[SPEAKER_23]: And not only that, it's just not performed properly.

177
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:58,588
[SPEAKER_23]: It's very frustrating.

178
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:00,828
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, I look forward to the meeting on the 22nd.

179
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:04,829
[SPEAKER_23]: Hopefully we can get a lot accomplished and a lot resolved for our business people and our residents.

180
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:07,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

181
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:11,470
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Penta, Councilor Penta.

182
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Just real quick on Councilor Lungo-Koehn's comments.

183
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I have pictures here of just this past week and as late as yesterday.

184
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:39,461
[SPEAKER_08]: with these trucks driving around, driving around, unmarked, in particular locations within the city, on the ring road, and designated spots where they're not supposed to be, giving out tickets at 7.38 a.m., which is supposed to not start until 8 o'clock in the morning, and we can continue on and on and on.

185
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:46,947
[SPEAKER_08]: This is in complete violation of the contract on page four of the contract that they have with the city of Medford.

186
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:49,919
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I know, Mr. President, you're having the meeting on the 23rd.

187
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,920
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't know how much can be resolved by then.

188
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,741
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's quite obvious.

189
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:54,882
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll just end it by saying this.

190
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:59,024
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they had the contract signed on October 10th of 2014.

191
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:06,688
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had the luxury from October 10th, 2014, to January 15th, when it was supposed to be implemented, and strike that first day of implementation.

192
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:11,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And on February 3rd, it was Councilor Caraviello's resolution offered before the council.

193
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Because at that point in time, from January 15th to February 2nd,

194
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:17,139
[SPEAKER_08]: The screens were so light and hard to read.

195
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:18,959
[SPEAKER_08]: The resolution was put on there.

196
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:26,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we speak today on April 7th, they're still the same way, hard to read, almost illegible, especially if the sun is out.

197
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:28,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can go through a whole litany of other things beside that.

198
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:29,982
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just obvious.

199
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:32,643
[SPEAKER_08]: And their public relations, it just doesn't work.

200
00:15:32,703 --> 00:15:44,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe they had no human resource background on teaching the folks that are going to work here in this city how to handle the people, talk to the people, whether it's permit parking, whether it's just giving people out tickets and what have you.

201
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:47,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this has been a complete disaster, Mr. President.

202
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:49,775
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Mayor McGlynn's program.

203
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:51,855
[SPEAKER_08]: He owns it lock, stock, and barrel.

204
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:59,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And if anyone has a concern, as you continue to have concerns, please call his office and tell him that you're dissatisfied and you want resolution to these problems.

205
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:06,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think the council is speaking up each and every week on behalf of the taxpayers, but the mayor is the one and the only one that can resolve it.

206
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:07,701
[SPEAKER_08]: He signed the contract.

207
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:08,981
[SPEAKER_08]: This is his ballgame.

208
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:10,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, councilor.

209
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,163
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Prenta,

210
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:16,195
[SPEAKER_14]: As amended by Councilor Marks, sir, you wish to address us?

211
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,135
[SPEAKER_14]: State your name and address for the record, please.

212
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:19,296
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

213
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:20,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

214
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:32,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I understand that there's going to be a committee of the whole being held on the 22nd, I wish to request two pieces, articles of information from Republic Parking so we can review from the public.

215
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:39,862
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is on their contract attachment on page 11, the operator's personnel.

216
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:53,384
[SPEAKER_02]: The operator acknowledges its responsibility to submit a recruitment plan that includes a description of its strategy to hire local residents, which shall include recruitment fairs, local print, radio, and Internet advertisements.

217
00:16:54,124 --> 00:17:00,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not aware of any plan that has been posted, so one could be reviewed by the public before the Committee of the Whole.

218
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,889
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be of great help to me, so we can prepare.

219
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:12,312
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing I wish to ask for, if we could actually see the daily sales receipts that Republic Parking has posted.

220
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:18,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not been able to access any of those online daily receipts that they've received.

221
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:25,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm most interested in the money that they've received after 6 o'clock, because I know that the meters are still running.

222
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:32,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important for the city to know the money that they have acquired that is illegal.

223
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:33,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

224
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

225
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:35,434
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion.

226
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:36,595
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

227
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:38,056
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

228
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:39,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion carries.

229
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:42,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please mark Councilor Camuso as present.

230
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,903
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business.

231
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:47,683
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

232
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:48,844
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

233
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:51,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Accommodations 15-302.

234
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to City Hall, to Medford City Council Chambers.

235
00:17:56,122 --> 00:18:05,230
[SPEAKER_14]: the Greater Boston League Champion Medford High School Gymnastics Team, and the Greater Boston League Champion Medford High Girls Basketball Team.

236
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:08,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, you had these resolutions before us.

237
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:11,356
[SPEAKER_14]: If you'd like to come up and assume command.

238
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:12,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

239
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:16,661
[SPEAKER_14]: And welcome up the recipients of these good awards.

240
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:52,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to come up here this evening and present the 2014-2015 Medford High School varsity girls basketball team with accommodation, recognizing their GBL championship season.

241
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Girls, you've made the city of Medford very proud.

242
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Keep up the good work.

243
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:57,903
[SPEAKER_17]: They've had a conversation with their coach.

244
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,002
[SPEAKER_17]: We could ask Coach Burke to come up here and join me in the presentation.

245
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:27,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Coach Burke's explained to me what a great group of individuals that he has on his team.

246
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,053
[SPEAKER_17]: They're both great athletes on the basketball court, and they're also very good in the classroom.

247
00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:36,276
[SPEAKER_17]: They're young, committed, Medfordites that have blue and white in their veins that have done great.

248
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:41,339
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to read into the record the citation.

249
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:58,805
[SPEAKER_17]: The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to the Medford High School Girls Varsity Basketball Team in recognition of winning the Greater Boston League title and a playoff berth in the MIAA Division I North Girls Basketball Tournament for the 2014-2015 season.

00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:07,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to take a moment to introduce Coach Burke and say a couple of words on behalf of the team.

265
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:21,435
[SPEAKER_26]: On behalf of the girls basketball team, I'd like to thank the council for having us up here to acknowledge us going 6-0 in the GBL.

266
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:26,959
[SPEAKER_26]: It's our fourth year out of the last six that we've won the GBL and two out of the last three years we've gone undefeated.

267
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:35,473
[SPEAKER_26]: We graduate six girls this year, but we have six returning girls to keep the tradition going in our JV and freshman program.

268
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:36,634
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we'll add to it also.

269
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:37,554
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

270
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:52,079
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's also important to point out, girls, that Councilor Lungo was a star on the basketball team back in the late 90s.

271
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:07,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Also joining us this evening, folks, will be the Medford High School gymnastics team, the 2014-2015 GBL champions.

272
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:20,722
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd ask Coach Fortino or Coach Small, if they're in attendance, to come join me on stage.

273
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:49,381

274

[SPEAKER_17]: You can hold the cartwheels till the end.

277
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:27,626
[SPEAKER_15]: The next citation will go to Dominique Savoia.

00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Madison Cavello.

282
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:33,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Victor Ho.

283
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:45,954
Renee Staudt.

284
00:27:14,536 --> 00:27:25,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Erica Lavoie.

285
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:33,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Camila Ribeiro.

286

00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:37,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Abby Klein Olivia Ross

289
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:52,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Samantha Alberino.

290
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:09,573
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd just like to introduce Coach.

291
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:11,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Coach Small is going to say a few words about the girls.

292
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:16,823
[SPEAKER_21]: It was actually a really good year this year.

293
00:29:16,843 --> 00:29:22,286
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a lot of injuries, so the fact that we took back our GBL title from 2010, we're very excited about.

294
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:22,766
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

295
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:43,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

296
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:15,384
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello for suspension of the rules, to take a presentation from the audience.

297
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:16,705
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

298
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:17,445
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

299
00:30:18,105 --> 00:30:27,230
[SPEAKER_14]: The City Council, in the past two weeks, has asked representative of Lawrence Memorial Hospital, Hallmark Health, to be present and speak with us.

300
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:31,613
[SPEAKER_14]: So at this time, we invite Alan McDonald to address the council.

301
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:35,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, President Alan McDonald.

302
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:45,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, members of the council, Madam President, members of the council, thank you for having me come in tonight.

303
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:54,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that there's an opportunity for me to talk about what we've been doing at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital campus on noise control.

304
00:30:55,135 --> 00:31:06,880
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have been working on an issue that came up even two years ago when one of the neighbors did call and I was lucky to get the call and have a chance to visit with a neighbor.

305
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:14,274
[SPEAKER_10]: and work on getting an engineering firm to come in and look at noise that was happening.

306
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:19,978
[SPEAKER_10]: We found from a whistle over the operating room at Lawrence that was making a shrill sound.

307
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:22,440
[SPEAKER_10]: We replaced a bearing on that whistle.

308
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:36,991
[SPEAKER_10]: We put some what we call attenuators across the air ducts along Lawrence Road that greatly reduced the sound of air vents when the air is coming in and the fans are going.

309
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:52,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And we actually had over the course of the last year and a half a few visits from the State Department of Environmental Protection and from the Medford Department of Public Health to take a look at what the noise situation was at Lawrence.

310
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:59,019
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have not been able to identify any noise that has not been limited so far.

311
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:03,540
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that there's at least one neighbor that has not been

312
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:07,706
[SPEAKER_10]: satisfied with the work that has been done, and I feel badly about that.

313
00:32:07,766 --> 00:32:14,209
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have said that we will continue to monitor, and any sounds that can be identified that we can address, we are going to do that.

314
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:21,711
[SPEAKER_10]: We just haven't been able to identify ourselves any sounds that are going on that we can limit.

315
00:32:22,092 --> 00:32:25,893
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually take decibel readings two and three times a day on the property.

316
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:30,815
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have, in discussion with the inspectors for both the

317
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:35,120
[SPEAKER_10]: and for the city looked at possibilities.

318
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:49,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've had everything from that could be sound coming off the barriers on route 93 and from traffic to it could be some kind of air transfer that's going on, but not identifiable.

319
00:32:49,506 --> 00:32:52,487
[SPEAKER_10]: So we keep, we keep working on it, Mr. President.

320
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:56,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. McDonald.

321
00:32:57,869 --> 00:32:58,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, if you could,

322
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:10,486
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the council is going to want, if you could, in a nutshell, bring us up to date on the transfer merger ownership issues regarding the hospital as well.

323
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:14,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta?

324
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:26,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, you indicated that you've done a host of issues as it relates to hopefully remediating the noise.

325
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:30,193
[SPEAKER_08]: at that particular point.

326
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:35,657
[SPEAKER_08]: My question to you is this, as I'm talking, I'm looking for your email.

327
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:52,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that you sent to one of the residents as it relates to noise being loud enough or disturbing enough that you folks would be offering space in your hospital for her to run her business.

328
00:33:54,878 --> 00:34:00,319
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the difference between that time till now if the noise issue is still the same?

329
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:11,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we would be very pleased to address the noise issue to limit the noise if we could identify together what the noise is that we're talking about.

330
00:34:11,761 --> 00:34:19,063
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't, we've looked at even, I've been looking at a letter that I took out today from

331
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:31,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year when we wrote to the State Department of Public Health during our public hearing process that I could leave if it's good enough to leave with a council to give you an idea of some of the things that

332
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:36,094
[SPEAKER_10]: We've talked with the State Department of Public Health about, could I do that?

333
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:45,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that would be, it is informative as to some of the work that we did do as far as the engineering firm that we did hire.

334
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,521
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually hired a couple of different engineering firms.

335
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:56,466
[SPEAKER_10]: One that helped us with the, what they call attenuators on the louvers, the air vents on Lawrence Road.

336
00:34:56,966 --> 00:35:00,368
[SPEAKER_10]: And another one who looked at what we might do to the air conditioning

337
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:01,307
[SPEAKER_10]: units.

338
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:10,251
[SPEAKER_10]: We understand that the noise that causes problems is in the winter as well as the summer, so we don't think it's got to do with air conditioning.

339
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:16,053
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are concerned that it might have to do with traffic as much as anything else.

340
00:35:16,453 --> 00:35:20,975
[SPEAKER_10]: But we haven't been able to identify something that we could address.

341
00:35:21,675 --> 00:35:29,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at a note that came from the State Department of Public Health last year when they were looking at the property.

342
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:44,154
[SPEAKER_10]: to say that actually it was a note to Mrs. Casey on Terrace Road who said that this gentleman with the State Department of Public Health had talked with the Medford Board of Health regarding the noise issue.

343
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:51,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said that they suspect the noise may be coming from the sound barriers along the highway rather than the hospital.

344
00:35:51,736 --> 00:35:59,378
[SPEAKER_10]: And he says the next step is to have a gentleman from the Department of Environmental Protection conduct a tone test to get an accurate reading.

345
00:35:59,438 --> 00:36:00,278
[SPEAKER_10]: That was last summer.

346
00:36:00,878 --> 00:36:01,739
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was done.

347
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:09,644
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had some unannounced visits from both the State and the City Department of Public Health.

348
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:18,269
[SPEAKER_10]: And they took decibel readings and began tracking the readings and did not find any noise issues to deal with.

349
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:22,172
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was the difficulty we had with the report.

350
00:36:22,212 --> 00:36:28,796
[SPEAKER_10]: This is from the Medford City noise measurement report, which says no significant findings.

351
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:29,656
[SPEAKER_10]: This is August of 2014.

352
00:36:31,425 --> 00:36:37,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Multiple visits to the area trying to capture when noise was described to be louder continued to yield no findings.

353
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:46,915
[SPEAKER_10]: It is not clear what is causing the noise, even though it may be a continuous noise irritating to the occupant of a home on Terrace Road.

354
00:36:47,435 --> 00:36:49,016
[SPEAKER_10]: And we keep looking for that.

355
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:50,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we'd love to address it, frankly.

356
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:51,258
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

357
00:36:52,298 --> 00:36:58,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, through you to the chair, I have a letter here dated September 6, 2013, for which you addressed to me.

358
00:37:01,682 --> 00:37:09,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And in that letter, you addressed two particular issues, one regarding the positive effects if, in fact, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital does go in effect into a merger.

359
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:11,407
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have an unending paragraph.

360
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:21,772
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, on a second matter, which is about the noise emitted into the neighborhood from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we have contracted with a firm to install covers over the air intakes at LMH.

361
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:24,053
[SPEAKER_08]: The installation is scheduled for next Friday.

362
00:37:24,213 --> 00:37:30,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It should reduce the sound a great deal, and we hope it will provide relief to the neighbors needed.

363
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:39,312
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is an acknowledgment dating back to 2013 that the hospital acknowledges that there's an issue of noise in the neighborhood.

364
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:52,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if the state is coming in or the city is coming in, and maybe they're not there on a 24-hour basis, they may be just coming in there and putting up one of those ear monitor machines and seeing if they hear.

365
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:55,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally was in the hospital in a doctor's office.

366
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:59,678
[SPEAKER_08]: that faces the Lawrence Road side.

367
00:37:59,998 --> 00:38:01,679
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could hear it in the doctor's office.

368
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it consistent?

369
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:03,541
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

370
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:06,083
[SPEAKER_08]: But it did run in intermittent periods of time.

371
00:38:06,763 --> 00:38:11,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I believe it was some two to three weeks ago, the resident, Mrs. Casey, appeared before the council.

372
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:23,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe, and I could be wrong because I know she's sitting there, she had what she had, what I believe, which is an independent contractor who would be willing to come in and service, I believe it was a $400 or $500 fee.

373
00:38:26,352 --> 00:38:36,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I could be reading this wrong, but my impression was that I believe that she would accept and hopefully the hospital would accept whatever the findings might be that would make resolution to the matter.

374
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:38,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mrs. Casey is there.

375
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,201
[SPEAKER_08]: She can speak for herself, but I think that's the way I understood it.

376
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:46,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And that should not be at her cost.

377
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:53,747
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be at the hospital's cost because the track record exists that you folks at the hospital before you became CEO, and I wish you good luck.

378
00:38:54,301 --> 00:39:00,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but more importantly, you know, the neighborhood right now is an issue and it's, it'll always be an issue as long as that hospital is there.

379
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:05,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, first of all, I want to say thank you very much for, for your good wishes.

380
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:14,255
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, I also want to say, I really, uh, respect what the council does in this case, in all cases.

381
00:39:14,355 --> 00:39:20,239
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel that I'm working for the Medford city council and all the residents of Medford in the job that I have now.

382
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a tremendous public asset that this hospital is,

383
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:27,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want it to be as strong and good for the community as possible.

384
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:34,366
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel that I'm representing the same folks that you represent, and that I'm working for you and for the citizens.

385
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:36,207
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to do a good job with that hospital.

386
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:37,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Very, very much so.

387
00:39:37,947 --> 00:39:38,967
[SPEAKER_08]: The only difference is this.

388
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:41,388
[SPEAKER_08]: You make a lot more money than we do.

389
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:43,008
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the difference.

390
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:46,209
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have to do a good job to stay in your position.

391
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:48,589
[SPEAKER_08]: The people can throw us out at any time.

392
00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:50,890
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're stuck there with a good salary.

393
00:39:53,262 --> 00:39:55,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to do the job, whether I get paid or not.

394
00:39:55,743 --> 00:40:00,544
[SPEAKER_10]: I was 20 years a volunteer for LMH and Hallmark Health before I worked for them.

395
00:40:01,385 --> 00:40:06,746
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been 26 years active with the hospital, only the last three working for them.

396
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:11,247
[SPEAKER_10]: 23 years as a volunteer because I love the place so much, and I want to do a good job.

397
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:13,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether they pay me or they don't pay me, I want to do a good job.

398
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:19,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just say, if I could, Mr. President, I did not know that she had come in and talked about the $400, $500.

399
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:24,439
[SPEAKER_10]: We spent $25,000 on those covers for the air vents.

400
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,201
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not a problem of the $400.

401
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:39,129
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually have spent altogether some $50,000 plus in responding to the comments that we've heard from Mrs. Casey, trying very hard to please her and do the things that she wants to have done.

402
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,670
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not $400.

403
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,510
[SPEAKER_10]: We're over $50,000 already.

404
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:41,791
[SPEAKER_10]: But I understand that.

405
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:47,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Your own e-mails acknowledge the fact that a noise problem did exist.

406
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:52,092
[SPEAKER_08]: And however they've been resolved, mitigated or whatever they might be, so be it.

407
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:54,233
[SPEAKER_08]: But can we have Mrs. Casey just answer that question?

408
00:40:55,294 --> 00:40:56,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this will resolve the whole problem.

409
00:40:57,495 --> 00:40:58,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Could I say before that?

410
00:40:58,576 --> 00:40:58,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

411
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:04,699
[SPEAKER_10]: That letter of September 13, that was prior to putting on the covers over the events.

412
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,861
[SPEAKER_10]: So we put the covers over the events in September of 13.

413
00:41:08,882 --> 00:41:11,884
[SPEAKER_10]: And the measurements I talked about here were August of 14.

414
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:19,867
[SPEAKER_10]: These are reports that came in from the State Department of Environmental Protection and the Medford Department of Health in August of 2014.

415
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:26,873
[SPEAKER_10]: The Ubers were covered in September of 13, that's when I wrote to you, September 13, that we were studying it.

416
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:28,635
[SPEAKER_10]: And we took the recommendation.

417
00:41:29,096 --> 00:41:37,444
[SPEAKER_10]: We spent $25,000, it had nothing to do with the money, but we decided that we wanted to do it as we could, and that was, so we acted on it.

418
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:40,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't want you to think we didn't do anything.

419
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's saying that.

420
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, just want this problem resolved and to go away.

421
00:41:45,782 --> 00:41:48,463
[SPEAKER_08]: So could we just, can we have Mrs. Casey just answer that question?

422
00:41:49,103 --> 00:41:49,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

423
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:53,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Casey, if you would, please state your name and address for the record.

424
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:54,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

425
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:54,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

426
00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:57,267
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Michelle Casey and I live at 98 Terrace Road.

427
00:41:57,728 --> 00:41:58,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks again for having me back.

428
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:06,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I have done some research and I have contacted two independent acoustical engineering firms.

429
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:15,126
[SPEAKER_12]: And what has been told to me is that if they do come into my home, they can run testing to determine, in fact, what the noise is.

430
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:21,211
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what I am requesting, that that work takes place and that we can get a resolution to this.

431
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:26,475
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I will acknowledge, you know, Mr. McDonald and I have had communication back and forth.

432
00:42:27,135 --> 00:42:33,741
[SPEAKER_12]: But at this point, you know, I need to have my home so that my family and I can live in my home.

433
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:34,781
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

434
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. McDonald, you can continue if you'd like.

435
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:44,843
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just only wondering, and I'm not opposed to doing more testing at all.

436
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:56,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will talk with Mrs. Casey about it, but I don't understand how the testing inside the house is going to identify the noise outside at Lawrence Memorial's campus.

437
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,132
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, maybe it would, but I don't know.

438
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:07,717
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not an engineer, but I'm wondering how the testing that we've done all over the campus on the roofs of the hospital

439
00:43:08,644 --> 00:43:11,666
[SPEAKER_10]: in by the Air National?

440
00:43:12,486 --> 00:43:19,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, the report that I sent you does state the work that they would do in an acoustical engineering firm when they come in.

441
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:24,893
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're able to measure the noise from inside a contained facility, which would be my home.

442
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:30,496
[SPEAKER_12]: So they are, in fact, there's many engineers out there, acoustical engineers out there, that will do it.

443
00:43:30,656 --> 00:43:36,980
[SPEAKER_12]: And I did find someone local in Cambridge that can, in fact, do that and determine what the noise is.

444
00:43:37,471 --> 00:43:40,292
[SPEAKER_12]: and hopefully come up with a solution to mitigate it.

445
00:43:40,332 --> 00:43:42,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we just can't live in our home.

446
00:43:42,293 --> 00:43:43,813
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the fact.

447
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:46,034
[SPEAKER_12]: The noise is just there.

448
00:43:46,094 --> 00:43:47,094
[SPEAKER_12]: We cannot escape it.

449
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:47,914
[SPEAKER_12]: You know that.

450
00:43:48,014 --> 00:43:49,955
[SPEAKER_12]: I've told you that many, many times to your face.

451
00:43:50,935 --> 00:43:52,976
[SPEAKER_12]: But I need to be able to live in my home.

452
00:43:53,036 --> 00:43:54,257
[SPEAKER_12]: I pay taxes in Medford.

453
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:57,378
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to have some peace in my home.

454
00:43:59,735 --> 00:44:01,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to solve it, really would.

455
00:44:02,036 --> 00:44:11,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, and I understand that, I know Mrs. Casey's been there a long time, that there was not the noise for a long time, and that it's the last four years or so.

456
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:19,684
[SPEAKER_10]: But we don't know, we've not done anything different in the last four years, but we don't know why there would be a noise the last four years, but not before that.

457
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:20,684
[SPEAKER_10]: We just can't figure it out.

458
00:44:20,884 --> 00:44:27,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I did send to the former president the two independent acoustical engineering firms,

459
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:34,892
[SPEAKER_12]: And I did ask for him to look into it and to contract with these folks to get a resolution.

460
00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:39,493
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully now, with you being the president, that you'll be able to help me with this issue.

461
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:40,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's great.

462
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:44,435
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was not aware of that request that they have him take care of it.

463
00:44:44,555 --> 00:44:47,936
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the first I heard of that.

464
00:44:48,597 --> 00:44:49,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we can do it.

465
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:50,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we can do that.

466
00:44:53,158 --> 00:45:03,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess blind, you know, I don't want to say that I endorse the acoustical engineer without knowing who the firm is, but... I actually copied you on that email.

467
00:45:03,983 --> 00:45:06,705
[SPEAKER_12]: You should have that in your email that I sent a couple months ago.

468
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:10,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll talk about that and maybe that's something we can do.

469
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:13,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly, the expense is not the problem.

470
00:45:13,408 --> 00:45:14,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't think it's that.

471
00:45:14,288 --> 00:45:19,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just getting to a final resolution and maybe this outside independent of both of you can bring

472
00:45:20,088 --> 00:45:21,069
[SPEAKER_08]: resolution to the problem.

473
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:22,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think she would be willing to accept it as well.

474
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

475
00:45:24,731 --> 00:45:25,371
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you all.

476
00:45:25,511 --> 00:45:27,092
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, Councilor curve yellow.

477
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:28,213
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

478
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:33,916
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, I want to thank Mr. McDonald for coming down here and, and Mrs. Casey, and hopefully the two years can work something.

479
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:38,238
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the $400 is a small price to pay for everyone's peace of mind.

480
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:42,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

481
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:46,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

482
00:45:46,983 --> 00:45:47,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

483
00:45:47,323 --> 00:45:48,204
[SPEAKER_13]: And Councilor Camuso.

484
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:49,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

485
00:45:49,996 --> 00:45:57,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said what I had to say regarding the noise a few weeks ago, that I was sure the Lawrence Memorial Hospital would do whatever they could under his leadership.

486
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:04,988
[SPEAKER_07]: But this evening, I would like to publicly thank, number one, and congratulate Mr. McDonald.

487
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:11,213
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's no one better, no one better, in my eyes, to run our local hospital.

488
00:46:11,713 --> 00:46:16,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone that's volunteered there, has been a member of the board for 20-plus years.

489
00:46:17,455 --> 00:46:19,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's committed to this community.

490
00:46:20,397 --> 00:46:36,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we're on the bigger horizon of possibly merging with an international institute that's known for medicine throughout the world, I don't think there's anyone better that could be in charge than Mr. McDonald.

491
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:41,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So as a city, we're very lucky that we have this young gentleman here.

492
00:46:41,571 --> 00:46:43,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to wish you well in your new position.

493
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:46,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And very, very, very responsive.

494
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:58,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had a column three times in the last few months and gets back to the same day and meets the needs of this community every time that something within reasonableness is requested of them.

495
00:46:59,269 --> 00:46:59,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

496
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for those comments.

497
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it very much.

498
00:47:05,971 --> 00:47:09,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you what my loyalty and my heart is right here.

499
00:47:09,372 --> 00:47:13,472
[SPEAKER_10]: My dad ran in 1936 for the city council and didn't make it.

500
00:47:13,492 --> 00:47:15,433
[SPEAKER_10]: He lost by 16 votes of getting on.

501
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:15,953
[SPEAKER_10]: But, uh,

502
00:47:16,488 --> 00:47:18,648
[SPEAKER_10]: He stayed active in Medford over his lifetime.

503
00:47:18,688 --> 00:47:23,889
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and when I got involved in the late eighties at the Lawrence, it was in his name and I'm still doing it.

504
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:31,231
[SPEAKER_10]: And I come here and I think of him, how much he would love to be sitting with you gentlemen and madam, madam president yourself.

505
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:32,991
[SPEAKER_10]: He would love to be sitting right here with you.

506
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:33,871
[SPEAKER_10]: No question about it.

507
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:39,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, you wanted to ask me, Mr. President, a little bit about the potential affiliation.

508
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:40,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

509
00:47:40,952 --> 00:47:44,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we have a council max, uh, next.

510
00:47:45,494 --> 00:47:51,897
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be brief, Mr. President, but I think the last piece of the puzzle would be this acoustical engineering study.

511
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:54,859
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll take a snapshot of what's happening in the house.

512
00:47:55,399 --> 00:47:57,460
[SPEAKER_22]: If we can pinpoint, it might be something internal.

513
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,000
[SPEAKER_22]: Who knows?

514
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,841
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe it's something within your own home.

515
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:00,701
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't know.

516
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:02,602
[SPEAKER_22]: But we'll find out from this study.

517
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:08,825
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it'll be worth its weight in gold, President, to have it done and move forward on this issue.

518
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:10,066
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you have a lot on your plate.

519
00:48:10,706 --> 00:48:14,168
[SPEAKER_22]: And although you want to address these issues, I'm sure you want to get this behind you.

520
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:17,543
[SPEAKER_22]: I look forward to seeing this done within the next several weeks.

521
00:48:18,223 --> 00:48:18,583
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

522
00:48:18,843 --> 00:48:20,504
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

523
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:21,565
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

524
00:48:21,585 --> 00:48:27,947
[SPEAKER_23]: I also want to thank Mr. McDonald for agreeing to do the study at the home, and I, too, hope it's done within the next few weeks.

525
00:48:28,347 --> 00:48:36,390
[SPEAKER_23]: And if we could, through the chair, if we could get a report on that study, if possible, that would be greatly appreciated so we know the outcome.

526
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

527
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:42,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So Mr. McDonald will share the outcome of that report with the council.

528
00:48:42,932 --> 00:48:44,493
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be greatly appreciated.

529
00:48:45,038 --> 00:48:51,640
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you could, now, at this time, just in Noochay, bring the council up to date on the merger process.

530
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Sperling.

531
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Very briefly, Mr. President.

532
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,441
[SPEAKER_10]: We still continue to have discussions with the Partners Healthcare.

533
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:14,326
[SPEAKER_10]: We determined that the number one future for the Hallmark Health Complex, which is Lawrence Memorial Hospital of Medford and Melrose-Wakefield Hospital, Clinic and Reading Cancer Care at Stoneham, is to be working with

534
00:49:15,258 --> 00:49:29,529
[SPEAKER_10]: The Mass General Hospital and Partners Network, they dearly love, as you heard Dr. Torciana here in the fall of 2013, they dearly love the opportunity to invest some of their resources in these communities.

535
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:36,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford particularly and Melrose-Wakefield where the larger installations are for Hallmark Health.

536
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:43,620
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, we had a consent agreement from Attorney General Martha Coakley which would have allowed that to go forward.

537
00:49:44,753 --> 00:49:50,397
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was dismissed by the court with new Attorney General Maura Healey at the start of this year.

538
00:49:51,077 --> 00:50:10,008
[SPEAKER_10]: We continue to meet with the Attorney General and with partners to look for an opportunity to show the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, working hard with the Commonwealth, that putting together Hallmark Health and Partners Healthcare would be a tremendous asset for the communities that we serve for future generations.

539
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,790
[SPEAKER_10]: We believe it's the number one opportunity for us

540
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:24,947
[SPEAKER_10]: knowing we have to, as a community hospital system, grow into a network that can take patients pre-admission through post-discharge with tertiary academic medical center coverage.

541
00:50:24,987 --> 00:50:30,268
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what accountable care organizations are driving all of us with community hospitals toward.

542
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:35,569
[SPEAKER_10]: And we see other community hospitals merging with tertiary care centers.

543
00:50:36,229 --> 00:50:43,030
[SPEAKER_10]: And the same argument that they have that's so acceptable when they've done it is the argument we have for our communities.

544
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:55,960
[SPEAKER_10]: The difficulty we have, of course, is that Partners is the largest of the academic medical centers, and the concern is whether or not there could be anti-competitive practices if indeed we work together.

545
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,581
[SPEAKER_10]: We feel that it's not about that at all.

546
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:13,286
[SPEAKER_10]: For us, it's really about giving an opportunity for patients in the community setting to stay in the community setting, not have to go into Boston for what they need for lower acuity care, and that is something that

547
00:51:13,596 --> 00:51:22,421
[SPEAKER_10]: partners needs because they need, as an economic imperative, to find a way for patients that come into Boston, to their institution, staying in the community.

548
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:24,502
[SPEAKER_10]: We are prepared to serve those patients.

549
00:51:25,143 --> 00:51:42,973
[SPEAKER_10]: And with the combination of the investments that we can make with partners and attracting the patients to stay in the community at a lower cost, at much more convenience, and we have all of the talent in doctors and nurses to take care of those patients, we feel it's the best solution

550
00:51:43,462 --> 00:51:44,022
[SPEAKER_10]: for the future.

551
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,184
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are still engaged in those conversations.

552
00:51:47,784 --> 00:51:54,207
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have not been told yet that we don't have an opportunity to put it together.

553
00:51:54,287 --> 00:52:12,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the concern is whether or not there would be enough watchdog and restrictions over the activities of our new medical accountable care organization that we would be part of to satisfy the Commonwealth of Mass that we are not

554
00:52:13,845 --> 00:52:20,366
[SPEAKER_10]: raising prices in the healthcare system, but providing more economical and convenient opportunity for patients.

555
00:52:20,446 --> 00:52:21,927
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're working very hard at it.

556
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:28,228
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in a pause in the sense that there are no dates for public hearings or court hearings.

557
00:52:29,068 --> 00:52:30,268
[SPEAKER_10]: They're only conversations.

558
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:36,469
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that there have been press stories about a pause.

559
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:41,570
[SPEAKER_10]: The pause is not to concern ourselves with whether it's the right path.

560
00:52:42,052 --> 00:52:44,433
[SPEAKER_10]: The pause is to figure out how to make it happen.

561
00:52:45,253 --> 00:52:57,496
[SPEAKER_10]: And truthfully, it means so very much to our communities that I hope that it becomes more of a public discussion, frankly, about the importance of it to the community level.

562
00:52:57,936 --> 00:53:06,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I know a lot of the public discussion has been whether or not Partners Healthcare is too big to have this happen, and the attention's been on the bigger partner.

563
00:53:07,235 --> 00:53:08,356
[SPEAKER_10]: We're the smaller partner.

564
00:53:08,696 --> 00:53:27,206
[SPEAKER_10]: We would love a little attention on why it's so important to the community because we think that it will make a tremendous difference for the future of the residents in Medford, future of the residents in Melrose and Wakefield, Malden, Saugus, Reading, North Reading, all the places that are served.

565
00:53:27,266 --> 00:53:34,290
[SPEAKER_10]: But it would make a tremendous difference to be able to have the Lawrence serve a population of a bigger size, frankly.

566
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:49,483
[SPEAKER_10]: And it would be a tremendous advantage to the citizens of Medford to have that medical complex right there at the Roosevelt Circle, where Daniel Lawrence had a beautiful idea of putting that hospital there, because who knew that Route 93 was going to go right by?

567
00:53:49,543 --> 00:53:55,465
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so accessible, so convenient for people, not just in the city of Medford, but other places, too.

568
00:53:55,505 --> 00:54:00,626
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we had the volume of people using Lawrence, which we are prepared to handle,

569
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:05,741
[SPEAKER_10]: It would make a tremendous difference in building that complex for the future, which is what we'd love to do.

570
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:08,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Mr. McDonald.

571
00:54:09,224 --> 00:54:09,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you all.

572
00:54:09,804 --> 00:54:12,386
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

573
00:54:14,427 --> 00:54:29,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, one of the things that came out of the report from the new Attorney General Maury Healy was not only the concern of maybe lack of competition, but I believe that there were 50 other medical

574
00:54:30,077 --> 00:54:36,839
[SPEAKER_08]: senior people, doctors in hospitals, who indicated that there was no belief that those prices were going to go down.

575
00:54:36,879 --> 00:54:39,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that was one of the major issues.

576
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:55,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Another concern, if I understood it correctly, is the fact that even if this merger is or were to have taken place, the guarantee that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital would become part of the Mass General or the Partners Group did not have a beginning date.

577
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:59,506
[SPEAKER_08]: They had that five-year window, so to speak.

578
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:14,186
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think one of the concerns, because in my letter that I addressed to both attorney generals and to the judge, is that if this were to take place, I think that the licensure should become operative immediately.

579
00:55:14,527 --> 00:55:21,930
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way the city of Medford knows that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is not in a holding patent, and we're not going to be just shuffled around.

580
00:55:22,323 --> 00:55:24,824
[SPEAKER_08]: so to speak, because I'll speak for myself.

581
00:55:24,924 --> 00:55:32,288
[SPEAKER_08]: My opinion is the Melrose-Wakefield right now seems to have gotten the bigger bite of the apple of what could possibly be had here for the city of Medford.

582
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:35,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think the Lawrence Memorial is out of the ballgame at all.

583
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's still in there.

584
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:50,917
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would strongly, and I would write it again, and I would repeat my letter to whoever the attorney or the judge might be, that the Medford licensure for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital has to become an immediate decision

585
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:54,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, not a decision breaker, an immediate decision.

586
00:55:54,929 --> 00:56:09,757
[SPEAKER_08]: So the patients, the administration, the doctors, everybody knows that this hospital is alive and well, and it's not on a holding patent because that was the one thing that you did not read in the decision that was, that was rented by Martha Coakley.

587
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:11,618
[SPEAKER_08]: That licensure was not in there.

588
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,120
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know Maura Healy has a different, a different position on that.

589
00:56:15,381 --> 00:56:17,422
[SPEAKER_10]: So, well, I would say thank you.

590
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:19,623
[SPEAKER_10]: And I certainly wouldn't object to that at all.

591
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:21,164
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I know that,

592
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:34,234
[SPEAKER_10]: When Partners Healthcare, I shouldn't speak for them, can't speak for them, but I know that they are very desirous of having an active campus at Alarmist Memorial Hospital.

593
00:56:34,334 --> 00:56:39,677
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a very attractive site for them, given where Mass General Hospital is.

594
00:56:39,737 --> 00:56:43,040
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're right up the street as far as their concern and I'm concerned.

595
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:50,625
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'd be a tremendous opportunity for them to be helping us with primary and secondary care.

596
00:56:51,227 --> 00:56:58,930
[SPEAKER_10]: in a very accessible location, easily accessible to Mass General Hospital for a tertiary care for those patients that would need it from warrants.

597
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,190
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would be a tremendous advantage.

598
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,071
[SPEAKER_10]: So they see that.

599
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:11,894
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the discussion on the immediate license situation was over a three to five year program of putting everything together, because it doesn't happen overnight.

600
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:20,257
[SPEAKER_10]: But that was part of the definitive agreement that they would indeed have the license and have that be part of

601
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:31,524
[SPEAKER_10]: of Mass General Hospital's administration, with the Hallmark Health Administration being part of the management team that would take care of that hospital and keep it going.

602
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:34,965
[SPEAKER_08]: My apologies, Councilor.

603
00:57:35,165 --> 00:57:50,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Judge Saunders, in her written opinion, was very specific as it related to the cost containment not being able to be proven by partners, and also, I believe, the competition that the cost containment

604
00:57:50,786 --> 00:57:52,587
[SPEAKER_08]: could not prove that it would be able to do.

605
00:57:53,188 --> 00:58:05,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I think in the decision that was rendered by the Attorney General, the first one, Coakley, I believe there was a five or a six year gap in there or a window that they said that they wouldn't raise rates.

606
00:58:05,376 --> 00:58:10,580
[SPEAKER_10]: There were, yes, there was a five, actually five and eight and ten, there were different kinds of windows, yeah.

607
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:19,106
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think when Maura Healey, the new Attorney General, was looking for something that would be more of an establishment, that it would be well recognized and it could be amortized out.

608
00:58:19,146 --> 00:58:20,467
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that was one of the things that was

609
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:30,326
[SPEAKER_08]: That was deficient in the report that Martha Coakley, the original Attorney General, who rendered her opinion on that.

610
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,687
[SPEAKER_08]: But the licensure issue is the key.

611
00:58:32,747 --> 00:58:39,669
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate what you're saying, because I think I'm understanding that that could be a big advantage to us if we could get that straightened out.

612
00:58:39,689 --> 00:58:39,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

613
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:46,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think whatever your negotiations might be right now with partners, I think that should probably be premier right on the table.

614
00:58:47,432 --> 00:58:51,233
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd like to be a party of this, but we have to have an understanding.

615
00:58:52,088 --> 00:58:54,590
[SPEAKER_08]: that we have doctors that are well-respected in this community.

616
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,171
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we don't want them to leave.

617
00:58:56,191 --> 00:58:59,213
[SPEAKER_08]: We certainly don't want the citizens of Medford to leave the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

618
00:59:00,013 --> 00:59:02,955
[SPEAKER_08]: And for whatever and however, it's going to be left as an established hospital.

619
00:59:03,535 --> 00:59:09,639
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we don't have our license or our licensure, however you want to term it, in hand, then we have to wait.

620
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:11,741
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just going to prompt these people to leave.

621
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:14,222
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to prompt your nurses to say, hey, wait a minute.

622
00:59:14,582 --> 00:59:15,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Where am I going to go?

623
00:59:15,063 --> 00:59:15,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate what you're saying.

624
00:59:15,783 --> 00:59:18,525
[SPEAKER_10]: We would still have the license under that prior

625
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:23,416
[SPEAKER_10]: agreement, it wouldn't be that we would be unlicensed, it would still be very, very active.

626
00:59:24,117 --> 00:59:26,837
[SPEAKER_10]: But I hear what you say, and it's an interesting point.

627
00:59:27,718 --> 00:59:28,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

628
00:59:28,438 --> 00:59:28,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

629
00:59:29,258 --> 00:59:30,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

630
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:31,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Camuso.

631
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to speak after this paper, if we could take a few other items on the suspension.

632
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

633
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:43,422
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, all those in favor?

634
00:59:43,442 --> 00:59:44,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

635
00:59:45,877 --> 00:59:46,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passed.

636
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:49,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very, very much, Mr. President.

637
00:59:49,939 --> 00:59:55,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for moving towards resolution this neighborhood issue.

638
00:59:55,903 --> 00:59:58,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Did Mr. Capucci need to speak on this matter?

639
00:59:58,465 --> 00:59:59,205
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize.

640
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:02,827
[SPEAKER_09]: If you would, just state your name and address for the record.

641
01:00:03,247 --> 01:00:04,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

642
01:00:04,488 --> 01:00:06,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

643
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,732
[SPEAKER_09]: While I have this opportunity with President McDonald here,

644
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Through the chair, I just have a few questions.

645
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:21,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely don't want Medford to lose anything in a possible merger.

646
01:00:22,517 --> 01:00:27,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I strongly agree with the points Councilor Penta is bringing up.

647
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:35,764
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's another aspect to this that deeply concerns me as I work in the medical device industry.

648
01:00:36,325 --> 01:00:39,967
[SPEAKER_09]: As I'm sure thousands of more Medford residents do, Stoneham,

649
01:00:40,464 --> 01:00:43,126
[SPEAKER_09]: and this greater community does.

650
01:00:43,307 --> 01:01:04,125
[SPEAKER_09]: So with all due respect, through the chair, if I could ask President McDonald to perhaps speak on his, what's the word, on his professional opinion about these conversations he's having as to, he said there's no timeline or anything.

651
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:09,333
[SPEAKER_09]: that could be projected, but based on the conversations that he's having.

652
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:12,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Because a lot of jobs are in the balance.

653
01:01:13,577 --> 01:01:20,282
[SPEAKER_09]: From my industry, personally, I make laser scalpels, and our sales went through the floor.

654
01:01:20,703 --> 01:01:21,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of people got laid off.

655
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:23,585
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just my company.

656
01:01:24,206 --> 01:01:27,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Hologic up in Bedford, their market share went down 40% with the larger

657
01:01:32,385 --> 01:01:49,895
[SPEAKER_09]: doom hanging over us, for lack of a better term, of the Affordable Care Act, which caused a lot of insurance rates to go up, a lot of hospitals to make these mergers that are going on, not just in our community, but around the country, that are affecting a lot of people.

658
01:01:50,115 --> 01:01:55,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sorry, Mr. President, but this is a very huge issue.

659
01:01:56,419 --> 01:02:01,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try to be expedient, but please don't rush me out the podium, with all due respect.

660
01:02:01,967 --> 01:02:03,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of personal privilege, Councilor Knight.

661
01:02:05,108 --> 01:02:12,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. McDonald came here this evening to discuss an issue on Terrance Road, and I find it unfair to have him come down here and now discuss the issue of the hospital merger.

662
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:20,913
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that Mr. McDonald might want to have an opportunity to prepare himself to come down here and speak about this to maybe get some questions in advance to have answers to, Mr. President.

663
01:02:21,314 --> 01:02:31,537
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I certainly can understand the issue of uncertainty, and I think that nobody understands that better than Mr. McDonald, because he's very uncertain as to what's going to happen as well.

664
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:35,175
[SPEAKER_17]: And to put him on the spot right here this evening and ask him, what's going on with this?

665
01:02:35,215 --> 01:02:36,035
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you think about that?

666
01:02:36,075 --> 01:02:36,936
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you think about this?

667
01:02:36,996 --> 01:02:40,137
[SPEAKER_17]: When there's no plan finalized, it really puts him in a bad position.

668
01:02:40,397 --> 01:02:41,277
[SPEAKER_17]: He's going to say one thing.

669
01:02:41,297 --> 01:02:43,598
[SPEAKER_17]: He might come back three months later, and the situation's different.

670
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:45,739
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we're all going to say, you said this at this meeting.

671
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:51,020
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think we might want to give Mr. McDonald an opportunity to prepare himself to come down and speak about this.

672
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,201
[SPEAKER_17]: He's always been willing to come down to the council.

673
01:02:53,241 --> 01:02:55,522
[SPEAKER_17]: He's never been afraid to stand up at that podium and take questions.

674
01:02:55,967 --> 01:03:04,829
[SPEAKER_17]: for hours at a time, Mr. President, but I just think that, you know, we have to extend to him the courtesy to be willing to have an opportunity to prepare if, in fact, he is going to speak at length on this type of thing.

675
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:05,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

676
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of clarification, Councilor Lunkert-Kern.

677
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:10,691
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

678
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:16,112
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe Mr. McDonald is the one that began speaking about the possible merger situation.

679
01:03:16,132 --> 01:03:17,753
[SPEAKER_23]: At my behest.

680
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:19,753
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, correct.

681
01:03:21,114 --> 01:03:21,694
[SPEAKER_23]: And I believe he's

682
01:03:22,663 --> 01:03:26,705
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, able to say whether or not he's able to speak on something.

683
01:03:26,785 --> 01:03:28,466
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we have questions, we have questions.

684
01:03:28,766 --> 01:03:31,907
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I understand both sides, but... Thank you.

685
01:03:31,987 --> 01:03:36,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to allow Mr. Capucci to give us concise on-topic

686
01:03:36,997 --> 01:03:38,378
[SPEAKER_14]: questions and then briefly allow respect.

687
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:41,981
[SPEAKER_09]: With all due respect, I'm not asking any questions to put anybody on the spot.

688
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:43,543
[SPEAKER_09]: This council... We know that.

689
01:03:43,963 --> 01:03:45,264
[SPEAKER_09]: ...asked about the merger.

690
01:03:45,484 --> 01:04:06,121
[SPEAKER_09]: And since it did come up, as a citizen, representing thousands of people that work in the industry who are very concerned about this merger, I think it's prudent, I think it's sufficient, and I think it's precise... It has been established, so if you could... ...to ask, through the chair, President McDonald's professional opinion on whether or not he thinks this merger is going to happen.

691
01:04:06,474 --> 01:04:13,399
[SPEAKER_09]: and whether or not, based on the conversations he admitted having, whether or not, what kind of a timeline we're looking at.

692
01:04:13,699 --> 01:04:18,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Because a lot of people's livelihoods are in the balance.

693
01:04:18,923 --> 01:04:19,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

694
01:04:19,944 --> 01:04:21,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

695
01:04:21,645 --> 01:04:22,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

696
01:04:22,145 --> 01:04:23,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight, thank you very much.

697
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:29,811
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a good point that I would love to come back another time and even have a more detailed discussion.

698
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:31,392
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate that very much.

699
01:04:31,852 --> 01:04:35,235
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I can say is that it is a huge issue.

700
01:04:36,078 --> 01:04:38,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, and, uh, we would love to do it tomorrow.

701
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,881
[SPEAKER_10]: We would just love to do it right away.

702
01:04:40,941 --> 01:04:45,623
[SPEAKER_10]: We thought we started discussions with partners, healthcare, it was the summer of 2012.

703
01:04:46,504 --> 01:04:48,164
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll be three years this summer.

704
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:52,327
[SPEAKER_10]: And I honestly thought we would get there in 13, certainly in 14.

705
01:04:52,427 --> 01:04:59,150
[SPEAKER_10]: And we did not, uh, when the attorney general Coakley filed her consent agreement, it was April of 2014, 12 months ago.

706
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:04,553
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought we were there, but, uh, it didn't happen, but what's happening in the industry.

707
01:05:05,053 --> 01:05:13,135
[SPEAKER_10]: nationally is this consolidation, and it has got to do with the fact that there's less inpatient volume for hospitals.

708
01:05:13,195 --> 01:05:27,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we built hospitals up from the late 1920s up through the end of the century with a lot of subsidization and a lot of first-dollar insurance coverage, so people came to the hospitals more frequently when they needed to.

709
01:05:27,879 --> 01:05:29,219
[SPEAKER_10]: In a sense, they were more covered.

710
01:05:30,399 --> 01:05:32,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we have more consumer choice on deductibles and

711
01:05:33,465 --> 01:05:37,968
[SPEAKER_10]: co-pays, we don't have as much immediate use of the hospital facilities all the time.

712
01:05:38,008 --> 01:05:48,035
[SPEAKER_10]: And also technology has helped out so much that we don't come in for four or five days for appendicitis or hernia or those kinds of things, which once upon a time we did.

713
01:05:48,075 --> 01:05:51,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Now there's an afternoon procedure and you go home and get a call the next morning.

714
01:05:51,857 --> 01:06:00,243
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's changed dramatically what we built the hospitals for and it's become much less across the country, a hospital centric system.

715
01:06:00,617 --> 01:06:02,197
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a community-centric system.

716
01:06:02,237 --> 01:06:08,019
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about wellness in the community, reaching out and keeping people healthier and not having to come into the hospital as much.

717
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:12,140
[SPEAKER_10]: It's changed the way we make our investments for the future of healthcare.

718
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:23,764
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not just about the beds in a hospital as much as this electronic health records, recruiting physicians, setting up medical office buildings, having clinical diagnostic opportunities that are not overnight stay.

719
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:25,424
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it's changed a lot.

720
01:06:25,824 --> 01:06:28,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we see at Lawrence in the plan that we have

721
01:06:28,896 --> 01:06:35,278
[SPEAKER_10]: put forward is still continuing to have beds, but we have 134 beds licensed at Lawrence now.

722
01:06:35,318 --> 01:06:36,998
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't use 134 beds.

723
01:06:37,038 --> 01:06:38,558
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't for a long, long time.

724
01:06:39,138 --> 01:06:49,101
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd like to put in the definitive agreement, as you know, was to put 90 to $100 million into the Lawrence, but not for 134 beds because we don't use 134 beds.

725
01:06:49,161 --> 01:06:56,402
[SPEAKER_10]: If we put $100 million into 134 beds and we only use 40 or 50, we wouldn't be able to pay the 100 million back.

726
01:06:56,422 --> 01:06:58,543
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd be out of business and we would not have a Lawrence.

727
01:06:59,068 --> 01:07:12,176
[SPEAKER_10]: However, if we invest for what the patient base uses it for now, which is ambulatory, outpatient, clinical, diagnostic, short stay, we can always build up if things don't ever stay the same as we know.

728
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:18,160
[SPEAKER_10]: If you need more beds over time, you can always build up to have it if you're there and if you're part of the community.

729
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:21,642
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're not there, then you can't just start it overnight.

730
01:07:21,742 --> 01:07:22,903
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just too big of a job.

731
01:07:23,402 --> 01:07:28,465
[SPEAKER_10]: You see what's happened in other communities around us, Arlington, Woburn, Stoner, Malden.

732
01:07:28,985 --> 01:07:30,426
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we're not immune from that.

733
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:34,409
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying very hard to make it work, and we can see how to make it work.

734
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:41,593
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the investment to reach the patient base the way the patients want to use the hospital health care system now.

735
01:07:41,733 --> 01:07:43,895
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's different than 1970 and 80 and 90.

736
01:07:44,815 --> 01:07:45,396
[SPEAKER_10]: We see it.

737
01:07:45,476 --> 01:07:46,296
[SPEAKER_10]: We know how to do it.

738
01:07:47,117 --> 01:07:48,798
[SPEAKER_10]: We just need to get going with it.

739
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:50,519
[SPEAKER_10]: And we want to do it in 2015.

740
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:55,606
[SPEAKER_10]: and get it settled and move it forward.

741
01:07:55,626 --> 01:07:56,967
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're working very hard on that.

742
01:07:57,627 --> 01:08:02,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And we take great pride in what we have on that hill, and we want to make it even better.

743
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:03,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

744
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

745
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:05,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

746
01:08:05,851 --> 01:08:19,457
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, in the past, my take on this whole merger has been I'm looking at a trend in the medical field in greater Boston, which is unique in its has the best teaching hospitals around.

747
01:08:19,937 --> 01:08:20,918
[SPEAKER_07]: But the fact of the matter is,

748
01:08:21,422 --> 01:08:28,727
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a major trend from the 1990s to today that hospitals... When's the last time we saw a new hospital opening?

749
01:08:29,287 --> 01:08:32,149
[SPEAKER_07]: 1937, when Daniel Lawrence opened this up, or whatever the year was?

750
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Hospitals are tending to close now.

751
01:08:34,951 --> 01:08:36,632
[SPEAKER_07]: New England Memorial, right here in Stoneham.

752
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:40,174
[SPEAKER_07]: It was sitting as a vacant building up until recently, a few years ago.

753
01:08:40,414 --> 01:08:41,275
[SPEAKER_07]: The Malden Hospital.

754
01:08:41,675 --> 01:08:46,318
[SPEAKER_07]: The Whitten Hospital was on its last breath, and Cambridge Health Alliance came in and bought it.

755
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:49,260
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Boston Globe yesterday,

756
01:08:50,592 --> 01:08:58,638
[SPEAKER_07]: The Spaulding Hospital for Continuing Medical Care North Shore, 275 employees, 160 beds closing this September.

757
01:08:59,578 --> 01:09:00,179
[SPEAKER_07]: This September.

758
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that's going to become a vacant building up in Salem.

759
01:09:04,121 --> 01:09:08,965
[SPEAKER_07]: The last thing I want to see as a city councilor is a vacant building in the Lawrence Estates.

760
01:09:10,052 --> 01:09:11,273
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the last thing I want to see.

761
01:09:11,873 --> 01:09:26,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I am convinced, based upon statistical data that we've been watching in this greater Boston area, on the South Shore, on the North Shore, and throughout the nation, that without mergers of this nature, we're not going to have a hospital in a few years.

762
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:32,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Casey, we don't know what she may look out the window and see up in her neighborhood, quite honestly.

763
01:09:33,649 --> 01:09:34,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And that within itself is scary.

764
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:37,492
[SPEAKER_07]: It could change the whole character of an entire neighborhood.

765
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:44,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So as far as I'm concerned, I think that this is, I still think that this is definitely a step in the right direction.

766
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:47,894
[SPEAKER_07]: People are concerned as far as employees up there.

767
01:09:48,074 --> 01:09:50,335
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a major employer of the Medford community.

768
01:09:51,336 --> 01:10:04,563
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'd rather see people that are employed up there have an opportunity to go work for some entity on Lawrence Road that's a healthcare facility than get a pink slip, close its doors, and now they're collecting unemployment.

769
01:10:05,123 --> 01:10:06,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the way lesser of two evils.

770
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:18,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So for all those reasons, plus I think we're in good hands with the leadership at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital right now, I think it's the premier time to move forward.

771
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:23,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Because with all due respect to people out there that may be against this,

772
01:10:25,112 --> 01:10:29,876
[SPEAKER_07]: This might be the only thing that keeps that building alive, vibrant, and accessible.

773
01:10:30,136 --> 01:10:31,417
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's not forget about another thing.

774
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Urgent cares.

775
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:36,361
[SPEAKER_07]: 1984, you didn't even hear of urgent care.

776
01:10:36,381 --> 01:10:37,542
[SPEAKER_07]: 1995, you didn't even hear of urgent care.

777
01:10:38,102 --> 01:10:41,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Urgent care is servicing just as many patients a day, if not more.

778
01:10:42,225 --> 01:10:42,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I correct?

779
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:45,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the emergency rooms in this entire area.

780
01:10:46,448 --> 01:10:52,753
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't want to have to wait three hours to get a quick two stitches on their finger because they cut a piece of meatloaf or something at their house.

781
01:10:53,434 --> 01:10:54,555
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to go into urgent care.

782
01:10:54,935 --> 01:10:56,697
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in and out within 45 minutes an hour.

783
01:10:56,757 --> 01:10:58,278
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what most of them pride themselves on.

784
01:10:58,858 --> 01:11:02,882
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one right up here at the Lawrence Memorial site that's open up until I believe seven o'clock at night.

785
01:11:03,262 --> 01:11:03,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

786
01:11:04,463 --> 01:11:06,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Winchester Hospital is opening them up everywhere.

787
01:11:06,544 --> 01:11:08,726
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go to Wilmington and get into Winchester Urgent Care.

788
01:11:08,766 --> 01:11:09,167
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go

789
01:11:10,658 --> 01:11:12,899
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go, I believe it's Redding, there's another urgent care.

790
01:11:12,919 --> 01:11:15,159
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an urgent care in Redding as well as at LMH.

791
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

792
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,940
[SPEAKER_07]: So the trends are changing.

793
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And for us to sit here and not obviously look at the statistical data, I'm not saying that we're doing that.

794
01:11:22,642 --> 01:11:36,346
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think this is very unique because I think based upon the conversations that have been behind this rail over the past few years regarding this merger, as you said, since 2012, I think we're all cognizant of that fact for the Medford residents.

795
01:11:36,746 --> 01:11:40,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I've already heard from people over on Sampson Road and on the backside of the hospital

796
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:48,644
[SPEAKER_07]: where the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and the nursing home agreed to grow bushes recently and bring in bushes to protect some of the integrity of the neighborhood?

797
01:11:48,664 --> 01:11:53,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the original agreement.

798
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:54,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that.

799
01:11:54,609 --> 01:11:55,850
[SPEAKER_08]: On that issue with the bushes.

800
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:56,830
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an agreement.

801
01:11:57,211 --> 01:11:57,631
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

802
01:11:57,871 --> 01:12:02,515
[SPEAKER_08]: The unfortunate part about that, the folks at the nursing home cut the bushes down by mistake.

803
01:12:02,535 --> 01:12:03,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that.

804
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:04,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Or whatever.

805
01:12:04,777 --> 01:12:09,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was at the behest of the residents that forced the issue for which

806
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:12,049
[SPEAKER_08]: the hospital, the nursing home, had to put the bushes back.

807
01:12:12,509 --> 01:12:13,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So no fault of the residents.

808
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:15,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say that.

809
01:12:15,049 --> 01:12:17,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure why you would insinuate that.

810
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:19,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you indicated through a mutual agreement.

811
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:20,350
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no mutual agreement.

812
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:27,072
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a mutual agreement originally in the original plans with the city of Medford back when that nursing home was built, when you were on the Medford City Council.

813
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:27,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

814
01:12:28,192 --> 01:12:29,293
[SPEAKER_08]: But you just said now.

815
01:12:29,313 --> 01:12:30,533
[SPEAKER_08]: We made our point of clarification.

816
01:12:30,553 --> 01:12:31,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Council, we're on the same page here.

817
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:33,774
[SPEAKER_07]: We're on the same page here.

818
01:12:33,894 --> 01:12:35,554
[SPEAKER_07]: So like I said, that's it.

819
01:12:35,634 --> 01:12:37,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have to continue to endorse this plan.

820
01:12:37,755 --> 01:12:39,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the city council should go on record

821
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:46,259
[SPEAKER_07]: sending another letter to the new attorney general that the city council supports this merger with partners.

822
01:12:46,879 --> 01:13:05,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, at some point, if the attorney general will not allow that to go through, I would personally recommend the board and, um, in the powers to be to start pursuing other relationships with other hospitals that may be smaller, that the attorney general will allow to pass, because that's the only future I think we have here.

823
01:13:06,325 --> 01:13:10,446
[SPEAKER_07]: having a medical facility in the Lawrence Road area, so.

824
01:13:10,506 --> 01:13:12,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

825
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:13,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Council.

826
01:13:13,427 --> 01:13:21,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it was this council that made a request that have either Maura Healy or someone from her office attend a city council meeting to explain that position.

827
01:13:21,509 --> 01:13:24,769
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe also a request to have someone from the hospital to be here.

828
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:31,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to be that presumptuous to say to go ahead and support it because the new plan may not be advantageous to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

829
01:13:31,871 --> 01:13:34,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you notice in the, if you notice in the, in the,

830
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:41,777
[SPEAKER_07]: The paperwork that was filed by the judge, they didn't even talk about the North Shore.

831
01:13:42,197 --> 01:13:44,258
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all about the South Shore.

832
01:13:45,098 --> 01:14:04,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would say, given the relationship of the North Shore area with the folks in Boston, I would say they'd be more palatable to seeing this side of the merger go through.

833
01:14:05,978 --> 01:14:11,080
[SPEAKER_07]: As a community, I think we owe it to the workers, and as you stated, the nurses and everyone else up there, to support.

834
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:25,065
[SPEAKER_07]: If we really believe, like I do, and I'm not saying we all do, but if we really believe the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to be closed within a few years if a merger doesn't take place, then I think it's our job and duty to ask them to continue the negotiations and the discussions.

835
01:14:25,645 --> 01:14:27,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

836
01:14:28,286 --> 01:14:29,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilors.

837
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:30,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Motel.

838
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,948
[SPEAKER_10]: I could just with two points, Mr. President.

839
01:14:33,328 --> 01:14:48,619
[SPEAKER_10]: And the first one would be to thank this council so much for that vote at the end of 2013, which was seven to zero to support the work we're doing to strengthen Lawrence Memorial Hospital and a in a network with partners health care.

840
01:14:49,339 --> 01:14:56,624
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no question from our observation that the future for any community hospital is to be strong in a larger network.

841
01:14:57,164 --> 01:14:59,366
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're no different in Medford about that.

842
01:15:00,045 --> 01:15:10,029
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have a tremendous opportunity with the talent we have at Lawrence over time, still there now in the location that it is, the support of this great city.

843
01:15:10,949 --> 01:15:13,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, it's, it's really, uh, it's going to make a big difference.

844
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:23,855
[SPEAKER_10]: But the vote here at the end of 13 was a big factor in pushing us forward as much as we got, because it is about the community desiring to have a community hospital.

845
01:15:24,275 --> 01:15:25,855
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to say April 1st, 1924,

846
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:33,165
[SPEAKER_10]: is when we opened up 90th birthday, we had it last April, we had a little birthday party in the lobby, 90 years old.

847
01:15:33,466 --> 01:15:41,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. I would like to make a motion to send that same exact letter that we sent out to the authorities at the past.

848
01:15:41,553 --> 01:15:45,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it was to the attorney general as well as the other agencies that were involved in the merger.

849
01:15:46,118 --> 01:15:50,482
[SPEAKER_07]: The same letter to the new attorney general where the leadership has changed in the AG's office.

850
01:15:51,223 --> 01:15:52,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to have a roll call vote on that.

851
01:15:52,885 --> 01:15:57,627
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to send a letter to the AG in support of resolution of this matter.

852
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:04,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, it's the same letter we sent that we support the merger.

853
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:15,054
[SPEAKER_07]: It was supporting the merger in its, um, not in the specifics of it, but in the principles, the principles that were being spoke about.

854
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:16,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

855
01:16:16,094 --> 01:16:18,115
[SPEAKER_14]: So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

856
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:31,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and amendment, uh, request from Councilor Penta that the, uh, emotion also be amended to, to read that the, uh, Medford city council supports an immediate licensure approval for the Lawrence Memorial hospital.

857
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:32,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, how do we say it?

858
01:16:33,321 --> 01:16:43,790
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm trying to say rather than having it approved and you have five years to work within it, that the license is effective for the hospital immediately to become interactive with the, um, uh, partners.

859
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:45,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, what would the proper terminal?

860
01:16:45,332 --> 01:16:45,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that, uh, that,

861
01:16:47,880 --> 01:17:00,688
[SPEAKER_10]: The urging here is that the discussions for a merger go forward and that under one license and that the license be effective immediately upon an effective date of the merger.

862
01:17:01,489 --> 01:17:02,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

863
01:17:02,229 --> 01:17:06,692
[SPEAKER_14]: So on that good amendment by Councilor Penta, Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_14]: Suspension to take petitions, presentations on similar matters and communications from the mayor.

912
01:17:58,963 --> 01:18:06,445
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-309 petition by Wendy's restaurant, 330 Middlesex Ave to amend outdoor dining license.

913
01:18:06,985 --> 01:18:12,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Would the representatives of, uh, uh, Wendy's, uh, please make themselves present before the podium.

914
01:18:13,126 --> 01:18:15,007
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I believe it was, uh,

915
01:18:15,776 --> 01:18:24,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello, Chair of the Licensing Committee, presided over that portion of the subcommittee meeting.

916
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:26,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

917
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,921
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

918
01:18:28,021 --> 01:18:37,384
[SPEAKER_24]: Last week, we had a meeting in regard to Wendy's, and they had requested some changes be made to some of the things that we agreed to.

919
01:18:37,464 --> 01:18:44,147
[SPEAKER_24]: And if I can read them to you, I think last week when we voted on this, the gentleman who came up

920
01:18:45,493 --> 01:18:49,215
[SPEAKER_24]: had given us information that they were going to be closing at 8, and now we finally close at 10.

921
01:18:49,315 --> 01:18:54,439
[SPEAKER_24]: And there were some changes, but if I could read you what the changes, the modifications have been made.

922
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:59,462
[SPEAKER_24]: Patio hours of operation extended to 10 p.m.

923
01:18:59,802 --> 01:19:03,885
[SPEAKER_24]: to coincide with the hours of operation of the inside dining room.

924
01:19:04,825 --> 01:19:10,529
[SPEAKER_24]: The patio area shall be fenced and equipped with gates that will be locked when it is not in open use.

925
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:13,731
[SPEAKER_24]: In general, specifically after 10 p.m.

926
01:19:14,031 --> 01:19:15,292
[SPEAKER_24]: in lieu of installing the top.

927
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:18,467
[SPEAKER_24]: Umbrellas for tables will be taken in each night.

928
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:28,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Patio area will be lighted to meet or exceed the minimum state standards for access and egress with outside lighting where public is invited or accommodated.

929
01:19:29,054 --> 01:19:39,160
[SPEAKER_24]: Outdoor seating license will be reviewed in six months from the initial date of opening of the outdoor seating area to the public to ensure that there are no issues with the operation.

930
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,022
[SPEAKER_24]: We did meet on this and I think we're all in agreement, Mr. President.

931
01:19:43,873 --> 01:19:46,076
[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello.

932
01:19:46,357 --> 01:19:47,178
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favour?

933
01:19:53,186 --> 01:19:54,448
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm waiting for promptings.

934
01:20:16,902 --> 01:20:18,503
[SPEAKER_24]: These are what we agreed to last week at the meeting.

935
01:20:22,144 --> 01:20:24,365
[SPEAKER_08]: The chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

936
01:20:25,105 --> 01:20:26,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Number 2B, the lighting.

937
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:29,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you explain where is this lighting going to be?

938
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:32,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record, sir.

939
01:20:33,089 --> 01:20:34,129
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Chad Adams.

940
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:37,551
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm with Wendy's company.

941
01:20:37,851 --> 01:20:43,293
[SPEAKER_25]: My address is 240 General Warren Boulevard, Melbourne, Pennsylvania.

942
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:45,794
[SPEAKER_25]: The lighting will be coming from

943
01:20:46,416 --> 01:20:50,239
[SPEAKER_25]: predominantly the existing light fixtures that are on the site.

944
01:20:51,019 --> 01:20:53,921
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, we discussed, uh, briefly what the foot candles are.

945
01:20:53,961 --> 01:21:07,069
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a, it's an average foot 4.0 foot candles across the entire patio surface, which is well in excess of what the minimum standards are for outdoor seating and access ways, um, per state codes and requirements.

946
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:13,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Just on that issue right there, you're going to have that shooting off the building or are these going to be individual stanchions shooting down?

947
01:21:13,414 --> 01:21:13,914
[SPEAKER_25]: We have,

948
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:37,381
[SPEAKER_25]: Building lightings, recessed soft lightings that shine down and are completely shielded from view, illuminate the immediate area below the building surface and the existing parking lot lights that are out there right now, existing, that shine that level of light across where the patio area is going to be.

949
01:21:38,842 --> 01:21:42,424
[SPEAKER_08]: So through the chair, if you're saying that you're going to shut the lights off at X amount of time.

950
01:21:42,504 --> 01:21:42,804
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

951
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:44,525
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't say we're going to shut the lights off.

952
01:21:45,951 --> 01:21:50,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I thought the whole idea was to give you the... Go ahead.

953
01:21:51,732 --> 01:21:56,793
[SPEAKER_24]: What the gentleman said, even though the dining room closes at 10, they don't shut the lights in the dining room.

954
01:21:57,053 --> 01:21:58,874
[SPEAKER_24]: All the lights in the whole building will remain on.

955
01:21:59,394 --> 01:22:00,914
[SPEAKER_08]: That's inside the building, I'm talking about outside.

956
01:22:00,934 --> 01:22:01,374
[SPEAKER_24]: And outside.

957
01:22:01,934 --> 01:22:02,915
[SPEAKER_24]: No lights shut down.

958
01:22:02,955 --> 01:22:12,797
[SPEAKER_08]: So then how does that complete the purpose, as Councilor Marks alluded to in the beginning, of people just coming in there and wanting to hang around, because they're going to see the lights on outside.

959
01:22:12,817 --> 01:22:14,217
[SPEAKER_24]: There's going to be a gate, a locked gate.

960
01:22:15,614 --> 01:22:17,516
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a locked gate now, which we didn't have before.

961
01:22:19,498 --> 01:22:23,943
[SPEAKER_24]: They agreed to put a gate in there with a lock that will be locked when the dining room closes.

962
01:22:25,545 --> 01:22:27,166
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we were all in agreement of that last week also.

963
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:35,015
[SPEAKER_17]: For further clarification, Councilor Knight, I also believe that the gentleman

964
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:56,212
[SPEAKER_17]: represented the fact that they do have closed circuit surveillance cameras out there so that employees would not have to go outside if, in fact, someone was breaking the rules, jumped over the fence, that they wouldn't put themselves in danger, that they'd have an opportunity to call the law enforcement without actually having to go out there and confront individuals that may or may not be obeying the no trespassing signs or the no trespassing policy that they have in place after hours.

965
01:22:56,753 --> 01:22:59,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I happen to remember the police chief being present at that meeting last week.

966
01:23:00,996 --> 01:23:01,116
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

967
01:23:01,436 --> 01:23:02,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta, are you all set?

968
01:23:04,939 --> 01:23:05,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

969
01:23:07,862 --> 01:23:09,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

970
01:23:09,103 --> 01:23:10,044
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Deller.

971
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:18,090
[SPEAKER_23]: So with regards to the lighting then for an extra two hours, I know that there was issue with the units that are going to be built.

972
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:28,138
[SPEAKER_23]: Is there going to be some sort of way to direct the light so it's not in residential homes or apartments, condos, whatever is going to be built there?

973
01:23:28,398 --> 01:23:31,280
[SPEAKER_25]: The lighting right now, based on the existing

974
01:23:32,973 --> 01:23:37,676
[SPEAKER_25]: photometric plans, I believe is at half a foot candle at the property lines.

975
01:23:39,717 --> 01:23:43,660
[SPEAKER_25]: My engineer, Mr. Donato, could speak to that more directly.

976
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:52,525
[SPEAKER_25]: But the majority of the light is all contained within the boundaries of the property, as I believe is per code and ordinance.

977
01:23:55,127 --> 01:23:56,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Anthony Donato with Bowler Engineering.

978
01:23:56,407 --> 01:24:01,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted, Councilor Knight had asked for a copy of the lighting plan, which I had submitted last week.

979
01:24:03,023 --> 01:24:06,644
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it does show that there's no limited spillage at the property lines.

980
01:24:06,704 --> 01:24:10,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And the patio lights in the front, the development's in the back, correct?

981
01:24:10,605 --> 01:24:10,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

982
01:24:11,465 --> 01:24:12,625
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, there's no development there yet.

983
01:24:13,485 --> 01:24:13,646
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

984
01:24:13,726 --> 01:24:14,006
[SPEAKER_18]: Not yet.

985
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:18,447
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't know how the lights were shining in which direction from the plan.

986
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:30,129
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's all I'm asking to make sure, you know, when the units are built, that the light is directed so it's, you know, obviously not in somebody's home till 10 o'clock at night, now that we're talking the extra two hours, especially.

987
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:32,190
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, just to clarify.

988
01:24:33,219 --> 01:24:39,402
[SPEAKER_25]: there are no additional lighting being placed on the site specifically for the patio.

989
01:24:39,982 --> 01:25:01,311
[SPEAKER_25]: We have building lighting that that's, that's basically the lighting we have now on the building is sort of a wash that goes over the, the mansard, if you will, and spills down the lighting that we're going to replace that with is a recessed soffit light that's tucked up in the, in the soffit and shines directly.

990
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:03,290
[SPEAKER_25]: down onto the walkways.

991
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:13,052
[SPEAKER_25]: The remainder of the lighting is gonna come from existing site lights that are already been present, have been present for the past 10, 12 years, however long the restaurant's been open.

992
01:25:13,412 --> 01:25:15,392
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, that answers my question, thank you.

993
01:25:16,253 --> 01:25:16,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

994
01:25:18,533 --> 01:25:20,133
[SPEAKER_22]: The chair, Councilor Marks.

995
01:25:21,153 --> 01:25:29,195
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, I'm amendable to this compromise and I just wanna make sure that the six month review is still in place.

996
01:25:29,697 --> 01:25:30,818
[SPEAKER_24]: That is on the agreement.

997
01:25:30,938 --> 01:25:33,199
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to make sure that it's still part of the paper.

998
01:25:33,479 --> 01:25:39,123
[SPEAKER_14]: So that, that, that is clear that that was part of the agreement that came out of subcommittee, Mr. Chairman.

999
01:25:39,323 --> 01:25:39,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1000
01:25:40,124 --> 01:25:47,689

[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, at the original point of approval of both of these people, they presented themselves before the council and presented in packets that were recorded by the city clerk, their resumes indicating their suitability for these positions.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1024
01:27:57,381 --> 01:28:15,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give you a report since the last time I saw you, uh, the council, our commissioners, as you know, our major responsibility is to protect perpetual care, uh, for the cemetery and also to fiduciary responsibility for those funds that are pooled that have been given by various citizens for awards and requests.

1025
01:28:16,146 --> 01:28:18,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to report that over the past three years,

1026
01:28:18,868 --> 01:28:23,071
[SPEAKER_01]: We have changed our investment management system, our advisors.

1027
01:28:23,671 --> 01:28:35,438
[SPEAKER_01]: We have increased our allocation to protect us from the downside of the marketplace, but also to ensure that over time we're still delivering the amount of income needed, which we always request for $200,000.

1028
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:40,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Hill Advisors is our new investment advisor.

1029
01:28:40,141 --> 01:28:41,622
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a very good year.

1030
01:28:41,662 --> 01:28:43,063
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually done 8%, 18% since they came on board.

1031
01:28:45,230 --> 01:29:05,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And our bond portfolio, which is the major piece of what we need to derive our income, which we give away every year, not give away, we give back to you, the cemetery and perpetual care, has now a yield of about 3% with a duration of only three years, which is excellent given the fact that the interest rates are going to be going up, hopefully soon, and that our bond market won't be that affected negatively.

1032
01:29:05,794 --> 01:29:06,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.

1033
01:29:07,074 --> 01:29:08,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Tarani gives his apology.

1034
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,935
[SPEAKER_01]: He could not change his schedule tonight to be present.

1035
01:29:11,522 --> 01:29:12,883
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give this for the, uh, the, the clerk.

01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:28,792
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion of approval by Councilor Camuso, all those in favor.

1041
01:29:29,192 --> 01:29:29,512
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1042
01:29:29,613 --> 01:29:30,333
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed.

1043
01:29:30,353 --> 01:29:38,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations, Mrs. Beatrice, 15-three, three, seven to the honorable president and members of the Medford city council, city hall method, mass,

1044
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:52,160
[SPEAKER_14]: 02155, dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body confirm the reappointment of Mr. James Tarani of 248 Forest Street method as a commissioner of trust funds.

1045
01:29:52,601 --> 01:29:54,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Very truly yours, Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

1046
01:29:55,782 --> 01:30:00,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Tarani was unable to attend the meeting this evening.

1047
01:30:00,705 --> 01:30:07,029
[SPEAKER_14]: However, in the past he has presented himself before the council for his original appointment and has presented his resume

1048
01:30:07,576 --> 01:30:08,897
[SPEAKER_14]: as requested by the council.

1049
01:30:09,357 --> 01:30:13,821
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of approval by council, Camuso seconded by Councilor Marks.

1050
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:19,765
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, if I could, I know, uh, Mr. Tarami would like to appear before the council.

1051
01:30:20,406 --> 01:30:24,649
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would ask that this be tabled until Mr. Tarami could make it up to our meeting.

1052
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:36,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, we, we did, uh, at some point have a rule of this council that, uh, the vetting process include, uh, that, uh, members of these boards appear before the Medford city council.

1053
01:30:36,872 --> 01:30:41,716
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't make any stipulation, whether it was a reappointment or not, that they appear before the council.

1054
01:30:42,196 --> 01:30:48,542
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would ask that we stick to the rules that were adopted several years ago for the vetting process.

1055
01:30:49,182 --> 01:31:00,392
[SPEAKER_22]: And even if it's just allowing someone to come up and say a few words, as was just done, Mr. President, I think that suits not only this council, but members of this community as well.

1056
01:31:00,892 --> 01:31:03,494
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion to table, all those in favor.

1057
01:31:03,514 --> 01:31:03,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

1058
01:31:04,295 --> 01:31:04,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

1059
01:31:06,468 --> 01:31:08,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Please record me in opposition of the table.

1060
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:15,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was ready to move on this this evening, but, uh, that's council motion to table as well.

1061
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:17,231
[SPEAKER_16]: It's please record me in opposition as well.

1062
01:31:17,251 --> 01:31:18,231
[SPEAKER_16]: I spoke with Mr. Tarani.

1063
01:31:18,251 --> 01:31:19,771
[SPEAKER_16]: He answered my questions and concerns that I had.

1064
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:25,673
[SPEAKER_14]: So on motion of council maxi table roll call, roll talk call has been requested to table.

1065
01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:35,155
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, council max, just if I could, you know, I find it troubling, Mr. President, that, uh, you know, certain members of this council speak of,

1066
01:31:36,077 --> 01:31:40,200
[SPEAKER_22]: uh, any appointments that this council has to have a vetting process in place.

1067
01:31:40,981 --> 01:31:47,326
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, and then when we, uh, go to move towards a vetting process, uh, Councilors want to waive that process.

1068
01:31:48,147 --> 01:31:53,311
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, you know, so I, I just find it troubling and it, no one's against Mr. Trami.

1069
01:31:53,331 --> 01:32:01,217
[SPEAKER_22]: I know him very well, uh, Mr. President, and I've known him for a lot of years and I know he's a very capable person, but once we establish a process,

1070
01:32:02,265 --> 01:32:03,325
[SPEAKER_22]: We should stick by it.

1071
01:32:03,925 --> 01:32:15,328
[SPEAKER_22]: And the reason why we established that process years ago is because there were people just being reappointed without the council actually even ever knowing who these people are.

1072
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:22,730
[SPEAKER_22]: And secondly, knowing if the job is being done on behalf of the residents of this community.

1073
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:25,330
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that's why it was established at this time.

1074
01:32:26,071 --> 01:32:30,632
[SPEAKER_22]: We had one of our own, Councilor Penta, when his reappointment came to

1075
01:32:32,165 --> 01:32:43,389
[SPEAKER_22]: the Brooks Estates, it was questioned by a member of this council whether or not someone we serve with should be put back on the board and where the vetting process is.

1076
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:48,491
[SPEAKER_22]: And now we want to just allow people to come through without the process in place.

1077
01:32:48,531 --> 01:32:50,812
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm a little taken back by that.

1078
01:32:50,832 --> 01:32:55,354
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would hope that when we speak as a council,

1079
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:58,551
[SPEAKER_22]: We mean what we say, Mr. President, and not just do lip service.

1080
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:04,654
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Marks to table, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1081
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:06,115

[SPEAKER_14]: On the vote of five,

1096
01:33:22,422 --> 01:33:28,184
[SPEAKER_14]: In the affirmative to negative, motion to table is sustained.

1097
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:35,507
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to take a paper under suspension.

1098
01:33:37,587 --> 01:33:38,428
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1099
01:33:38,448 --> 01:33:40,528
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1100
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:42,789
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-338 offered by Councilor Knight.

1101
01:33:46,179 --> 01:34:08,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved the Medford City Council recommend Tufts University and its janitorial service provider DTZ reassess their current reorganization plan and in the process make every effort to ensure and maintain current staffing levels for the janitors assigned to the Medford-Somerville campus.

1102
01:34:08,216 --> 01:34:09,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1103
01:34:09,617 --> 01:34:11,038
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1104
01:34:11,759 --> 01:34:15,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a few weeks ago I had the opportunity to go to a forum at Tufts University.

1105
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:19,775
[SPEAKER_17]: It was put on by the Tufts Labor Coalition, Mr. President.

1106
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:27,580
[SPEAKER_17]: And at that forum, the topic of discussion was the Tufts University's reorganization plan for the janitorial service providers.

1107
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:39,427
[SPEAKER_17]: And as the forum went on, a presentation was made by the administration that would show that one-third of the janitorial staff would be eliminated based upon the reorganization plan, Mr. President.

1108
01:34:39,447 --> 01:34:42,509
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are 91 jobs or so up at Tufts University

1109
01:34:43,382 --> 01:34:50,667
[SPEAKER_17]: doing janitorial work, and the current reorganization plan will call for the elimination of 30 of those positions, Mr. President.

1110
01:34:51,988 --> 01:35:08,699
[SPEAKER_17]: As the forum went on, there was much discussion about the reason for the need for a reorganization, Mr. President, why the reorganization was necessary, and the reasoning that was given was that the reorganization was necessary only for the fact that they need to maintain sustainability.

1111
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, Tufts University, Mr. President,

1112
01:35:13,007 --> 01:35:16,708
[SPEAKER_17]: a university that charges $62,000 per year plus.

1113
01:35:17,648 --> 01:35:22,490
[SPEAKER_17]: They're the 24th most expensive college in the United States of America.

1114
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:28,312
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're undergoing a $49 million expansion project right now, Mr. President.

1115
01:35:28,332 --> 01:35:31,353
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't think sustainability is really an issue for Tufts University.

1116
01:35:32,833 --> 01:35:37,315
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the things that was presented at this forum was the fact they're going to cut staff so that they can bring in equipment.

1117
01:35:37,355 --> 01:35:38,315
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's all well and good.

1118
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:45,237
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think an investment in equipment and a divestment in the workforce is misguided and inappropriate, Mr. President.

1119
01:35:45,517 --> 01:35:54,382
[SPEAKER_17]: The 30 people that are going to lose their jobs eat at our sandwich shops, they go on Main Street, they buy goods, they spend their hard-earned dollars here in our community.

1120
01:35:54,923 --> 01:36:03,047
[SPEAKER_17]: That, coupled with the fact that they're some of the lowest-paid workers at Tufts University, leads me to believe that Tufts University's plan is misguided.

1121
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:05,689
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm asking my council colleagues here this evening

1122
01:36:06,025 --> 01:36:13,308
[SPEAKER_17]: to join me in supporting this resolution, which would ask Tufts University to maintain current staffing levels upon the reorganization plan.

1123
01:36:13,968 --> 01:36:26,434
[SPEAKER_17]: And looking at, you know, the workforce up there, Tufts University's in the process, in a construction phase of building their campus, but at the same time, they're going to cut one-third of the workforce, Mr. President, that's responsible for keeping it clean.

1124
01:36:26,754 --> 01:36:29,975
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a misguided policy, Mr. President, and it's going to cost people their jobs.

1125
01:36:30,355 --> 01:36:31,436
[SPEAKER_17]: These people make between $13.80 and $14.60 an hour.

1126
01:36:35,442 --> 01:36:46,326
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't think that, you know, Tufts University's historical approach and the founding principles of social justice are being taken into consideration at this point in time with this plan, Mr. President.

1127
01:36:46,646 --> 01:36:48,506
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd ask that my colleagues on the council support me.

1128
01:36:49,047 --> 01:36:53,148
[SPEAKER_17]: We have some of the affected individuals right here with us this evening who may or may not lose their job.

1129
01:36:53,188 --> 01:36:55,369
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't know right now because Tufts is keeping them in the dark.

1130
01:36:58,290 --> 01:37:02,691
[SPEAKER_17]: The best that they've been told is that any cuts to their job will be handled with sensitivity.

1131
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:04,892
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's where we are, Mr. President.

1132
01:37:05,301 --> 01:37:10,624
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm asking my colleagues to join me to support this resolution so that these people here in the front row don't lose their job, Mr. President.

1133
01:37:14,966 --> 01:37:15,687
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1134
01:37:15,707 --> 01:37:22,270
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, I hope that, you know, in this reorganization, that no Method residents lose their jobs.

1135
01:37:22,871 --> 01:37:30,775
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, Tufts is a large employer of Method residents, and maintaining the staffing level is important.

1136
01:37:30,815 --> 01:37:32,756
[SPEAKER_24]: And like I say, I would hate to see any Method residents

1137
01:37:33,627 --> 01:37:34,888
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll lose the job of this, Mr. President.

1138
01:37:35,048 --> 01:37:35,289
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1139
01:37:35,429 --> 01:37:41,594
[SPEAKER_17]: And we actually have a Metro resident here in the audience that would like to speak on the matter, Mr. President, if the council would be so kind to indulge.

1140
01:37:42,374 --> 01:37:47,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Please, if you would, please state your name and address for the record.

1141
01:37:48,099 --> 01:37:48,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

1142
01:37:48,519 --> 01:37:56,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Mirna Perez, and I live in 119 Grand Avenue in Medford.

1143
01:37:58,047 --> 01:38:01,930
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to interpret if that's okay with the council.

1144
01:38:02,823 --> 01:38:06,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Estoy aquí porque no quiero perder mi trabajo.

1145
01:38:06,626 --> 01:38:07,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Tengo miedo.

1146
01:38:07,827 --> 01:38:09,648
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here because I don't want to lose my job.

1147
01:38:10,028 --> 01:38:10,829
[SPEAKER_19]: I am scared.

1148
01:38:10,849 --> 01:38:13,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Y mis compañeros que están acá también.

1149
01:38:13,831 --> 01:38:15,693
[SPEAKER_19]: And my co-workers who are here with me as well.

1150
01:38:16,233 --> 01:38:19,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Trabajo en Tufts University como genitore.

1151
01:38:20,036 --> 01:38:22,478
[SPEAKER_19]: I work at Tufts University as a janitor.

1152
01:38:23,618 --> 01:38:27,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Y Tufts tiene planes de eliminar 35 trabajos en Tufts.

1153
01:38:29,392 --> 01:38:32,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Tufts has plans to eliminate 35 generic positions at Tufts.

1154
01:38:33,453 --> 01:38:36,975
[SPEAKER_00]: No es justo los recortes.

1155
01:38:37,615 --> 01:38:39,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Afectan a muchas familias.

1156
01:38:39,756 --> 01:38:43,417
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not just the cuts are going to affect many families.

1157
01:38:44,177 --> 01:38:49,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Y estoy aquí para pedir su apoyo, para ayudar a parar esos recortes.

1158
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:54,581
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're here to ask for your support to help us stop some of these cuts.

1159
01:38:55,201 --> 01:38:55,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1160
01:38:55,881 --> 01:38:56,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1161
01:38:58,535 --> 01:39:00,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Quienes estan viviendo in Medford?

1162
01:39:01,897 --> 01:39:02,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Algunos?

1163
01:39:03,358 --> 01:39:03,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Si?

1164
01:39:04,098 --> 01:39:06,399
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the person that came to speak on behalf of the president.

1165
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:07,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1166
01:39:08,961 --> 01:39:12,723
[SPEAKER_14]: So on motion of approval by Councilor Knight, uh, Councilor Penta.

1167
01:39:14,383 --> 01:39:26,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'm just a little bit perplexed on, on the motion to be honest with you, because we are now asking to get ourselves involved in a private institutions

1168
01:39:27,835 --> 01:39:29,155
[SPEAKER_08]: right to do whatever they want.

1169
01:39:29,275 --> 01:39:38,358
[SPEAKER_08]: And the social justice part of it, for which I understand, is very compelling, not knowing whether the jobs are going to be here or the jobs are not going to be there.

1170
01:39:39,178 --> 01:39:49,501
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've never seen the Medford City Council make the same argument for employees within this building, whether they're going to get laid off or not going to get laid off.

1171
01:39:50,141 --> 01:39:52,402
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is not within our purview.

1172
01:39:52,702 --> 01:39:57,143
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're looking for a vote that basically says it's not right, so be it.

1173
01:39:57,738 --> 01:40:02,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never seen Tufts University come down to this podium and tell us what to do and how to run our city.

1174
01:40:03,564 --> 01:40:04,505
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not their job.

1175
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:07,188
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not our job to be telling them what to do.

1176
01:40:07,448 --> 01:40:08,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we feel bad about it?

1177
01:40:08,729 --> 01:40:09,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure we do.

1178
01:40:10,351 --> 01:40:14,275
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think this belongs within the realm of the Medford City Council.

1179
01:40:14,695 --> 01:40:18,659
[SPEAKER_08]: If the council individually wants to take it upon themselves and write a letter,

1180
01:40:18,945 --> 01:40:27,668
[SPEAKER_08]: to the school and indicate to the school, to the new president, Barbara Rubell, the public relations lady, that we don't think this is right, so be it.

1181
01:40:28,529 --> 01:40:31,950
[SPEAKER_08]: But the fact of the matter is, they are a private institution.

1182
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:35,051
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't come under any control of this Medford City Council.

1183
01:40:36,032 --> 01:40:39,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And for us to go out of our way to try to say,

1184
01:40:39,907 --> 01:40:43,828
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I would hope that they would save whatever their jobs might be.

1185
01:40:44,628 --> 01:40:45,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So be it.

1186
01:40:45,108 --> 01:40:48,969
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't see them coming down here and telling us how to run our government.

1187
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:51,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Mrs. Beatrice just came up here.

1188
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:58,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see them coming down here and telling her how to invest those monies that she has a responsibility and the trust fund for.

1189
01:40:58,532 --> 01:41:00,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see that happening.

1190
01:41:01,933 --> 01:41:07,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think we're going into a territory that's, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it's never been charted before.

1191
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:09,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think that, you know,

1192
01:41:09,964 --> 01:41:16,288
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to serve any purpose, other than the fact of Tufts University, they get a resolution from the Medford City Council.

1193
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:17,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

1194
01:41:17,589 --> 01:41:18,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Somerville City Council?

1195
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:20,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing the same thing?

1196
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:20,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1197
01:41:20,370 --> 01:41:20,711
[SPEAKER_08]: April 9th.

1198
01:41:23,432 --> 01:41:28,575
[SPEAKER_08]: With that being said, Mr. President, I just don't think we're going in the right direction on this.

1199
01:41:28,756 --> 01:41:35,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I feel bad, and I don't know whether the jobs are going to be cut or not, I mean, if they're having such a large expansion,

1200
01:41:36,404 --> 01:41:44,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Common sense would tell me if they're going to be expanding more of their footprint, why would they be laying off rather than not hiring more to take care of the buildings of their new footprint?

1201
01:41:45,448 --> 01:41:45,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1202
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:51,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that being said, I just can't support this right now.

1203
01:41:52,131 --> 01:41:55,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we have everything in front of us that we really need for the facts.

1204
01:41:56,492 --> 01:41:59,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's emotional right now as it stands, and I can understand that.

1205
01:42:00,354 --> 01:42:04,976
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're spending all this kind of money for all this expansion, which is in the multi-millions of dollars,

1206
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:09,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, why should they even be considered to be losing their jobs?

1207
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:09,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1208
01:42:09,921 --> 01:42:20,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we should have somebody from Tufts University come down here and explain it to us, and then maybe the vote will have more of a substance rather than the emotion that it's going to have right now at the podium.

1209
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:21,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President?

1210
01:42:23,652 --> 01:42:24,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll say it, Councilor.

1211
01:42:24,493 --> 01:42:25,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Mr. President.

1212
01:42:25,074 --> 01:42:25,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1213
01:42:25,614 --> 01:42:26,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

1214
01:42:27,035 --> 01:42:30,198
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, I would like to go on record in support of this.

1215
01:42:30,218 --> 01:42:35,202
[SPEAKER_07]: These Medford residents that are employed through this, Medford taxpayers,

1216
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:36,810
[SPEAKER_07]: That's number one.

1217
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:45,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, and I don't mean to say this inflammatory, but the gentleman that just spoke brings up issues about the federal government after week.

1218
01:42:45,532 --> 01:42:48,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Common Core we talked about, which we have no jurisdiction over.

1219
01:42:48,272 --> 01:42:51,593
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about probably 27 times here at the Medford City Council.

1220
01:42:51,933 --> 01:42:54,233
[SPEAKER_07]: We've talked about oil coming from other countries.

1221
01:42:54,733 --> 01:42:58,234
[SPEAKER_07]: We've talked about many issues that we have no jurisdiction over.

1222
01:42:58,754 --> 01:43:02,334
[SPEAKER_07]: This is well within the right of any city councilor to bring forward.

1223
01:43:02,955 --> 01:43:05,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Just earlier, within the last hour,

1224
01:43:06,325 --> 01:43:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about the nurses that may be losing their jobs at Lawrence Memorial Hospital, and doctors.

1225
01:43:12,468 --> 01:43:19,030
[SPEAKER_07]: So to say that this is going on uncharted territory, as our fine city solicitor would say, that's fiction.

1226
01:43:20,631 --> 01:43:25,493
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do support you, Councilor Knight, and I support the working people that go to Tufts University every day.

1227
01:43:26,001 --> 01:43:27,982
[SPEAKER_07]: and they do a fine job, you know?

1228
01:43:28,903 --> 01:43:31,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Too many things around here are getting taken over by machines.

1229
01:43:31,725 --> 01:43:35,868
[SPEAKER_07]: You drive on the toll booths now, you drive through with your little fast pass, how many people lose their jobs?

1230
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:42,413
[SPEAKER_07]: You go to the touch bank now, you go to the ATM instead of using people that actually work the counter.

1231
01:43:43,414 --> 01:43:45,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Technology is good.

1232
01:43:46,670 --> 01:43:49,112
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the end of the day, you need people to do the jobs.

1233
01:43:50,213 --> 01:43:55,537
[SPEAKER_07]: So as far as I'm concerned, I support these working men and women that are here this evening, Mr. President.

1234
01:43:56,438 --> 01:44:05,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not know the language of their contract, but in principle, as we talked about earlier, in principle, I support them wholeheartedly, and I support Councilor Knight.

1235
01:44:06,105 --> 01:44:09,628
[SPEAKER_07]: But to talk that we're going down uncharted territories,

1236
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:20,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'd like to just take an hour to go back and look at the records of just this calendar year and see how many things we've talked about that have no jurisdiction of the Medford City Council.

1237
01:44:22,393 --> 01:44:24,694
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do support the council that brought this forward this evening.

1238
01:44:32,377 --> 01:44:33,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1239
01:44:33,538 --> 01:44:35,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

1240
01:44:37,059 --> 01:44:39,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I deeply respect the

1241
01:44:39,582 --> 01:44:45,044
[SPEAKER_09]: concern for jobs that Councilor Knight is bringing before the City Council.

1242
01:44:45,464 --> 01:45:00,169
[SPEAKER_09]: But with all due respect, when I got up and spoke earlier asking questions about jobs, the Councilor instituted a point of personal information or whatever to have the President come back and speak

1243
01:45:00,754 --> 01:45:02,275
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, when he's more prepared.

1244
01:45:02,715 --> 01:45:27,487
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would just request respectfully that, uh, before taking a vote on this, that Councilor Knight or another Councilor offer that the president or whomever the authoritative body is of Tufts university to come down and speak their side of it, uh, at a time when they're prepared as, as well, because the points are similar.

1245
01:45:27,667 --> 01:45:29,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trying to argue for jobs, like,

1246
01:45:29,988 --> 01:45:31,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Mr. Bynum.

1247
01:45:31,449 --> 01:45:33,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1248
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:38,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Tufts University's plan's not in flux, Tufts University's plan's not static.

1249
01:45:38,432 --> 01:45:39,132
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been defined.

1250
01:45:39,192 --> 01:45:39,993
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been established.

1251
01:45:40,173 --> 01:45:42,714
[SPEAKER_17]: They're telling us what they're doing, and they're looking to do it in May.

1252
01:45:43,234 --> 01:45:47,516
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, these changes usually happen at commencement when there are no students around, Mr. President.

1253
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,977
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a student-led effort.

1254
01:45:49,037 --> 01:45:55,460
[SPEAKER_17]: There are students in the Tufts Labour Coalition that have gotten together that have contacted me because they need support.

1255
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:56,661
[SPEAKER_17]: They need support.

1256
01:45:56,741 --> 01:45:59,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Students that live in Medford, that go to Tufts University, that go to that school,

1257
01:46:00,185 --> 01:46:08,828
[SPEAKER_17]: that is standing in support of these working people, of these working people who make between $13.60 and $14.80 an hour, Mr. President.

1258
01:46:09,428 --> 01:46:10,268
[SPEAKER_17]: They need their jobs.

1259
01:46:11,288 --> 01:46:12,689
[SPEAKER_17]: They need their jobs, Mr. President.

1260
01:46:13,009 --> 01:46:16,530
[SPEAKER_17]: This resolution will send a message to Tufts University that we support working men and women.

1261
01:46:16,917 --> 01:46:18,698
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what this resolution will do, Mr. President.

1262
01:46:19,098 --> 01:46:22,419
[SPEAKER_17]: So, well, the plan at the hospital, nobody knows what's going on.

1263
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:23,819
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. McDonald doesn't know what's going on.

1264
01:46:23,859 --> 01:46:25,199
[SPEAKER_17]: Mara Haley doesn't know what's going on.

1265
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:26,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody knows what's going on.

1266
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,000
[SPEAKER_17]: We right here know what's going on.

1267
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:30,661
[SPEAKER_17]: The administration has drawn their line in the sand, and they've said what they're going to do.

1268
01:46:30,981 --> 01:46:33,342
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not comparing apples to apples.

1269
01:46:33,362 --> 01:46:35,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, point of information.

1270
01:46:35,402 --> 01:46:36,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your point of information.

1271
01:46:36,763 --> 01:46:39,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1272
01:46:39,363 --> 01:46:44,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a point, and then just real quick, but the city of Somerville is

1273
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:57,699
[SPEAKER_07]: having the same type of resolution slash, not hearing, but the individuals as well as representatives from the city of Somerville, a meeting on April 9th on this very same matter.

1274
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that point of information, councillors.

1275
01:47:01,262 --> 01:47:02,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Sir, you may continue.

1276
01:47:02,463 --> 01:47:03,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1277
01:47:04,545 --> 01:47:14,833
[SPEAKER_09]: For the very reasons that council and I stated that we don't know was the reasons I came up here and asked a couple of questions since he was here, the president

1278
01:47:15,483 --> 01:47:23,467
[SPEAKER_09]: of Hallmark and suggested that we've had conversations was the very reason I asked a couple questions, because we don't know.

1279
01:47:23,867 --> 01:47:37,113
[SPEAKER_09]: All I'm asking here is for, with all due respect, a little less duplicity and ask for both sides to be heard from, like he was asking before when I asked a couple of small questions.

1280
01:47:37,173 --> 01:47:42,335
[SPEAKER_09]: And with all due respect in this election year, I think the job he's trying to defend is his own.

1281
01:47:42,355 --> 01:47:44,156
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a mischaracterization.

1282
01:47:44,772 --> 01:47:45,472
[SPEAKER_17]: of what I said.

1283
01:47:46,212 --> 01:47:47,933
[SPEAKER_17]: I wasn't trying to prevent him from asking questions.

1284
01:47:47,993 --> 01:47:51,453
[SPEAKER_17]: What I was trying to do was keep us focused on the resolution that was at hand, Mr. President.

1285
01:47:51,473 --> 01:47:55,474
[SPEAKER_17]: The resolution at hand was the issues at 72 Terrace Road and Mrs. Michelle Casey and the noise.

1286
01:47:55,874 --> 01:47:57,314
[SPEAKER_17]: The issue wasn't the hospital merger.

1287
01:47:58,174 --> 01:48:06,496
[SPEAKER_17]: That door was opened, but I felt as though it was inappropriate and unprofessional for Mr. McDonald to be put on the spot here when he wasn't here to talk about that.

1288
01:48:06,536 --> 01:48:11,897
[SPEAKER_17]: He came down here out of his goodwill and his own personal volition at the request of this council to address that issue.

1289
01:48:12,517 --> 01:48:13,337
[SPEAKER_17]: Miss Casey's house.

1290
01:48:13,743 --> 01:48:14,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing more, nothing less.

1291
01:48:15,224 --> 01:48:16,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor.

1292
01:48:16,264 --> 01:48:20,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, with all due respect- And I must take responsibility for those- Absolutely.

1293
01:48:20,226 --> 01:48:26,068
[SPEAKER_17]: Coupled with the fact that the gentleman sat in the audience with the man for an hour before he got up to talk on the microphone, and those questions could have been asked then as well.

1294
01:48:27,409 --> 01:48:32,090
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my fault for improperly administering that portion of the meeting.

1295
01:48:32,591 --> 01:48:33,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Sir, you may continue.

1296
01:48:33,671 --> 01:48:34,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1297
01:48:34,672 --> 01:48:38,073
[SPEAKER_09]: With all due respect, that gentleman sitting in the audience, I didn't know who he was.

1298
01:48:39,131 --> 01:48:40,672
[SPEAKER_17]: We're at the last seven meetings that he was here.

1299
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,372
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

1300
01:48:42,132 --> 01:48:42,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1301
01:48:42,692 --> 01:48:43,793
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not true.

1302
01:48:44,193 --> 01:48:48,414
[SPEAKER_09]: The last time, through the chair, Mr. President, that's not true what he said.

1303
01:48:49,235 --> 01:48:55,357
[SPEAKER_09]: The last time I was here for a meeting with the president of Hallmark Health, it was the CEO, Mr. Michael Sachs.

1304
01:48:55,757 --> 01:48:57,017
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't President McDonald.

1305
01:48:57,678 --> 01:49:01,639
[SPEAKER_09]: While President McDonald was speaking, I had to go ask his colleague what his name was.

1306
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:04,220
[SPEAKER_09]: With all due respect,

1307
01:49:05,273 --> 01:49:10,155
[SPEAKER_09]: This Council, through the Chair, asked a question about the merger.

1308
01:49:10,915 --> 01:49:12,275
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an open podium.

1309
01:49:12,736 --> 01:49:27,000
[SPEAKER_09]: When that was brought up for public discussion, I'm fully privileged, being a tax-paying citizen of this community, to come up and ask questions when this Council brings up the issue that the Council brought up, not me.

1310
01:49:27,461 --> 01:49:31,262
[SPEAKER_09]: So, with all due respect, Council, and through the Chair, you're wrong.

1311
01:49:31,962 --> 01:49:32,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1312
01:49:33,102 --> 01:49:34,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Mr. Cappucci.

1313
01:49:35,546 --> 01:49:36,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1314
01:49:37,047 --> 01:49:38,348
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1315
01:49:39,789 --> 01:49:43,092
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree with both Mr. Capucci and Councilor Knight.

1316
01:49:43,112 --> 01:49:45,734
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe that Mr. McDonald was here.

1317
01:49:46,074 --> 01:49:48,176
[SPEAKER_23]: We had the opportunity to ask some questions.

1318
01:49:48,216 --> 01:49:49,016
[SPEAKER_23]: You opened the door.

1319
01:49:49,437 --> 01:49:52,419
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe Mr. Capucci should have been able to ask some questions.

1320
01:49:52,739 --> 01:49:55,161
[SPEAKER_23]: But I also believe Councilor Knight has the right to bring this up.

1321
01:49:55,281 --> 01:50:00,765
[SPEAKER_23]: This is an issue that's affecting Medford residents who have jobs at Tufts University.

1322
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:04,641
[SPEAKER_23]: I harp on Tufts University a lot.

1323
01:50:04,921 --> 01:50:11,585
[SPEAKER_23]: Every council has brought up issues or wants Tufts University to do more, so I think it's well in the purview of what we can speak about.

1324
01:50:12,726 --> 01:50:22,912
[SPEAKER_23]: You have a lot of people here tonight, and you have 35 jobs that might be lost, and that's something that Councilor Knight and the rest of the council, we should speak out and ask Tufts University to rethink their plan.

1325
01:50:23,352 --> 01:50:31,176
[SPEAKER_23]: I definitely support this in principle, and I support maintaining the jobs that are currently the way they staff them now.

1326
01:50:32,567 --> 01:50:34,587
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree that both issues should be on the floor.

1327
01:50:34,627 --> 01:50:37,748
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe this is a good issue, and I'm glad it came before the council.

1328
01:50:37,768 --> 01:50:41,549
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm glad to educate the people of what's going on, and I support it.

1329
01:50:41,609 --> 01:50:43,049
[SPEAKER_23]: I second the resolve.

1330
01:50:43,989 --> 01:50:47,450
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion to second by Councilor Long-Term, Councilor Caraviello.

1331
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:48,450
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1332
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:50,750
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, this has gone to a whole new level here.

1333
01:50:50,790 --> 01:50:53,891
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, all these people are looking for just a little bit of support here.

1334
01:50:54,471 --> 01:50:58,732
[SPEAKER_24]: We supported Lawrence Memorial 10, 15 minutes ago about the jobs up there.

1335
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,612
[SPEAKER_24]: I think these people deserve the same respect

1336
01:51:01,153 --> 01:51:07,559
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, we're not forcing Tufts to keep them, but showing them that we are behind them, the same way we were behind the Lawrence Memorial Hospital also.

1337
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that, Councilor.

1338
01:51:09,701 --> 01:51:14,466
[SPEAKER_14]: And sir, you wish to address, please, if you would, state your name and address for the record.

1339
01:51:14,686 --> 01:51:16,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chris DeVito, 67 West Street.

1340
01:51:17,437 --> 01:51:22,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to add my voice in support of Councilman Knight's resolution.

1341
01:51:23,822 --> 01:51:41,315
[SPEAKER_05]: If you all remember back less than 20 years ago, late 90s, Tufts laid off a lot of janitors from its actual employment roles and then hired the company, I believe, that these people may work for, the second company following up.

1342
01:51:41,795 --> 01:51:44,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So they outsourced their janitorial staff.

1343
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:52,350
[SPEAKER_05]: following, uh, in second way and, and, uh, downsizing, uh, even more.

1344
01:51:52,630 --> 01:52:00,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can say this as a Tufts alum, because I'm getting bombarded with solicitations from the university to give money.

1345
01:52:01,152 --> 01:52:07,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm, I'm really disappointed in actually the, uh, the direction they've been going lately.

1346
01:52:07,313 --> 01:52:11,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I fully support this and, um, I hope it passes.

1347
01:52:11,974 --> 01:52:12,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1348
01:52:12,554 --> 01:52:12,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1349
01:52:13,114 --> 01:52:15,655
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion for approval by council and I'll call seconded.

1350
01:52:16,247 --> 01:52:17,908
[SPEAKER_14]: by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1351
01:52:18,048 --> 01:52:19,588
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion, Councilor Marks.

1352
01:52:20,389 --> 01:52:21,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1353
01:52:21,669 --> 01:52:25,491
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think anyone behind this reel wants to see anyone lose jobs.

1354
01:52:25,731 --> 01:52:28,652
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I don't think there's one person behind this reel.

1355
01:52:29,772 --> 01:52:37,615
[SPEAKER_22]: The question I do have, Mr. President, is I agree with the comments that were made that, at the very least, we're hearing one side of the story.

1356
01:52:38,015 --> 01:52:44,598
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be helpful to make an educated and informed decision to also hear from the administration.

1357
01:52:45,273 --> 01:52:50,516
[SPEAKER_22]: of Tufts University to hear what their reorganizational chart and plan calls for.

1358
01:52:51,016 --> 01:52:52,797
[SPEAKER_22]: I, as one member, think that would be helpful.

1359
01:52:53,237 --> 01:52:57,780
[SPEAKER_22]: I would also ask what exactly is the resolution we're voting on?

1360
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,961
[SPEAKER_22]: The language itself, is it exactly how it reads?

1361
01:53:04,643 --> 01:53:07,285
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're voting on that exact language, okay?

1362
01:53:07,845 --> 01:53:13,228
[SPEAKER_22]: And Mr. President, I would also state that, you know, we're talking about staffing levels

1363
01:53:14,169 --> 01:53:23,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Tufts University has every right to take a look at their staffing levels and make determinations whether they believe they have too much staff, not enough staff, whatever needs to be done.

1364
01:53:24,156 --> 01:53:26,597
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would say the same applies to the city of Medford.

1365
01:53:27,638 --> 01:53:31,740
[SPEAKER_22]: If you look at our staffing level in our police department, we're at an all-time low.

1366
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:35,103
[SPEAKER_22]: If you look at the fire department, we're at an all-time low.

1367
01:53:35,623 --> 01:53:39,305
[SPEAKER_22]: The DPW, we're at an all-time low right now in staffing right now.

1368
01:53:39,946 --> 01:53:43,368
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think when we talk about staffing levels,

1369
01:53:43,822 --> 01:53:45,237
[SPEAKER_22]: and want to put...

1370
01:53:46,693 --> 01:53:59,901
[SPEAKER_22]: the onus on a particular private entity and say, we think you should leave your staffing levels at this, then I think we also have to look in-house and say, why are our staffing levels so very low?

1371
01:54:00,641 --> 01:54:05,704
[SPEAKER_22]: Why are we outsourcing work that could be done by our DPW?

1372
01:54:06,264 --> 01:54:11,567
[SPEAKER_22]: Why are we outsourcing parking enforcement that could be done by our police department?

1373
01:54:12,088 --> 01:54:13,529
[SPEAKER_22]: Why are we outsourcing?

1374
01:54:13,929 --> 01:54:15,850
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would like to have that discussion

1375
01:54:16,813 --> 01:54:22,575
[SPEAKER_22]: sometime, too, Mr. President, because it's nice to look outside of what's happening in your own community.

1376
01:54:22,995 --> 01:54:38,699
[SPEAKER_22]: But if you take a look in your community and see what's going on with low staffing levels, outsourcing, I think, you know, that, in my opinion, deserves a much better look than currently is being discussed at this particular point.

1377
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:39,820
[SPEAKER_22]: And I am

1378
01:54:41,064 --> 01:54:44,665
[SPEAKER_22]: supportive, I will vote to support the workers.

1379
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:50,547
[SPEAKER_22]: However, I think we do need, Mr. President, Barbara Rubell or someone from Tufts University.

1380
01:54:50,927 --> 01:55:02,011
[SPEAKER_22]: Barbara comes up here quite often and is very familiar with this council, to at least give us something, whether she wants to appear before us or in writing, what their organizational plan is.

1381
01:55:02,811 --> 01:55:06,072
[SPEAKER_22]: I, as one member, would find that very helpful, Mr. President.

1382
01:55:06,803 --> 01:55:27,932
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would look forward to future meetings with the same vigor on our own staffing levels and maybe to hold the mayor accountable, maybe members of this council that support the mayor step by step by step to also hold the mayor accountable for our low levels of manning and police, fire, and DPW.

1383
01:55:28,192 --> 01:55:31,033
[SPEAKER_22]: And not look at an institution and say, why are you doing this?

1384
01:55:31,453 --> 01:55:36,015
[SPEAKER_22]: Look at the mayor and say, Mr. Mayor, why are you doing this to our community, Mr. Mayor, leaving us

1385
01:55:36,357 --> 01:55:40,699
[SPEAKER_22]: at dangerously low levels of fire and police protection in our community.

1386
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:44,140
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I would like to see a little emphasis on that also, Mr. President.

1387
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:46,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1388
01:55:46,841 --> 01:55:54,243
[SPEAKER_14]: So, on the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended by Vice President Second and by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, Councilor Penta.

1389
01:55:54,263 --> 01:55:59,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I'm looking at the recommendation, and I will admit that it does have merit.

1390
01:55:59,725 --> 01:56:01,746
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a word in here that I didn't realize was in here.

1391
01:56:02,246 --> 01:56:02,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I was reading it.

1392
01:56:03,047 --> 01:56:04,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I read it wrong.

1393
01:56:05,192 --> 01:56:12,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no problem saying that Medford City Council respectfully recommends, because I think that has a different tone to it, okay?

1394
01:56:12,794 --> 01:56:16,815
[SPEAKER_08]: And the word reassess is not telling them exactly to do it, but I think it's implied.

1395
01:56:17,275 --> 01:56:32,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, and I agree with Councilor Marks, you know, I think this is, it's a good resolution, because again, like I said, I don't think we're out to hurt anybody, but the fact of the matter is, you know, we have to look at our own building, what goes on in this entire building here between and amongst ourselves.

1396
01:56:33,448 --> 01:56:38,310
[SPEAKER_08]: We have positions that are understaffed and we have positions maybe that are overstaffed, I don't know.

1397
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:45,573
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as that goes, I would like to, after the word Medford City Council, put the word respectfully recommends.

1398
01:56:46,813 --> 01:56:49,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Because usually that's what a Medford City Council resolution does.

1399
01:56:49,334 --> 01:56:50,995
[SPEAKER_08]: They respectfully recommend.

1400
01:56:51,375 --> 01:56:53,816
[SPEAKER_14]: As the councilor who offered the motion.

1401
01:56:54,677 --> 01:56:57,898
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're gonna add the word respectfully to recommend.

1402
01:56:58,925 --> 01:56:59,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, thank you.

1403
01:56:59,585 --> 01:57:00,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta.

1404
01:57:00,506 --> 01:57:00,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1405
01:57:01,166 --> 01:57:12,112
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion for approval by vice president, uh, for by Adam, uh, Councilor Knight as seconded by vice president Lego current roll call has been requested.

1406
01:57:12,192 --> 01:57:12,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor mocks.

1407
01:57:13,272 --> 01:57:27,059
[SPEAKER_22]: We could just add a B paper that we get a response back from either Barbara Bell or the Tufts administration on, uh, their organizational plan and also get some feedback from Tufts university itself.

1408
01:57:27,459 --> 01:57:28,520
[SPEAKER_22]: I have nothing in front of me.

1409
01:57:28,897 --> 01:57:32,698
[SPEAKER_22]: other than the great comment that was made by Councilor Knight.

1410
01:57:33,038 --> 01:57:38,399
[SPEAKER_22]: But I have nothing in front of me from Tufts University explaining what their reorganizational plan is.

1411
01:57:38,799 --> 01:57:41,180
[SPEAKER_22]: And does it stop with the janitorials?

1412
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:46,501
[SPEAKER_22]: Or does it add to police, fire, and anything else that's on the campus?

1413
01:57:47,521 --> 01:57:49,021
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what the impact is.

1414
01:57:49,081 --> 01:57:54,743
[SPEAKER_22]: This may be just one portion of an overall larger organizational picture that I'm not privy to.

1415
01:57:55,763 --> 01:57:56,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1416
01:57:56,612 --> 01:58:15,402
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, on that main motion with the roll call, and we're also going to add a B paper, which will be voted on simultaneously, uh, by Councilor Marks to send a communique in addition, uh, to the administration via Barbara Rubel's office, uh, to inform the council.

1417
01:58:15,782 --> 01:58:19,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if I'm items enumerated, I believe Ms.

1418
01:58:19,124 --> 01:58:22,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Rubel's office would be the inappropriate, uh, place to send that.

1419
01:58:22,125 --> 01:58:24,887
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it might have to go to the vice president of administration.

1420
01:58:25,330 --> 01:58:31,673
[SPEAKER_17]: So then we'll do that to the vice president of administration.

1421
01:58:31,873 --> 01:58:36,816
[SPEAKER_22]: I think where Barbara is the community relations person, I think she should be CC.

1422
01:58:37,096 --> 01:58:37,777
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll copy.

1423
01:58:37,837 --> 01:58:41,418
[SPEAKER_22]: She's been the only face of Tufts university with this council.

1424
01:58:41,559 --> 01:58:44,180
[SPEAKER_22]: She is for many years on that motion.

1425
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:49,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, call the roll council.

1426
01:58:49,663 --> 01:58:50,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1427
01:58:50,763 --> 01:58:51,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1428
01:58:51,544 --> 01:58:51,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1429
01:58:52,344 --> 01:58:52,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice president.

1430
01:58:52,865 --> 01:58:53,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Lowell Kern.

1431
01:58:53,405 --> 01:58:53,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1432
01:58:54,092 --> 01:58:54,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1433
01:58:54,832 --> 01:58:55,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1434
01:58:55,413 --> 01:58:55,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

1435
01:58:55,953 --> 01:58:56,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1436
01:58:57,334 --> 01:58:58,114
[SPEAKER_11]: President Dello Russo.

1437
01:58:58,194 --> 01:58:58,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1438
01:58:58,774 --> 01:59:01,816
[SPEAKER_14]: And the vote is seven in affirmative, none in the negative.

1439
01:59:02,216 --> 01:59:06,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1440
01:59:06,178 --> 01:59:12,001
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn to revert back to the regular order of business.

1441
01:59:12,121 --> 01:59:12,962
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor.

1442
01:59:13,482 --> 01:59:14,442
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed.

1443
01:59:15,663 --> 01:59:17,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Regular order of business.

1444
01:59:17,866 --> 01:59:21,107
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-330 offered by Councilor Penta.

1445
01:59:21,647 --> 01:59:28,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that a special birthday wish be forwarded to Alfred Valenti on his upcoming 93rd birthday.

1446
01:59:29,008 --> 01:59:44,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Valenti is well known for his Valenti Ticket Agency on Valenti Way, North Station, Boston, where so many folks bought tickets for years and got excellent service in their ticket requests for sporting and family events.

1447
01:59:44,971 --> 01:59:47,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta, for this great Medford citizen.

1448
01:59:47,465 --> 02:00:03,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, it's another wonderful Medford business person who, through the years, has helped so many individuals in this community make sure they got their tickets to enjoy sporting and community and family events, whether they be at the Boston Garden or other locations.

1449
02:00:03,978 --> 02:00:08,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just think it would be a nice way to say hello, give them a recommendation, and a happy birthday.

1450
02:00:09,122 --> 02:00:10,303
[SPEAKER_08]: The President Great guy.

1451
02:00:10,323 --> 02:00:11,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for that.

1452
02:00:11,943 --> 02:00:15,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion on the motion of approval by Councilor Penta, Councilor Caraviello.

1453
02:00:15,965 --> 02:00:16,685
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1454
02:00:16,705 --> 02:00:18,786
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a good thing by Councilor Penta.

1455
02:00:18,886 --> 02:00:20,026
[SPEAKER_24]: I know Mr. Valente also.

1456
02:00:23,748 --> 02:00:26,389
[SPEAKER_24]: He helped start our Kiwanis fight night some 30 years ago.

1457
02:00:27,129 --> 02:00:29,370
[SPEAKER_24]: And this year is our 30th anniversary.

1458
02:00:29,390 --> 02:00:33,692
[SPEAKER_24]: It's something that this gentleman helped started and I'm sure he's going to be there in a couple of weeks.

1459
02:00:34,332 --> 02:00:36,153
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, he's a good guy.

1460
02:00:37,123 --> 02:00:37,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1461
02:00:37,543 --> 02:00:40,565
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion approved by Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

1462
02:00:40,805 --> 02:00:40,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1463
02:00:41,166 --> 02:00:43,147
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1464
02:00:43,627 --> 02:00:45,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion carries.

1465
02:00:45,308 --> 02:00:47,290
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-332 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1466
02:00:48,270 --> 02:00:57,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools provide to the Medford City Council what drug prevention and education programs they are offering Medford students and teachers.

1467
02:00:59,390 --> 02:01:05,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that the Medford Public Schools begin providing additional drug prevention-based programs for our students.

1468
02:01:06,031 --> 02:01:15,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that the Medford Public Schools begin educating our staff and teachers with regards to prevention, warning signs, and effects.

1469
02:01:15,913 --> 02:01:16,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Vice President.

1470
02:01:17,794 --> 02:01:19,314
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1471
02:01:19,674 --> 02:01:25,295
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, we speak about an important issue in this community, a crisis that is going on.

1472
02:01:26,692 --> 02:01:48,587
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not really sure where to begin, you know, speaking on this specific topic, but I'll say that three weeks ago, the city council met, and we met with Team Medford, the police, members of the police department, members of the fire department, members of Armstrong Ambulance, parents of, you know, who have children that are addicted.

1473
02:01:48,607 --> 02:01:55,231
[SPEAKER_23]: There was representatives from the school department, and in that two-hour meeting, we discussed

1474
02:01:55,822 --> 02:02:22,396
[SPEAKER_23]: a whole host of problems, a whole host of ways to, things that need to be resolved, some having to do with prevention, treatment, what families go through, what, you know, those addicted go through, lack of treatment facilities, the problem with regards to the doctors prescribing, probably inappropriately or, you know, too much, and one

1475
02:02:24,668 --> 02:02:30,811
[SPEAKER_23]: We can have a meeting probably on each separate topic with different department heads and representatives.

1476
02:02:31,291 --> 02:02:43,876
[SPEAKER_23]: But one thing I would like to move forward with and something that I would like to, you know, hopefully we can have a city council committee, the whole meeting very shortly with the school department, representatives from the school department.

1477
02:02:44,356 --> 02:02:48,458
[SPEAKER_23]: We could, I would like to meet with the Medford city council and have team Medford there as well.

1478
02:02:49,698 --> 02:02:53,500
[SPEAKER_23]: I would like to discuss and implement more

1479
02:02:53,933 --> 02:02:55,774
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry, you guys are throwing me off.

1480
02:02:55,994 --> 02:02:56,974
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it's okay, I'll wait.

1481
02:02:57,634 --> 02:02:58,495
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, you're all set, okay.

1482
02:03:04,177 --> 02:03:06,058
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we need more prevention in our schools.

1483
02:03:06,638 --> 02:03:19,083
[SPEAKER_23]: We heard representatives from the school department talk about the DARE program, which I've been an advocate for for many, many years, but they mentioned that we have the DARE program for a limited basis in our fifth grade.

1484
02:03:20,084 --> 02:03:23,765
[SPEAKER_23]: They mentioned a few other things that are done, and to me, it's just not enough.

1485
02:03:24,405 --> 02:03:32,010
[SPEAKER_23]: We are facing death after death, losing friends and people losing family members.

1486
02:03:33,231 --> 02:03:39,015
[SPEAKER_23]: Within the last week or so, I've lost a personal friend of mine, 34 years old.

1487
02:03:39,055 --> 02:03:40,996
[SPEAKER_23]: He passed away on March 27th.

1488
02:03:42,898 --> 02:03:51,443
[SPEAKER_23]: Over the weekend, from what I hear, another Medford resident, to me, I know I sound old, but a baby, a 23-year-old, died on Easter morning.

1489
02:03:52,864 --> 02:03:53,905
[SPEAKER_23]: We need to make sure

1490
02:03:54,987 --> 02:04:09,714
[SPEAKER_23]: that we do whatever we can so that our children will not take the first steps that so many have taken, which we've heard at the vigil, it takes one time to shoot up heroin and you become addicted.

1491
02:04:10,514 --> 02:04:20,379
[SPEAKER_23]: How do we prevent our younger generation, which I know is only one part of the puzzle, one part of the problem, but obviously to me, who have children in the schools,

1492
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:28,454
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. Councilor Knight, Councilor Camuso, you're going to have grandchildren in the schools very soon, Councilor Penta, Councilor Marks, Councilor Caraviello has grandchildren.

1493
02:04:29,014 --> 02:04:30,955
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Dello Russo, I know you care about the topic, too.

1494
02:04:30,975 --> 02:04:34,277
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sure if you have nieces and, you know, school-age nieces.

1495
02:04:35,497 --> 02:04:38,359
[SPEAKER_23]: But having the day program, it's just not enough.

1496
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:49,885
[SPEAKER_23]: I did probably two hours of research, very minimal research over the last week and a half with regards to you can go on Google, and there are programs.

1497
02:04:50,913 --> 02:04:56,915
[SPEAKER_23]: free pamphlets and booklets and CDs, ways to educate our youth.

1498
02:04:58,336 --> 02:05:00,116
[SPEAKER_23]: We have the life skills training.

1499
02:05:00,156 --> 02:05:03,198
[SPEAKER_23]: There's online courses our teachers can take for prevention.

1500
02:05:03,738 --> 02:05:20,184
[SPEAKER_23]: There are free pamphlets with regards of how to educate grades three through six, how to educate our high school students, how to create youth and adults, give them facts about drugs so that they can make better informed decisions.

1501
02:05:20,843 --> 02:05:22,344
[SPEAKER_23]: and live a drug-free life.

1502
02:05:22,784 --> 02:05:23,885
[SPEAKER_23]: We need this.

1503
02:05:24,465 --> 02:05:28,767
[SPEAKER_23]: I spoke to one school committee member so far, and I plan on reaching out to the rest.

1504
02:05:29,627 --> 02:05:32,889
[SPEAKER_23]: But I think this is one thing that we've all come together on.

1505
02:05:32,949 --> 02:05:34,190
[SPEAKER_23]: We need to work together.

1506
02:05:35,210 --> 02:05:42,554
[SPEAKER_23]: That would be one of the next meetings I would ask, whether we do it in a subcommittee or a Committee of the Whole meeting, that would be one of the next meetings we have.

1507
02:05:43,334 --> 02:05:49,057
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think it's ever too early to start teaching your kids and the students about drugs and drug prevention and signs

1508
02:05:49,741 --> 02:05:50,982
[SPEAKER_23]: Teachers need to know.

1509
02:05:51,042 --> 02:05:53,843
[SPEAKER_23]: They need to know how to handle students, how to teach students.

1510
02:05:54,563 --> 02:06:02,726
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think we can collaboratively come up with ideas and come up with ways to prevent, you know, something that has become such an issue.

1511
02:06:04,567 --> 02:06:12,790
[SPEAKER_23]: My daughter, you know, when my friend passed on the 27th, you know, came into the room, and it's really sad when your six-and-a-half-year-old says, Mama, you know, what's wrong?

1512
02:06:13,130 --> 02:06:13,610
[SPEAKER_23]: Who died?

1513
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:15,631
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what it's becoming.

1514
02:06:16,411 --> 02:06:18,552
[SPEAKER_23]: My six-and-a-half-year-old daughter asked me who died.

1515
02:06:18,632 --> 02:06:18,912
[SPEAKER_23]: She knew.

1516
02:06:20,253 --> 02:06:21,813
[SPEAKER_23]: And I had to tell her that I lost a friend.

1517
02:06:22,833 --> 02:06:36,916
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's one of many, I'm sure we all know people and all know, you know, young and old, we've said it before, it hits people in their teens, 20s, you know, we're losing people 50s and 60s to this epidemic.

1518
02:06:38,956 --> 02:06:41,177
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, I know we're all very passionate about it.

1519
02:06:41,237 --> 02:06:47,798
[SPEAKER_23]: We had an amazing meeting, two hour long meeting, round tabled, you know, the 10 issues that go along with it.

1520
02:06:48,145 --> 02:06:50,365
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is one of those pieces that we need to work on.

1521
02:06:50,545 --> 02:06:58,047
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would ask my colleagues that we sit down and we figure out ways to educate our students and ways to educate our teachers.

1522
02:06:58,727 --> 02:07:05,608
[SPEAKER_23]: I also reached out to a few teachers that I know, and I asked, what type of prevention, what type of training?

1523
02:07:05,628 --> 02:07:07,308
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you have a one-hour training?

1524
02:07:07,328 --> 02:07:12,249
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you have a full-day training on drug prevention, alcohol prevention?

1525
02:07:12,669 --> 02:07:13,009
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, no.

1526
02:07:13,029 --> 02:07:16,470
[SPEAKER_23]: The teachers I spoke to, I have no idea.

1527
02:07:16,490 --> 02:07:17,270
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll ask around.

1528
02:07:18,581 --> 02:07:19,962
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously, that's not enough.

1529
02:07:20,142 --> 02:07:24,563
[SPEAKER_23]: Teachers shouldn't have to ask around of whether or not we have any training in our schools.

1530
02:07:26,424 --> 02:07:37,527
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm going to let any of my other colleagues who would like to speak on this, but there are programs, there are free programming tools out there that we need to take advantage of.

1531
02:07:37,567 --> 02:07:40,188
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm sure there's grants that we can also take advantage of.

1532
02:07:40,568 --> 02:07:42,049
[SPEAKER_23]: That's my next research project.

1533
02:07:42,629 --> 02:07:46,030
[SPEAKER_23]: But I'd like to come together within the next few weeks and work on this.

1534
02:07:47,207 --> 02:07:48,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1535
02:07:48,928 --> 02:08:08,098
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to update the council, until we get the draft ordinance finalized for our consideration, at that point, then I'll reschedule the next meeting of the Committee of the Whole regarding the issue that you bring up, Madam Vice President.

1536
02:08:08,559 --> 02:08:14,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that there's a draft circulating City Hall, and I think there's just a couple key department heads sort of giving input.

1537
02:08:15,474 --> 02:08:22,798
[SPEAKER_14]: and tweaking it before something's presented to the council for our consideration and input as well.

1538
02:08:23,278 --> 02:08:24,458
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'll do that.

1539
02:08:24,879 --> 02:08:32,402
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have the opportunity to focus on that and committee of the whole and see what else comes our way with all those interested parties.

1540
02:08:32,902 --> 02:08:38,585
[SPEAKER_23]: If we could have the representatives from the school department that were here actually put in writing, you know, what prevention there is.

1541
02:08:38,625 --> 02:08:43,247
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I was taking notes, but I know we have fifth grade deer and I know they mentioned one other thing.

1542
02:08:43,702 --> 02:08:50,904
[SPEAKER_23]: But if they could put that in writing, what is provided to our schools, our teachers, and our students, so that we can, you know, improve on that, that would be helpful.

1543
02:08:51,484 --> 02:08:51,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1544
02:08:52,725 --> 02:08:53,605
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Caraviello.

1545
02:08:53,765 --> 02:08:54,485
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1546
02:08:55,246 --> 02:08:59,767
[SPEAKER_24]: A few weeks ago, we asked for the DARE offices to be reinstated back in the schools.

1547
02:09:00,347 --> 02:09:02,948
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't seen anything happen as of yet.

1548
02:09:03,388 --> 02:09:07,089
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, you know, every week we procrastinate this.

1549
02:09:07,129 --> 02:09:07,949
[SPEAKER_24]: Another person dies.

1550
02:09:07,969 --> 02:09:08,610
[SPEAKER_24]: Two people die.

1551
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:12,791
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, how many more weeks are we going to sit and wait for something to happen, wait for something to happen?

1552
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:17,672
[SPEAKER_24]: Even if we start with something small, we need to get something moving here.

1553
02:09:17,692 --> 02:09:21,794
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, we sit here, we talk, we talk, we talk, meanwhile people die.

1554
02:09:23,515 --> 02:09:25,235
[SPEAKER_24]: Words aren't getting anything done, Mr. President.

1555
02:09:25,796 --> 02:09:27,797
[SPEAKER_24]: Actions are going to start happening then.

1556
02:09:28,597 --> 02:09:33,379
[SPEAKER_24]: We ask for the dear officers to be put back in the schools, and they haven't been put back in as far as I know.

1557
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:34,860
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor.

1558
02:09:38,422 --> 02:09:39,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

1559
02:09:40,267 --> 02:09:41,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1560
02:09:41,287 --> 02:09:50,591
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn, because a lot of this does start in the schools, and education is an important piece of this puzzle.

1561
02:09:51,512 --> 02:10:05,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, if, Mr. President, if we could ask the mayor for the update on where the ordinance is, because just in the past few weeks, individuals that attended our meetings, attended our meetings here because their loved ones were affected.

1562
02:10:05,838 --> 02:10:10,140
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had individuals that attended our meeting, and their loved ones have passed since our meeting.

1563
02:10:10,915 --> 02:10:12,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a serious thing.

1564
02:10:12,636 --> 02:10:16,339
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so fluid.

1565
02:10:16,359 --> 02:10:20,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Every day you're picking up the newspaper, you're reading another name.

1566
02:10:21,043 --> 02:10:24,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get this moving.

1567
02:10:24,906 --> 02:10:27,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the mayor is working on it, and it's floating around.

1568
02:10:27,068 --> 02:10:27,848
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

1569
02:10:28,248 --> 02:10:34,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is such an important issue, the mayor should put something out to all the department heads, give them a deadline.

1570
02:10:34,673 --> 02:10:35,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's an ordinance that you have.

1571
02:10:35,714 --> 02:10:37,956
[SPEAKER_07]: You have until the end of business on this day to sign off on it.

1572
02:10:38,663 --> 02:10:39,963
[SPEAKER_07]: and at least get it back to this council.

1573
02:10:39,983 --> 02:10:49,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they're working on it, but as I just demonstrated via the example that I gave, this is something that's affecting people on a daily basis.

1574
02:10:49,925 --> 02:10:57,487
[SPEAKER_07]: In the past two weeks or three weeks since our meeting, there's been several people that have died as a result of this disease.

1575
02:10:57,527 --> 02:10:59,267
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

1576
02:10:59,287 --> 02:11:06,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And on a positive note, thank you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, for bringing this forward, because it does all start in the very small ages in our schools.

1577
02:11:07,329 --> 02:11:08,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor.

1578
02:11:09,758 --> 02:11:10,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Sir, you wish to speak on this?

1579
02:11:11,338 --> 02:11:12,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1580
02:11:13,519 --> 02:11:14,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

1581
02:11:14,999 --> 02:11:17,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I promise this will be the last time I come to the podium tonight.

1582
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:19,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1583
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:25,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Through the chair, I want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn, Vice President, for bringing up this issue.

1584
02:11:26,161 --> 02:11:36,723
[SPEAKER_09]: This past Sunday, April 5th, marked 12 years to the day that my best friend died on an overdose of OxyContin that he bought illegally.

1585
02:11:37,800 --> 02:12:02,727
[SPEAKER_09]: While I strongly advocate being a former teacher, strong educational programs, teaching our youngsters the problems in the health issues and even the death that could arise through using drugs, I would like to ask that this council please place emphasis on the criminal aspect of what's going on here.

1586
02:12:03,289 --> 02:12:07,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks, in an earlier discussion, brought up low staffing.

1587
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:10,951
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have a full police force here in Medford.

1588
02:12:11,171 --> 02:12:15,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And Councilor Caraviello brought up the DARE officer program.

1589
02:12:16,553 --> 02:12:26,015
[SPEAKER_09]: My question is, you know, how many people that are out there selling illegal drugs to our youngsters and our students, how many of them are being arrested?

1590
02:12:27,056 --> 02:12:31,437
[SPEAKER_09]: If my friend 12 years ago, you know, from the person, whoever it was, he bought

1591
02:12:32,239 --> 02:12:42,086
[SPEAKER_09]: illegal Oxycontin from got arrested the day before, maybe that night he wouldn't have illegally purchased these drugs and got arrested.

1592
02:12:42,106 --> 02:12:50,592
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's doctors doing it, I hope that there's some aspect of looking into them to get them arrested and losing their license.

1593
02:12:51,873 --> 02:12:57,637
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a strong, fully staffed police force so that they can go out and do their job.

1594
02:12:57,677 --> 02:13:00,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I'm obviously speaking out of turn.

1595
02:13:01,975 --> 02:13:10,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief Sacco is doing everything he can with what he has, and there may be answers to the questions I'm bringing up.

1596
02:13:10,318 --> 02:13:17,300
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to know how many arrests were made in the last month, in the last three months, the last year, on people selling drugs.

1597
02:13:18,841 --> 02:13:24,043
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of prevention, from a legal standpoint, I think needs some emphasis as well.

1598
02:13:24,163 --> 02:13:25,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1599
02:13:26,935 --> 02:13:29,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Vice President Lago-Carnes.

1600
02:13:29,977 --> 02:13:32,058
[SPEAKER_23]: Just on that note, thank you, President Dello Russo.

1601
02:13:32,758 --> 02:13:41,642
[SPEAKER_23]: Chief Sacco and Detective Sacco were actually at our meeting, and Detective Sacco is pretty on top of the situation.

1602
02:13:41,702 --> 02:13:43,583
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, he spoke about arrests.

1603
02:13:43,623 --> 02:13:47,445
[SPEAKER_23]: He spoke about the issues that the detectives are facing.

1604
02:13:47,505 --> 02:13:52,888
[SPEAKER_23]: He spoke about being in court and, you know, a whole host of issues.

1605
02:13:52,928 --> 02:13:54,069
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, they are on top of it.

1606
02:13:54,309 --> 02:13:56,430
[SPEAKER_23]: Things have to change at the state level.

1607
02:13:56,908 --> 02:14:02,409
[SPEAKER_23]: with regards to some of the laws and regulations and the classifications of fentanyl.

1608
02:14:02,569 --> 02:14:03,670
[SPEAKER_23]: I know that he spoke about.

1609
02:14:03,730 --> 02:14:05,850
[SPEAKER_23]: So he's pretty compassionate about the issue.

1610
02:14:05,930 --> 02:14:08,431
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know there are arrests being made.

1611
02:14:08,471 --> 02:14:10,251
[SPEAKER_23]: And I've witnessed it firsthand.

1612
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:12,012
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to let you know.

1613
02:14:12,092 --> 02:14:13,112
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't aware of that.

1614
02:14:13,292 --> 02:14:15,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope more arrests are being made.

1615
02:14:16,313 --> 02:14:19,093
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you for informing me on that, Vice President.

1616
02:14:19,373 --> 02:14:19,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1617
02:14:19,934 --> 02:14:20,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1618
02:14:21,174 --> 02:14:21,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

1619
02:14:21,834 --> 02:14:23,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Please state your name and address for the record, sir.

1620
02:14:23,834 --> 02:14:24,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1621
02:14:24,195 --> 02:14:25,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1622
02:14:26,668 --> 02:14:31,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Kibushi had brought up Right Turn, which is the drug counseling people in Arlington.

1623
02:14:32,169 --> 02:14:34,070
[SPEAKER_06]: They're now doing TV ads, Woody Geisman.

1624
02:14:34,510 --> 02:14:35,630
[SPEAKER_06]: He does fantastic work.

1625
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:41,271
[SPEAKER_06]: We should see about him coming down to the council and speaking to the council, because it's right in Arlington Center.

1626
02:14:41,711 --> 02:14:47,432
[SPEAKER_06]: These are people that have gone through drug problems, and they're helping to educate the community and keep people straight.

1627
02:14:47,832 --> 02:14:48,973
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very, very good thing.

1628
02:14:50,013 --> 02:14:55,334
[SPEAKER_06]: If we had public access TV, we could have these discussions every day, and we could educate the public on it.

1629
02:14:57,030 --> 02:14:57,730
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have that.

1630
02:14:58,790 --> 02:15:02,091
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my musicians, his son died, about 23 years old.

1631
02:15:02,251 --> 02:15:05,172
[SPEAKER_06]: The grandmother found him in the bed, overdose of heroin.

1632
02:15:06,132 --> 02:15:06,812
[SPEAKER_06]: It is everywhere.

1633
02:15:06,952 --> 02:15:08,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's been touched by it.

1634
02:15:08,673 --> 02:15:10,533
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend grieves for his son.

1635
02:15:11,073 --> 02:15:12,974
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, what do you say to someone?

1636
02:15:13,074 --> 02:15:13,814
[SPEAKER_06]: What can you say?

1637
02:15:15,834 --> 02:15:19,435
[SPEAKER_06]: You just try to help them through it, but it is pervasive.

1638
02:15:19,655 --> 02:15:20,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awful.

1639
02:15:20,756 --> 02:15:23,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is not self-serving.

1640
02:15:23,336 --> 02:15:25,737
[SPEAKER_06]: We need public access TV to educate the community.

1641
02:15:25,777 --> 02:15:26,617
[SPEAKER_06]: We're paying for it.

1642
02:15:27,358 --> 02:15:30,101
[SPEAKER_06]: This crisis is a very good example of why we need it.

1643
02:15:33,965 --> 02:15:37,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor, sir?

1644
02:15:37,849 --> 02:15:38,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1645
02:15:38,249 --> 02:15:39,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1646
02:15:40,011 --> 02:15:40,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Ruggiero.

1647
02:15:40,772 --> 02:15:42,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1648
02:15:43,394 --> 02:15:50,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to advise the council to consider not just doing something, but doing something that's scientifically proven to actually work.

1649
02:15:51,708 --> 02:15:52,388
[SPEAKER_02]: While D.A.R.E.

1650
02:15:52,528 --> 02:15:59,450
[SPEAKER_02]: programs have had some small positive influence, many different journals and scientific papers have shown that the D.A.R.E.

1651
02:15:59,490 --> 02:16:01,031
[SPEAKER_02]: program has been rather ineffective.

1652
02:16:02,151 --> 02:16:03,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at one right now.

1653
02:16:03,452 --> 02:16:09,774
[SPEAKER_02]: The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a pretty widespread paper called Project D.A.R.E.

1654
02:16:09,814 --> 02:16:11,254
[SPEAKER_02]: No Effects at 10-Year Follow-Up.

1655
02:16:11,814 --> 02:16:13,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Work needs to be done, obviously.

1656
02:16:14,115 --> 02:16:16,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Heroin is a serious problem in our community.

1657
02:16:17,016 --> 02:16:19,637
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's not just what we do, but why we do it.

1658
02:16:20,649 --> 02:16:21,870
[SPEAKER_02]: the reasons for our change.

1659
02:16:22,210 --> 02:16:22,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1660
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:23,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1661
02:16:23,771 --> 02:16:24,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Counsel Fanta.

1662
02:16:24,951 --> 02:16:25,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

1663
02:16:25,852 --> 02:16:26,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, thank you.

1664
02:16:26,732 --> 02:16:29,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Counsel Lingo, because I, I, it does, it touches everybody.

1665
02:16:29,594 --> 02:16:36,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, this past Friday, a good friend of the family, 25 years old in New Hampshire doesn't make any difference where it comes from.

1666
02:16:36,617 --> 02:16:38,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Died of an overdose.

1667
02:16:38,298 --> 02:16:38,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1668
02:16:39,118 --> 02:16:43,841
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's, it's, it's a sad situation, but I just like to travel back in time.

1669
02:16:43,881 --> 02:16:49,844
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you remember when we had this mini epidemic that was going on in the schools and the elementary grade,

1670
02:16:50,670 --> 02:16:51,771
[SPEAKER_08]: with the stamps.

1671
02:16:51,971 --> 02:16:57,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when they were licking the stamps and there was drugs in the stamps and the kids got hooked on it?

1672
02:16:57,855 --> 02:17:01,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you may have been on the school committee at the time, Councilman LSD, okay?

1673
02:17:02,398 --> 02:17:06,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were giving it to the kids for nothing back then to get them hooked on it.

1674
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:11,043
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just so such a, it was a sad state of affairs back then.

1675
02:17:11,063 --> 02:17:15,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think parents and the schools, everybody got involved with it and stuff like that.

1676
02:17:16,118 --> 02:17:24,362
[SPEAKER_08]: When you talk about education, Councilor Lingo, I think every teacher, from kindergarten all the way up, needs to be educated on this particular subject matter.

1677
02:17:25,423 --> 02:17:29,785
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an educational course that's not English or history or social studies.

1678
02:17:29,805 --> 02:17:34,367
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an educational course of everyday life that's taking place in their classroom.

1679
02:17:35,108 --> 02:17:43,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And the child, other than having their parents at home, it's the teacher in the classroom that probably has them more at a confined time and period

1680
02:17:43,685 --> 02:17:46,187
[SPEAKER_08]: than any other time in their life as they're growing up.

1681
02:17:46,968 --> 02:17:49,490
[SPEAKER_08]: And the teachers need to recognize all the shortcomings.

1682
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:56,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the fact of the matter is, and I don't know, somebody out there mentioned the fact about, you know, the criminal aspect of it, and it's true.

1683
02:17:57,136 --> 02:18:11,708
[SPEAKER_08]: There needs to be, that component has to be attacked just as well because there has to be something that destroys the idea of having a seller give these drugs out or kids get themselves addicted to it and what have you.

1684
02:18:12,158 --> 02:18:23,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that there's a law out there right now that says if you have any kind of a drug or you sell it within 1,000 feet or is it 500 feet of a school, it's a mandatory two or three years, whatever it might be.

1685
02:18:23,787 --> 02:18:31,472
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's been proponents for years going up on Beacon Hill saying that anyone who gets caught selling drugs to a student should have a mandatory five-year sentence.

1686
02:18:31,493 --> 02:18:32,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there was some as high as 10 years.

1687
02:18:33,894 --> 02:18:36,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether that's the issue to stop it or not, I don't know.

1688
02:18:36,176 --> 02:18:40,139
[SPEAKER_08]: But the fact of the matter is that they're out there selling it, and there are more people using

1689
02:18:40,785 --> 02:18:42,305
[SPEAKER_08]: harrowing now than ever before.

1690
02:18:42,325 --> 02:18:49,667
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that day, it couldn't have been any more telling when that lady stood up there at that vigil and told us that she didn't lose one, but she lost two sons.

1691
02:18:50,267 --> 02:18:53,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And she lost a second son after he was four years clean.

1692
02:18:54,968 --> 02:18:57,189
[SPEAKER_08]: This is — it just doesn't go away.

1693
02:18:57,249 --> 02:19:00,230
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's something that a parent has to live with, day in and day out.

1694
02:19:01,410 --> 02:19:08,192
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all around this rail subject to — whether it's our own kids, our grandkids, or relatives within our family, or friends outside the family.

1695
02:19:08,792 --> 02:19:10,052
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's out there.

1696
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:15,304
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the police department, whether it's local, state, or federal, they have a big job in their hands.

1697
02:19:15,464 --> 02:19:19,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they need to do, and what the judges need to do, they need to step up to the plateau.

1698
02:19:19,887 --> 02:19:26,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of giving them a slap on the wrist, or giving them suspended sentences, they need to send them away and do their job.

1699
02:19:26,333 --> 02:19:34,119
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe they should build the jails in Wellesley, and Newton, and Lexington, and the high-priced towns where a lot of these people are doing the selling, and that's where they're coming from.

1700
02:19:34,759 --> 02:19:39,343
[SPEAKER_08]: It affects every single body, and every single life, and every single community, rich, poor, and indifferent.

1701
02:19:39,915 --> 02:19:41,456
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thank you, Councilor Langel.

1702
02:19:41,476 --> 02:19:42,037
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know something?

1703
02:19:42,057 --> 02:19:43,058
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'd like to have you do?

1704
02:19:43,358 --> 02:19:44,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to put an amendment on there.

1705
02:19:44,659 --> 02:19:57,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to have you have the superintendent of schools report back to this council, and I'd like to have you give him a time period that what he is doing within his school system with his teachers, so we all have an idea as to what's going on.

1706
02:19:58,550 --> 02:20:08,017
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that puts the pressure on that, hey, if you're really serious about addressing this thing within our school system, because this council is serious about it, because we've all affected it,

1707
02:20:08,323 --> 02:20:15,748
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all been affected by a loss by someone, immediate or otherwise, then we're doing something about it, and we want to see it.

1708
02:20:15,788 --> 02:20:17,230
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to see it in the agenda.

1709
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:31,440
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to see it in the budget of the school department, and we want to have it come and televised and publicized to every single taxpayer in this community what they should be on the lookout for, because the school department's going to do it, and the parents should be apprised of it as well.

1710
02:20:34,564 --> 02:20:35,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

1711
02:20:35,744 --> 02:20:36,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

1712
02:20:36,805 --> 02:20:37,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1713
02:20:37,165 --> 02:20:42,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And just an FYI, a gentleman that was at the podium just was speaking about right turn over in Arlington.

1714
02:20:43,266 --> 02:20:46,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a great resource for youngsters throughout the communities around here.

1715
02:20:47,547 --> 02:20:52,428
[SPEAKER_07]: That's closing its doors in the very near future, moving to a faraway community.

1716
02:20:52,708 --> 02:21:00,570
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's another resource that people from Medford utilize and is moving on to a new facility outside of the immediate area.

1717
02:21:00,630 --> 02:21:04,411
[SPEAKER_07]: So just so as quick as we're adding resources,

1718
02:21:05,108 --> 02:21:13,471
[SPEAKER_07]: To combat the problem, resources for whatever reasons are getting depleted as well.

1719
02:21:13,892 --> 02:21:17,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So you take 10 steps forward, then it's five back.

1720
02:21:18,133 --> 02:21:18,954
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's only getting worse.

1721
02:21:19,354 --> 02:21:20,834
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you again, Councilor Lungo.

1722
02:21:21,214 --> 02:21:22,395
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

1723
02:21:22,475 --> 02:21:23,095
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

1724
02:21:23,435 --> 02:21:24,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1725
02:21:25,116 --> 02:21:28,117
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd like to thank Councilor Lungo for bringing the resolution forward.

1726
02:21:28,357 --> 02:21:29,538
[SPEAKER_17]: I certainly feel as though

1727
02:21:30,598 --> 02:21:35,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Education is a vital component to addressing the substance abuse and the opiate abuse issue here in Medford.

1728
02:21:36,363 --> 02:21:37,965
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe it's not there.

1729
02:21:38,265 --> 02:21:47,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe it's other type of programming that we can put in place for self-esteem training for individuals so that they don't have the feeling that they need to go towards drugs to escape from something, Mr. President.

1730
02:21:48,214 --> 02:21:49,995
[SPEAKER_17]: But education is definitely a component.

1731
02:21:50,235 --> 02:21:51,557
[SPEAKER_17]: And public safety is a component, too.

1732
02:21:51,577 --> 02:21:52,698
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no question about that.

1733
02:21:52,738 --> 02:21:54,919
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to keep our drugs off the street, Mr. President.

1734
02:21:54,940 --> 02:21:56,121
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to keep drugs off the street.

1735
02:21:56,991 --> 02:21:58,692
[SPEAKER_17]: limit people's access to drugs.

1736
02:21:58,732 --> 02:22:03,596
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I think it's important to point out that a lot of people that sell drugs actually use drugs, too.

1737
02:22:04,017 --> 02:22:04,957
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know what I mean?

1738
02:22:04,977 --> 02:22:08,860
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not necessarily just a drug dealer, but they themselves are also addicts, Mr. President.

1739
02:22:09,301 --> 02:22:17,227
[SPEAKER_17]: The one component that I don't hear many people talking about is the public health aspect of this and the lack of access to care, Mr. President.

1740
02:22:17,247 --> 02:22:21,810
[SPEAKER_17]: So, an addict that's looking for help can't find access to help, Mr. President.

1741
02:22:21,850 --> 02:22:26,474
[SPEAKER_17]: So, they sit there and they fight and they try to get clean and they can't get clean because they have no way to get help.

1742
02:22:27,087 --> 02:22:30,670
[SPEAKER_17]: And then they fall back into this vicious cycle and this vicious circle again, Mr. President.

1743
02:22:30,950 --> 02:22:33,692
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that there are really three components that we really need to look at.

1744
02:22:33,732 --> 02:22:40,537
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the education, the public safety, and the public health aspect of this in order for us to tackle this epidemic and this problem in its entirety.

1745
02:22:41,298 --> 02:22:44,540
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I can't thank Councilor Longo enough for continuing this conversation.

1746
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:49,904
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we've all been pretty vocal and pretty outspoken in terms of our position on the topic.

1747
02:22:50,024 --> 02:22:54,828
[SPEAKER_17]: And I really do look forward to the response from the school department and also the response from the administration.

1748
02:22:55,371 --> 02:22:59,455
[SPEAKER_17]: as to what direction the ordinance looks like and what direction the school department's going in.

1749
02:22:59,775 --> 02:23:03,938
[SPEAKER_17]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I support this resolution wholeheartedly, and I'd move for approval.

1750
02:23:04,999 --> 02:23:10,344
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Long and Kerr, and seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1751
02:23:11,365 --> 02:23:23,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And as, strike that, have it amended that the superintendent respond back as

1752
02:23:23,702 --> 02:23:27,105
[SPEAKER_08]: to what his plan is for each and every one of the teachers in the school system.

1753
02:23:28,205 --> 02:23:40,674
[SPEAKER_14]: As amended by Councilor Penta, that the Superintendent of Schools report back to the Council regarding to his plans for the entire school system for education.

1754
02:23:40,795 --> 02:23:41,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, prevention.

1755
02:23:42,076 --> 02:23:42,656
[SPEAKER_14]: And prevention.

1756
02:23:43,376 --> 02:23:44,697
[SPEAKER_14]: A roll call has been requested.

1757
02:23:44,737 --> 02:23:46,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

1758
02:23:46,479 --> 02:23:47,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1759
02:23:47,259 --> 02:23:50,822
[SPEAKER_24]: If we could have a report back on that, on our DARE officers, officer.

1760
02:23:51,683 --> 02:24:02,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Further amended by Councilor Caraviello that the Chief of Police report back to the Council regarding the implementation, re-implementation of the D.A.R.

1761
02:24:03,013 --> 02:24:03,433
[SPEAKER_14]: officers.

1762
02:24:04,093 --> 02:24:05,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1763
02:24:06,495 --> 02:24:07,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso?

1764
02:24:07,917 --> 02:24:08,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1765
02:24:08,597 --> 02:24:09,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello?

1766
02:24:09,298 --> 02:24:09,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1767
02:24:09,538 --> 02:24:10,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

1768
02:24:10,839 --> 02:24:10,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1769
02:24:10,959 --> 02:24:12,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Longford?

1770
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:12,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1771
02:24:13,361 --> 02:24:13,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

1772
02:24:14,122 --> 02:24:14,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1773
02:24:14,822 --> 02:24:15,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Patu?

1774
02:24:15,543 --> 02:24:15,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1775
02:24:18,606 --> 02:24:21,667
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 in the affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

1776
02:24:22,768 --> 02:24:23,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta.

1777
02:24:25,649 --> 02:24:42,255
[SPEAKER_08]: On that particular resolution, can we also have a copy of that resolution sent to the governor's opiate, I can't think of the exact title of his commission, because what they're looking for is input from cities and towns as it relates to their concerns as it relates to that.

1778
02:24:42,355 --> 02:24:43,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know the exact

1779
02:24:44,037 --> 02:24:47,618
[SPEAKER_08]: name of the commission, but he has a commission.

1780
02:24:49,338 --> 02:24:56,180
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Opium Addition Tax Force, because if we could send a copy of that to them and keep them apprised.

1781
02:25:01,641 --> 02:25:03,781
[SPEAKER_24]: Isn't our mayor on the MMA?

1782
02:25:04,901 --> 02:25:06,182
[SPEAKER_24]: Isn't he the head of the

1783
02:25:07,467 --> 02:25:07,827
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

1784
02:25:07,907 --> 02:25:10,609
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just a co-chairman of a committee, but I don't know what he's doing.

1785
02:25:10,629 --> 02:25:11,529
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you the co-chair of the OPA committee?

1786
02:25:11,730 --> 02:25:11,870
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1787
02:25:11,970 --> 02:25:13,130
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Penter is as well.

1788
02:25:13,491 --> 02:25:14,511
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I'm not on that committee.

1789
02:25:14,571 --> 02:25:15,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you on that committee, Councilor Penter?

1790
02:25:15,612 --> 02:25:16,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Not on that committee, no.

1791
02:25:16,913 --> 02:25:17,393
[SPEAKER_24]: The mayor is.

1792
02:25:17,833 --> 02:25:20,415
[SPEAKER_24]: If you could find out where that committee is through the MMA.

1793
02:25:21,756 --> 02:25:26,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, when he gave that comment at the vigil, I think they said they were- Did he dispose of the matter already?

1794
02:25:26,298 --> 02:25:27,379
[SPEAKER_08]: He said he was working on it.

1795
02:25:27,399 --> 02:25:28,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what he's doing.

1796
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:29,240
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, but that was three weeks ago.

1797
02:25:31,061 --> 02:25:32,502
[SPEAKER_24]: Three weeks ago, and a bunch more people died.

1798
02:25:33,022 --> 02:25:33,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1799
02:25:33,603 --> 02:25:33,883
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1800
02:25:36,577 --> 02:25:55,158
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-333 offered by council Camuso be resolved that the DPW install additional crosswalk signs in West Medford Square in the interest of public safety council Camuso Thank You mr. President West Medford the signage is lacking and residents have reached out to me over this past I

1801
02:25:56,056 --> 02:26:06,942
[SPEAKER_07]: week or so to see if we can get additional crosswalk signs down in the immediate area near the Two Sisters, in the Seafood, it's still called the Seafood Depot, what's the name of it now?

1802
02:26:06,962 --> 02:26:16,707
[SPEAKER_07]: The Seafood Grill, I think, but, Seafood Grill, thanks, Councilor Penta, and then down the street as well near Sunnyhurst, just the whole area.

1803
02:26:16,907 --> 02:26:21,830
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people traverse it, and additional signage definitely will be very helpful.

1804
02:26:22,472 --> 02:26:28,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Councilor Marks put something on a few weeks ago, a B paper, regarding doing the crosswalks over.

1805
02:26:29,295 --> 02:26:33,776
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can make that a priority as well, because as we all know, we're all got the same emails.

1806
02:26:34,237 --> 02:26:46,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Since this appeared on the agenda, people from the pedestrian committee have reached out to the entire council about improving crosswalks throughout the entire community.

1807
02:26:46,617 --> 02:26:52,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And the one recommendation that was made to me, as well as all the members of the council, and me personally, I think it was a good idea.

1808
02:26:52,721 --> 02:26:56,443
[SPEAKER_07]: We should be going with the new crosswalk signs, similar to the Winthrop Street Rotary.

1809
02:26:56,704 --> 02:27:02,007
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the fluorescent, real, real bright at night.

1810
02:27:02,588 --> 02:27:06,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could send that to the DPW.

1811
02:27:08,952 --> 02:27:11,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, Madam President, thank you very much.

1812
02:27:11,053 --> 02:27:13,975
[SPEAKER_17]: And Councilor Camuso, thank you very much for bringing this resolution forward.

1813
02:27:15,228 --> 02:27:33,231
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to add by way of a B paper, a resolution that would ask that the Department of Transportation repair the stanchions that stand between the eastbound and westbound roadways at the railroad crossing.

1814
02:27:33,492 --> 02:27:35,912
[SPEAKER_17]: After this winter, they took quite a beat and they were all broken.

1815
02:27:35,932 --> 02:27:36,852
[SPEAKER_17]: They're in disrepair.

1816
02:27:37,372 --> 02:27:41,173
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I remember correctly, those stanchions were installed

1817
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:47,682
[SPEAKER_17]: for the purpose of improving public safety at the railroad crossing for pedestrians and vehicles alike.

1818
02:27:48,362 --> 02:27:51,263
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's relevant to the topic.

1819
02:27:51,964 --> 02:27:55,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they all fall under the DOT now through the transportation reform.

1820
02:27:55,885 --> 02:28:05,668
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to amend the paper by way of a B paper asking that the DOT take appropriate steps and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority take the appropriate steps to repair the stations.

1821
02:28:08,569 --> 02:28:09,469
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Carmelo.

1822
02:28:09,489 --> 02:28:10,990
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Layton, are you talking to West Medford?

1823
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:13,100
[SPEAKER_24]: They just fell down.

1824
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:14,081
[SPEAKER_24]: Those are new.

1825
02:28:15,042 --> 02:28:16,402
[SPEAKER_24]: About three weeks ago, they got knocked down.

1826
02:28:16,442 --> 02:28:17,283
[SPEAKER_24]: They had to put a new one up there.

1827
02:28:19,424 --> 02:28:28,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam President, the reason I was on council of our commercial senior, every year, the DPW just paints the crosswalks on.

1828
02:28:28,750 --> 02:28:34,773
[SPEAKER_24]: Other cities, they use that hot paint with the sand and everything, so they raise it a little bit.

1829
02:28:35,193 --> 02:28:37,395
[SPEAKER_24]: And why can't we do that instead of just painting them?

1830
02:28:38,435 --> 02:28:40,496
[SPEAKER_24]: I know Councilman, it sounds like an odd idea.

1831
02:28:43,152 --> 02:28:48,057
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe if we do something, you know, spend a little extra money and do it right the first time, we won't have to be doing it every year.

1832
02:28:48,097 --> 02:28:53,303
[SPEAKER_24]: But in other cities, they come in with the hot paint and there's like a little sand and everything, and they'll stay for two or three years.

1833
02:28:54,244 --> 02:29:02,473
[SPEAKER_24]: So rather than just paint, if we could, you know, get them done, maybe if the city can't do it, maybe we hire an outside company to do it if we don't have the equipment to do it.

1834
02:29:03,074 --> 02:29:03,234
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1835
02:29:07,852 --> 02:29:08,813
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1836
02:29:08,853 --> 02:29:14,677
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to thank Councilor Camuso for bringing up this very important public safety pedestrian issue.

1837
02:29:15,418 --> 02:29:21,122
[SPEAKER_22]: I would also ask that we amend this to include other parts of the city as well.

1838
02:29:21,782 --> 02:29:25,925
[SPEAKER_22]: This is an issue throughout the community, the lack of signage.

1839
02:29:27,026 --> 02:29:31,969
[SPEAKER_22]: And the issue that Councilor Caraviello was just mentioning is thermoplastic.

1840
02:29:32,570 --> 02:29:35,572
[SPEAKER_22]: And anyone that's been on the council for a number of years will remember

1841
02:29:36,123 --> 02:29:42,606
[SPEAKER_22]: that it was about six years ago that we painted about 30 crosswalks with thermoplastic.

1842
02:29:43,187 --> 02:29:45,188
[SPEAKER_22]: And Councilor Caraviello is 100% right.

1843
02:29:45,228 --> 02:29:46,628
[SPEAKER_22]: It's slip resistant.

1844
02:29:46,748 --> 02:29:47,749
[SPEAKER_22]: It's highly reflective.

1845
02:29:48,409 --> 02:29:53,172
[SPEAKER_22]: It lasts up to five years, so we don't have to worry about repainting them every year.

1846
02:29:53,812 --> 02:29:55,913
[SPEAKER_22]: And I thought it was a success.

1847
02:29:56,514 --> 02:30:09,621
[SPEAKER_22]: and that that pilot program of 30 crosswalks was gonna continue, and shortly after that, the city administration discontinued using thermoplastic crosswalks, or thermoplastic, I should say.

1848
02:30:10,021 --> 02:30:17,325
[SPEAKER_22]: The state uses it on all state highways, so that must tell you that it's long-lasting and it's highly reflective.

1849
02:30:17,866 --> 02:30:19,827
[SPEAKER_22]: But in this city, we opt to

1850
02:30:21,596 --> 02:30:27,659
[SPEAKER_22]: put forth 50 resolutions a year to ask that our crosswalks be painted.

1851
02:30:28,659 --> 02:30:33,782
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's no reflection on DPW, which is understaffed, as I mentioned earlier.

1852
02:30:34,642 --> 02:30:39,224
[SPEAKER_22]: However, you know, we have far too many crosswalks in this community.

1853
02:30:39,905 --> 02:30:41,165
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think you're right.

1854
02:30:41,225 --> 02:30:50,190
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe it is time that we look at bringing in a private company to assist in the painting of crosswalks

1855
02:30:51,102 --> 02:30:54,525
[SPEAKER_22]: And thermoplastic would be a preference.

1856
02:30:56,166 --> 02:31:09,316
[SPEAKER_22]: However, I'm not sure if this administration really, to be quite frank, cares about the condition of crosswalks or pedestrian safety, for that fact, in our community.

1857
02:31:10,057 --> 02:31:11,698
[SPEAKER_22]: There's been no traffic calming.

1858
02:31:12,929 --> 02:31:15,490
[SPEAKER_22]: approaches done by this city.

1859
02:31:16,150 --> 02:31:20,031
[SPEAKER_22]: The last thing we did was the raised crosswalk on Winthrop Street.

1860
02:31:20,751 --> 02:31:27,333
[SPEAKER_22]: We were promised two additional crosswalks, one on Central Ave and one on Harvard, that are yet to be done.

1861
02:31:28,214 --> 02:31:33,195
[SPEAKER_22]: But those are really the only traffic calming approaches that I can think of.

1862
02:31:35,291 --> 02:31:37,772
[SPEAKER_22]: And we don't have to recreate the wheel.

1863
02:31:37,812 --> 02:31:58,740
[SPEAKER_22]: All you need to do is look at Cambridge, and they have under their pedestrian DPW section of their website a whole traffic calming section about widening sidewalks, about raised crosswalks, about a host of issues on how to create pedestrian safety in a community.

1864
02:31:59,260 --> 02:32:01,841
[SPEAKER_22]: But for some reason, we just keep on

1865
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:09,346
[SPEAKER_22]: doing the same thing over and over again, and the administration appears to be content with that, Madam President.

1866
02:32:09,366 --> 02:32:12,828
[SPEAKER_22]: So I agree with Councilor Camuso's recommendation.

1867
02:32:12,848 --> 02:32:28,741
[SPEAKER_22]: I would just add, if we can add, if Councilor Camuso doesn't mind, crosswalk signs in all parts of the community, because they are needed, and that thermoplastic be looked at on any painting done in this community from here on, Madam President.

1868
02:32:28,761 --> 02:32:32,064
[SPEAKER_22]: It may be a little more expensive, but in the long run, it's cost-effective.

1869
02:32:35,211 --> 02:32:35,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

1870
02:32:35,991 --> 02:32:44,394
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, during one of the meetings we had a few weeks ago, Ann Baker said, we've been collecting over $1 million a year in extra excise tax.

1871
02:32:46,174 --> 02:32:54,517
[SPEAKER_24]: The excise tax money should be going to fixing the roads for road repair.

1872
02:32:54,557 --> 02:32:58,558
[SPEAKER_24]: More than it was budgeted every year because of people releasing cars every year.

1873
02:32:59,118 --> 02:33:02,720
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think, as she said, last year we collected over $1.1 million.

1874
02:33:04,867 --> 02:33:06,929
[SPEAKER_24]: over and above what was budgeted on the excise tax.

1875
02:33:16,716 --> 02:33:17,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1876
02:33:17,437 --> 02:33:22,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was corrected by my council colleague and the young woman from West Medford.

1877
02:33:23,221 --> 02:33:24,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I said Sunnyhurst Farms.

1878
02:33:24,582 --> 02:33:27,905
[SPEAKER_07]: As we all know, Sunnyhurst Farms is now Goulding School of Dance.

1879
02:33:28,125 --> 02:33:29,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I meant to say the West Medford Spa.

1880
02:33:34,472 --> 02:33:34,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

1881
02:33:35,212 --> 02:33:35,352
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1882
02:33:39,353 --> 02:34:00,779
[SPEAKER_23]: Offered by Council Penta, 1-5-334 be resolved with the Mayor's continual failure as requested by the City, by the Council on many occasions to provide adequate lighting correction to the downtown Medford Square area and the Route 16 parking lot next to the Condon Shell parking needs further discussion in the interest of Medford's public safety.

1883
02:34:00,919 --> 02:34:01,500
[SPEAKER_23]: Council Penta.

1884
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:08,442
[SPEAKER_08]: The card and shelf, this is probably, I think, maybe the 14th time that this council has addressed this.

1885
02:34:10,243 --> 02:34:12,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just don't know why the mayor just doesn't want to listen.

1886
02:34:13,004 --> 02:34:18,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Four months now, I mean, four weeks now into downtown Medford Square, and again, the lights are out.

1887
02:34:18,507 --> 02:34:21,849
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can go to all the squares, and it's epidemic.

1888
02:34:22,229 --> 02:34:31,133
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, National Grid, which has the lights for the city of Medford, used to have a gentleman at nighttime drive around the city, and he would identify all the lights that were out, and they would be repaired.

1889
02:34:31,618 --> 02:34:37,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that stopped some time ago, and since that stopped, the city of Medford has done nothing to pick up the slack as it relates to that.

1890
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:49,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you have to be blind not to realize, when you're driving through Medford Square right now, that there are eight lights out between CVS and going toward the banks and into the square.

1891
02:34:49,544 --> 02:34:50,944
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, public safety is a big thing.

1892
02:34:51,344 --> 02:34:57,847
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have to ask the chief of police, as I said today, what is your biggest public safety concern as it relates to breaking and entering?

1893
02:34:58,087 --> 02:34:59,187
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, it's lighting.

1894
02:34:59,826 --> 02:35:03,347
[SPEAKER_08]: And in downtown Medford, you go to Haines Square, you go to West Medford, you go to North Medford.

1895
02:35:04,327 --> 02:35:05,327
[SPEAKER_08]: These lights are just out.

1896
02:35:05,387 --> 02:35:10,228
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know what it's going to take for the mayor to realize that he has a responsibility.

1897
02:35:10,528 --> 02:35:15,989
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got to come out of that corner office that he hides in all day long, and he doesn't want to see what's going on.

1898
02:35:16,909 --> 02:35:18,130
[SPEAKER_08]: He needs to see what's going on.

1899
02:35:18,150 --> 02:35:19,470
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a public safety issue.

1900
02:35:20,010 --> 02:35:21,270
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going on each and every day.

1901
02:35:21,510 --> 02:35:24,131
[SPEAKER_08]: This is four weeks running now that those lights are out.

1902
02:35:24,791 --> 02:35:27,352
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no excuse to say that we don't have personnel.

1903
02:35:27,712 --> 02:35:29,352
[SPEAKER_08]: From my understanding, they just got through hiring

1904
02:35:29,674 --> 02:35:34,035
[SPEAKER_08]: a new gentleman that's going to be in charge of the electrical department, a former Metro resident.

1905
02:35:34,335 --> 02:35:37,396
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, it isn't like they don't have anybody.

1906
02:35:37,416 --> 02:35:38,576
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have the personnel.

1907
02:35:39,076 --> 02:35:48,278
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they need to stagger a person for one day a week at nighttime to drive around to identify the lights that are out and then go out and correct them during the day, then just do it.

1908
02:35:48,698 --> 02:35:49,978
[SPEAKER_08]: National Grid is not doing it.

1909
02:35:51,099 --> 02:35:52,539
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to do it, again.

1910
02:35:53,057 --> 02:35:55,818
[SPEAKER_08]: This is leadership that is so broken and fallen apart.

1911
02:35:56,139 --> 02:35:57,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea.

1912
02:35:57,479 --> 02:36:02,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I have absolutely no idea what's going on and how this city runs on so many of these issues.

1913
02:36:03,062 --> 02:36:04,703
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is a public safety issue.

1914
02:36:05,003 --> 02:36:08,285
[SPEAKER_08]: You can speak to the chief of police and every police officer will tell you the same thing.

1915
02:36:08,685 --> 02:36:21,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Once those lights go out and as the lights continue to go out, it does present a public safety to a public person walking, driving, and to the value and to the safety of the store.

1916
02:36:21,825 --> 02:36:29,468
[SPEAKER_08]: that these lights are supposedly on there to shine on and to protect people's business investments here in the city of Medford.

1917
02:36:29,708 --> 02:36:42,954
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bad enough you go down residential streets and some of the lights are out, but when they're in the downtown business working area and the lights are out, you have now multiplied that problem for an incident of crime to take place or an accident to take place.

1918
02:36:43,714 --> 02:36:49,957
[SPEAKER_08]: So that being said, Madam President, I move that the Medford City Council on a roll call vote tell the mayor to

1919
02:36:50,395 --> 02:36:53,676
[SPEAKER_08]: get these lights on immediately in the interest of public safety.

1920
02:36:56,037 --> 02:36:57,258
[SPEAKER_23]: Council President De La Rousseau.

1921
02:36:57,918 --> 02:37:00,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam President.

1922
02:37:00,839 --> 02:37:13,185
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, three years, three years, Councilor Penta has asked for the lighting to be addressed in the parking area at the Condon Shell.

1923
02:37:13,745 --> 02:37:18,087
[SPEAKER_14]: It would have been nice also to have more ambient and decorative lighting.

1924
02:37:18,782 --> 02:37:24,023
[SPEAKER_14]: put in along the pathways that are down there, too, that meander through on their way up to Winthrop Street.

1925
02:37:24,083 --> 02:37:26,664
[SPEAKER_14]: But maybe that's asking for luxury.

1926
02:37:27,164 --> 02:37:35,185
[SPEAKER_14]: However, in the interest of public safety, could we have at least a response, Madam President?

1927
02:37:36,145 --> 02:37:37,406
[SPEAKER_14]: This is out of our purview.

1928
02:37:38,426 --> 02:37:39,426
[SPEAKER_14]: This can't be done.

1929
02:37:39,906 --> 02:37:40,946
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't afford it.

1930
02:37:41,827 --> 02:37:43,367
[SPEAKER_14]: The MDC is supposed to do it.

1931
02:37:43,767 --> 02:37:45,967
[SPEAKER_14]: But we've gotten nothing, Madam President.

1932
02:37:46,588 --> 02:37:48,608
[SPEAKER_14]: And furthermore, throughout the city,

1933
02:37:49,409 --> 02:37:58,377
[SPEAKER_14]: where we've had the Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs work on matters regarding lighting and improvements in that matter.

1934
02:37:59,578 --> 02:38:08,305
[SPEAKER_14]: We've seen great success and they've made efforts to utilize new and improved lighting.

1935
02:38:09,206 --> 02:38:16,913
[SPEAKER_14]: That new one, the new type of lighting that uses the LED lighting has been instituted up at

1936
02:38:17,658 --> 02:38:23,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford High School through a grant, we need to see this throughout the city and she's getting it done.

1937
02:38:24,761 --> 02:38:31,765
[SPEAKER_14]: And so maybe this can be done with some sort of grant through the Department of Conservation and Recreation down at their parking lot.

1938
02:38:32,285 --> 02:38:35,027
[SPEAKER_14]: But we should just be seeing progress and success in this.

1939
02:38:35,707 --> 02:38:46,132
[SPEAKER_14]: And especially since that becomes then a cost effective and suitable alternative for parking under our new parking management program,

1940
02:38:47,080 --> 02:39:09,231
[SPEAKER_14]: So to utilize that space down at the Shell, it becomes more and more imperative that this lighting be installed and also that further efforts at public safety and improvement along the walkways and crosswalks over the bridge so people can traverse into Medford Square.

1941
02:39:09,551 --> 02:39:12,532
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm supportive of Councilor Penta in this resolution.

1942
02:39:15,022 --> 02:39:19,925
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Penta, for bringing this resolution forward yet again.

1943
02:39:21,587 --> 02:39:25,349
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that, at the very least, we deserve a response on this.

1944
02:39:25,789 --> 02:39:29,832
[SPEAKER_17]: When I saw this resolution on the agenda, I scratched my head and I said, this sounds eerily familiar.

1945
02:39:30,532 --> 02:39:31,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Sounds eerily familiar.

1946
02:39:31,333 --> 02:39:33,654
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I might have heard this once or twice or three times before.

1947
02:39:34,375 --> 02:39:38,418
[SPEAKER_17]: So I did a little research and a little digging, and I took a look, Madam President,

1948
02:39:40,093 --> 02:39:48,636
[SPEAKER_17]: The Condon Shell Park and Lot, I believe, is under the control and jurisdiction at one point or another by the DCI or the MDC, now the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs.

1949
02:39:49,996 --> 02:39:55,958
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you go on the website and you look up the Mystic River Reservation, the first thing it says is that the park is open from dawn till dusk.

1950
02:39:56,939 --> 02:39:58,679
[SPEAKER_17]: And the park is supposed to close when the sun goes down.

1951
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:04,641
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would lead me to believe that that's probably why we're not getting a response, because no one's supposed to be in there after dusk.

1952
02:40:05,021 --> 02:40:06,942
[SPEAKER_17]: But regardless of whether or not

1953
02:40:08,105 --> 02:40:09,606
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a five year service agreement with them.

1954
02:40:09,706 --> 02:40:10,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that is correct.

1955
02:40:10,486 --> 02:40:11,807
[SPEAKER_17]: So we do have a service agreement with them.

1956
02:40:11,887 --> 02:40:14,108
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's an agreement for the city of Metro to service the property.

1957
02:40:14,608 --> 02:40:20,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, however, I think that that might be the sticking point right here is the fact that, you know, the, the parking lot supposed to be closed after dusk.

1958
02:40:20,591 --> 02:40:23,753
[SPEAKER_17]: So there might not be a willingness to make an investment there.

1959
02:40:24,233 --> 02:40:29,676
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, however, misguided that unwillingness is, um, I feel as though, you know, the parking lot should be lit.

1960
02:40:29,696 --> 02:40:31,377
[SPEAKER_17]: People should feel safe when they park there.

1961
02:40:32,413 --> 02:40:34,194
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think that we really need to get to the bottom of this.

1962
02:40:34,474 --> 02:40:36,055
[SPEAKER_17]: And the question is why?

1963
02:40:36,475 --> 02:40:37,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Why isn't it happening?

1964
02:40:37,795 --> 02:40:47,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Give us an answer, at the very least, something that we can say, okay, agree with or not agree with, or something that we can come up with a plan to circumvent or to work within those confines, Madam President.

1965
02:40:48,639 --> 02:40:58,823
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I certainly can understand Councilor Penta's frustration, and I think that, you know, moving forward, you know, I think we should pass this resolution this evening, but moving forward, if in fact we have to bring it forward yet again,

1966
02:40:59,267 --> 02:41:03,170
[SPEAKER_17]: that we have to get everybody in the room at the same time and say, what's going on?

1967
02:41:03,270 --> 02:41:04,291
[SPEAKER_17]: And we want an answer on this.

1968
02:41:04,671 --> 02:41:09,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it's very easy to send a resolution and wait for a response, and then it gets mixed in with other responses.

1969
02:41:10,095 --> 02:41:12,357
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the very least, respond.

1970
02:41:12,537 --> 02:41:13,458
[SPEAKER_17]: And we haven't gotten that yet.

1971
02:41:13,558 --> 02:41:18,982
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that everybody behind this rail's had it up to here in terms of not getting a response on this very issue.

1972
02:41:19,382 --> 02:41:23,766
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, Madam President, I'm in whole support of the resolution.

1973
02:41:24,266 --> 02:41:29,070
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we can go a step further maybe if this isn't resolved within the requisite 10 days.

1974
02:41:29,780 --> 02:41:37,642
[SPEAKER_17]: to bring officials from the administration and the DCI down here to tell us why, what's going on, what's it going to cost, and what we can do to make it happen.

1975
02:41:39,283 --> 02:41:39,623
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1976
02:41:39,663 --> 02:41:40,443
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Caraviello.

1977
02:41:40,603 --> 02:41:47,325
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam President, seeing that we have a new representative, Representative Barber, why don't we get her involved?

1978
02:41:47,605 --> 02:41:48,485
[SPEAKER_24]: That's her district.

1979
02:41:48,985 --> 02:41:51,626
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe the state is involved.

1980
02:41:52,006 --> 02:41:58,768
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we can send a letter to her, to have her office get involved with this, maybe she can get a light down there for us.

1981
02:42:00,223 --> 02:42:00,763
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a good idea.

1982
02:42:00,823 --> 02:42:01,444
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Marks.

1983
02:42:02,184 --> 02:42:14,770
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Penta, as was mentioned, he's been persistent on this issue for a number of years and I'm not sure why nothing has happened to date.

1984
02:42:15,751 --> 02:42:27,377
[SPEAKER_22]: But you know, just, I think it was a month ago, a month and a half ago, this council requested that we take down the holiday candles that are still in the square.

1985
02:42:28,373 --> 02:42:30,934
[SPEAKER_22]: And now I'm actually seeing why the mayor's leaving him up.

1986
02:42:31,675 --> 02:42:36,218
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I think his overall master plan is, if the lights go out, he's going to turn the candles on.

1987
02:42:37,378 --> 02:42:40,180
[SPEAKER_22]: And maybe that's his way of lighting up the city.

1988
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:47,524
[SPEAKER_22]: So he may have a bigger project on his hands here, Madam President.

1989
02:42:48,204 --> 02:42:55,889
[SPEAKER_22]: And we asked for the lenses to be replaced.

1990
02:42:56,369 --> 02:42:57,910
[SPEAKER_22]: They replaced the lenses.

1991
02:42:58,303 --> 02:43:00,523
[SPEAKER_22]: The lighting in the square, in my opinion, is still dark.

1992
02:43:00,563 --> 02:43:01,824
[SPEAKER_22]: I know there's a number of lights out.

1993
02:43:02,284 --> 02:43:05,245
[SPEAKER_22]: It's still dark in the square area.

1994
02:43:06,205 --> 02:43:14,687
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's not inviting after dark to go into the square because, you know, let's face it, people want to go and feel safe in a well-lit area.

1995
02:43:15,167 --> 02:43:17,487
[SPEAKER_22]: And Medford Square is not well-lit.

1996
02:43:18,407 --> 02:43:21,028
[SPEAKER_22]: You just get a feeling like it's deserted.

1997
02:43:21,588 --> 02:43:22,128
[SPEAKER_22]: You really do.

1998
02:43:22,188 --> 02:43:25,789
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's a shame that you have businesses down there that have to put up with this.

1999
02:43:26,756 --> 02:43:34,559
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, not only did the mayor implement the parking kiosk to get your money, he's making it so you go down there and you need a flashlight to walk around with.

2000
02:43:35,079 --> 02:43:54,965
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's really getting to a point, and Councilor Penta's right, you know, maybe the mayor should come out of his office or his house and walk around the city and traverse and see the potholes and see the sidewalks that are crumbling and see the lights that are out and go into the restroom across from his office

2001
02:43:55,381 --> 02:44:19,232
[SPEAKER_22]: and see the yellow caution tape around the urinal, and come here at City Hall and see the holes in the ceiling, and then go to the Medford Public Library, which is in Dianita work, and then go to the fire department and the police department that needs work, and maybe he'll see what's going on in this community and get his head out of the sand and move forward on some of these issues, Madam President.

2002
02:44:19,992 --> 02:44:20,313
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

2003
02:44:20,553 --> 02:44:21,073
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Penta.

2004
02:44:21,755 --> 02:44:30,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick, even though, and I appreciate the remarks as it relates to the Route 16, equally as important is the lighting in the downtown area, especially downtown Medford with these lights out.

2005
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:38,604
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, these resolutions just don't go on the agenda lightly as all of us do, because, you know, we're believing we're doing it.

2006
02:44:38,624 --> 02:44:42,486
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we can't get our responses, and that's why I said last week, we have a resolution on there.

2007
02:44:43,046 --> 02:44:49,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope the city clerk has upgraded his thing and he inserted the 10-day slot, because that'll really tell us where we're going.

2008
02:44:49,939 --> 02:44:50,820
[SPEAKER_08]: on a lot of these things.

2009
02:44:50,860 --> 02:45:00,425
[SPEAKER_08]: We still haven't gotten a response back from upstairs on the MS4, which is right around the corner, which is going to be a big cost to the city if, in fact, we have to follow the EPA guidelines.

2010
02:45:00,445 --> 02:45:03,247
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't gotten anything regarding, you know, our street recovery program.

2011
02:45:03,287 --> 02:45:07,650
[SPEAKER_08]: We could just go on and on and on and a whole bunch of issues, but he's just not responding to them.

2012
02:45:07,690 --> 02:45:11,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe because he feels that the council is not bothering him, he's not going to respond to it.

2013
02:45:12,533 --> 02:45:20,079
[SPEAKER_08]: So if that be the case, then maybe what we need to do after Mr. Finn puts that 10-day period in, we just put it on here and we override his veto.

2014
02:45:20,659 --> 02:45:22,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And then from there, it just becomes law.

2015
02:45:23,221 --> 02:45:28,284
[SPEAKER_08]: If I understand the way the rules go, if he doesn't respond within 10 days, it becomes operative.

2016
02:45:28,405 --> 02:45:29,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct, Mr. Finn?

2017
02:45:33,368 --> 02:45:39,973
[SPEAKER_08]: If he does not respond in 10 days, 10 business working days, the resolution asked becomes operative.

2018
02:45:41,146 --> 02:45:45,408
[SPEAKER_08]: And if he sends it back with a no, we take a two-thirds vote and override the veto.

2019
02:45:45,548 --> 02:45:48,330
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we override the veto, then we figure out what needs to be done.

2020
02:45:49,110 --> 02:45:56,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And if he wants to challenge this charter as the charter is written, well, then let it begin now because this is really becoming totally unacceptable.

2021
02:45:57,654 --> 02:45:59,555
[SPEAKER_08]: These resolutions aren't even for ourselves.

2022
02:46:00,215 --> 02:46:02,116
[SPEAKER_08]: These are for the taxpayers of the community.

2023
02:46:02,136 --> 02:46:05,318
[SPEAKER_08]: They pay taxes for what we're talking about.

2024
02:46:06,429 --> 02:46:11,991
[SPEAKER_08]: And that man over there in the corner who wants to play King Solomon, he can't understand what's going on.

2025
02:46:13,871 --> 02:46:15,512
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, we do have a lighting issue.

2026
02:46:15,532 --> 02:46:16,212
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree.

2027
02:46:16,252 --> 02:46:18,993
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to move for approval.

2028
02:46:19,013 --> 02:46:22,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call vote, Madam President, and send it to the mayor.

2029
02:46:24,515 --> 02:46:26,435
[SPEAKER_23]: Roll call vote has been requested.

2030
02:46:26,836 --> 02:46:27,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caruso?

2031
02:46:28,016 --> 02:46:28,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2032
02:46:28,696 --> 02:46:29,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caput?

2033
02:46:29,676 --> 02:46:29,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2034
02:46:29,896 --> 02:46:31,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Neill?

2035
02:46:31,657 --> 02:46:31,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2036
02:46:33,138 --> 02:46:34,098
[SPEAKER_11]: President De La Russa?

2037
02:46:34,138 --> 02:46:34,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2038
02:46:35,687 --> 02:46:36,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Locks?

2039
02:46:36,708 --> 02:46:36,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2040
02:46:37,608 --> 02:46:38,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta?

2041
02:46:38,509 --> 02:46:38,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2042
02:46:40,090 --> 02:46:41,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Lundell-Kern?

2043
02:46:41,511 --> 02:46:41,771
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

2044
02:46:42,312 --> 02:46:44,173
[SPEAKER_23]: The vote is seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2045
02:46:44,193 --> 02:46:44,953
[SPEAKER_23]: The paper passes.

2046
02:46:46,795 --> 02:47:04,467
[SPEAKER_23]: Paper 15-335 offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that since the out-of-state Republic Parking Company that the mayor has hired to collect parking space monies continues to operate in contract violation, they should have their company operational vehicles taken off the road by the police department.

2047
02:47:04,830 --> 02:47:10,751
[SPEAKER_23]: ticketed and be made to pay a fine until such time they adhere to the contract of responsibility.

2048
02:47:10,891 --> 02:47:11,532
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Penta.

2049
02:47:11,792 --> 02:47:18,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, once again today, as late as today, I have pictures here, right here on the infamous ring road.

2050
02:47:18,493 --> 02:47:24,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we have, I think it's Benton Street and South Metro, right down the street from you, Councilor Dello Russo, okay?

2051
02:47:24,975 --> 02:47:31,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we also have, I had a 42-minute conversation with our chief of police tonight as he relates to this.

2052
02:47:31,096 --> 02:47:34,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I told him, chief, the resolution's on there, you know what it's saying, you know what it's all about.

2053
02:47:35,178 --> 02:47:41,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I have tickets here that people continuously keep giving me, telling me that they're collecting monies from the meters that they're not supposed to be collecting.

2054
02:47:41,584 --> 02:47:48,049
[SPEAKER_08]: If you read the contract, the contract tells you how these vehicles are supposed to be addressed and highlighted.

2055
02:47:48,469 --> 02:47:55,275
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Councilor Dello Russo is calling for a meeting, I believe it's Wednesday the 22nd, I believe, or the 23rd, whatever it is.

2056
02:47:55,716 --> 02:48:03,222
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to have the people from Republic, the Chief of Police, and I believe it's the Traffic Commission.

2057
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:14,844
[SPEAKER_08]: And as the council has asked, Mr. Finn, we've asked prior to that meeting to have a list of all the resolutions that the traffic commission has and is voted upon and what's still outstanding.

2058
02:48:15,204 --> 02:48:18,765
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that outstanding Councilor Marks is I asked the chief about it.

2059
02:48:18,785 --> 02:48:28,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I believe that your resolution regarding the 15 minute, um, grace period, I believe today, I, a lady got out of her car in Medford square and she,

2060
02:48:29,612 --> 02:48:57,253
[SPEAKER_08]: walked to the kiosk, and while she walked to the kiosk, the guy from Republic, the bounty hunter from Republic came over, and he gave her a ticket, which is absolutely crazy, because think of this logically, anybody who's out there watching, you go to Bedford Square, you park, and if you're five or six car lengths removed from the kiosk, by the time you go to the kiosk and walk back, how are you supposed to do what you're supposed to do, and the guy is going out there giving these tickets, and today he's holding this handheld thing.

2061
02:48:57,764 --> 02:49:00,967
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not right, it doesn't make any sense, and it's absolutely not fair.

2062
02:49:01,387 --> 02:49:04,769
[SPEAKER_08]: But the real good issue is going to come in two weeks.

2063
02:49:04,850 --> 02:49:06,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Now just think, what's going to happen here in two weeks?

2064
02:49:06,691 --> 02:49:07,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody know?

2065
02:49:08,632 --> 02:49:09,833
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have a carnival, aren't we?

2066
02:49:10,494 --> 02:49:14,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And the carnival is going to be taking up all the parking spaces here at City Hall.

2067
02:49:15,057 --> 02:49:24,705
[SPEAKER_08]: So all these wonderful people who are going to bring their kids and think they're going to go to a carnival and not worry about the parking are going to go park in that parking lot over there with those stupid, stupid little

2068
02:49:25,152 --> 02:49:31,315
[SPEAKER_08]: kiosks or against the building for which nobody can see at the end of the day, and the tickets are going to be galore.

2069
02:49:31,355 --> 02:49:35,057
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you're going to really see, you're really going to see the people getting upset about that.

2070
02:49:35,658 --> 02:49:45,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And the police department, because they're not going to want to handle it because it's not in their bailiwick, because that's what they agreed upon by a union vote, not to be involved, to get involved, but anything to do with the ticketing.

2071
02:49:46,404 --> 02:49:54,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately for this chief of police, for which this wonderful mayor has saddled him with the responsibility of resolving all these problems.

2072
02:49:54,461 --> 02:49:58,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, as I said before, and I said to the chief, unfortunately, this is not your job.

2073
02:49:58,803 --> 02:50:01,165
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be doing police work, not parking work.

2074
02:50:01,425 --> 02:50:02,966
[SPEAKER_08]: The parking work should be done by the mayor.

2075
02:50:03,546 --> 02:50:12,571
[SPEAKER_08]: And to have him indicate and say that he's never received a complaint, he's absolutely, I don't know what he's drinking or smoking, but he's on something, whatever it might be.

2076
02:50:13,131 --> 02:50:20,355
[SPEAKER_08]: We heard a lady here come up here tonight and tell you from her beauty parlor that she not only wrote him, but she called him.

2077
02:50:20,705 --> 02:50:28,827
[SPEAKER_08]: We had last week, and I have the letter here, from Mystic Valley, the thing for pediatrics.

2078
02:50:29,127 --> 02:50:39,830
[SPEAKER_08]: We got the doctor, we got the employees, and we have people who are seniors who were there, gave the names of the individuals who didn't even know how to use, never mind the kiosk, but getting tagged.

2079
02:50:40,190 --> 02:50:45,391
[SPEAKER_08]: People who have handicapped placards getting tagged.

2080
02:50:46,301 --> 02:50:57,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I spoke to a lady that went to Here's Karen in West Medford during the second storm, the third storm, excuse me, an elderly woman whose daughter was driving her to Here's Karen.

2081
02:50:57,710 --> 02:51:05,476
[SPEAKER_08]: She gets getting out of the car and the Republic guy comes up to her, tells her to hurry up and move the car or you're going to get a ticket while the lady's walking into the store.

2082
02:51:06,277 --> 02:51:08,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that's not what you call good business.

2083
02:51:09,699 --> 02:51:14,123
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when you go in all the parking lots, the signs that say two hour parking is still up,

2084
02:51:14,749 --> 02:51:16,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're still giving out tickets.

2085
02:51:16,410 --> 02:51:18,070
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be three-hour parking.

2086
02:51:19,091 --> 02:51:22,672
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're right back to where we went right from the beginning.

2087
02:51:22,692 --> 02:51:24,233
[SPEAKER_08]: The contract was signed October 10.

2088
02:51:25,193 --> 02:51:33,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even think there's been any human relations interaction between any of these people that work for National Republic and the city of Medford.

2089
02:51:33,776 --> 02:51:35,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, pardon me?

2090
02:51:36,615 --> 02:51:37,335
[SPEAKER_08]: They're ambassadors.

2091
02:51:37,375 --> 02:51:40,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what they're, yeah, you know, they're ambassadors for bounty hunters.

2092
02:51:40,876 --> 02:51:41,577
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they are.

2093
02:51:41,597 --> 02:51:52,781
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Madam President, I just really think, and I know we're going to have a meeting on the, I think it's the 23rd, but the contract, the violations just keep continuing.

2094
02:51:53,081 --> 02:51:54,141
[SPEAKER_08]: The pictures don't lie.

2095
02:51:54,721 --> 02:51:59,783
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think today, I think we all got, or at least I got an email from folks on Frederick Avenue.

2096
02:52:00,342 --> 02:52:04,086
[SPEAKER_08]: who have legitimate parking permits to be parked there.

2097
02:52:04,626 --> 02:52:06,228
[SPEAKER_08]: They got tagged yesterday and today.

2098
02:52:06,588 --> 02:52:09,051
[SPEAKER_08]: So where does this begin and where does this begin and end?

2099
02:52:09,811 --> 02:52:15,677
[SPEAKER_08]: It's obvious the republic doesn't know their job or the people that are working for them don't know the territory of their job.

2100
02:52:16,198 --> 02:52:17,819
[SPEAKER_08]: They're giving out tickets indiscriminately.

2101
02:52:17,880 --> 02:52:20,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week, I believe the chief had to go up to Boston Avenue.

2102
02:52:20,669 --> 02:52:34,036
[SPEAKER_08]: and resolve tickets for business people up there who are legitimately parked in a 30-minute parking zone, in a loading zone, delivering, making a delivery, and emptying stuff out of their car.

2103
02:52:34,957 --> 02:52:37,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And the response from the Republic, if you don't like it, appeal it.

2104
02:52:38,018 --> 02:52:39,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's not the way it's supposed to be.

2105
02:52:39,979 --> 02:52:41,220
[SPEAKER_08]: They should go and do their job.

2106
02:52:42,281 --> 02:52:48,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, I would hope when the Chief comes in two weeks, and the Traffic Commission comes in two weeks,

2107
02:52:48,625 --> 02:52:50,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Nash, and whoever he wants to come from in two weeks.

2108
02:52:52,227 --> 02:52:54,448
[SPEAKER_08]: It's obvious, all these things need to get resolved.

2109
02:52:54,768 --> 02:52:59,251
[SPEAKER_08]: But Councilor Marks, you came up with a good idea, I think it was a couple of weeks ago, or maybe it was last week.

2110
02:52:59,691 --> 02:53:05,734
[SPEAKER_08]: For those people who have paid, let's find out how great this electronic system is that they have.

2111
02:53:06,314 --> 02:53:14,599
[SPEAKER_08]: If I paid before eight, and I paid after six, they should have a listing of all of that, because my number plate was supposed to be tied into that system.

2112
02:53:14,979 --> 02:53:16,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we all remember correctly,

2113
02:53:16,877 --> 02:53:19,017
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I do, because the records will reflect.

2114
02:53:19,417 --> 02:53:25,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that they said that they keep the records in that machine either for six weeks, if not eight weeks, okay?

2115
02:53:25,619 --> 02:53:26,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they keep them in there, pardon me?

2116
02:53:28,079 --> 02:53:31,060
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they don't purge them, they keep them for six, they have to keep them for the appeal period.

2117
02:53:31,280 --> 02:53:32,720
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to keep them for at least the appeal period.

2118
02:53:32,740 --> 02:53:35,340
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it, yeah, the tickets, okay, in the system.

2119
02:53:35,380 --> 02:53:43,382
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I think there should be no reason not to find out, Councilor Marks, there should be no reason not to find out how many people

2120
02:53:43,778 --> 02:53:45,298
[SPEAKER_08]: and how much money that they took.

2121
02:53:45,498 --> 02:53:51,079
[SPEAKER_08]: That's illegally, they illegally, that's, you know, that's a meat of robbery, if that's what you want to call it, okay?

2122
02:53:51,359 --> 02:53:52,600
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's perpetrating a fraud.

2123
02:53:52,640 --> 02:53:53,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know who's getting rich out of this?

2124
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:59,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only that, the mayor, he's making money on this because it goes to the end of the bottom line.

2125
02:53:59,341 --> 02:54:00,101
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not right.

2126
02:54:00,701 --> 02:54:06,082
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bad enough you're taxing the people to death, and now you have this new McGlynn tax that's every single day.

2127
02:54:06,622 --> 02:54:08,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't take money that shouldn't be taken.

2128
02:54:12,445 --> 02:54:20,168
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, Madam President, I received several emails just recently and over the last several weeks regarding resident permit parking.

2129
02:54:20,688 --> 02:54:26,791
[SPEAKER_22]: There's still an issue with residents that have a permit parking sticker receiving tickets.

2130
02:54:28,171 --> 02:54:31,893
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was brought up over in West Medford on Bauer in that area.

2131
02:54:32,313 --> 02:54:40,376
[SPEAKER_22]: And I received another email, actually two emails just recently about residents that are receiving tickets with permit parking stickers.

2132
02:54:41,066 --> 02:54:42,327
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure what's going on.

2133
02:54:42,387 --> 02:54:44,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Several weeks ago, we asked them to look into the system.

2134
02:54:45,468 --> 02:54:48,769
[SPEAKER_22]: We were told that there was a glitch with Republic.

2135
02:54:49,469 --> 02:54:55,552
[SPEAKER_22]: And for some reason, they were unable for a period of time to identify who had permit stickers and who didn't have them.

2136
02:54:56,252 --> 02:54:57,672
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was supposedly resolved.

2137
02:54:58,053 --> 02:55:02,114
[SPEAKER_22]: And now I'm getting more emails today with residents that are still getting tickets.

2138
02:55:02,854 --> 02:55:09,277
[SPEAKER_22]: And they're being told that they have to go up to the Republic office, which is a giant inconvenience.

2139
02:55:10,373 --> 02:55:13,435
[SPEAKER_22]: with something that, by no fault of their own.

2140
02:55:13,955 --> 02:55:16,377
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, I can't wait for this meeting, too.

2141
02:55:16,737 --> 02:55:19,078
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't wait to get the finances on this program.

2142
02:55:19,458 --> 02:55:25,882
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't wait to find out some of the questions that we've asked regarding this program.

2143
02:55:26,602 --> 02:55:38,088
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, it may come to some point, and I'm starting to agree with Councilor Penter on this, that we may be looking, I think, to maybe take in-house some aspects of this program.

2144
02:55:38,842 --> 02:55:41,383
[SPEAKER_22]: And in my opinion, the enforcement would be number one.

2145
02:55:41,884 --> 02:55:44,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Take that in, get our own in-house people to start the enforcement.

2146
02:55:45,165 --> 02:55:50,628
[SPEAKER_22]: We can use their equipment and, you know, we can keep a lot of the program in place.

2147
02:55:51,188 --> 02:55:58,191
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think many of the issues that I'm hearing comes with enforcement, the aggressive enforcement in nature.

2148
02:55:58,592 --> 02:56:01,773
[SPEAKER_22]: We were sold a bill of goods that, oh, they're not going to be aggressive.

2149
02:56:02,113 --> 02:56:05,295
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not going to be like Somerville hiding behind bushes and so forth.

2150
02:56:06,015 --> 02:56:07,636
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, there's going to be a grace period.

2151
02:56:08,110 --> 02:56:14,775
[SPEAKER_22]: And now we heard Councilor Caraviello last week saying the guy was standing behind his car when he had three or four minutes left on the meter.

2152
02:56:15,015 --> 02:56:21,780
[SPEAKER_22]: He came out of the store and the guy had his handheld device there waiting to give him a ticket with his plate already written in.

2153
02:56:23,261 --> 02:56:28,865
[SPEAKER_22]: So we went from, oh no, they're not going to be aggressive to standing behind someone's car waiting for the minutes to tick off.

2154
02:56:29,443 --> 02:56:32,604
[SPEAKER_22]: So the residents can be the judge of this program.

2155
02:56:32,984 --> 02:56:39,726
[SPEAKER_22]: And no matter what the mayor sold as a bill of goods, ultimately what happens is they're driven by money.

2156
02:56:40,126 --> 02:56:43,186
[SPEAKER_22]: This outside private company is driven by money.

2157
02:56:43,546 --> 02:56:46,047
[SPEAKER_22]: And naturally, they're going to be aggressive to try to bring in money.

2158
02:56:46,547 --> 02:56:51,348
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's going to be at the detriment of the business owners and also the residents of this community.

2159
02:56:51,368 --> 02:56:53,329
[SPEAKER_23]: Name and address of the record.

2160
02:56:53,349 --> 02:56:53,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

2161
02:56:54,349 --> 02:56:55,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street.

2162
02:56:56,950 --> 02:56:57,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Two points.

2163
02:56:58,833 --> 02:57:11,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with the bounty hunter aspect of it, because today, as I was enjoying a cup of coffee, I watched one of the enforcement agents there.

2164
02:57:13,078 --> 02:57:13,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Ambassador, I'm sorry.

2165
02:57:14,638 --> 02:57:15,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Ambassador.

2166
02:57:15,858 --> 02:57:22,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And he went to this truck, which his friend of mine was having coffee with me, and he had like 10 minutes there.

2167
02:57:23,461 --> 02:57:24,241
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy walked by.

2168
02:57:24,301 --> 02:57:27,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he came back, and he was hovering around the car, and he kept doing this.

2169
02:57:28,645 --> 02:57:32,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept doing this, so with about two minutes left, we had to write down some signs.

2170
02:57:32,286 --> 02:57:32,826
[SPEAKER_03]: He went over there.

2171
02:57:33,046 --> 02:57:38,288
[SPEAKER_03]: This gentleman was waiting for this thing to expire because he figured, well, it's like seven minutes left.

2172
02:57:38,308 --> 02:57:39,869
[SPEAKER_03]: He's definitely not going to make it.

2173
02:57:41,149 --> 02:57:42,729
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's been happening, okay?

2174
02:57:43,310 --> 02:57:52,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel bad for the people that are up in the office of Republic because they're only the messengers and they're taking a lot of the grief, the citizens who have the jobs there.

2175
02:57:52,333 --> 02:57:56,774
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem I have is that we've had a reduction in enforcement because

2176
02:57:57,272 --> 02:58:02,595
[SPEAKER_03]: When people went to get their stickers for permit parking, they got no stickers.

2177
02:58:03,036 --> 02:58:09,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So now what happens is we have an influx of cars coming in there after the enforcement is over and on the weekends.

2178
02:58:10,220 --> 02:58:18,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you call the police, the police say, we don't know who has a sticker and who doesn't, because they don't have the software, they don't have the wherewithal to do it.

2179
02:58:19,106 --> 02:58:19,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's important.

2180
02:58:20,367 --> 02:58:22,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I called up Republic, they said, well, we're working on it.

2181
02:58:23,749 --> 02:58:25,250
[SPEAKER_03]: But I asked a simple question.

2182
02:58:25,270 --> 02:58:27,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, well, why did you change the scheme?

2183
02:58:27,795 --> 02:58:28,815
[SPEAKER_03]: from giving out the stickers.

2184
02:58:28,855 --> 02:58:29,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, everybody does that.

2185
02:58:30,336 --> 02:58:31,636
[SPEAKER_03]: You put a sticker there.

2186
02:58:32,317 --> 02:58:34,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she didn't have an answer because she's not in the corporate end of things.

2187
02:58:34,918 --> 02:58:39,059
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that when these people come, we have the meeting, that we get this answer.

2188
02:58:39,079 --> 02:58:41,180
[SPEAKER_23]: They're going back to stickers.

2189
02:58:41,300 --> 02:58:41,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

2190
02:58:41,740 --> 02:58:45,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, who's going to be responsible for the payment of those stickers and for the cost of the stickers?

2191
02:58:45,841 --> 02:58:46,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And how will they do it?

2192
02:58:46,862 --> 02:58:53,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if everybody has their placards and they're in the book already, that way they're going to get them to all the people.

2193
02:58:54,064 --> 02:58:54,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And who's going to pay for that?

2194
02:58:56,822 --> 02:59:00,385
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have visitor passes, okay?

2195
02:59:01,465 --> 02:59:10,992
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, I understand that, but you went for the permit, you have the permit, and you don't have the decal, but you have two placards for visitor passes.

2196
02:59:11,292 --> 02:59:13,814
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they going to get the decals for the people who bought?

2197
02:59:13,834 --> 02:59:15,475
[SPEAKER_23]: They're going to have to issue them.

2198
02:59:15,495 --> 02:59:17,816
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, they're going to have to issue at their expense, I would assume.

2199
02:59:17,836 --> 02:59:19,237
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll find that out in the 22nd.

2200
02:59:19,778 --> 02:59:22,920
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll ask that question and try to make sure that the resident doesn't have to pay.

2201
02:59:22,940 --> 02:59:23,460
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2202
02:59:23,640 --> 02:59:26,002
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of other issues there.

2203
02:59:26,456 --> 02:59:32,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll wait until this meeting comes up, but I just wanted to say that there's a net, the net results so far on the permit parking is negative.

2204
02:59:32,978 --> 02:59:43,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not getting the enforcement and we're getting more people from Somerville parking on the side streets where there's permit parking because there's no enforcement and you can't blame the police because they don't know, they don't have the information, you know?

2205
02:59:44,060 --> 02:59:44,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

2206
02:59:45,101 --> 02:59:45,461
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

2207
02:59:46,641 --> 02:59:47,501
[SPEAKER_23]: Name and address of the record.

2208
02:59:48,461 --> 02:59:50,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

2209
02:59:50,322 --> 02:59:55,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Before this was instituted, I wrote to the council and gave you articles about

2210
02:59:56,088 --> 02:59:59,929
[SPEAKER_06]: different cities and towns around America where Republic was reviled.

2211
03:00:00,249 --> 03:00:01,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Legitimate news media.

2212
03:00:02,030 --> 03:00:03,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Legitimate news media.

2213
03:00:04,631 --> 03:00:10,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happened along with the people being upset?

2214
03:00:10,673 --> 03:00:13,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Within Republic, there were discrimination suits.

2215
03:00:13,994 --> 03:00:15,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So this company was bad to begin with.

2216
03:00:15,654 --> 03:00:16,374
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor knew this.

2217
03:00:17,215 --> 03:00:17,515
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2218
03:00:17,835 --> 03:00:20,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to quote Al Pacino in The Devil's Advocate.

2219
03:00:20,196 --> 03:00:22,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun to be right, but it's not fun to be right in this.

2220
03:00:22,656 --> 03:00:24,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I told this council about

2221
03:00:25,137 --> 03:00:27,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Problems with Republic before it was installed?

2222
03:00:27,158 --> 03:00:28,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked about the Cable TV Commission.

2223
03:00:29,560 --> 03:00:30,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not psychic.

2224
03:00:30,620 --> 03:00:32,862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just obvious this mayor is not taking care of things.

2225
03:00:32,902 --> 03:00:40,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, two different people came to me and said that they had had problems right over the end of the credit union and Salvatore's.

2226
03:00:42,328 --> 03:00:45,910
[SPEAKER_06]: One business person was at Salvatore's two hours.

2227
03:00:46,895 --> 03:00:49,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven minutes left, got hit with a ticket, was irate.

2228
03:00:51,077 --> 03:00:57,399
[SPEAKER_06]: The delivery guy for the credit union was like a few inches over the white line, got hit with a $100 fine.

2229
03:00:58,460 --> 03:00:59,820
[SPEAKER_06]: The credit union is up in arms.

2230
03:01:00,241 --> 03:01:02,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I will leave it to them, to the people there.

2231
03:01:03,122 --> 03:01:05,843
[SPEAKER_06]: But they supposedly contacted the mayor.

2232
03:01:05,863 --> 03:01:07,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave them the mayor's phone number.

2233
03:01:07,483 --> 03:01:11,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And the person that I know there said that a lot of people were going to call the mayor.

2234
03:01:11,985 --> 03:01:13,786
[SPEAKER_06]: We hear that the mayor hasn't got one phone call.

2235
03:01:15,667 --> 03:01:15,947
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

2236
03:01:16,843 --> 03:01:18,564
[SPEAKER_23]: So you've resolved, Councilor Penta.

2237
03:01:19,025 --> 03:01:23,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick, Rick, I'm going to go back to December 23rd of this past year.

2238
03:01:23,728 --> 03:01:27,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Your resolution, the mayor hasn't even acknowledged it, and you even gave him a grace period.

2239
03:01:27,150 --> 03:01:40,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Your resolution, as it relates to 14-795, basically says, and that we had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we had almost 11 people speak that night, amended by Councilor Caraviello, that a 60-day evaluation take place with the mayor and republic with the council.

2240
03:01:41,060 --> 03:01:45,423
[SPEAKER_08]: And we gave the grace period to begin when it became operative in January 15th, okay?

2241
03:01:46,009 --> 03:01:47,150
[SPEAKER_08]: This is now April 7th.

2242
03:01:47,730 --> 03:01:50,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Never mind not having any meeting, we've got no financials.

2243
03:01:50,672 --> 03:01:53,773
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what I would like to do in preparation for our meeting.

2244
03:01:53,813 --> 03:02:11,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we haven't had our 60-day meeting, I would like to amend and have the council go on record that effective immediately that we meet with the council every 30 days for the purposes of going over its finances and all the complaints and the concerns that we have until this thing gets itself resolved.

2245
03:02:11,923 --> 03:02:14,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're going to be meeting with the traffic commission,

2246
03:02:15,118 --> 03:02:16,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just going to be a one-shot deal.

2247
03:02:17,379 --> 03:02:24,944
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we can't get them to give us a response after 60 days, and if we follow what you're saying, Councilor Marks, and we now go 30 days after that, forget it.

2248
03:02:25,224 --> 03:02:29,987
[SPEAKER_08]: How much more time do you want to give them to get their act together?

2249
03:02:30,227 --> 03:02:31,388
[SPEAKER_23]: We're meeting on the 22nd.

2250
03:02:31,748 --> 03:02:32,709
[SPEAKER_08]: The 23rd, Wednesday.

2251
03:02:32,729 --> 03:02:36,711
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, let's see where we go with that meeting before we make any other decisions.

2252
03:02:36,731 --> 03:02:37,251
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I agree.

2253
03:02:38,092 --> 03:02:40,273
[SPEAKER_23]: So what do we have first resolved?

2254
03:02:41,174 --> 03:02:43,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to have this resolved before we did once again

2255
03:02:43,803 --> 03:02:46,924
[SPEAKER_08]: to the concerns that were going to take place on the meeting of the 23rd.

2256
03:02:48,365 --> 03:02:54,408
[SPEAKER_23]: So this paper will be forwarded to the meeting we're going to have on Wednesday, April 22nd, I believe it is.

2257
03:02:54,488 --> 03:02:57,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it the 23rd or the 22nd, Eddie?

2258
03:02:58,209 --> 03:02:58,289
[SPEAKER_23]: 22nd.

2259
03:02:58,549 --> 03:02:58,669
[SPEAKER_08]: 22nd.

2260
03:02:59,050 --> 03:02:59,850
[SPEAKER_23]: 22nd, it's a Wednesday.

2261
03:02:59,870 --> 03:03:05,432
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're going to refer this to the committee meeting.

2262
03:03:06,833 --> 03:03:07,513
[SPEAKER_23]: All those in favor?

2263
03:03:08,133 --> 03:03:09,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Just before we do that, Madam President,

2264
03:03:10,155 --> 03:03:18,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, with all these pictures that are there, and the chief knows about it, he's aware about it, he's instructed Republic on more than one occasion to do it, and they haven't done it.

2265
03:03:19,158 --> 03:03:23,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And once again, I'm just publicly saying to the chief and any police officer out there, you see these cars, tag them.

2266
03:03:24,139 --> 03:03:24,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Tag them and tow them.

2267
03:03:25,060 --> 03:03:25,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Get them off the road.

2268
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:26,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know something?

2269
03:03:27,040 --> 03:03:34,742
[SPEAKER_08]: If a poor guy drives down the street and he doesn't have a sticker on his windshield because he wasn't inspected, that's a $50 fine, and he has the right to have his car impounded.

2270
03:03:34,782 --> 03:03:36,663
[SPEAKER_08]: The same thing without having a registration.

2271
03:03:36,965 --> 03:03:38,865
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys have been around since January.

2272
03:03:39,065 --> 03:03:47,227
[SPEAKER_08]: And from January till now, they still haven't gotten their act together, especially with their vehicles that they go out and they try to enforce the rules that they can't even have it.

2273
03:03:47,387 --> 03:03:51,068
[SPEAKER_08]: They try to enforce rules that they won't obey, but they want other people to obey.

2274
03:03:51,108 --> 03:03:52,529
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not right, Madam President.

2275
03:03:52,749 --> 03:03:55,609
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what happens when you go out of town and you get out-of-towners.

2276
03:03:55,849 --> 03:04:03,331
[SPEAKER_08]: And these people are bounty hunters, and they probably have quotas, and they're going to do everything they can now to make life miserable, to make up for what they lost during the storms.

2277
03:04:04,313 --> 03:04:06,494
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're going to refer this to the committee meeting.

2278
03:04:06,514 --> 03:04:07,594
[SPEAKER_23]: We can discuss it further.

2279
03:04:07,914 --> 03:04:08,615
[SPEAKER_23]: All those in favor?

2280
03:04:09,315 --> 03:04:10,015
[SPEAKER_23]: All those opposed?

2281
03:04:11,856 --> 03:04:13,617
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Camuso.

2282
03:04:14,717 --> 03:04:17,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly what are you saying they should be ticketed and towed for?

2283
03:04:18,498 --> 03:04:20,039
[SPEAKER_23]: We're referring this paper to committee.

2284
03:04:20,199 --> 03:04:20,479
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

2285
03:04:20,499 --> 03:04:27,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to ask the councilor exactly what, I mean, if it's just a sign on the back, the police can't ticket or tow them.

2286
03:04:29,407 --> 03:04:30,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, are they not inspected?

2287
03:04:30,947 --> 03:04:33,788
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a violation of the contract.

2288
03:04:34,008 --> 03:04:35,769
[SPEAKER_08]: They've done it since January.

2289
03:04:35,869 --> 03:04:36,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

2290
03:04:36,469 --> 03:04:41,311
[SPEAKER_08]: But my question is, the police aren't the enforcing authority on city contracts.

2291
03:04:41,331 --> 03:04:50,974
[SPEAKER_08]: The Registry of Motor Vehicles has a site and section that says if you make frequent stops, you have to have that on the back of your vehicle that says

2292
03:04:51,452 --> 03:04:52,792
[SPEAKER_08]: This vehicle makes frequent stops.

2293
03:04:52,812 --> 03:04:53,293
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my question.

2294
03:04:53,313 --> 03:04:54,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have not done that.

2295
03:04:54,433 --> 03:04:54,473
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

2296
03:04:54,733 --> 03:04:56,673
[SPEAKER_08]: All they have is those stupid flashing yellow lights.

2297
03:04:56,974 --> 03:04:57,174
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2298
03:04:57,254 --> 03:04:57,914
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my question.

2299
03:04:57,954 --> 03:05:02,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know what was actually wrong with the vehicles, because I still haven't seen them, to be honest with you.

2300
03:05:02,575 --> 03:05:04,076
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to see them if you don't have them.

2301
03:05:04,096 --> 03:05:05,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I see the pictures every week.

2302
03:05:05,336 --> 03:05:05,996
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2303
03:05:06,436 --> 03:05:06,696
[SPEAKER_23]: You got it.

2304
03:05:07,016 --> 03:05:07,416
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks.

2305
03:05:08,257 --> 03:05:13,118
[SPEAKER_23]: Motion for approval to send this to our committee meeting, which is going to be held on the 22nd of April.

2306
03:05:13,238 --> 03:05:13,878
[SPEAKER_23]: All those in favor?

2307
03:05:14,178 --> 03:05:14,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

2308
03:05:14,458 --> 03:05:15,019
[SPEAKER_23]: All those opposed?

2309
03:05:15,039 --> 03:05:16,199
[SPEAKER_23]: Paper carries.

2310
03:05:16,239 --> 03:05:20,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, can we allow suspension of the rules to allow a citizen to speak?

2311
03:05:22,723 --> 03:05:40,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record.

2312
03:05:40,886 --> 03:05:43,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

2313
03:05:43,347 --> 03:05:44,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

2314
03:05:45,147 --> 03:05:49,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Just an update on the contract and public access TV.

2315
03:05:49,802 --> 03:05:51,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Today I met with Solicitor Rumley.

2316
03:05:52,004 --> 03:05:59,009
[SPEAKER_06]: He said he would alert me immediately if he hears something on a public hearing on Comcast, which I want this council to be aware.

2317
03:05:59,389 --> 03:06:02,091
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be, gee, one of the city councilors is missing.

2318
03:06:02,111 --> 03:06:06,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I speak, instead of taking care of city business, the guy just vanishes.

2319
03:06:07,235 --> 03:06:08,015
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not proper.

2320
03:06:08,075 --> 03:06:08,696
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not correct.

2321
03:06:09,556 --> 03:06:16,541
[SPEAKER_06]: The April 18th is the time Tim Kelly at Comcast wanted the mayor to respond on a Saturday.

2322
03:06:16,882 --> 03:06:17,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get this.

2323
03:06:17,983 --> 03:06:19,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And the 20th is the deadline.

2324
03:06:19,644 --> 03:06:23,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Solicitor Rumley told me he would e-mail me immediately if he hears.

2325
03:06:23,786 --> 03:06:25,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, Peter Epstein is handling this.

2326
03:06:26,388 --> 03:06:27,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's Peter Epstein.

2327
03:06:28,589 --> 03:06:33,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I also met with Senator Jalen today, and I met with her chief of staff as well, Tim Snyder.

2328
03:06:34,433 --> 03:06:38,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have alerted them to this contract Comcast, which I don't think they were aware of.

2329
03:06:38,255 --> 03:06:39,415
[SPEAKER_06]: They looked very disappointed.

2330
03:06:40,816 --> 03:06:42,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked the senator to please help us.

2331
03:06:42,497 --> 03:06:44,058
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been in touch about this issue.

2332
03:06:44,959 --> 03:06:47,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim Snyder and I have been in touch about this issue.

2333
03:06:47,875 --> 03:06:54,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I've also been in touch with Christine Barber by email about this issue.

2334
03:06:54,199 --> 03:06:58,923
[SPEAKER_06]: So everyone, Rep Donato, Sean Garbali, everyone's aware of this issue.

2335
03:06:59,383 --> 03:07:00,404
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very, very important.

2336
03:07:01,825 --> 03:07:08,910
[SPEAKER_06]: We have no access TV, and we're not getting any answers from the mayor on this situation.

2337
03:07:09,310 --> 03:07:15,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I did talk to an expert about these things, and the expert said within 40 miles of the Medford area,

2338
03:07:15,642 --> 03:07:18,603
[SPEAKER_06]: There are probably four or five cities or towns who are tenants at will.

2339
03:07:19,103 --> 03:07:21,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how legal that is, so I'm looking into that.

2340
03:07:22,383 --> 03:07:24,004
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the update.

2341
03:07:24,924 --> 03:07:26,804
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

2342
03:07:26,924 --> 03:07:33,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Their contracts expired with their cable providers, and they just let the cable providers stay there with no contract.

2343
03:07:33,306 --> 03:07:44,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, four or five cities or towns I was advised, if I looked around, and the person told me within a 40-mile radius, so this person knows his business, that's fascinating, and that's something we should know about, that we're going to hold

2344
03:07:45,990 --> 03:07:48,290
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor, we're going to hold his feet to the fire on this one.

2345
03:07:49,231 --> 03:07:49,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

2346
03:07:50,051 --> 03:07:59,193
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could also get an update on the cable to find out when the new, it's not so new anymore, Verizon Fios contract is up for renewal as well.

2347
03:07:59,213 --> 03:08:01,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I thought that they were up around the same time.

2348
03:08:02,893 --> 03:08:08,274
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I know they came in after the fact, but I thought that they staggered it so that they would be renewed around the same time.

2349
03:08:08,314 --> 03:08:09,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I had thought that, but.

2350
03:08:11,475 --> 03:08:11,975
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Penta.

2351
03:08:12,860 --> 03:08:36,493
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things I think it's kind of like really enlightening to read is the action that's taking place against the city of Lynn where the prosecution really, the prosecutorial process has really gone in depth as it relates to the finances that took place in the city of Lynn that were just not being justified and accountable for.

2352
03:08:36,513 --> 03:08:39,555
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have been asking for a long period of time over here

2353
03:08:40,748 --> 03:08:58,485
[SPEAKER_08]: the former people that worked for Channel 3 to submit their finances, and it started back at Mark Rumley, when they call it the Rumley Report, and then when we had Judge Thompson, and now we're here, and nothing's taking place, you know, and the mayor owes it.

2354
03:08:58,685 --> 03:08:59,566
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor owes it.

2355
03:08:59,852 --> 03:09:01,153
[SPEAKER_08]: to every single TV subscriber.

2356
03:09:01,173 --> 03:09:02,253
[SPEAKER_08]: He owes it to this council.

2357
03:09:02,273 --> 03:09:03,253
[SPEAKER_08]: We keep talking about it.

2358
03:09:03,754 --> 03:09:08,775
[SPEAKER_08]: He's sitting on $300,000 of subscribers' monies with absolutely no accounting.

2359
03:09:09,376 --> 03:09:11,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is what precipitated the lawsuit in Lynn.

2360
03:09:12,397 --> 03:09:15,678
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is how they're all getting sued individually for whatever it might be worth.

2361
03:09:16,358 --> 03:09:25,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Lynn is one of eight communities that, unfortunately, the public access channels just apparently ran amok because nobody was watching over them.

2362
03:09:25,802 --> 03:09:27,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like this city here, nobody watching over them.

2363
03:09:28,603 --> 03:09:41,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And when the voluntary dissolution supposedly took place, I think it was October of 2013 to now, and they said that they were going to submit all these papers, and the Attorney General blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and is just out there in limbo.

2364
03:09:42,071 --> 03:09:44,772
[SPEAKER_08]: But this new Attorney General, Mara Healy, she must mean action.

2365
03:09:46,592 --> 03:09:51,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, big difference for Martha Coakley, because this one here at least does something whether you like it or you don't.

2366
03:09:51,114 --> 03:09:53,075
[SPEAKER_08]: She gets back to you and she responds.

2367
03:09:53,815 --> 03:10:11,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And their in-depth action against the Lynne Cable television should be the groundwork already being done for the city of Medford just to copy the same thing and go after these culprits who just not has done what they're supposed to have done as it relates to, you know, providing the information, the minutes, the finances, you know, the equipment.

2368
03:10:12,664 --> 03:10:14,125
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's just outrageous.

2369
03:10:14,225 --> 03:10:14,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the mayor,

2370
03:10:15,738 --> 03:10:30,547
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the man not to have this public hearing, for which is required by just common sense, I mean, just for transparency, even if you don't want to even do anything but have it and let the people come and talk, what is he afraid of?

2371
03:10:30,567 --> 03:10:32,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand this man.

2372
03:10:32,309 --> 03:10:34,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't understand it.

2373
03:10:35,270 --> 03:10:37,712
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't like the council because he doesn't respond to us.

2374
03:10:38,292 --> 03:10:42,335
[SPEAKER_08]: He tolerates the school committee because he has to go every other Monday when he has to go.

2375
03:10:43,216 --> 03:10:45,037
[SPEAKER_08]: He never responds to our resolutions.

2376
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:47,821
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not leadership that works anymore.

2377
03:10:48,081 --> 03:10:51,884
[SPEAKER_08]: It might have worked in the beginning for him, but it's absolutely out of control.

2378
03:10:52,404 --> 03:10:53,085
[SPEAKER_08]: It's lazy.

2379
03:10:53,165 --> 03:10:54,045
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone asleep.

2380
03:10:54,166 --> 03:10:54,846
[SPEAKER_08]: It's broken.

2381
03:10:55,266 --> 03:11:00,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think he's probably thinking about, you know, maybe these bounty hunters have a better job than him.

2382
03:11:00,710 --> 03:11:03,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And who knows, maybe he's going to go join a company like that.

2383
03:11:03,712 --> 03:11:08,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea, but this, this is absolutely not working.

2384
03:11:09,696 --> 03:11:15,120
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Camuso's resolve that we get an update with regards to when the FIOS contract is up.

2385
03:11:16,063 --> 03:11:40,237
[SPEAKER_08]: do you want to ask also in that FIOS contract the finances as it relates to it how much we get each quarter and you know how does that work into the whole program no no where are those monies that they come together with Comcast and FIOS you know we can find those resolve motion all those in favor all right all those opposed passes

2386
03:11:43,025 --> 03:11:52,474
[SPEAKER_23]: Offered by Councilor Caraviello, 15-339, be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer its deepest condolences to the family of Joe Conway.

2387
03:11:53,135 --> 03:11:57,359
[SPEAKER_23]: Joe was an inspector for the city of Medford for many years before his recent passing.

2388
03:11:57,820 --> 03:12:00,102
[SPEAKER_23]: He will be missed by all his friends and family.

2389
03:12:01,323 --> 03:12:03,585
[SPEAKER_23]: While we're under suspension, Councilor,

2390
03:12:06,845 --> 03:12:19,173
[SPEAKER_23]: Also offered by Councilor Caraviello, 1-5-340, be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer its deepest condolences to the family of former Superintendent of Schools, Raymond Marano, on his recent passing.

2391
03:12:19,554 --> 03:12:21,775
[SPEAKER_23]: He will be missed by his many family and friends.

2392
03:12:23,176 --> 03:12:32,642
[SPEAKER_23]: Paper 1-5-341, offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer condolences to the family of Barbara Belcastro on her recent passing.

2393
03:12:34,825 --> 03:12:36,605
[SPEAKER_23]: by her friends and family.

2394
03:12:37,305 --> 03:12:38,146
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Caraviello.

2395
03:12:38,566 --> 03:12:39,666
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

2396
03:12:40,166 --> 03:12:46,827
[SPEAKER_24]: We lost two former city employees this weekend, both good people, a long time.

2397
03:12:47,987 --> 03:12:56,809
[SPEAKER_24]: And the last person, excuse me, her husband was a long time chairman of the veteran services.

2398
03:12:59,050 --> 03:13:01,190
[SPEAKER_24]: This weekend was a great loss for the city of Medford.

2399
03:13:01,988 --> 03:13:04,008
[SPEAKER_24]: dedicate this meeting in memory of those three.

2400
03:13:04,428 --> 03:13:05,449
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd appreciate it, Madam President.

2401
03:13:05,729 --> 03:13:07,289
[SPEAKER_23]: We all may rise for a moment of silence.

2402
03:13:08,609 --> 03:13:09,169
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Penta.

2403
03:13:09,949 --> 03:13:16,991
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone knew Joe Conway, you'd realize he was a consummate person that you would want to be a representative of this city.

2404
03:13:17,391 --> 03:13:18,111
[SPEAKER_08]: He always smiled.

2405
03:13:18,571 --> 03:13:19,411
[SPEAKER_08]: He was never rude.

2406
03:13:19,831 --> 03:13:20,511
[SPEAKER_08]: He was polite.

2407
03:13:20,871 --> 03:13:21,652
[SPEAKER_08]: He knew his job.

2408
03:13:22,092 --> 03:13:22,832
[SPEAKER_08]: He was friendly.

2409
03:13:22,992 --> 03:13:25,732
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, he did his job like he was supposed to.

2410
03:13:25,912 --> 03:13:29,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you needed a break, he would help you out, making sure that you did what you were supposed to do.

2411
03:13:30,627 --> 03:13:32,188
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I remember about Joe.

2412
03:13:32,628 --> 03:13:36,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Always had a smile on his face and was always willing to talk and help out people.

2413
03:13:37,109 --> 03:13:42,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I wish I could say that for everybody in this building, but at least we can say that about Joe.

2414
03:13:43,671 --> 03:13:44,491
[SPEAKER_23]: Moment of silence.

2415
03:13:53,214 --> 03:13:53,534
[SPEAKER_23]: Records.

2416
03:13:55,454 --> 03:13:56,695
[SPEAKER_23]: Records of the meeting were passed.

2417
03:13:58,225 --> 03:14:00,426
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Caraviello, have you reviewed the records?

2418
03:14:02,847 --> 03:14:15,713
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam President, in 15-323, at the end, the motion was passed by Councilor Camuso and Councilor Dela Cruz.

2419
03:14:15,733 --> 03:14:16,614
[SPEAKER_23]: So make that one change.

2420
03:14:16,694 --> 03:14:18,635
[SPEAKER_23]: Otherwise, you find them in order of approval?

2421
03:14:18,655 --> 03:14:18,715
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

2422
03:14:19,355 --> 03:14:20,035
[SPEAKER_23]: All those in favor?

2423
03:14:20,436 --> 03:14:20,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2424
03:14:20,756 --> 03:14:21,396
[SPEAKER_23]: All those opposed?

2425
03:14:22,597 --> 03:14:23,277
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Camuso?

2426
03:14:23,597 --> 03:14:24,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

2427
03:14:24,637 --> 03:14:25,678
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a receipt tonight

2428
03:14:26,197 --> 03:14:32,640
[SPEAKER_07]: of a letter in response to resolution 15-061 from Barbara Rubel at Tufts University.

2429
03:14:34,341 --> 03:14:39,703
[SPEAKER_07]: It's talking about the runoff water regarding the snow that they were dumping from their campus into the fields.

2430
03:14:42,504 --> 03:14:51,228
[SPEAKER_07]: As the neighbor stated, I think it's just as big of a concern as the, as I know residents were concerned where Medford was dumping the snow.

2431
03:14:51,908 --> 03:14:52,989
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got contaminants in it.

2432
03:14:53,369 --> 03:14:55,290
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of times oil and things of that nature.

2433
03:14:56,125 --> 03:15:10,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see anywhere in this letter that addresses if at all there was looked at for environmental issues, other than just saying there was sand underneath the field, a big layer of sand which helps the water drain.

2434
03:15:11,471 --> 03:15:21,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a bigger concern with not the water draining and creating maybe a little moisture down there, but any contaminants, the salt, oil that may be picked up and other stuff that's

2435
03:15:22,945 --> 03:15:26,207
[SPEAKER_07]: that's on the street surfaces that were plowed and then the snow was dumped.

2436
03:15:26,847 --> 03:15:35,131
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could just send this copy of this letter, Mr. Finn, up to our Board of Health, just to take a look at and see if in the future any other precautions should be taken.

2437
03:15:36,472 --> 03:15:46,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know in the past, I don't see any difference with this, as Councilor Penta brought up a few years ago, Meadow Glen Mall, remember when they were dumping all the snow from all their other properties, the snow farms?

2438
03:15:46,977 --> 03:15:50,099
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were concerned about the environmental hazards of that.

2439
03:15:50,159 --> 03:15:52,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So just to make sure that,

2440
03:15:53,174 --> 03:15:54,375
[SPEAKER_07]: It was monitored properly.

2441
03:15:54,435 --> 03:15:55,596
[SPEAKER_23]: Preventions for the future.

2442
03:15:55,897 --> 03:15:56,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And that too.

2443
03:15:57,438 --> 03:16:00,101
[SPEAKER_23]: Motion for approval by Councilor Camuso.

2444
03:16:00,181 --> 03:16:00,942
[SPEAKER_23]: All those in favor?

2445
03:16:01,202 --> 03:16:02,583
[SPEAKER_23]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

2446
03:16:02,643 --> 03:16:03,384
[SPEAKER_23]: All those in favor?

2447
03:16:03,684 --> 03:16:03,804
[SPEAKER_23]: Aye.

2448
03:16:04,085 --> 03:16:04,745
[SPEAKER_23]: All those opposed?

2449
03:16:05,526 --> 03:16:06,207
[SPEAKER_23]: Paper passes.

2450
03:16:08,169 --> 03:16:10,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor President Dello Russo.

2451
03:16:10,911 --> 03:16:11,592
[SPEAKER_23]: All those in favor?

2452
03:16:11,612 --> 03:16:13,113
[SPEAKER_23]: Happy Easter, everybody.

2453
03:16:13,474 --> 03:16:15,556
[SPEAKER_23]: I hope everybody had a wonderful Easter.

2454
03:16:15,856 --> 03:16:16,116
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.
