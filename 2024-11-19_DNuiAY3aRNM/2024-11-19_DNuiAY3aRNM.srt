[SPEAKER_10]: So which one was the purpose section?

00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:46,096

38
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,571
[SPEAKER_10]: This paper here is going on its first reading this evening.

39
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:04,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any questions?

40
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:05,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

41
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:15,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I just want to take an opportunity to recognize the work that this council has done on this ordinance.

42
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:19,638
[SPEAKER_08]: This came to us some time ago when there were some concerns over the composition thereof.

43
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:39,054
[SPEAKER_08]: document that was creating a commission that was comprised of mainly individuals that didn't have a reflection or an involvement with our public schools, with our local experts in public health coming out of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital Hallmark Health Area or Tufts University.

44
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:48,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And through a number of meetings, a number of hours of deliberation, discussion, and debate, we were able to come up with this document that I think is reflective of the needs

45
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,022
[SPEAKER_08]: of the behavioral health concerns in our community.

46
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:55,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to put us in a better place than we are today with this passage, and I support it wholeheartedly.

47
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:59,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd just like to take this opportunity to recognize the work of the council.

48
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:03,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we had over 10 meetings on this one document that's before us here this evening.

49
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want individuals to think that it's being rushed through.

50
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:12,619
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that we took a long and hard look at and took a long time vetting, and it's something that I support wholeheartedly.

51
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very grateful that we were able to get it completed, and I ask my council colleagues to support it this evening.

52
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:18,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

53
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:19,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

54
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:27,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, if I could, in line with Vice President Knight, I want to thank my council colleagues for their due diligence on this.

55
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:34,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to thank the acting city solicitor and the Board of Health Director for their input regarding this.

56
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:37,727
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Mr. President, in this day and age,

57
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:54,897
[SPEAKER_11]: in particular with a pandemic for the past year, health and behavioral health and wellness is now more vital than ever with mental illness and other issues of behavioral health, Mr. President, during this pandemic.

58
00:06:55,638 --> 00:07:06,705
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's very important to have a board of such that is comprised of police, fire, health officials, the Director of Veteran Services,

59
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:28,077
[SPEAKER_11]: It runs the gambit, Mr. President, local institutions such as Tufts University, LMH, that can get together and we can get the input from many different organizations that see mental health and the wellness and health in many different lights.

60
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:32,498
[SPEAKER_11]: in this community, and I think it's important to bring all that knowledge together.

61
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:52,542
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what this is going to accomplish, so we can have one, as it states, depository of information that gathers information from every aspect, whether it's a veteran in the community, someone that may be homeless, someone that's experiencing housing instability, whatever the case may be, mental illness.

62
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:59,291
[SPEAKER_11]: have a central depository where we can work on issues vital to residents of this community.

63
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:02,976
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank my colleagues for their due diligence on this.

64
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:04,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

65
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:07,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Diane Sullivan, name and address of the record, please.

66
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:12,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Caraviello, Diane Sullivan, West Medford.

67
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:19,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I too want to thank everybody who's been involved with forming this commission.

68
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:32,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a question through you, President Caraviello, because I was looking back at an iteration, an earlier iteration, where there would be two people with lived expertise who would be engaged.

69
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:37,119
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see now that it is now down to one person with lived expertise.

70
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:47,073
[SPEAKER_01]: The work that I do, the consulting that I do around how we engage people with lived experience, in whatever that might be, whether it's poverty, homelessness, hunger,

71
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:50,917
[SPEAKER_01]: the importance of the value that they bring to the table.

72
00:08:51,377 --> 00:09:00,504
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited, you know, that this commission is forming and I just hope, I see that in the plan on the first meeting, the goals for the year will be set.

73
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:07,110
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just hope that there can be some, you know, behind the scenes work that can really look to engage the community.

74
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:16,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there can be consideration to re-add that second person with lived expertise, I think it would really add value to the work that will be done.

75
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:23,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to further think about how those people with lived experience are supported in that role.

76
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:28,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes, people with lived expertise can step into the space.

77
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:33,698
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much knowledge to share, but there are power structures that can sometimes

78
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:41,745
[SPEAKER_01]: that play a role and the person may need some additional supports to really meaningfully and equitably engage.

79
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:43,286
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thank you.

80
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:51,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that these efforts are being put forth and I hope that, and I'm happy to support these efforts on

81
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:59,038
[SPEAKER_01]: engaging folks with lived expertise to make sure that they are a real and equitable part of the solutions.

82
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:06,702
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody plays their role, but nobody knows the struggles of dealing with behavioral health than those who go through that struggle.

83
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:07,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much.

84
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:09,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Diane.

85
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:10,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

86
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

87
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:18,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to address Diane's point, we worked long and hard to try to keep the number to a manageable number.

88
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:22,174
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree that lived experience is truly important.

89
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:30,821
[SPEAKER_11]: And under the representation, the mayor also has three appointments, which could be someone with lived experience.

90
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:36,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And also don't discount the fact that people that may be sitting on the board currently

91
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:40,031
[SPEAKER_11]: other capacities may also have lived experience as well.

92
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:46,722
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we can't judge based on someone's position or their status, they too may have lived experience as well.

93
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:48,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Monk.

94
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:49,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further questions?

95
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:50,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

96
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

97
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

98
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

99
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I also just wanted to thank my colleagues for all their hard work on this.

100
00:10:57,776 --> 00:11:06,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we worked on this for a long time, put in a lot of effort, and far too often behavioral health issues are overlooked just in general.

101
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:13,568
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that this is going to hopefully go a long way in looking at a lot of these issues.

102
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:15,828
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank my colleagues for all their hard work.

103
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:27,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this, this began a while back and we had a number of long, long meetings, but they were very, very good discussions about how to do this and how to do this right.

104
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:29,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to thank everyone for their involvement.

105
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:29,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

106
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:31,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

107
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:32,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Best.

108
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:34,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

109
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:40,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I again want to echo my colleagues and thank all of the councilors and city staff who

110
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:42,608
[SPEAKER_05]: spent many meetings putting this together.

111
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:55,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important that we have a commission like this that can integrate behavioral health into all the different city services that we're providing, and hopefully reduce the stigma around talking about behavioral health issues.

112
00:11:55,597 --> 00:12:03,242
[SPEAKER_05]: We've experienced behavioral health issues in my family, and I think it's important that we're able to talk about it and have resources to address it as a community.

113
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:03,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

114
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:04,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

115
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:06,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further questions?

116
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,406
[SPEAKER_10]: All in the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

117
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:16,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll for this paper to take its first reading.

[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

128
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:32,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli?

129
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:32,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

133
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:46,846
[SPEAKER_10]: This was for the unattended donation collection bin ordinance.

134
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:52,427
[SPEAKER_10]: The purpose of this was to regulate the placement of unattended donation bins within the city.

135
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:54,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

136
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:56,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

137
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:58,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

138
00:12:58,329 --> 00:12:58,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I move to,

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

145
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,791
Vice President Knight?

146
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:21,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

147
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:22,152
Councilor Marks?

148
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:22,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

149
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:23,633
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell?

150
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:24,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

151
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:25,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli?

152
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:26,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

153
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:27,156
[SPEAKER_10]: President Caraviello?

154
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:27,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

155
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:30,819
[SPEAKER_10]: 7 in the affirmative, motion passes.

156
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:48,368
[SPEAKER_10]: And the purpose of this is to regulate the placements of unattended donation bins within the city as to promote the community's health, safety and welfare by regulating unattended donation collection bins for clothing and other salvageable personal property in the city.

157
00:13:48,768 --> 00:13:56,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Ensure that unattended donation collections bins do not pose a hazard to a pedestrian and vehicular traffic.

158
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:18,712
[SPEAKER_10]: to ensure that the material is not allowed to accumulate outside the unattended donation collection bins, where it may be scattered by weather, animals, and humans, and establish a criteria to ensure that the unattended donation collection bins are suitably located and maintained in a clean and safe condition.

159
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:22,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Knight.

160
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:24,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

161
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:26,924
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an item that had come up for a number of years.

162
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,406
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that this council has been working on for more than one term.

163
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:33,429
[SPEAKER_08]: I know in the past I have sponsored resolutions to address it.

164
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:35,010
[SPEAKER_08]: You've sponsored resolutions to address it.

165
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks has as well, if my memory serves me correctly.

166
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:47,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe Councilor Falco and Scarpelli have also sponsored amendments or resolutions going forward to address the unattended donation collection bins in our community.

167
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:57,629
[SPEAKER_08]: All of us have been contacted by residents that live over by Felsway Plaza, live over by the mall, and other areas where these donation bins are located.

168
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,953
[SPEAKER_08]: And in some circumstances, they can become rather unsightly, Mr. President.

169
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,235
[SPEAKER_08]: The ordinance was a well thought out ordinance.

170
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:12,120
[SPEAKER_08]: It allows us to continue our textile recycling programs that our school PTOs be using for fundraising efforts.

171
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:29,131
[SPEAKER_08]: It allows us to properly address quality of life issues in the neighborhood with proper call numbers and information provided to residents when they have a complaint or a concern who's occupying or operating the donation collection bin and the like, Mr. President.

172
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:31,633
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a great ordinance that provides safeguards to our community.

173
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:32,994
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's something I'm very proud of.

174
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:37,438
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank my council colleagues for the hard work that they've put on it, and I'm glad to see this finally come to fruition.

175
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:38,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

176
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:39,981
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Vice President Knight.

177
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:40,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

178
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:43,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

179
00:15:44,004 --> 00:15:44,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

180
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Any council remarks?

181
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:49,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just be brief because I think Councilor Knight hit the nail on the head regarding this.

182
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:56,416
[SPEAKER_11]: For many years, these collection bins have existed in the community without any proper permitting.

183
00:15:57,116 --> 00:16:18,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this will go a long way to ensure residents of this community that may live next to an area that has a bin or may come in contact with a bin, that these bins are regulated by the community, by the city, and indeed adhere to all the rules and regulations which currently now we do have as a community.

184
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:22,650
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to thank my colleagues for their attention to this important

185
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:23,590
[SPEAKER_11]: matter.

186
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:24,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

187
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,433
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I could put my two cents in on this.

188
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:39,983
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the reason I sponsored this a couple years ago was because there was a bin, stuff, you know, screwing all over the place, and I ended up calling the company who had it, and the gentleman who I spoke to, which was very nice,

189
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:46,766
[SPEAKER_10]: He said he came right down and cleaned it, but he asked me if we had any ordinances in our city about this.

190
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:49,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I said no, we hadn't, and he was surprised that we hadn't.

191
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:53,909
[SPEAKER_10]: And he explained to me that many of the cities have the ordinances, and they also pay permit fees.

192
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what spurred me to do this again, and I'm glad we finally passed this after many years.

193
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,453
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad we're moving forward.

194
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:06,154
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

195
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:07,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

210
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:24,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

211
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,380
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was also for the take its first reading.

[SPEAKER_10]: And the last ordinance, 20519, City of Medford Ordinance, Health and Sanitation of the Code of the City of Medford.

213
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:40,456

214
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:47,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I move to cancel the rest of the reading and give a brief synopsis.

215
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:48,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

216
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:52,120
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Knight.

217
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

218
00:17:58,402 --> 00:17:58,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

219
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:00,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

220
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:02,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

221
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:02,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

222
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:04,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

223
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:04,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

224
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:05,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

225
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:05,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

226
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:06,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

227
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:07,505

[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello.

231
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative motion passes.

232
00:18:13,546 --> 00:18:21,828
[SPEAKER_10]: For this particular one, we've had many construction sites going on throughout the city and been a rat problem in many parts.

233
00:18:21,908 --> 00:18:31,270
[SPEAKER_10]: And all this was is to tighten up and strengthen our sanitation codes so the city has more enforcement and road control.

234
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Move approval.

235
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:35,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scott Belli.

236
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:36,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

237
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:44,753
[SPEAKER_02]: As we review these three ordinances, I think it's just a piece of what this council has been able to do.

238
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,235
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about a few of these

239
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:57,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Ordinances were visions that were started years ago, even before the beginning of this term.

240
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:05,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hard work from this council in the midst of a pandemic and making sure that we listen to our constituents.

241
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:14,660
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think when you talk about the donation bins, when you talk about the rodent issues, when you talk about the mental health issues and

242
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,842
[SPEAKER_02]: It really came to us from our constituents.

243
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:24,525
[SPEAKER_02]: These issues are brought to our attention from the people that are directly involved.

244
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:30,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And for this council to take its initiatives and hard work and make sure that we have

245
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:39,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Ordinance now in place to make sure that we're protecting and moving forward with some great initiatives.

246
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a job well done.

247
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to wait till all three.

248
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:46,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my fellow

249
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:59,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilors mentioned how much work that we put into these, but I wanted all three to be read before I mentioned and gave my two cents just in appreciation for everybody's hard work.

250
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:09,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this is what happens when people work together to make sure that we're putting our constituents first and their safety and well-being.

251
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:10,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Mr. President.

252
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

253
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:13,285
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion.

254
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

255
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Nait, Vice President Nait.

256
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:32,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think it's very important to point out that what this road and control ordinance does is it requires that there's an individual pest management program for permittees that are receiving permits for dumpsters, permits for food establishments.

257
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Permits for transfer and recycling facilities, keeping animals.

258
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:43,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Also permits for public property, individuals that are coming in our community to open our streets and provide construction services.

259
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:49,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, individuals that are composting in their backyards, and that's something that we've heard a lot about, Mr. President.

260
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:55,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Individuals that have seen rodent problems due to composting and the way that composting has been handled.

261
00:20:56,322 --> 00:21:01,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And this puts some regulations in here that allow us to continue composting in the community, but put some safeguards in.

262
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:04,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something that I'm very glad that the council supported.

263
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:08,855
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I do thank them for supporting that amendment that I added, and I move approval as well.

264
00:21:09,595 --> 00:21:10,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

265
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:12,117
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion by- President.

266
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:13,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

267
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

268
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,163
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll be brief on this one, but this is a long time coming.

269
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:27,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Pest control in the city, pest control management has been an issue for, I'd like to say, 10, 15, 20 years, Mr. President.

270
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It really has been a concern over the years.

271
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:36,392
[SPEAKER_11]: It comes and goes, depends on the time of season, depends on what's happening in the community.

272
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:40,553
[SPEAKER_11]: But it exists and it's there, and it's a quality of life issue.

273
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:50,115
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this ordinance goes a long way to rectify some of the concerns that residents have regarding pest control in the community.

274
00:21:50,135 --> 00:21:58,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank my colleagues because it wasn't part of this ordinance, but we did vote on a B paper.

275
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:13,005
[SPEAKER_11]: which is an administrative policy, this council requested as an administrative policy that the city administration set up a policy that would allow us to sign a waiver to deal with private homeowners.

276
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:22,370
[SPEAKER_11]: For instance, Mr. President, you may have an area of your yard that has a rat nest unbeknownst to yourself.

277
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,574
[SPEAKER_11]: However, the city has located this because it's on private property.

278
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:30,055
[SPEAKER_11]: It is the owner's responsibility.

279
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:40,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the city council saw fit to say, you know what, we have an obligation as a community to try to address needs that we have.

280
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:46,248
[SPEAKER_11]: And whether it's financial or not, if we can assist in a common goal

281
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:52,072
[SPEAKER_11]: the eradication of these pests, I think that's something we should move forward with.

282
00:22:52,692 --> 00:23:07,703
[SPEAKER_11]: And having a waiver that would hold the city free from liability and also accomplishing the same goals of pest control, I think help create a better policy and a better ordinance, Mr. President.

283
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:10,104
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank my colleagues for passing that.

284
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:18,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to thank the Director of Border Health and the Assistant City Solicitor for their input on this ordinance as well.

285
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:21,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Locks.

286

[SPEAKER_10]: President Caraviello?

301
00:23:45,061 --> 00:23:45,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

302
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:47,562
[SPEAKER_10]: 7 in the affirmative.

303
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:47,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

304
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:56,206
[SPEAKER_10]: 2-1-048 offered by Vice President Knight being so resolved that the Medford City Council requests an opinion from City Solicitor Scanlon on the following question.

305
00:23:57,312 --> 00:24:15,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the city of Medford current zoning comply with the recently adopted law HB 5250 and its requirements mandated under chapter 40A, section 3A of the general laws pertaining to the MBTA communities in multi-unit residential developments.

306
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Knight.

307
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:17,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

308
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:21,337
[SPEAKER_08]: This paper was passed by the state legislature and signed by the governor into law.

309
00:24:21,978 --> 00:24:32,826
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has a requirement that says that MBTA communities must have a high density zoning district within close proximity to their MBTA station, one MBTA station in their community.

310
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:38,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that it's 15 units per one acre is the defined basis.

311
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,433
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd just like to ask this question to the city solicitor as to whether or not we're in compliance.

312
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:48,954
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason I ask the question is because this council is going through a rigorous process of recodifying our zoning right now.

313
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:56,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Earlier this evening, we talked about housing production plan that the administration is working on with private consultants.

314
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:01,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's important, Mr. President, that we take into consideration

315
00:25:01,387 --> 00:25:14,253
[SPEAKER_08]: perspective all of the new changes that have happened at the state level to ensure that we're in compliance and that we're not spending money on consultants and studies and doing so not complying with the law.

316
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:25,739
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, it's just a request for information to ensure that as we move forward as a council in addressing our zoning here in the community, that we're doing so with the proper legal guidance and information necessary to make informed and wise decisions.

317
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:27,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

318
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further questions?

319
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:33,929
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

320
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:35,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

321
00:25:39,391 --> 00:25:39,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

322
00:25:40,692 --> 00:25:40,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

323
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:42,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

324
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:42,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

325
00:25:42,612 --> 00:25:44,633
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

326
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:44,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

327
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

328
00:25:45,974 --> 00:25:46,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

329
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:47,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

330
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:48,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

331
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:50,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

332
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:51,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

333
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:52,896
[SPEAKER_10]: President Caraviello.

334
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and the affirmative motion passes.

335
00:25:54,237 --> 00:25:56,938
[SPEAKER_10]: 2-1-049 offered by Vice President Knight.

336
00:25:57,698 --> 00:26:05,261
[SPEAKER_10]: being so resolved that the Medford City Council extended steep and sincere condolences to the family of Rose Mosher on her recent passing.

337
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:06,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Knight.

338
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

339
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:11,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli is also a co-sponsor of this resolution.

340
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:21,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of us know the Mosher family from the fine meals that we've all received when we cross the border over into Bar Square and go to Victor's Deli.

341
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:35,415
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure many of us have had the world famous chicken a la Rosa, or famous beef stew, or famous escarole soup, world famous calzones, steak and cheese, chicken pie, and the list goes on, Mr. President.

342
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:41,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Rosa Mosher opened a restaurant with her husband Victor called Victor's Deli over in Somerville some years ago.

343
00:26:41,758 --> 00:26:45,479
[SPEAKER_08]: And these longtime residents treated everybody like family.

344
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:51,122
[SPEAKER_08]: That restaurant was their kitchen, and that restaurant was their home, and everyone was allowed to eat around their dinner table.

345
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:55,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And Rosa recently passed due to some complications with her health.

346
00:26:55,563 --> 00:27:03,146
[SPEAKER_08]: And having recently retired from Victor's and passing the business on to her son Michael, who has expanded it to the Ball Square Cafe.

347
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:07,948
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been taking up some of Rosa's recipes and delivering them to the public over there.

348
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:12,450
[SPEAKER_08]: But Rosa recently passed, and she's someone that's touched so many people's lives, Mr. President.

349
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been going to Victor's Deli for as long as I can remember.

350
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:18,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Every Saturday morning in high school, we'd go down there and get chicken parm subs.

351
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:23,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Rosa would greet us with a big smile, and she'd put the order in before we even walked through the door.

352
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:28,942
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're short a couple of bucks, she was the first person to look the other way and tell you to get out the door before her husband caught you.

353
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:41,188
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a very, very kind person, a very warm soul, and she was someone that I was very lucky to have been able to forge a friendship with through patronizing her business, Mr. President.

354
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:44,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Long time Medford resident, I've had the opportunity of

355
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:51,002
[SPEAKER_08]: becoming great friends with her son, Michael, and her daughter, Nancy, over the years, all through the restaurant, Mr. President.

356
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:55,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just amazing what a small business in the community can do to bring so many people together.

357
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:57,488
[SPEAKER_08]: And Victor's Deli was really

358
00:27:57,938 --> 00:28:08,650
[SPEAKER_08]: one of those types of places where, whether you're from Medford or Somerville, the door was always open and people were always there gathering, meeting, having a laugh, sharing a sandwich, and, you know, just really getting to know each other.

359
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:16,118
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a place that we had a great sense of community, and that was because of the way that Rosa ran her business and the type of person that she was.

360
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:18,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Her business was no different than her home.

361
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:19,742
[SPEAKER_08]: The door was always open.

362
00:28:20,222 --> 00:28:27,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's someone, Mr. President, that's touched me over the years greatly with her humor and her kindness.

363
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's going to be sadly missed, Mr. President.

364
00:28:29,884 --> 00:28:33,165
[SPEAKER_08]: At the risk of babbling on any further, I will rest my case.

365
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:40,307
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's something that I certainly believe deserves some recognition this evening, is the service that Rose has done to the community in Victor's Deli.

366
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:44,978
[SPEAKER_08]: all that they've done for people here in the city of Medford, so I'd ask that the council support this resolution.

367
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:45,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

368
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Scarpelli.

369
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:47,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

370
00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:49,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilman, for bringing this forward.

371
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known the Mosher family for a long time.

372
00:28:55,161 --> 00:29:05,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I started first with interactions on Princeton Street, growing up next to my best friend as a child, and we spent a lot of time together.

373
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:15,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Then meeting, getting involved and sitting at Victor's and knowing the family.

374
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:18,713
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that's amazing is the type of person she was.

375
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:25,498
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a great mother to her great children and a great wife to her husband, hardworking husband.

376
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:31,062
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you realize with Mrs. Mosher, when you walked in that door, she treated everybody like family.

377
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:36,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I often brought, whenever I had issues with any of my students,

378
00:29:37,347 --> 00:29:43,593
[SPEAKER_02]: The place that I would want to go and they wanted to talk, I would take them to Victor's Deli because there was a nice quaint area.

379
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:51,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that Mrs. Mosher always did, and Nancy and Jason after Mr. Mosher's, really made people feel comfortable.

380
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:57,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you bring a young man from El Salvador who's got a lot to worry about and

381
00:30:00,244 --> 00:30:07,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mrs. Mosher walks over and they're looking at this elaborate menu of food that's prepared in front of them.

382
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:10,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Their eyes are stunned.

383
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mrs. Mosher is the type of person that made kids feel so welcome.

384
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:18,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And they gave them that opportunity to have a place.

385
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,622
[SPEAKER_02]: that they would feel that they were in their kitchen with their parents.

386
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:26,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was that type of person.

387
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:30,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that she leaves a huge void in our community.

388
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:36,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's in Somerville, but it's in our hearts.

389
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:37,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Method restaurant.

390
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:38,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Method business.

391
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's someone that we will definitely miss.

392
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:44,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Mike has mentioned

393
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:52,259
[SPEAKER_02]: A few times already that how proud he is and the honor that he'll give his mother to pass on her traditions.

394
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:58,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know Mike Mosha, he's got the same heart and she'll be missed.

395
00:30:58,684 --> 00:31:02,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So our condolences to the Mosha family and we wish her the rest of peace.

396
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:03,368
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

397
00:31:03,848 --> 00:31:04,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Escamilla.

398
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:05,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Box.

399
00:31:06,624 --> 00:31:07,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

400
00:31:07,504 --> 00:31:11,085
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on this evening.

401
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:16,867
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Victor's Deli, although it was in Somerville, I considered it a Medford restaurant.

402
00:31:17,947 --> 00:31:20,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Many Medford people attended Victor's Deli.

403
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:25,189
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the home-cooked meals made you feel like you were at home, as my colleagues mentioned.

404
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:28,790
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you went in there and got a sandwich, it tasted like you were at home.

405
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,351
[SPEAKER_11]: It tasted like you were eating with your family.

406
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:33,331
[SPEAKER_11]: And the atmosphere was the same way.

407
00:31:33,711 --> 00:31:35,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's how they always ran the business.

408
00:31:36,052 --> 00:31:42,396
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mrs. Mosher was truly, as my colleagues mentioned, a family person.

409
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:44,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Family meant everything to her.

410
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:46,738
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can see that in her kids.

411
00:31:47,478 --> 00:31:49,479
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see it in the way they carried themselves.

412
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,261
[SPEAKER_11]: And she will be solely missed, Mr. President.

413
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:53,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Miles.

414
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:54,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

415
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

416
00:31:57,295 --> 00:31:59,537
[SPEAKER_06]: My thoughts and prayers go out to the Moshe family.

417
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:04,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up with Mike and I've been to Victor's many times throughout the years.

418
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:10,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually I was talking to my mom just the other day and she was telling me how Mrs. Moshe passed away.

419
00:32:13,112 --> 00:32:27,641
[SPEAKER_06]: just a remarkable woman and I know you always hear about the food and it's just a great place to eat and great family atmosphere and a big part of our community, although it was right over the line at some level.

420
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:30,803
[SPEAKER_06]: So my thoughts and prayers go to the Mosher family.

421
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:31,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

422
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:35,025
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

423
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Biss?

424
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:38,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

425
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:42,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilors Knight and Scarpelli for putting this on.

426
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:51,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking of the Moshe family and the environment that they built to bring people of all ages and all backgrounds together around delicious food.

427
00:32:51,716 --> 00:33:05,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just reminded of one story of a Medford friend who was studying abroad and figured out a way to get two frozen Victor's calzones in their check bag and get it over to Denmark, because that's how much they loved it.

428
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:08,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Victor's deli and Rose's food.

429
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:11,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for putting this on and I'm thinking of the Moshe family.

430
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:13,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

431
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:15,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I could put my own in.

432
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:18,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the Moshe's many years.

433
00:33:19,252 --> 00:33:27,636
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there's been a Caraviello birthday party or a function that hasn't had Victor's calzones or barbecue from

434
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,836
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, for as many years as I can remember.

435
00:33:31,536 --> 00:33:34,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Always went in there, Rose and her husband and Mike are always good people.

436
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:40,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, good quality family and another loss to our community.

437
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:48,106
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see, they were always considered a Medford business, even though they were in Somerville, because probably most of the customers were from Medford.

438
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:52,029
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, my condolences on the passing on Rose, thank you.

439
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,911
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could please rise for a moment of silence.

440
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

441
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:19,666
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion was by Vice President Knight and Councilor Scott Feldman.

442
00:34:22,587 --> 00:34:23,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

443
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:24,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

444
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:25,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

445
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:26,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

446
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:27,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

447
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:27,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

448
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:28,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

449
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:29,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

450
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:30,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

451
00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:30,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

452
00:34:32,062 --> 00:34:32,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli?

453
00:34:32,942 --> 00:34:33,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

454
00:34:34,063 --> 00:34:34,763
[SPEAKER_12]: President Kiriboy?

455
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:35,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

456
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:38,104
[SPEAKER_10]: 7 in favor of the motion passes.

457
00:34:38,124 --> 00:34:40,985
[SPEAKER_10]: 21050 offered by Vice President Knight and Councilor Falco.

458
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:50,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it so resolved that the Director of Community Media provide the City Council with a cost estimate for closed captioning service.

459
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:51,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Knight.

460
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:54,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

461
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,730
[SPEAKER_08]: In recent weeks we've seen our

462
00:34:57,917 --> 00:35:03,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Colleagues in government on the school committee's broadcasts providing closed captioning services.

463
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:16,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Our human rights commission has discussed the city council's potential to expand the way that we communicate with people, whether it be through translation services, closed captioning services, and the like.

464
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, Mr. President, this is a rather self-explanatory resolution.

465
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:25,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It's to ask that our director of community media provide us with a cost estimate for closed captioning services.

466
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:31,505
[SPEAKER_08]: So that once we get that back, we can take the appropriate and necessary steps to ensure that it is provided during our broadcast.

467
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:34,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I yield the floor to Councilor Falco.

468
00:35:35,793 --> 00:35:36,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President.

469
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:37,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

470
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

471
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:40,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

472
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:43,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to go on the record of supporting this.

473
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:49,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is something that's important and it's about providing access to everyone in our community.

474
00:35:50,166 --> 00:36:00,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it will benefit anyone that is hearing impaired, but I think it would also benefit the many people at home that are watching, especially in this day of COVID where we're required to wear masks.

475
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:03,845
[SPEAKER_06]: it's going to hopefully help with that as well.

476
00:36:03,985 --> 00:36:12,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I think closed captioning will definitely benefit many people throughout our community and I move approval.

477
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:14,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

478
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:19,128
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

479
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:20,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

480
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:23,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears?

481
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:24,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

482
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:25,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco?

483
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:25,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

484
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:27,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight?

485
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:27,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

486
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks?

487
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,290
Yes.

488
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell?

489
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:32,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

490
00:36:32,822 --> 00:36:32,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

491
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:35,084
[SPEAKER_10]: President Caraviello.

492
00:36:35,144 --> 00:36:35,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

493
00:36:35,384 --> 00:36:38,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven affirmative motion passes.

494
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:40,550
[SPEAKER_10]: 21051 offered by Councilor Marks.

495
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:46,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the COVID-19 vaccination rollout be discussed.

496
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:47,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

497
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

498
00:36:50,781 --> 00:36:51,361
[SPEAKER_11]: And um,

499
00:36:52,312 --> 00:37:07,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I stated this a couple of weeks ago and it is still true that Massachusetts is considered a national healthcare leader with many of the top healthcare providers residing in Massachusetts.

500
00:37:09,224 --> 00:37:12,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Eight weeks after the first COVID vaccines were authorized,

501
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:19,792
[SPEAKER_11]: in Massachusetts, we rank in the bottom half of U.S.

502
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:24,856
[SPEAKER_11]: states in getting the injection to our residents and to our most vulnerable.

503
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:39,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Massachusetts trails every other New England state, including as well as New York, in the number of vaccine doses administered per capita, and that's according to federal figures.

504
00:37:41,403 --> 00:37:48,940
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been a concern, Mr. President, not of mine, but of many residents in this community, as well as my colleagues.

505
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:50,118
[SPEAKER_11]: for some time.

506
00:37:51,078 --> 00:38:15,696
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been some confusion recently with reverse 911 calls alerting residents to contact City Hall, the Council on Aging, the West Medford Community Center regarding the vaccination and I guess how to get assistance on where to go for a vaccination if you're 75 or older.

507
00:38:17,977 --> 00:38:37,972
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not concerned about pointing blame or looking back at why Massachusetts is in the predicament it's in right now, but I would like to look forward, Mr. President, and get some answers from our Board of Health regarding what is the next phase in rollout in this community.

508
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:46,604
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's important to find out what the plan is, because there's so much misinformation going around.

509
00:38:46,644 --> 00:38:59,269
[SPEAKER_11]: And we heard last week from the Board of Health Director that maybe the call that was made wasn't intended to create a list of potential residents that are 75 and older.

510
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,612
[SPEAKER_11]: to wait for a vaccination or for a call back.

511
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:09,174
[SPEAKER_11]: However, that was the case for many residents that called me.

512
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:16,759
[SPEAKER_11]: They thought they were on a list waiting for someone to get back to them to state when they'll get this shot locally.

513
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:29,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I realize the state set up a 2-1-1 system, which I guess has been somewhat effective in Massachusetts in getting the message out.

514
00:39:29,986 --> 00:39:35,794
[SPEAKER_11]: and also simplifying the process of applying for this vaccination.

515
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:40,180
[SPEAKER_11]: There are many residents right now that don't have access to a computer.

516
00:39:41,442 --> 00:39:45,267
[SPEAKER_11]: And under the old system with the state, you had to go online.

517
00:39:45,868 --> 00:39:54,195
[SPEAKER_11]: to fill out an application, a multi-page application, in which some residents weren't able to access, Mr. President.

518
00:39:54,616 --> 00:40:04,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm eager to hear from the Board of Health Director regarding what the plans are for the rollout in Method for our seniors 75 and older.

519
00:40:05,365 --> 00:40:12,692
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a call this afternoon from a senior that said she received a call from the Method Council on aging.

520
00:40:13,713 --> 00:40:22,151
[SPEAKER_11]: and they asked if she was still interested in getting the vaccination and that it would be available at some point.

521
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:24,765
[SPEAKER_11]: at the Andrews Middle School.

522
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:29,547
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the vaccination site for our first responders.

523
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:38,389
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently that will be the vaccination site for seniors that are 75 and older.

524
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:45,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, in this community, there may be a number of sites that are available to residents.

525
00:40:47,817 --> 00:40:59,166
[SPEAKER_11]: There was also talk, Mr. President, and I forget where I saw it or read it, that the governor is putting the phase two on hold now for residents 65 to 74.

526
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:08,574
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is quite alarming as well, because this is not something that you say, well, I may or may not get it.

527
00:41:08,654 --> 00:41:11,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I may decide to get it when I have some time.

528
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:13,998
[SPEAKER_11]: This is life or death that we're talking about.

529
00:41:14,658 --> 00:41:19,221
[SPEAKER_11]: This is people that may have co-morbidities that, you know, need to get the shot.

530
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:26,345
[SPEAKER_11]: This is people that are seniors that, you know, can't leave their home because they're infirm, Mr. President.

531
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:31,087
[SPEAKER_11]: And a mask only goes so far in hand-washing and social distancing.

532
00:41:31,647 --> 00:41:35,810
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thought of having a vaccination that

533
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:46,373
[SPEAKER_11]: could at least assist residents, I think goes a long way to assure people that they'll be safe during these tough and difficult times.

534
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:52,615
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask Mr. President, I don't know if the Board of Health Director is on the call, but if she's not-.

535
00:41:54,195 --> 00:42:12,616
[SPEAKER_11]: If she's not, Mr. President, I would ask that we receive an immediate update to the Medford City Council regarding what the plans are for the rollout, where the sites will be in Medford, how will residents be notified, how will we assist residents, Mr. President?

536
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:22,241
[SPEAKER_11]: There are many vulnerable residents out there that don't have the access, they don't have the whereabouts to do this on their own, and they need assistance.

537
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:31,585
[SPEAKER_11]: And they need someone to step in, and in this case, city government, to step in and assist these residents that are in need, Mr. President.

538
00:42:32,365 --> 00:42:34,847
[SPEAKER_11]: And that should be our number one concern right now.

539
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:43,912
[SPEAKER_11]: When you bump into a senior and you think they're of age or 75 or above, the first question should be, have you received your shot?

540
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:47,754
[SPEAKER_11]: The second question should be, if not, how can I assist you?

541
00:42:48,574 --> 00:42:54,577
[SPEAKER_11]: And that should be everyone asking, your neighbor, your cousin, your family member, someone you may bump into in the street.

542
00:42:55,298 --> 00:42:56,879
[SPEAKER_11]: And that really should be.

543
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:02,663
[SPEAKER_11]: the outcry to get this process underway and moving forward, Mr. President.

544
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:16,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of these state centers, from my own experience in trying to help my own family member, to go maybe to Fenway Park or Gillette Stadium, may be out of reach for a lot of people.

545
00:43:17,614 --> 00:43:21,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I've called the Melrose Wakefield Hospital.

546
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:24,800
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very difficult to get through.

547
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,503
[SPEAKER_11]: The appointments are not there, and I realize this is still in the early stages.

548
00:43:31,563 --> 00:43:41,167
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think more has to come from this community, because we'd like to service our seniors, Mr. President, in Medford.

549
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:44,129
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to service them in Medford.

550
00:43:45,335 --> 00:43:48,658
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the opportunity to go to Fenway Park just yesterday.

551
00:43:49,558 --> 00:44:02,749
[SPEAKER_11]: And I saw and witnessed firsthand many seniors, Mr. President, waiting long, winding roads in gate B and gate A that circled and circled.

552
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:14,278
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are people that, honestly, Mr. President, I don't think should be waiting in a line for 45 minutes to an hour waiting to get their vaccination.

553
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:21,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think how a society treats their seniors says a lot about society.

554
00:44:21,983 --> 00:44:37,074
[SPEAKER_11]: And in my opinion, if the vaccination's not available, and I hear what the mayor's saying that it's not available, we have to do our very best to make sure that we're assisting our seniors get this vaccination, Mr. President.

555
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:41,076
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the utmost of importance for us as a community.

556
00:44:41,736 --> 00:44:47,900
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look eager and forward to when we get a response back from the Board of Health Director.

557
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,223
[SPEAKER_11]: We probably should be hearing from the Board of Health Director every Tuesday, Mr. President.

558
00:44:54,888 --> 00:45:00,550
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure why we don't have just a regular every Tuesday that we get a five-minute conversation.

559
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,051
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on?

560
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:03,231
[SPEAKER_11]: How's the rollout?

561
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:04,472
[SPEAKER_11]: What are the next steps?

562
00:45:05,032 --> 00:45:07,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we need to ask this, Mr. President.

563
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:08,393
[SPEAKER_11]: This should be a given.

564
00:45:09,113 --> 00:45:13,755
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of seniors tune in on this meeting, and they get their information from this meeting.

565
00:45:14,075 --> 00:45:15,576
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not getting it from local papers.

566
00:45:15,836 --> 00:45:17,736
[SPEAKER_11]: They're certainly not getting it from the Internet.

567
00:45:18,317 --> 00:45:21,878
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're getting it, Mr. President, from maybe watching this meeting.

568
00:45:22,558 --> 00:45:26,604
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're certainly not getting it from gatherings because we can't gather anymore.

569
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:32,513
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's very important that that take place as well, Mr. President.

570
00:45:32,553 --> 00:45:37,700
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would ask that moving forward, if our health director, I know she's busy.

571
00:45:38,241 --> 00:45:40,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not downplaying her role, very busy.

572
00:45:41,302 --> 00:45:50,346
[SPEAKER_11]: But if she can give us five minutes on a Tuesday night to give us an update, I think it would go a long way to alerting this council that feels a lot of phone calls.

573
00:45:50,846 --> 00:46:01,491
[SPEAKER_11]: But as well as the many, many seniors and other residents that can alert their loved ones on what's happening and information that will be vital to their health, Mr. President.

574
00:46:01,851 --> 00:46:02,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

575
00:46:02,771 --> 00:46:03,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

576
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:04,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

577
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:05,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

578
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:17,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, Councilor Marks, thank you so much because after your issues and questions that you brought to the forefront last week, I too received many phone calls.

579
00:46:17,744 --> 00:46:25,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And if my council colleague would allow me, I would really, I'd like to amend this paper to ask the city administration.

580
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:31,809
[SPEAKER_02]: a very talented Director of Communications, and Jackie Peeks.

581
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:40,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been fortunate enough to work with Jackie as a partner when she was in a neighboring community, and she is a wealth of knowledge.

582
00:46:41,076 --> 00:46:47,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that what Councilman Mox is saying, our seniors need to be informed of what's going on.

583
00:46:48,502 --> 00:46:52,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know that our Director of Health last week was adamant that

584
00:46:54,066 --> 00:47:10,476
[SPEAKER_02]: that X, Y, and Z was happening, but we were getting, and I'll be honest with you, my own mother got the phone call saying that she was set up to take the vaccine in Medford, and then to hear that that wasn't true.

585
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:17,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the issues that are true, so we have to find a way through public health announcements and addressing it and head on.

586
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:22,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot of very talented people.

587
00:47:22,085 --> 00:47:34,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll point my finger across the hall right now to Pat Gordon, and there's got to be a way that we can send out public health addresses to our constituents on the loop, especially our seniors.

588
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,780
[SPEAKER_02]: with some sort of a message.

589
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:47,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the mayor's done some great announcements in her office with some great initiatives in using the public, the community cable.

590
00:47:48,443 --> 00:47:54,644
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an easy way to reach a whole needy community, which is our seniors.

591
00:47:55,064 --> 00:47:59,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to inform them of what's happening, the process of what's going to happen.

592
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:04,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Councilman Mach said, a lot of seniors don't know what's happening.

593
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:18,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we heard in the past was that the city worked, did their due diligence by setting aside a location and getting ready to rent a location to administer the vaccine.

594
00:48:18,443 --> 00:48:22,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that fell through because the governor didn't come through with the vaccinations.

595
00:48:22,926 --> 00:48:24,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can understand that, but

596
00:48:25,308 --> 00:48:27,469
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be a plan in place as we move forward.

597
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:29,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be something that's happening in two weeks.

598
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:33,093
[SPEAKER_02]: But we should be pairing our seniors right now and what they should be doing.

599
00:48:33,793 --> 00:48:37,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And how this should be informed, because this is,

600
00:48:41,038 --> 00:48:41,679
[SPEAKER_02]: It is serious.

601
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:53,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that before we came to this meeting, I lost a very good friend because of the COVID and a lot had to do with his and his residence.

602
00:48:53,132 --> 00:48:57,617
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a son who's a teacher that came home and didn't know he had it.

603
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:05,543
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the issues that we're going to hear as we go to opening the schools and making sure our teachers are vaccinated.

604
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:09,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, the biggest issue I see are our seniors.

605
00:49:09,506 --> 00:49:18,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be more transparent, to use that word, that it's so easily thrown around this community.

606
00:49:18,712 --> 00:49:25,636
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be more transparent when it comes to informing our seniors especially, and what needs to be done.

607
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:30,445
[SPEAKER_02]: with achieving this life-saving vaccine.

608
00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:44,299
[SPEAKER_02]: So please, I implore the mayor and the administration to please find a way, working with our communications director, reaching out to our different avenues, whether it's letter form and tax bills, whether it's

609
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Using COVID relief money if it's still there to send information out via letters.

610
00:49:51,343 --> 00:50:01,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's setting up a loop on channel 15 and 22 and channel 3 to make sure that residents, you could point to a senior to say, hey, turn on channel so and so.

611
00:50:02,229 --> 00:50:05,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch that, watch the loop, it'll tell you what's happening.

612
00:50:06,091 --> 00:50:10,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it's the vaccine's not ready to come out yet, we don't have the vaccines, but

613
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:15,976
[SPEAKER_02]: When it does, this is what's going to happen, A, B, and C. That's what they need.

614
00:50:17,356 --> 00:50:31,923
[SPEAKER_02]: The governor right away, when he's first rolled out this wonderful plan of senior citizens going on to a website and then maneuvering through 66 different sites to then sign up for some place and not be available.

615
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And then realize, there's something really simple.

616
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:35,905
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just dial 211.

617
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:41,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, that doesn't make that, hey, we have C-Clicks Fix.

618
00:50:41,491 --> 00:50:55,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if we could find a way with C-Clicks Fix that seniors can call that number, dial 311, and have a person designated, maybe through the health department, that says, I'm a Method resident, I'm a senior citizen, please guide me.

619
00:50:57,078 --> 00:51:01,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have initiatives, we have these tools in place in this community.

620
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:10,506
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to be transparent in the sense that forward thinking to move this forward and try to find a way to get the word out that's so desperately needed.

621
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:12,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I know that we've

622
00:51:14,628 --> 00:51:18,531
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no blame to go around, I don't think, I think this is a crazy time.

623
00:51:19,172 --> 00:51:29,259
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if we don't have the vaccines right now, we should have a plan in place to inform our seniors that this is what's happening, this is when it's going to happen.

624
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:39,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, I'm sorry for rambling, but to hear the desperation and some of the seniors that I talked to over the last week.

625
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:47,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It's frightening and some of the simplest things that they just want to go for a walk.

626
00:51:47,994 --> 00:51:54,017
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to go to their salon and get their hair done and not think that they're going to come back and die.

627
00:51:54,617 --> 00:51:59,780
[SPEAKER_02]: And one resident I talked to said, George, I just want to hug my grandkids.

628
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:02,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And that speaks volumes.

629
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:07,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we please, we need to move forward with this in a more sensitive and proactive manner.

630
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:08,583
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

631
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:10,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

632
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:11,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

633
00:52:11,845 --> 00:52:12,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

634
00:52:12,766 --> 00:52:15,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

635
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:18,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, a very, very important issue.

636
00:52:19,029 --> 00:52:23,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Our community has suffered tremendously.

637
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:27,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we all know someone who's probably had COVID or unfortunately has passed away from COVID.

638
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:34,808
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a high level of COVID-19 in our community, and we have a lot of senior citizens in our community.

639
00:52:35,549 --> 00:52:36,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we're getting calls.

640
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:38,674
[SPEAKER_06]: People want to know what's the plan.

641
00:52:39,294 --> 00:52:40,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree with Councilor Marks.

642
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:43,000
[SPEAKER_06]: We should be getting weekly updates from the administration.

643
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:50,604
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Mary Ann O'Connor has done, she's been working, I know, night and day, probably 24-7.

644
00:52:51,344 --> 00:52:54,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know she's come before us before and given us updates.

645
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:56,625
[SPEAKER_06]: But we really need to make sure we're getting updates.

646
00:52:57,366 --> 00:52:58,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilman Marks is correct.

647
00:52:58,766 --> 00:52:59,906
[SPEAKER_06]: People do watch this meeting.

648
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:02,427
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of senior citizens watch this meeting.

649
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:05,327
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of times they get their news through this meeting.

650
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:08,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to know what the message is.

651
00:53:08,168 --> 00:53:09,248
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to know the plan.

652
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:20,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore, when we talk to people, we can distribute that plan as well, make sure that our community knows what's going on, what's the plan, how are we going to move forward as a community.

653
00:53:22,352 --> 00:53:24,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a number of questions, I guess.

654
00:53:24,154 --> 00:53:28,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the council wouldn't mind me amending the resolution as well, I greatly appreciate it.

655
00:53:29,658 --> 00:53:38,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Councilor Marks already mentioned, you know, do we have plans to host a vaccination site similar to the one of the first responders that was held at the Andrews Middle School?

656
00:53:39,246 --> 00:53:41,688
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think Councilor Marks already mentioned that.

657
00:53:42,628 --> 00:53:44,210
[SPEAKER_06]: But my next question would be, I guess,

658
00:53:45,538 --> 00:54:00,284
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, has the Method Board of Health or the Health Director been in contact with our local pharmacies or healthcare providers to partner with them to vaccinate residents in phase one, part one of phase two and beyond?

659
00:54:00,645 --> 00:54:07,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Has there been any contact with the Board of Health or the Health Director with these pharmacies or healthcare providers?

660
00:54:08,468 --> 00:54:12,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Have they contacted Lawrence Memorial Hospital and worked through them, Hallmark Health?

661
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:17,959
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Vanguard, has there been any contact there?

662
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:32,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the other things that, you know, one of the other questions I guess would be, you know, how many vaccine doses are allocated to Medford each week by the state?

663
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:37,504
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the other questions I guess I have is also,

664
00:54:39,622 --> 00:54:43,064
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody is a city employee, let's take a look at our city employees.

665
00:54:43,925 --> 00:54:50,588
[SPEAKER_06]: If a city employee gets sick, do they have a special sick bank for COVID related illness?

666
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:53,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's something that needs to be looked at.

667
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:57,572
[SPEAKER_06]: And then maybe that's something we could get back from our human resource director.

668
00:54:59,173 --> 00:55:07,258
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when people get the vaccine, a lot of people that next day, especially after the second shot from what I'm hearing, there's sometimes not healthcare effects.

669
00:55:09,728 --> 00:55:15,392
[SPEAKER_06]: people covered under special sick bank time so they can be out.

670
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:19,295
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure we're encouraging people to get the vaccine.

671
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:28,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's make sure that if they get the vaccine and they get, there's an adverse effect or allergic reaction that they cover.

672
00:55:29,622 --> 00:55:31,543
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to get answers to those questions as well.

673
00:55:31,903 --> 00:55:36,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So I respectfully like to amend the resolution if my council colleague wouldn't mind.

674
00:55:37,107 --> 00:55:37,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

675
00:55:40,477 --> 00:55:41,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

676
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks and my fellow councilors for their comments.

677
00:55:45,281 --> 00:55:57,071
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've seen not just the bottom half, but that we're 44th or 48th in the country for vaccinations as a state, which is very disappointing and disappointing management by state government to say the least.

678
00:55:57,551 --> 00:56:02,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am aware that the legislature is looking at taking additional action on this.

679
00:56:03,016 --> 00:56:04,797
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully there will be more updates on that.

680
00:56:06,308 --> 00:56:10,073
[SPEAKER_05]: just wanted to really support what Councilor Mark said.

681
00:56:10,114 --> 00:56:13,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be great to have the Board of Health giving a weekly update.

682
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:19,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we requested monthly updates in the fall, but I think at this point it does make sense to

683
00:56:20,262 --> 00:56:21,223
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to continue to do that.

684
00:56:21,243 --> 00:56:25,805
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to increase that to weekly and also really want to support the councilor start Kelly said.

685
00:56:26,546 --> 00:56:32,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need a coordinated effort and clear messaging around the vaccination plan for the city that brings together

686
00:56:40,094 --> 00:56:49,327
[SPEAKER_05]: We did, I think, a pretty good job in the springtime of getting housing resources and food resources out with easily shareable graphics online.

687
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:53,553
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a mailer that went out around some of those resources as well.

688
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:56,777
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's really important that we have that coordinated effort.

689
00:56:58,078 --> 00:57:04,919
[SPEAKER_05]: that we have to let people know exactly what the plan is.

690
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:12,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel that a lot of calls this week as well from people who are confused about how they could get a vaccine appointment.

691
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:15,821
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I agree we need a plan for Medford.

692
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:23,943
[SPEAKER_05]: But as of now, I have just continued to point people to ma immunizations.org, which is the state website that

693
00:57:25,163 --> 00:57:32,630
[SPEAKER_05]: subpar but it is the website that the state has created and now to the 2-1-1 hotline that was created late last week.

694
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:42,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So that that is where I am pointing people now and hopefully we can have an answer on the city's plan and you know a clear coordinated messaging strategy as soon as possible.

695
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:44,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

696
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilor Berry.

697
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:45,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell.

698
00:57:47,017 --> 00:57:47,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

699
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:52,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to echo what a lot of my colleagues have already said to Councilor Behr's point.

700
00:57:52,503 --> 00:58:00,031
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we did ask in the fall, we passed a resolution to get monthly updates on COVID from our Department of Public Health.

701
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,754
[SPEAKER_09]: We've gotten those sporadically.

702
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:06,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I absolutely agree with Councilor Marks that this is something that should be happening weekly at this point.

703
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:09,310
[SPEAKER_09]: to minimize misinformation.

704
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:13,633
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a lack of information spurs a lot of misinformation or people just trying to piece together.

705
00:58:13,653 --> 00:58:17,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we had some, I had some people reach out today.

706
00:58:17,857 --> 00:58:19,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Some information on our website was not correct.

707
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:21,159
[SPEAKER_09]: We were able to address that.

708
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:29,726
[SPEAKER_09]: But having, as the other councilors have iterated, having these real-time updates at the council meetings will help to address a lot of the issues we're facing.

709
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that

710
00:58:31,848 --> 00:58:40,691
[SPEAKER_09]: we're talking about right now is a communications problem and that we can absolutely do something about.

711
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:43,452
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a communications director now, as has been pointed out.

712
00:58:43,472 --> 00:58:50,774
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's something as everyone else has pointed out that we need to come together as a city to make sure the right information, the most up-to-date information

713
00:58:51,834 --> 00:59:02,021
[SPEAKER_09]: is there to keep our residents informed in light of kind of the scramble that's gone on the state level, because maybe they don't have as together as they should, but we can make up for that at least with real-time information.

714
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:04,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

715
00:59:04,783 --> 00:59:05,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

716
00:59:06,904 --> 00:59:07,644
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion.

717
00:59:07,664 --> 00:59:08,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, if I may.

718
00:59:09,465 --> 00:59:10,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Knight.

719
00:59:11,307 --> 00:59:13,028
[SPEAKER_08]: This council has

720
00:59:14,013 --> 00:59:19,034
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been requesting the city's vaccination plan since December 15th.

721
00:59:19,654 --> 00:59:25,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Since before Christmas, we've been asking what the vaccination plan is and what direction we're going to go in.

722
00:59:27,036 --> 00:59:33,778
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unfortunate that at our state level of government, we have been unable to get this together.

723
00:59:34,758 --> 00:59:36,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's sad, Mr. President, I really do.

724
00:59:38,587 --> 00:59:45,549
[SPEAKER_08]: We look at a congressperson being elevated to one of the more powerful positions in the US House.

725
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:51,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I call on the mayor to reach out to our colleagues in government that represent us here in Medford.

726
00:59:51,991 --> 01:00:01,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if we're 44th in the country in the distribution of vaccinations, but we are, as Councilor Mark said, the premier provider of health institutions in the world, there's something wrong.

727
01:00:02,495 --> 01:00:04,355
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something wrong, Mr. President.

728
01:00:04,615 --> 01:00:06,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And every day that goes by, someone else dies.

729
01:00:07,797 --> 01:00:09,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Every day that goes by, someone else dies.

730
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:13,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't want weekly updates about what we're going to be doing.

731
01:00:13,884 --> 01:00:20,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a vaccination plan in place where we're actually have boots on the ground, needles going in arms and people getting vaccinated, Mr. President.

732
01:00:22,514 --> 01:00:27,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we not know that there was going to be a vaccination at some point in time?

733
01:00:28,382 --> 01:00:30,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all knew there was going to be a vaccination.

734
01:00:30,264 --> 01:00:35,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we maybe focused a little bit too much on testing and a little bit less on a solution to the problem, Mr. President.

735
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:43,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we are now, almost two months later from our initial request for a vaccination plan, and we still don't have one.

736
01:00:44,657 --> 01:00:52,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's problematic, Mr. President, because if the council is asking for the vaccination plan, it's because we know it's a pressing need in this community because we've all heard it.

737
01:00:54,227 --> 01:01:07,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So I support my council colleagues in figuring out what's going on, because we need to get the appropriate and sufficient amount of doses to address our high need community.

738
01:01:07,973 --> 01:01:16,796
[SPEAKER_08]: And as Councilor Marks has stated a number of times in the past, Medford has a high number of senior citizens that reside in this community, higher than the state average.

739
01:01:18,137 --> 01:01:20,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, we should be a priority community, Mr. President.

740
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:24,973
[SPEAKER_08]: looking at the number of individuals that we have that would fall into the high risk categories.

741
01:01:25,913 --> 01:01:28,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I support, I support my colleagues and moving forward.

742
01:01:29,594 --> 01:01:30,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want updates.

743
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:30,955
[SPEAKER_08]: I want action.

744
01:01:31,135 --> 01:01:32,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a vaccination plan.

745
01:01:32,795 --> 01:01:36,296
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, I think that the public needs to be informed in a better fashion.

746
01:01:36,436 --> 01:01:44,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do have all the faith in the world and Jackie Peaks and her ability in the communication office to put together a comprehensive communication strategy that will meet that goal.

747
01:01:45,019 --> 01:01:45,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

748
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:46,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

749
01:01:47,323 --> 01:02:01,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so on the motion, Mr. President, just if I could, Mr. President, and when this pandemic first started, the city administration implemented the R U OK program.

750
01:02:02,959 --> 01:02:17,945
[SPEAKER_11]: And in my opinion, that was a tremendous success, reaching out to thousands of seniors in this community by phone, Mr. President, or by email, and asking if they are OK and if they had any particular needs.

751
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:24,889
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just think this would be a great program to extend regarding the vaccinations.

752
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:30,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know you were involved, Mr. President, in making the phone calls when this first started.

753
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:33,174
[SPEAKER_11]: And you made hundreds of phone calls out to seniors.

754
01:02:33,635 --> 01:02:38,698
[SPEAKER_11]: And you would know firsthand that the many thousands of seniors in this community

755
01:02:39,438 --> 01:02:49,325
[SPEAKER_11]: whether they're in the process of getting an injection on their own or so forth, it would be so nice to get a call from city government to say, are you okay now?

756
01:02:49,705 --> 01:02:52,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you need assistance with the vaccine?

757
01:02:52,948 --> 01:02:55,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the answer is no, then you go on to the next person.

758
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,231
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that would go a long way.

759
01:02:58,312 --> 01:03:05,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would respectfully ask as part of an amendment that the mayor use the

760
01:03:06,317 --> 01:03:13,083
[SPEAKER_11]: our UOK program, which was very successful, and extend that to, do you need a vaccination program?

761
01:03:14,064 --> 01:03:16,846
[SPEAKER_11]: And reach out to all the seniors in the community.

762
01:03:17,147 --> 01:03:18,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, we're looking at phase one.

763
01:03:18,988 --> 01:03:22,912
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you're 65 and older, in my opinion, you should be on the list.

764
01:03:23,972 --> 01:03:31,598
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying 75 and older now for phase one, and that's fine, and other people with medical conditions and comorbidities and so forth.

765
01:03:32,019 --> 01:03:41,626
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think they should be looking at, the city should be reaching out to people 65 and older, Mr. President, and making those thousands of calls, and let residents know we're there.

766
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Let them know we're there.

767
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:46,708
[SPEAKER_11]: We get the reverse 911 call, that's great.

768
01:03:47,028 --> 01:03:48,969
[SPEAKER_11]: We can see it on local access, that's great.

769
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:57,251
[SPEAKER_11]: But the personal phone call really goes a long way to let people know, hey, I matter, I care, and someone's looking out for my best interest.

770
01:03:57,651 --> 01:03:59,771
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we're obligated to do that, Mr. President.

771
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:02,192
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd ask that as an amendment as well.

772
01:04:03,477 --> 01:04:05,438
[SPEAKER_10]: All in the motion by Councilor Marks.

773
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:06,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by?

774
01:04:06,699 --> 01:04:06,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

775
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:08,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

776
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:15,583
[SPEAKER_10]: As amended by Councilor Marks and Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Falco.

777
01:04:17,004 --> 01:04:18,585
[SPEAKER_10]: And Councilor Marks for a second time.

778
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I get them all?

779
01:04:20,066 --> 01:04:23,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I miss anything?

780
01:04:23,748 --> 01:04:25,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

781
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:27,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

782
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:28,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

783
01:04:29,311 --> 01:04:29,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

784
01:04:30,231 --> 01:04:30,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

785
01:04:31,011 --> 01:04:31,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

786
01:04:31,932 --> 01:04:32,032
Yes.

787
01:04:32,658 --> 01:04:33,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks?

788
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:33,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

789
01:04:34,339 --> 01:04:34,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell?

790
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:35,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

791
01:04:36,379 --> 01:04:37,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli?

792
01:04:37,379 --> 01:04:37,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

793
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:38,700
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello?

794
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

795
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:43,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative motion passes.

796
01:04:43,641 --> 01:04:46,562
[SPEAKER_10]: 21052 offered by Councilor Falco and Vice President Knight.

797
01:04:47,482 --> 01:04:58,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Be resolved that the mayor include in the fiscal year 2022 municipal budget in appropriation to hire an attorney to represent the city council respectfully.

798
01:04:58,526 --> 01:04:59,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

799
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:01,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

800
01:05:01,177 --> 01:05:08,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to begin by just saying this is no reflection on our acting city solicitor, Kim Scanlon.

801
01:05:09,144 --> 01:05:10,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Kim does a remarkable job.

802
01:05:10,505 --> 01:05:11,947
[SPEAKER_06]: She's always there to answer questions.

803
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:13,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I have called her numerous times.

804
01:05:13,328 --> 01:05:16,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want this to reflect fully on her.

805
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:17,712
[SPEAKER_06]: It has nothing to do with her.

806
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:22,096
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I want to do is I believe that we need

807
01:05:23,373 --> 01:05:29,775
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a line item in the budget, the city council does, to hire an attorney.

808
01:05:30,455 --> 01:05:32,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is basically to help us with our weekly work.

809
01:05:33,036 --> 01:05:42,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you take a look each week, I think more and more when we talk about these issues, we're talking about issues that have legal implications.

810
01:05:43,078 --> 01:05:44,979
[SPEAKER_06]: There's all kinds of legal type questions.

811
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:49,000
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really need an attorney that's going to be able to help us out with these things.

812
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:55,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I think anybody that's watched the beginning of the meeting until now, we passed three ordinances earlier tonight.

813
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:58,784
[SPEAKER_06]: They passed their first reading.

814
01:05:59,484 --> 01:06:07,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Three ordinances, and all of them took a tremendous amount of work and time from Kim Scanlon and our legal department.

815
01:06:08,567 --> 01:06:10,148
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also took the help of KP Law.

816
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:16,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, KP Law has helped us with a number of different ordinances that we passed last year.

817
01:06:17,151 --> 01:06:21,013
[SPEAKER_06]: With KP Law, you get a different attorney for, you know.

818
01:06:22,405 --> 01:06:23,846
[SPEAKER_06]: all the different issues that you're working on.

819
01:06:23,906 --> 01:06:25,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need consistency.

820
01:06:25,726 --> 01:06:29,708
[SPEAKER_06]: We need someone that actually can come in, help us with our work.

821
01:06:30,068 --> 01:06:30,989
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a lot of work.

822
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:43,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to make sure that it's someone that can work with us week in and week out to help us push our ordinances forward, answer any type of legal questions that come up during our meetings.

823
01:06:43,494 --> 01:06:44,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's important.

824
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,395
[SPEAKER_06]: We need consistency and guidance.

825
01:06:48,536 --> 01:06:51,297
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and the city council will benefit from its own attorney.

826
01:06:52,737 --> 01:06:58,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I firmly believe in this, I believe this may have been on last year, I'm not sure if I offered it, but it might have been offered by one of my colleagues as well.

827
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,202
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really believe that this needs to be part of our upcoming budget.

828
01:07:02,822 --> 01:07:07,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd ask respectfully that my council and our colleagues support this, and I move approval.

829
01:07:10,564 --> 01:07:11,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

830
01:07:11,925 --> 01:07:16,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I also echo Councilor Falco's sentiments concerning City Solicitor Scanlon.

831
01:07:16,868 --> 01:07:20,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I've known City Solicitor Scanlon now going back what feels like 100 years.

832
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:21,070
[SPEAKER_08]: We went to high school together.

833
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,751
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a very capable person.

834
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:26,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I know her very well personally and professionally, and I think she's doing an excellent job.

835
01:07:28,674 --> 01:07:29,595
[SPEAKER_08]: This item came up.

836
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,420
[SPEAKER_08]: last year is one of our council priorities.

837
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:48,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the committee of the whole that we have, the administration talked about this great new contract that they were going to be executing with a firm called KP Law, who based upon the bills I've received from the administration, we still haven't paid, or been billed for.

838
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:58,032
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of the biggest things, I think, Mr. President, to promote a successful relationship between an attorney and a client is trust.

839
01:07:59,104 --> 01:08:02,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And KP Law came before us and we asked them the question.

840
01:08:03,241 --> 01:08:03,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's your boss?

841
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:06,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you working for the city council right now, or are you working for the administration?

842
01:08:07,143 --> 01:08:08,443
[SPEAKER_08]: They said, we're working for the administration.

843
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:09,824
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just giving the city council advice.

844
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:15,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that trust is there with KP Law, with this group, with this council in KP Law.

845
01:08:15,606 --> 01:08:16,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think we have that trust.

846
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:20,428
[SPEAKER_08]: And quite frankly, we're a very productive council, Mr. President.

847
01:08:20,568 --> 01:08:26,731
[SPEAKER_08]: As Councilor Falco pointed out, we pumped out three ordinances tonight for first reading, but we didn't just pump them out.

848
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:30,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Those took years, I mean literal years, for us to finally get to this point.

849
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:42,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we'd be able to enhance our levels of productivity if we had the necessary technical expertise and support on issues like zoning, the open meeting law.

850
01:08:43,697 --> 01:08:51,019
[SPEAKER_08]: The drafting of ordinances, the compliance with Chapter 40A, the crafting of requests for information from the administration.

851
01:08:51,099 --> 01:08:57,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Because sometimes I feel like we spend more time asking for information that we're entitled to than we do about actually working on the work.

852
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:03,921
[SPEAKER_08]: And more importantly, Mr. President, we'll have somebody here that will help us ensure compliance with the law.

853
01:09:04,901 --> 01:09:07,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody on this board took an oath.

854
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:14,382
[SPEAKER_08]: that to the best of their abilities they were going to uphold the laws of the Constitution of the United States, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the ordinances in this community.

855
01:09:15,553 --> 01:09:25,676
[SPEAKER_08]: By having legal counsel available handily to provide us with that technical expertise and support will be beneficial and will only make us a more productive body, number one.

856
01:09:25,736 --> 01:09:29,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, it will make us a more productive body, Mr. President.

857
01:09:29,617 --> 01:09:35,799
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that I feel is a necessary priority for inclusion in the next fiscal year's budget.

858
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:43,002
[SPEAKER_08]: As we see an increasing number of matters coming before us,

859
01:09:44,082 --> 01:09:50,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's necessary for us to ensure that we have the tools to do the job appropriately and properly.

860
01:09:53,284 --> 01:09:55,865
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I'm going to support this resolution this evening, Mr. President.

861
01:09:55,925 --> 01:10:12,369
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I'm going to be very concerned if when we start our pre-budget meetings, which are coming up relatively shortly, which were also a council priority from last year, if this isn't included in some of those discussions, I'm going to have a very difficult time moving forward and supporting a budget that doesn't

862
01:10:15,074 --> 01:10:20,796
[SPEAKER_08]: adequately support the city council in the work and time and efforts that it puts in to meet our obligations.

863
01:10:21,296 --> 01:10:24,257
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I second the motion of Councilor Falco.

864
01:10:25,678 --> 01:10:26,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

865
01:10:27,518 --> 01:10:29,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further questions?

866
01:10:29,902 --> 01:10:30,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

867
01:10:30,783 --> 01:10:31,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

868
01:10:32,304 --> 01:10:35,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Falco for putting this on the agenda.

869
01:10:35,687 --> 01:10:41,331
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been a priority of this council for a number of years to get its own representation.

870
01:10:42,052 --> 01:10:58,685
[SPEAKER_11]: It's no different than the Medford School Committee that has their own legal council of which this council on a number of issues I think would benefit from having legal advice that's towards the city council.

871
01:10:59,765 --> 01:11:10,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that statement being made, Mr. President, I do want to say the current acting city solicitor has been acting city solicitor for over a year now.

872
01:11:11,873 --> 01:11:13,054
[SPEAKER_11]: One year, Mr. President.

873
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:18,297
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's about time the city administration makes a move.

874
01:11:19,264 --> 01:11:25,389
[SPEAKER_11]: And in my opinion, they should make the current acting city solicitor the city solicitor and move forward.

875
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:32,655
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no reason why that position should be held over anyone's head for any length of time, Mr. President.

876
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:46,887
[SPEAKER_11]: As was stated by my colleagues, the person in that role was the assistant city solicitor under former solicitor Mark Rumley, where I'm sure she learned a lot from solicitor Rumley that was there for over three decades.

877
01:11:47,947 --> 01:12:12,032
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am very confident in her capabilities, Mr. President, as the lead legal counsel in this community, and would respectfully ask that this city administration, they tend to slow down when it comes to appointments and a number of other items, Mr. President, that they appoint this city, acting city solicitor, as city solicitor.

878
01:12:12,392 --> 01:12:12,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

879
01:12:13,773 --> 01:12:14,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

880
01:12:14,973 --> 01:12:15,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears.

881
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

882
01:12:17,361 --> 01:12:19,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Councilor Marks brings up a great point.

883
01:12:20,623 --> 01:12:26,186
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Kim has been acting city solicitor for over a year and we don't have an assistant city solicitor.

884
01:12:26,306 --> 01:12:33,531
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we've been sending a lot of work to that office when they are, you know, down one person at the very least.

885
01:12:33,611 --> 01:12:35,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So I support this as well.

886
01:12:35,592 --> 01:12:44,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I think with the volume of requests for draft ordinances and review of ordinances that we are taking on, which is our job, we need someone dedicated to

887
01:12:46,132 --> 01:12:47,293
[SPEAKER_05]: to working with us on that.

888
01:12:47,713 --> 01:12:48,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

889
01:12:48,814 --> 01:12:49,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

890
01:12:49,755 --> 01:12:59,042
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I could voice my opinion, you know, from day one, when I was on this council, we had a city solicitor in the building.

891
01:13:00,003 --> 01:13:08,790
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think Assistant Kim Scanlon was there when I first got elected, but somewhere along the line, we had an assistant.

892
01:13:09,491 --> 01:13:14,435
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we have an acting city solicitor and we have this

893
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:22,807
[SPEAKER_10]: major law firm with piles of attorneys, and we're getting less representation than we've ever gotten.

894
01:13:23,327 --> 01:13:25,889
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, my fellow councilors are right.

895
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:29,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we need to get this legal situation in hand.

896
01:13:30,392 --> 01:13:35,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we've asked many times, where are we in our legal budget going forward?

897
01:13:36,215 --> 01:13:38,597
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think we've gotten an answer to that question yet.

898
01:13:41,344 --> 01:14:03,823
[SPEAKER_10]: If Councilor, I mean, Councilor Falco wouldn't mind if I could amend it to ask again, where are we in our legal cost between our acting solicitor and the money we spent at KP, not only on the reasonable, on the monthly fee, but on the other projects that we're paying them to do?

899
01:14:03,843 --> 01:14:05,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And make that a form of amendment.

900
01:14:06,605 --> 01:14:07,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I would second that amendment.

901
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:09,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Knight.

902
01:14:09,982 --> 01:14:11,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I second the amendment, Mr. President.

903
01:14:13,444 --> 01:14:14,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions?

904
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:14,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

905
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:21,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I also, Mr. President, would like to add a B paper or a further amendment.

906
01:14:24,409 --> 01:14:34,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Must be 60 days ago, 75 days ago now, we requested from the administration a breakdown of the claims over accounts 5761 and 5762 outlined in our Warren articles.

907
01:14:38,493 --> 01:14:47,818
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a discussion relative to the fact that claims over a certain dollar figure, I believe it was $2,500, were required to come by this council if there were settlements and not legal judgments.

908
01:14:48,318 --> 01:15:01,565
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Mr. President, we still have not received that report as to what the breakdown of these claims over consists of and whether or not any of these payments were judgments or settlements that were voluntarily entered into.

909
01:15:04,863 --> 01:15:08,666
[SPEAKER_08]: If we want to talk about transparency, then let's talk about where the money's at.

910
01:15:08,786 --> 01:15:10,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's follow the buck and let's see what's going on.

911
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:26,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what the secret is, but I'm interested in getting to the bottom of an itemized breakdown of those two accounts so that I can better understand the inordinate number of expenditures that have gone out of that account.

912
01:15:26,578 --> 01:15:33,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I'm not saying there's any wrongdoing going on, but what I am saying is that based upon the dollar figures that have been expended from those accounts, that's a lot of $2,400 settlements.

913
01:15:35,528 --> 01:15:36,809
[SPEAKER_08]: that don't have to come before this council.

914
01:15:38,089 --> 01:15:41,991
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's information, I think, that's very necessary for us, Mr. President, moving forward.

915
01:15:43,211 --> 01:15:48,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I would also like to add that as an amendment for- Well, a B paper is an amendment.

916
01:15:49,074 --> 01:15:49,774
[SPEAKER_08]: A B paper is fine.

917
01:15:49,794 --> 01:15:50,894
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a further request.

918
01:15:51,295 --> 01:15:52,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I'll offer it as an amendment.

919
01:15:52,995 --> 01:15:56,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's an issue that we've ever voted against in the past, and I don't anticipate we'll vote against it again.

920
01:15:57,521 --> 01:15:59,842
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking for financial accountability and transparency.

921
01:15:59,942 --> 01:16:04,923
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think any member of this board is going to vote against that, because every member of this board speaks on that.

922
01:16:04,983 --> 01:16:05,523
[SPEAKER_08]: They're for that.

923
01:16:05,563 --> 01:16:06,923
[SPEAKER_08]: We represent that, Mr. President.

924
01:16:07,424 --> 01:16:15,226
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I'll offer it as an amendment, and I will ask for, again, a second time, an itemized breakdown of accounts numbers 5761 and 5762 claims over.

925
01:16:18,242 --> 01:16:18,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

926
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:19,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Belko.

927
01:16:19,882 --> 01:16:23,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello, and I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing that forward.

928
01:16:23,183 --> 01:16:25,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important that we get more detail.

929
01:16:26,504 --> 01:16:35,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I did notice that same thing, that the items in those accounts are rather large, and we haven't seen any particular breakdown with regard to those items.

930
01:16:35,365 --> 01:16:37,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thank him for bringing that forward.

931
01:16:38,546 --> 01:16:41,186
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello, I just wanted to ask you really quick.

932
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:44,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So with your amendment, is that specifically an update

933
01:16:46,012 --> 01:16:51,195
[SPEAKER_06]: for current spend for this fiscal year, meaning since July.

934
01:16:51,275 --> 01:16:59,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say we're on our second year, but an update of our legal costs, including what we're paying for the acting

935
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:10,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Solicitor Scanlon, and we're paying, if I'm not mistaken, I think during the budget hearings, I think we were paying KP a $5,000 a month.

936
01:17:10,864 --> 01:17:11,564
[SPEAKER_04]: You are correct.

937
01:17:11,724 --> 01:17:17,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Stipend, and then anything over and above would be an a la carte item.

938
01:17:17,327 --> 01:17:20,548
[SPEAKER_10]: So where are we with our legal costs?

939
01:17:20,868 --> 01:17:22,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of clarification?

940
01:17:22,329 --> 01:17:22,849
[SPEAKER_08]: At the date.

941
01:17:23,029 --> 01:17:26,751
[SPEAKER_08]: We also, I believe, funded a solicitor's position and an assistant city solicitor's position.

942
01:17:26,891 --> 01:17:29,612
[SPEAKER_08]: So we funded two positions, one of which has gone vacant for a year.

943
01:17:29,632 --> 01:17:29,972
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

944
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:30,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, correct.

945
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:31,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

946
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:58,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Council marks Okay, um on the motion by Council Falco seconded by vice president night as amended by president caraviello and amended again by vice president night My quick take it on so mr.. Clark, please call the roll Council beers yes council Falco yes vice president night I

947
01:17:59,300 --> 01:17:59,860

01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:00,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

949
01:18:01,081 --> 01:18:01,742
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell?

950
01:18:02,363 --> 01:18:02,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

951
01:18:03,864 --> 01:18:04,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli?

952
01:18:04,664 --> 01:18:04,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

953
01:18:05,245 --> 01:18:05,945
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello?

954
01:18:05,965 --> 01:18:06,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

955
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:06,986
[SPEAKER_10]: 7 in the affirmative.

956
01:18:07,006 --> 01:18:08,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

957
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:11,270
[SPEAKER_10]: 2 1 0 5 3 offered by Councilor Falco.

958
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:17,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the City Council enact a housing stability notification ordinance

959
01:18:18,543 --> 01:18:39,248
[SPEAKER_10]: The purpose of the ordinance of this nature is to require property owners who serve residential tenants with an eviction notice, commonly called a notice to quit or a non-renewal of lease, also serve upon the tenant a document called Notice of Tenants' Rights and Resources.

960
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:41,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

961
01:18:50,765 --> 01:18:54,908
[SPEAKER_06]: of so many, the pandemic has caused significant financial hardship to so many.

962
01:18:55,909 --> 01:18:58,131
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the basic needs of all people is for housing.

963
01:18:58,632 --> 01:19:03,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And for so many, this basic need has been undetermined by the possibility of eviction.

964
01:19:04,832 --> 01:19:10,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Among the attempts to address this need have included the state's pause on evictions that expired on October 7, 2020.

965
01:19:12,278 --> 01:19:19,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the CDC, Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, established a federal moratorium on residential evictions that I believe will expire on March 31, 2021.

966
01:19:20,825 --> 01:19:34,055
[SPEAKER_06]: The purpose of my resolution is to prompt a City Council discussion with an eye on passing an ordinance requiring property owners who are serving tenants an eviction notice to include with it a notice of tenants' rights and resources.

967
01:19:35,828 --> 01:19:42,410
[SPEAKER_06]: This type of notice would include a description of the various rights of tenants and a list of resources that they may be able to utilize.

968
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:48,771
[SPEAKER_06]: All too often, tenants are unaware of their rights and do not know that there are resources available to them.

969
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:53,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Stability requires many things, but first among them is knowledge.

970
01:19:55,133 --> 01:20:03,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I ask the council to support this resolution and to focus on a discussion of this subject at a committee of the whole meeting or a subcommittee meeting.

971
01:20:05,237 --> 01:20:05,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I move approval.

972
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:06,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

973
01:20:06,758 --> 01:20:07,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Best.

974
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

975
01:20:09,959 --> 01:20:12,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd just like to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward.

976
01:20:12,381 --> 01:20:18,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a fantastic idea, something that we really should be doing, making sure that people know their rights.

977
01:20:19,824 --> 01:20:29,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to, as the Chair of Elderly Affairs and Housing Subcommittee, to have it there or in Committee of the Whole, whatever Councilor Falco's preference is.

978
01:20:29,829 --> 01:20:30,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

979
01:20:30,329 --> 01:20:31,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Best.

980
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:31,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell.

981
01:20:32,896 --> 01:20:33,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

982
01:20:33,696 --> 01:20:36,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward.

983
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:46,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree this is very important, and I have seen in surrounding communities that they always ensure that these notices are translated in a number of applicable languages.

984
01:20:46,183 --> 01:20:51,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's to be discussed as this goes to subcommittee or committee of the whole, but I just want to note that.

985
01:20:51,645 --> 01:20:52,165
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

986
01:20:52,466 --> 01:20:53,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor.

987
01:20:53,446 --> 01:20:56,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco, where would you prefer this go to?

988
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:59,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I second Councilor Labear's motion to send it to Elderly and Housing Affairs.

989
01:20:59,749 --> 01:21:00,970
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to go to the subcommittee?

990
01:21:02,675 --> 01:21:03,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Subcommittee in housing.

991
01:21:04,809 --> 01:21:05,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Subcommittee in...

992
01:21:06,531 --> 01:21:09,253
[SPEAKER_10]: housing, okay, which Councilor Bears is the chairman of.

993
01:21:10,214 --> 01:21:12,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, any further discussion on this?

994
01:21:12,496 --> 01:21:13,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

995
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:13,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Locks.

996
01:21:14,298 --> 01:21:15,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

997
01:21:15,098 --> 01:21:17,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Falco for offering this.

998
01:21:18,221 --> 01:21:29,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week, the Office of Community Development held a housing planning meeting, of which yourself and I attended, as well as many stakeholders in the community.

999
01:21:30,651 --> 01:21:34,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And we got together for an hour and a half and put together a list of

1000
01:21:34,955 --> 01:21:44,103
[SPEAKER_11]: priorities for housing stability and other housing needs in the community, and of which notification ordinance was one of them.

1001
01:21:44,143 --> 01:21:53,911
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to thank my council colleague for taking one of the items potentially off the laundry list of housing needs in our community.

1002
01:21:54,611 --> 01:22:01,237
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that'll go a long way to notifying tenants of their rights in this community, Mr. President.

1003
01:22:02,037 --> 01:22:02,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1004
01:22:02,378 --> 01:22:03,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Council Members.

1005
01:22:03,138 --> 01:22:03,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further questions?

1006
01:22:05,645 --> 01:22:08,088
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

1007
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:10,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1008
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:16,797
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was Councilor Behr's motion to send this to the subcommittee on housing.

1009
01:22:18,759 --> 01:22:21,201
[SPEAKER_10]: And Councilor Knight seconded.

1010
01:22:21,502 --> 01:22:22,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1011
01:22:27,848 --> 01:22:28,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

1012
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:29,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1013
01:22:30,051 --> 01:22:30,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco?

1014
01:22:30,871 --> 01:22:31,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1015
01:22:31,592 --> 01:22:32,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight?

1016
01:22:32,352 --> 01:22:33,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1017
01:22:33,313 --> 01:22:33,933

[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1019
01:22:34,934 --> 01:22:35,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell?

1020
01:22:36,274 --> 01:22:36,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1021
01:22:37,175 --> 01:22:37,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1022
01:22:38,075 --> 01:22:38,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1023
01:22:38,576 --> 01:22:39,316
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello?

1024
01:22:39,556 --> 01:22:39,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1025
01:22:39,816 --> 01:22:41,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven affirmative, motion passes.

1026
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:56,106
[SPEAKER_10]: 21054 offered by Councilor Falco being resolved that the City Council be provided an update from the administration as to the home rule petition approved by the City Council September regarding a Charter Commission.

1027
01:22:56,366 --> 01:22:57,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco?

1028
01:22:58,156 --> 01:22:59,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1029
01:22:59,377 --> 01:23:00,997
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a simple request.

1030
01:23:01,037 --> 01:23:05,600
[SPEAKER_06]: We passed the home rule petition on September 22nd, 2020.

1031
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:16,265
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd just like to get an update as to if the administration could basically provide an update as to the progress of the home rule petition.

1032
01:23:16,285 --> 01:23:21,007
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they could provide the following, the date that it was signed by the mayor.

1033
01:23:23,562 --> 01:23:28,526
[SPEAKER_06]: the data was sent to the State House, and who the home rule petition was sent to.

1034
01:23:30,788 --> 01:23:34,631
[SPEAKER_06]: If the administration could please update us on those matters, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1035
01:23:34,651 --> 01:23:37,333
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1036
01:23:37,393 --> 01:23:38,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion?

1037
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:40,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk.

1038
01:23:40,836 --> 01:23:42,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I ask Councilor Falco a question?

1039
01:23:42,677 --> 01:23:43,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

1040
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:46,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco, are you amending that to ask those specific questions?

1041
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:46,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1042
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:47,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

1043
01:23:47,741 --> 01:23:48,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you get that, Mr. Clerk?

1044
01:23:48,722 --> 01:23:49,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Got it, yep.

1045
01:23:49,602 --> 01:23:50,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1046
01:23:51,284 --> 01:23:52,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

1047
01:23:52,084 --> 01:23:52,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1048
01:23:54,534 --> 01:24:06,319
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can also get an update from our state delegation, where this particular request, home rule petition stands as well, so we can hear directly from our state delegation as well.

1049
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:07,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1050
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:08,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

1051
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:09,400
[SPEAKER_11]: So moved.

1052
01:24:12,001 --> 01:24:13,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1053
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:19,004
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm treating Councilor Marks as the second amendment.

1054
01:24:22,852 --> 01:24:23,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

1055
01:24:24,253 --> 01:24:24,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1056
01:24:24,973 --> 01:24:25,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

1057
01:24:26,434 --> 01:24:26,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1058
01:24:27,215 --> 01:24:27,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

1059
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:28,596
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1060
01:24:29,196 --> 01:24:29,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

1061
01:24:30,457 --> 01:24:30,717
Yes.

1062
01:24:31,298 --> 01:24:31,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

1063
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:32,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1064
01:24:33,379 --> 01:24:34,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1065
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:34,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1066
01:24:35,058 --> 01:24:36,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, President Caraviello.

1067
01:24:36,459 --> 01:24:39,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'm going to defer a minute as amended.

1068
01:24:40,684 --> 01:24:48,591
[SPEAKER_10]: 21055 offered by President Caraviello, whereas the Medford City Council has an appointment to the Hall-Mell Commission that has since expired.

1069
01:24:49,072 --> 01:24:55,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council will no longer be accepting applications for the Hall-Mell Commission after 2-12-21.

1070
01:24:58,947 --> 01:24:59,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Knight.

1071
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:02,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1072
01:25:02,449 --> 01:25:04,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know if you wanted to speak on this.

1073
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:05,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let you speak and then I'll come back.

1074
01:25:06,471 --> 01:25:12,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say that the Hormel Commission's appointment has, the council's appointment to the Hormel Commission has expired for quite some time.

1075
01:25:13,655 --> 01:25:20,459
[SPEAKER_08]: And the council, when the administration changed Mayor Lungo-Koehn, has been soliciting applications.

1076
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:24,941
[SPEAKER_08]: for the past year for individuals seeking to serve on a board or commission.

1077
01:25:25,722 --> 01:25:50,616
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just ask that we would make the request from the city administration to provide us with a copy of any of the letters of intent or interest that her office has received during this year-long process of collecting and soliciting applications for our boards and commissions and provide them with the council so that we can take those applications and give them the proper review in executive session or committee of the whole or whatever process that we decide to undertake to vet them and appoint.

1078
01:25:51,249 --> 01:25:51,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1079
01:25:51,889 --> 01:25:53,830
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, thank you, Councilor Knight.

1080
01:25:54,351 --> 01:25:57,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I think this is the first time we've actually asked for applications.

1081
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:03,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in the past where the City Council have brought applicants to us, we've now been asking for them.

1082
01:26:04,296 --> 01:26:07,817
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say we do have some.

1083
01:26:08,398 --> 01:26:11,559
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, the cutoff date will be 2-12-21.

1084
01:26:11,619 --> 01:26:14,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Would someone like to make that motion?

1085
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:17,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't make a motion.

1086
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:19,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

1087
01:26:20,296 --> 01:26:20,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

1088
01:26:21,799 --> 01:26:30,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Just if I can ask, because when was the original date, if any, that the council asked for applications for this position?

1089
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:42,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have a formal- I think the mayor has had it out there for a while, saying that many, I think it was on her original sheet of council boards and commissions that have since expired.

1090
01:26:43,196 --> 01:26:45,157
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this one has been expired a couple of years.

1091
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:49,940
[SPEAKER_11]: But the mayor hasn't passed anything on to us saying- I haven't got anything that I haven't seen.

1092
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,102
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the applicants that are interested in the council appointment.

1093
01:26:52,362 --> 01:26:53,883
[SPEAKER_10]: We are on receipt of an application.

1094
01:26:56,404 --> 01:26:59,785
[SPEAKER_10]: This council doesn't receive an application for this position.

1095
01:26:59,805 --> 01:27:00,885
[SPEAKER_10]: But not from the administration?

1096
01:27:00,905 --> 01:27:02,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I will check with the administration and see if they have anybody else.

1097
01:27:03,246 --> 01:27:11,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I think it's fair to say that the administration didn't receive any applications based on the one appointment we have to the Hormel Commission.

1098
01:27:11,888 --> 01:27:14,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just respectfully ask that we extend this date.

1099
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:23,112
[SPEAKER_11]: publicly state tonight as a council that we will extend it to X date, whatever we agree upon, for applications.

1100
01:27:23,492 --> 01:27:27,433
[SPEAKER_11]: That way there's no ambiguity, there's no concern.

1101
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:28,713
[SPEAKER_10]: What date would you like to extend it to?

1102
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:35,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm open to any date, I just think this- Okay, the 228, end of the month, last day of the month?

1103
01:27:35,515 --> 01:27:38,016
[SPEAKER_10]: That's following residents a few weeks.

1104
01:27:38,036 --> 01:27:39,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Limited date to 228.

1105
01:27:40,137 --> 01:27:43,758
[SPEAKER_11]: And the application should be submitted to the council president or vice president.

1106
01:27:44,852 --> 01:27:45,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

1107
01:27:45,373 --> 01:27:45,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1108
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what we've done in the past.

1109
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:47,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1110
01:27:48,535 --> 01:27:52,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, uh, expressing interest in the Hormel, uh, position.

1111
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1112
01:27:54,841 --> 01:27:58,605
[SPEAKER_08]: To that point, Mr. President, if I may, vice president, I can appreciate what Councilor Marks coming from.

1113
01:27:58,885 --> 01:28:09,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I think it's important to point out that because the Hormel commission was, um, something that was established by way of a statute through a home rule petition when we did the land transfer to get the land over there.

1114
01:28:10,235 --> 01:28:15,199
[SPEAKER_08]: The way that the commission is structured is statutory through the home rule petition.

1115
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And the mayor has two appointments and the council has one.

1116
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:34,334
[SPEAKER_08]: So while the mayor may not have received any applicants for individuals that wanted to serve as the council appointee, she may have received applicants for individuals that wanted to serve in the mayoral appointee positions that remain filled still within the term limit.

1117
01:28:35,815 --> 01:28:38,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I thought it might make sense for us to get those applications as well.

1118
01:28:46,907 --> 01:28:52,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Just if we could, I just want to make sure maybe if we could put this on community access to get the message out.

1119
01:28:53,392 --> 01:28:57,355
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have many, other than this meeting, we don't have a lot of ways of getting our message out.

1120
01:28:58,356 --> 01:29:10,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe the city administration on behalf of the council can send it out through their channels that we're interested in someone to serve on this board and commission in the capacity of a commissioner of Hormel.

1121
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:13,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Just trying to think of a couple of ways to get it out there.

1122
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:14,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1123
01:29:15,431 --> 01:29:27,739
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Marks that we extend the application date to 2-28-21 of this year.

1124
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:34,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And amended by me to get the mayor's... And as amended by Councilor Knight to get any applications from the mayor.

1125
01:29:36,025 --> 01:29:43,931
[SPEAKER_12]: And as amended by Councilor Marks to have community access from... And as amended by Councilor Marks for community access advertisements.

1126
01:29:44,911 --> 01:29:47,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1127
01:29:47,992 --> 01:29:48,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

1128
01:29:49,233 --> 01:29:49,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1129
01:29:50,253 --> 01:29:50,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

1130
01:29:51,053 --> 01:29:51,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1131
01:29:52,034 --> 01:29:52,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

1132
01:29:53,094 --> 01:29:53,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1133
01:29:53,975 --> 01:29:54,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

1134
01:29:54,935 --> 01:29:55,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1135
01:29:55,715 --> 01:29:56,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

1136
01:29:56,916 --> 01:29:57,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1137
01:29:57,696 --> 01:29:58,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1138
01:29:58,757 --> 01:29:59,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1139
01:29:59,737 --> 01:30:00,437
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello.

1140
01:30:00,577 --> 01:30:02,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

1141
01:30:02,378 --> 01:30:09,061
[SPEAKER_10]: 2-1-0-5-6, offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved that the Medford City Council and the administration

1142
01:30:12,643 --> 01:30:21,959
[SPEAKER_10]: provide an update on actions taken in response to paper 20581 offered by President Caraviello regarding hazardous waste disposal in our community.

1143
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:22,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

1144
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:29,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for offering paper 20-581 last October.

1145
01:30:30,613 --> 01:30:36,255
[SPEAKER_05]: As many people know, we currently do not have an option for residents to dispose of hazardous waste.

1146
01:30:36,736 --> 01:30:46,520
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not members of the Lexington Consortium, which means that due to COVID-19, residents cannot go to that facility because we are not members.

1147
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:52,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper 20-581 asked for an update and asked for us to join the Lexington Consortium.

1148
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:55,742
[SPEAKER_05]: That was passed unanimously on October 9th, 2020.

1149
01:30:57,102 --> 01:31:02,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Many residents who were asking about it then are still asking about it now.

1150
01:31:02,644 --> 01:31:11,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd just like to get an update from the city administration on what options we are providing to residents for hazardous waste disposal.

1151
01:31:11,906 --> 01:31:12,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1152
01:31:12,586 --> 01:31:12,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1153
01:31:12,986 --> 01:31:14,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bates for bringing this back.

1154
01:31:15,667 --> 01:31:16,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion on this?

1155
01:31:20,328 --> 01:31:23,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by?

1156
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:25,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1157
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:27,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1158
01:31:29,772 --> 01:31:30,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears?

1159
01:31:31,072 --> 01:31:31,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1160
01:31:31,773 --> 01:31:32,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco?

1161
01:31:32,513 --> 01:31:32,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1162
01:31:33,153 --> 01:31:33,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight?

1163
01:31:34,514 --> 01:31:34,734
Yes.

1164
01:31:35,254 --> 01:31:35,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks?

1165
01:31:36,134 --> 01:31:36,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1166
01:31:36,814 --> 01:31:37,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell?

1167
01:31:38,135 --> 01:31:38,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1168
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:39,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1169
01:31:40,296 --> 01:31:40,476
Yes.

1170
01:31:40,756 --> 01:31:41,496
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello?

1171
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:41,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1172
01:31:41,936 --> 01:31:43,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

1173
01:31:45,457 --> 01:32:12,091
[SPEAKER_10]: 21057 offered by Councilor Morell and Councilor Bears, whereas commercial grade gas leaf blowers directly emit air pollutants, including carbon monoxide, which contributes to ground level ozone, nitrous oxides, which contribute to smog formation, hydrocarbons, which can be carcinogenic in nitrous oxides, and whereas commercial grade gas leaf blowers can operate at high decibels,

1174
01:32:13,268 --> 01:32:28,236
[SPEAKER_10]: levels harmful to hearing and health of users and nearby residents, and whereas commercial-grade gas leaf blowers launch particulates and potentially hazardous materials into the air at a rate of over 150 miles per hour.

1175
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:38,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, therefore, be it so resolved that the city council request that the city solicitor draft language to establish an ordinance around commercial-grade leaf blower use within the city

1176
01:32:40,153 --> 01:32:44,154
[SPEAKER_10]: in the interest of public safety for Medford residents.

1177
01:32:44,454 --> 01:32:45,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell.

1178
01:32:45,294 --> 01:32:47,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1179
01:32:47,675 --> 01:32:52,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to read off a few stats in addition to what was worded in the resolution itself.

1180
01:32:53,216 --> 01:33:03,758
[SPEAKER_09]: So the amount of carbon monoxide emitted from a typical backpack leaf blower for just one hour is equal to the amount of carbon monoxide coming from the tailpipe of a car operating for over eight hours.

1181
01:33:04,518 --> 01:33:07,820
[SPEAKER_09]: that's going to be a lot of dust and particles in the air.

1182
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:22,951
[SPEAKER_09]: The floors push 300 to 700 cubic feet of air per minute at speeds of 150 to 280 miles per hour with the resulting dust containing particles that can include pollen, mold, animal feces, heavy metals, break lining powder and chemicals from herbicides and pesticides.

1183
01:33:24,012 --> 01:33:25,593
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the user of a leaf blower, the noise

1184
01:33:32,061 --> 01:33:36,103
[SPEAKER_09]: a lover that has been demonstrated to trigger increases in blood pressure and heart rates.

1185
01:33:37,264 --> 01:33:51,190
[SPEAKER_09]: So these stats stand on their own, but the main reason I introduced this resolution is that I've heard from countless residents over the constant onslaught of leaf blowers year round with really, the only time these machines aren't being used is when there's snow on the ground.

1186
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:52,711
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a little bit of respite right now.

1187
01:33:53,471 --> 01:34:01,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And these residents aren't reaching out because they're disturbed by a leaf blower for an hour when the neighbor's yard crew comes because

1188
01:34:01,617 --> 01:34:07,980
[SPEAKER_09]: they spend hours a day listening to yard crews that sometimes have three leaf blowers going at a time.

1189
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:10,581
[SPEAKER_09]: We know how big our lots are in Medford.

1190
01:34:10,601 --> 01:34:15,283
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not that big, but I think they require three people simultaneously using a leaf blower.

1191
01:34:16,323 --> 01:34:25,287
[SPEAKER_09]: And this, of course, is all happening while people are working remotely, while students are trying to learn remotely, while people are trying to sleep after working the night shift.

1192
01:34:25,871 --> 01:34:30,235
[SPEAKER_09]: And also we spend a lot of our meetings talking about a respiratory disease that has gripped the world.

1193
01:34:30,495 --> 01:34:37,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of these issues contribute to respiratory issues are exasperated by this gas-powered liquor use.

1194
01:34:38,561 --> 01:34:43,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not naive to the fact that I understand that sometimes this can be a controversial thing to raise.

1195
01:34:43,766 --> 01:34:49,030
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I'm asking for here is to send this to the Environmental Affairs Subcommittee so that it can be studied.

1196
01:34:49,483 --> 01:35:13,403
[SPEAKER_09]: you can hear from residents, people that would be affected by this, and look at, you know, regulations that are working in places like Arlington, Cambridge, Newton, and Brookline, and also look at other things that may exist, whether there's grant opportunities for incentivization for transitioning to electric leaf blowers, which are much less, obviously, you don't have the emissions, they're much quieter, and they operate in a slightly lower

1197
01:35:13,823 --> 01:35:14,223
[SPEAKER_09]: speed.

1198
01:35:14,363 --> 01:35:20,166
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm asking to move this to subcommittee to really work on this and see what's something that can work for as many people as possible.

1199
01:35:20,967 --> 01:35:23,008
[SPEAKER_09]: But I cede to Councilor Bears.

1200
01:35:23,488 --> 01:35:26,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Second the Councilor's motion to refer to the subcommittee, Mr. President.

1201
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:28,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears.

1202
01:35:29,111 --> 01:35:29,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1203
01:35:30,052 --> 01:35:32,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, Councilor Morell for taking the lead on this.

1204
01:35:33,934 --> 01:35:35,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you really captured it.

1205
01:35:35,174 --> 01:35:39,597
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I think it's on us as the city government to figure out reasonable

1206
01:35:40,426 --> 01:35:43,047
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, regulations around this issue.

1207
01:35:43,228 --> 01:35:55,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been hearing about it a lot as well from residents before the pandemic and especially now during the pandemic with people at home trying to do their job or trying to learn at school.

1208
01:35:56,335 --> 01:35:58,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I think we can find

1209
01:35:58,756 --> 01:36:12,420
[SPEAKER_05]: a reasonable approach that really provides relief to residents who are, you know, dealing with leaf blowers and can address this so that we can have a safer and healthier community going forward.

1210
01:36:12,841 --> 01:36:13,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1211
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:14,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilman.

1212
01:36:14,041 --> 01:36:14,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1213
01:36:15,401 --> 01:36:16,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1214
01:36:16,302 --> 01:36:19,243
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I saw this resolution, I,

1215
01:36:21,398 --> 01:36:41,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the privilege and ability to work with facilities management and I did some homework and I reached out to the neighboring communities and talked to DPW commissioners and assistant commissioners and facilities managers.

1216
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:52,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, if it was that simple, this could be an easy resolution or to find a solution for this issue.

1217
01:36:53,175 --> 01:36:54,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it isn't.

1218
01:36:55,955 --> 01:36:57,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the noise first.

1219
01:36:57,596 --> 01:37:09,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I got back from the information, in using the DPW, our DPW as an example, the leaf blowers they use emit a decimals

1220
01:37:12,003 --> 01:37:14,405
[SPEAKER_02]: for noise at 100, 110.

1221
01:37:15,225 --> 01:37:22,850
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaf blowers that are electric by this study has shown that it reaches between 90 and 92.

1222
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:29,014
[SPEAKER_02]: What that is equivalent to, as they told me, is the difference of a whisper.

1223
01:37:30,698 --> 01:37:39,884
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest issue is something that concerns me, is when we're trying to talk about the environment and look at the carbon footprint.

1224
01:37:40,545 --> 01:37:50,972
[SPEAKER_02]: What we don't have in place yet in this country, we haven't put anything in place about what happens to battery powered blowers for the batteries that are going to be needed.

1225
01:37:51,892 --> 01:37:55,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And for what the study that's already done in neighboring communities to show that

1226
01:37:57,195 --> 01:38:03,120
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of battery life would be eight batteries per day per employee.

1227
01:38:04,701 --> 01:38:07,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And those batteries then would need to- Point of information, Mr. President.

1228
01:38:07,724 --> 01:38:09,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Councilor Morell.

1229
01:38:10,626 --> 01:38:11,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1230
01:38:11,247 --> 01:38:13,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I wasn't clear in this.

1231
01:38:13,268 --> 01:38:19,734
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something I'm looking, I think looking at private lots, I understand the need of DPW and larger scale.

1232
01:38:20,234 --> 01:38:24,458
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to clarify that looking at, you know, private use for this kind of stuff, private lots.

1233
01:38:25,538 --> 01:38:25,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1234
01:38:26,138 --> 01:38:44,883
[SPEAKER_02]: So in private use, you're asking private landscapers and private businesses now to look and retrofit their vehicles to a charging system that is very expensive, that would then take eight batteries per employee to be used, that would only last for two years.

1235
01:38:45,703 --> 01:38:51,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I've been told is that the carbon footprint could increase

1236
01:38:53,115 --> 01:39:01,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the system has not set up a place or a system to eliminate these batteries.

1237
01:39:01,181 --> 01:39:09,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like when we talk about car batteries and we talk about electric cars, there are systems in place to eliminate and discard those batteries.

1238
01:39:10,127 --> 01:39:15,971
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't yet figured out what to do with the batteries when it comes to lawn blowers, believe it or not.

1239
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:24,830
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many variables, and I appreciate and I think that once it goes to subcommittee, these are issues that have to be brought up.

1240
01:39:25,311 --> 01:39:39,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you talk about just having the private sector being focused on, the word that's come back is that if we allow the public sector to use these leaf blowers,

1241
01:39:40,178 --> 01:39:46,960
[SPEAKER_02]: but not the private sector, it leaves us out there for a huge issue of bias.

1242
01:39:47,040 --> 01:40:01,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's the case, I know that a neighboring community is looking at $500,000 to retrofit their DPW trucks and purchasing of equipment that's needed to run their communities.

1243
01:40:01,965 --> 01:40:09,668
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to be cautious that both the noise and the noise level,

1244
01:40:10,858 --> 01:40:29,576
[SPEAKER_02]: could be argued, but I think what's most important when you talk about the carbon footprint, and neighboring communities that have been focused on this issue wholeheartedly, and they've been researching this, it's a slippery slope because of the lack of...

1245
01:40:32,006 --> 01:40:38,015
[SPEAKER_02]: planning when it comes to disposal of the batteries that will only last for two years.

1246
01:40:38,615 --> 01:40:46,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just caution everybody, I support sending this to subcommittee, but I also would recommend that

1247
01:40:47,628 --> 01:40:53,597
[SPEAKER_02]: We make a few phone calls to neighbor communities that have already put this in place and are trying to put this in place that are sitting.

1248
01:40:54,278 --> 01:41:00,587
[SPEAKER_02]: One community has pushed something through, another community is now with their city solicitor trying to understand what's happening.

1249
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:12,053
[SPEAKER_02]: When I spoke to those people in neighboring communities, it seemed like our resolution is very similar to theirs, which is pretty impressive that we're looking at the same issue.

1250
01:41:12,093 --> 01:41:24,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would second the motion to send this to subcommittee, but I also urge us to be very careful in understanding the impact this is going to make negatively not only

1251
01:41:26,478 --> 01:41:34,025
[SPEAKER_02]: through our carbon initiative, but also our financial responsibilities and our legal responsibilities.

1252
01:41:34,045 --> 01:41:34,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1253
01:41:35,206 --> 01:41:36,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Constable.

1254
01:41:36,146 --> 01:41:36,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Knight.

1255
01:41:37,407 --> 01:41:47,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, yes, as I read through this, you know, it sounds like the intent of the ordinance is to replace gas powered leaf blowers.

1256
01:41:49,043 --> 01:41:52,445
[SPEAKER_08]: or eliminate the use of leaf blowers entirely in our community.

1257
01:41:53,706 --> 01:42:01,691
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look at the resolution, commercial grade gas leaf blowers can operate at high decibel levels, harmful to the hearing.

1258
01:42:01,731 --> 01:42:04,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Councilor Scott probably has presented us with some data to that effect.

1259
01:42:04,673 --> 01:42:07,815
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, wouldn't an electric blower

1260
01:42:09,051 --> 01:42:14,176
[SPEAKER_08]: perform the same exact impact if, you know, we have data that says that it's only a WISPA.

1261
01:42:14,236 --> 01:42:20,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, commercial grade glass leaf blowers launch particulates and hazardous materials into the air at a rate of over 150 miles an hour.

1262
01:42:20,862 --> 01:42:22,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And the councilor went through a list of those things.

1263
01:42:23,225 --> 01:42:25,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I think- What information- Sorry to interrupt you.

1264
01:42:25,967 --> 01:42:28,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I did forget that because gas

1265
01:42:30,343 --> 01:42:38,050
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a difference between gas and electric, you would have to double your time used with electric blowers in comparison to gas blowers.

1266
01:42:38,370 --> 01:42:49,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want the residents to realize, you might not like the landscaper to be out there for a half hour, but if we do make this happen, that's going to be buzzing for an hour.

1267
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how they explained it to me.

1268
01:42:51,402 --> 01:42:52,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize, Mr. Chairman.

1269
01:42:53,807 --> 01:43:07,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President, that's what I was getting at, was that I think gas and electric blowers are going to have the same effect and the same impact when it comes to the blowing of particulates and the decibel levels of noise.

1270
01:43:08,374 --> 01:43:15,577
[SPEAKER_08]: But the question I ask, I guess, is that the intent to eliminate just gas-powered leaf blowers or all leaf blowers in our community?

1271
01:43:16,152 --> 01:43:16,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one.

1272
01:43:16,592 --> 01:43:21,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, I think it's important to point out the people that are using these gas blowers are working too.

1273
01:43:21,594 --> 01:43:32,138
[SPEAKER_08]: So while someone might be trying to work from home because they're fortunate enough to have a desk job, there's an individual that's out there, a blue collar worker that's using a leaf blower, and I don't think they're using it for their health.

1274
01:43:32,358 --> 01:43:35,079
[SPEAKER_08]: They're using it as a means to provide for their family.

1275
01:43:35,959 --> 01:43:39,780
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess the question is, is the intent to eliminate leaf blowers entirely?

1276
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the intent to eliminate just gas leaf blowers?

1277
01:43:42,961 --> 01:43:44,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is the intent to study the issue?

1278
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:48,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1279
01:43:48,841 --> 01:43:49,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell.

1280
01:43:51,082 --> 01:43:56,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the intent is to study the issue to come out with, you know, common sense regulations that I think work for everyone.

1281
01:43:56,866 --> 01:44:05,992
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that I fail to be specific about is something that's working in other communities is looking at the number of leaf blowers allowed per lot size.

1282
01:44:06,112 --> 01:44:12,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, we have, you know, a 6,000 square foot lot and we have three people running gas powered leaf blowers, I think.

1283
01:44:13,298 --> 01:44:32,150
[SPEAKER_09]: there's somewhere we could meet in the middle there, but I mean, the idea is to study it, to find and hear from the people, hear from the stakeholders in the community, find a way to meet all of, you know, meet as many goals as we can, as far as people having better quality of life, you know, not harming businesses, seeing what we can do here.

1284
01:44:34,176 --> 01:44:35,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Moreau.

1285
01:44:35,156 --> 01:44:35,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bez.

1286
01:44:36,057 --> 01:44:37,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not finished, Mr. President.

1287
01:44:38,517 --> 01:44:39,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1288
01:44:39,237 --> 01:44:41,338
[SPEAKER_10]: The question I asked- Councilor Mayne, can we come back to you?

1289
01:44:41,838 --> 01:44:45,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just asking a question while I had the floor, right?

1290
01:44:45,099 --> 01:44:47,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought you yielded the floor to Councilor Moreau.

1291
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:49,460
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was just asking what the intent was from the sponsor.

1292
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:51,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Moreau, do you want to answer him?

1293
01:44:51,441 --> 01:44:51,761
[SPEAKER_08]: She did.

1294
01:44:51,781 --> 01:44:53,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I have further questions.

1295
01:44:54,822 --> 01:45:00,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I would, Mr. President, I think maybe if the intent is to study the issue, then that's what the paper should say.

1296
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:07,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Because by voting for this, it looks like the council is saying, we're going to eliminate the use of all leaf blowers in the city, and let's send it to the city solicitor to draft an ordinance.

1297
01:45:08,506 --> 01:45:09,887
[SPEAKER_09]: The resolution doesn't say that?

1298
01:45:10,848 --> 01:45:16,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it so resolved, the city council requests that the city solicitor draft language to establish an ordinance around commercial grade leaf blowers.

1299
01:45:16,953 --> 01:45:17,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of sounds like it to me.

1300
01:45:17,833 --> 01:45:17,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1301
01:45:18,314 --> 01:45:18,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1302
01:45:18,394 --> 01:45:18,934
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway.

1303
01:45:18,954 --> 01:45:20,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing about private law team.

1304
01:45:22,377 --> 01:45:22,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1305
01:45:22,897 --> 01:45:23,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1306
01:45:23,438 --> 01:45:28,542
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's important, Mr. President, that maybe we strike the language and replace it with, be it so resolved, that the subcommittee on energy

1307
01:45:29,054 --> 01:45:34,979
[SPEAKER_08]: study the issue of the use of leaf blowers in the community and report back to the council its findings at a committee of the whole.

1308
01:45:34,999 --> 01:45:35,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Morell.

1309
01:45:35,859 --> 01:45:37,501
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd offer that in the form of an amendment to the paper.

1310
01:45:38,181 --> 01:45:38,682
[SPEAKER_08]: As amended.

1311
01:45:40,603 --> 01:45:41,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Morell.

1312
01:45:41,023 --> 01:45:41,844
[SPEAKER_08]: As a strike and replace.

1313
01:45:42,465 --> 01:45:42,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to keep it.

1314
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:44,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want that amendment.

1315
01:45:44,686 --> 01:45:45,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to keep the paper as is.

1316
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:50,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

1317
01:45:50,451 --> 01:45:51,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears is next in line.

1318
01:45:53,607 --> 01:45:54,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1319
01:45:54,907 --> 01:46:05,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I was just going to, when I raised my hand to speak to this exact question, I don't think the intent is here to say we must go all electric and we must ban all gas leaf blowers.

1320
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:14,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's specifically that we have commercial grade leaf blower use in the community, as it says in the ordinance, sorry, in the resolution, and then we should establish an ordinance around that.

1321
01:46:15,092 --> 01:46:23,340
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, you know, I think to Councilor Scarpelli's point could be about the manner in which gas leak floors are allowed to be used or not, right?

1322
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we do need to have a study on the issue.

1323
01:46:25,762 --> 01:46:35,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we do understand, you know, that there are a variety of stakeholders with a variety of concerns, but the intent, at least when I signed on to this, and I believe Councilor Morell just said it too,

1324
01:46:36,172 --> 01:46:46,518
[SPEAKER_05]: to say we are going all electric and we're banning gas leaf blowers, but to say, are there time and manner restrictions that we might want to have in place to reduce the burden on our community?

1325
01:46:48,859 --> 01:46:55,282
[SPEAKER_05]: No intent here, I believe, from either of us around banning all uses.

1326
01:46:55,582 --> 01:47:01,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Although if we were to study it and come up with that conclusion, maybe that would be interesting.

1327
01:47:01,526 --> 01:47:03,607
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just where I'm coming from on this.

1328
01:47:04,387 --> 01:47:08,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So in response, Mr. President, I think it's important.

1329
01:47:09,091 --> 01:47:11,133
[SPEAKER_08]: We should be asking for what we want, right?

1330
01:47:11,393 --> 01:47:12,754
[SPEAKER_08]: We want the issue to be studied.

1331
01:47:12,795 --> 01:47:14,096
[SPEAKER_08]: We're saying the issue needs to be studied.

1332
01:47:14,576 --> 01:47:24,165
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know whether or not creating a draft ordinance or draft language around commercial grade leaf blower use is in the best interest of this community because it hasn't been studied.

1333
01:47:24,645 --> 01:47:31,371
[SPEAKER_08]: And we talk about due diligence and we talk about vetting quite a bit when we are being critical of the person that sits in the corner office across the hall.

1334
01:47:31,758 --> 01:47:36,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that if we're going to be that critical of others, we should be holding ourselves to the same standard, Mr. President.

1335
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:44,541
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so with that being said, I mean, I don't think it makes sense for us to draft an ordinance that we haven't studied yet.

1336
01:47:46,202 --> 01:47:46,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information?

1337
01:47:47,222 --> 01:47:49,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Councilor Scott Belli.

1338
01:47:49,363 --> 01:47:51,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight, is that a motion or an amendment?

1339
01:47:52,638 --> 01:47:55,965
[SPEAKER_08]: strike and replace with be it so resolved by the Subcommittee of Energy.

1340
01:47:55,985 --> 01:47:58,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I would second that motion Mr. President.

1341
01:47:58,870 --> 01:48:00,774
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a vote on the previous motion.

1342
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:05,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1343
01:48:06,592 --> 01:48:07,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1344
01:48:07,612 --> 01:48:16,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to understand what I'm voting on because I think it was mentioned that this would not apply to city-owned property.

1345
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:27,790
[SPEAKER_11]: And if that's the case, Mr. President, how do we tell the hundreds of residents in the community that may live next to city-owned property that gets mowed very frequently

1346
01:48:28,450 --> 01:48:51,557
[SPEAKER_11]: that their leaf blowers that are being used by the city are not causing pollutants, including carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide, or their leaf blowers don't operate at high decibel levels next to their homes, or their leaf blowers don't launch particulates, potentially hazardous to materials.

1347
01:48:51,998 --> 01:48:53,158
[SPEAKER_11]: So are we going to discount

1348
01:48:53,658 --> 01:48:57,781
[SPEAKER_11]: hundreds of residents and say this only applies on private lots.

1349
01:48:58,422 --> 01:49:00,764
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what we're going after, Mr. President, on this.

1350
01:49:01,144 --> 01:49:06,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if we're going to look into something, I think we should look into it as a whole, Mr. President.

1351
01:49:07,148 --> 01:49:19,358
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we're going to look into issues of particulates and air pollutants, I can tell you that my lawnmower probably sends out as much particulates and pollution as a gas blower does.

1352
01:49:19,678 --> 01:49:23,281
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can tell you that my snow blower does the same thing, Mr. President.

1353
01:49:24,262 --> 01:49:27,105
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just don't know where we're going with the issue.

1354
01:49:27,165 --> 01:49:30,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this just because other communities have implemented it?

1355
01:49:31,390 --> 01:49:36,756
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have noise ordinances within this community that regulate noise levels and decimal levels.

1356
01:49:37,016 --> 01:49:42,221
[SPEAKER_11]: We just had an issue with Spring Staff about playing loud music at 11, 12 o'clock at night.

1357
01:49:42,722 --> 01:49:44,483
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're trying to resolve, Mr. President.

1358
01:49:44,764 --> 01:49:48,306
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are means in this community to address these issues.

1359
01:49:48,767 --> 01:49:55,112
[SPEAKER_11]: If the issue is that we want to address these during certain hours of the day or the frequency, then fine.

1360
01:49:55,152 --> 01:49:59,315
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we should be more specific on what the intent is, Mr. President.

1361
01:50:00,036 --> 01:50:00,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do.

1362
01:50:00,996 --> 01:50:06,801
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we're really interested in these issues, how do you discount people that live next door to a park?

1363
01:50:07,561 --> 01:50:08,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like someone to address that.

1364
01:50:10,224 --> 01:50:11,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Watson.

1365
01:50:11,505 --> 01:50:12,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell.

1366
01:50:12,854 --> 01:50:13,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1367
01:50:13,835 --> 01:50:16,076
[SPEAKER_09]: To Council Mark's points, I'm happy to have that folded in.

1368
01:50:16,096 --> 01:50:26,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that is reason, I guess I would agree now with the amendment to make this study and report back out to the council because it seems that we shouldn't limit it.

1369
01:50:27,622 --> 01:50:30,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm happy to have all of these things on the table to study.

1370
01:50:31,544 --> 01:50:37,827
[SPEAKER_11]: But you just also alluded to the fact that you meant to put in there, this was only private lots.

1371
01:50:39,523 --> 01:50:39,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

1372
01:50:39,743 --> 01:50:40,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you just say that to me?

1373
01:50:40,484 --> 01:50:46,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe we're having a discussion right now and I'm happy to adjust based on the very valid points that councilors have raised.

1374
01:50:46,567 --> 01:50:49,189
[SPEAKER_11]: You just flip-flopped on the issue twice already on this.

1375
01:50:49,929 --> 01:50:53,311
[SPEAKER_11]: You said it was private lots and now you're saying you're happy to have the conversation.

1376
01:50:53,572 --> 01:50:55,033
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all we're saying as a council.

1377
01:50:55,373 --> 01:50:58,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's look at this and try to address the needs.

1378
01:50:59,155 --> 01:51:00,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we can't go back and forth flip-flopping.

1379
01:51:01,116 --> 01:51:05,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I believe that's why I introduced the resolution so that we could look at this and discuss this.

1380
01:51:06,922 --> 01:51:07,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1381
01:51:07,883 --> 01:51:09,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion on this?

1382
01:51:09,545 --> 01:51:11,146
[SPEAKER_10]: So can we have clarity, Mr. President?

1383
01:51:11,587 --> 01:51:11,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1384
01:51:11,827 --> 01:51:24,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the, um, the original motion is by Councilor Morell and Councilor Bears to send this to the subcommittee on environmental affairs, which is amended, which was amended by Councilor Knight.

1385
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:28,464
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was denied by the, uh, by Councilor Morell, who was the author of this.

1386
01:51:29,244 --> 01:51:31,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll withdraw that denial if I can.

1387
01:51:32,146 --> 01:51:33,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, hold on.

1388
01:51:33,347 --> 01:51:35,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I can only do one at a time.

1389
01:51:35,948 --> 01:51:41,531
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Council Member, do you want to change this paper or what do you want to do here?

1390
01:51:42,752 --> 01:51:47,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I withdraw my denial to Councilor Knight's amendment and change it so I accept it?

1391
01:51:47,454 --> 01:51:48,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of amendment.

1392
01:51:48,715 --> 01:51:49,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I made an amendment.

1393
01:51:49,395 --> 01:51:51,116
[SPEAKER_08]: She can't say, no, you can't make an amendment.

1394
01:51:51,276 --> 01:51:52,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I made an amendment to get seconded.

1395
01:51:52,517 --> 01:51:53,938
[SPEAKER_09]: The amendment's seconded.

1396
01:51:54,998 --> 01:51:57,520
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it has to be... All right.

1397
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:58,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1398
01:51:59,167 --> 01:51:59,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Other motion?

1399
01:52:00,847 --> 01:52:04,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you just read back the amendment?

1400
01:52:04,148 --> 01:52:15,970
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure that I'm... The motion was to send this to the subcommittee on environmental affairs to look into and come back to the council with a purpose of a study.

1401
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:17,490
[SPEAKER_10]: With a study of recommendations.

1402
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:20,651
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to keep it like that.

1403
01:52:20,871 --> 01:52:21,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I correct?

1404
01:52:21,451 --> 01:52:24,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and also I do know there are people here who want to speak on this as well.

1405
01:52:24,491 --> 01:52:25,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, just so you know, that's not what the

1406
01:52:28,563 --> 01:52:29,324
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not what the resolution says.

1407
01:52:29,344 --> 01:52:31,547
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not what the resolution says, yeah.

1408
01:52:31,647 --> 01:52:33,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought we were discussing an amendment.

1409
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:34,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to amend the paper.

1410
01:52:34,911 --> 01:52:39,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not, I don't understand where Councilor Knight's amendment, I'm being told it's accepted, it's not accepted.

1411
01:52:39,537 --> 01:52:40,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Mark says the floor.

1412
01:52:41,843 --> 01:52:46,386
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk one at a time so we can make an educated and informed decision, Mr. President.

1413
01:52:46,746 --> 01:52:50,348
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to make sure, because the resolution's asking for one thing.

1414
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:55,131
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's an amendment, I want to make sure that amendment is acceptable to all my colleagues, Mr. President.

1415
01:52:55,411 --> 01:53:00,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to make sure that we're talking about apples and not comparing apples to oranges.

1416
01:53:01,054 --> 01:53:07,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we've heard a lot of things go back and forth regarding lots, private lots, city-owned lots being exempt.

1417
01:53:07,578 --> 01:53:09,059
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to make sure we're on the same page.

1418
01:53:10,433 --> 01:53:17,897
[SPEAKER_10]: So Councilor Morell, do you want to go back and self-explain what your motion is here?

1419
01:53:19,737 --> 01:53:19,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1420
01:53:19,978 --> 01:53:24,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't know if the amendment from Councilor Knight still stands or not.

1421
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:26,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight has withdrawn his amendment.

1422
01:53:26,821 --> 01:53:30,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, at this point, I withdraw any and all amendments I've made on this paper.

1423
01:53:30,883 --> 01:53:32,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight has withdrawn his amendment.

1424
01:53:32,703 --> 01:53:39,947
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, the motion was to send it to the Subcommittee on Environmental Affairs, and again,

1425
01:53:41,075 --> 01:53:41,875
[SPEAKER_10]: as it reads here.

1426
01:53:42,536 --> 01:53:47,297
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says- Yes, I'm happy to amend the paper to say for study to report back out to the council.

1427
01:53:47,637 --> 01:53:47,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1428
01:53:48,038 --> 01:53:52,479
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to go to the subcommittee for study for recommendation back to the council.

1429
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:53,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I correct?

1430
01:53:53,139 --> 01:53:53,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1431
01:53:53,659 --> 01:53:53,899
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1432
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have further discussion on that?

1433
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:59,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Needs a second.

1434
01:53:59,321 --> 01:54:00,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody from the public out there want to speak?

1435
01:54:01,562 --> 01:54:02,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Needs a second.

1436
01:54:03,443 --> 01:54:05,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have a second on Councilor Morell's paper?

1437
01:54:06,384 --> 01:54:06,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1438
01:54:06,984 --> 01:54:07,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Bears.

1439
01:54:08,184 --> 01:54:09,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have anybody from the public that would like to speak?

1440
01:54:10,717 --> 01:54:12,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Norman Kaplan has his hand up.

1441
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:13,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see.

1442
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:14,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, where is he?

1443
01:54:20,306 --> 01:54:22,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I see that I've been unmuted.

1444
01:54:22,128 --> 01:54:22,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1445
01:54:23,029 --> 01:54:23,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

1446
01:54:23,489 --> 01:54:24,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

1447
01:54:25,751 --> 01:54:25,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1448
01:54:26,372 --> 01:54:27,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Councilors.

1449
01:54:27,553 --> 01:54:34,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Norman Kaplan, 23 Heathland Way, and for the past seven years with my wife and nine-year-old daughter.

1450
01:54:36,410 --> 01:54:40,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I have voted in every election since moving to Medford seven years ago.

1451
01:54:40,171 --> 01:54:45,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have either met all of you Councilors, or I have at least read your campaign materials.

1452
01:54:46,994 --> 01:54:54,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine months ago, in May of 2020, the Medford Energy and Environment Committee sent a letter signed by all of its members.

1453
01:54:54,736 --> 01:54:55,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It was unanimous.

1454
01:54:55,877 --> 01:55:02,559
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent it to the mayor, and they urged her to impose an emergency moratorium on gasoline-powered leaf blowers.

1455
01:55:03,546 --> 01:55:07,847
[SPEAKER_03]: She read it, and her reply was that the city council should pass an ordinance.

1456
01:55:09,628 --> 01:55:13,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I came here tonight, and this is the first time I've addressed the council.

1457
01:55:14,490 --> 01:55:16,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I come here tonight to urge you to do so.

1458
01:55:17,531 --> 01:55:18,851
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a question.

1459
01:55:18,931 --> 01:55:25,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Do any members of this council drive a motor vehicle that does not have a muffler or a catalytic converter?

1460
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:29,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there's no roll call needed.

1461
01:55:29,675 --> 01:55:30,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure the answer is no.

1462
01:55:32,999 --> 01:55:39,922
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's the case, I have to ask why we have not yet banned the use of these devices.

1463
01:55:40,763 --> 01:55:41,623
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have either.

1464
01:55:41,803 --> 01:55:45,305
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a muffler to suppress the ear-splitting noise.

1465
01:55:46,085 --> 01:55:46,826
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no catalytic converter.

1466
01:55:46,846 --> 01:55:48,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Councilor Scapelli.

1467
01:55:49,327 --> 01:55:58,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Caplan, I can understand your desire to move this forward, but I think that all we're looking at is this might be the solution.

1468
01:55:58,371 --> 01:56:00,773
[SPEAKER_02]: We might look to eliminate the gas blows.

1469
01:56:01,633 --> 01:56:08,057
[SPEAKER_02]: We also did our due diligence and realized that this could negatively affect our carbon footprint in other ways.

1470
01:56:08,077 --> 01:56:09,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all we're saying.

1471
01:56:09,398 --> 01:56:11,979
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not saying that this might not be an option.

1472
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:17,462
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're saying is we just want to look into the process and how it affects in totality.

1473
01:56:17,662 --> 01:56:28,229
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that you seem a little intense that this body is trying to move something that you want to see go forward, that we're not doing that.

1474
01:56:28,269 --> 01:56:30,170
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want to do our due diligence to make sure that

1475
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:36,372
[SPEAKER_02]: there are processes in place so we're not hurting our environment at the same time and changing inordinance.

1476
01:56:36,612 --> 01:56:37,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1477
01:56:37,592 --> 01:56:38,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Congressman.

1478
01:56:38,352 --> 01:56:50,336
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm not mistaken, sir, it was you who said earlier in the first 15 or 20 minutes of this meeting that you placed great faith in listening to your constituents.

1479
01:56:50,997 --> 01:56:53,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I hear you cutting me off after two minutes or less.

1480
01:56:55,875 --> 01:57:01,870
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would hope that you would give me the courtesy of hearing me out on this important issue.

1481
01:57:04,557 --> 01:57:06,018
[SPEAKER_10]: What information has Councilor Scarpelli?

1482
01:57:06,398 --> 01:57:12,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to apologize to Mr. Kaplan because being in the committee meeting, we can't see who's in the meeting or not.

1483
01:57:13,141 --> 01:57:21,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't know if maybe you missed that part because as you're talking about the issues about the environment, that I already said something.

1484
01:57:21,524 --> 01:57:22,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the only reason why.

1485
01:57:23,005 --> 01:57:25,746
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not intended to be disrespectful in any way, sir.

1486
01:57:26,086 --> 01:57:29,147
[SPEAKER_02]: We just, in this forum, I can't see that you're on the call.

1487
01:57:29,227 --> 01:57:29,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize.

1488
01:57:30,790 --> 01:57:31,390
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1489
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:33,511
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no need to apologize.

1490
01:57:34,332 --> 01:57:35,672
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was, it's accepted.

1491
01:57:36,833 --> 01:57:55,862
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also heard while we were talking about COVID-19, I could hear and see all the frustration in the voices and in the faces of all the councils, which is understandable because at the local level, there's very little that you can do to make a real impact.

1492
01:57:57,474 --> 01:57:59,055
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a different situation.

1493
01:57:59,195 --> 01:58:21,500
[SPEAKER_03]: On the local level, you can really make an impact and improve the quality of life of the vast majority of residents of Medford who don't use the devil's hair dryer, as it's known, and don't contract with landscapers who use them.

1494
01:58:24,043 --> 01:58:32,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to talk a little bit because I think there's been some misinformation conveyed here in this meeting.

1495
01:58:32,486 --> 01:58:36,868
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of science involved.

1496
01:58:37,048 --> 01:58:42,570
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't really get down and drill down and study it, it's easy to be misinformed.

1497
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:50,252
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, these devices do not have mufflers or catalytic converters.

1498
01:58:53,590 --> 01:59:09,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just the absence of the mufflers and catalytic converters that distinguishes this equipment from automobiles or trucks or motorcycles, buses, trains, or even the lawnmower or the snowblower.

1499
01:59:09,535 --> 01:59:18,277
[SPEAKER_03]: These machines, these backpack-style tanks, have crude two-stroke engines.

1500
01:59:19,023 --> 01:59:23,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're used by nearly all commercial backpack-style blowers.

1501
01:59:24,347 --> 01:59:25,728
[SPEAKER_03]: They are pollution bombs.

1502
01:59:26,669 --> 01:59:29,691
[SPEAKER_03]: They lack a separate lubrication system.

1503
01:59:29,711 --> 01:59:41,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that means is the fuel tank contains a mixture of gasoline and engine oil, a third of which is spewed out in the exhaust, unburned and suspended in the air.

1504
01:59:42,261 --> 01:59:47,645
[SPEAKER_03]: As Councilor Morell said, there's been studies as to just to compare.

1505
01:59:48,375 --> 01:59:52,657
[SPEAKER_03]: a single two-stroke commercial leaf blower to a vehicle.

1506
01:59:53,138 --> 02:00:06,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Edmunds Automotive did a study, and they found that one two-stroke commercial leaf blower will emit the same pollution in a half an hour as a Ford 150 pickup truck driving 3,900 miles from Texas to Alaska.

1507
02:00:18,742 --> 02:00:26,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And when was the last time you ever saw a landscape crew using one leaf blower per property?

1508
02:00:27,086 --> 02:00:45,955
[SPEAKER_03]: When that landscaper's horse trailer or extended pickup truck arrives on any given beautiful spring morning or warm summer afternoon, it's usually two to three commercial grade leaf blowers that are immediately unloaded onto the sidewalk.

1509
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:49,866
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's usually two or three machines roaring at once.

1510
02:00:50,687 --> 02:00:59,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, most properties in Medford, on our residential landscape,

1511
02:01:00,133 --> 02:01:03,955
[SPEAKER_03]: are what, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 square feet.

1512
02:01:04,415 --> 02:01:12,518
[SPEAKER_03]: You take the building off of that, and you're only talking about a couple of thousand square feet of property.

1513
02:01:14,079 --> 02:01:17,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And another thing, someone mentioned the workers.

1514
02:01:18,461 --> 02:01:25,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we don't want to increase the unemployment among our residents and workers.

1515
02:01:28,562 --> 02:01:52,693
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had taken a look at who the workers are, they're almost always, in fact, I would say a hundred percent, all male, mostly immigrants from Central and South America, who I doubt have the slightest idea of the health risks that they're exposed to while operating these gas and oil-burning two-stroke engines, eight hours a day, six days a week.

1516
02:01:56,355 --> 02:02:03,001
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe that the gentleman is reinforcing our argument that this issue needs to be further studied and examined.

1517
02:02:03,641 --> 02:02:08,045
[SPEAKER_08]: He did state that this is something that needs to be looked at because there's a lot of science involved.

1518
02:02:08,065 --> 02:02:10,187
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to be studied to understand the science.

1519
02:02:10,587 --> 02:02:12,269
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all this council is asking for.

1520
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:20,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we need to go into the demographic makeup of the landscapers and the landscaping crews at this point in time, Mr. President.

1521
02:02:21,517 --> 02:02:24,659
[SPEAKER_08]: What this is was a call for the council to study the issue that's before it.

1522
02:02:24,699 --> 02:02:25,400
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't vote it down.

1523
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:26,520
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't say, no, get rid of this.

1524
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:29,783
[SPEAKER_08]: We said, if you want to draft an ordinance, it needs to be studied first.

1525
02:02:29,843 --> 02:02:33,685
[SPEAKER_08]: And the study report needs to be submitted to the council for further review and discussion.

1526
02:02:34,305 --> 02:02:35,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Bottom line, that was all it was.

1527
02:02:36,087 --> 02:02:38,208
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't like the thing is dead on the vine and it's over.

1528
02:02:38,568 --> 02:02:40,930
[SPEAKER_08]: What it's saying is it's not ripe for the drafting of an ordinance.

1529
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:43,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And we need further information in order for this council to build consensus.

1530
02:02:44,072 --> 02:02:45,773
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way that we can do that is by having a study.

1531
02:02:46,954 --> 02:02:48,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like just to make one further point.

1532
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:57,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, and I think it's the biggest point that was lost in all of this discussion about the leaf blowers, whether they're electric or gasoline.

1533
02:02:58,518 --> 02:03:10,090
[SPEAKER_03]: The seven months between March, mid-March, or the end of March when the landscapers arrive, and mid-October, what are they doing with the leaf blowers?

1534
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:12,913
[SPEAKER_03]: All they're blowing are glass clippings.

1535
02:03:13,714 --> 02:03:14,415
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no leaves.

1536
02:03:14,435 --> 02:03:15,495
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaves are gone already.

1537
02:03:15,876 --> 02:03:17,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't come back until mid-October.

1538
02:03:18,178 --> 02:03:20,059
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the point of them anyway?

1539
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:27,805
[SPEAKER_03]: People are using them to blow dirt or mulch or grass clippings.

1540
02:03:28,326 --> 02:03:29,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would ask,

1541
02:03:30,612 --> 02:03:37,496
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to take a look at what the experts say, that would be Scott's lawn care.

1542
02:03:38,316 --> 02:03:40,477
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go right onto their website.

1543
02:03:40,517 --> 02:03:42,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to just quote this.

1544
02:03:42,358 --> 02:03:43,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let it go after this.

1545
02:03:44,453 --> 02:03:46,874
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a question we all face when mowing the grass.

1546
02:03:47,114 --> 02:03:50,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I bag my clippings or leave them on the lawn?

1547
02:03:50,456 --> 02:03:52,177
[SPEAKER_03]: In most cases, the answer is easy.

1548
02:03:52,597 --> 02:03:56,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Recycle the grass clippings by leaving them on the lawn.

1549
02:03:56,999 --> 02:04:02,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing so will not only save you time and energy, but also return valuable nutrients to the lawn.

1550
02:04:02,662 --> 02:04:03,523
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say,

1551
02:04:05,507 --> 02:04:25,064
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be no problem, no issue with banning all leaf blowers from mid-March to mid-October because it's just a frivolous use of this annoying technology that should never have been introduced into civil society.

1552
02:04:25,912 --> 02:04:27,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a rake.

1553
02:04:28,573 --> 02:04:33,575
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't already, I would recommend you go to Mahoney's, and for $20, you can get a beautiful rake.

1554
02:04:34,076 --> 02:04:35,216
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good exercise.

1555
02:04:35,656 --> 02:04:36,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I do it.

1556
02:04:36,217 --> 02:04:37,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 71 years old.

1557
02:04:38,017 --> 02:04:41,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Every autumn, I do it myself, my front lawn, my backyard.

1558
02:04:42,779 --> 02:04:45,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's quiet and calm.

1559
02:04:45,761 --> 02:04:47,882
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not bringing in any exhaust fumes.

1560
02:04:48,382 --> 02:04:50,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not torturing my neighbors either.

1561
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:54,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for the opportunity to speak my case.

1562
02:04:54,642 --> 02:04:55,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1563
02:04:55,082 --> 02:04:55,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Kaplan.

1564
02:04:56,543 --> 02:04:57,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1565
02:04:59,105 --> 02:05:09,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Mr. President, I, again, I appreciate Mr. Kaplan's involvement, but again, this isn't

1566
02:05:11,467 --> 02:05:19,858
[SPEAKER_02]: anything but to look at this so we have all the information to either move forward or not move forward with an issue.

1567
02:05:20,519 --> 02:05:29,049
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is, I know that it's going to go out on social media, we all know this, that here we go again, the councils are against the environment.

1568
02:05:30,087 --> 02:05:38,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just warn the community and just again, enlighten them that this isn't anything against anything that's being said.

1569
02:05:38,809 --> 02:05:48,352
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something just to look at it and study it a little bit further because it isn't just, it's not cut and dry, first of all.

1570
02:05:48,412 --> 02:05:57,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Second of all, I'm offended in any way that an employee's race has to come up to this.

1571
02:05:57,495 --> 02:05:58,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's appalling.

1572
02:06:01,722 --> 02:06:03,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Falco.

1573
02:06:03,263 --> 02:06:05,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Any... Mr. President.

1574
02:06:06,044 --> 02:06:06,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell.

1575
02:06:06,625 --> 02:06:10,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I see Mr. Castagnetti waving his hand as fire towel.

1576
02:06:13,149 --> 02:06:13,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1577
02:06:14,349 --> 02:06:15,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul C has his hands raised.

1578
02:06:17,551 --> 02:06:19,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul C. Hello.

1579
02:06:19,952 --> 02:06:20,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1580
02:06:22,054 --> 02:06:22,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1581
02:06:22,894 --> 02:06:23,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record please.

1582
02:06:25,195 --> 02:06:28,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Paul Canuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford, Mass.

1583
02:06:29,756 --> 02:06:32,177
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, good evening to the Honorable City Council.

1584
02:06:33,657 --> 02:06:34,997
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just like to go on record, you know.

1585
02:06:35,437 --> 02:06:36,978
[SPEAKER_10]: And welcome back, former presidents.

1586
02:06:37,878 --> 02:06:38,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1587
02:06:38,958 --> 02:06:49,401
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear a lot lately of looking for additional ways to raise revenues and whether it's going to be a proposition two and a half or a debt exclusion by certain members of the council.

1588
02:06:50,261 --> 02:06:52,661
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all for things to make our city better.

1589
02:06:53,062 --> 02:06:54,522
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm not for is

1590
02:06:55,682 --> 02:07:04,230
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, this is a, this is, this as a proposed, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President, it's going to be an additional tax.

1591
02:07:04,670 --> 02:07:19,563
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I talked to my landscaper who does about 25 houses on our street, and they're talking about an extra a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars per household, because if they have to use rakes and not the proper equipment to do the job, then they're not going to be able to do it for the same price.

1592
02:07:20,163 --> 02:07:26,908
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd rather see our money go towards the schools, go towards the fire department, the police department, and things of that nature.

1593
02:07:27,348 --> 02:07:31,472
[SPEAKER_00]: With all due respect, I think that this is an overshot of government.

1594
02:07:31,912 --> 02:07:38,097
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is going to put a burden on people that take their homes and their beautiful homes and try to make them better.

1595
02:07:38,657 --> 02:07:44,641
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if the landscape prices keep going up, you're going to see people not getting it done because it's unaffordable.

1596
02:07:45,602 --> 02:07:48,047
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to see that happen in my community that I love.

1597
02:07:48,528 --> 02:07:50,212
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is an overstep of government.

1598
02:07:50,653 --> 02:07:54,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really believe that we should take a step back and really look at this.

1599
02:07:54,970 --> 02:08:02,074
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you drive by homes in this community, people can't maintain the properties as they are in some occasions, and it's not fair to the neighbors.

1600
02:08:02,714 --> 02:08:07,356
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that being said, I just wanted to go on record in absolutely opposing this.

1601
02:08:07,817 --> 02:08:13,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're gonna hear from a lot of the landscapers in the community, the DPW, and Michael Marks, you're right on target, Councilor.

1602
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:20,043
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you say that the city can do them next to Morrison Park, Placestead Park, and other parks, but you can't have your home cleaned?

1603
02:08:20,643 --> 02:08:24,785
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make sense, Mr. President, but I just wanted to go on record and be against this.

1604
02:08:25,406 --> 02:08:27,207
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for taking the time to listen to me.

1605
02:08:28,307 --> 02:08:29,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Camuso.

1606
02:08:30,789 --> 02:08:32,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Castagnetti, did I see your hand up?

1607
02:08:35,411 --> 02:08:35,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, sir.

1608
02:08:37,172 --> 02:08:38,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

1609
02:08:41,215 --> 02:08:43,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please, Mr. Castagnetti.

1610
02:08:48,699 --> 02:08:49,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrew?

1611
02:08:49,099 --> 02:08:49,840
[SPEAKER_09]: He just has to unmute.

1612
02:08:50,650 --> 02:08:52,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it keeps going on and off.

1613
02:08:52,971 --> 02:08:54,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1614
02:08:54,331 --> 02:08:55,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me now?

1615
02:08:55,052 --> 02:08:56,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1616
02:08:56,332 --> 02:08:57,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we can, Mr. Castagnetti.

1617
02:08:57,512 --> 02:08:57,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1618
02:08:58,253 --> 02:08:59,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1619
02:09:00,433 --> 02:09:02,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew Castagnetti, East Medford.

1620
02:09:05,495 --> 02:09:11,817
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may play devil's advocate, I'm neither here nor there on this issue.

1621
02:09:12,598 --> 02:09:19,480
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I must recollect when I was on my honeymoon in California many decades ago,

1622
02:09:20,474 --> 02:09:26,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I was rudely awakened one morning by the sound of the leaf blower for the first time in my lifetime.

1623
02:09:27,699 --> 02:09:28,960
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not a pleasant sound.

1624
02:09:29,821 --> 02:09:37,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I was out there in the field, even near Big Sur, mind you, I didn't appreciate all that debris going in my face.

1625
02:09:38,687 --> 02:09:40,529
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do own a rake.

1626
02:09:42,230 --> 02:09:44,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And I own snow shovels, plural.

1627
02:09:45,232 --> 02:09:46,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not sure if

1628
02:09:47,218 --> 02:09:50,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, the new generation knows what slow shovels are.

1629
02:09:50,541 --> 02:09:52,542
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wish you well in your deliberations.

1630
02:09:53,723 --> 02:09:54,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like hearing it.

1631
02:09:54,864 --> 02:09:56,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like the debris.

1632
02:09:57,186 --> 02:10:00,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand time is money, et cetera, et cetera.

1633
02:10:01,470 --> 02:10:02,771
[SPEAKER_07]: And the cat is out of the bag.

1634
02:10:02,791 --> 02:10:08,455
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as you preserve our second amendment and leave that cat out of the bag, I'm all set.

1635
02:10:08,516 --> 02:10:09,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, sir.

1636
02:10:09,636 --> 02:10:10,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1637
02:10:10,797 --> 02:10:12,359
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be seeing you back at the chambers here.

1638
02:10:13,059 --> 02:10:13,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

1639
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:14,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Come to me, sir.

1640
02:10:16,453 --> 02:10:18,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1641
02:10:19,076 --> 02:10:22,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to assure Mr. Castagnetti that I know what a snow shovel is.

1642
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:28,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I was out before our Committee of the Whole with one and I'll be out after this meeting as well with a snow shovel.

1643
02:10:28,688 --> 02:10:30,249
[SPEAKER_05]: And we rake as well.

1644
02:10:31,411 --> 02:10:35,676
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want to say, you know, there's been a lot of putting words in people's mouths tonight.

1645
02:10:36,203 --> 02:10:38,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's a productive way to have a discussion.

1646
02:10:39,444 --> 02:10:45,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope we study the issue, and I'm just glad that somebody used a cut and dry metaphor to discuss this issue.

1647
02:10:45,985 --> 02:10:46,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1648
02:10:46,565 --> 02:10:46,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1649
02:10:47,345 --> 02:10:48,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussions on this?

1650
02:10:50,045 --> 02:11:03,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Hearing and seeing none, on the motion by Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Bears, that this be sent to the Subcommittee on Environmental Affairs for a study and report back to the Council.
