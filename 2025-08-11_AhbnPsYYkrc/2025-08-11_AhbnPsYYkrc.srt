1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:05,434
[SPEAKER_04]: and especially the three designer selection panel members, which you'll see on a later slide.

2
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:12,999
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to the September 23rd designer selection panel meeting at the MSBA.

3
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:16,501
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first of the designer selection panel meetings.

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,403
[SPEAKER_04]: That's to review the applications of all of the designers.

5
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:39,720
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of that meeting, the designer selection panel will rank or invite the top four, typically, firms to a second DSP meeting, which will be on October 6th, and that is for interviews of those shortlisted, your top four picks.

6
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:47,767
[SPEAKER_04]: After the interviews, the designer selection panel will have a discussion, and then those four firms will be ranked

7
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:52,631
[SPEAKER_04]: from most desired down to number four.

8
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:58,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we would enter into a fee negotiation with that top firm.

9
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:05,741
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hoping that after the second DSP meeting, we can move fairly quickly on getting a contract executed.

10
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:16,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully by mid-November, we have them on board and we're starting some of the real robust feasibility study items with the design team.

11
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:26,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to just again a high level overview of the designer selection process.

12
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,294
[SPEAKER_04]: The designer selection process is a part of the MSBA's standard process.

13
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:35,835
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a requirement that they

14
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:42,662
[SPEAKER_04]: that they have through their program in order to hire the designer selection.

15
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:50,049
[SPEAKER_04]: So they do not focus on the DCAM designer selection board since the MSBA designer selection panel kind of replaces that.

16
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:57,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Any project greater than five million, school building project with the MSBA requires a designer selection panel.

17
00:01:57,896 --> 00:01:58,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously this project

18
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:03,532
[SPEAKER_04]: is far over $5 million, so we fall into that category.

19
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:09,836
[SPEAKER_04]: The selection of the designer is a qualifications-based selection.

20
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:12,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure that that's highlighted.

21
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:27,207
[SPEAKER_04]: It is all based on the proposals and the qualifications that the architectural firms meet, and then you get into the contract negotiation after those designer selection panels that I mentioned on the previous slide.

22
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:37,577
[SPEAKER_04]: The qualifications and selection criteria are pretty similar on all MSBA projects.

23
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:46,543
[SPEAKER_04]: They largely focus on the past experience and performance of the firms, what their current workload may be.

24
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:52,447
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to submit their entire consulting team with their submissions.

25
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:56,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just the architects, it's the electrical engineers, the plumbing engineers.

26
00:02:56,887 --> 00:02:58,908
[SPEAKER_04]: the structural engineers.

27
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:07,010
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a pretty big and robust packet that gets submitted with 25 plus sub consultants.

28
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So we take a look at all of their consultants as well, make sure that they are also qualified to be a part of the team.

29
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:16,053
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll look at the financial stability of each of the firms.

30
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:27,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and along with the qualifications, also the individual people, uh, everybody is required to submit a resume, uh, for anybody that has proposed to be on their team.

31
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:33,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and we also take a close look at the, uh, the geographic proximity to the project.

32
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:34,412
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want somebody.

33
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,203
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to have a hard time during construction getting to the job site to oversee the construction activities.

34
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:50,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something that we also want to make sure that the design firm is able to support the district as best as possible.

35
00:03:52,731 --> 00:04:00,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we get further down into some of the actual evaluation materials, you'll see some of these kind of criteria again.

36
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:09,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll move on just so that we can get down to some of the bulk of the presentation.

37
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:19,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a reminder, the designer selection panel is composed of 13 members appointed by the executive director at the MSBA.

38
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:24,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are all professionals either in the educational or architectural or engineering spaces.

39
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:29,121
[SPEAKER_04]: that get appointed to the board of directors.

40
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:37,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with those 13 people, three members from the district are represented, which are the three people listed here.

41
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's extremely important.

42
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:50,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've, we've kind of talked about this before that, you know, the three members are vocal during that time, obviously it's a board of 16 people and you only have three people there.

43
00:04:51,378 --> 00:05:03,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, making sure that you're really highlighting the things that you like about certain firms and, and, you know, expressing your interest, uh, is certainly an important thing to do, um, as that decision is being made.

44
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:10,289
[SPEAKER_04]: DSP meetings, I kind of already touched on this previously.

45
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,770
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the three members from the district.

46
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:20,373
[SPEAKER_04]: The MSBA is not fond of you coming into a DSP meeting with your firms already ranked.

47
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:29,936
[SPEAKER_04]: The designer selection panel is the body that selects the architect and the designer, not just the three members or the building committee.

48
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:46,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes, we want to have an idea of which architects are, you know, coming to the top, but the MSBA does not like us to come in with, like, here are 1, 2, 3, 4, because that's what's set at the designer selection panel meetings.

49
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:57,854
[SPEAKER_04]: The bottom half of the screen here that the typical example, when they ask you to the three members to vote on their top three choices.

50
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:00,515
[SPEAKER_04]: First choice gets three points.

51
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:03,577
[SPEAKER_04]: The second choice gets two points third choice gets one.

52
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:11,175
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have a close fourth, the MSBA will allow you to interview that fourth designer.

53
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:21,338
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something we'll keep in mind once we get the proposals and are heading into the DSP meetings, you know, which four firms seem to be jumping out at us.

54
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:29,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a quick update, Matt, I think the actual, the date for that second DSP meeting is October 7th, which is the Tuesday.

55
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:33,363
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll update this before we post the presentation.

56
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:35,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

57
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:53,676
[SPEAKER_04]: An award of contract, again, I kind of touched base on this, but after the two designer selection panels, you will have a top-ranked firm, and you will go into negotiations with that firm.

58
00:06:54,576 --> 00:07:00,440
[SPEAKER_04]: If negotiations are successful, you draft a contract and move on and get right into feasibility.

59
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:08,005
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're not, you can decide to move on to your second-ranked designer and begin the negotiations with them.

60
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:21,473
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't decide to, and just to point out, yeah, if we don't go with the highest ranked firm, we do have to provide a written justification to the MSBA to go to our second.

61
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:28,820
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that ends up happening, we'll certainly work with you on that.

62
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's fairly rare in my experience to not get the top ranked firm, but it obviously can happen.

63
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:39,469
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to touch on that quick.

64
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:51,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I move into some of the materials of the actual evaluation process, are there any questions on process or schedule?

65
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:03,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to actually not share the PowerPoint for this just because it's impossible to read.

66
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:05,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will...

67
00:08:08,245 --> 00:08:12,448
[SPEAKER_04]: pull up the actual documents, so we can look at them a little bit easier.

68
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:20,492
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, can you see, can you see my screen.

69
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:32,416
[SPEAKER_04]: So the two examples of the two documents that were on that slide, one of them is this one.

70
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:36,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a designer and sub-consultant application matrix.

71
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:47,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we get the proposals, we'll put each of the, you know, you have your architectural firm, who's the lead designer, and then all of their sub-consultants.

72
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So left field will fill this out.

73
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,500
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something we need to submit to the MSBA.

74
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an MSBA document.

75
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll just put, you know, which firm is being carried by each of the applicants.

76
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:06,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also track if they are MBE or WBE certified on the sheet as well.

77
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,093
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll make a mark of which companies fall into those two categories.

78
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:18,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the bottom part- Sorry, Matt, through the chair, we just can't see anything in the yellow, if that matters.

79
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:19,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

80
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,420
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to make it larger, sorry.

81
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:36,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I got my share screen thing in the way.

82
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:41,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a little better?

83
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:44,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Much.

84
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:45,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

85
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:46,433
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

86
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:53,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, down at the bottom here, this is just kind of a yes or no.

87
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:56,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they submit everything that they were supposed to submit?

88
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:14,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, if a firm does not submit any of these documents, you know, they haven't signed their application or they didn't provide any of their MCPPO certifications, they technically could be eliminated from the process just from not following the request for services request.

89
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:29,325
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more of a double check at the bottom, making sure that, again, the proposals are complete and meet all of the evaluation criteria laid out in the RFS.

90
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, a pretty simple document.

91
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:32,966
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something left field will complete.

92
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:40,868
[SPEAKER_04]: The other document that was on that, and this is less important to see, this is just a reference check.

93
00:10:43,687 --> 00:11:00,839
[SPEAKER_04]: spreadsheet so as we get all of the proposals left field will also call all of the uh references that they include in their proposal they're required to to provide a minimum of three uh we try to get at least three uh and we you know we ask each of the uh

94
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:05,667
[SPEAKER_04]: each of the references that we call how the firms performed.

95
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:08,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they communicate well?

96
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:11,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Was their budget control and estimating on target?

97
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Their document control, were their documents good?

98
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:18,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they issue documents timely?

99
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:24,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Design schedule, quite simply, did they meet the design schedule?

100
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:26,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we have to push back any deadlines?

101
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:43,103
[SPEAKER_04]: And then construction administration, this is when the architect is actually on site, walking around the job site, making sure that the design or the actual building itself is meeting the design that they've put in their documents.

102
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:51,910
[SPEAKER_04]: So we ask these questions of three references from each of the designers and just to make sure that we're doing our due diligence.

103
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:58,576
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there's no surprises from any of the firms that have submitted.

104
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions on those two?

105
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,161
[SPEAKER_04]: These are pretty straightforward.

106
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:10,484
[SPEAKER_04]: They're largely, you know, left field's kind of responsibility to get completed.

107
00:12:14,787 --> 00:12:16,468
[SPEAKER_05]: If not... Oh, sorry.

108
00:12:16,488 --> 00:12:21,672
[SPEAKER_05]: When will we have to do our... When will we receive the applicants

109
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,161
[SPEAKER_05]: information and how long will we have to rank them?

110
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:32,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will be receiving our applications on August 27th.

111
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:43,637
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get them over to the MSBA shortly after that, but we have the ability to review up until the first designer selection panel meeting on September 26th.

112
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:48,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have about a month to review everything.

113
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we'll send them all to the MSBA as well so they can do their review.

114
00:12:54,444 --> 00:13:02,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And during that time, you know, we'll be doing these first two documents, the subconsultant matrix and this reference check as well.

115
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:07,471
[SPEAKER_03]: The... Hi, Matt.

116
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:11,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you continue... Are you still answering that question?

117
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:13,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a follow-on question.

118
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:18,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke, I was just trying to call on you.

119
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:20,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt, Luke has a question.

120
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:25,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think you could pause for a couple of questions?

121
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:26,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

122
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:27,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke?

123
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:28,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Matt.

124
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:28,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

125
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:31,848
[SPEAKER_03]: So appreciate the insight into the process.

126
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:39,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good to see all the categories as well as sort of

127
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,620
[SPEAKER_03]: how the measurements performed.

128
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:57,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these documents, when populated, like articles of public record that we have to do something with or that we have to process, or is it all internal to left field and the three candidates on the DSP?

129
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:05,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's anything that the committee needs to do per se.

130
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:13,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, if there's anything that jumps out at committee members during the review process, certainly let us know.

131
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:21,726
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it certainly will become a part of the public record of the designer selection process.

132
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is public record.

133
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, at the end of the day, they will become public record.

134
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:35,010
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's not something that we need to like post and share to, um, you know, throughout the city.

135
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:51,195
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, um, when we went through this with, um, the OPM selection, the advice we got from our, uh, city solicitor was that all of those things could be made available once the contract was executed.

136
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:55,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so there, while they are public records, they're not

137
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:02,302
[SPEAKER_06]: for consumption during the selection process in that broad way that they would otherwise be.

138
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:07,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So we immediately got lots of requests for people who did not get selected.

139
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:16,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And the guidance from the city solicitor was that they have to wait until the contract is executed and then we'll provide those requested documents to them.

140
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:17,809
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's exactly what we did.

141
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

142
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.

143
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:22,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

144
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:25,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone else have questions before we continue?

145
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:29,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a quick question.

146
00:15:30,424 --> 00:15:40,547
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're saying we get these, the proposals over to the MSBA, but I assume this is something that's like a PDF, like will be shared with us to look at electronically.

147
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:42,628
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like necessarily delivered.

148
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:45,429
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not gonna be like a hard copy somewhere we all have to go look at.

149
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:54,632
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we did request, I think four hard copies to be delivered to City Hall, but yeah, everything for the most part is electronic.

150
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:55,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll,

151
00:15:57,092 --> 00:16:05,400
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure we have all of the proposals after the deadline at 4 PM and send out a link with all of the proposals to the full committee.

152
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:10,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions?

153
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:15,609
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

154
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:19,072
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

155
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:29,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Now over to the document that is most critical for the committee to understand, especially the three DSP members.

156
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:38,416
[SPEAKER_04]: But we always encourage the full building committee to review the applications and try to fill out an evaluation matrix similar to this.

157
00:16:38,517 --> 00:16:40,718
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just an example of something we've used.

158
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:46,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of keeps you away from numbering and ranking.

159
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the MSBA does not like that.

160
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:58,829
[SPEAKER_04]: But it gives you a sense of what firms maybe were a bit more advantageous than others in each of the categories.

161
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,254
[SPEAKER_04]: It uses a very simple kind of stoplight evaluation ranking.

162
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:09,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Just highly advantageous, advantageous is yellow, and then not advantageous is red.

163
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:18,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Just randomly populated on the far left here, this is just an example of kind of what it may look like as you go through each of the criteria.

164
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:29,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at the bottom, it just has a summary that kind of gives you, you know, how many highly advantageous, advantageous and not advantageous categories each firm had.

165
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:35,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So it kind of gives you the ability to look at it from a, you know, a fairly high level.

166
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you look through each of the proposals, things will certainly jump out at you from, you know, one,

167
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:52,316
[SPEAKER_04]: from one proposal to another, and that may, you know, change your feeling on how you evaluate each of these criteria.

168
00:17:52,376 --> 00:18:00,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So before I get too far into it, are there any questions kind of how this works?

169
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:03,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody want to look at anything specific?

170
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:26,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, just to say that this is a kind of important document to track your own thoughts when you're going through these, because with, you know, as Matt had mentioned, we've got 20 applicants that have pulled the RFS and will likely have a lot of interest in this project.

171
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:27,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we're going through

172
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,294
[SPEAKER_07]: a high number of these proposals, you're going to tend to forget who said what.

173
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:39,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when you're reviewing, make some notes, use this form to kind of help compare in your own mind.

174
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:44,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Just helpful when we have so many that we're expecting.

175
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:49,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I can certainly create a notes section

176
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:55,313
[SPEAKER_04]: or a note sheet or something to include with this.

177
00:18:55,874 --> 00:19:02,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make sure everybody has this in the native Excel file so they can edit it and do what they need.

178
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:08,584
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can add a specific note section just to help organize things a little better.

179
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:17,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Any specific questions?

180
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:25,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's probably a lot of people that haven't been through this before and it definitely can be fairly daunting.

181
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:30,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if many people had a chance to look at the example proposal that I sent over.

182
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:37,368
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of weeks ago is actually this proposal here.

183
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:44,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It was from KBA on the Brockton High School project who inevitably won that project.

184
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:48,378
[SPEAKER_04]: But it gives you a sense, you know, this is 85 pages long.

185
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are pretty long documents.

186
00:19:55,198 --> 00:20:02,283
[SPEAKER_04]: It does anybody have any desire to walk through this quickly just to kind of see how they're laid out?

187
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:10,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know kind of what the feeling is on people's comfort level on reviewing these proposals.

188
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:22,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I correct that the MSBA is pretty prescriptive about what must be included in the proposal, just like they are with the RFS for OPMs?

189
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:23,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

190
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:24,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

191
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:24,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

192
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:37,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the structure in general, the structure of the proposals will look somewhat similar because they're required to complete the same set of documents, and I think you'll

193
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:52,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of quickly find the pieces of the proposal that speak to you and it may or may not be what the prescribed attachments are and they weren't for me certainly in the RFS review process for the OPM.

194
00:20:53,036 --> 00:21:00,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's good to just take them in for what they are when we receive them.

195
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:05,360
[SPEAKER_06]: So unless people have specific questions, I don't think we need to go through this.

196
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions?

197
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:16,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say there's usually a few pages towards the end of the approach to your project where Matt's clicking right now.

198
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:23,714
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be a few pages reserved for specifically how they're taking a look at your project.

199
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:27,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually find those very interesting.

200
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:36,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And not to mention things that you might not be thinking of that you can take forward with us as we move through the design process.

201
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:41,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Some good information in this particular section.

202
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:49,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, and like Jen said that that's definitely typically towards the end up in the in the front is a lot of those MSBA requirements.

203
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:52,981
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like MCPPO certifications.

204
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:58,485
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the project team's resumes are all in here.

205
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:05,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's probably like half of this, because it's not just the design, not just the architectural firm, it's all of their consultants as well.

206
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:20,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of, you know, resumes, but I would say a large majority of the information that's gonna capture is going to be in, you know, each firm's approach to your project.

207
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:28,362
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, as we get these, like, feel free to reach out to any of the left field members with questions you have.

208
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:32,927
[SPEAKER_04]: We're more than happy to talk to you and walk you through it.

209
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have one question from Luke.

210
00:22:39,874 --> 00:22:40,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

211
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:41,316
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Matt.

212
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:50,003
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a timeline and August 27 consequential date.

213
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:52,667
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sort of the end of the suspense.

214
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:58,836
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a number of these designer proposals, potentially 20 maybe less, but

215
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:00,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Good number.

216
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:11,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to clarify, will this committee in its, I guess, entirety be reviewing each proposal and scoring per that spreadsheet?

217
00:23:11,774 --> 00:23:17,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it a subset of this committee that's kind of performing the evaluation?

218
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:25,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it done differently in different cities.

219
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:28,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had full committees review each of the proposals.

220
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:31,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had people create a smaller selection committee.

221
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:38,257
[SPEAKER_04]: My general feeling on it is the more eyes on it, the better.

222
00:23:38,357 --> 00:23:41,638
[SPEAKER_04]: More different walks of life, looking at it from slightly different optics.

223
00:23:42,578 --> 00:23:45,619
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, is always a good way to kind of get more feedback.

224
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,301
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is certainly up to the committee's, you know, preference.

225
00:23:51,881 --> 00:23:58,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, those three DSP members, you know, certainly need to review them and understand them.

226
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:05,006
[SPEAKER_04]: But we always do try to encourage the full committees to review them, again, just from what I mentioned before.

227
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if Jen or Linda have anything to add.

228
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:10,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I would add that.

229
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:19,865
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this committee will review will review will have access to everything and I think from what I've seen work best we are.

230
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:29,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say those score sheets with the colors are really more for your personal review and as a group will discuss, but

231
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:33,979
[SPEAKER_07]: And Matt or Linda, correct me if you've seen it.

232
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:47,746
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's really to help inform those three DSP members on the goals and the hopes and dreams of this committee so they can bring that into the DSP, into the DSP meetings.

233
00:24:48,726 --> 00:24:53,249
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's going to be more of a kind of discussion when we go over everything and less

234
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:11,774
[SPEAKER_07]: less about, you know, scoring things against each other, saying, you know, I voted for this person to, you know, I'm saying this is highly advantageous, and somebody else says this is highly advantageous, just so that we can stay away from what the MSBA would consider scoring.

235
00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:13,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranking, yeah.

236
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:14,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

237
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:15,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.

238
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:23,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So to our committee, is this a process that we've already determined and

239
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:32,304
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of identify sort of roles and responsibilities for or is that a yet to be activity for us?

240
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:50,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Just seeking to kind of remove any ambiguity in I guess our responsibilities in this process because August 27th will be here before we know it and with potentially 20 proposals to get through and a variety of

241
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:56,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say evaluation criteria to process a workload.

242
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:11,890
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I guess, do we know how we're gonna process this volume or is that a yet to be sort of determined sort of activity process?

243
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:22,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can answer that we have a building committee scheduled in the timeframe between August 27th and the designer selection panel.

244
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:26,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not exactly remembering the date, but there is 1 scheduled in.

245
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:29,805
[SPEAKER_06]: September.

246
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:40,594
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was scheduled that way so that the entire committee could provide their insight and perspective to the members of the DSP.

247
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:45,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless this team feels differently, that that should not be the case.

248
00:26:45,777 --> 00:26:49,981
[SPEAKER_06]: That was what we were planning on for the next building committee meeting.

249
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:51,982
[SPEAKER_06]: September 15th.

250
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:52,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

251
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:12,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So, before we move on, is there anybody who feels like we should not proceed in that fashion?

252
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:26,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe if I could just add something real quick to the committee in regards to these questions.

253
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:36,299
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, if you look at it, sort of more of a way of determining which ones are out versus which one is your favourite.

254
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:41,002
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of trying to eliminate the ones that you don't think will be a good fit.

255
00:27:42,232 --> 00:27:54,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you start looking at it from that aspect, it might be a little less daunting, because there will be some that are just submitting, even though they're just going to not be qualified for a project of this size.

256
00:27:56,274 --> 00:28:03,600
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have 20 firms that have requested it, most likely we will not get all 20 submissions.

257
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:13,707
[SPEAKER_01]: But say you get 15 to 17 of those, you can start looking at probably five or six of those might just not be qualified at all.

258
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:22,613
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the MSBA not wanting you to rank which ones are the favorites, it's a little bit easier to just sort of see which ones should we not consider.

259
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:29,433
[SPEAKER_05]: So through the chair, those will be taken out so we don't even have to review them.

260
00:28:29,953 --> 00:28:31,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Leftfield is going to do that for us.

261
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:34,936
[SPEAKER_05]: So 20- No, we have to do that.

262
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:37,378
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to do that.

263
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:38,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

264
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:46,883
[SPEAKER_06]: The MSBA does not want the left field team telling us what we should pick.

265
00:28:47,764 --> 00:28:51,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're here to help guide our process, but it is our process.

266
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:57,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I don't know if anybody could weed out the ones that just don't qualify at all.

267
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:18,739
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be some, like Matt was saying, we will review the things that were, you know, the box needs to be checked so that it kind of frees up not just the DSP members, but the larger committee to really focus in on, I think, those approach to your project sheets that Matt was showing.

268
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's six, I want to say six pages for each proposal?

269
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:44,190
[SPEAKER_07]: um worth of that so that kind of really narrows it doesn't feel as daunting if you're really focused on those sections as this larger committee i think that will help um everyone kind of focus in on what what firms are doing well what they're paying attention to um if they really if they feel like they really have been paying attention to medford and they know medford um

270
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,153
[SPEAKER_07]: as opposed to all the nitty gritty details that we will fill out in those spreadsheets.

271
00:29:49,973 --> 00:29:55,237
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are the things I think that are probably worth the most focus for this larger group especially.

272
00:29:55,257 --> 00:30:07,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I think we also have a very well-represented committee with lots of different strengths and interests.

273
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:14,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I don't think everyone needs to evaluate every proposal on all the same things.

274
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,129
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll pick on Tracy for just a second.

275
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:30,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm expecting Tracy to tell us what he thinks about all things performing arts, because that is his background, and his passion, and the things that he's good at.

276
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:35,100
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the reasons his application was so appealing to us.

277
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,704
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think everyone's going to bring a different set of criteria to the table.

278
00:30:40,744 --> 00:30:44,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think when we talk about what impressed us about people,

279
00:30:45,007 --> 00:31:00,222
[SPEAKER_06]: What didn't seem like it was sufficient in our next meeting, I think we'll hear, you know, lots of different perspectives from lots of different people that will help us be as prepared as possible to be 3 of 13 people.

280
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:07,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a big job to do to, like, represent Medford amongst a bunch of people who.

281
00:31:09,428 --> 00:31:12,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly have done this more than we have, but are not don't live here.

282
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:16,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, aren't the ones that will receive this building.

283
00:31:16,996 --> 00:31:21,660
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think all the all that feedback, the better in our next meeting.

284
00:31:23,663 --> 00:31:28,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Jenny, can I ask if we're discouraged from assessing the entirety of the proposal and are instead is.

285
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:34,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Viewed as specialists kind of with you can review in any way that you want Luke.

286
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:39,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying that, like, we don't need we don't need everybody, like.

287
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:45,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Going through all the, like, my new shut and the nitty gritty, like, left field is going to handle the qualifying things.

288
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there are things that you're particularly passionate about, that's what we want to hear from this group.

289
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:52,805
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't.

290
00:31:54,172 --> 00:31:59,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you have the time and inclination to go through every part of the proposal, that's amazing.

291
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:04,895
[SPEAKER_06]: But just everyone has a different amount of ability to do that.

292
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:22,780
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can, but I think that I just don't want people to be discouraged from putting their like piece, you know, their piece of their interest into the conversation if they don't have time to review everything, which is just kind of, you know, it's going to be September and back to school.

293
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:22,940
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

294
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:26,700
[SPEAKER_06]: We should prepare for that, too.

295
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:43,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to further clarify, the homework assignment is not written feedback, but instead just a commitment to read proposals, assess them however we feel is important, and then arrive at the meeting on the 15th and verbally

296
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:47,834
[SPEAKER_03]: fight or defend any particular thing that we're interested in.

297
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,276
[SPEAKER_03]: So written feedback is not sought.

298
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:54,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Full assessment of proposals is not required.

299
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead it's, you know, almost sounds like a best effort on the 15th.

300
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:01,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

301
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:02,803
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what, okay.

302
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:04,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want that clarified.

303
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:04,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

304
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:09,847
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

305
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me open the presentation back up.

306
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:34,989
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's no other questions on the designer selection process side of things or the DSP or proposal review, we have two other updates that we did want to talk about.

307
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:42,390
[SPEAKER_04]: One was quickly the, hold on, something's going on, sorry.

308
00:33:49,018 --> 00:33:54,308
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was the educational plan and the goal was to, you know, kind of get ahead of

309
00:33:56,472 --> 00:34:00,015
[SPEAKER_04]: the educational plan before the architect gets on board.

310
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:04,059
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that that's something that they're going to be working on first.

311
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:07,722
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to get a little bit of a head start and start to work on it.

312
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:25,297
[SPEAKER_04]: The updates over the last couple of months are on the screen here, but I did want to invite Dr. Galussi to kind of fill us in quickly or mention anything that she's seen about the ed plan.

313
00:34:26,553 --> 00:34:26,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

314
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:26,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

315
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:27,573
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

316
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:28,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

317
00:34:29,474 --> 00:34:34,176
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ed plan is a really critical component of this work.

318
00:34:34,396 --> 00:34:41,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been trying to make sure that we're keeping our administrators updated and in the work.

319
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:47,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that started with at the end of each year, we have what's called like an administrative retreat.

320
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:49,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just meetings to close out the year.

321
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:55,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Adele and Jen joined that meeting to kind of frame the work.

322
00:34:56,032 --> 00:35:04,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I also spoke about, you know, the importance and how this is the document that's really going to aid us in a lot of decision making as we move through this process.

323
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:20,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they also were there to answer questions and just kind of the administrative unit was able to get introduced to Jen and Adele, who is our educational consultant through left field, former superintendent.

324
00:35:21,344 --> 00:35:24,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely, the educators will be leaning on her a lot.

325
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:31,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of, after that meeting, I sent a memo to really outline the process.

326
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:36,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Jen set us up really nicely with a lot of the information that we needed.

327
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:52,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty much taking a lot of that information and just framing it in a memo for administration to kind of get them thinking before people went off and enjoyed some time at the pool and the beach so they could be mindful and kind of have that thinking.

328
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,420
[SPEAKER_02]: A month later,

329
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:03,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It was followed up by a little bit more specific of a memo regarding now like a timeline and hard dates, really this educational plan to what.

330
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:32,563
[SPEAKER_02]: member graham spoke about this also is pretty prescribed there are it's broken down by like departments so it's pretty clear when we look at our administrators the pieces that principals are going to kind of be responsible for versus the pieces that some of our curriculum directors and leads would be responsible for so this that memo at the end of july was

331
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:38,907
[SPEAKER_02]: very clear in assigning what the tasks were for administrators to be completing.

332
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:44,711
[SPEAKER_02]: We're asking for their drafts, for them to first start and frame what their draft would be.

333
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:47,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it's composed of two questions.

334
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:51,236
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much like, what are we doing now to deliver curriculum?

335
00:36:51,636 --> 00:36:53,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are we teaching?

336
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,979
[SPEAKER_02]: And what would we envision?

337
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,682
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we want this to look in a new building?

338
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:20,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we asked administrators next week to have that draft finished so that we're set when we welcome teachers back and the administrators can be working with the teachers on the draft and getting their voice into this document.

339
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:24,993
[SPEAKER_02]: So to help the teachers provide a little bit of framing,

340
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:29,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Tours were set up that we've been engaged, the last one finished today.

341
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:44,402
[SPEAKER_02]: You know we've had some tours previously, but the Medford High School staff was invited to tour Dover High School in New Hampshire on the 6th, Waltham High School on the 7th, and today was Attleboro High School.

342
00:37:45,422 --> 00:37:55,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's been a nice cross section of administration that's gone to some of these tours as well as educators and also some of those educators are

343
00:37:59,063 --> 00:38:04,185
[SPEAKER_02]: on union boards within the teachers union, which I think is also important.

344
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:18,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they've had the framing with the tours, and when they return, they're going to be able to do some work with principals and department leads, really working on the draft to get it ready for the end of September submission.

345
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:26,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to answer any questions if people have questions about this level of work that we've been doing for the educational plan.

346
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:29,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any questions from the committee?

347
00:38:29,615 --> 00:38:39,955
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

348
00:38:41,868 --> 00:38:42,168
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

349
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:44,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that update.

350
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:51,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good that we're, you know, I would say this far ahead of the educational plan.

351
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:55,673
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, again, typically this doesn't really start until the designers on board.

352
00:38:55,753 --> 00:39:00,254
[SPEAKER_04]: So really appreciate the district for jumping on this.

353
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:02,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it will really help us in the back end of the schedule.

354
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:19,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then the last item that we had talked about in June, uh, was this site selection kind of option, uh, evaluating and looking at the different options that are throughout the city for potential sites.

355
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:27,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, again, this is not very legible on a slide, so I am going to pull up the actual document.

356
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:39,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, can everybody see that now?

357
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:40,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully a little better.

358
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:45,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, much better.

359
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:46,099
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

360
00:39:48,499 --> 00:40:02,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to explain how this is laid out, going down the left-hand side are just kind of different site criteria, and then a little bit of description and kind of how construction would take place on each of those sites.

361
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:05,959
[SPEAKER_04]: the MSB enrollment, which is the same throughout.

362
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:11,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the site is, what kind of site is it?

363
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:14,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Who owns the site?

364
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:15,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it city-owned?

365
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:17,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it not city-owned?

366
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it parkland requiring an Article 97 land swap?

367
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:26,498
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the owner category is, cost to obtain.

368
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:35,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of these are either NA or do require an article 97 land swap or are on the existing site.

369
00:40:36,788 --> 00:40:39,370
[SPEAKER_04]: The only one I think is the Medford Square.

370
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:45,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not have a dollar value, but I do believe that that development has moved forward.

371
00:40:52,349 --> 00:41:09,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some additional notes about each site, the description of each one, what the acreage is, potential traffic issues or concerns, how will the bus routes

372
00:41:11,607 --> 00:41:14,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair on those sites, same with pedestrian.

373
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Community and proximity, how is the site located within town?

374
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:26,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Site attributes, is there anything specific about the site that we need to be aware of?

375
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:30,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Then just a quick overview of construction phasing.

376
00:41:31,202 --> 00:41:35,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, how we foresee a project on each of these sites going.

377
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:40,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And then pros and cons between each of the sites.

378
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:52,035
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the options on the existing site have the advantage of being an existing educational facility.

379
00:41:52,735 --> 00:41:53,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a known location.

380
00:41:54,997 --> 00:41:56,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some of these others, as you'll see,

381
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:14,252
[SPEAKER_04]: not only have article 97 land swap, but may not be big enough to support the project, or will only be large enough to support the school and parking, but not play fields.

382
00:42:16,674 --> 00:42:22,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So just wanted to give that real quick before we went over the options across the top.

383
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:28,828
[SPEAKER_04]: The first three here are all on the existing site.

384
00:42:28,848 --> 00:42:31,689
[SPEAKER_04]: These are just different building options on that site.

385
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:39,393
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that we're going to review these when the architect is on board, so I just wanted to include these on this as well.

386
00:42:40,873 --> 00:42:46,176
[SPEAKER_04]: No real surprises per se on these first three, it's at the existing site.

387
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:52,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Base repair option is just that, it's code upgrades, you're not getting anything new and fancy.

388
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:58,161
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a very base level project.

389
00:42:59,221 --> 00:43:05,403
[SPEAKER_04]: The base repair option also I'll just note is not considered reimbursable by the MSBA.

390
00:43:06,904 --> 00:43:13,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is something that if that option were to be the selected option would not receive MSBA funding.

391
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:16,755
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something that I have ever done.

392
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:22,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very rare that a base repair option is entertained, but I did want to note that.

393
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:28,202
[SPEAKER_04]: The renovation is just a renovation of the existing school as it currently is.

394
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:43,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep general layout the same way, general classroom and CTE class locations, really just an upgrade to the current building as it is.

395
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,783
[SPEAKER_04]: The addition renovation option, same site.

396
00:43:48,044 --> 00:44:01,934
[SPEAKER_04]: This would just be phased, you know, potential new building on the existing fields or existing parking lots with a renovation of, you know, portions of the school could be the pool house and the gym.

397
00:44:03,295 --> 00:44:05,856
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is just another option on this site.

398
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:11,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we get into some of the new build options.

399
00:44:13,873 --> 00:44:24,761
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did go through the, I forget if it was a finance committee meeting, but where the committee talked in depth about the different sites that were potential.

400
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:31,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So I pulled all of those sites into here and also took a look at just some other potential areas.

401
00:44:33,426 --> 00:44:40,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Unsurprisingly, there's not a lot of free open land in Medford of this size to build, you know,

402
00:44:42,285 --> 00:44:44,527
[SPEAKER_04]: 350, 400,000 square foot school.

403
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:51,191
[SPEAKER_04]: But just for completeness, I did list them all.

404
00:44:52,231 --> 00:45:01,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, if anybody has any comments, especially living in Medford, that you have on any particular site or know of another one that may not be on here, please let me know.

405
00:45:02,657 --> 00:45:04,839
[SPEAKER_04]: We do want to make sure that we've looked at all options.

406
00:45:07,662 --> 00:45:10,905
[SPEAKER_04]: This first new build is over at the Andrews Middle School.

407
00:45:11,746 --> 00:45:15,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I think this was from that call, just a discussion of, you know, would it be possible to

408
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:30,066
[SPEAKER_04]: renovate the existing school and add onto it to create a larger high school that would require the middle school to be relocated, which again, then we're talking about a second school project.

409
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:43,338
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of this was discussed in that meeting and I think people were kind of already leaning away from this idea, but I did want to include it since it was talked about throughout Medford.

410
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:51,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody have any questions on kind of this on the Andrews Middle School site or anything to add?

411
00:45:54,216 --> 00:45:57,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt, you're correct that the finance committee at the time.

412
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:16,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Talked about several sites that did not make it into our final package and this was 1 of them where it was discussed and rolled out because of the, like, multiple business, the multiple building project need the, you know, the traffic patterns that would be exacerbated in that area, et cetera.

413
00:46:16,564 --> 00:46:18,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So that 1 was not in contention.

414
00:46:18,765 --> 00:46:25,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And your analysis is supporting that that would not be super viable for us to consider going forward.

415
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:26,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

416
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:27,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

417
00:46:27,388 --> 00:46:36,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think those items that you mentioned, even from a site size, you know, that entire parcel is 43 plus acres, but that includes both of the schools.

418
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:42,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the middle, the Andrews middle school side of it again, it depends where you would kind of break that parcel up.

419
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:49,597
[SPEAKER_04]: is a bit smaller on that kind of north side where Andrews is away from the stadium.

420
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:54,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And I felt it was 12 to 15 or so acres.

421
00:46:54,121 --> 00:47:03,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, we could probably fit the school and parking, but I do think that the athletic fields would need to be located at a different location.

422
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:05,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

423
00:47:07,987 --> 00:47:10,209
[SPEAKER_04]: The next new option is actually back on.

424
00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:12,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you go on, I think Luke has another question.

425
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:13,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Luke.

426
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:14,112
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to excuse me.

427
00:47:14,152 --> 00:47:15,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an engineer, so I zero in on numbers.

428
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:17,194
[SPEAKER_03]: You said 350,000 to 400,000 square foot.

429
00:47:17,214 --> 00:47:17,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Hypothetical.

430
00:47:17,614 --> 00:47:19,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally hypothetical because there's really nothing

431
00:47:29,223 --> 00:47:29,703
[SPEAKER_03]: on paper.

432
00:47:30,104 --> 00:47:35,230
[SPEAKER_03]: But if that's the case, which, by the way, makes sense because Attleboro is about that size.

433
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:35,891
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about 407.

434
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:40,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there are moments about kind of what we're expecting.

435
00:47:40,296 --> 00:47:42,459
[SPEAKER_03]: So Attleboro is kind of a good reference point.

436
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:51,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Then is just calling into question, one of the entries here, is it really 330 square feet or 330,000 square feet?

437
00:47:53,221 --> 00:47:54,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And frankly, it may not matter.

438
00:47:55,342 --> 00:48:01,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this, I think this matrix serves a different purpose.

439
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:02,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a comparative tool.

440
00:48:03,807 --> 00:48:09,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that sort of square footage isn't actually really a comparison criterion.

441
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,611
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of like a note that's put in.

442
00:48:11,194 --> 00:48:14,555
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did want to just point that out, because I pointed it out in the past.

443
00:48:15,216 --> 00:48:17,197
[SPEAKER_03]: My belief is, in fact, the school is much larger.

444
00:48:17,717 --> 00:48:27,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of the historical news articles that I've looked at over in the library indicate it's like a half million square foot structure.

445
00:48:31,803 --> 00:48:38,147
[SPEAKER_03]: just pointing it out and confirming it doesn't really matter whether it's totally accurate here or not.

446
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:46,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly any square footages of anticipated new structure are very much hypothetical at this point.

447
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:47,252
[SPEAKER_04]: We do need to

448
00:48:49,233 --> 00:49:02,021
[SPEAKER_04]: get the architect on board to pull together a space summary and really understand what the full educational component of the building will be and how that will fit into the MSBA's guidelines.

449
00:49:03,182 --> 00:49:08,605
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, definitely take any square footages on here as kind of a holding point for now.

450
00:49:09,886 --> 00:49:13,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Those will certainly become much more real as we get design going.

451
00:49:14,063 --> 00:49:24,089
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that's important to know about our square footage currently is that 1395 is high school students only.

452
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:33,195
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not Kids Corner, it's not the MFN, it's not the administrative offices, and it is not the preschool expansion that was written into our

453
00:49:36,112 --> 00:49:36,632
[SPEAKER_06]: bid here.

454
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:49,237
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of those, so 1395 in terms of number of students and the associated square footage, that's one portion of the square footage that comprises what currently happens in our building.

455
00:49:49,317 --> 00:49:56,520
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we still, there's still a lot of work to do for us to sort of grapple with like how, what, how many square feet are we building here?

456
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:05,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause there's a lot of other parts that are not in that 1395 plus the administrative offices, Luke, plus the Medford family network.

457
00:50:06,442 --> 00:50:11,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and those are all things that will have to go somewhere eventually.

458
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:13,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

459
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:16,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Matt, do you want to keep going?

460
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:23,241
[SPEAKER_04]: The next new build option was on the existing site.

461
00:50:25,452 --> 00:50:32,496
[SPEAKER_04]: This would just, different than the other three options on the existing high school site, this would be an entirely new structure.

462
00:50:33,016 --> 00:50:35,018
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be some sort of phase construction.

463
00:50:35,078 --> 00:50:43,663
[SPEAKER_04]: You build one part of the school, move students and faculty in, demo the old part of the school and build new.

464
00:50:45,604 --> 00:50:48,286
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the only difference from the other options.

465
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, just,

466
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:59,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of to note, just in general, the diagrams that you see in these pictures are not necessarily how the phasing would work.

467
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:07,625
[SPEAKER_04]: It is just a kind of high level idea of how each of these projects could potentially work on the existing site.

468
00:51:10,592 --> 00:51:24,305
[SPEAKER_04]: The next new build option, the new existing site modified, we call this the modified one because this is, you know, what we will use to track, you know, potential use of DCR land.

469
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:29,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and there's other Article 97 opportunities around the site.

470
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:39,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that does end up becoming a part of the project, obviously the site itself will change slightly with that acquired land.

471
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:45,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to include that as a potential option on that site as well.

472
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:55,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford Square, before I get into a lot of this, or this option, is this worth

473
00:51:56,768 --> 00:52:07,791
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about, I believe in April or May timeframe, there was a development company selected to develop this space, or is this not the same area?

474
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:09,251
[SPEAKER_06]: That is true.

475
00:52:09,931 --> 00:52:10,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

476
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:20,234
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this one kind of just comes off the table if it's being developed by another company.

477
00:52:24,953 --> 00:52:26,875
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll move on to the next one.

478
00:52:27,956 --> 00:52:36,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbus Park, again, another Article 97 land swap would be required for this location.

479
00:52:38,584 --> 00:52:44,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I get too deep into it, the acreage on this park is about five acres.

480
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:51,772
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that that is not going to be large enough, even for just the school and parking and whatnot.

481
00:52:53,073 --> 00:52:57,675
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be extremely difficult to fit a building of the size we need on this site.

482
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:02,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, there certainly would not be any play fields at this location.

483
00:53:04,217 --> 00:53:13,621
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this one is working its way off the list fairly quickly, just from a size standpoint, nevermind any of the other criteria that we have here.

484
00:53:17,032 --> 00:53:19,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Placet Park also came up in that call.

485
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:23,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Slightly bigger, about 12 plus acres.

486
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:29,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So similar to kind of that middle school option that was around 12 or 15 acres.

487
00:53:30,136 --> 00:53:39,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, you may be able to fit the school in parking, but I think it's going to be extremely difficult to replace the existing high school fields on a 12 acre site.

488
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So this,

489
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:50,704
[SPEAKER_04]: would potentially be an option where a new school would be here, but play fields would be located at another spot.

490
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:59,508
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last option, Tufts Park, I believe this also came up in the call,

491
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:07,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, similar to the others, it's right around that 10 to 12 acreage range.

492
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:11,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Real tough site to fit a school of this size with all of the amenities on it.

493
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:14,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So similar type situation.

494
00:54:15,082 --> 00:54:22,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Could potentially fit a school, but definitely not fields at this location.

495
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:39,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody want to look at any of these, any of the other criteria, open discussion on any of the options or maybe another option that maybe I don't have on here that you think we should add?

496
00:54:48,863 --> 00:54:51,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Not seeing any questions.

497
00:54:55,579 --> 00:55:17,040
[SPEAKER_06]: If you all take a look at your agenda, we brought this back around in this meeting, because our June meeting, we talked about potentially removing Medford square and Columbus park as options to sort of reduce the scope of what the feasibility study will be looking for.

498
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:24,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you remember back to the June meeting, we talked about wanting to do this exercise.

499
00:55:24,882 --> 00:55:34,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Matt for doing such a thorough job to make sure that, you know, inevitably when people have questions that there is a place we can point them to.

500
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:37,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can certainly make this available on our website, et cetera.

501
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:43,187
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did want to circle back around the potential motion is written out on the.

502
00:55:45,235 --> 00:55:46,617
[SPEAKER_06]: on the agenda.

503
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:55,150
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody would like to make that motion now, I would be happy to entertain it, but that's up to the committee.

504
00:55:56,391 --> 00:55:56,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

505
00:55:56,672 --> 00:55:58,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

506
00:55:59,242 --> 00:56:03,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair Graham, no, I do wanna thank you, Matt and the left field team for doing that.

507
00:56:03,646 --> 00:56:17,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's important, just like member Graham said, to be able to point that out to people on why we didn't choose X, Y or Z sites and why we're gonna be pursuing the several options with the site we have, which is the largest site of them all.

508
00:56:17,859 --> 00:56:19,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And we wanna be able to maximize.

509
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:25,365
[SPEAKER_05]: the very best for our students and athletes and those in the arts.

510
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:29,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would make move the motion if there are no questions from the committee.

511
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:32,470
[SPEAKER_06]: A motion by the mayor.

512
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

513
00:56:37,914 --> 00:56:38,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

514
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Dr. Belusi.

515
00:56:42,658 --> 00:56:44,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any questions before I call the roll?

516
00:56:50,759 --> 00:56:53,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, I will call the roll.

517
00:56:55,122 --> 00:56:55,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Jenny Graham.

518
00:56:55,762 --> 00:56:56,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

519
00:56:56,243 --> 00:56:57,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

520
00:56:59,344 --> 00:56:59,565

522
00:57:02,246 --> 00:57:02,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_06]: Libby Brown.

527
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:07,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_06]: Marissa Desmond.

529
00:57:10,091 --> 00:57:10,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

530
00:57:10,852 --> 00:57:12,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Maria Dorsey is absent.

531
00:57:13,413 --> 00:57:14,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian Hilliard.

532

00:57:15,534 --> 00:57:16,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Tracy Keene is absent.

534
00:57:16,715 --> 00:57:17,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily Lazzaro is absent.

535

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

537
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:25,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And the disembodied voice of Aaron says, yes, thank you.

538
00:57:26,211 --> 00:57:31,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for extending his reach from his wifi Luke.

539
00:57:33,361 --> 00:57:33,602
