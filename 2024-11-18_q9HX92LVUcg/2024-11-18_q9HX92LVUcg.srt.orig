1
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:08,153
[SPEAKER_03]: 10th regular meeting of the Medford City Council March 8 2022 is called to order.

2
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:09,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:10,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President bears.

4
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:35,929
[SPEAKER_10]: the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

5
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:45,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

6
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:51,685
[SPEAKER_03]: If the counselors don't mind I can read this from the chair I'm actually the first resolution or.

7
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:54,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you want to come up.

8
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:59,148
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I have no problem with the reading from the chair.

9
00:00:59,168 --> 00:01:07,932
[SPEAKER_03]: 21 dash 577 offered by President Burrell be it resolved that the city of Medford through its city council raised the maximum income level for clause 41 a of MGL chapter 59 section

10
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:18,527
[SPEAKER_03]: the senior tax deferral to the amount established annually by the Commissioner of Revenue as to the income limit for single seniors who are not head of household to qualify under the senior circuit program.

11
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:30,788
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned last week, this is something we met with the whole about just the council has the power to set the maximum for seniors eligible for this program.

12
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:32,369
[SPEAKER_03]: It's currently at $50,000.

13
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:39,412
[SPEAKER_03]: The council has raised this a few times in recent years, and we met with the whole to discuss the idea of tying it to the senior

14
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:51,522
[SPEAKER_03]: circuit breaker amount which is about set by the Commissioner of Revenue goes up a small amount each year to stay with inflation and other metrics so that number is just over 61,000 right now.

15
00:01:51,922 --> 00:02:04,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would tie that to this would tie our maximum to that number in perpetuity, unless we were to revisit as a council to adjust that amount so that is the resolution of any counselors have any comments they would like to add.

16
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:12,998
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a measure that we vetted properly, we've gone through a number of meetings on and it's something that I support a lot of leak.

17
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:15,899
[SPEAKER_07]: What this does is it allows senior citizens the options to defer their taxes.

18
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,580
[SPEAKER_07]: If in fact they find themselves in a financial situation and they make the income hardship guidelines.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is a policy that would make sense for those in our community especially based upon the housing shortages that we're seeing the economic circumstances that we're seeing right now.

20
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:32,651
[SPEAKER_07]: That in fact that we have a large population of senior citizens living in this community.

21
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:37,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this only makes sense to provide them with this type of relief and I support it will hardly move approval.

22
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:50,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the discussion on emotional counselor night seconded by Vice President bears Mr. Clerk, please actually know, we know we do need to call the role, because of this is a local option.

23
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

24
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:12,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

25
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:13,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

26
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:16,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

27
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:16,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

28
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:18,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

29
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:19,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

30
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:20,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

31
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:21,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

32
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:22,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

33
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:22,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

34
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:30,943
[SPEAKER_03]: 22 dash 088 offered by counselor night, be it so resolved with the Memphis City Council congratulate James and Maureen each on a momentous occasion of their 30th wedding anniversary.

35
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:33,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight, Madam President, thank you very much.

36
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:50,476
[SPEAKER_07]: This was on the agenda last week and I requested to be tabled for the opportunities of my council colleagues to also speak on it because they know James and Maureen very well, as do I, and if anybody played Medford pop Warner in the late 80s and early 1990s, they'd know Jimmy Heath as the man with the best mullet in Medford.

37
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:55,900
[SPEAKER_07]: He and Maureen have been married now for 30 years and Maureen's been a active participant at the St.

38
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Francis Mothers Club for a number of years.

39
00:03:58,382 --> 00:04:00,463
[SPEAKER_07]: They've raised four beautiful children here in the city of Medford.

40
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,275
[SPEAKER_07]: and they recently celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary.

41
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:12,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of us may know Jimmy from his time down at Pocanti Skating Rink, driving the Zamboni, or up at the Field of Dreams, working there as a ticket taker and a security guard.

42
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:16,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And many of us know Maureen from all her involvement through youth sports, Metro Pop Warner in particular.

43
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:27,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Madam President, I'd ask that my council colleagues join me in congratulating two individuals that displayed the type of community that we here in Metro believe in, James and Maureen Heath, and the momentous occasion of their 30th anniversary.

44
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:47,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for tonight to bring this forward I think that what a fitting couple to make sure that we acknowledge such a momentous occasion, and especially for Maureen, I think to be married to a gentleman like Jim for for 30 years that that's just amazing.

45
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:54,927
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just, just an amazing feat and she should be commended and, and obviously I joke

46
00:04:57,031 --> 00:05:00,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim's a great guy, and does a lot for our community.

47
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:05,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is, these are the type of people that make Medford the great city that we live in today.

48
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:10,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Just great members, great neighbors, great community, great community members.

49
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:11,897
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations.

50
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:12,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

51
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:13,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Cabrera.

52
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:14,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Cabrera.

53
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

54
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I just want to reiterate that my council, you know, Jimmy and Maureen Long,

55
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:32,426
[SPEAKER_01]: volunteers in the community for the youth, youth sports for many years, especially mostly with the Pop Warner.

56
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:42,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been privileged to go away with them on many of the cheerleading trips that we've gone on over the years and just want to wish them a congratulation on their 30th anniversary and hopefully they'll have 30 more.

57
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:49,090
[SPEAKER_03]: on the motion of Councilor night.

58
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,890
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor.

59
00:05:50,851 --> 00:06:02,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed motion passes 22 dash 089 offered by Councilor night, be it so resolved that the Metro City Council congratulate Kevin and Kathleen Finnegan on the momentous occasion of their 20th wedding anniversary tonight.

60
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam President, thank you very much.

61
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:12,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of us know Kevin and Kathleen from Medford youth softball and Medford youth lacrosse Kevin was one of the inaugural coaches in the Medford youth lacrosse program back in the late 90s.

62
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:18,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, he rose up the ranks to become a past president actually, uh, just giving up the title just a few years ago.

63
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:33,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, when you're looking for Kevin or Kathleen, you'll probably be able to find them at one of our fields, uh, at one of these practices, softball, lacrosse, uh, sometimes the hockey rink, even I imagine that, um, but they just celebrated the 20th anniversary of the two great people that have dedicated a lot of their time, energy, commitment to this community.

64
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:40,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, especially in the realm of, uh, youth sports and, and bringing our programs together as volunteers and boards of directors and coaches and the like.

65
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:55,875
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Madam President, I'd like to first recognize Kevin Finnegan, who was a senior when I was a freshman in high school, who was very good to me growing up, someone who I've been able to develop a friendship with over the years, and someone I've been able to work with on a number of these initiatives, especially the Memphis Lacrosse Program.

66
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:58,456
[SPEAKER_07]: He's someone that's really put his money where his mouth is.

67
00:06:58,476 --> 00:07:03,117
[SPEAKER_07]: He's someone that's always been there to show that his actions speak louder than his words.

68
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:06,838
[SPEAKER_07]: A man of not much to say, but a lot to do.

69
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:08,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's someone that I admire, and he's a friend of mine.

70
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And I certainly wish him and his wife a great anniversary.

71
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:15,542
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 years is a great, great, great achievement that I congratulate them both.

72
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:26,615
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting them this evening in their celebration and also recognizing the work that they do in this community to make sure that Memphis is a place where we can all thrive.

73
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:30,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, thank you, Councilman for bringing this forward.

74
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:36,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I think between the Heath's and the Finnegan's, I think that there's a common bond here.

75
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:48,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Two couples have been married 20 plus years and also members of our community that are great examples of what a backbone of family people are all about.

76
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:56,236
[SPEAKER_06]: a good example of how to give back to the community and still maintain such a strong marriage and families.

77
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:59,479
[SPEAKER_06]: So I congratulate them and wish them happy 20.

78
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

79
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:01,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpello.

80
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:02,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

81
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:07,007
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by... Second.

82
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Behrs, all those in favor?

83
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:09,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

84
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:10,521
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

85
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:11,742
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion passes.

86
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:16,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations to the Peace and the Senegans.

87
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:17,924
[SPEAKER_03]: 22-090 offered by Councilor Caravaglio.

88
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:25,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the City Council reappoint City Messenger Lawrence Leopore for a term expiring on the first Monday of January 2024.

89
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caravaglio.

90
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

91
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:33,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's something that we've, a little bit of housekeeping, I think we forgot to do when we all got inaugurated.

92
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:41,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Larry's been here 28 years, and I think it's time we reappointed him for another couple more years, bring him up to 30.

93
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:52,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Larry, are you going to accept the guest?

94
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:56,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Larry's been here a long time, a lot longer than any of us have been here, and well-deserved.

95
00:08:56,684 --> 00:08:58,865
[SPEAKER_01]: He does a good job every week.

96
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:00,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone stays to our house or anything.

97
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:04,167
[SPEAKER_01]: So motion to reappoint Larry.

98
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:13,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam President, if I could also amend this, sort of falls under our thing, but if you and the clerk

99
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:24,481
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and the clerk could sit down with the mayor and talk about maybe an increase in pay for the young man who does our TV things every year.

100
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:30,306
[SPEAKER_01]: He's working two to three nights a week here and well underpaid for what he does.

101
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:38,653
[SPEAKER_01]: So under your guidance and between you and the clerk, you talk to the mayor about seeing about increasing his pay would be greatly appreciated.

102
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,976
[SPEAKER_01]: As a big paper.

103
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:46,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

104
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:47,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you again.

105
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Councilor Carvio.

106
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:53,163
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that shouldn't have gone unnoticed.

107
00:09:53,223 --> 00:10:05,292
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you have someone like Larry, he's been the the common denominator for politics in this hallowed hall, and we appreciate everything he does.

108
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:07,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that I know he had a long street going.

109
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:11,976
[SPEAKER_06]: before that ice storm left a few Fridays ago.

110
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:18,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I was pretty disappointed that he didn't make the trek out in two inches of ice and had to deliver on Saturday.

111
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:27,319
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could just ask if he could maybe bring a treat for now on so Gabby doesn't rip the couch apart when he drops off our papers.

112
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,499
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I second the motion.

113
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Larry and move approval.

114
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:39,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Scott Kelly, would that be something that he could put in his expense report that you know what, forget it.

115
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:40,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

116
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:44,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, you know, as a new counselor I wanted to.

117
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:52,813
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about how much Larry means to me.

118
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:58,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Larry's been super helpful with my deliveries, especially given my kind of wacky schedule.

119
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:03,279
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been able to work around that and I'm very, very thankful for that.

120
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:14,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm also super thankful that he's been such a welcoming person in the city council chambers since the first day that I got to my seat.

121
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:17,226
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very excited about this motion.

122
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:24,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Larry, congratulations and thank you for all you do.

123
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:35,816
[SPEAKER_07]: When you sit down and you think about 20 years of service, and then you look behind this rail and you look at this body combined we have 31 years behind this real combined 31 years of service Larry has 28 by himself.

124
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:38,999
[SPEAKER_07]: The institutional knowledge that this man possesses is amazing.

125
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:39,759
[SPEAKER_07]: He's seen it all.

126
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:42,141
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been at every single city council meeting for 28 years.

127
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have found you not guilty, Larry.

128
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:49,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have gave you parole a long time ago, literally.

129
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:58,530
[SPEAKER_07]: But the institutional knowledge that you possess and the friendship that you've shown me over the years has been something that's tremendous.

130
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Larry's a man of few words.

131
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:04,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you ask him a question, he'll certainly give you an answer and he's been here and seen it all.

132
00:12:04,476 --> 00:12:10,120
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a great resource to all of us and he's something that we need, especially when you see the transition through City Hall and the department heads and the like.

133
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,903
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we need someone that has an institutional knowledge that can guide us in the right direction, point us in the right way.

134
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:16,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And Larry's that person.

135
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:21,328
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the City Messenger's job is to deliver the papers and to make sure that we're

136
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:32,882
[SPEAKER_07]: informed with the provided with the materials that are necessary for us to prepare for the meeting but Larry does much more than that, and his title messenger does not necessarily reflect all that he does for this body.

137
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:35,545
[SPEAKER_07]: So Larry thank you very much I support this wholeheartedly.

138
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:39,349
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been a great friend for a long time and I wouldn't want anybody else sitting in that chair for you.

139
00:12:41,923 --> 00:13:01,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President, and my comments, very similar to Councilor Knights, which are just that if you have a question about what's happened in this city and you wanna compare something that's happening now to something that's happened basically the entire time we've had this charter, Larry's the person to talk to, and I'm grateful to have a lot of great conversations after our meetings with Larry.

140
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:04,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very supportive of this motion.

141
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:05,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Vice President Harris.

142
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

143
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:14,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I just go through the chair, I want to thank you, Larry, and I appreciate you, you know, the consistency and wanting to keep doing this job.

144
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:22,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you for letting me boot you out of your chair for a few months during the configuration was a little different here in the earlier days of COVID.

145
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's always a delight when we cross paths, when you're delivering the papers and, you know, my dog is also losing her mind.

146
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:30,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of,

147
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:34,790

148
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, we have a B paper first.

149
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:37,732
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take the B paper first.

150
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:42,476
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna take the B paper first.

151
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:43,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have the language for that B paper?

152
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:44,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

153
00:13:52,585 --> 00:14:04,873

[SPEAKER_03]: On the main paper offered by Councilor Carvilla, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

160
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:28,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lost everyone's second.

161
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:31,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, come on up first.

173
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Be sworn in.

174
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:44,527
[SPEAKER_10]: All the duties incumbent upon me as Medford City Messenger according to the best of my ability and understanding agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution.

175
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:46,369
[SPEAKER_10]: The laws of this Commonwealth

176
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:01,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Eric.

177
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:39,135
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you ready?

178
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:41,075
[SPEAKER_03]: 22-092, offered by Councilor Carviello.

179
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:52,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it so resolved that the administration start providing information to our residents on where they're able to get assistance with their heat and energy costs, not just fuel oil assistance, but assistance with both gas and electric heat related costs.

180
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:59,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it further resolved that we obtain a report on the cost of the aggregate electric contract compared to national grid.

181
00:16:59,379 --> 00:16:59,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Carviello.

182
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:01,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

183
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that,

184
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:09,380
[SPEAKER_01]: owns a home or has to pay for the heat in the house, I think has seen a giant increase.

185
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:20,946
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know in the past, we've had some assistance with fuel oil, but I don't know if anybody has gotten the gas bill lately, gas bill is through the roof, electric bill is through the roof.

186
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:27,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I know in the past we've had some programs there for fuel assistance.

187
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,811
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't include gas and electric heat.

188
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:43,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, maybe Alicia Hunt, she's the Energy and Environment Director, maybe she can provide us with a report if there are any funds available for the residents.

189
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:56,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's covered under, maybe some of that's covered under the APA agreement, but like I say, anybody that owns a house or apartment that pays rent and pays a giant increase no matter what your heat yield is.

190
00:17:56,929 --> 00:17:59,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Any help to the residents can be greatly appreciated.

191
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:01,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Favella.

192
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:02,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further, Councilor Collins.

193
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

194
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank Councilor Carvillo for bringing this up tonight.

195
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:17,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I was interested in this resolution because, you know, over the course of particularly in the past couple of years with the pandemic, from my work in the community, I've heard about different sorts of energy and fuel assistance programs.

196
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:24,160
[SPEAKER_09]: So I went on the city website to see, you know, what's current, what's available, what's easy to find, and it's not easy to find.

197
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:30,243
[SPEAKER_09]: So if those fuel assistance programs are available, we should make it really easy for people to find them because as you note,

198
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:33,421
[SPEAKER_09]: more and more people are in greater and greater need of them.

199
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:36,022
[SPEAKER_09]: We should make it easy, we should make it navigable, make it visible.

200
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:48,130
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really interested to hear that update from the administration, not just on what's available, but also on some of the programs that were really broadcasted during the peak of COVID, what's still relevant, and if not, what's taken that place.

201
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,532
[SPEAKER_09]: So looking forward to getting this update from the administration.

202
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

203
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:52,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

204
00:18:52,973 --> 00:18:53,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

205
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And just from the chair, I do know there is at least the state program LIHEAP.

206
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:02,139
[SPEAKER_03]: My father worked in that area for a very long time.

207
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:04,901
[SPEAKER_03]: That is one program, L-I-H-E-A-P.

208
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:09,664
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, as Councilor Cohn said, as you said, these are things the president should be able to find in one easy space.

209
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:12,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially if there are additional programs beyond the state level programs.

210
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:19,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam President, again, the other part is, we have that agreement with Good Energy.

211
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:26,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to know where we are with how those costs have gone compared to what national grid is.

212
00:19:26,854 --> 00:19:32,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know there are people that have been getting calls from other companies that are cheaper than what we're paying.

213
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:34,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to know where we stand with that.

214
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:35,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

215
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:36,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

216
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,226
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

217
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:42,427
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

218
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:43,948
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

219
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:46,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

220
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,691
[SPEAKER_03]: 22-093 offered by Councilor Carviello.

221
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:55,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Sylvia Bolden on her passing at 99 years old.

222
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:58,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Mrs. Bolden was a 98 year resident of Medford.

223
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Her presence in our community will be missed.

224
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Carviello.

225
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:02,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

226
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:05,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Mrs. Bolden, fixture in the community.

227
00:20:06,064 --> 00:20:18,494
[SPEAKER_01]: 98 years here, I mean, I mean, I mean people get to say that they lived here for 98 years, and people don't know the Baldwin family, her daughter is very instrumental with the hoops, hoops a dream by our project that Councilor Scott Pelley is involved with.

228
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:24,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if we could just send the condolences to her family on her passing.

229
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:43,281
[SPEAKER_06]: always giving back and definitely be missed and send our condolences to the Bolden family.

230

00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:36,724
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but again, we, again, we see everything in order.

276
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:38,045
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the hours of operations?

277
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:39,647
[SPEAKER_10]: So, 8 a.m.

278
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:43,792
[SPEAKER_03]: to 10 p.m., Monday through Thursday until midnight, Friday, Saturday, off on Sundays.

279
00:23:44,408 --> 00:23:56,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I know that it's a very popular place and it will be a well addition, an added addition to our community so if my colleagues don't have any questions I move approval tonight.

280
00:23:57,493 --> 00:23:58,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you say till 12pm.

281
00:23:58,714 --> 00:23:58,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

282
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:14,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so, so if we approve this from this evening you'd be able to operate from 7am to 11pm, anything after 11pm requiring extended hours permit, there needs to be approved with this console.

283
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:19,413
[SPEAKER_07]: So you need to fill out another separate application, and be able for us again for us to deliberate that issue.

284
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:23,948
[SPEAKER_07]: issue speaking as one member of this body.

285
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:28,188
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we were to approve this evening and then Friday night, you're open till midnight, that'd be a problem.

286
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,289
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just want to make you aware of that.

287
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:29,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

288
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:31,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So what would I have to do?

289
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I would do is see the clerk tomorrow, file for that.

290
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,710
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you come back in front of the body.

291
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually we approve it and maybe a 30 day review, 90 day review.

292
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:42,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there are no issues, we continue.

293
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:43,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see it being a problem.

294
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:43,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

295
00:24:44,012 --> 00:24:44,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

296
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:45,312
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

297
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:49,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So I move approval to 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, excuse me, 11 o'clock.

298
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:52,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

299
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:58,100
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve the petition with the hours being till 11 p.m.

300
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,761
[SPEAKER_03]: seconded by Councilor Knight.

301
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:00,981
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

302
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:02,202
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

303
00:25:02,862 --> 00:25:03,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

304
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:04,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

305
00:25:04,482 --> 00:25:04,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

306
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:07,423
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't mean that.

307
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:22,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Councilor, Vice-President Barrett to take the three papers under suspension.

308
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Second by Councilor Svang.

309
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:25,096
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

310
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:25,997
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

311
00:25:26,037 --> 00:25:26,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

312
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:28,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

313
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:29,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

314
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

315
00:25:37,724 --> 00:25:43,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Under suspension, 22-098, congratulations to the Chamber of Commerce Citizens of the Year for the years of 2020, 2021, and 2022.

316
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Councilor Kerrio, oh, I see.

317
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:54,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

318
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I can read the whole paper.

319
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:56,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

320
00:25:56,843 --> 00:25:58,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Over to Councilor Carviel.

321
00:25:58,205 --> 00:25:59,607
[SPEAKER_03]: These are resolved at the City Council.

322
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:05,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I commend and congratulate the Medford Chamber of Commerce on the selection of the 2020, 2021, and 2022 Citizens of the Year.

323
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:08,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford's first responders, Sam Carabelsi and Vinnie Fertura.

324
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:10,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

325
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:15,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to the Chamber of Commerce that has their usual banquet for the citizen of the year.

326
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:19,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to the pandemic, they haven't had it for the last two years.

327
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:25,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are planning to have it again this year in great selections for the citizens of the year.

328
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:35,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody knows how they get elected, but it's sent out to the community and people send in nominations to the chamber for people who

329
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:42,697
[SPEAKER_01]: who they feel are worthy and they get voted on by the past citizens.

330
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:48,239
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something about Memphis first responders was their first choice.

331
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,122
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everybody knows what a great job they did during the pandemic.

332
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:57,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam Terrabelsi from Lawrence Memorial and Hallmark Health.

333
00:26:58,124 --> 00:27:01,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam, you couldn't ask for a better person than Sam.

334
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:02,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam has kept the hospital

335
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,222
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalent in this community for many years.

336
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:09,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Without Sam, there'd be no Lawrence Memorial or anything to do with it.

337
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:10,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sam is there.

338
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,133
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a member of the Chamber of Commerce.

339
00:27:14,274 --> 00:27:18,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people think Sam even lives in Bedford, because he's here so much, but Sam's a great guy.

340
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Benny Futura.

341
00:27:20,243 --> 00:27:20,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

342
00:27:22,228 --> 00:27:24,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Vinny Futura, member of the Rotary.

343
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:32,352
[SPEAKER_01]: If there isn't anything anybody needs, they don't run to Vinny for, and Vinny's the first guy to help out anybody on the community.

344
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:33,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Good family.

345
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:37,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, all well-deserved, and I just want to congratulate all three of them.

346
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:37,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

347
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:38,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

348
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:43,297
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

349
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:44,097
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

350
00:27:44,637 --> 00:27:44,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

351
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:45,478
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

352
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:46,278
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion passes.

353
00:27:47,781 --> 00:28:04,347
[SPEAKER_03]: 22 dash 099 offered under suspension by counselor night, be it so resolved that the city council extend its deep and sincere condolences on the family of trooper tomorrow Gucci and her extended family at the Massachusetts State Police Wellington barracks on her recent passing counselor night, Madam President, thank you very much if any of us.

354
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:08,792
[SPEAKER_07]: have been paying attention to the recent ongoings and current events here in the community.

355
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:15,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Just recently, one of our state troopers from the Wellington Barracks was critically injured in a motor vehicle accident on Route 93.

356
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:21,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Her services are actually being held this evening up at, I believe, St.

357
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:23,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony's Church in Urbana.

358
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:29,553
[SPEAKER_07]: But Trupa Bucci was a 34-year-old state trooper who was relatively new on the job.

359
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:45,283
[SPEAKER_07]: She had a career prior life working over at Encore Casino as a security specialist over there with a number of Metro residents that I know very well, including Arthur Simmons and Jason Wong, for example, who called me to express their concern over the circumstances surrounding this terrible accident.

360
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:50,567
[SPEAKER_07]: My life was taken well too short due to a preventable motor vehicle accident.

361
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:54,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's all too common that we see the way that people drive on the roadways.

362
00:28:55,430 --> 00:29:06,219
[SPEAKER_07]: The condition of our roads, the circumstances that led to this event show that a lot of it has to do less with driver training and less with driver responsibility than it does with actual design.

363
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:09,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And we sat here last week, we talked about Vision Zero.

364
00:29:10,107 --> 00:29:16,093
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about using design to make our roads safer because sometimes there's just nothing we can do to prevent an accident.

365
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:25,043
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you hear about the circumstances surrounding this incident, I think it's safe to say that the truck driver was not necessarily at fault, and this was an accident that just occurred.

366
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,546
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really something that was almost preventable, unpreventable.

367
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:31,169
[SPEAKER_07]: But to lose a trooper at age 34 years,

368
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,033
[SPEAKER_07]: with so much potential and so much life ahead of her.

369
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,694
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that's very sad.

370
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:39,735
[SPEAKER_07]: She suited up every day to make sure that this community was safe.

371
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:44,358
[SPEAKER_07]: She was stationed right here in our city, and she responded to the calls that we all make.

372
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:51,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's very important for us to recognize the sacrifices that she's made sacrifices that her family made through her service.

373
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:55,366
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I asked my council colleagues for this resolution, and I'm sending

374
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:03,696
[SPEAKER_07]: family of tomorrow G, not only her personal family but also extended family at the Masters of State barrack state his back to.

375
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:09,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President, thank you Councilor night for bringing this forward.

376
00:30:10,782 --> 00:30:16,468
[SPEAKER_04]: He took the word right in my mouth, I was going to mention the circumstances here and you know vision zero and design and I think.

377
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:26,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Too often we hear tragic and unfortunate when it comes to something like this, when it really should be, how can we change the conditions of our roads to make sure that this doesn't happen?

378
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a personal issue to me.

379
00:30:28,365 --> 00:30:29,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for bringing this forward.

380
00:30:30,187 --> 00:30:30,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Vice President Bares.

381
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:31,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

382
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:35,931
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Nice, seconded by Councilor Carviel.

383
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:36,612
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

384
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:37,813
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

385
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:38,554
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion passes.

386
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:39,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

387
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:11,090
[SPEAKER_03]: 22.0 100 offered under suspension my counselor night, it's a result of the Medford City Council extended steep and sincere condolences, the family of William Boyd on his recent passing counselor night.

388
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:16,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Now Madam President, thank you very much and I do believe the councilor Scott Kelly is a co sponsor of this resolution.

389
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Just recently, Mr Boyd passed away.

390
00:31:20,372 --> 00:31:27,335
[SPEAKER_07]: someone who lived in the city of Medford for, geez, got to be 70 years, was a military veteran and just an all-around good person.

391
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,876
[SPEAKER_07]: His son, Buzzer, and I are very close friends.

392
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:41,221
[SPEAKER_07]: His son, Billy, was just elected not too long ago to the New Hampshire State Legislature, and the city council had honored him on this achievement as a high school graduate, getting elected to the New Hampshire State Legislature.

393
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:46,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you can tell, he's a proud father who raised a good family of public servants.

394
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:50,106
[SPEAKER_07]: He was, as I said, was a veteran, as was his son, Bowser, after him.

395
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:52,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And recently he passed away.

396
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:53,647
[SPEAKER_07]: He will be sadly missed.

397
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:55,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Boyd was quite a character.

398
00:31:56,568 --> 00:32:03,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I fondly remember a conversation that I had with him when the tree in front of his house was removed and he called and wanted the tree replaced.

399
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:10,611
[SPEAKER_07]: So I reached out to forestry department and I asked that they replace a tree in front of the Boyd's house.

400
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:13,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And they went down and they replaced the tree.

401
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:14,312
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. Boyd called me.

402
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:16,186
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, what the hell is this?

403
00:32:16,486 --> 00:32:19,948
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you saw what this was, it was Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.

404
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:22,569
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the funniest looking little tree I'd ever see.

405
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:25,971
[SPEAKER_07]: It was maybe eight inches tall and didn't have a leave on it.

406
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:28,812
[SPEAKER_07]: And me and Mr. Boyd just laughed and laughed and laughed.

407
00:32:28,852 --> 00:32:33,074
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of the funniest things that this happened to me in government service.

408
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:38,117
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you call and you ask them to plant a tree and the gentleman says, the trees come in and we're all excited about the tree coming and then

409
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:39,478
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is, you know what I mean?

410
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,079
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little twig sticking out of the ground.

411
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:44,241
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't know whether it was supposed to water it or pull it out.

412
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:47,083
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just, it was a really funny circumstance.

413
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:48,404
[SPEAKER_07]: And he and I laughed about it.

414
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:50,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And his son and I laughed about it as well.

415
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:51,546
[SPEAKER_07]: But just a great person.

416
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:53,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I take it from us, well, far too soon.

417
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:58,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of us that live in the Salem Street area would see him driving around in his beautiful Corvette.

418
00:32:58,868 --> 00:33:01,389
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when we know that Mr. Boyd was out and about.

419
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:11,854
[SPEAKER_07]: But with that being said, I'd just like to ask my council colleagues to extend a note of condolence to the family for a United States military veteran who's served our country and served this community so well.

420
00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:16,156
[SPEAKER_07]: He's raised two civic-minded children in Buzzard Valley.

421
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:23,039
[SPEAKER_07]: One's a state rep, the other one's a veterans advocate up at Post 45, and they've both done great things for this community as well as their father.

422
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in this resolution.

423
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:26,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

424
00:33:30,082 --> 00:33:40,324
[SPEAKER_06]: A sad day, Mr. Boyd was a true hero, a veteran, someone who loved Medford.

425
00:33:40,904 --> 00:33:48,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. and Mrs. Boyd had two children and they raised them to love the city of Medford and love their country.

426
00:33:48,845 --> 00:33:52,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one thing, if you know Buzzer and you know Billy, that's what they're all about.

427
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:58,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Billy and I were classmates at Medford High School in class of 87 and nobody could,

428
00:33:59,128 --> 00:33:59,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody could.

429
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:05,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody could tell Billy he could bring his trumpet to any event and play the fight song.

430
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:10,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that Mr. Boyd instilled in his children.

431
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:12,797
[SPEAKER_06]: And he'll be sadly missed.

432
00:34:12,857 --> 00:34:24,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that he's gone through a tough time the last couple of years, but he was definitely a fighter and appreciate everything he's done for our community and our country.

433
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:28,720
[SPEAKER_06]: And we send our condolences to the Boyd brothers.

434
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,682
[SPEAKER_06]: wish them well, it's difficult times.

435
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:33,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

436
00:34:33,263 --> 00:34:33,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

437
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:38,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli all those in favor.

438
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:40,049
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed.

439
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes please rise for a moment of silence.

440
00:34:56,793 --> 00:35:01,156
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Vice President Behrs to revert to regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Seng.

441
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:01,817
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

442
00:35:02,037 --> 00:35:02,977
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

443
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:03,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

444
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Communications from the Mayor 22-094, March 3rd, 2022.

445
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:24,513
[SPEAKER_03]: To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding the American Rescue Plan Act ARPA, dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request that your Honorable body allocate time for a presentation on a topic of the American Rescue Plan Act ARPA

446
00:35:24,993 --> 00:35:28,374
[SPEAKER_03]: to allow our Federal Funds Manager, Molly Kivy, the time to present to the Council.

447
00:35:28,854 --> 00:35:30,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

448
00:35:30,514 --> 00:35:32,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, Brianna Longo Kern, Mayor.

449
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:39,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's just a, it's a presentation, correct?

450
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:43,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's a presentation.

451
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:47,258
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting nods from the USF and Federal Funds Manager.

452
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Molly, if you'd like to go to the podium.

453
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:59,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for this time, Madam President, and hello, city councilors.

454
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,733
[SPEAKER_11]: At this time, I will share my screen.

455
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:06,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you could just share your name and address for the record as well.

456
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:07,374
[SPEAKER_03]: City Hall is fine.

457
00:36:07,594 --> 00:36:08,074
[SPEAKER_03]: City Hall address.

458
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:09,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Just name and address for the record.

459
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:16,256
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Molly Kippy, and my address is... You can give your City Hall address.

460
00:36:16,596 --> 00:36:16,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

461
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:18,676
[SPEAKER_11]: You can give your City Hall address.

462
00:36:18,716 --> 00:36:19,376
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't... Oh, 308.

463
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's true, yeah.

464
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, okay.

465
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:26,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, okay.

466
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:54,685
[SPEAKER_11]: So today I will be presenting on Medford's American Rescue Plan Act today, also known as ARPA.

467
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I am here to answer any questions at the end of this presentation.

468
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:08,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Firstly, I will be defining what ARPA is, the spirit behind it, eligibility and ineligible uses, and framing project narratives.

469
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:16,901
[SPEAKER_11]: I will then share the community engagement plan for the next year, which is a defining piece of the strategic spending plan.

470
00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:25,066
[SPEAKER_11]: ARPA is a COVID relief bill, a bill to help remedy the harm from the last two years.

471
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:39,270
[SPEAKER_11]: The spirit of ARPA is to help fight the pandemic and support municipalities, individuals, families and businesses struggling with the pandemic, with the public health and negative economic impacts.

472
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:45,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Maintain vital public services among decline in revenue and build a strong,

473
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:51,794
[SPEAKER_11]: resilient and equitable recovery by making investments that support long-term growth and opportunity.

474
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:59,719
[SPEAKER_11]: The federal government released 1.9 trillion in funds to stimulate the economy back in March of 2021.

475
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,104
[SPEAKER_11]: These funds are making their way to individuals, families, municipalities, and businesses in a number of avenues.

476
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:09,686
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, Medford has been earmarked

477
00:38:10,076 --> 00:38:16,800
[SPEAKER_11]: to receive 1.2 million for state ARPA-funded projects in addition to direct federal funding.

478
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:26,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Today, we'll be focusing on coronavirus local fiscal recovery dollars, or $48 million.

479
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:32,829
[SPEAKER_11]: ARPA was signed into law in March of 2021.

480
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:35,831
[SPEAKER_11]: The first set of guidance was released in May 2021.

481
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:38,852
[SPEAKER_11]: The final rule was issued this past January in 2022.

482
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:45,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Just last week, the Department of the Treasury released updates on compliance and program guidance.

483
00:38:46,053 --> 00:38:47,953
[SPEAKER_11]: The final rule is 500 pages.

484
00:38:48,513 --> 00:38:55,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Cities and administrators are tasked with building programs as changing guidance emerges and additional allocations received.

485
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:03,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford is taking careful and thorough approach when creating plans for funds as to avoid duplication of efforts and funding sources.

486
00:39:04,498 --> 00:39:11,902
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, the state of Massachusetts still has $2 billion in state relief funds to allocate to cities and towns this year.

487
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:17,345
[SPEAKER_11]: 2026 is the spending deadline.

488
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:22,448
[SPEAKER_11]: This creates a fiscal cliff for any social programs, staffing, projects funded by ARPA.

489
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:29,372
[SPEAKER_11]: The deadline also means that when budgeting, projecting up to 2026 is important.

490
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:32,093
[SPEAKER_11]: We are mindful that these funds have an expiration date.

491
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:40,499
[SPEAKER_11]: There are four very broad categories in ARPA, responding to the public health emergency being the largest.

492
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:46,762
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a non-exhausted list of prohibited uses.

493
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:54,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Funds cannot be used to offset a tax cut, pensions, loans, settlements, cash reserves, or stabilization funds.

494
00:39:57,026 --> 00:40:04,649
[SPEAKER_11]: This section will go over a non-exhausted list of eligible uses broken out into, in the four sections of the final rule.

495
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:14,305
[SPEAKER_11]: This first section shows outlined programs as described by the Treasury to remedy the harm caused to impacted populations.

496
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:24,268
[SPEAKER_11]: This includes public health, support staff, direct aid to the business community, impacted business community, and direct aid to individuals.

497
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:35,192
[SPEAKER_11]: This second section shows outlined programs as described by the Department of Treasury to remedy disproportionately impacted populations.

498
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:46,073
[SPEAKER_11]: This includes educational disparities like learning loss, investments in neighborhoods, community health, and long-term financial security programs.

499
00:40:51,354 --> 00:40:54,915
[SPEAKER_11]: This slide shows compliance isn't necessarily about the program idea.

500
00:40:55,475 --> 00:41:02,037
[SPEAKER_11]: It is first and foremost about identifying the public health or economic impact caused or exacerbated by the pandemic.

501
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:14,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Then after identifying the harm, identifying the individual, population, or business as an impacted group or disproportionately impacted group, then using a program from the Treasury's guidance to remedy that harm.

502
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:22,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Knowing whether a group is impacted or disproportionately impacted either narrows or expands the programs available.

503
00:41:29,994 --> 00:41:31,755
[SPEAKER_11]: This second section is revenue replacement.

504
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:40,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Revenue replacement is based on a formula provided by the treasury to estimate how much the tax base shrunk during the public health crisis.

505
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:48,180
[SPEAKER_11]: These funds can be used for anything categorized as a government service, like administration, education, and public safety.

506
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:52,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Premium pay is the third section.

507
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:57,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Premium pay, also known as low-income essential worker pay, these funds are

508
00:41:57,919 --> 00:42:07,426
[SPEAKER_11]: designated as an economic remedy for people who do not earn a living wage, a population who were specifically harmed by the public health crisis.

509
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:16,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Fortunately, the state is using 500 million of its ARPA funds to fund low income essential employee pay.

510
00:42:17,094 --> 00:42:21,177
[SPEAKER_11]: This takes away the administrative burden on municipalities and is best fit

511
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:28,399
[SPEAKER_11]: which is best fit for the state to handle because cities and towns do not have access to tax data needed to identify these individuals.

512
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:37,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to take this opportunity to announce that the state is issuing $500 checks starting this March.

513
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:43,628
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, an individual making $38,000 will receive a check and a family of four making $78,000 or less will be receiving a check.

514
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:52,713
[SPEAKER_11]: To learn more, please follow the link on the slide.

515
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:57,515
[SPEAKER_11]: And slides will be posted on medford.org.

516
00:43:00,756 --> 00:43:04,837
[SPEAKER_11]: The fourth and final section is infrastructure, particularly water, sewer, and broadband.

517
00:43:05,158 --> 00:43:10,640
[SPEAKER_11]: The federal government believes that communities having access to clean water and information are essential to healthy communities.

518
00:43:13,061 --> 00:43:16,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Funds can be used for construction, subsidies, grants, and classes.

519
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:25,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Community engagement is an important component to the information gathering step for the strategic ARPA implementation.

520
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:36,579
[SPEAKER_11]: The purpose is to develop base knowledge for all stakeholders, try to engage all populations, explore community priorities, and share data with all stakeholders.

521
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:44,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Activities will focus on sharing where emergency spending is going and creating accessible activities for residents to share their values.

522
00:43:47,564 --> 00:44:01,150
[SPEAKER_11]: effort to bring equity to this process, Medford will focus on creating community relationships as to reach as many Medford residents as possible, offer translated materials, de-technicalized language, and share information through a number of sources.

523
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:07,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Types of communication that will be used on the website will be

524
00:44:09,435 --> 00:44:18,147
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford government website Medford community media city hall department email list newsletters public spaces, the phone social media and in person interactions.

525
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:26,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Specific activities for community engagement include community survey community meetings and an outreach series.

526
00:44:29,898 --> 00:44:39,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford plans on releasing a multilingual survey this spring, conduct an outreach series over the summer, close the survey in the fall, and have analysis out in the winter.

527
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:41,972
[SPEAKER_11]: The project selection process starting in 2023.

528
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:50,482
[SPEAKER_11]: What has been spent and how will funding be allocated?

529
00:44:52,420 --> 00:45:02,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently COVID testing, specifically rapid tests are available to vulnerable populations distributed at West Medford Community Center, the Senior Center and Medford Housing Authority.

530
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:10,091
[SPEAKER_11]: COVID mitigation, like computers for work from home and COVID safe water filling stations for students.

531
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:15,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Next, funding has been spent on community outreach workers.

532
00:45:16,835 --> 00:45:21,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Also on wastewater construction at James, Swamp, Goldsmith and Main Street.

533
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:24,409
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, the lead rebate program.

534
00:45:27,151 --> 00:45:32,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Four elements are crucial when planning spending objectives.

535
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:36,576
[SPEAKER_11]: One, public feedback and values.

536
00:45:37,016 --> 00:45:38,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Two, emergency needs.

537
00:45:38,657 --> 00:45:40,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Three, project readiness.

538
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:44,580
[SPEAKER_11]: And four, understanding previous priorities identified in earlier processes.

539
00:45:46,589 --> 00:45:53,192
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, priorities identified in the Capital Improvement Report, Medford Comprehensive Plan, and the Medford Climate Report.

540
00:45:54,072 --> 00:45:57,273
[SPEAKER_11]: All of these and more can be found at medford.org.

541
00:45:59,954 --> 00:46:03,536
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a visualization on how feedback from the public will be used.

542
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:09,618
[SPEAKER_11]: So feedback mixed with emergency needs, department priorities, and previous plans will all be mixed together.

543
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:14,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we'll check for project readiness and

544
00:46:15,404 --> 00:46:17,186
[SPEAKER_11]: it's ready, then that will be funded.

545
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:26,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally, updates and ways to get involved can be found at medford.org.

546
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:36,428
[SPEAKER_11]: In conclusion, here are some projects that have been shared by local and similar cities to Medford.

547
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:40,331
[SPEAKER_11]: The money has not started flowing yet for many of these projects.

548
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:49,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Setting up these programs are taking municipalities a lot of time as we figure out capacity issues, operational procedures, and learn updated treasury guidance.

549
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:57,241
[SPEAKER_11]: These projects exemplify a mix between direct aid, government service improvements, and business supports.

550
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:02,834
[SPEAKER_11]: I will stop sharing my screen now, but I am available for questions.

551
00:47:07,497 --> 00:47:08,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

552
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:09,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the presentation.

553
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:11,160
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of questions.

554
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:11,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

555
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:16,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw something about pay to go projects.

556
00:47:17,345 --> 00:47:19,366
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be considered a pay to go project?

557
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:20,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Pay to go project.

558
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:25,191
[SPEAKER_11]: That means that a loan has not been taken out to fund that project.

559
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,893
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a project that we are

560
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:34,164
[SPEAKER_11]: literally paying for it as it's being- Can you give me an example of something that you would be considering?

561
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:34,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Construction.

562
00:47:36,085 --> 00:47:36,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Construction of?

563
00:47:36,986 --> 00:47:43,731
[SPEAKER_11]: So currently there is a wastewater project that is happening at Swamp, Goldsmith and Main, and that is a pay go project.

564
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:46,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

565
00:47:47,194 --> 00:47:54,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And the essential workers under the premium pay program, how are we going to identify

566
00:47:55,716 --> 00:47:58,877
[SPEAKER_01]: those workers, I mean, do you have to live in Medford or just work in Medford?

567
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:06,700
[SPEAKER_11]: We are still looking over the guidance on essential employee pay, essential worker pay.

568
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, does that cover private business employees also?

569
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:17,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Private business, I mean, you know, like if you work the stop and shop, you know, is that considered?

570
00:48:18,664 --> 00:48:20,445
[SPEAKER_11]: It does include private sector.

571
00:48:21,008 --> 00:48:26,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And do those people that work in the private sector have to live in Medford to get that funding?

572
00:48:28,053 --> 00:48:30,534
[SPEAKER_11]: So if it's Medford funding, yes.

573
00:48:30,734 --> 00:48:33,416
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a Medford company, but what if they don't live in Medford?

574
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:34,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they eligible?

575
00:48:34,637 --> 00:48:42,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I still need to- Are they eligible for the funds or is it just regulated to people that work in Medford businesses that live in Medford?

576
00:48:42,922 --> 00:48:46,825
[SPEAKER_11]: I will definitely consult with our consultants on that and check out the guidance.

577
00:48:46,865 --> 00:48:47,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

578
00:48:51,227 --> 00:48:52,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the presentation, Molly.

579
00:48:54,588 --> 00:48:56,709
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we did, I just wanted to see.

580
00:48:57,829 --> 00:49:07,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if this is similar to the presentation you might be giving tomorrow, but we spent 8.6 million of the ARPA money on revenue recovery in fiscal 22.

581
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:08,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just wondering if

582
00:49:10,277 --> 00:49:12,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't see it in the list of things that we had spent money on.

583
00:49:13,198 --> 00:49:22,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And so is that a non-exhaustive list of things that money had been spent on, or is it just that that one piece, that revenue recovery piece wasn't included in the list?

584
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:25,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a relatively fair statement.

585
00:49:25,243 --> 00:49:33,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a non-exhaustive list because the revenue replacement aspect just wasn't the same scale as the other items that were being presented, but certainly the 8.6.

586
00:49:33,967 --> 00:49:34,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, great.

587
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:36,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, you know, I think,

588
00:49:37,648 --> 00:49:49,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are going to be surprised when they see, looking at the revenue replacement formula from the final rule, just how much revenue we lost and just how much of the 48 million is probably going to end up in a revenue replacement fund.

589
00:49:49,932 --> 00:49:55,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that might be a good thing to let people know, you know, we see 48 million people think all our problems are solved.

590
00:49:55,554 --> 00:50:01,777
[SPEAKER_04]: If we end up spending 32 of a million of that on revenue replacement, then the pool for the PAYGO programs is much smaller.

591
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:04,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just my one piece of feedback, but thank you for the presentation.

592
00:50:07,593 --> 00:50:10,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Council President and thank you for being here tonight.

593
00:50:10,596 --> 00:50:17,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the question I have is, I work in municipality, and I work as the acting director of recreation.

594
00:50:18,426 --> 00:50:27,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing we're seeing is we're seeing a huge gap with parents going back to work and being home that had young children that had coverage.

595
00:50:28,494 --> 00:50:41,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that moving out and you have both parents with two family house that children left without assistance after school and something that we're working on in my community that I'm working in, but something that

596
00:50:42,365 --> 00:50:59,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the Director of Recreation, Kevin, is working right now with one of the phone calls, a bunch of phone calls we've received about the same issue, which is the voucher, the families that have voucher programs are being accepted into afterschool programs.

597
00:50:59,497 --> 00:51:06,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have the families that have funding to pay the expensive fees for an afterschool program.

598
00:51:06,742 --> 00:51:09,144
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's left now is a huge gap

599
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:14,288
[SPEAKER_06]: of families that really never needed after school care.

600
00:51:14,888 --> 00:51:16,790
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're seeing a huge disparity now.

601
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:23,975
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll be working closely with with the director and working with him and sharing some of our ideas.

602
00:51:24,476 --> 00:51:29,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that in in my community where I'm working, we're actually

603
00:51:30,224 --> 00:51:42,573
[SPEAKER_06]: taking over an afterschool program for low-income middle school boys and girls, and we're hoping to use the ARPA money to assist us with those gaps.

604
00:51:43,074 --> 00:51:52,061
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question I have, would that be something that the parents and the director could come to the body and ask for assistance?

605
00:51:52,081 --> 00:51:53,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that fall into the category here in Memphis?

606
00:51:53,802 --> 00:51:58,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that we're looking at as you see these concerns that we're seeing and these gaps now?

607
00:52:00,258 --> 00:52:07,869
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like that that is like you identified a harm that that was caused by the pandemic so I would say, definitely something to bring.

608
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:08,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's great.

609
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:17,221
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great to you so it's going to be this I appreciate the presentation because you really shared a lot here and it's something that I think as we move on to the community.

610
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:22,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something they can they can use in different departments can use to assist to fill in those gaps.

611
00:52:22,845 --> 00:52:30,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know I'll be bothering the chief of staff in the mayor's office and asking to assist in any way I can to help with that gap.

612
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate all your hard work.

613
00:52:32,591 --> 00:52:43,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is I know that Council B has brought up a very, very good point where it's the hidden, you know, everybody thinks that we're getting every penny is going to go to everything we need is going to fix everything.

614
00:52:43,157 --> 00:52:47,220
[SPEAKER_06]: But we should really understand where that money's coming from where it's already earmarked.

615
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:47,360
[SPEAKER_06]: So

616
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,421
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you again for all your hard work.

617
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:49,961
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.

618
00:52:50,821 --> 00:53:04,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I will just mention as a caveat with any of these programs, there will be, we need to set like income eligibility requirements and there is data that needs to be reported to the Department of Treasury to keep it all compliant.

619
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:11,671
[SPEAKER_11]: So it isn't always straightforward, but that is definitely like a harm or an impact that can be remedied through these funds.

620
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:14,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure that's easy to do.

621
00:53:14,212 --> 00:53:16,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

622
00:53:20,223 --> 00:53:20,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

623
00:53:20,563 --> 00:53:22,845
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, Molly, for that very thorough presentation.

624
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:31,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited to hear that the slides will be available online because there's a lot to plumb through and I'm sure I'll be revisiting it to get caught up on all the nuts and bolts.

625
00:53:31,553 --> 00:53:36,877
[SPEAKER_09]: You answered a lot of the questions that I had in terms of what specific programs are and aren't eligible.

626
00:53:37,938 --> 00:53:42,402
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that's on my mind, which I'm sure is one of the many things that isn't yet set in stone is

627
00:53:43,523 --> 00:53:46,847
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of a more specific timeline for the community engagement piece.

628
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:59,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the questions that I've been hearing from residents are, you know, it's so great that this is going to be a participatory process, but what is it going to look like and how will I know that my feedback is being, you know, really incorporated, not just received and then

629
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:01,523
[SPEAKER_09]: put in a filing cabinet somewhere.

630
00:54:02,484 --> 00:54:22,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure the timeline for making those decisions is still being finessed, but do you have any sort of preliminary thoughts about, you know, if there's lots of ideas that are compelling and meet the requirements and perhaps are mentioned in a previous program like the social justice roadmap or the Medford comprehensive plan, what the

631
00:54:24,104 --> 00:54:30,346
[SPEAKER_09]: what the decision process will be like for prioritizing among many good ideas.

632
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:35,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that's not a today question, that's also fine.

633
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:38,128
[SPEAKER_11]: The timeline for community input will be the spring.

634
00:54:38,148 --> 00:54:43,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Then there'll be a community outreach series in the summer.

635
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:49,952
[SPEAKER_11]: That data will then be collected, analyzed, and released in the winter.

636
00:54:51,113 --> 00:55:04,829
[SPEAKER_11]: As that, as we move through this year, the administration will be looking at what like what's what's needed emergency wise and those projects and that funding will be what will be public facing and announced.

637
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I had quite similar questions to my colleagues on that point.

638
00:55:16,086 --> 00:55:21,991
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned that it would be released, will it be posted on the city website, on the ARPA website, perhaps?

639
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:23,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

640
00:55:23,873 --> 00:55:24,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, awesome.

641
00:55:25,314 --> 00:55:35,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently, we have, the slides will be up this week, and there is a community engagement timeline, and there's some background information on ARPA.

642
00:55:36,643 --> 00:55:37,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

643
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:45,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you mentioned the administration will go through and see what's an emergency, what's not, what projects are ready to go.

644
00:55:46,113 --> 00:55:49,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Will the administration perhaps be open to

645
00:55:51,132 --> 00:55:55,635
[SPEAKER_05]: explaining a little bit when the time comes, like why certain projects are chosen.

646
00:55:55,655 --> 00:56:04,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it goes to kind of Councilor Collins's point where like some residents might feel, you know, this project seems ready to go.

647
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:05,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Why wasn't it chosen?

648
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:13,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Would the administration have the capacity to kind of explain to citizens on the website?

649
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:15,688
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely a fantastic question.

650
00:56:16,709 --> 00:56:16,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,

651
00:56:17,585 --> 00:56:31,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think through how that might unfold and trying to think through scenarios, you know, you know, obviously from a time standpoint, you know, Q amp a might be able to be developed on.

652
00:56:32,137 --> 00:56:44,943
[SPEAKER_02]: circumstances that's more generic, but I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I'm not prepared to commit because frankly, I'm still learning about all the different avenues and aspects and types of requests that might come in.

653
00:56:45,303 --> 00:56:50,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be easy to say, well, this item was not eligible and therefore it could not be funded.

654
00:56:50,205 --> 00:57:01,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be relatively easy to develop a Q and A going through, depending upon the volume we received, depending upon, you know, the number of inquiries we received,

655
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:06,232
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's just it may be difficult, maybe burdensome for an already strapped process.

656
00:57:07,213 --> 00:57:09,194
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think it's really great input.

657
00:57:09,254 --> 00:57:14,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something we should look at that just I'm not prepared to answer the question because we're in uncharted territory, to be honest.

658
00:57:15,335 --> 00:57:15,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand.

659
00:57:16,236 --> 00:57:25,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I guess my last point was, um, you talked a lot about, you know, like a community engagement and also a lot about, um, looking at what other communities are doing.

660
00:57:25,801 --> 00:57:36,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we kind of looked at what other communities are doing and how other communities in the past have done with regards to like participatory budgeting when it comes to engaging the community in the process, perhaps?

661
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:38,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you had a list of like a

662
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:46,035
[SPEAKER_05]: probably the most specific list I've seen so far about community outreach that our city will do.

663
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:55,483
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, have you guys been looking at what other communities have been doing, what other kind of communities in the past have been doing in processes like this?

664
00:57:56,023 --> 00:57:59,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to clarify, just make sure that I heard you.

665
00:58:00,087 --> 00:58:06,112
[SPEAKER_11]: What you're wondering is if we have researched what other local communities have done to receive community feedback.

666
00:58:06,936 --> 00:58:12,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, focused on local communities, but also open to other communities going through similar processes.

667
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:14,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

668
00:58:14,142 --> 00:58:26,973
[SPEAKER_11]: That is how the community survey was developed, how the outreach series was developed, and also this meeting and future community meetings.

669
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:28,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

670
00:58:28,651 --> 00:58:30,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited to see your work.

671
00:58:31,093 --> 00:58:33,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Very excited to see, you know, the fruits of your labor.

672
00:58:34,957 --> 00:58:38,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have confidence in this process going forward.

673
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much.

674
00:58:41,793 --> 00:58:44,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President, three more things came up in my head.

675
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:56,956
[SPEAKER_04]: But not to just keep being a broken record on the revenue replacement piece, but is the thought that that will be estimated out through December 2026.

676
00:58:59,437 --> 00:59:03,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how much revenue we expect to replace in each fiscal year just because I think again,

677
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:24,240
[SPEAKER_04]: The last thing we want to do is commit to fund a project, but then come back and say, either we can't fund that project, because we need to use this for revenue replacement, or say, we have a $500,001 million deficit on the budget, I mean because that 8.6 million was incredibly important to preventing teacher layoffs and staff layoffs and program cuts so

678
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:43,809
[SPEAKER_04]: is the thought that you'd say, so for fiscal 23, we'll need this much, fiscal 24, we'll need this much, fiscal 25, we'll need this much, fiscal 26, and then subtract that out and say, so that's the chunk that we're gonna need using this formula, and that leaves this chunk that we can use for other projects, or just what's the approach gonna be?

679
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:49,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great question, especially because it's one that's been on all of our minds.

680
00:59:49,732 --> 00:59:53,554
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been one that we've been looking at, talking about revenue replacement has been

681
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:56,031
[SPEAKER_02]: a big part of the discussions we've been having.

682
00:59:56,051 --> 01:00:01,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's all about looking at some of the trends that have occurred.

683
01:00:02,014 --> 01:00:08,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And the trends that we were seeing at the early stage of the pandemic may be very different than the trends we're seeing today.

684
01:00:08,978 --> 01:00:14,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And so analyzing them as they go, and as we learn more information is a critical piece to this puzzle.

685
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:21,565
[SPEAKER_02]: We're presently in the initial stages of starting the budgetary process, which means we're also beginning the process to estimate revenue.

686
01:00:22,177 --> 01:00:44,935
[SPEAKER_02]: be better informed about that once we do the revenue estimations for fiscal 23 and then perhaps that process plus further guidance from the state and other guidance on trends that you know communities are seeing as far as revenue impacts will be better you know in terms of helping us glean what the future holds for revenue replacement in the out years

687
01:00:45,763 --> 01:00:45,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

688
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:46,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

689
01:00:46,364 --> 01:00:51,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, you know, I think we're all hopeful that it goes, you know, 8.65210.

690
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:57,254
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it goes 8.6, 8.6, 8.6, 8.6 for five years, that's all the money, you know?

691
01:00:58,295 --> 01:01:00,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just something that's on my mind.

692
01:01:01,498 --> 01:01:07,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Second piece, and this is, I know this is a presentation on ARPA, but you are the federal funds manager.

693
01:01:07,924 --> 01:01:08,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any inkling

694
01:01:09,954 --> 01:01:19,842
[SPEAKER_04]: of when like infrastructure bill funding may be headed our way, or is that in the next three months or six months or 12 months?

695
01:01:20,423 --> 01:01:25,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously you've been hard at work on ARPA, so if it's just hasn't, you haven't gotten there yet, I understand that.

696
01:01:26,227 --> 01:01:28,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not gotten to read the infrastructure bill yet.

697
01:01:28,529 --> 01:01:29,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, gotcha.

698
01:01:31,612 --> 01:01:38,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last thing, it's a very specific comment, but again, if you're gonna use this presentation going forward and post it on the website,

699
01:01:40,103 --> 01:01:45,367
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I personally, and I think other people may have a visceral reaction to the funnel diagram.

700
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:54,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Just from a total design standpoint, maybe look at like circles with plus signs between them instead of the funnel, because I think people might see the funnel as a wastebasket.

701
01:01:56,556 --> 01:02:00,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just totally random thought, but it just came to my head immediately.

702
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:07,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I understood what your intent was, but I think other people, for whatever reason, may see it differently.

703
01:02:08,026 --> 01:02:09,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that feedback.

704
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:09,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

705
01:02:10,405 --> 01:02:11,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Councillor Riveras.

706
01:02:12,189 --> 01:02:25,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, this is a question that popped in my into my mind while concert bears talking because I'm, I think it's tied to this idea of economics at a greater level, but I'm obviously inflation is something that's on everyone's mind right now.

707
01:02:26,712 --> 01:02:37,875
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, you know, inflation is the best job we can't we can't do anything but we can you know economists have said that perhaps or there are ways that we could really alleviate some inflationary pressures.

708
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:41,856
[SPEAKER_05]: This is city have a sense of what areas are

709
01:02:42,556 --> 01:02:53,219
[SPEAKER_05]: workable in terms of what we can do about relieving some of those inflationary pressures with regards to funds like these?

710
01:02:54,679 --> 01:03:01,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Or would the city be able to study this going forward with an eye on, of course, not exacerbating the inflation problem?

711
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:09,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I defer to Molly as to guidance on ARPA relating to inflation.

712
01:03:09,463 --> 01:03:11,123
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I wanted to comment on

713
01:03:11,637 --> 01:03:24,100
[SPEAKER_02]: on the topic of inflation in general and or shortages, whether that's labor shortages or other shortages that are out there is we're definitely seeing an increase in bidding numbers that the city is putting out.

714
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's being seen by all communities.

715
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:29,761
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just something to mention while we're on the topic.

716
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:36,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I defer to Molly on guidance if there is any that she's come across as far as inflation and trying to address those issues.

717
01:03:37,503 --> 01:03:45,130
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no guidance on inflation within the final rule or through the Department of Treasury with ARPA.

718
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:58,362
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we do see a harm or an impact that has happened due to COVID, then direct aid to businesses or individuals, that is a program that can be developed.

719
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:09,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should ask the state to cap inflation at 2.5%, just like they cap our ability to address inflation at 2.5%.

720
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:13,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

721
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:15,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a few questions.

722
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:18,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again, Molly.

723
01:04:19,413 --> 01:04:24,856
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mentioned the $500 tax credit from the state level, that's different than the premium worker pay?

724
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:27,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Or that's the same thing?

725
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:36,148
[SPEAKER_11]: It's under the same umbrella, the state has a bucket of state fiscal recovery funds, and then each municipality has gotten a bucket.

726
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:46,653
[SPEAKER_11]: So the state has chosen to take 500 million of the state funds and distribute that to low income.

727
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,782
[SPEAKER_11]: to low-income individuals throughout Massachusetts.

728
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:56,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And those individuals receiving that, that wouldn't preclude them from receiving the premium pay.

729
01:04:56,205 --> 01:04:56,305
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

730
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:57,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure.

731
01:04:58,426 --> 01:05:01,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's the only.

732
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:04,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And the state earmarks, those are set by the legislature.

733
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Those earmarks, that wasn't something that, OK?

734
01:05:07,091 --> 01:05:07,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

735
01:05:07,851 --> 01:05:10,453
[SPEAKER_11]: One batch has been set by the legislature in Chapter 102.

736
01:05:12,101 --> 01:05:23,745
[SPEAKER_11]: The city is currently in the process of like working with the state to get those air, air, airlock funds in house, there will be a, the state is currently working on the next round.

737
01:05:24,506 --> 01:05:29,627
[SPEAKER_03]: So there will be future air marks, and where can people find out about what that money has been set for.

738
01:05:31,423 --> 01:05:32,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Great question.

739
01:05:32,404 --> 01:05:36,566
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that I have not published it anywhere, so I do not have an answer for that.

740
01:05:36,586 --> 01:05:37,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

741
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:38,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I did have one.

742
01:05:39,288 --> 01:05:41,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the website to submit feedback.

743
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:46,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already had residents email me some feedback as far as fund spending.

744
01:05:46,312 --> 01:05:48,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something we should just send to you if we're getting emails?

745
01:05:48,794 --> 01:05:49,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

746
01:05:49,034 --> 01:05:49,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

747
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:55,258
[SPEAKER_04]: A point of information on the earmarks, you could

748
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:57,330
[SPEAKER_04]: download the PDF.

749
01:05:57,590 --> 01:06:05,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's actually something on the state website on mass.gov that shows that your marks in the ARPA bill, and you can search by city.

750
01:06:06,413 --> 01:06:07,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you, Vice President Harris.

751
01:06:07,854 --> 01:06:08,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Sang.

752
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:21,718
[SPEAKER_05]: With regards to the earmarks, do we already, you know, is it already allocated by project, or is it just the general kind of fund that we can dip into, or is it something that, like, how does it work exactly with the state earmarks?

753
01:06:22,058 --> 01:06:23,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is by project.

754
01:06:24,957 --> 01:06:25,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool.

755
01:06:25,718 --> 01:06:31,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So has the city government been communicating with the state kind of reps to see how we're spending that?

756
01:06:32,703 --> 01:06:48,876
[SPEAKER_11]: That is, that is what is in the works with to get those, those earmarked funds in house, the town needs to communicate with the state, but like the plans for the project to be able to be eligible to receive that grant.

757
01:06:49,276 --> 01:06:50,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

758
01:06:50,898 --> 01:06:51,318
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may.

759
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:53,270
[SPEAKER_04]: just another point of information.

760
01:06:53,290 --> 01:07:05,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, just as the bill was, uh, under consideration, I was in communication with state representatives and Senator Jalen sending different ideas that I thought would be useful.

761
01:07:05,523 --> 01:07:10,789
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think as they consider another ARPA bill, and I'm sure that the mayor's office was similarly in communication, um,

762
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:24,029
[SPEAKER_04]: When they consider the other bill on the other $2 billion, I think it would be useful for all members of city government to communicate any interests or priorities to them.

763
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:26,031
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got some good stuff in there.

764
01:07:26,131 --> 01:07:27,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Duggar Park is getting a bunch of money.

765
01:07:28,673 --> 01:07:31,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Trees and stump replacement funding.

766
01:07:31,055 --> 01:07:40,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a set aside for us to, it's not enough to actually do the project, but some money set aside for the South Street and Main Street intersection reconstruction project.

767
01:07:40,543 --> 01:07:41,984
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple other ones that I don't remember.

768
01:07:44,445 --> 01:08:00,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for the discussion approval approval or receive a place on file second motion of Councilor Scarpelli to receive a file second by Vice President bears all those in favor.

769
01:08:01,074 --> 01:08:03,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose the motion passes.

770
01:08:03,395 --> 01:08:04,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

771
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:14,691
[SPEAKER_04]: to accept the committee report before we- Yes, sorry, motion to suspend the rules to take committee reports.

772
01:08:15,442 --> 01:08:18,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Vice President Barrett to suspend the rule to take the committee reports.

773

01:08:22,007 --> 01:08:22,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

776
01:08:22,447 --> 01:08:23,067
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed.

777
01:08:23,107 --> 01:08:23,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

778
01:08:23,868 --> 01:08:25,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Report to the committee 22-073, March 1st, 2022.

779
01:08:25,789 --> 01:08:28,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Committee of the whole report.

780
01:08:28,931 --> 01:08:34,355
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the meeting on the prior review commission due to some absences related to family medical issues.

781
01:08:35,095 --> 01:08:39,619
[SPEAKER_03]: We convene the meeting just to let everyone know that we'll be meeting at a later date to have the further discussion.

782
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:43,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now that meeting is set for Wednesday, March 16th at 5 p.m.

783
01:08:45,195 --> 01:08:46,175
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can, Madam President.

784
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Councilor Scarbelli.

785
01:08:48,236 --> 01:08:48,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

786
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:54,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that I unfortunately missed it, and I appreciate the understanding from my fellow counselors.

787
01:08:56,099 --> 01:09:05,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, my son was injured while at school in Maine, and I was on call to pick him up.

788
01:09:05,143 --> 01:09:06,403
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted him off campus.

789
01:09:06,983 --> 01:09:08,284
[SPEAKER_06]: He's fine, thank God.

790
01:09:08,324 --> 01:09:11,425
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no issues, but it was something that was unexpected.

791
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:13,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And again,

792
01:09:15,044 --> 01:09:31,532
[SPEAKER_06]: You love Netflix social media but we got beaten up pretty good about it but I appreciate your comments, Madam President, and just so everybody knows family does come first and this council's view in life so if I heard anybody's feelings.

793
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:36,702
[SPEAKER_06]: for the situation that I went through with my child.

794
01:09:37,302 --> 01:09:43,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I truly feel for those people that didn't understand the situation.

795
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:46,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and pretty disgusted in that.

796
01:09:46,086 --> 01:09:47,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much.

797
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:49,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for my colleagues for understanding.

798
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:49,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

799
01:09:53,570 --> 01:10:01,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Madam President, just if I may, I chaired that meeting and I tried to make it very clear to the public that these were urgent family and medical issues.

800
01:10:02,121 --> 01:10:03,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So any misinterpretation.

801
01:10:04,343 --> 01:10:05,104
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't your fault.

802
01:10:05,124 --> 01:10:07,247
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I appreciate it.

803
01:10:07,808 --> 01:10:10,431
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal was to keep everyone in the loop, not to put anyone on the spot.

804
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:11,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

805
01:10:13,185 --> 01:10:15,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a motion to approve?

806
01:10:15,546 --> 01:10:20,227
[SPEAKER_03]: A motion of vice-president Behrs to approve the committee report, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

807
01:10:20,247 --> 01:10:20,867
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

808
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:21,947
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

809
01:10:21,987 --> 01:10:22,867
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion passes.

810
01:10:22,887 --> 01:10:27,208
[SPEAKER_03]: 22-091, March 2nd, 2022, Committee of the Whole report.

811

812
01:10:31,509 --> 01:10:42,792
[SPEAKER_03]: This round, we went over a number of papers that people who petitioned, as well as Daniel Evans presented on these papers, we discussed each individually, and they are coming up next on the agenda.

813
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:49,038

01:16:16,107 --> 01:16:16,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Council.

885
01:16:16,908 --> 01:16:22,529
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling tonight in regards to the newly hired Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Director.

886
01:16:23,269 --> 01:16:24,970
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise I will not use any names.

887
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:35,713
[SPEAKER_00]: It was reported by several local news sites that this individual was just recently let go by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, where they held a very similar job

888
01:16:36,512 --> 01:16:37,473
[SPEAKER_00]: they do here in Medford.

889
01:16:37,633 --> 01:16:55,360
[SPEAKER_00]: According to these reports, allegedly the reason being was that they were fraudulently giving many people who work for the state vaccine exempt statuses during a major pandemic where vaccines are mandatory in order to work at the state and also here in Medford as an employee.

890
01:16:56,081 --> 01:16:59,922
[SPEAKER_00]: To me this seems a little extremely dangerous and very irresponsible.

891
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:00,863
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is,

892
01:17:01,828 --> 01:17:09,792
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen long time city employees let go, told to resign or suspended in order to mental health evaluations.

893
01:17:10,252 --> 01:17:15,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And was also noted in the paper that there were several other amazing applicants.

894
01:17:15,355 --> 01:17:17,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Why was this particular person hired?

895
01:17:17,696 --> 01:17:20,317
[SPEAKER_00]: And is this a concern of any of you?

896
01:17:20,697 --> 01:17:20,978

[SPEAKER_07]: This week, I find them in array.

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you Madam President to indulge me just for a quick moment.

915
01:18:23,378 --> 01:18:31,501
[SPEAKER_06]: A few weeks ago we had a horrible car accident on Harvard Street, and the young lady.

916
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:49,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Brooke Roselli was injured and is going to go through a very difficult time forward and I know that the community has really supported the Roselli family and helped in every way possible and I know that

917
01:18:50,091 --> 01:19:02,480
[SPEAKER_06]: very appreciative, but I know the community is putting together a night for Brooke to help with any of the facilities that might be needed as she comes home, hopefully soon.

918
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:12,827
[SPEAKER_06]: But on April 7th, they're doing an evening for Brooke from 5 to 10 at Premier on Broadway in the Somerville Method line.

919
01:19:12,847 --> 01:19:18,731

[SPEAKER_06]: Again, kudos to Meffitt police that they really went forward and hunted this culprit down enough that he came out of the woodwork and turned himself in.

922
01:19:41,189 --> 01:19:49,273
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but Brooke is a fighter and she's a survivor and she's gonna need our community's help.
