    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3.891s">10th</a>  regular meeting of the Medford City Council March 8 2022 is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=8.213s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=10.013s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=29.727s">the</a>  republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=43.211s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=47.003s">If</a>  the Councilors don't mind I can read this from the chair I'm actually the first resolution or. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=51.705s">Hey,</a>  you want to come up.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=54.186s">All</a>  right, I have no problem with the reading from the chair.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=59.168s">21-577</a>  offered by President Burrell be it resolved that the city of Medford through its city council raised the maximum income level for clause 41 a of MGL chapter 59 section <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=69.212s">the</a>  senior tax deferral to the amount established annually by the Commissioner of Revenue as to the income limit for single seniors who are not head of household to qualify under the senior circuit program. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=79.883s">As</a>  I mentioned last week, this is something we met with the whole about just the council has the power to set the maximum for seniors eligible for this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=90.828s">It's</a>  currently at $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=92.429s">The</a>  council has raised this a few times in recent years, and we met with the whole to discuss the idea of tying it to the senior <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=101.153s">circuit</a>  breaker amount which is about set by the Commissioner of Revenue goes up a small amount each year to stay with inflation and other metrics so that number is just over 61,000 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=111.922s">So</a>  this would tie that to this would tie our maximum to that number in perpetuity, unless we were to revisit as a council to adjust that amount so that is the resolution of any Councilors have any comments they would like to add.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=127.177s">This</a>  is a measure that we vetted properly, we've gone through a number of meetings on and it's something that I support a lot of leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=133.038s">What</a>  this does is it allows senior citizens the options to defer their taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=136.319s">If</a>  in fact they find themselves in a financial situation and they make the income hardship guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=141.0s">I</a>  think this is a policy that would make sense for those in our community especially based upon the housing shortages that we're seeing the economic circumstances that we're seeing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=149.769s">That</a>  in fact that we have a large population of senior citizens living in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=152.911s">I</a>  think this only makes sense to provide them with this type of relief and I support it will hardly move approval.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=157.494s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion on emotional Councilor Knight seconded by Vice President Bears Mr. Clerk, please actually know, we know we do need to call the role, because of this is a local option.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=186.04s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=190.844s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=192.906s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=194.908s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=196.51s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=211.483s">Councilor</a>  Knight, Madam President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=213.504s">This</a>  was on the agenda last week and I requested to be tabled for the opportunities of my council colleagues to also speak on it because they know James and Maureen very well, as do I, and if anybody played Medford pop Warner in the late 80s and early 1990s, they'd know Jimmy Heath as the man with the best mullet in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=231.417s">He</a>  and Maureen have been married now for 30 years and Maureen's been a active participant at the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=235.94s">Francis</a>  Mothers Club for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=238.382s">They've</a>  raised four beautiful children here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=240.873s">and</a>  they recently celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=243.775s">Many</a>  of us may know Jimmy from his time down at Pocanti Skating Rink, driving the Zamboni, or up at the Field of Dreams, working there as a ticket taker and a security guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=252.441s">And</a>  many of us know Maureen from all her involvement through youth sports, Metro Pop Warner in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=257.004s">So</a>  with that being said, Madam President, I'd ask that my council colleagues join me in congratulating two individuals that displayed the type of community that we here in Metro believe in, James and Maureen Heath, and the momentous occasion of their 30th anniversary.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=270.098s">Thank</a>  you for tonight to bring this forward I think that what a fitting couple to make sure that we acknowledge such a momentous occasion, and especially for Maureen, I think to be married to a gentleman like Jim for for 30 years that that's just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=288.064s">That's</a>  just, just an amazing feat and she should be commended and, and obviously I joke <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=297.031s">Jim's</a>  a great guy, and does a lot for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=300.432s">And</a>  this is, these are the type of people that make Medford the great city that we live in today. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=305.995s">Just</a>  great members, great neighbors, great community, great community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=310.817s">So</a>  congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=311.958s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=312.678s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Cabrera. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=313.538s">Councilor</a>  Cabrera.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=314.839s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=316.199s">Again,</a>  I just want to reiterate that my council, you know, Jimmy and Maureen Long, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=323.398s">volunteers</a>  in the community for the youth, youth sports for many years, especially mostly with the Pop Warner. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=333.127s">I've</a>  been privileged to go away with them on many of the cheerleading trips that we've gone on over the years and just want to wish them a congratulation on their 30th anniversary and hopefully they'll have 30 more.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=346.268s">on</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=349.19s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=350.851s">Opposed</a>  motion passes 22-089 offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved that the Metro City Council congratulate Kevin and Kathleen Finnegan on the momentous occasion of their 20th wedding anniversary tonight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=362.959s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=364.36s">Many</a>  of us know Kevin and Kathleen from Medford youth softball and Medford youth lacrosse Kevin was one of the inaugural coaches in the Medford youth lacrosse program back in the late 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=373.442s">Um,</a>  he rose up the ranks to become a past president actually, uh, just giving up the title just a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=378.685s">And,</a>  um, when you're looking for Kevin or Kathleen, you'll probably be able to find them at one of our fields, uh, at one of these practices, softball, lacrosse, uh, sometimes the hockey rink, even I imagine that, um, but they just celebrated the 20th anniversary of the two great people that have dedicated a lot of their time, energy, commitment to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=394.274s">Um,</a>  especially in the realm of, uh, youth sports and, and bringing our programs together as volunteers and boards of directors and coaches and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=401.612s">So</a>  with that being said, Madam President, I'd like to first recognize Kevin Finnegan, who was a senior when I was a freshman in high school, who was very good to me growing up, someone who I've been able to develop a friendship with over the years, and someone I've been able to work with on a number of these initiatives, especially the Medford Lacrosse Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=416.175s">He's</a>  someone that's really put his money where his mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=418.476s">He's</a>  someone that's always been there to show that his actions speak louder than his words. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=423.217s">A</a>  man of not much to say, but a lot to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=427.038s">And</a>  he's someone that I admire, and he's a friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=429.195s">And</a>  I certainly wish him and his wife a great anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=431.638s">20</a>  years is a great, great, great achievement that I congratulate them both. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=435.582s">So</a>  with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting them this evening in their celebration and also recognizing the work that they do in this community to make sure that Medford is a place where we can all thrive.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=447.997s">Again,</a>  thank you, Councilman for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=450.339s">I</a>  think between the Heath's and the Finnegan's, I think that there's a common bond here. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=457.622s">Two</a>  couples have been married 20 plus years and also members of our community that are great examples of what a backbone of family people are all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=469.549s">a</a>  good example of how to give back to the community and still maintain such a strong marriage and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=476.296s">So</a>  I congratulate them and wish them happy 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=480.22s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=481.041s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpello. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=481.901s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=484.224s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by... Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=487.64s">Vice</a>  President Bears, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=489.401s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=489.621s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=490.681s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=491.842s">Congratulations</a>  to the Peace and the Senegans. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=496.303s">22-090</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=497.944s">Be</a>  it resolved that the City Council reappoint City Messenger Lawrence Leopore for a term expiring on the first Monday of January 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=505.447s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=507.207s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=508.868s">I</a>  think there's something that we've, a little bit of housekeeping, I think we forgot to do when we all got inaugurated. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=514.812s">Larry's</a>  been here 28 years, and I think it's time we reappointed him for another couple more years, bring him up to 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=525.638s">Larry,</a>  are you going to accept the guest? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=532.762s">Larry's</a>  been here a long time, a lot longer than any of us have been here, and well-deserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=536.684s">He</a>  does a good job every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=539.085s">Everyone</a>  stays to our house or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=540.926s">So</a>  motion to reappoint Larry. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=544.467s">Madam</a>  President, if I could also amend this, sort of falls under our thing, but if you and the clerk <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=554.192s">yourself</a>  and the clerk could sit down with the mayor and talk about maybe an increase in pay for the young man who does our TV things every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=565.001s">He's</a>  working two to three nights a week here and well underpaid for what he does. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=570.326s">So</a>  under your guidance and between you and the clerk, you talk to the mayor about seeing about increasing his pay would be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=580.875s">As</a>  a big paper.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=585.758s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=586.778s">Thank</a>  you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=587.919s">Thanks,</a>  Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=589.801s">This</a>  is something that shouldn't have gone unnoticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=593.223s">But</a>  when you have someone like Larry, he's been the the common denominator for politics in this hallowed hall, and we appreciate everything he does. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=605.452s">I</a>  know that I know he had a long street going. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=609.435s">before</a>  that ice storm left a few Fridays ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=611.996s">I</a>  was pretty disappointed that he didn't make the trek out in two inches of ice and had to deliver on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=619.137s">If</a>  I could just ask if he could maybe bring a treat for now on so Gabby doesn't rip the couch apart when he drops off our papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=627.359s">But</a>  again, I second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=629.519s">Thank</a>  you, Larry and move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=633.932s">Council</a>  Scarpelli, would that be something that he could put in his expense report that you know what, forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=639.718s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=640.198s">I</a>  just, you know, as a new Councilor I wanted to.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=651.072s">talk</a>  about how much Larry means to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=652.913s">I</a>  mean, Larry's been super helpful with my deliveries, especially given my kind of wacky schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=659.557s">He's</a>  been able to work around that and I'm very, very thankful for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=663.679s">And</a>  I'm also super thankful that he's been such a welcoming person in the city council chambers since the first day that I got to my seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=674.705s">So</a>  I'm very excited about this motion.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=680.727s">Thank</a>  you very much, Larry, congratulations and thank you for all you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=684.249s">When</a>  you sit down and you think about 20 years of service, and then you look behind this rail and you look at this body combined we have 31 years behind this real combined 31 years of service Larry has 28 by himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=696.637s">The</a>  institutional knowledge that this man possesses is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=699.119s">He's</a>  seen it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=700.219s">He's</a>  been at every single city council meeting for 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=705.03s">I</a>  would have found you not guilty, Larry. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=706.592s">I</a>  would have gave you parole a long time ago, literally. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=711.56s">But</a>  the institutional knowledge that you possess and the friendship that you've shown me over the years has been something that's tremendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=719.151s">Larry's</a>  a man of few words. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=720.873s">But</a>  if you ask him a question, he'll certainly give you an answer and he's been here and seen it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=724.476s">He's</a>  a great resource to all of us and he's something that we need, especially when you see the transition through City Hall and the department heads and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=730.88s">You</a>  know, we need someone that has an institutional knowledge that can guide us in the right direction, point us in the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=735.223s">And</a>  Larry's that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=736.464s">You</a>  know, the City Messenger's job is to deliver the papers and to make sure that we're <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=742.009s">informed</a>  with the provided with the materials that are necessary for us to prepare for the meeting but Larry does much more than that, and his title messenger does not necessarily reflect all that he does for this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=753.322s">So</a>  Larry thank you very much I support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=755.565s">We've</a>  been a great friend for a long time and I wouldn't want anybody else sitting in that chair for you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=761.923s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, and my comments, very similar to Councilor Knights, which are just that if you have a question about what's happened in this city and you wanna compare something that's happening now to something that's happened basically the entire time we've had this charter, Larry's the person to talk to, and I'm grateful to have a lot of great conversations after our meetings with Larry. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=781.737s">So</a>  I'm very supportive of this motion.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=931.433s">All</a>  the duties incumbent upon me as Medford City Messenger according to the best of my ability and understanding agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=944.747s">The</a>  laws of this Commonwealth <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=960.234s">Thank</a>  you, Eric.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=995.874s">All</a>  right, you ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=999.155s">22-092,</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1001.235s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the administration start providing information to our residents on where they're able to get assistance with their heat and energy costs, not just fuel oil assistance, but assistance with both gas and electric heat related costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1013.458s">Be</a>  it further resolved that we obtain a report on the cost of the aggregate electric contract compared to national grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1019.379s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1019.939s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1021.72s">Anybody</a>  that, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1023.357s">owns</a>  a home or has to pay for the heat in the house, I think has seen a giant increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1029.46s">And</a>  I know in the past, we've had some assistance with fuel oil, but I don't know if anybody has gotten the gas bill lately, gas bill is through the roof, electric bill is through the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1042.747s">I</a>  don't know, I know in the past we've had some programs there for fuel assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1047.69s">It</a>  didn't include gas and electric heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1051.612s">Again,</a>  maybe Alicia Hunt, she's the Energy and Environment Director, maybe she can provide us with a report if there are any funds available for the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1063.72s">I</a>  don't know if that's covered under, maybe some of that's covered under the APA agreement, but like I say, anybody that owns a house or apartment that pays rent and pays a giant increase no matter what your heat yield is. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1076.929s">Any</a>  help to the residents can be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1080.203s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Favella. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1081.067s">Any</a>  further, Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1084.03s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1084.27s">And</a>  I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1087.612s">I</a>  was interested in this resolution because, you know, over the course of particularly in the past couple of years with the pandemic, from my work in the community, I've heard about different sorts of energy and fuel assistance programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1097.577s">So</a>  I went on the city website to see, you know, what's current, what's available, what's easy to find, and it's not easy to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1104.34s">So</a>  if those fuel assistance programs are available, we should make it really easy for people to find them because as you note, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1110.899s">more</a>  and more people are in greater and greater need of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1113.461s">We</a>  should make it easy, we should make it navigable, make it visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1116.403s">So</a>  I'm really interested to hear that update from the administration, not just on what's available, but also on some of the programs that were really broadcasted during the peak of COVID, what's still relevant, and if not, what's taken that place. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1128.21s">So</a>  looking forward to getting this update from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1130.672s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1131.993s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1132.973s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1135.635s">And</a>  just from the chair, I do know there is at least the state program LIHEAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1140.258s">My</a>  father worked in that area for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1142.199s">That</a>  is one program, L-I-H-E-A-P. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1144.941s">But</a>  of course, as Councilor Cohn said, as you said, these are things the president should be able to find in one easy space. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1149.784s">And</a>  especially if there are additional programs beyond the state level programs.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1153.306s">Madam</a>  President, again, the other part is, we have that agreement with Good Energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1161.068s">And</a>  I'd like to know where we are with how those costs have gone compared to what national grid is. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1166.854s">Because</a>  I know there are people that have been getting calls from other companies that are cheaper than what we're paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1172.819s">So</a>  I'd like to know where we stand with that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1174.821s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1175.842s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1178.303s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1181.746s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1183.287s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1184.548s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1186.33s">22-093</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1188.911s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Sylvia Bolden on her passing at 99 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1196.297s">Mrs.</a>  Bolden was a 98 year resident of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1198.719s">Her</a>  presence in our community will be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1200.64s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1685.027s">have</a>  been paying attention to the recent ongoings and current events here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1689.172s">Just</a>  recently, one of our state troopers from the Wellington Barracks was critically injured in a motor vehicle accident on Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1697.945s">Her</a>  services are actually being held this evening up at, I believe, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1701.668s">Anthony's</a>  Church in Urbana. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1703.549s">But</a>  Trupa Bucci was a 34-year-old state trooper who was relatively new on the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1709.613s">She</a>  had a career prior life working over at Encore Casino as a security specialist over there with a number of Metro residents that I know very well, including Arthur Simmons and Jason Wong, for example, who called me to express their concern over the circumstances surrounding this terrible accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1725.963s">My</a>  life was taken well too short due to a preventable motor vehicle accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1730.867s">I</a>  think it's all too common that we see the way that people drive on the roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1735.43s">The</a>  condition of our roads, the circumstances that led to this event show that a lot of it has to do less with driver training and less with driver responsibility than it does with actual design. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1746.859s">And</a>  we sat here last week, we talked about Vision Zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1750.107s">We</a>  talked about using design to make our roads safer because sometimes there's just nothing we can do to prevent an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1756.534s">And</a>  when you hear about the circumstances surrounding this incident, I think it's safe to say that the truck driver was not necessarily at fault, and this was an accident that just occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1765.163s">It</a>  was really something that was almost preventable, unpreventable. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1769.247s">But</a>  to lose a trooper at age 34 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1772.61s">with</a>  so much potential and so much life ahead of her. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1776.333s">It's</a>  something that's very sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1777.714s">She</a>  suited up every day to make sure that this community was safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1780.196s">She</a>  was stationed right here in our city, and she responded to the calls that we all make. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1784.379s">And</a>  I think it's very important for us to recognize the sacrifices that she's made sacrifices that her family made through her service. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1791.824s">So</a>  with that being said, I asked my council colleagues for this resolution, and I'm sending <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1796.87s">family</a>  of tomorrow G, not only her personal family but also extended family at the Masters of State barrack state his back to.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1871.37s">Now</a>  Madam President, thank you very much and I do believe the councilor Scarpelli is a co sponsor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1877.211s">Just</a>  recently, Mr. Boyd passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1880.372s">someone</a>  who lived in the city of Medford for, geez, got to be 70 years, was a military veteran and just an all-around good person. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1887.875s">His</a>  son, Buzzer, and I are very close friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1889.916s">His</a>  son, Billy, was just elected not too long ago to the New Hampshire State Legislature, and the city council had honored him on this achievement as a high school graduate, getting elected to the New Hampshire State Legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1901.981s">So</a>  as you can tell, he's a proud father who raised a good family of public servants. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1906.765s">He</a>  was, as I said, was a veteran, as was his son, Bowser, after him. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1910.766s">And</a>  recently he passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1912.526s">He</a>  will be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1913.727s">Mr.</a>  Boyd was quite a character. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1916.568s">I</a>  fondly remember a conversation that I had with him when the tree in front of his house was removed and he called and wanted the tree replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1923.789s">So</a>  I reached out to forestry department and I asked that they replace a tree in front of the Boyd's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1930.671s">And</a>  they went down and they replaced the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1933.232s">And</a>  Mr. Boyd called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1934.945s">And</a>  he said, what the hell is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1936.486s">And</a>  if you saw what this was, it was Charlie Brown's Christmas tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1940.548s">It</a>  was the funniest looking little tree I'd ever see. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1942.589s">It</a>  was maybe eight inches tall and didn't have a leave on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1946.431s">And</a>  me and Mr. Boyd just laughed and laughed and laughed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1948.852s">It</a>  was one of the funniest things that this happened to me in government service. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1953.094s">You</a>  know, when you call and you ask them to plant a tree and the gentleman says, the trees come in and we're all excited about the tree coming and then <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1958.537s">There</a>  it is, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1959.558s">It's</a>  a little twig sticking out of the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1962.099s">He</a>  didn't know whether it was supposed to water it or pull it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1964.701s">It</a>  was just, it was a really funny circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1967.443s">And</a>  he and I laughed about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1968.604s">And</a>  his son and I laughed about it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1970.665s">But</a>  just a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1971.686s">I</a>  take it from us, well, far too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1974.107s">Many</a>  of us that live in the Salem Street area would see him driving around in his beautiful Corvette. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1978.868s">And</a>  that's when we know that Mr. Boyd was out and about. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1982.009s">But</a>  with that being said, I'd just like to ask my council colleagues to extend a note of condolence to the family for a United States military veteran who's served our country and served this community so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1992.434s">He's</a>  raised two civic-minded children in Buzzard Valley. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1996.256s">One's</a>  a state rep, the other one's a veterans advocate up at Post 45, and they've both done great things for this community as well as their father. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2003.519s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2006.441s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2010.082s">A</a>  sad day, Mr. Boyd was a true hero, a veteran, someone who loved Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2020.904s">Mr.</a>  and Mrs. Boyd had two children and they raised them to love the city of Medford and love their country. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2028.845s">And</a>  that's one thing, if you know Buzzer and you know Billy, that's what they're all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2033.566s">Billy</a>  and I were classmates at Medford High School in class of 87 and nobody could, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2039.128s">Nobody</a>  could. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2040.815s">Nobody</a>  could tell Billy he could bring his trumpet to any event and play the fight song. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2046.336s">And</a>  that's something that Mr. Boyd instilled in his children. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2050.517s">And</a>  he'll be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2052.857s">I</a>  know that he's gone through a tough time the last couple of years, but he was definitely a fighter and appreciate everything he's done for our community and our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2065.019s">And</a>  we send our condolences to the Boyd brothers. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2070.72s">wish</a>  them well, it's difficult times.</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2208.1s">So</a>  today I will be presenting on Medford's American Rescue Plan Act today, also known as ARPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2214.965s">I</a>  am here to answer any questions at the end of this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2220.169s">Firstly,</a>  I will be defining what ARPA is, the spirit behind it, eligibility and ineligible uses, and framing project narratives. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2229.576s">I</a>  will then share the community engagement plan for the next year, which is a defining piece of the strategic spending plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2239.845s">ARPA</a>  is a COVID relief bill, a bill to help remedy the harm from the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2247.927s">The</a>  spirit of ARPA is to help fight the pandemic and support municipalities, individuals, families and businesses struggling with the pandemic, with the public health and negative economic impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2260.01s">Maintain</a>  vital public services among decline in revenue and build a strong, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2266.15s">resilient</a>  and equitable recovery by making investments that support long-term growth and opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2274.496s">The</a>  federal government released 1.9 trillion in funds to stimulate the economy back in March of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2280.56s">These</a>  funds are making their way to individuals, families, municipalities, and businesses in a number of avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2286.664s">For</a>  example, Medford has been earmarked <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2290.076s">to</a>  receive 1.2 million for state ARPA-funded projects in addition to direct federal funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2300.622s">Today,</a>  we'll be focusing on coronavirus local fiscal recovery dollars, or $48 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2306.625s">ARPA</a>  was signed into law in March of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2313.069s">The</a>  first set of guidance was released in May 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2315.991s">The</a>  final rule was issued this past January in 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2320.451s">Just</a>  last week, the Department of the Treasury released updates on compliance and program guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2326.053s">The</a>  final rule is 500 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2328.513s">Cities</a>  and administrators are tasked with building programs as changing guidance emerges and additional allocations received. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2336.256s">Medford</a>  is taking careful and thorough approach when creating plans for funds as to avoid duplication of efforts and funding sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2344.498s">For</a>  example, the state of Massachusetts still has $2 billion in state relief funds to allocate to cities and towns this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2355.584s">2026</a>  is the spending deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2357.665s">This</a>  creates a fiscal cliff for any social programs, staffing, projects funded by ARPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2363.608s">The</a>  deadline also means that when budgeting, projecting up to 2026 is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2369.752s">We</a>  are mindful that these funds have an expiration date. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2374.917s">There</a>  are four very broad categories in ARPA, responding to the public health emergency being the largest. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2383.701s">This</a>  is a non-exhausted list of prohibited uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2387.162s">Funds</a>  cannot be used to offset a tax cut, pensions, loans, settlements, cash reserves, or stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2397.026s">This</a>  section will go over a non-exhausted list of eligible uses broken out into, in the four sections of the final rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2407.523s">This</a>  first section shows outlined programs as described by the Treasury to remedy the harm caused to impacted populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2415.546s">This</a>  includes public health, support staff, direct aid to the business community, impacted business community, and direct aid to individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2428.73s">This</a>  second section shows outlined programs as described by the Department of Treasury to remedy disproportionately impacted populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2436.531s">This</a>  includes educational disparities like learning loss, investments in neighborhoods, community health, and long-term financial security programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2451.354s">This</a>  slide shows compliance isn't necessarily about the program idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2455.475s">It</a>  is first and foremost about identifying the public health or economic impact caused or exacerbated by the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2462.718s">Then</a>  after identifying the harm, identifying the individual, population, or business as an impacted group or disproportionately impacted group, then using a program from the Treasury's guidance to remedy that harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2475.81s">Knowing</a>  whether a group is impacted or disproportionately impacted either narrows or expands the programs available. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2489.994s">This</a>  second section is revenue replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2492.095s">Revenue</a>  replacement is based on a formula provided by the treasury to estimate how much the tax base shrunk during the public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2501.038s">These</a>  funds can be used for anything categorized as a government service, like administration, education, and public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2510.681s">Premium</a>  pay is the third section. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2512.521s">Premium</a>  pay, also known as low-income essential worker pay, these funds are <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2517.919s">designated</a>  as an economic remedy for people who do not earn a living wage, a population who were specifically harmed by the public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2529.828s">Fortunately,</a>  the state is using 500 million of its ARPA funds to fund low income essential employee pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2537.094s">This</a>  takes away the administrative burden on municipalities and is best fit <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2541.915s">which</a>  is best fit for the state to handle because cities and towns do not have access to tax data needed to identify these individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2549.7s">I</a>  would like to take this opportunity to announce that the state is issuing $500 checks starting this March. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2558.525s">For</a>  example, an individual making $38,000 will receive a check and a family of four making $78,000 or less will be receiving a check. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2570.792s">To</a>  learn more, please follow the link on the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2572.733s">And</a>  slides will be posted on medford.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2580.756s">The</a>  fourth and final section is infrastructure, particularly water, sewer, and broadband. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2585.158s">The</a>  federal government believes that communities having access to clean water and information are essential to healthy communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2593.061s">Funds</a>  can be used for construction, subsidies, grants, and classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2600.772s">Community</a>  engagement is an important component to the information gathering step for the strategic ARPA implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2608.055s">The</a>  purpose is to develop base knowledge for all stakeholders, try to engage all populations, explore community priorities, and share data with all stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2617.019s">Activities</a>  will focus on sharing where emergency spending is going and creating accessible activities for residents to share their values. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2627.564s">effort</a>  to bring equity to this process, Medford will focus on creating community relationships as to reach as many Medford residents as possible, offer translated materials, de-technicalized language, and share information through a number of sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2641.17s">Types</a>  of communication that will be used on the website will be <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2649.435s">The</a>  Medford government website Medford community media city hall department email list newsletters public spaces, the phone social media and in person interactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2660.29s">Specific</a>  activities for community engagement include community survey community meetings and an outreach series. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2669.898s">Medford</a>  plans on releasing a multilingual survey this spring, conduct an outreach series over the summer, close the survey in the fall, and have analysis out in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2679.649s">The</a>  project selection process starting in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2688.339s">What</a>  has been spent and how will funding be allocated? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2692.42s">Currently</a>  COVID testing, specifically rapid tests are available to vulnerable populations distributed at West Medford Community Center, the Senior Center and Medford Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2704.667s">COVID</a>  mitigation, like computers for work from home and COVID safe water filling stations for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2710.911s">Next,</a>  funding has been spent on community outreach workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2716.835s">Also</a>  on wastewater construction at James, Swamp, Goldsmith and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2722.328s">And</a>  finally, the lead rebate program. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2727.151s">Four</a>  elements are crucial when planning spending objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2734.835s">One,</a>  public feedback and values. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2737.016s">Two,</a>  emergency needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2738.657s">Three,</a>  project readiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2740.538s">And</a>  four, understanding previous priorities identified in earlier processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2746.589s">For</a>  example, priorities identified in the Capital Improvement Report, Medford Comprehensive Plan, and the Medford Climate Report. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2754.072s">All</a>  of these and more can be found at medford.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2759.954s">This</a>  is a visualization on how feedback from the public will be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2764.716s">So</a>  feedback mixed with emergency needs, department priorities, and previous plans will all be mixed together. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2770.818s">Then</a>  we'll check for project readiness and <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2775.404s">it's</a>  ready, then that will be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2783.671s">Finally,</a>  updates and ways to get involved can be found at medford.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2790.625s">In</a>  conclusion, here are some projects that have been shared by local and similar cities to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2797.069s">The</a>  money has not started flowing yet for many of these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2800.911s">Setting</a>  up these programs are taking municipalities a lot of time as we figure out capacity issues, operational procedures, and learn updated treasury guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2810.517s">These</a>  projects exemplify a mix between direct aid, government service improvements, and business supports. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2819.411s">I</a>  will stop sharing my screen now, but I am available for questions.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2827.497s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2828.678s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2830.199s">A</a>  couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2831.24s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2831.881s">So</a>  I saw something about pay to go projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2837.345s">What</a>  would be considered a pay to go project?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2839.666s">Pay</a>  to go project. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2841.188s">That</a>  means that a loan has not been taken out to fund that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2845.791s">So</a>  it's a project that we are <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2849.08s">literally</a>  paying for it as it's being- Can you give me an example of something that you would be considering? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2854.384s">Construction.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2856.085s">Construction</a>  of?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2856.986s">So</a>  currently there is a wastewater project that is happening at Swamp, Goldsmith and Main, and that is a pay go project.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2865.573s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2867.194s">And</a>  the essential workers under the premium pay program, how are we going to identify <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2875.716s">those</a>  workers, I mean, do you have to live in Medford or just work in Medford?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2880.018s">We</a>  are still looking over the guidance on essential employee pay, essential worker pay.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2887.6s">Now,</a>  does that cover private business employees also? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2892.802s">Private</a>  business, I mean, you know, like if you work the stop and shop, you know, is that considered?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2898.664s">It</a>  does include private sector.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2901.008s">And</a>  do those people that work in the private sector have to live in Medford to get that funding?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2908.053s">So</a>  if it's Medford funding, yes.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2910.734s">If</a>  it's a Medford company, but what if they don't live in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2913.916s">Are</a>  they eligible? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2914.637s">Oh,</a>  I still need to- Are they eligible for the funds or is it just regulated to people that work in Medford businesses that live in Medford?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2922.922s">I</a>  will definitely consult with our consultants on that and check out the guidance.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2926.865s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2931.227s">Thanks</a>  for the presentation, Molly. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2934.588s">You</a>  know, we did, I just wanted to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2937.829s">And</a>  I don't know if this is similar to the presentation you might be giving tomorrow, but we spent 8.6 million of the ARPA money on revenue recovery in fiscal 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2948.133s">And</a>  I was just wondering if <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2950.277s">I</a>  just didn't see it in the list of things that we had spent money on. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2953.198s">And</a>  so is that a non-exhaustive list of things that money had been spent on, or is it just that that one piece, that revenue recovery piece wasn't included in the list?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2962.762s">Yeah,</a>  I think that's a relatively fair statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2965.243s">It's</a>  just a non-exhaustive list because the revenue replacement aspect just wasn't the same scale as the other items that were being presented, but certainly the 8.6.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2973.967s">Yeah,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2974.467s">I</a>  just, you know, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2977.648s">I</a>  think people are going to be surprised when they see, looking at the revenue replacement formula from the final rule, just how much revenue we lost and just how much of the 48 million is probably going to end up in a revenue replacement fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2989.932s">And</a>  I think that that might be a good thing to let people know, you know, we see 48 million people think all our problems are solved. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2995.554s">If</a>  we end up spending 32 of a million of that on revenue replacement, then the pool for the PAYGO programs is much smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3001.797s">So</a>  that's just my one piece of feedback, but thank you for the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3007.593s">Thank</a>  you, Council President and thank you for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3010.596s">Now,</a>  the question I have is, I work in municipality, and I work as the acting director of recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3018.426s">And</a>  one thing we're seeing is we're seeing a huge gap with parents going back to work and being home that had young children that had coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3028.494s">Now</a>  that moving out and you have both parents with two family house that children left without assistance after school and something that we're working on in my community that I'm working in, but something that <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3042.365s">I</a>  know that the Director of Recreation, Kevin, is working right now with one of the phone calls, a bunch of phone calls we've received about the same issue, which is the voucher, the families that have voucher programs are being accepted into afterschool programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3059.497s">And</a>  then you have the families that have funding to pay the expensive fees for an afterschool program. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3066.742s">And</a>  what's left now is a huge gap <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3069.904s">of</a>  families that really never needed after school care. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3074.888s">And</a>  we're seeing a huge disparity now. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3077.39s">And</a>  I'll be working closely with with the director and working with him and sharing some of our ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3084.476s">I</a>  know that in in my community where I'm working, we're actually <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3090.224s">taking</a>  over an afterschool program for low-income middle school boys and girls, and we're hoping to use the ARPA money to assist us with those gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3103.074s">So</a>  the question I have, would that be something that the parents and the director could come to the body and ask for assistance? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3112.081s">Does</a>  that fall into the category here in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3113.802s">Is</a>  that something that we're looking at as you see these concerns that we're seeing and these gaps now?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3120.258s">It</a>  seems like that that is like you identified a harm that that was caused by the pandemic so I would say, definitely something to bring.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3127.969s">Okay,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3129.251s">That's</a>  great to you so it's going to be this I appreciate the presentation because you really shared a lot here and it's something that I think as we move on to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3137.902s">It's</a>  something they can they can use in different departments can use to assist to fill in those gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3142.845s">And</a>  I know I'll be bothering the chief of staff in the mayor's office and asking to assist in any way I can to help with that gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3150.55s">So</a>  I appreciate all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3152.591s">And</a>  I think this is I know that Council B has brought up a very, very good point where it's the hidden, you know, everybody thinks that we're getting every penny is going to go to everything we need is going to fix everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3163.157s">But</a>  we should really understand where that money's coming from where it's already earmarked. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3167.24s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3167.84s">But</a>  thank you again for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3169.461s">This</a>  is great.</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3170.821s">I</a>  will just mention as a caveat with any of these programs, there will be, we need to set like income eligibility requirements and there is data that needs to be reported to the Department of Treasury to keep it all compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3185.408s">So</a>  it isn't always straightforward, but that is definitely like a harm or an impact that can be remedied through these funds.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3193.072s">And</a>  I'm sure that's easy to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3194.212s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3200.223s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3200.563s">And</a>  thank you, Molly, for that very thorough presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3202.885s">I'm</a>  excited to hear that the slides will be available online because there's a lot to plumb through and I'm sure I'll be revisiting it to get caught up on all the nuts and bolts. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3211.553s">You</a>  answered a lot of the questions that I had in terms of what specific programs are and aren't eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3217.938s">One</a>  of the things that's on my mind, which I'm sure is one of the many things that isn't yet set in stone is <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3223.523s">kind</a>  of a more specific timeline for the community engagement piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3226.867s">Some</a>  of the questions that I've been hearing from residents are, you know, it's so great that this is going to be a participatory process, but what is it going to look like and how will I know that my feedback is being, you know, really incorporated, not just received and then <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3240.041s">put</a>  in a filing cabinet somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3242.484s">So</a>  I'm sure the timeline for making those decisions is still being finessed, but do you have any sort of preliminary thoughts about, you know, if there's lots of ideas that are compelling and meet the requirements and perhaps are mentioned in a previous program like the social justice roadmap or the Medford comprehensive plan, what the <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3264.104s">what</a>  the decision process will be like for prioritizing among many good ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3271.186s">And</a>  if that's not a today question, that's also fine.</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3275.167s">The</a>  timeline for community input will be the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3278.148s">Then</a>  there'll be a community outreach series in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3284.53s">That</a>  data will then be collected, analyzed, and released in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3291.113s">As</a>  that, as we move through this year, the administration will be looking at what like what's what's needed emergency wise and those projects and that funding will be what will be public facing and announced.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3310.26s">I</a>  had quite similar questions to my colleagues on that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3316.086s">You</a>  mentioned that it would be released, will it be posted on the city website, on the ARPA website, perhaps?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3323.252s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3323.873s">Okay,</a>  awesome.</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3325.314s">Currently,</a>  we have, the slides will be up this week, and there is a community engagement timeline, and there's some background information on ARPA.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3336.643s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3337.504s">Well,</a>  you mentioned the administration will go through and see what's an emergency, what's not, what projects are ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3346.113s">Will</a>  the administration perhaps be open to <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3351.132s">explaining</a>  a little bit when the time comes, like why certain projects are chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3355.655s">I</a>  think that it goes to kind of Councilor Collins's point where like some residents might feel, you know, this project seems ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3365.021s">Why</a>  wasn't it chosen? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3367.743s">Would</a>  the administration have the capacity to kind of explain to citizens on the website?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3374.167s">That's</a>  definitely a fantastic question. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3376.709s">I</a>  mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3377.585s">I'm</a>  trying to think through how that might unfold and trying to think through scenarios, you know, you know, obviously from a time standpoint, you know, Q amp a might be able to be developed on. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3392.137s">circumstances</a>  that's more generic, but I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I'm not prepared to commit because frankly, I'm still learning about all the different avenues and aspects and types of requests that might come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3405.303s">It</a>  would be easy to say, well, this item was not eligible and therefore it could not be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3410.205s">It</a>  would be relatively easy to develop a Q and A going through, depending upon the volume we received, depending upon, you know, the number of inquiries we received, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3421.89s">you</a>  know, it's just it may be difficult, maybe burdensome for an already strapped process. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3427.213s">But,</a>  you know, I think it's really great input. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3429.254s">It's</a>  something we should look at that just I'm not prepared to answer the question because we're in uncharted territory, to be honest.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3435.335s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3436.236s">Um,</a>  and I guess my last point was, um, you talked a lot about, you know, like a community engagement and also a lot about, um, looking at what other communities are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3445.801s">Have</a>  we kind of looked at what other communities are doing and how other communities in the past have done with regards to like participatory budgeting when it comes to engaging the community in the process, perhaps? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3456.888s">I</a>  know you had a list of like a <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3459.469s">probably</a>  the most specific list I've seen so far about community outreach that our city will do. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3466.715s">But,</a>  you know, have you guys been looking at what other communities have been doing, what other kind of communities in the past have been doing in processes like this?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3476.023s">I'm</a>  just going to clarify, just make sure that I heard you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3480.087s">What</a>  you're wondering is if we have researched what other local communities have done to receive community feedback.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3486.936s">Yes,</a>  focused on local communities, but also open to other communities going through similar processes.</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3493.001s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3494.142s">That</a>  is how the community survey was developed, how the outreach series was developed, and also this meeting and future community meetings.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3507.79s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3508.651s">I'm</a>  very excited to see your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3511.093s">Very</a>  excited to see, you know, the fruits of your labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3514.957s">And</a>  I have confidence in this process going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3518.281s">So</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3521.793s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, three more things came up in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3526.314s">But</a>  not to just keep being a broken record on the revenue replacement piece, but is the thought that that will be estimated out through December 2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3539.437s">Like</a>  how much revenue we expect to replace in each fiscal year just because I think again, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3544.493s">The</a>  last thing we want to do is commit to fund a project, but then come back and say, either we can't fund that project, because we need to use this for revenue replacement, or say, we have a $500,001 million deficit on the budget, I mean because that 8.6 million was incredibly important to preventing teacher layoffs and staff layoffs and program cuts so <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3565.68s">is</a>  the thought that you'd say, so for fiscal 23, we'll need this much, fiscal 24, we'll need this much, fiscal 25, we'll need this much, fiscal 26, and then subtract that out and say, so that's the chunk that we're gonna need using this formula, and that leaves this chunk that we can use for other projects, or just what's the approach gonna be?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3584.329s">I</a>  think that's a great question, especially because it's one that's been on all of our minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3589.732s">It's</a>  been one that we've been looking at, talking about revenue replacement has been <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3594.17s">a</a>  big part of the discussions we've been having. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3596.051s">I</a>  think it's all about looking at some of the trends that have occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3602.014s">And</a>  the trends that we were seeing at the early stage of the pandemic may be very different than the trends we're seeing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3608.978s">And</a>  so analyzing them as they go, and as we learn more information is a critical piece to this puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3615.182s">We're</a>  presently in the initial stages of starting the budgetary process, which means we're also beginning the process to estimate revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3622.177s">be</a>  better informed about that once we do the revenue estimations for fiscal 23 and then perhaps that process plus further guidance from the state and other guidance on trends that you know communities are seeing as far as revenue impacts will be better you know in terms of helping us glean what the future holds for revenue replacement in the out years</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3645.763s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3646.083s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3646.364s">And</a>  I just, you know, I think we're all hopeful that it goes, you know, 8.65210. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3652.129s">But</a>  if it goes 8.6, 8.6, 8.6, 8.6 for five years, that's all the money, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3658.295s">So</a>  that's just something that's on my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3661.498s">Second</a>  piece, and this is, I know this is a presentation on ARPA, but you are the federal funds manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3667.924s">Do</a>  you have any inkling <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3669.954s">of</a>  when like infrastructure bill funding may be headed our way, or is that in the next three months or six months or 12 months? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3680.423s">And</a>  obviously you've been hard at work on ARPA, so if it's just hasn't, you haven't gotten there yet, I understand that.</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3686.227s">I</a>  have not gotten to read the infrastructure bill yet.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3688.529s">Okay,</a>  gotcha. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3691.612s">And</a>  then last thing, it's a very specific comment, but again, if you're gonna use this presentation going forward and post it on the website, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3700.103s">At</a>  least I personally, and I think other people may have a visceral reaction to the funnel diagram. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3707.349s">Just</a>  from a total design standpoint, maybe look at like circles with plus signs between them instead of the funnel, because I think people might see the funnel as a wastebasket. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3716.556s">It's</a>  just totally random thought, but it just came to my head immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3720.52s">I</a>  understood what your intent was, but I think other people, for whatever reason, may see it differently.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3728.026s">Thank</a>  you for that feedback.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3729.267s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3730.405s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor Riveras.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3732.189s">Um,</a>  this is a question that popped in my into my mind while concert bears talking because I'm, I think it's tied to this idea of economics at a greater level, but I'm obviously inflation is something that's on everyone's mind right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3746.712s">There's,</a>  you know, inflation is the best job we can't we can't do anything but we can you know economists have said that perhaps or there are ways that we could really alleviate some inflationary pressures. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3758.435s">This</a>  is city have a sense of what areas are <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3762.556s">workable</a>  in terms of what we can do about relieving some of those inflationary pressures with regards to funds like these? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3774.679s">Or</a>  would the city be able to study this going forward with an eye on, of course, not exacerbating the inflation problem?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3783.821s">I</a>  defer to Molly as to guidance on ARPA relating to inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3789.463s">One</a>  thing I wanted to comment on <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3791.637s">on</a>  the topic of inflation in general and or shortages, whether that's labor shortages or other shortages that are out there is we're definitely seeing an increase in bidding numbers that the city is putting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3804.14s">And</a>  that's being seen by all communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3806.18s">So</a>  it's just something to mention while we're on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3809.821s">And</a>  then I defer to Molly on guidance if there is any that she's come across as far as inflation and trying to address those issues.</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3817.503s">There</a>  is no guidance on inflation within the final rule or through the Department of Treasury with ARPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3825.61s">But</a>  if we do see a harm or an impact that has happened due to COVID, then direct aid to businesses or individuals, that is a program that can be developed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3842.103s">I</a>  think we should ask the state to cap inflation at 2.5%, just like they cap our ability to address inflation at 2.5%.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3852.249s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3853.67s">I</a>  just have a few questions.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3856.231s">Thank</a>  you again, Molly. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3859.413s">So</a>  you mentioned the $500 tax credit from the state level, that's different than the premium worker pay?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3865.977s">Or</a>  that's the same thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3867.965s">It's</a>  under the same umbrella, the state has a bucket of state fiscal recovery funds, and then each municipality has gotten a bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3877.109s">So</a>  the state has chosen to take 500 million of the state funds and distribute that to low income. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3887.7s">to</a>  low-income individuals throughout Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3892.122s">And</a>  those individuals receiving that, that wouldn't preclude them from receiving the premium pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3896.205s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3896.325s">I</a>  want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3898.426s">I</a>  guess that's the only. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3901.268s">And</a>  the state earmarks, those are set by the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3904.97s">Those</a>  earmarks, that wasn't something that, OK?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3907.091s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3907.851s">One</a>  batch has been set by the legislature in Chapter 102. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3912.101s">The</a>  city is currently in the process of like working with the state to get those air, air, airlock funds in house, there will be a, the state is currently working on the next round.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3924.506s">So</a>  there will be future air marks, and where can people find out about what that money has been set for.</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3931.423s">Great</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3932.404s">I</a>  know that I have not published it anywhere, so I do not have an answer for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3936.586s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3937.847s">And</a>  then I did have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3939.288s">I</a>  saw the website to submit feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3941.93s">I've</a>  already had residents email me some feedback as far as fund spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3946.312s">Is</a>  that something we should just send to you if we're getting emails? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3948.794s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3949.034s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3951.315s">A</a>  point of information on the earmarks, you could <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3956.53s">download</a>  the PDF. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3957.59s">I</a>  think there's actually something on the state website on mass.gov that shows that your marks in the ARPA bill, and you can search by city.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3966.413s">Great,</a>  thank you, Vice President Harris. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3967.854s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3969.694s">With</a>  regards to the earmarks, do we already, you know, is it already allocated by project, or is it just the general kind of fund that we can dip into, or is it something that, like, how does it work exactly with the state earmarks?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3982.058s">Yeah,</a>  it is by project.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3984.957s">Okay,</a>  cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3985.718s">So</a>  has the city government been communicating with the state kind of reps to see how we're spending that?</p>

    <p>[Molly Kivi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=3992.703s">That</a>  is, that is what is in the works with to get those, those earmarked funds in house, the town needs to communicate with the state, but like the plans for the project to be able to be eligible to receive that grant.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4009.276s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4010.898s">If</a>  I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4012.088s">just</a>  another point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4013.29s">Um,</a>  just as the bill was, uh, under consideration, I was in communication with state representatives and Senator Jalen sending different ideas that I thought would be useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4025.523s">But</a>  I think as they consider another ARPA bill, and I'm sure that the mayor's office was similarly in communication, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4033.22s">When</a>  they consider the other bill on the other $2 billion, I think it would be useful for all members of city government to communicate any interests or priorities to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4044.67s">So</a>  we got some good stuff in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4046.131s">Duggar</a>  Park is getting a bunch of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4048.673s">Trees</a>  and stump replacement funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4051.055s">I</a>  think there's a set aside for us to, it's not enough to actually do the project, but some money set aside for the South Street and Main Street intersection reconstruction project. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4060.543s">There's</a>  a couple other ones that I don't remember.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4064.445s">Thank</a>  you very much for the discussion approval approval or receive a place on file second motion of Councilor Scarpelli to receive a file second by Vice President Bears all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4081.074s">I</a>  suppose the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4083.395s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4128.236s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4128.596s">I</a>  know that I unfortunately missed it, and I appreciate the understanding from my fellow Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4136.099s">Unfortunately,</a>  my son was injured while at school in Maine, and I was on call to pick him up. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4145.143s">They</a>  wanted him off campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4146.983s">He's</a>  fine, thank God. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4148.324s">There's</a>  no issues, but it was something that was unexpected. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4152.125s">And</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4155.044s">You</a>  love Netflix social media but we got beaten up pretty good about it but I appreciate your comments, Madam President, and just so everybody knows family does come first and this council's view in life so if I heard anybody's feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4172.26s">for</a>  the situation that I went through with my child. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4177.302s">I</a>  truly feel for those people that didn't understand the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4183.145s">So,</a>  and pretty disgusted in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4186.086s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4187.187s">And</a>  thank you for my colleagues for understanding.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4189.268s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
