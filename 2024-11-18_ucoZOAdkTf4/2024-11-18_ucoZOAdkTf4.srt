1
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:04,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau, Member Olapade, and myself, present.

2
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:06,288
[SPEAKER_06]: No student reps, I'm assuming, because it's our 515.

3
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:08,349
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll let you know if they come on at 6.

4
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,811
[SPEAKER_06]: If we may rise to salute the flag.

5
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:22,158
[SPEAKER_13]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

6
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,443
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our executive session upon motion to enter into executive session pursuant to general laws, chapter 30A, section 21A.

7
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:51,053
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford School Committee will convene an executive session to update on negotiations with Medford Educational Secretaries, AFSCME Council 93, and the Massachusetts Nurses Association, because an open meeting will have a detrimental effect on the bargaining position of the committee, and the chair so declares an executive session pursuant to 30A, section 21-2,

8
00:01:53,974 --> 00:02:01,118
[SPEAKER_06]: to conduct strategy in preparation with non-union personnel or contract negotiations with non-union personnel, our superintendent of schools.

9
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:09,902
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford School Committee will convene in public session immediately following the conclusion of executive session approximately at 6 p.m.

10
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:11,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to go into executive session?

11
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:12,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

12
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:14,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Made by member Intoppa, seconded by?

13
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:15,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

14
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:19,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Branley, roll call, member Intoppa?

15
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:19,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

16
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:20,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

17
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:20,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

18
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:21,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Branley?

19
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:21,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

20
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:22,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld?

21
00:02:23,564 --> 00:02:24,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

22
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:24,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:25,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Lopate?

24
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:25,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

25
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:27,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Myself, yes.

26
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:29,726
[SPEAKER_06]: That's seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

27
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:33,288
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna move to executive session and we'll be back on or around 6 p.m.

28
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:33,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

29
01:02:44,565 --> 01:02:52,626
[SPEAKER_14]: books from 1924 to 2023 are now available on our website to view.

30
01:02:52,646 --> 01:03:06,389
[SPEAKER_14]: There are many people with us tonight whose senior or staff pictures are featured in the digital collection, including our very own 1998 graduate of Mustang High School.

31
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, our own Mayo Lungo-Koehn.

32
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:13,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, that's 1998, if you'd like to check her out.

33
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:28,113
[SPEAKER_14]: This project was managed by the Digital Commonwealth, a Massachusetts nonprofit funded by our state budget, and in collaboration with the Boston Public Library.

34
01:03:28,813 --> 01:03:39,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Together, their goal is to both preserve and disseminate historic materials to the general public before they deteriorate and become lost forever.

35
01:03:40,794 --> 01:03:56,100
[SPEAKER_14]: All your books, as well as a 1965 newspaper article discussing the fire of the old Medford High School can be found under the students and families tab of our district's website.

36
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:11,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you to our library staff member Maria Dorsey, Medford High School ELA teacher and yearbook advisor Mr. David Ambrose, and our digitalization partners for making this project possible.

37
01:04:12,972 --> 01:04:14,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Woof woof, I said.

38
01:04:14,113 --> 01:04:17,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I am thrilled to share some great doggie news.

39
01:04:18,632 --> 01:04:24,674
[SPEAKER_14]: the Medford Public Schools Counseling Department has been matched with an assistance dog.

40
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:32,056
[SPEAKER_14]: The assistance dog will be a member of the Counseling Department, working to support students and staff.

41
01:04:32,796 --> 01:04:38,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Our newest member of Mustang Nation is expected to join us after Thanksgiving.

42
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:43,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Our Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health, Ms.

43
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:48,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Stacey Shulman, will be the handler and primary caregiver of the dog.

44
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:56,999
[SPEAKER_14]: The dog will primarily stay in her office at Medford High School, but may occasionally be seen in the halls or lobby.

45
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,243
[SPEAKER_14]: When outside her office, the dog will always be on a leash.

46
01:05:02,424 --> 01:05:16,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Given that the dog will primarily be located at the high school, we are asking families and caregivers of high school students to please contact your school nurse in relation to any dog allergies.

47
01:05:17,472 --> 01:05:17,872
[SPEAKER_14]: When Ms.

48
01:05:17,892 --> 01:05:29,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Shulman and the dog are scheduled to visit a classroom across Medford Public Schools, families and caregivers will receive prior communication from the appropriate staff member.

49
01:05:30,745 --> 01:05:37,511
[SPEAKER_14]: A wider announcement about our newest member of Mustang Nation will be shared with the community in the near future.

50
01:05:39,974 --> 01:05:40,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking ahead,

01:05:42,045 --> 01:05:43,186
[SPEAKER_14]: to this coming weekend.

52
01:05:44,266 --> 01:05:52,471

53
01:05:53,392 --> 01:06:05,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Our Middle School Drama Club will be performing a vaudeville, take two, on both Friday, November 22nd, and Saturday, November 23rd, beginning at 7 p.m.

54
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:07,700
[SPEAKER_14]: at the MacLennan School Auditorium.

55
01:06:08,922 --> 01:06:23,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Concurrently, the High School Drama Club will be performing their adaptation of Almost Maine on Thursday, November 21st, Friday the 22nd, and twice on Saturday the 23rd.

56
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:29,173
[SPEAKER_14]: The ticket links for both shows are available on our Facebook page.

57
01:06:30,113 --> 01:06:32,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Please go there to purchase your tickets.

58
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:43,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Also tomorrow, I will be sending an email communication to all families and Metro Public Schools regarding safe gun storage.

59
01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:53,656
[SPEAKER_14]: We are a proud partner with Be Smart Community Volunteers, promoting the messaging of secure and safe storage.

60
01:06:54,417 --> 01:07:00,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Please be on the lookout for that communication and more safe storage resources tomorrow afternoon.

61
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:10,926
[SPEAKER_14]: So next week, all schools will have an early release day on Wednesday, November 27th to begin the Thanksgiving break.

62
01:07:11,867 --> 01:07:18,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, Medford Public Schools will be closed on Thursday, November 28th and Friday the 29th.

63
01:07:19,753 --> 01:07:23,095
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to wish everyone an early happy Thanksgiving.

64
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:32,062
[SPEAKER_14]: May you use this time to celebrate and cherish the moments and be thankful for the tremendous impact you've had on those around you.

65
01:07:34,195 --> 01:07:39,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight's agenda is once again filled with important topics that impact our school community.

66
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:47,748
[SPEAKER_14]: We will hear a presentation on our after school care for students by our director of family and community engagement.

67
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:50,256
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Megan Fidler-Carey.

68
01:07:50,937 --> 01:07:59,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Next we'll hear from our principal of the vocational school, Mr. Chad Fallon, regarding our robust CTE enrollment.

69
01:08:00,624 --> 01:08:10,371
[SPEAKER_14]: And our final report this evening will be from our budget analyst, Mr. Gerald McHugh, regarding the FY26 school budget calendar.

70
01:08:10,851 --> 01:08:11,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

71
01:08:14,214 --> 01:08:15,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

72
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:17,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

73
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:17,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up.

74
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:20,453
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our after school report.

75
01:08:20,553 --> 01:08:24,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Megan Miss Megan Fidler-Carey, director of family and community engagement.

76
01:08:25,697 --> 01:08:26,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

77
01:08:31,562 --> 01:08:31,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi there.

78
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:32,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you all hear me?

79
01:08:36,065 --> 01:08:36,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

80
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:37,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

81
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay Um, so this is, I

82
01:08:47,393 --> 01:08:49,694
[SPEAKER_10]: a few weeks ago, just for some clarifications.

83
01:08:50,553 --> 01:08:53,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Last spring, we had, I had given an update.

84
01:08:53,594 --> 01:08:54,675
[SPEAKER_10]: That was more of a report.

85
01:08:54,715 --> 01:09:09,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Last spring, I had checked in to say, you know, give an overview of how the program went over the year and some thoughts that we had about going forward with tuition prices as they compare to other districts and pay rates as they compare to other districts.

86
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:14,002
[SPEAKER_10]: And then some questions had come up that we realized hadn't really formally been answered.

87
01:09:14,042 --> 01:09:17,303
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is, I think, more an update to answer those questions that you guys

88
01:09:17,995 --> 01:09:19,577
[SPEAKER_10]: sent over a couple of weeks ago.

89
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:26,566
[SPEAKER_10]: So I sent in a report, so that would be, I think that's available for the public if they wanted to look for that, right?

90
01:09:26,606 --> 01:09:35,557
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just some responses of attendance rates and, I mean, enrollment rates and waitlist numbers over time.

91
01:09:36,852 --> 01:09:42,680
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are for both the before programs at each of the four schools and the after school programs at each of the four schools.

92
01:09:43,321 --> 01:09:49,629
[SPEAKER_10]: And they sort of tell a story, as you all have heard me say a couple of times when I'm talking about wait lists.

93
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,814
[SPEAKER_10]: These numbers don't necessarily tell the story.

94
01:09:54,178 --> 01:10:04,103
[SPEAKER_10]: That everyone's reading so sometimes these numbers look very high and it seems alarming that there are all these people in in on a waitlist for an after school program and we're imagining.

95
01:10:04,503 --> 01:10:13,628
[SPEAKER_10]: That people are having to leave their job early to rush home and are potentially having to quit jobs what I realized a couple of times.

96
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:22,036
[SPEAKER_10]: is that, you know, for example, three weeks ago, you had put on the agenda that we would talk about this today at this November meeting.

97
01:10:22,136 --> 01:10:25,539
[SPEAKER_10]: So I updated all of my numbers for 2024.

98
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,701
[SPEAKER_10]: And they read one way.

99
01:10:28,902 --> 01:10:34,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And then over the past week, before I submitted the report to you, those numbers had changed pretty drastically.

100
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:38,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Because over that time, I reached out to families to say,

101
01:10:38,551 --> 01:10:43,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, just in an effort to keep accurate records, are you still interested in staying on this wait list?

102
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:46,917
[SPEAKER_10]: And some families had said, no, we're not interested.

103
01:10:46,957 --> 01:10:48,618
[SPEAKER_10]: We found other things you can take us off.

104
01:10:49,139 --> 01:10:53,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I realized that some of the names I had on my original list are kids that had moved.

105
01:10:54,442 --> 01:10:56,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Some kids, we were still interested.

106
01:10:56,984 --> 01:10:59,666
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we were actually able to place a couple of kids in that time.

107
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:04,009
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, it very much depends on when you look at the snapshot of these numbers.

108
01:11:04,522 --> 01:11:06,323
[SPEAKER_10]: to understand what story they're telling.

109
01:11:06,444 --> 01:11:10,226
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's really important to put out at the beginning for that number one wait list question.

110
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:12,748
[SPEAKER_10]: I should ask, is this how you guys want to do this?

111
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want me to kind of go through the questions one by one?

112
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:18,973
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds good.

113
01:11:18,993 --> 01:11:19,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

114
01:11:20,094 --> 01:11:20,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Fidelicari.

115
01:11:20,574 --> 01:11:21,315
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

116
01:11:21,915 --> 01:11:22,115
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

117
01:11:22,135 --> 01:11:30,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll read question one was current wait lists for the school year by building and a comparison of the prior three years at a comparable point in time.

118
01:11:35,623 --> 01:11:40,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them, you know, some of the buildings, they've stayed pretty static, pretty consistent over time.

119
01:11:41,888 --> 01:11:43,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them have lowered.

120
01:11:47,072 --> 01:11:49,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe if we go through question one, then question two.

121
01:11:49,554 --> 01:11:55,438
[SPEAKER_10]: So the wait list story was really what I wanted to talk to you guys about.

122
01:11:55,458 --> 01:12:02,343
[SPEAKER_10]: So is there anything that stands out that anyone has a specific question about for question one?

123
01:12:06,783 --> 01:12:09,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember Graham.

124
01:12:09,965 --> 01:12:10,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

125
01:12:10,566 --> 01:12:14,989
[SPEAKER_12]: So, if I'm reading correctly and question one, sorry.

126
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:18,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Back away from my microphone a little bit here.

127
01:12:18,872 --> 01:12:30,982
[SPEAKER_12]: What I am understanding is that for before school, there's no waitlist to speak of, except at the Brooks, and we

128
01:12:35,197 --> 01:12:42,899
[SPEAKER_12]: aren't that far away from me being able to clear the before school wait lists, I think.

129
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:57,964
[SPEAKER_12]: And for after school, the wait lists, the enrollment at, if I'm reading this correctly, the enrollment at the Brooks is decreasing, which we knew.

130
01:12:57,984 --> 01:13:01,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Enrollment at the McGlynn has increased.

131
01:13:03,944 --> 01:13:10,225
[SPEAKER_12]: The Missittuck enrollment has decreased slightly and the Roberts has stayed flat, roughly.

132
01:13:10,245 --> 01:13:28,689
[SPEAKER_12]: And the wait list is quite small at McGlynn and Missittuck, pretty consistent at the Roberts and biggest at the Brooks.

133
01:13:28,789 --> 01:13:30,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that correct?

134
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:39,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and actually, as we go through the next couple of questions, which are looking at the other after school options in the area.

135
01:13:41,032 --> 01:13:44,037
[SPEAKER_10]: You also notice that the percentages.

136
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:52,814
[SPEAKER_10]: of those students on the waitlist, you know, you're correct, highest at the Brooks, that are also enrolled in another program.

137
01:13:53,114 --> 01:13:55,175
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's, again, they're not just, they're not going home.

138
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:57,817
[SPEAKER_10]: They are enrolled in another program.

139
01:13:57,937 --> 01:14:05,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, I think it's worth noting that I think the word is out that it's hard to get into the Brooks afterschool program.

140
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,302
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of people, once they're on that waitlist, they hold on to that spot.

141
01:14:08,882 --> 01:14:10,443
[SPEAKER_10]: whether they've found another program or not.

142
01:14:10,483 --> 01:14:15,146
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I did reach out to a Brooks family to say, great news, a spot has opened up for you.

143
01:14:15,706 --> 01:14:16,747
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were really torn.

144
01:14:16,787 --> 01:14:20,929
[SPEAKER_10]: She said, oh no, I feel like I have to take the spot because I know how hard it is to get into this program.

145
01:14:21,449 --> 01:14:24,211
[SPEAKER_10]: And she took a whole week to talk it over with the family.

146
01:14:24,271 --> 01:14:26,492
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they decided to stay with Sigma in the end.

147
01:14:26,812 --> 01:14:28,213
[SPEAKER_10]: They decided not to take the spot.

148
01:14:28,694 --> 01:14:34,237
[SPEAKER_10]: So they were holding the wait list spot because they know how hard it is to get into.

149
01:14:34,297 --> 01:14:38,139
[SPEAKER_10]: But then when the spot opened up, they realized maybe it wasn't the best program for their student.

150
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:46,421
[SPEAKER_12]: And Megan, can you tell us what is the difference for the Brooks under the wait list for afterschool?

151
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:49,081
[SPEAKER_12]: 127 parentheses 57.

152
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:55,502
[SPEAKER_10]: So the 57 is how many students are in other private provider programs.

153
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:59,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I realized that we were going to be talking about that in other places.

154
01:15:02,384 --> 01:15:02,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.

155
01:15:03,004 --> 01:15:03,084
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

156
01:15:04,028 --> 01:15:05,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, that that is helpful.

157
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:23,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so can you I guess the other question that I have when I look at this piece of the puzzle is that I think I was under the impression that things would improve at McGlynn and Mississippi specifically because of city year and that does not seem to have been the case.

158
01:15:23,702 --> 01:15:26,244
[SPEAKER_12]: So can you talk a little bit about why?

159
01:15:26,264 --> 01:15:26,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Um,

160
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:46,792
[SPEAKER_10]: City Year is a nice add-on, but because of the, they've been working with us, but initially at the beginning of the year, because of the schedule that they had and the trainings that they were holding, they were not available to us right at dismissal, which is the most important time for us.

161
01:15:46,892 --> 01:15:55,777
[SPEAKER_10]: You can imagine that's when the building feels the most, for lack of a better word, chaotic, because there's a lot of transitions happening, students passing in the hallway.

162
01:15:57,441 --> 01:16:01,082
[SPEAKER_10]: If you know what's happening and you know that everybody knows where they're going, it's very impressive.

163
01:16:01,322 --> 01:16:05,284
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you don't know what's happening, it feels like there's just kids everywhere going in every direction.

164
01:16:05,884 --> 01:16:16,148
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can imagine that that's when I definitely need my after school staff on where they're supposed to be and alert because they have to be checking students in.

165
01:16:16,168 --> 01:16:18,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have a very short turnaround time.

166
01:16:18,889 --> 01:16:24,811
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's a student that is supposed to be with us in our line and is not, then we have to find them, which requires

167
01:16:25,267 --> 01:16:33,530
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, an adult to break away from the group of children to go to the main office and say, were they dismissed and we weren't told or to call home to the family and find the kids.

168
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:41,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a little bit of a, um, and that's where we were hoping that the city or people being on staff and on site would be helpful to us.

169
01:16:41,493 --> 01:16:44,554
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know that at the same time, the school buildings were feeling the same way.

170
01:16:44,594 --> 01:16:50,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Like this is a great time for the city or people to be on staff and on site to help with bus dismissals and to help with bus transitions.

171
01:16:51,196 --> 01:16:56,720
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a lot of transitions right at that time that require a lot of very alert adults.

172
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:01,302
[SPEAKER_10]: And initially, the City Year folks were being put to work by the school buildings.

173
01:17:01,603 --> 01:17:08,687
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had a conversation with the principals and we had a conversation with City Year folks, and they were willing to adapt and change a little bit.

174
01:17:09,127 --> 01:17:10,368
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're seeing how that's working.

175
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:11,709
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not every day.

176
01:17:12,389 --> 01:17:13,470
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not five days a week.

177
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:15,631
[SPEAKER_10]: So we couldn't just kind of give them their own group.

178
01:17:17,765 --> 01:17:26,469
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wasn't as much the, it wasn't kind of another that we could just take 20 more kids or 12 more kids to put with that staff member it wasn't like that that we had hoped it would be.

179
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:31,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for clarifying that.

180
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:37,642
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like that's the opposite of our impression of the value that City Year was going to bring to the table.

181
01:17:37,742 --> 01:17:53,670
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm really disappointed to hear that because part of the reason we made space in a really tight budget to be able to do this was to alleviate some of the real staffing issues that we have in the building and buildings.

182
01:17:55,351 --> 01:18:09,039
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we're not actually solving those problems, I would be interested to learn more about the value that the team is bringing to the table and whether it's justified for us to continue the partnership.

183
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:12,501
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's not a question you can answer, Ms.

184
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:19,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Fidler-Carey, because that's a city year question, but just something that I think we should all be thinking about.

185
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:40,412
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, I think- I mean, I do feel like I'm obligated to say that they have said they're willing to work with us, but so then, you know, so I'm happy to sit down and try and rework it again, but it just requires me being like, well, can I have the people five days a week, which I'm not sure that that's what the model is, so.

186
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:57,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I thought it was the model so I would definitely like to know more about that because, you know, this is an annual expense and if we're going to spend money we need to make sure that we're getting what we thought we were getting from it and

187
01:18:58,468 --> 01:19:03,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I get that there's stuff that happens in a new relationship that you work out the kinks.

188
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:10,433
[SPEAKER_12]: But if the kinks are forever, then that limits the value.

189
01:19:10,493 --> 01:19:12,654
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just need to sort that out.

190
01:19:13,734 --> 01:19:17,176
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess the other thing that I know when we talk about

191
01:19:18,956 --> 01:19:23,318
[SPEAKER_12]: need the before school program is not the biggest need.

192
01:19:23,378 --> 01:19:25,618
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the thing people email us about.

193
01:19:26,599 --> 01:19:30,280
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do think it strikes me as the most fixable problem.

194
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:39,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it strikes me as there's a handful of kids and there is space to be able to take in eight kids at the Brooks, one kid at Mississippi Tech and

195
01:19:40,444 --> 01:19:41,705
[SPEAKER_12]: two kids at the Roberts.

196
01:19:41,785 --> 01:19:50,789
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would be interested to know from your perspective, like what would it take for us to be able to clear those before school wait lists?

197
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:56,633
[SPEAKER_12]: And how can we, how can, how can we help sort of push that?

198
01:19:58,994 --> 01:19:59,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can say that.

199
01:20:02,276 --> 01:20:05,837
[SPEAKER_10]: So for some of the students, it will might require specialized staff.

200
01:20:07,478 --> 01:20:08,859
[SPEAKER_10]: As we've, you know, we've had that

201
01:20:09,443 --> 01:20:14,525
[SPEAKER_10]: in the past at the Roberts, where we had to have staff that were specifically trained to meet the needs of students.

202
01:20:16,085 --> 01:20:18,966
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that is the case for a couple of these kids on the wait list.

203
01:20:20,007 --> 01:20:25,689
[SPEAKER_10]: At the Missittuck, we realized we had two staff members originally, and now we're down to just one.

204
01:20:26,089 --> 01:20:34,132
[SPEAKER_10]: The second staff member who was new to the district this year and signed on right away, realized that she actually couldn't continue, so we just have one staff member.

205
01:20:34,952 --> 01:20:38,373
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that one student on the Missittuck wait list joined

206
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,838
[SPEAKER_10]: after the second person had left.

207
01:20:40,938 --> 01:20:44,760
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hesitate to keep adding to that group until a second staff member can be hired.

208
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:51,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Because just as you know, if there's an emergency and there's only, if they're up in the gym and there's only one adult, it's just not an ideal situation.

209
01:20:52,943 --> 01:20:58,065
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's really a matter of having the staff that can meet the needs of the specific students that we're talking about.

210
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:05,289
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, if we can find those staff, then I definitely think you're right, that that's a really doable fix.

211
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,970
[SPEAKER_10]: That one's not a space issue for exchange.

212
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:28,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so I guess I'm wondering if perhaps working with Miss Bowen to identify what those students needs are and identify staff that may be a match and maybe put out some emails, letting the right people know that we are looking for somebody with a particular skill set.

213
01:21:29,508 --> 01:21:30,468
[SPEAKER_12]: who might be interested.

214
01:21:30,488 --> 01:21:38,190
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's only an hour in the morning, so there may be people willing to do it if we can be specific about what we need.

215
01:21:40,371 --> 01:21:53,955
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, it's not the biggest problem that we have when it comes to the overall issue, but it is a fixable one, probably perhaps more fixable than the other issues, as far as I can tell.

216
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:05,033
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also have question one or shall I go ahead to the next?

217
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:08,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I agree that maybe the questions will kind of overlap.

218
01:22:09,275 --> 01:22:10,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please continue.

219
01:22:10,576 --> 01:22:11,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

220
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:19,021
[SPEAKER_10]: So question number two says enrollment information at outside programs and a summary of the offerings Medford is supporting by transportation.

221
01:22:19,841 --> 01:22:24,664
[SPEAKER_10]: So these outs, what we're calling outside programs are the private providers in the city of Medford.

222
01:22:25,104 --> 01:22:30,267
[SPEAKER_10]: So many of you have heard of Graceworks, Sigma Martial Arts, Salem Street Karate Studios,

223
01:22:30,694 --> 01:22:32,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford Youth Center, YMCA.

224
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:34,551
[SPEAKER_10]: The Ready, Set, Kids.

225
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:41,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Ready, Set, Kids has another program called RSK STEAM and also the West Medford Community Center.

226
01:22:41,736 --> 01:22:45,498
[SPEAKER_10]: And these, I have a good working relationship with all of these guys.

227
01:22:45,538 --> 01:22:47,520
[SPEAKER_10]: We keep in touch with each other regularly.

228
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:52,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, I did not get updated roster numbers from Salem Street Karate Studios.

229
01:22:53,164 --> 01:22:57,586
[SPEAKER_10]: So the number, you'll see that numbers in parentheses, that's only the number of students that go by bus.

230
01:22:58,127 --> 01:23:01,029
[SPEAKER_10]: So that doesn't capture any of the Roberts Studios.

231
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:02,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I hadn't heard back from them.

232
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:17,153
[SPEAKER_10]: in time to get the report out, but you'll notice that we do transport 237 students to these afterschool programs from our elementary schools by bus, all of them.

233
01:23:17,633 --> 01:23:27,135
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and that dovetails nice with question three or overlaps with question three, which is for each wait list, the percentage of students on our wait list who are enrolled elsewhere.

234
01:23:27,615 --> 01:23:32,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I realized I didn't fill in that bottom line, which is the actual percentages,

235
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:38,965
[SPEAKER_10]: So for Brooks, it's 46% of the waitlist are enrolled in one of these private provider programs.

236
01:23:39,446 --> 01:23:40,827
[SPEAKER_10]: At McGlynn, it's 20%.

237
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:41,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Missituk is 14%.

238
01:23:43,389 --> 01:23:44,210
[SPEAKER_10]: And Roberts is 29%.

239
01:23:44,390 --> 01:24:00,363
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look at the numbers of how many students are enrolled in the different programs, it'll show what I said before, which is the Brooks students stay on our waitlist, where

240
01:24:00,856 --> 01:24:14,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Missittuck and McGlynn, for example, they have more students enrolled in those outside programs that then forfeit their waitlist spot with me because they say, no thanks, I no longer need that because I'm in this other afterschool program, so I don't need to stay on your waitlist anymore.

241
01:24:15,882 --> 01:24:20,943
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that that's just a result, again, what do these numbers, what story do these numbers tell us?

242
01:24:20,983 --> 01:24:27,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a result of people knowing how hard it is to get into Brooks and hesitating to forfeit their waitlist spot.

243
01:24:30,362 --> 01:24:36,445
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's stop with those two, because those are still about our elementary school after school as it exists.

244
01:24:36,565 --> 01:24:40,967
[SPEAKER_10]: And then question four and five are more looking to the future and thinking about what other possibilities there are.

245
01:24:41,007 --> 01:24:44,049
[SPEAKER_10]: So are there any specific questions about question two and three?

246
01:24:44,069 --> 01:24:48,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see any, so you can continue.

247
01:24:48,171 --> 01:24:48,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

248
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:49,191
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

249
01:24:50,782 --> 01:24:57,489
[SPEAKER_10]: So the question for says you had asked about a description of efforts pursued in creating a program at the Andrews.

250
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:04,556
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is, I believe I started to tell in the spring, some plans that we had in progress.

251
01:25:04,997 --> 01:25:06,738
[SPEAKER_10]: We had some discussions in the works.

252
01:25:07,659 --> 01:25:09,301
[SPEAKER_10]: We put out an RFP.

253
01:25:11,543 --> 01:25:11,924
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like a

254
01:25:13,365 --> 01:25:17,387
[SPEAKER_10]: not so much a request for a quote, but as much a request, it was a quote and programming ideas.

255
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:19,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And we got back a couple of different options.

256
01:25:20,068 --> 01:25:23,650
[SPEAKER_10]: And the one that we selected was from SNL Sports Academy.

257
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:29,112
[SPEAKER_10]: The report has the link to that, but you can also easily Google them, SNL Sports Academy.

258
01:25:30,085 --> 01:25:34,188
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were going to, they came and we did a walkthrough at the Andrews Middle School.

259
01:25:34,608 --> 01:25:58,901
[SPEAKER_10]: And the idea that we were working on was having the middle school be, or at the Andrews Middle School, which is the only building that's not being used for afterschool programming, to have the fourth and fifth graders from the elementary schools take a bus over and do a sports-focused program at the Andrews, which would free up a lot of spaces for the littler kids, which is where the highest concentration of the wait lists are at the elementary schools.

260
01:26:00,128 --> 01:26:07,291
[SPEAKER_10]: We were hoping that that would alleviate it and the students that weren't necessarily interested in a sports focused one could go to the YMCA.

261
01:26:07,311 --> 01:26:18,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, sorry, the West Mansford Cultural Community Center because that caters to 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th as well and does sort of, they sort of do more computer programming and that kind of thing.

262
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:25,985
[SPEAKER_10]: we thought we would be able to tap into both of the interests, but open up some more spots at the elementary school.

263
01:26:26,546 --> 01:26:30,549
[SPEAKER_10]: So SNL Sports Academy was really open to any of our ideas.

264
01:26:30,609 --> 01:26:34,331
[SPEAKER_10]: They were really excited to say they would make it work.

265
01:26:34,471 --> 01:26:41,176
[SPEAKER_10]: And their model is they partner with colleges and hire student athletes to come work in the afterschool program.

266
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:49,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the first question I asked, the first question I ask anybody who tries to say that they can come help us with our wait lists is, how are we not competing for the same staff?

267
01:26:50,489 --> 01:27:01,674
[SPEAKER_10]: because we're competing for people who are willing to work from two to six, which is a very small group of people, as we've talked about many times, how are you going to find different people than I would just find to hire myself?

268
01:27:02,115 --> 01:27:09,879
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was their answer, which I thought was very attractive and compelling, is that they partner with colleges, with sports teams and coaches, and they hire college athletes.

269
01:27:12,196 --> 01:27:20,803
[SPEAKER_10]: We ran into, we were running into a few logistical problems over the summer, trying to figure out how our middle school basketball was going to work out, how the spacing issues were going to work out at the Andrews.

270
01:27:21,483 --> 01:27:30,651
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, just as I was starting to get a little bit panicked that that wouldn't work out, we got a message from the bus company that said there was no way they were going to be able to provide the buses anyway.

271
01:27:31,031 --> 01:27:35,595
[SPEAKER_10]: So that, you know, killed that idea dead in the water in about July.

272
01:27:36,475 --> 01:27:36,936
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know,

273
01:27:38,424 --> 01:27:42,746
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not talking about transportation in this meeting today, but it does overlap considerably.

274
01:27:43,226 --> 01:27:50,028
[SPEAKER_10]: The bus driver shortage, the national bus driver shortage has a direct effect on us and our afterschool opportunities.

275
01:27:51,189 --> 01:28:02,873
[SPEAKER_10]: So the more we try and get creative about things outside of the school buildings that require us to then partner with our bus company to provide a bus, the more challenges we possibly face with that.

276
01:28:02,973 --> 01:28:04,673
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's something we really need to consider.

277
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:16,192
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we can figure out the bus situation, I think that everybody's on board, we'd have to still continue the logistics of the middle school activities.

278
01:28:16,473 --> 01:28:19,854
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that that's a problem that we're all willing to work on.

279
01:28:20,334 --> 01:28:23,996
[SPEAKER_10]: So that could start in the fall if we could get that fixed.

280
01:28:25,297 --> 01:28:26,597
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll continue working on that one.

281
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:32,661
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other thing, and this is something that I've been working on for a few years.

282
01:28:32,881 --> 01:28:45,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I think I mentioned this in the spring, I was working with the mayor's zoning department or development department to try and say, what can we do for anybody who's interested in coming to Medford to open up a business?

283
01:28:46,226 --> 01:28:55,290
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had reached out to other businesses that I've just heard of, that I've worked with in the past in different districts I've worked in, or heard about in different towns where I've lived.

284
01:28:55,734 --> 01:28:58,636
[SPEAKER_10]: and said, hey, is there any chance you'd want to open up in Medford?

285
01:28:58,836 --> 01:29:00,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And there were a couple that actually were.

286
01:29:00,937 --> 01:29:07,400
[SPEAKER_10]: They're interested in moving to Medford and opening up their own private space in a storefront or a building.

287
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,921
[SPEAKER_10]: And they would run an after-school program.

288
01:29:09,981 --> 01:29:12,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's nice is they would all be just a little bit different.

289
01:29:13,003 --> 01:29:15,764
[SPEAKER_10]: So it could be meeting the actual needs and interests of the students.

290
01:29:17,731 --> 01:29:20,253
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm really hopeful that that can still take off.

291
01:29:21,413 --> 01:29:25,476
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm happy to do anything to sort of facilitate those conversations.

292
01:29:25,636 --> 01:29:27,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the problem in the city has been space.

293
01:29:28,278 --> 01:29:32,461
[SPEAKER_10]: There just aren't enough buildings that are appropriate for this.

294
01:29:32,941 --> 01:29:40,146
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that at least one of the organizations that's interested in moving into Medford has looked at both St.

295
01:29:40,206 --> 01:29:41,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Francis and St.

296
01:29:41,647 --> 01:29:42,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Clements.

297
01:29:42,796 --> 01:29:46,817
[SPEAKER_10]: to move into, and they both just need extraordinary amounts of work.

298
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:54,860
[SPEAKER_10]: They have been, I wonder if it's because they were, I'm not sure why, but they didn't have to keep up with any ADA standards.

299
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:02,323
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't have to keep up with any of the building standards that were required to keep up for the Department of Education.

300
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:09,965
[SPEAKER_10]: They weren't, and so the buildings would need a lot of work and updating to get compliant.

301
01:30:10,826 --> 01:30:16,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody that opened up in those buildings, even if it was us, even if we decided we wanted to partner with St.

302
01:30:17,031 --> 01:30:27,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Clemens and open up a school satellite afterschool program, the building would have to become licensable by the early EEC, what is that?

303
01:30:27,278 --> 01:30:31,562
[SPEAKER_10]: The Early Education and Care Department, which is who oversees

304
01:30:32,963 --> 01:30:34,404
[SPEAKER_10]: school age after school programs.

305
01:30:34,604 --> 01:30:40,067
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it would require just a lot of work, a lot of renovation and money.

306
01:30:41,168 --> 01:30:44,990
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that those conversations are still happening.

307
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:50,174
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, I don't know if they're at negotiation phase with those companies and St.

308
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:51,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Clements, because I think St.

309
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:53,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Clements is sort of eager to do something with that empty space.

310
01:30:55,066 --> 01:31:06,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure how appropriate it is for us to be a big part of those conversations, but whatever help I can do, I can make introductions or I can take notes at meetings.

311
01:31:07,035 --> 01:31:07,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to do that.

312
01:31:07,975 --> 01:31:18,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, as we've said, I'll do my best to set up transportation for students to get to those places, but that's required if we have the drivers for it.

313
01:31:22,366 --> 01:31:23,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll stop there and see if there are any

314
01:31:24,758 --> 01:31:25,218
[SPEAKER_10]: questions.

315
01:31:25,378 --> 01:31:29,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and I mean, the other thing that we've talked about in the past is the recreation department.

316
01:31:31,382 --> 01:31:36,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Kevin and I had talked a couple of times about what different possibilities there were about him using the Andrews or him.

317
01:31:37,405 --> 01:31:40,327
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the Hegner Center, right, is on its way.

318
01:31:41,728 --> 01:31:41,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

319
01:31:42,548 --> 01:31:43,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

320
01:31:43,749 --> 01:31:44,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Fidlukari.

321
01:31:44,389 --> 01:31:53,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the Hegner Center is, we're working through rehabbing that location to create an afterschool program through Medford Rec.

322
01:31:55,222 --> 01:31:58,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I'm not sure it'll be until 2020, late 2025, 26 is our hope.

323
01:31:58,751 --> 01:32:00,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

324
01:32:05,751 --> 01:32:08,653
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's no further questions there are member Reinfeld.

325
01:32:09,013 --> 01:32:24,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, so I have a lot of questions about the transportation logistics and I, this is probably not the time because we need more specific proposals but the concerns about busing students from every single elementary school to every other corner of the city around seems like a

326
01:32:25,841 --> 01:32:36,124
[SPEAKER_11]: huge challenge but I think we can't have that conversation until there are more specific sites, so I just wanted to ask about the SNL Sports Academy and partnering with local colleges.

327
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:47,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they have the ability to provide that consistent program for the duration of the public school school year because a lot of college schedules are very different than the schedule.

328
01:32:50,588 --> 01:33:13,823
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds a little bit like SNL Sports Academy does one-time events and provides programming in after-school programs that have a base core staff versus having, are the student athletes the ones who are responsible for the full-time staffing for the duration of the public school year starting in August, ending in June, and having

329
01:33:15,385 --> 01:33:16,506
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a great question.

330
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:26,912
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a lot of challenges that college students have throughout the year that take them away from a regular weekly commitment.

331
01:33:26,992 --> 01:33:32,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone who's worked with college student workers knows that consistent staffing is a challenge.

332
01:33:34,437 --> 01:33:38,859
[SPEAKER_10]: So we actually ended up partnering with SNL Sports Academy anyway.

333
01:33:40,461 --> 01:33:51,766
[SPEAKER_10]: They when this wasn't working out, I went to them and said, well, you know, since we can't do the Andrews thing, can you actually help with my staffing problems at the at our four sites?

334
01:33:51,846 --> 01:33:52,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And they said yes.

335
01:33:52,486 --> 01:33:56,308
[SPEAKER_10]: So they provide some staff at each of the elementary schools currently.

336
01:33:56,988 --> 01:33:58,089
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing gym games.

337
01:33:58,249 --> 01:34:00,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So that has helped relieve our staffing.

338
01:34:02,668 --> 01:34:04,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Not considerably, but it has helped really.

339
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,089
[SPEAKER_10]: It has definitely helped.

340
01:34:06,489 --> 01:34:15,832
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have two to four SNL staff members come every day to each of the elementary school programs, and they are in charge of the gym games.

341
01:34:15,912 --> 01:34:17,412
[SPEAKER_10]: And so our students cycle through.

342
01:34:17,452 --> 01:34:18,292
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on a rotation.

343
01:34:18,892 --> 01:34:23,434
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they were there the whole year.

344
01:34:24,294 --> 01:34:25,074
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good question.

345
01:34:25,114 --> 01:34:26,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure how that works.

346
01:34:26,415 --> 01:34:29,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we don't have the exact same people every single day.

347
01:34:33,058 --> 01:34:35,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine it's because of different sports.

348
01:34:35,059 --> 01:34:48,768
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm actually hoping that we'll get some of the football players that they, when they originally gave us their pitch, they were sort of describing big football players coming in and the, you know, the little kids being so wowed by the football players, but obviously it was football season this year.

349
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:51,550
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they, we didn't get football players working in the afterschool program.

350
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:57,674
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm hoping now that the season's kind of coming to a close that some of them will work in our winter programs.

351
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:03,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, many of the students that we have now are college students.

352
01:35:03,801 --> 01:35:11,164
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not necessarily, I mean, they're athletes, but they're not kind of coming from the big sports teams like I imagined when I heard that too.

353
01:35:12,945 --> 01:35:18,087
[SPEAKER_10]: They've told us that they're giving us staff members every day, and so far they have.

354
01:35:18,928 --> 01:35:19,728
[SPEAKER_10]: It hasn't been a problem.

355
01:35:19,888 --> 01:35:26,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's really nice also is that there's a supervisor for each of them that splits by two schools.

356
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:28,472
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have two supervisors in the city

357
01:35:29,005 --> 01:35:32,968
[SPEAKER_10]: that check in on their staff at each of the schools.

358
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:35,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

359
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:38,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Ruseau.

360
01:35:39,253 --> 01:35:39,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

361
01:35:40,073 --> 01:35:44,016
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the endless work on this.

362
01:35:44,657 --> 01:35:46,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize it's your job too, so of course.

363
01:35:46,178 --> 01:35:54,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I obviously think that what's going on in the programs is very important, but

364
01:35:55,686 --> 01:36:03,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you describe for me, for all of us, what happens if you don't have the required number of staff for students?

365
01:36:04,933 --> 01:36:09,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that there's, how many people are typically with a group of students?

366
01:36:09,957 --> 01:36:15,601
[SPEAKER_10]: So the ratio that I try to keep is one to 10, but licensing requires one to 13.

367
01:36:16,942 --> 01:36:19,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I try to do one to 10, knowing that we often have staff out.

368
01:36:20,825 --> 01:36:25,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, let's say that, you know, you're way under the ratios people called in sick.

369
01:36:27,561 --> 01:36:29,302
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a substitute pool.

370
01:36:30,663 --> 01:36:34,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that anybody else does for any other area except for, well anyways.

371
01:36:36,468 --> 01:36:42,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens in the district when you are not going to have enough people to be with the kids?

372
01:36:45,015 --> 01:36:50,379
[SPEAKER_10]: So luckily we don't get in as much trouble as a private company would.

373
01:36:50,979 --> 01:36:53,942
[SPEAKER_10]: We are license exempt because we are in a school building.

374
01:36:54,827 --> 01:36:59,131
[SPEAKER_10]: because the state has already decided that this building is safe enough for students to be there all day.

375
01:36:59,151 --> 01:37:05,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Our afterschool program does not need to meet the strict licensing standards.

376
01:37:05,436 --> 01:37:11,621
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can therefore get to know the kids and the needs of the kids in a different way and staff accordingly.

377
01:37:11,882 --> 01:37:13,503
[SPEAKER_10]: So that actually happened today.

378
01:37:13,523 --> 01:37:19,228
[SPEAKER_10]: At the Brooks, I pitch in almost every day when we're short-staffed.

379
01:37:19,268 --> 01:37:20,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I was at the Brooks today after school.

380
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:22,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I got called in because

381
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:24,772
[SPEAKER_10]: three of our staff members called out.

382
01:37:25,492 --> 01:37:31,714
[SPEAKER_10]: And in one of our groups in particular, and it's a group that just coincidentally, most of the parents pick up pretty late in the day.

383
01:37:31,734 --> 01:37:34,975
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've got four higher needs kids in that group.

384
01:37:35,395 --> 01:37:40,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that requires a lot of thoughtful staffing.

385
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:50,321
[SPEAKER_10]: So I went and I kind of broke the, helped break the group in sections.

386
01:37:52,014 --> 01:37:54,876
[SPEAKER_10]: so that we could help with the, we could address the needs of the different kids.

387
01:37:55,357 --> 01:38:03,043
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what we do in that situation is not ideally, but if we were very short staffed, we would just put the group in more of an assembly format.

388
01:38:03,103 --> 01:38:06,085
[SPEAKER_10]: So we would bring them all to one place so that there were

389
01:38:08,463 --> 01:38:21,051
[SPEAKER_10]: I never like to have any of the staff by themselves, obviously, so there's always two adults with kids for the reasons as I described if somebody gets hurt, and you need to give them one on one attention or take them from the area there's got to be another adult in the room.

390
01:38:21,952 --> 01:38:28,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's always at least two but it doesn't need to be that one to 10 ratio if everybody's in the same room so if you're all in the gym playing a gym game.

391
01:38:30,678 --> 01:38:43,861
[SPEAKER_10]: that's not ideal because you know not all the kids like a gym game so we like to tailor it a little bit more and to have some quiet games and some creative crafts types things and then some of the sports stuff but if we were short staffed it would just mean

392
01:38:44,861 --> 01:38:47,522
[SPEAKER_10]: kids couldn't, uh, we couldn't individualize it as much.

393
01:38:48,002 --> 01:39:02,768
[SPEAKER_10]: So for example, at the Brooks last part of, we had some incidents come up at the Brooks last week because, um, two of our kids in one of the groups really don't like the gym games, but the art teacher who we usually have on staff was out for two days.

394
01:39:03,108 --> 01:39:06,269
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that meant that we had to, we had to consolidate some groups.

395
01:39:06,309 --> 01:39:12,952
[SPEAKER_10]: So this one student who usually we keep out of the gym games, we really just needed her to go there and it didn't end well.

396
01:39:13,351 --> 01:39:18,994
[SPEAKER_10]: It ended in students having some meltdowns and getting in some, just being unhappy.

397
01:39:19,054 --> 01:39:24,357
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it's a long day for a lot of these kids, some who were in before and after school.

398
01:39:24,557 --> 01:39:29,360
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they're doing these things that they don't want to, and if we have to consolidate like that, it's not ideal.

399
01:39:31,769 --> 01:39:35,470
[SPEAKER_10]: But our staff does a really great job of getting to know the kids really well.

400
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:40,972
[SPEAKER_10]: So they take a pulse on that sort of thing and kind of make adjustments accordingly.

401
01:39:41,552 --> 01:39:50,454
[SPEAKER_10]: And they might consolidate only the kids that are up for that and that don't mind being in a big group of everybody and put the right staff with it.

402
01:39:50,494 --> 01:39:55,055
[SPEAKER_10]: They're very thoughtful about it and making those adjustments, but it's definitely not ideal.

403
01:39:56,716 --> 01:39:57,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

404
01:39:57,236 --> 01:40:00,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly wouldn't have suggested it was anything but thoughtful.

405
01:40:01,477 --> 01:40:15,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when the director has to fill in, the director's not doing your other job, which is continuous recruitment, program evaluation and development and all that other stuff.

406
01:40:16,061 --> 01:40:28,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I think about us adding, most school committee members have heard, why don't we just hire tough students or even high school kids or young adults,

407
01:40:29,798 --> 01:40:31,339
[SPEAKER_01]: what is right where it is.

408
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:39,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And and the answer is, we can't just not have anybody there because they you know, the sports teams is a really good example.

409
01:40:39,225 --> 01:40:44,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we use them for our ratios, well, they're gonna go get on a bus and go somewhere to play a game.

410
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:50,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And can't just have the kids in the room without some adults.

411
01:40:50,994 --> 01:40:54,297
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you know, we don't we don't want to end up with the director and

412
01:40:54,878 --> 01:41:02,647
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to assistant superintendents and the superintendent and everybody just like having to do after school programming.

413
01:41:03,788 --> 01:41:08,494
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we keep increasing it and we are dependent on people that are not

414
01:41:11,676 --> 01:41:18,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that they're not reliable people, but their schedule makes it so that they are not going to be a reliable body to be with the students.

415
01:41:18,997 --> 01:41:20,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I just get very concerned.

416
01:41:20,998 --> 01:41:23,338
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always the solution I keep hearing about.

417
01:41:24,158 --> 01:41:29,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Students, in any capacity, I mean, college gets out before public schools do.

418
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:36,781
[SPEAKER_01]: My memory is that winter break for colleges is a lot longer than it is for public schools.

419
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:51,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying we shouldn't use them for the way you are using them now, because I think the activities and that all sounds great, but that doesn't solve our capacity problem in my mind.

420
01:41:52,357 --> 01:42:06,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to make that point because we can't be paying you to be filling in as an on the ground person.

421
01:42:07,731 --> 01:42:10,113
[SPEAKER_01]: and also expect you to continue doing your regular job.

422
01:42:10,313 --> 01:42:10,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

423
01:42:14,196 --> 01:42:15,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Miss Fidelicari.

424
01:42:15,858 --> 01:42:16,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

425
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:17,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

426
01:42:17,719 --> 01:42:26,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have a number of buses that it would take for the Andrews to become viable?

427
01:42:28,477 --> 01:42:35,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, originally when I was thinking it, I was saying 20 students from each school because that would make 80 students for that group.

428
01:42:36,581 --> 01:42:38,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Now SNL kept saying they thought they could take more.

429
01:42:38,762 --> 01:42:44,964
[SPEAKER_10]: They could take up to 100, but I wanted to kind of work it out and make sure it works first for all of the concerns that we just mentioned.

430
01:42:45,665 --> 01:42:49,746
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was really thinking just 20 from each school, which would be 4 buses.

431
01:42:50,787 --> 01:42:55,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't necessarily be 4 buses, but it would be 20 seats, which as we know,

432
01:42:56,147 --> 01:43:01,669
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there's any bus at any of the elementary school that has 20 seats free in it that we could add that stop.

433
01:43:03,809 --> 01:43:09,671
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and presumably the students at the McGlynn wouldn't need a bus.

434
01:43:10,211 --> 01:43:10,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

435
01:43:10,571 --> 01:43:10,871
[SPEAKER_12]: You're right.

436
01:43:10,891 --> 01:43:12,432
[SPEAKER_12]: So three, that's right, three buses.

437
01:43:14,412 --> 01:43:19,494
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think my question is 20, more than 20 kids fit on a bus.

438
01:43:21,451 --> 01:43:30,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it really three whole extra buses, or is there some lesser number of buses that would make this viable?

439
01:43:30,173 --> 01:43:32,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there is, but that's what I was saying.

440
01:43:32,813 --> 01:43:35,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think at the, you're right, the three schools.

441
01:43:35,754 --> 01:43:39,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there are 20 free seats on any one of the buses that are there.

442
01:43:39,955 --> 01:43:42,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we would just have to do some configuring.

443
01:43:43,435 --> 01:43:50,177
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be a challenge at the Roberts where we need a fourth bus as it is, and the Brooks where we only just got a fourth bus.

444
01:43:51,721 --> 01:43:54,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I think those would need an extra bus.

445
01:43:55,743 --> 01:44:02,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the McGlynn, they could reconfigure the stops and sort of make it so that they could fit it on one of their fourth buses.

446
01:44:05,749 --> 01:44:18,477
[SPEAKER_10]: And I imagine a bus that could pick up it, because you can fit those 60 kids on one bus, but that's not time effective to go to all three of the schools to pick up before they go to the Andrews, especially at that time of day, that would be.

447
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:29,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the reason I ask, I think it's worth figuring out what the real number is so that we are coming up on the end of our bus contract.

448
01:44:29,558 --> 01:44:39,966
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to make these kinds of asks and we're going to need to be like precise and specific about it because we don't have an endless amount of money for buses.

449
01:44:40,046 --> 01:44:42,268
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to know what all the needs are.

450
01:44:42,288 --> 01:44:45,611
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it sounds like,

451
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:50,261
[SPEAKER_12]: your office probably has the data that we need there.

452
01:44:50,341 --> 01:44:59,245
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just like you to pull that together so that when the time comes, we have an answer that is a little bit more precise available.

453
01:44:59,265 --> 01:45:00,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

454
01:45:02,106 --> 01:45:03,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

455
01:45:03,687 --> 01:45:10,750
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other comment I wanted to make is I have heard from parents repeatedly that

456
01:45:16,786 --> 01:45:18,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Things haven't gotten better.

457
01:45:18,588 --> 01:45:20,910
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that they have.

458
01:45:22,031 --> 01:45:33,100
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that the reason that they have gotten better is because of all of these outside organizations that have come to Medford right so our collective capacity has increased.

459
01:45:34,577 --> 01:45:41,085
[SPEAKER_12]: your report doesn't necessarily show that and we didn't, I didn't ask for that so I don't understand.

460
01:45:42,046 --> 01:45:53,520
[SPEAKER_12]: But it does, you know, I think it would be useful, maybe even just to add some of those like the comments that you've shared with us tonight like this report can

461
01:45:54,773 --> 01:46:19,175
[SPEAKER_12]: tell us what the conclusions are and could talk about like how long has this program been in existence so that if we were to look at some consolidation of like all of our after school capacity in the city, what, what is it, and what is the like unmet need and there is still significant unmet need, but it's a different amount of unmet need than it was several years ago.

462
01:46:20,398 --> 01:46:28,162
[SPEAKER_12]: In the collective so I feel like that would be really powerful information to to sort of get right and frame.

463
01:46:28,782 --> 01:46:33,205
[SPEAKER_12]: We're at for those parents who say we haven't made any progress because.

464
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:38,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I think even if you look at this, you might walk away and say, we haven't made any progress.

465
01:46:38,846 --> 01:46:40,706
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I don't think that's true.

466
01:46:41,987 --> 01:46:52,990
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think a slightly different look at this is something that would be powerful to keep on our website so that when people say things like that, we have a place we can point them to.

467
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:57,992
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing I would point out is that in the superintendent's email on a weekly basis,

468
01:46:58,992 --> 01:47:27,900
[SPEAKER_12]: um there is a list of job postings of things that we are positions that are open in the district and after school is not on the list um so it makes me wonder are we hiring for after school or are we not hiring for after school and if we're not hiring for after school why not um and maybe it just needs you know all the other positions are like just a hyperlink um maybe it needs like a few words about what that position is like how flexible it is

469
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:35,284
[SPEAKER_12]: what we're looking for, et cetera, so that you don't have to click into it and go into Frontline to find the job.

470
01:47:35,364 --> 01:47:46,089
[SPEAKER_12]: But certainly, it should be on the list, unless and until all of these waitlist issues are resolved, which I know is not a thing we can accomplish.

471
01:47:46,149 --> 01:47:55,855
[SPEAKER_12]: But we should certainly be looking for staff either to make sure you're not having to fill in or that we can do some targeted expansions here and there as people come online.

472
01:47:59,073 --> 01:48:08,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I clarify, when you said you're hearing from families that it hasn't gotten better, do you just mean the wait list or is there something else that needs to be better?

473
01:48:08,675 --> 01:48:13,536
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the unmet need is what people talk about, right?

474
01:48:13,596 --> 01:48:19,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I need something I can't have is the overarching thing.

475
01:48:19,237 --> 01:48:22,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I think people do talk about

476
01:48:23,405 --> 01:48:28,713
[SPEAKER_12]: wanting to understand the problem and is it getting better or worse.

477
01:48:28,773 --> 01:48:34,461
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do think there's some communication or some information that would be helpful on the website.

478
01:48:34,481 --> 01:48:38,067
[SPEAKER_12]: I did recently hear people talk about

479
01:48:40,262 --> 01:48:47,086
[SPEAKER_12]: our registration process being far less sophisticated than some of the private programs.

480
01:48:48,367 --> 01:48:56,352
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe there are some opportunities to work with our communications director and the website team to sort of shore up that process.

481
01:48:56,372 --> 01:48:58,814
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think there's lots of opportunities across

482
01:48:59,614 --> 01:49:25,754
[SPEAKER_12]: the the sort of spectrum of what is needed but I think the big thing that I hear consistently is the unmet need is still the unmet need and it's not improving and I don't think that's true um and I think this report says that but you have to sort of work at it to get to that explanation so maybe there's a way that our communications director can help put something on the website that like makes that a little bit more clear.

483
01:49:25,774 --> 01:49:28,536
[SPEAKER_10]: I think another thing worth noting is

484
01:49:31,543 --> 01:49:40,246
[SPEAKER_10]: what, we've talked about this before too, but what needing afterschool means, I think that definition has changed over time.

485
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:54,113
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would also be really hard to capture in these numbers because in the past, if there were parents home, in the home after school, then they wouldn't need afterschool.

486
01:49:55,313 --> 01:49:56,754
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't think that's still the case.

487
01:49:57,253 --> 01:50:12,899
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a lot of parents work from home and they need their kids to not be in the house so that they can work, or they feel like their kids can't be in the house so that they can work and concentrate, or they don't want their students to come home to nobody else to play with.

488
01:50:14,099 --> 01:50:23,723
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're thinking for socialization reasons, they would rather them be in afterschool, where I think several years or maybe just even five years ago, that wasn't necessarily the case.

489
01:50:23,763 --> 01:50:26,284
[SPEAKER_10]: That wouldn't have been defined as need afterschool.

490
01:50:27,236 --> 01:50:54,168
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's something that I don't know that we'd ever wanna get into the business of finding out, which is like how many houses are empty after school that a kid can't go home to an empty house, and somebody is gonna have to quit their job, versus ideally what they think is best for their child is to be in a socialized setting where they have other people to do their homework with, and it's not just going home by themselves, even though they have care.

491
01:50:55,464 --> 01:51:00,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, I think when I think of unmet need, it's people who are

492
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:08,934
[SPEAKER_12]: not in an afterschool program who believe that they need to be.

493
01:51:09,394 --> 01:51:15,680
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would challenge anybody who talks about working at home as like an opportunity to watch your kids.

494
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:18,282
[SPEAKER_12]: If you are working at home, you are working.

495
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:27,530
[SPEAKER_12]: And having kids at home is, if you wouldn't bring your kid to the office, we can't reasonably expect people to do that at home either.

496
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:28,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

497
01:51:29,312 --> 01:51:45,710
[SPEAKER_12]: And lots of companies have very strict and rigid rules around what must be in place in order to even allow that so I think if people are, to me, unmet need is, I'm trying to get into an after school program and I can't.

498
01:51:46,844 --> 01:51:53,570
[SPEAKER_12]: And for why you're trying to get into an afterschool program is not something I don't think we need to be particularly concerned about that.

499
01:51:56,752 --> 01:51:58,674
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I said, I think it has gotten better.

500
01:51:58,994 --> 01:52:03,177
[SPEAKER_12]: There's lots of programs on here that weren't here a year ago, two years ago, three years ago.

501
01:52:03,197 --> 01:52:08,602
[SPEAKER_12]: And they are taking 40, 30, 45 kids.

502
01:52:08,642 --> 01:52:12,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are all kids who were part of unmet need not that long ago.

503
01:52:13,926 --> 01:52:35,378
[SPEAKER_12]: who now have a place right and I think it's to me like what I'm envisioning for our communications director because I know he's here is something that combines all of these independent charts and provides a picture where you don't have to sort of work hard to like look at all the the the weedy details and you can know that

504
01:52:37,039 --> 01:52:41,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Our, the totality of our need is changing and it's increasing or decreasing or whatever.

505
01:52:42,344 --> 01:52:44,846
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that is what I would.

506
01:52:44,866 --> 01:52:53,134
[SPEAKER_12]: I think people would appreciate that because I think people try to understand what's going on and find it very difficult.

507
01:52:53,875 --> 01:52:58,260
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the end, we're not telling them information that makes them particularly happy.

508
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:11,956
[SPEAKER_12]: So serving it up in the sort of most cohesive way possible often is like a way around the fact that we're fundamentally giving people bad news when we're saying, no, I'm sorry, we don't have a space for your child in our program.

509
01:53:15,626 --> 01:53:16,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Graham.

510
01:53:16,646 --> 01:53:17,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

511
01:53:17,787 --> 01:53:18,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Fidelicari.

512
01:53:18,587 --> 01:53:21,068
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate the questions being answered.

513
01:53:22,749 --> 01:53:25,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three, we have the CTE Enrollment Report.

514
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:28,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Chad Fallon's patiently waiting.

515
01:53:28,331 --> 01:53:31,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Director of, Principal of the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

516
01:53:32,233 --> 01:53:32,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

517
01:53:34,994 --> 01:53:35,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this on?

518
01:53:35,714 --> 01:53:35,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

519
01:53:36,374 --> 01:53:41,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, Madam School Committee, Madam Superintendent, School Committee, Lisa, Jayden.

520
01:53:42,953 --> 01:53:44,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to share an update.

521
01:53:45,456 --> 01:53:50,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking listening to Megan's conversation waitlist is something not foreign to me.

522
01:53:51,482 --> 01:53:55,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to speak a little bit about that tonight with just a brief update and kind of where we're at.

523
01:53:58,010 --> 01:54:13,197
[SPEAKER_08]: We have seen over the last three years increased enrollment in such a way that is making us really look at the way we run our programs, the way we run our exploratory program, and to help get as many students in Medford into these programs as possible.

524
01:54:13,497 --> 01:54:15,998
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we still are left with a wait list.

525
01:54:16,478 --> 01:54:25,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's important to know that this is year three of a wait list of about 40 students each time, that when they choose their programs in grade nine, just about 40,

526
01:54:25,962 --> 01:54:27,303
[SPEAKER_08]: It starts off a little bit higher.

527
01:54:27,323 --> 01:54:33,988
[SPEAKER_08]: We're able to get it down to about 40 of students who don't get into their choice of programs.

528
01:54:35,129 --> 01:54:46,136
[SPEAKER_08]: What we have found is that in some programs, because the demand is higher than ever before, there are programs that really call for additional teachers.

529
01:54:46,677 --> 01:54:53,582
[SPEAKER_08]: One being auto technology, a second being culinary for auto tech and culinary would both be a third three teacher program.

530
01:54:54,338 --> 01:54:56,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And metal fabrication and welding needs a second teacher.

531
01:54:58,861 --> 01:55:03,023
[SPEAKER_08]: When we think about a new seven period schedule, it certainly allows for more opportunities.

532
01:55:03,083 --> 01:55:09,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we're closer than we've ever been before to looking at opportunities for all students within the building.

533
01:55:09,787 --> 01:55:17,091
[SPEAKER_08]: If, you know, for example, a third teacher in culinary gives us the opportunity to perhaps run an elective, something that all students could benefit from.

534
01:55:17,511 --> 01:55:22,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Similar to auto tech, I think all of us could use the skills that, you know, cooking and

535
01:55:23,374 --> 01:55:27,176
[SPEAKER_08]: being able to care for your car, and there's certain things that I think all students could benefit from.

536
01:55:27,536 --> 01:55:32,479
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think this becomes more of a reality than ever before when we look at this.

537
01:55:32,579 --> 01:55:35,480
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also important to mention that teacher recruitment is well underway.

538
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:42,204
[SPEAKER_08]: When I say that, we are faced with an interesting challenge that we know there's a skills gap.

539
01:55:42,264 --> 01:55:48,267
[SPEAKER_08]: We know there aren't enough trained individuals entering the workforce right now to enter the job market for these trades.

540
01:55:48,727 --> 01:55:51,670
[SPEAKER_08]: The average age of an electrician right now is 63 years old.

541
01:55:52,271 --> 01:56:04,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So while there's demand we don't have students that are filling the roles, as much as we'd like to but more importantly we don't have teachers that are willing to teach because it's a vast difference in pay, pay scale.

542
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:07,225
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are working with other schools.

543
01:56:07,245 --> 01:56:08,005
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not alone.

544
01:56:08,406 --> 01:56:11,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Every other vocational school in the state is feeling the burn.

545
01:56:11,408 --> 01:56:13,329
[SPEAKER_08]: There aren't enough people willing to teach.

546
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:15,631
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're all kind of putting our heads together.

547
01:56:15,651 --> 01:56:25,359
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what you're going to see in the next year or two is a lot of perhaps out-of-the-box ideas on how to have these students trained and companies that will hire them.

548
01:56:27,521 --> 01:56:34,965
[SPEAKER_08]: If I, there was a few, my mistake when I had sent this report, I made a mistake on a few of the programs.

549
01:56:35,005 --> 01:56:40,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to call out for the paper you have in front of you in terms of teaching staff biotechnology.

550
01:56:40,067 --> 01:56:43,689
[SPEAKER_08]: We have, it's really one full-time teacher and then a 0.5.

551
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:52,374
[SPEAKER_08]: 0.5 is because the teacher is already in the building teaching other sections of science, but because the biotech program is growing, this teacher also helps us with the sophomores.

552
01:56:53,474 --> 01:56:58,116
[SPEAKER_08]: The second issue was for graphic design.

553
01:56:58,196 --> 01:57:00,176
[SPEAKER_08]: We are now at one teacher.

554
01:57:00,977 --> 01:57:04,578
[SPEAKER_08]: And for film and TV, formerly known as media tech, we have two teachers.

555
01:57:04,658 --> 01:57:05,418
[SPEAKER_08]: That's nothing new.

556
01:57:06,119 --> 01:57:08,499
[SPEAKER_08]: That just was my mistake when I gave the report.

557
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:10,580
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see the numbers.

558
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the number to keep in mind is sophomore.

559
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:15,242
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the second year that we brought.

560
01:57:15,282 --> 01:57:16,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, we brought in about 172 sophomores.

561
01:57:19,901 --> 01:57:23,624
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're seeing is that less students are leaving, which is good.

562
01:57:24,365 --> 01:57:28,769
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you see the numbers for grade 11, we're still, we're holding at about 140 students.

563
01:57:29,269 --> 01:57:34,714
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have students that move out of district after grade 10, and we have students that just decided maybe isn't the right fit for them.

564
01:57:34,794 --> 01:57:36,836
[SPEAKER_08]: So they go to a more traditional high school schedule.

565
01:57:37,537 --> 01:57:46,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the number that we need to look at is the 423 students that we have grades 10 through 12 within the Medford High School campus that are accessing CTE.

566
01:57:47,361 --> 01:57:51,062
[SPEAKER_08]: So with the freshmen right now, there's 273 freshmen.

567
01:57:51,142 --> 01:57:58,784
[SPEAKER_08]: There's about 38 of them that are exploring an arts and technology rotation separate from CTE.

568
01:57:58,824 --> 01:58:06,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So 273 students that we anticipate anywhere from 150 to 180 to 190 are gonna want programming.

569
01:58:06,885 --> 01:58:08,966
[SPEAKER_08]: And essentially we're not gonna have seats for everybody.

570
01:58:10,418 --> 01:58:11,099
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not alone.

571
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:18,565
[SPEAKER_08]: There's 6,500 students statewide that are on wait lists for the 55 to 60 vocational schools in Massachusetts.

572
01:58:19,226 --> 01:58:24,610
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need to start being creative of how we can get these kids into seats because we certainly don't want anyone to go without.

573
01:58:25,411 --> 01:58:26,992
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've been creative.

574
01:58:27,833 --> 01:58:34,899
[SPEAKER_08]: We really try not to enroll kids after quarter one of sophomore year, but we make exceptions if a student moves out of district.

575
01:58:34,959 --> 01:58:38,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there's another student that has been on the wait list, we do our best to get them in.

576
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:44,403
[SPEAKER_08]: A few things just to mention, while I have an opportunity.

577
01:58:46,144 --> 01:58:58,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to share there's a few things that many things going on, but in our auto tech program right now we have three cars right now that are currently under our roof that will be partnering with second chance cars, this is our third year in a row, second chance cars is a 501 c three.

578
01:59:00,305 --> 01:59:04,708
[SPEAKER_08]: where they donate cars to disabled veterans or people that are re-entering the workforce.

579
01:59:05,708 --> 01:59:08,270
[SPEAKER_08]: This changes their lives drastically for obvious reasons.

580
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:15,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will work with this company out in Acton or Concord, right on the line, I believe.

581
01:59:16,035 --> 01:59:21,998
[SPEAKER_08]: We work with him, he'll provide us the car, we get the car in tip-top shape, and then we donate it to the person in need.

582
01:59:22,278 --> 01:59:24,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Our superintendents have been part of it a few times, it's pretty powerful.

583
01:59:26,048 --> 01:59:41,079
[SPEAKER_08]: As I go down the list I was sitting here, forgive me, but I just want to give some updates biotech I think it's important to know that for the first time ever Winchester High School called upon the biotechnology students at our school to deliver professional development to their teachers, which was a very cool moment for them.

584
01:59:42,837 --> 02:00:01,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Our carpentry program and I'm going to talk about carpentry and film and TV because on the same day I was at a construction mentoring program with six of our carpentry students that we were touring a job site Harvard University is building three new buildings and they took us on a tour we met with the construction company and the architects.

585
02:00:01,970 --> 02:00:14,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after that, we zipped across town and watched our film and TV students were one of three finalists for the Mass Department of Transportation's Safe Streets campaign, where they created a video on safe driving.

586
02:00:15,101 --> 02:00:16,522
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't know what our place would be.

587
02:00:16,642 --> 02:00:20,165
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were in the audience and we ended up coming up number two out of the state.

588
02:00:20,205 --> 02:00:26,790
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was three, there was a first place, a second place and a third place and the film and TV crew earned themselves a spot as number two.

589
02:00:28,918 --> 02:00:34,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Construction, just an update, if you're anywhere around the high school, you'll notice that some potholes have been filled in.

590
02:00:34,481 --> 02:00:45,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Construction Craft Laborers Program is working alongside the DPW to work on filling potholes and helping to keep the area more safe.

591
02:00:46,087 --> 02:00:49,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Culinary Program is killing it with Bistro 489.

592
02:00:49,049 --> 02:00:50,730
[SPEAKER_08]: If you haven't been in, I encourage you to do so.

593
02:00:50,810 --> 02:00:52,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Open for breakfast and lunch Tuesday through Friday.

594
02:00:54,710 --> 02:00:57,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I should mention the electrical department right now in our shop.

595
02:00:57,331 --> 02:01:08,496
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a collaboration between the electrical and metal fab program to, I don't know that I've actually seen them up, but there's some big Christmas bells that go, that get hung outside of city hall.

596
02:01:09,117 --> 02:01:17,400
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. Cormier has a cool story because he worked on it when he was a student and now his students so many years later are doing the same thing.

597
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:18,661
[SPEAKER_08]: So those will be installed soon.

598
02:01:20,353 --> 02:01:22,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Graphic design, a shout out to them.

599
02:01:22,494 --> 02:01:25,856
[SPEAKER_08]: They decorate our school with more than just posters.

600
02:01:26,116 --> 02:01:31,999
[SPEAKER_08]: We recently put above every doorway in the school building, our core values, respect, responsibility, empathy, and kindness.

601
02:01:33,379 --> 02:01:36,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Those students are doing amazing work beautifying the school.

602
02:01:37,421 --> 02:01:38,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Health assisting should be noted.

603
02:01:38,702 --> 02:01:47,126
[SPEAKER_08]: We now have six students at Winchester Hospital and 100% of the seniors in the health assisting program are out on co-op, which is paid work.

604
02:01:47,206 --> 02:01:49,007
[SPEAKER_08]: No one goes out on unpaid work in our program.

605
02:01:50,690 --> 02:01:54,071
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just kind of a quick update on where we are.

606
02:01:54,131 --> 02:01:55,811
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll leave you with this.

607
02:01:58,092 --> 02:02:06,993
[SPEAKER_08]: As we look, you'll be hearing some ideas from both myself and my colleagues as we look to the future of career tech enrollment in Medford.

608
02:02:08,594 --> 02:02:11,334
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of planning is underway with the new building, what that will look like.

609
02:02:11,374 --> 02:02:15,395
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been able to tour Waltham, Somerville,

610
02:02:17,098 --> 02:02:18,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And what was the other school we just toured?

611
02:02:18,962 --> 02:02:20,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I was with you all and I forget.

612
02:02:20,967 --> 02:02:21,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Arlington.

613
02:02:22,471 --> 02:02:23,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was another one too.

614
02:02:24,625 --> 02:02:28,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget, maybe that was just me.

615
02:02:28,967 --> 02:02:32,729
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have similar constraints, which is nice to hear.

616
02:02:33,089 --> 02:02:36,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Somerville is also in a situation where they have more students than they have seats.

617
02:02:37,291 --> 02:02:40,813
[SPEAKER_08]: But as we look to these other schools, we look at ways that we can increase capacity.

618
02:02:41,273 --> 02:02:48,017
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also going to be looking really closely at our exploratory program and seeing how we're offering this to students and helping students make the right decision.

619
02:02:49,237 --> 02:02:53,259
[SPEAKER_08]: In my world, the worst thing is a student who chooses career tech education.

620
02:02:54,969 --> 02:03:12,499
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't necessarily have a passion for it, I'm glad we get to offer it, but I worry about the kids who are on the wait list that might actually benefit from the trade as an electrician or as a construction supervisor or working in a restaurant.

621
02:03:12,979 --> 02:03:19,963
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to figure out really how we're marketing this to students when we start talking to them in seventh and eighth grade, what it means to be on a CareerTech pathway,

622
02:03:20,743 --> 02:03:25,524
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the most part, as of today, when I looked at the wait list, we were down to 32 students.

623
02:03:26,044 --> 02:03:27,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, now it's too late.

624
02:03:28,045 --> 02:03:37,146
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't enroll anybody in any programs now, but we do get that wait list down, but we do need to start thinking about what it may look like in grade eight when students apply.

625
02:03:37,166 --> 02:03:45,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I say apply, they don't technically apply, but we may need to be looking at other options to make it an equitable process for all students.

626
02:03:48,609 --> 02:03:49,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Principal Phelan.

627
02:03:51,411 --> 02:03:52,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

628
02:03:53,432 --> 02:03:59,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you following the state level conversations around vocational school admissions?

629
02:03:59,714 --> 02:04:00,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

630
02:04:00,534 --> 02:04:02,135
[SPEAKER_12]: I know they've gotten heated.

631
02:04:02,295 --> 02:04:16,340
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't been as plugged into them, but I think that the general story is that vocational school enrollment has become so competitive that they are no longer equitable.

632
02:04:17,714 --> 02:04:21,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the general story?

633
02:04:21,978 --> 02:04:27,783
[SPEAKER_08]: For years, when vocational schools were under enrolled, people didn't seem to pay too much attention to the admissions policies.

634
02:04:27,883 --> 02:04:32,147
[SPEAKER_08]: And now that it's flipped, everyone is looking at the admissions policies.

635
02:04:32,948 --> 02:04:41,296
[SPEAKER_08]: For the most part, you'll see for vocational schools, and we have a similar policy that we lean on, but we don't have to use because you don't have to apply to come to my school anymore.

636
02:04:41,336 --> 02:04:42,137
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit different.

637
02:04:43,069 --> 02:04:51,158
[SPEAKER_08]: But they were typically looking at grades attendance and discipline, and a lot of schools came under fire about that because you know if you're a seventh grader and you have a mishap.

638
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:56,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Why should that really follow you into high school if you have one, you know, disciplinary action.

639
02:04:58,166 --> 02:05:10,934
[SPEAKER_08]: The state, a lot of proponents of the change would like to see a lottery based system and there's people on both sides of that so you know we're in an interesting position because we don't have to worry about.

640
02:05:11,674 --> 02:05:19,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Applications per se, but I do think we're closer to looking at what we may do in our own admissions criteria but yeah a lot of schools are under fire for this.

641
02:05:21,091 --> 02:05:28,759
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I would also like to see there be like radically improved communication to ninth grade parents.

642
02:05:29,634 --> 02:05:37,741
[SPEAKER_12]: in that transition from the rotational exploratory program to like, you're making a choice for the next three years of high school.

643
02:05:37,781 --> 02:05:41,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Like that came and went with like a lot of confusion last year.

644
02:05:41,924 --> 02:05:43,926
[SPEAKER_12]: And my daughter was in that grade.

645
02:05:43,966 --> 02:05:47,528
[SPEAKER_12]: So I heard from a lot of parents who were like, I don't even know what's happening.

646
02:05:47,588 --> 02:05:49,330
[SPEAKER_12]: My kid is picking something.

647
02:05:49,390 --> 02:05:52,993
[SPEAKER_12]: I had people be like, my kid is picking something I think is like a really terrible choice for them.

648
02:05:53,053 --> 02:05:54,154
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what to do about it.

649
02:05:54,854 --> 02:05:57,677
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think parents just like very much felt

650
02:05:58,457 --> 02:06:05,379
[SPEAKER_12]: left out of that conversation in a way that was hard, I think was challenging.

651
02:06:06,499 --> 02:06:09,900
[SPEAKER_12]: And to your point about taking a spot away, I get it.

652
02:06:10,340 --> 02:06:18,982
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, they're in ninth grade, and they don't know what they want and what they don't want.

653
02:06:19,022 --> 02:06:24,903
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I don't know how you overcome that except to open the lines of communication.

654
02:06:24,963 --> 02:06:27,604
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's important to really think about.

655
02:06:28,417 --> 02:06:46,443
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe think about like is it forever if you go in at in that like maybe are there two decision points like one in the last part of ninth grade and another at the end of ninth grade so that there is an opening or something in 10th grade if kids try try it out and decide it's really not for them.

656
02:06:48,311 --> 02:06:52,534
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, I just, the communication was a real missed opportunity last year for sure.

657
02:06:52,594 --> 02:06:59,119
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just had a front row seat because my daughter was like in that loop and actually like picked a program.

658
02:06:59,279 --> 02:07:01,861
[SPEAKER_12]: She went to school that day and I was like, I don't know what she's gonna do.

659
02:07:01,881 --> 02:07:04,863
[SPEAKER_12]: And when she came home, we're like, what did you decide?

660
02:07:05,924 --> 02:07:13,849
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was very much, you know, she was fine to do it on her own and we were really happy that she did.

661
02:07:14,770 --> 02:07:17,231
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think every kid is in that situation.

662
02:07:17,471 --> 02:07:20,092
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think there's a lot of parents who had a lot of questions.

663
02:07:20,893 --> 02:07:27,156
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think one of the big questions is always like, what does it mean to be in a vocational program?

664
02:07:27,316 --> 02:07:29,797
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not the same in every vocational program, right?

665
02:07:30,526 --> 02:07:46,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Where are you going, if you are in x vocational program versus why and those answers are very very different in the programming that we have and they also are nothing like being in a vocational program when we were kids right so I don't think we've ever like really unlocked.

666
02:07:47,932 --> 02:07:50,993
[SPEAKER_12]: describing that to parents in a way that resonates.

667
02:07:51,194 --> 02:07:54,755
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I've heard you say lots of times, it's not like it used to be.

668
02:07:55,216 --> 02:07:57,957
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think people are like, oh, cool, but what does that mean?

669
02:07:58,557 --> 02:08:08,582
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do think there's still some work to do to educate the parents in this conversation about what it means for them academically.

670
02:08:08,722 --> 02:08:16,586
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't have inserted myself, but it was not clear to me last year that my daughter was now gonna take

671
02:08:18,658 --> 02:08:20,199
[SPEAKER_12]: online Spanish, for example.

672
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:26,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I think I conceptually knew that, but because I sit here, not because I was like sort of informed of that as a parent.

673
02:08:26,603 --> 02:08:33,566
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just think there's a lot of academic pieces of the puzzle that are not as easy to put together on your own.

674
02:08:34,267 --> 02:08:44,032
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know if maybe just like informational Zoom would help or something would help parents feel better about navigating that transition.

675
02:08:45,285 --> 02:08:46,666
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's totally fair.

676
02:08:47,667 --> 02:08:59,815
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I did this year that's different is that we're ending exploratory at the end of quarter two to give additional time so that instead of going through three quarters and only giving students a quarter to experience it, now they have two quarters.

677
02:09:00,636 --> 02:09:02,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear you with the communication.

678
02:09:02,897 --> 02:09:08,982
[SPEAKER_08]: From my seat, I feel as though I'm communicating because I'm doing a lot of talking points and things like that.

679
02:09:09,022 --> 02:09:09,542
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're right.

680
02:09:09,562 --> 02:09:13,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I think because of the shift in vocab and what it looks like now,

681
02:09:14,145 --> 02:09:19,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I do need to do a better job having some better community forum, if you will, or parents to understand.

682
02:09:20,408 --> 02:09:22,769
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I think even though, you know, this is my eighth year.

683
02:09:22,809 --> 02:09:25,591
[SPEAKER_08]: When I came in, it was the first year of no more application.

684
02:09:26,011 --> 02:09:33,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, you know, we're still trying to figure out what did that look like eight years ago when we were under enrolled as opposed to now.

685
02:09:34,755 --> 02:09:38,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I would almost rather an application sometimes because then at least I would have something to work with.

686
02:09:39,578 --> 02:09:41,479
[SPEAKER_08]: My biggest pain

687
02:09:43,217 --> 02:09:53,799
[SPEAKER_08]: in Medford, which it's a great problem to have, to have all these kids, but any other vocational school you would go to, you would apply and you wouldn't step foot into the building unless you were accepted.

688
02:09:54,279 --> 02:10:02,621
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have this internal struggle all the time where I'm like, here we are saying to freshmen, come one, come all, but 40 of you will never make it because we just don't have seats.

689
02:10:03,141 --> 02:10:04,101
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm with you.

690
02:10:04,121 --> 02:10:05,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's two problems.

691
02:10:05,761 --> 02:10:07,042
[SPEAKER_08]: One being that we have to solve the,

692
02:10:09,056 --> 02:10:13,818
[SPEAKER_08]: know the enrollment issue, and to just better share with parents because I hear you.

693
02:10:14,158 --> 02:10:15,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I do hear you on that.

694
02:10:15,718 --> 02:10:18,499
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I guess the other thing I would encourage you to think about.

695
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:30,023
[SPEAKER_12]: We, we outlined a series of expanded programs in our MSBA application that we worked on back in May, June.

696
02:10:31,246 --> 02:10:42,069
[SPEAKER_12]: And we actually did lay out some level of programming that didn't need to wait for a new building and others that did like others that were like completely space constrained and we could not move forward on.

697
02:10:43,149 --> 02:10:54,712
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason I bring that up is because, with a successful passage of seven question seven and question eight question eight in particular talks specifically about expanded programming.

698
02:10:55,459 --> 02:11:14,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a resolution on the agenda in just a little bit to talk about a supplemental budget in this fiscal year that would be able to spend the money that has been agreed to by the city or by the voters, I guess I would say.

699
02:11:14,755 --> 02:11:20,719
[SPEAKER_12]: And there just may be an opening there for you to think about like, is there something we can do

700
02:11:21,678 --> 02:11:39,939
[SPEAKER_12]: in the short term, whether it's like expanding a program with an additional teacher, and just make sure that Mr. McHugh has that information so when he's putting together the supplemental budget package that we're going to ask for, that if there are particular things that are vocational in nature, that they can be at the table as well.

701
02:11:40,657 --> 02:11:41,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect timing.

702
02:11:41,317 --> 02:11:43,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I already had my budget meeting and he him and Noel are well aware.

703
02:11:45,478 --> 02:11:56,221
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is like a, you know, we'll talk about this in just a minute, but there is like a near term aspect of that money as well.

704
02:11:56,301 --> 02:11:58,602
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not waiting until next fiscal year.

705
02:11:58,622 --> 02:11:59,542
[SPEAKER_12]: So great.

706
02:11:59,942 --> 02:12:00,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, good to know.

707
02:12:00,843 --> 02:12:01,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

708
02:12:01,523 --> 02:12:03,263
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

709
02:12:04,024 --> 02:12:05,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Brindley.

710
02:12:07,726 --> 02:12:09,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a whole bunch of notes because I'm a big fan.

711
02:12:10,067 --> 02:12:16,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am honored enough to be on the advisory board for the vocational school through the culinary program through my daughter.

712
02:12:17,689 --> 02:12:21,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had a meeting last week, the first one of this school year.

713
02:12:22,411 --> 02:12:24,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe there was 120 in attendance.

714
02:12:25,412 --> 02:12:27,613
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't a seat at the bistro to be had.

715
02:12:27,673 --> 02:12:37,056
[SPEAKER_04]: We were looking for seats for which were together were parents, business owners in the community, staff members and students.

716
02:12:37,595 --> 02:12:45,158
[SPEAKER_04]: And to look around that room and to see how much like really love was in the room was really overwhelming to me.

717
02:12:45,758 --> 02:12:52,220
[SPEAKER_04]: For the culinary program, there was the executive chef for Earl's Kitchen, the owner of Goldilocks Bagels.

718
02:12:53,300 --> 02:13:02,623
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an owner of, I can't remember all the things this gentleman did, but he was a friend of Chef C and he owned food trucks.

719
02:13:03,444 --> 02:13:06,485
[SPEAKER_04]: But these people came out to, you know, listen to

720
02:13:07,495 --> 02:13:12,201
[SPEAKER_04]: The students talk and show around the bistro and it was very impressive.

721
02:13:12,702 --> 02:13:19,370
[SPEAKER_04]: You also gave out an award, and I believe it was the first award so I just want to know if you could tell everybody about that because I thought that was really cool.

722
02:13:20,231 --> 02:13:20,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, we.

723
02:13:23,289 --> 02:13:38,135
[SPEAKER_08]: One of our long term well for about five or six years now Asher Nichols owns remodeling and construction business and he went when a few teachers and I talked about who do we want to recognize this year as an employer partner, he was the first one that came to mind so.

724
02:13:39,295 --> 02:13:49,846
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like all good ideas it was a little bit last minute of mine so I called on my friends down in engineering and I was like hey can you make me a plaque and of course they exceeded my expectations and carpentry got involved and it was pretty cool.

725
02:13:50,226 --> 02:13:58,134
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we awarded this to an employee partner, an employee partner to thank them for taking a risk I mean when you hire 16, 17, 18 year olds.

726
02:14:00,476 --> 02:14:03,777
[SPEAKER_08]: you're taking a risk as a business owner and he's done it continuously.

727
02:14:03,877 --> 02:14:17,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's something we're going to do from now on every year at our fall advisory dinner is honor one of our partners, because it's important to give a shout out to them because it's, you know, there's these, these kids are still learning and they're willing to take them on.

728
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:18,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

729
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:29,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's amazing how many business owners were at that meeting that, that night and whether they're in the community or, you know, in the area and it, that group,

730
02:14:29,833 --> 02:14:36,019
[SPEAKER_04]: got up and I believe there was one already graduate from Medford High and one student from Medford High that was working with them.

731
02:14:36,179 --> 02:14:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think it's really nice to recognize them to say like, you are taking this risk and we appreciate you.

732
02:14:43,125 --> 02:14:48,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were just so many business owners there and so many people that you recognize from in the community that you're like, oh, she's a hairdresser.

733
02:14:49,070 --> 02:14:54,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know her from the elementary school or the local daycare.

734
02:14:54,355 --> 02:14:55,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just really,

735
02:14:56,016 --> 02:14:58,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really a nice night.

736
02:14:58,278 --> 02:14:59,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think more people need to know about it.

737
02:14:59,939 --> 02:15:05,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you aren't a vocational parent, you wouldn't know that that's on the schedule.

738
02:15:06,424 --> 02:15:09,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a few things that I think about in my spare time.

739
02:15:11,828 --> 02:15:18,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's still a myth about the vocational school that I graduated Medford High 30 years ago.

740
02:15:18,754 --> 02:15:20,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to my reunion at the end of the month.

741
02:15:20,935 --> 02:15:25,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And you really went to the Vogue if there wasn't a great path for you academically.

742
02:15:26,636 --> 02:15:32,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there is this myth that parents still say, Oh no, I want my daughter to go to college.

743
02:15:32,540 --> 02:15:34,121
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's not, she's not going to go to the Vogue.

744
02:15:34,582 --> 02:15:37,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think maybe that's what member Graham was sort of mentioning.

745
02:15:37,164 --> 02:15:51,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there are so many paths that include, you know, academics that I think that that is lost on some of, I don't know, I don't want to say the world, but definitely not just metric specific that

746
02:15:53,550 --> 02:15:56,411
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to the Vogue, and you are going to college.

747
02:15:56,651 --> 02:16:06,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just, you know, some of the programs are certainly more towards getting into a union or whatever, but I think that so many of them are also geared towards going to college.

748
02:16:07,354 --> 02:16:12,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think bridging that gap between the high school and the Vogue is so imperative because

749
02:16:13,325 --> 02:16:15,246
[SPEAKER_04]: We do need kids to take language still.

750
02:16:15,326 --> 02:16:17,687
[SPEAKER_04]: We still need kids to explore other options.

751
02:16:17,727 --> 02:16:24,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And so obviously that's not just on you, of course, but just something that I think that we need to be aware of, that we need to get the word out.

752
02:16:26,791 --> 02:16:33,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also am wondering, you do have to keep up your academics, correct, to stay in your shop.

753
02:16:34,580 --> 02:16:34,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

754
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:35,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

755
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:42,363
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that people just feel like if you're there, it's because you are not excelling in academics, but it's actually the opposite.

756
02:16:42,383 --> 02:16:44,224
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to keep up your academics.

757
02:16:44,944 --> 02:16:52,867
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, that's why you'll see a little dip in the numbers junior year, because unfortunately, some kids don't make it over the summer, you have to pass your academic core courses.

758
02:16:52,927 --> 02:16:55,148
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't, you have to fulfill them during summer school.

759
02:16:55,328 --> 02:16:57,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of them might not do that.

760
02:16:57,869 --> 02:16:58,009
[SPEAKER_08]: So

761
02:16:59,090 --> 02:17:05,195
[SPEAKER_08]: their high school schedule will be changed to make up for the courses that they're deficient in, but then there's no room for CTE.

762
02:17:05,535 --> 02:17:06,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

763
02:17:07,417 --> 02:17:12,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know if students' attendance on a day-to-day basis is higher if you're in the vocational program?

764
02:17:14,043 --> 02:17:15,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have that in front of me.

765
02:17:15,084 --> 02:17:16,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Just curious about that.

766
02:17:16,845 --> 02:17:22,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm always impressed that the academic teachers, and I noticed it a lot this year at curriculum night,

767
02:17:24,255 --> 02:17:29,661
[SPEAKER_04]: how supportive the staff is to the vocational students, and I think it's really nice.

768
02:17:30,121 --> 02:17:41,653
[SPEAKER_04]: They know that obviously the academics are priority, but they're talking about these students that are, they know that they're out at work, that they're doing co-op, that they're trying to tailor their teaching style to

769
02:17:43,666 --> 02:17:45,606
[SPEAKER_04]: really incorporate what these kids love.

770
02:17:46,226 --> 02:17:58,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that was so great to see in science and math and English, you know, these different academics that they want these kids to excel and still really be, you know, workers in the community.

771
02:17:59,309 --> 02:18:07,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that was like a nice thing that I hear every year that the staff says, you know, like how important they know the voc is to these kids.

772
02:18:08,910 --> 02:18:12,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone also mentioned to me how they feel like the behaviors of the vocationals

773
02:18:13,609 --> 02:18:20,074
[SPEAKER_04]: school students is better because they're busy.

774
02:18:21,075 --> 02:18:21,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Their hands are busy.

775
02:18:22,836 --> 02:18:23,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Their minds are busy.

776
02:18:23,837 --> 02:18:27,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And I even know in my house that there's never a question about wanting to go to school.

777
02:18:28,393 --> 02:18:30,274
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's never a question about that.

778
02:18:30,334 --> 02:18:32,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I can't, I can't miss it.

779
02:18:32,334 --> 02:18:33,635
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can't miss it.

780
02:18:33,835 --> 02:18:34,535
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's this day.

781
02:18:34,555 --> 02:18:38,276
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, my daughter chopped 30 pounds of onions today in goggles.

782
02:18:41,017 --> 02:18:41,557
[SPEAKER_04]: She's never done.

783
02:18:42,037 --> 02:18:42,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

784
02:18:42,517 --> 02:18:43,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you see the picture?

785
02:18:43,638 --> 02:18:54,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't show it publicly, but it was, it's awesome that, you know, there was no complaint.

786
02:18:54,718 --> 02:18:57,061
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, she came home and she's like, I gotta get my shower smell like onions.

787
02:18:57,081 --> 02:18:57,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay.

788
02:18:59,163 --> 02:19:06,952
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but I think that they do things that are so out of the element, but because they love their shop, they want to, they want to do it.

789
02:19:07,193 --> 02:19:10,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's such a great incentive to come to school every day.

790
02:19:10,937 --> 02:19:12,559
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, never wanting to be late.

791
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:14,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that is

792
02:19:15,560 --> 02:19:20,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I would think going to school to chop onions is more exciting than going to school to do math.

793
02:19:20,804 --> 02:19:25,887
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the day-to-day basis, I think these kids are coming to school because they love what they're doing.

794
02:19:25,967 --> 02:19:27,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that is great.

795
02:19:27,108 --> 02:19:30,430
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just want to compliment you on that and the staff at the Vogue, obviously.

796
02:19:31,651 --> 02:19:32,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me think.

797
02:19:32,151 --> 02:19:32,572
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

798
02:19:33,592 --> 02:19:43,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to congratulate you, too, because you mentioned in the meeting the other day that not only are you the director and obviously the principal of a vocational school, but you're also managing 15

799
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:45,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct?

800
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:46,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

801
02:19:46,380 --> 02:19:46,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Businesses.

802
02:19:48,481 --> 02:19:49,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Never a dull moment.

803
02:19:49,961 --> 02:19:50,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

804
02:19:50,381 --> 02:19:51,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

805
02:19:51,201 --> 02:19:51,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

806
02:19:52,482 --> 02:19:55,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to manage my house and it's a lot some days, right?

807
02:19:56,262 --> 02:20:05,965
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I know Memogram mentioned it, but what is your ultimate vision for a new Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School?

808
02:20:07,085 --> 02:20:07,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh boy.

809
02:20:08,220 --> 02:20:09,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get my blueprints.

810
02:20:09,321 --> 02:20:09,701
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just kidding.

811
02:20:09,901 --> 02:20:11,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you send it to us, please?

812
02:20:12,262 --> 02:20:18,206
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, seeing the other schools has been helpful because I've seen what I like and what I don't know that I love.

813
02:20:18,806 --> 02:20:25,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And the whole MSBA process has, I'm assuming that we probably have a lot less

814
02:20:26,710 --> 02:20:28,070
[SPEAKER_08]: input than I thought we would.

815
02:20:28,190 --> 02:20:28,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a good thing.

816
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:30,191
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to be here forever.

817
02:20:30,351 --> 02:20:32,231
[SPEAKER_08]: We're building a school for 50, 60 years.

818
02:20:32,291 --> 02:20:36,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I look at other programs, I'm picking up what I think would work for us and what doesn't.

819
02:20:36,372 --> 02:20:40,773
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm also being realistic, thinking when we sit down with these architects, they probably have an idea.

820
02:20:40,793 --> 02:20:43,673
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going to probably welcome our suggestions.

821
02:20:43,713 --> 02:20:45,933
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end of the day, we may not get everything we want.

822
02:20:45,994 --> 02:20:49,674
[SPEAKER_08]: So I definitely have a list of things that I know are like non-negotiables.

823
02:20:49,694 --> 02:20:50,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what we know works.

824
02:20:51,094 --> 02:20:52,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what works for Medford.

825
02:20:52,195 --> 02:20:52,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what we need.

826
02:20:54,830 --> 02:21:09,416
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a really cool time to be an educator in Medford right now because it's getting closer and, you know, two years ago seven years away and now maybe it's five years away or four it so it's it's a fun time to be here, because we can kind of see the finish line.

827
02:21:12,466 --> 02:21:27,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, you know, thinking of what Miss Graham said it, it really, I get wrapped up in the work sometimes so I forget to promote we don't do enough of that so I think the communication and the promoting is important, because there is so much going on on a day to day basis

828
02:21:28,417 --> 02:21:43,139
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's a little different for me I'm the only CTE administrator in Medford so I have to, you know, call on my colleagues which are always willing to help but it is a different lens to work through and I do have to remind people sometimes I'm like yeah well,

829
02:21:43,759 --> 02:21:55,665
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we have a repair plate in the auto tech shop that's under my name I'm the repair shop owner, so it's funny when you think about it for me it's great because I get you know all these different things but apply for a lot of different jobs.

830
02:21:57,826 --> 02:22:04,710
[SPEAKER_08]: But what you said is true, there is definitely great things happening at the high school and.

831
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:10,572
[SPEAKER_08]: The programs I oversee are fantastic and the teachers come to work every day.

832
02:22:10,653 --> 02:22:15,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that your staff is so engaged and I love how they collaborate with each other.

833
02:22:15,595 --> 02:22:17,176
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me so happy.

834
02:22:17,196 --> 02:22:26,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I remember coming to look at the book last year and going into biotech and feeling like I was in a different world.

835
02:22:27,481 --> 02:22:28,661
[SPEAKER_04]: They were amazing.

836
02:22:29,101 --> 02:22:30,282
[SPEAKER_04]: They were amazing in biotech.

837
02:22:30,582 --> 02:22:34,664
[SPEAKER_04]: And I loved how last year they, I hope I say this right,

838
02:22:35,146 --> 02:22:49,389
[SPEAKER_04]: biotech was taking the oil from culinary and changing it into glycerin and then also taking some to make the gasoline or the diesel for the, right?

839
02:22:49,449 --> 02:22:49,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right?

840
02:22:49,849 --> 02:22:50,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I on track there?

841
02:22:50,769 --> 02:22:53,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was something to do with, yeah, with the welding shop.

842
02:22:54,110 --> 02:22:56,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, this is so cool that they're all working together.

843
02:22:57,010 --> 02:23:02,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool until the welding shop decides to fire it up on a Monday morning and there's smoke billowing in the hallway.

844
02:23:02,872 --> 02:23:04,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're like, oh, that's us again, sorry.

845
02:23:05,566 --> 02:23:07,893
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a shop to take care of that part.

846
02:23:08,515 --> 02:23:09,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

847
02:23:09,899 --> 02:23:11,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing all I can to promote

848
02:23:11,926 --> 02:23:12,987
[SPEAKER_04]: the culinary program.

849
02:23:13,367 --> 02:23:20,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody sees all my delicious food that gets taken back to some of the public schools, or that I'm having for lunch or taking home for dinner.

850
02:23:21,012 --> 02:23:21,652
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's great.

851
02:23:21,712 --> 02:23:22,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so affordable.

852
02:23:22,853 --> 02:23:32,619
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that people don't realize how affordable I mean, I walk out of there with $40 worth of food, but I'm feeding the Somerville special ed office, I'm having lunch for the rest of the week.

853
02:23:32,799 --> 02:23:35,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I just found out Somerville doesn't open their restaurant to the public.

854
02:23:36,596 --> 02:23:37,216
[SPEAKER_08]: in their culinary program.

855
02:23:37,236 --> 02:23:38,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe they do.

856
02:23:38,297 --> 02:23:39,298
[SPEAKER_04]: We get a lot of emails.

857
02:23:39,798 --> 02:23:42,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Pantidose is the CTE director over there.

858
02:23:42,901 --> 02:23:46,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Their menu looks great too, but a little partial over here.

859
02:23:46,563 --> 02:23:48,185
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it's awesome, so thank you.

860
02:23:48,205 --> 02:23:49,746
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to talk about the vocal?

861
02:23:49,766 --> 02:23:50,666
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, we totally do.

862
02:23:50,686 --> 02:23:51,487
[SPEAKER_06]: We totally do.

863
02:23:51,667 --> 02:23:52,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

864
02:23:52,127 --> 02:23:52,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

865
02:23:52,468 --> 02:23:52,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

866
02:23:52,808 --> 02:23:55,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a few more people have questions, but thank you.

867
02:23:55,930 --> 02:23:56,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

868
02:23:56,851 --> 02:23:59,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Reinfeld, then Member Intoppa.

869
02:24:00,453 --> 02:24:25,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say so they covered some of my, my question about the expanded program but I just want to say as you're thinking about the new schedule and the new pathways to definitely I just want to say publicly to make sure to talk with our arts department because I know they have a lot of ideas and are facing kind of that opposite challenge of under enrollment because of scheduling and the opportunity so I would love to see that proposal come to us as a coherent.

870
02:24:26,699 --> 02:24:28,080
[SPEAKER_11]: You said lots of out-of-the-box thinking.

871
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:30,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they're already working on ideas there as well.

872
02:24:31,302 --> 02:24:32,382
[SPEAKER_08]: We're part of a team together.

873
02:24:32,402 --> 02:24:41,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, and so I'm excited to see what's coming there because I think it is multiple sides of probably dice, not coins, to torture a metaphor.

874
02:24:42,228 --> 02:24:42,548
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

875
02:24:43,009 --> 02:24:43,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

876
02:24:43,949 --> 02:24:44,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Intapa.

877
02:24:45,370 --> 02:24:46,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, in

878
02:24:47,481 --> 02:24:51,842
[SPEAKER_07]: in that same vein as we were talking about, about, you know, the arts department, how do we work with them?

879
02:24:52,682 --> 02:25:03,865
[SPEAKER_07]: My point was actually going to be about the graphic design department who I've had the fortunate ability to work with as a student in doing stuff with the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

880
02:25:04,425 --> 02:25:09,567
[SPEAKER_07]: But this may not be a, maybe not a topic for tonight, but the question of,

881
02:25:11,132 --> 02:25:21,436
[SPEAKER_07]: we're seeing enrollment in the graphic design department and possibly helping alleviate that sort of wait list, you know, if we can get more people into the graphic design department.

882
02:25:22,056 --> 02:25:25,278
[SPEAKER_07]: As you know, we have two educators in there, making sure we're not overwhelming them.

883
02:25:25,338 --> 02:25:35,682
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know that in my time as a student at MassArt, I was a design major, but I was not in the

884
02:25:36,055 --> 02:25:41,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Graphic design department, but they switched from graphic design to calm design communication design and doing so.

885
02:25:43,278 --> 02:25:46,679
[SPEAKER_07]: brought a bit more of opportunity for their students, mainly our.

886
02:25:49,793 --> 02:25:54,878
[SPEAKER_07]: students who are from other countries, because that helps with visas.

887
02:25:55,379 --> 02:26:02,025
[SPEAKER_07]: By changing it to com design and by changing some of the GL class identifications, it actually makes it part of STEM in some way.

888
02:26:02,506 --> 02:26:10,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So that may open us up to some other grant opportunities, whether that be a future educator who's a visiting artist or maybe a part-time employee

889
02:26:11,269 --> 02:26:13,652
[SPEAKER_07]: but also to upgrade what we have as a shop.

890
02:26:14,893 --> 02:26:32,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So that discussion of possibly, and when you change the comm design is more, I guess, theory based and it is more, you know, a lot of the education is more surrounding the whys and strategy which when folks go if they choose to go to places like MassArt or other higher education institutions,

891
02:26:33,151 --> 02:26:44,314
[SPEAKER_07]: It almost better serves them if they are getting that communication design, which is still very similar graphic design education, but it almost gears them up more for that thing.

892
02:26:44,334 --> 02:26:48,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I know like, you know, it's one of the smallest here, but at SR it's the largest department.

893
02:26:49,675 --> 02:26:56,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think people fully realize the benefits to a graphic designer communication design education.

894
02:26:57,726 --> 02:27:00,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think people view it too much as an art thing.

895
02:27:00,387 --> 02:27:04,529
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know some institutions, it's almost looked down upon in their vocational schools.

896
02:27:04,569 --> 02:27:10,211
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel like the opportunities are very, I mean, you can't go anywhere without a graphic designer.

897
02:27:11,071 --> 02:27:11,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's hiring them.

898
02:27:12,332 --> 02:27:15,733
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually sunsetting the graphic communications frameworks.

899
02:27:15,793 --> 02:27:19,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And everyone's going to be under the new frameworks, which are design and visual communications.

900
02:27:20,035 --> 02:27:21,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think what you're saying speaks to that.

901
02:27:21,856 --> 02:27:22,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

902
02:27:22,516 --> 02:27:24,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you'll grab a different population.

903
02:27:25,297 --> 02:27:25,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

904
02:27:26,158 --> 02:27:26,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

905
02:27:26,738 --> 02:27:26,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

906
02:27:27,895 --> 02:27:28,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

907
02:27:28,495 --> 02:27:31,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Fallon, we appreciate being here.

908
02:27:32,576 --> 02:27:40,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we go on to number four I want to just recognize our student representative Jaden Bill, thank you for joining us you've been here a while, I'm sorry I didn't recognize you sooner.

909
02:27:41,099 --> 02:27:47,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up we have our draft fiscal year 26 budget calendar, Mr. Gerald McHugh budget analyst.

910
02:28:00,424 --> 02:28:01,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

911
02:28:01,364 --> 02:28:09,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently completed a draft of our budget calendar.

912
02:28:09,906 --> 02:28:20,769
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also reviewed the policy and procedure document that school committee passed last year for budget development.

913
02:28:20,849 --> 02:28:27,931
[SPEAKER_00]: So I attempted to align the calendar with that document as well.

914
02:28:30,214 --> 02:28:53,192
[SPEAKER_00]: In going through it, I am respectfully requesting that some minor changes to the procedures document be enacted so we can get a little bit more time at the beginning of the process to pull all the budget information together.

915
02:28:54,404 --> 02:29:03,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now, you know, that would have to be pretty much completed, I think, by the beginning, uh, by the end of January.

916
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:19,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what I'm suggesting is that we use January and February for that, uh, budget development and then use the month of March to adopt the budget, have the public hearings, um,

917
02:29:20,891 --> 02:29:28,403
[SPEAKER_00]: and then present it to the mayor in April, which is

918
02:29:30,519 --> 02:29:39,364
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a good, a good date, good early date to get the budget to the city and to begin to advocate with the city for its passage.

919
02:29:39,384 --> 02:29:53,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I also provided some time, uh, on a TBD basis for committee of the home meetings that, um, we would want to take place, uh, in, uh, February and March.

920
02:29:57,239 --> 02:30:01,462
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is certainly something that doesn't have to be approved tonight.

921
02:30:01,702 --> 02:30:07,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're loosely moving forward based on the draft schedule.

922
02:30:07,567 --> 02:30:20,016
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's specific items you would like to address, there's certainly time to incorporate that into the document.

923
02:30:25,575 --> 02:30:28,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. McHugh.

924
02:30:29,337 --> 02:30:32,698
[SPEAKER_06]: You have it outlined in the six page document you gave us.

925
02:30:33,178 --> 02:30:35,199
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay.

926
02:30:36,079 --> 02:30:38,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And nobody has any questions if everybody could review this.

927
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:43,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau, and then Member Reinfeld.

928
02:30:44,262 --> 02:30:44,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

929
02:30:46,873 --> 02:30:52,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm perfectly comfortable, I mean, with us discussing the timeline from our policy.

930
02:30:53,779 --> 02:31:01,085
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first year with the policy, so I think we all kind of assumed it would not work exactly.

931
02:31:02,426 --> 02:31:12,175
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing, though, is that part of the policy is to align with the capital improvement plan

932
02:31:14,298 --> 02:31:25,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to just dig into it really quickly right now, because one of the challenges we had was that we had a date that we needed to make sure aligned with the city's budget ordinance.

933
02:31:27,788 --> 02:31:41,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't tell necessarily from this document whether we're going to blow past their date, because those conversations were back in June, and frankly, it feels like five years ago already.

934
02:31:44,116 --> 02:32:02,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we do, I can go and back and try and figure out what after look at the minutes but there was an important date here that required a lot of pushing things earlier than I think even we had initially thought we wanted, because we knew this is a very aggressive timeline change.

935
02:32:03,666 --> 02:32:06,969
[SPEAKER_01]: the budget ordinance has a date, which I don't have in front of me.

936
02:32:07,650 --> 02:32:13,456
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't want to miss that because then it makes that a problem.

937
02:32:13,496 --> 02:32:16,499
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not giving you enough information to go on right this second.

938
02:32:16,599 --> 02:32:24,006
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will take that as something to do to go back and find that information so that we can see

939
02:32:25,206 --> 02:32:27,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the city's budget ordinance is also new.

940
02:32:28,348 --> 02:32:36,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's impossible for us to meet their deadline, then I think that that's a conversation.

941
02:32:38,174 --> 02:32:44,255
[SPEAKER_01]: that we could have with the council, but I just wanted to point that out.

942
02:32:46,316 --> 02:33:03,379
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an excellent point, and I think we should probably call out the capital plan specifically in the timeline, and we can definitely figure out a way to get that done ahead of the general fund budget.

943
02:33:07,452 --> 02:33:08,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. McHugh.

944
02:33:08,432 --> 02:33:08,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

945
02:33:08,953 --> 02:33:10,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

946
02:33:10,313 --> 02:33:12,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld, you had a question.

947
02:33:12,254 --> 02:33:27,340
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I just wanted to ask if this was a proposed change to the policy itself or if this was a for this year only given that we are like, we're looking at a proposed budget supplement and some restructuring based on the override results.

948
02:33:30,059 --> 02:33:37,187
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, as member Rousseau stated, this is our first year working with it.

949
02:33:39,426 --> 02:33:59,180
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can work with the revised schedule this year, it might make sense at the beginning of next year's budget development to take a look at that calendar, see if it worked for the school committee, see if it worked for the school department, and then make any appropriate changes.

950
02:33:59,300 --> 02:34:05,324
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it does work, I would assume that it might become permanent.

951
02:34:07,051 --> 02:34:12,193
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I also just wanted to note that we have scheduled a budget hearing for February 26th.

952
02:34:12,853 --> 02:34:17,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's putting it right up at this deadline here.

953
02:34:17,475 --> 02:34:33,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as the year progresses, the school committee will begin to identify dates when they wanna have meetings to collect information and those will just get plugged into the calendar.

954
02:34:34,441 --> 02:34:44,487
[SPEAKER_11]: But we had voted to approve that schedule with the public hearing and then another optional public hearing if needed after the request.

955
02:34:45,467 --> 02:34:48,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we could send you those dates, Jerry.

956
02:34:49,370 --> 02:34:53,352
[SPEAKER_06]: You could send your recommendations for adjustments.

957
02:34:55,633 --> 02:35:03,456
[SPEAKER_00]: I am proposing that we kind of push that February deadline to March.

958
02:35:04,636 --> 02:35:20,022
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second public hearing was, I think, in the event that the budget the school committee approved was not the budget that the mayor would recommend or that the city council would approve.

959
02:35:20,922 --> 02:35:30,424
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have an opportunity to have another public hearing to discuss kind of how we're going to reconcile those two budget lines.

960
02:35:36,466 --> 02:35:43,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, we have, Jerry, we did schedule February 26, April 30, and then June 9.

961
02:35:43,568 --> 02:35:48,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're asking to move the 2-26 to sometime in late March?

962
02:35:49,619 --> 02:36:04,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll look at those dates, and then someone will get a communication back with maybe some proposed alternative dates based on the draft calendar.

963
02:36:05,792 --> 02:36:06,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

964
02:36:06,192 --> 02:36:06,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

965
02:36:07,753 --> 02:36:10,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld, if you're all set, I'm going to pass the floor to Member Graham.

966
02:36:12,554 --> 02:36:12,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

967
02:36:13,475 --> 02:36:19,299
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to call out for the group that the capital planning piece is on track.

968
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:23,522
[SPEAKER_12]: We have one more subcommittee meeting next week, I believe.

969
02:36:24,122 --> 02:36:37,512
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have a committee of the whole scheduled for December to do the committee of the whole here to understand what the capital plan looks like for the remainder of the year.

970
02:36:37,572 --> 02:36:38,393
[SPEAKER_12]: So that'll be done.

971
02:36:41,339 --> 02:36:46,654
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we should try this revised calendar for this year in particular because we're also just about to ask.

972
02:36:48,026 --> 02:36:54,330
[SPEAKER_12]: the budget director to put a supplemental budget together for this fiscal year, which was not planned when we put all this together.

973
02:36:54,390 --> 02:37:02,896
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think as long as we can give the council an appropriate heads up that whatever they were expecting from us is going to shift a little bit, I think it'll be fine.

974
02:37:03,936 --> 02:37:06,718
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I do think we should talk about it after it's done.

975
02:37:06,778 --> 02:37:13,142
[SPEAKER_12]: And presumably next year, we're not talking about a supplemental budget and decide if the timeline worked or it doesn't work.

976
02:37:15,745 --> 02:37:15,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

977
02:37:16,205 --> 02:37:17,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Graham.

978
02:37:17,365 --> 02:37:18,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. McHugh.

979
02:37:18,386 --> 02:37:22,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll await those date changes and coordinate accordingly.

980
02:37:23,167 --> 02:37:26,227
[SPEAKER_06]: The sooner the better, obviously, to get it in our calendars.

981
02:37:27,268 --> 02:37:28,028
[SPEAKER_06]: No further questions?

982
02:37:28,968 --> 02:37:29,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

983
02:37:30,268 --> 02:37:33,389
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go on to the rest of the agenda.

984
02:37:33,569 --> 02:37:36,510
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not have any presentations of the public.

985
02:37:37,090 --> 02:37:38,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a number of items on a new business.

986
02:37:38,371 --> 02:37:45,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a number of items on a new business, but we have a number of items on a new business 2024-4041 offered by myself mayor brand along the current.

987
02:37:45,776 --> 02:37:54,322
[SPEAKER_06]: The school public schools in accordance with master law 149 a section for a one authorizes using construction management at risk services.

988
02:37:54,942 --> 02:38:00,266
[SPEAKER_06]: The McGlynn school complex and Andrews middle school H back upgrade project and authorizes

989
02:38:06,210 --> 02:38:08,832
[SPEAKER_06]: all of its obligations in connection with the project.

990
02:38:10,273 --> 02:38:19,961
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, through the chair, we are moving along with our HVAC projects and this will just allow contracts to be signed, so I would ask for a motion for approval.

991
02:38:20,462 --> 02:38:21,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to table.

992
02:38:23,304 --> 02:38:27,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table by Member Ruseau, seconded by... Can I explain why?

993
02:38:27,808 --> 02:38:29,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, Member Ruseau.

994
02:38:30,189 --> 02:38:35,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this is, our attorney does not feel like this is actually something we can approve at this time.

995
02:38:37,264 --> 02:38:39,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could be wrong, I take the table back.

996
02:38:40,706 --> 02:38:41,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

997
02:38:42,026 --> 02:38:42,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I jump in?

998
02:38:43,227 --> 02:38:43,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham.

999
02:38:43,987 --> 02:38:44,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1000
02:38:45,708 --> 02:38:51,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I did talk to our attorney today and I actually talked to Director Hunt as well.

1001
02:38:52,011 --> 02:39:00,174
[SPEAKER_12]: So CM at risk, the only person in city who is able to sign a CM at risk contract is the mayor on behalf of the city.

1002
02:39:01,635 --> 02:39:05,797
[SPEAKER_12]: What this is doing is just authorizing her to sign a CM at risk contract.

1003
02:39:06,817 --> 02:39:16,060
[SPEAKER_12]: which essentially allows us to bring the construction folks into the project much sooner than in the typical procurement process.

1004
02:39:16,180 --> 02:39:24,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And what that is supposed to do is generate a like sort of tighter handoff between the design folks and the construction folks.

1005
02:39:25,204 --> 02:39:31,646
[SPEAKER_12]: So you don't have the situation where the design folks design something and the construction folks are like, I can't do that.

1006
02:39:32,076 --> 02:39:34,258
[SPEAKER_12]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): Or whatever the reason might be.

1007
02:39:34,298 --> 02:39:39,662
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's pretty new to Medford that we are entertaining CM at risk in general.

1008
02:39:40,003 --> 02:39:53,014
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know MSBA is definitely a fan of CM at risk projects for for big building projects, but I did talk to everybody today and this resolution is just about

1009
02:39:53,574 --> 02:39:58,498
[SPEAKER_12]: the contract itself and the mayor, the mayor of the city is the only one who can sign it.

1010
02:39:58,598 --> 02:40:12,649
[SPEAKER_12]: So I feel like based on what I was able to learn today, and I did talk to our attorney on the way out, this is in fact consistent with what needs to happen in order to allow that work to proceed.

1011
02:40:14,431 --> 02:40:20,536
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he has other steps he has to take that he's less clear about, but this is a step that only we can take.

1012
02:40:21,187 --> 02:40:24,069
[SPEAKER_12]: And until we take it, they can't move forward with procurement.

1013
02:40:24,329 --> 02:40:24,529
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

1014
02:40:26,131 --> 02:40:27,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Ruseau.

1015
02:40:28,112 --> 02:40:28,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1016
02:40:28,612 --> 02:40:38,139
[SPEAKER_01]: So is our attorney still being asked to sign something for which he does not think he certainly does not feel comfortable signing at this point?

1017
02:40:38,419 --> 02:40:40,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that not based on this?

1018
02:40:40,541 --> 02:40:46,125
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is not a separate piece of the puzzle that will have to be addressed, but it's not this.

1019
02:40:46,785 --> 02:40:47,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will not.

1020
02:40:48,544 --> 02:40:50,365
[SPEAKER_01]: put him in a place where he has no options?

1021
02:40:50,565 --> 02:40:50,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

1022
02:40:51,405 --> 02:40:55,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, then I withdraw my table, which I think I already did that.

1023
02:40:56,807 --> 02:40:57,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve.

1024
02:40:57,747 --> 02:40:58,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to second.

1025
02:40:58,767 --> 02:41:04,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, motion to table has been taken off the floor.

1026
02:41:04,829 --> 02:41:07,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ruseau.

1027
02:41:08,031 --> 02:41:08,811
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1028
02:41:09,351 --> 02:41:09,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1029
02:41:09,791 --> 02:41:10,491
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1030
02:41:11,352 --> 02:41:12,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1031
02:41:13,611 --> 02:41:34,851
[SPEAKER_06]: 2024-42 offered by member Reinfeld whereas a resolution was offered and approved at the June 24 2024 special meeting of the member school committee that the committee receive a report by December 15, describing the implementation impact of position reductions between the previous and current budget year to inform the budget request for the upcoming fiscal year.

1032
02:41:36,480 --> 02:41:56,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas the voters of Medford authorized on November 5, 2024 the assessment of additional tax funds to support the district staffing needs and expand access to programming, be it therefore resolved the report shall focus on concerns identified during the spring budget hearings and prioritizes expressed during the fall campaign season

1033
02:41:56,577 --> 02:42:09,220
[SPEAKER_06]: including but not limited to the district's ability to provide students with ongoing and acute mental health support are some vocational programming and administrative support as well as the effect of staffing changes on class and caseload sizes.

1034
02:42:09,892 --> 02:42:18,695
[SPEAKER_06]: He further resolved that the presentation of the report be limited to roles and responsibilities independent of individual employees' performances and other confidential matters.

1035
02:42:19,515 --> 02:42:20,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld.

1036
02:42:20,475 --> 02:42:20,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1037
02:42:20,935 --> 02:42:24,116
[SPEAKER_11]: So this was just to bring this request to the forefront.

1038
02:42:24,436 --> 02:42:35,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually gonna make a motion to consolidate this with the following resolution because I would be happy to see this report, the summary of what our position responsibilities are looking like.

1039
02:42:36,380 --> 02:42:43,469
[SPEAKER_11]: to inform the next budget cycle to be part of the justification for the budget cycle.

1040
02:42:43,929 --> 02:42:47,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So motion to consolidate by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Graham.

1041
02:42:48,334 --> 02:42:49,115
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1042
02:42:49,135 --> 02:42:49,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1043
02:42:50,116 --> 02:42:50,677
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1044
02:42:50,737 --> 02:42:51,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1045
02:42:52,019 --> 02:42:55,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll read the next agenda item that it will be consolidated with.

1046
02:42:57,605 --> 02:43:13,079
[SPEAKER_06]: 2024-43 offered by myself, Mayor Lungo-Koehn and Member Graham, be it resolved that the administration will present a proposed supplemental budget to account for funds made available through the passage of ballot questions 7 and 8 at our January 13th school committee meeting.

1047
02:43:16,422 --> 02:43:17,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor, Member Graham.

1048
02:43:18,024 --> 02:43:18,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1049
02:43:21,525 --> 02:43:30,714
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm super excited that we get to talk about this because it means we were successful in generating $7 million more dollars a year for our schools.

1050
02:43:30,814 --> 02:43:33,978
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you to every voter out there who supported this.

1051
02:43:34,078 --> 02:43:41,585
[SPEAKER_12]: It's super important and there's a million, 7 million reasons actually why I'm excited about it.

1052
02:43:42,947 --> 02:43:50,355
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of like moving parts of how this works mechanically and I think the city is like finding its way through all of that because we've never done this before.

1053
02:43:51,276 --> 02:44:00,507
[SPEAKER_12]: The council does have papers in front of them to appropriate the money to us, and then in turn what that means is we will need to

1054
02:44:01,928 --> 02:44:07,877
[SPEAKER_12]: have a public budget hearing like we always do to determine the spending of that money.

1055
02:44:07,897 --> 02:44:17,610
[SPEAKER_12]: The ballot questions were effective July 1 2024 so that does mean the full amount of $7 million will be available

1056
02:44:18,792 --> 02:44:32,607
[SPEAKER_12]: via the override question will begin to be collected come the January tax bills, but we will have an opportunity to put together a supplemental budget for it to be spent in the last six months of this year.

1057
02:44:32,627 --> 02:44:39,314
[SPEAKER_12]: That has to be consistent with the spirit and nature of the questions and so that is very specific.

1058
02:44:40,255 --> 02:44:43,476
[SPEAKER_12]: to answer all the questions of like, will the money be spent how it's supposed to?

1059
02:44:43,616 --> 02:44:45,196
[SPEAKER_12]: The answer is yes, it has to be.

1060
02:44:46,336 --> 02:44:53,658
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's going to take some time, I think, for the for the budget director to put together what that spending proposal is.

1061
02:44:53,678 --> 02:44:59,619
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's going to take a fair bit of work on behalf of the administration to put that together.

1062
02:44:59,699 --> 02:45:02,920
[SPEAKER_12]: So really sorry, we're asking you to do that between now and January.

1063
02:45:03,721 --> 02:45:17,234
[SPEAKER_12]: But it is really urgent because the money, the money does have to be expended in FY 25 so it would be the $7 million in total, less the advance, which we have actually already spent which was 1.75 million dollars.

1064
02:45:17,274 --> 02:45:19,316
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's 5.25 million dollars in total.

1065
02:45:24,501 --> 02:45:30,685
[SPEAKER_12]: 1.25 of that million dollars is related to the things outlined in question 7.

1066
02:45:30,725 --> 02:45:35,068
[SPEAKER_12]: 4 million outlined to the things outlined in question 8.

1067
02:45:35,429 --> 02:45:37,010
[SPEAKER_12]: They are slightly different.

1068
02:45:37,050 --> 02:45:44,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, for example, maintenance is a question 7 item that was articulated, not a question 8 item that was articulated.

1069
02:45:44,935 --> 02:45:50,900
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's going to be a fair bit of work on the budget director's part to figure out what this looks like going forward.

1070
02:45:52,041 --> 02:45:58,145
[SPEAKER_12]: and how we advance things like the consolidated school schedule that Mr. Fallon was just here talking about.

1071
02:45:59,326 --> 02:46:06,711
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's just, there is a literal ton of work to be able to do any of the things that we were hoping to be able to do.

1072
02:46:06,831 --> 02:46:15,438
[SPEAKER_12]: So the resolution asks that the administration come back to us at the beginning of January with that proposed supplemental budget.

1073
02:46:16,058 --> 02:46:18,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And now based on member Reinfeld's

1074
02:46:19,020 --> 02:46:31,785
[SPEAKER_12]: resolution, specifically paying attention to those areas that were cut last year, like nurses, for example, guidance Councilors, etc.

1075
02:46:31,865 --> 02:46:41,570
[SPEAKER_12]: So that we can assess whether, like our secretary at the our administrative assistant and a second administrative assistant at the McGlynn complex, for example.

1076
02:46:42,890 --> 02:46:46,952
[SPEAKER_12]: So those things were cut out of the budget last year, there is an opportunity for us to sort of

1077
02:46:48,032 --> 02:46:52,336
[SPEAKER_12]: remediate that now that the supplemental budget has gone through.

1078
02:46:52,376 --> 02:47:11,251
[SPEAKER_12]: And the question is, I think to member Reinfeld's point, how is it going with this change in staffing and where are the places that we need to shore up and which of those places can we do in the short term in the right now and which of them are really school year positions so that we can plan accordingly for that as well.

1079
02:47:15,612 --> 02:47:21,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I will just add this bit at the end of my resolution about limited to roles and responsibilities.

1080
02:47:21,075 --> 02:47:36,523
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just to say what I'm not looking for is a conversation about people's performances and how individual people are and are not meeting these responsibilities is what is the need, what are the responsibilities, and do we need to make that a permanent, do we need a

1081
02:47:38,870 --> 02:47:43,571
[SPEAKER_11]: temporary coverage for this role, or should this be built into the new budget?

1082
02:47:43,711 --> 02:47:48,132
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to clarify, it shouldn't need to be said confidential matters, stay confidential.

1083
02:47:48,312 --> 02:47:53,714
[SPEAKER_11]: But I want to be really clear, this is about the need and the responsibilities that people have in the system.

1084
02:47:53,994 --> 02:47:59,235
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm excited to have that conversation about how we can meet students needs through some of the supplemental funding.

1085
02:48:00,335 --> 02:48:08,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I may, through the chair, Member Reinfeld, when you wanted them consolidated, are you looking for your information also on January 7th?

1086
02:48:08,203 --> 02:48:09,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we consolidating that date?

1087
02:48:09,884 --> 02:48:10,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1088
02:48:10,145 --> 02:48:12,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so all the information on the two resolutions.

1089
02:48:12,967 --> 02:48:16,811
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to make the administration prepare a report for our December 16th meeting.

1090
02:48:16,831 --> 02:48:18,372
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was just making sure of.

1091
02:48:19,513 --> 02:48:22,536
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're looking to see that on January 13th.

1092
02:48:22,616 --> 02:48:24,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, is there a motion on the floor for approval?

1093
02:48:25,239 --> 02:48:26,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve a member.

1094
02:48:27,902 --> 02:48:32,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Graham seconded by second member Reinfeld, all those in favor, may I, there are those.

1095
02:48:33,628 --> 02:48:40,995
[SPEAKER_01]: So, can we just say we're approving as consolidated I wrote the language but you're not going to make me read it are you motion to approve as consolidated.

1096
02:48:41,075 --> 02:48:41,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1097
02:48:43,339 --> 02:48:43,919
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor?

1098
02:48:43,939 --> 02:48:44,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1099
02:48:45,800 --> 02:48:46,281
[SPEAKER_06]: All opposed?

1100
02:48:46,501 --> 02:48:48,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1101
02:48:48,462 --> 02:49:08,434
[SPEAKER_06]: 2024-44, be it resolved the Medford School Committee formally appoints Will Papaselli as a non-voting member of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee and remove Mr. Thomas Dalton as a non-voting member.

1102
02:49:09,235 --> 02:49:09,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

1103
02:49:17,386 --> 02:49:20,008
[SPEAKER_09]: just had to make sure to turn this on, but I've seen it going on for a month now.

1104
02:49:21,329 --> 02:49:26,113
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you Mayor Lungo-Koehnan and members of the school committee for allowing me to speak tonight.

1105
02:49:26,294 --> 02:49:32,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thrilled with the opportunity to join the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee in this non-voting role.

1106
02:49:32,773 --> 02:49:39,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Throughout my time so far in Medford as the Director of Communications, it's really clear to see what makes Medford Public Schools so special.

1107
02:49:39,961 --> 02:49:54,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so far this year alone, we're only in November, we have new community spaces at the McGlynn Elementary School with a new playground, the new Memorial Garden that we just opened up at the high school last fall, the Clippership Pop-Up Park that I know National Arts Honor Society members

1108
02:49:55,057 --> 02:49:56,457
[SPEAKER_09]: and students help decorate.

1109
02:49:56,477 --> 02:50:03,799
[SPEAKER_09]: So all these wonderful spaces, our educators and school staff members continue to enhance the social and emotional learning of our students.

1110
02:50:04,459 --> 02:50:08,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I encourage people to check out a story coming on the radio later this week.

1111
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:12,920
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I'll say for now on Billy and Lisa in the morning show.

1112
02:50:13,820 --> 02:50:19,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Most importantly, though, our students are really demonstrating the tremendous growth inside and outside the classroom.

1113
02:50:19,601 --> 02:50:22,642
[SPEAKER_09]: My main goal when accepting this position in the role of

1114
02:50:23,522 --> 02:50:27,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Directive Communications is really sharing all the positivity that's happening in this district.

1115
02:50:28,026 --> 02:50:40,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I think throughout these last few meetings, and even with Mr. Fallon's presentation tonight, it's clear that students are doing so many amazing things and continuing to uplift that is what makes this role so important.

1116
02:50:41,941 --> 02:50:50,446
[SPEAKER_09]: But being based at the high school, I really have daily insight into the community spirit, Mr. Ball, Mr. Fallon, and their team are doing into bettering the educational environment for our students.

1117
02:50:51,026 --> 02:51:02,773
[SPEAKER_09]: That enrollment report presented tonight shows the increasing desire for students to participate in the vocational educational experience and really highlights the limitation our current high school provides.

1118
02:51:03,433 --> 02:51:08,957
[SPEAKER_09]: With that recent passing of question seven and eight, it really demonstrates the community's desire to invest in education.

1119
02:51:09,398 --> 02:51:19,626
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really look forward to collaborating with you on the school committee, as well as members of the administrative team to appropriately communicate to the community about the effects of that monumental decision.

1120
02:51:20,407 --> 02:51:25,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as it relates to the new high school building committee, I have already helped the committee as an unofficial member.

1121
02:51:25,531 --> 02:51:31,596
[SPEAKER_09]: I've helped create the enrollment projections and the maintenance and capital plan reports and really digestible language for the community.

1122
02:51:32,683 --> 02:51:43,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I helped do the meeting minutes for September's committee meeting and the subcommittee communications committee meeting, and then also joined in on a number of tours through our neighboring school districts over these last few weeks.

1123
02:51:43,791 --> 02:51:54,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I also spoke to our final site website development team last week and just getting more information on what a dedicated website would look like for this new project.

1124
02:51:55,545 --> 02:52:03,411
[SPEAKER_09]: This early work has not only increased my appreciation for the efforts that have already been done, but also grown my desire to really be a part of this process.

1125
02:52:04,072 --> 02:52:10,797
[SPEAKER_09]: And then lastly, I just want to use this time to express my sincerest appreciation for our previous communications director Thomas Dolan.

1126
02:52:11,497 --> 02:52:13,978
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been tremendously helpful in the transition for me.

1127
02:52:14,278 --> 02:52:19,000
[SPEAKER_09]: He actually came to the office last week, and we got to chat for a good 45 minutes or so.

1128
02:52:19,700 --> 02:52:27,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And also the superintendent, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, for providing me with this opportunity to join Mustang Nation and her support since I joined in July.

1129
02:52:27,884 --> 02:52:40,169
[SPEAKER_09]: In an age where really building trust and community through communication with constituents is more crucial than ever, even themes that we've spoken about tonight through various presentations, I'm really thankful and eager for this opportunity to join the committee in this role.

1130
02:52:40,389 --> 02:52:41,009
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1131
02:52:41,872 --> 02:52:45,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Will, for all you've done, and we look forward to having you on the committee.

1132
02:52:47,456 --> 02:52:47,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor?

1133
02:52:48,096 --> 02:52:50,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

1134
02:52:50,297 --> 02:52:55,661
[SPEAKER_12]: We do need to take an official vote so that I can send everything to MSBA.

1135
02:52:55,861 --> 02:52:57,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion for approval by Member Graham.

1136
02:52:57,382 --> 02:52:58,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I had one quick question.

1137
02:52:59,123 --> 02:53:00,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Reinhold.

1138
02:53:01,064 --> 02:53:02,505
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm fully in favor of this.

1139
02:53:02,826 --> 02:53:08,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Does this also place him on the Communications and Community Engagement Subcommittee?

1140
02:53:09,210 --> 02:53:09,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a?

1141
02:53:09,930 --> 02:53:12,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yeah, because I think that's really important here.

1142
02:53:12,712 --> 02:53:13,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he has.

1143
02:53:13,833 --> 02:53:15,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, has already said that he's been supporting it.

1144
02:53:16,035 --> 02:53:19,518
[SPEAKER_11]: But is do we need to formally do that as we don't need to do that here?

1145
02:53:19,618 --> 02:53:22,560
[SPEAKER_12]: The building building committee has handled that.

1146
02:53:22,661 --> 02:53:23,421
[SPEAKER_12]: So great.

1147
02:53:23,581 --> 02:53:25,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to motion for approval.

1148
02:53:27,665 --> 02:53:31,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by Member Graham seconded by Member Reinfeld.

1149
02:53:31,087 --> 02:53:31,808
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1150
02:53:31,828 --> 02:53:32,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1151
02:53:32,729 --> 02:53:33,429
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1152
02:53:33,810 --> 02:53:34,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1153
02:53:35,231 --> 02:53:35,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

1154
02:53:35,531 --> 02:53:36,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so

1155
02:53:37,623 --> 02:53:38,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, we have condolences.

1156
02:53:39,024 --> 02:53:52,892
[SPEAKER_06]: The members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Maureen L. Kidney, mother of Kim Flaherty, who worked at Medford High School in support of transportation and is a member of our administrative assistant unit.

1157
02:53:53,673 --> 02:54:03,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Laurel Schumann, mother of Johanna Granada, speech therapist at the Roberts Elementary School.

1158
02:54:03,759 --> 02:54:05,260
[SPEAKER_06]: We all may rise for a moment of silence.

1159
02:54:18,649 --> 02:54:19,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1160
02:54:19,930 --> 02:54:27,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next regular meeting is back in the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom on Monday, December 2nd.

1161
02:54:28,857 --> 02:54:29,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion?

1162
02:54:29,377 --> 02:54:30,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

1163
02:54:30,258 --> 02:54:34,221
[SPEAKER_06]: By Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Branley.

1164
02:54:34,641 --> 02:54:35,362
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1165
02:54:35,742 --> 02:54:35,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1166
02:54:36,202 --> 02:54:36,843
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1167
02:54:37,383 --> 02:54:38,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
