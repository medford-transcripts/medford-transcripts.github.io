1
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:21,279
Esquerra y Casco, and to close this first International Asset Forum, we welcome again Yolanda Díaz, Vice-President II and Minister of Labour and Social Economy.

2
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:22,441
A round of applause.

3
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:53,313
Good afternoon, dear Minister of Senegal, Secretaries of Brazil, Kenya, France, dear Vice-President Dakari and Government Delegate, dear President Cepes, dear Juan Antonio, dear Director of ASED, dear Inigo, dear members of the International Council of ASED,

4
00:00:54,414 --> 00:01:02,118
Dear Directors-General of the various autonomous communities that you are here presenting, in short, friends of the social economy.

5
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:08,861
We have reached the end of this valuable forum with the certainty of having opened a new cycle.

6
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:26,502
A fertile space of meeting, of shared thinking that drives us to look, as I said before, with audacity, at the deep meaning of our work, which, in short, is to take care of life, democratize the economy and transform the common.

7
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:48,388
We do it in a time marked by the polycrisis, an ecological crisis that questions the very continuity of life on the planet... ...a crisis also of a fundamental right such as housing, which turns a basic right into an unattainable luxury for many people in our societies...

8
00:01:49,228 --> 00:02:06,982
...a food and energy crisis amplified by speculation and extractivism... ...and a youth that seemed condemned to precariousness... ...care taken to the limit and an increasingly distant citizenship from the decisions that determine their lives.

9
00:02:07,722 --> 00:02:13,045
In the face of this landscape, we do not settle down, we rebel and we do it in the hands of the social economy.

10
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:17,888
We do not want to resign ourselves, we want to move forward.

11
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:20,229
We are friends and friends of hope.

12
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:28,234
We do not do it with nostalgia, we do it knowing that there is a common material called hope, which is what makes the moods change without a doubt and makes societies move.

13
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:43,460
The social economy, as I said, is not an ornament, it is not a qualifier, it is not even a nuance in the capitalist economy.

14
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:55,745
It is a structural alternative, it is a way of life, it is a different way of inhabiting the world... ...that is based on solidarity, cooperation, equity, sustainability and social justice.

15
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:05,292
In the face of the mandate to compete, I believe that the social economy shares that it cooperates, that we support each other.

16
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:14,254
In the face of the save-it-who-can, which is nothing more than a trajectory of failure, we propose to take care of each other.

17
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:20,916
In the face of those invisible hands and the chainsaws, we propose to democratize every corner of our lives.

18
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:25,059
And above all, we propose to build, to build in a positive way.

19
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,702
Because it is not enough to break everything, to destroy.

20
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:31,024
I insist, it will not resist.

21
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:36,569
We need to build a new architecture that is economic and that starts from the bottom.

22
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:43,876
And the social economy, if you allow me, has the values, the practices and the democratic legitimacy precisely to do so.

23
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:50,739
We have seen it in all the areas where large social fractures are concentrated today.

24
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,600
I have mentioned it in the right to housing.

25
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:02,202
We have social economy initiatives that guarantee access worthy of sustainable and community models.

26
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:12,325
Also, in the energy transition, with proposals that understand the energy, democratized, distributed, as a common good, not as a commodity.

27
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:28,294
We see it in the financial system, with alternatives, as I pointed out before, in the ethical, solidary and democratic interventions that prioritize people, projects, and not the form of speculative capital.

28
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,355
Let me share an example that illustrates it clearly.

29
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:37,659
After the DANA, in the days of the DANA, you, as you know, in the face of the suffering of the Valencian people,

30
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:49,568
The SEAS network boosted a solidary fund in record time that raised close to 60,000 euros to support the most affected social economy initiatives.

31
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:52,490
We are always where we have to be.

32
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,932
There was no last-minute rescue.

33
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:57,914
There was solidarity from the first minute.

34
00:04:57,934 --> 00:04:59,855
Real cooperation, mutual support.

35
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:01,836
That is the social economy.

36
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:05,657
That is how this model of social economy works.

37
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:09,838
Where others retreat, the social economy advances.

38
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:13,479
Where others speculate, we take care.

39
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:18,320
Where others divide, fragment and generate hatred, we weave community.

40
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:31,549
To speak today about this project is to remember that another economy is possible when the need, the dignity of work, the decent work of the ILO and the collective intelligence are combined.

41
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:43,538
I am going to allow myself to tell you, being here today in Donostia, that in the middle of the post-war period, from Mondragón, with barely any resources, I was able to imagine and build a profoundly transformative alternative.

42
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:49,905
Today, you are an inspiration for our country and for the whole world.

43
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:53,190
Those were very difficult times, certainly more difficult than now.

44
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,577
Your legacy, therefore, is multiplied today by hundreds of experiences shared around the world.

45
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:04,717
The social and solidarity economy is neither a memory nor a promise.

46
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:17,967
It is present, it is action, like the call to action, the manifesto that we signed today with Professor Piketty and with Professor Ferreras and with so many people who label that call.

47
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:23,751
It is a living reality and it can and should also be the future.

48
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:26,473
Look, in the past, when the future was projected,

49
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,296
It was a desirable imaginary.

50
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:36,920
They talked about youth as the future and it was something positive.

51
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,042
And today they want us to think of that future and youth as something dystopian, as something negative.

52
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:43,924
And we are not going to allow it.

53
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:48,626
And the social economy knows that the future, the present and the future is full of hope.

54
00:06:50,287 --> 00:07:18,120
I finish by thanking you, with a sincere emotion, sharing these days, these hours, which I also think do us good, from the love and humanity, this is also to make public policy from affection, and I want to thank those invisible people, dear Carmen, who have made it possible that everything we have here, nothing fails, is possible, and I think it is the invisible ones who are also

55
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:21,576
friends and sisters of the social economy.

56
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:41,358
And if you allow me, thanks to SET, which was born with a global vocation, from the local, dreaming, but from an inclusive and transformative vocation.

57
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:46,639
Thanks to CEPES, as always, and to all the Basque institutions that are here today.

58
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:55,061
For me, this is very important because we are demonstrating that many administrations, which, well, we will think differently, we are able to help each other.

59
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:58,178
And this is democracy.

60
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:03,902
Democracy is walking with people who make synthesis, who don't think alike.

61
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:13,329
Dear Íñigo, sharing projects with people who think exactly like you, first of all, no one thinks exactly like the other, fortunately, but that doesn't make much sense.

62
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:21,072
...public policy, public networks, is to make a synthesis, and not because I like social dialogue... ...that I like social dialogue.

63
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:30,057
But the other thing is not public policy, it is to stay at home... ...reflecting on a truth that, by the way, is quite impure.

64
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:36,760
Therefore, thanks to all the Basque institutions, the commitment of the Spanish government in this project.

65
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,101
And I'll finish.

66
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:55,774
Thanks to those people and families in the social economy who, in a Mayan way, are all over the country doing wonderful things, from Galicia, I have to talk a little about Galicia, I'm Galician, going through Murcia, which Juan Antonio is already doing, who is there, but all over the country.

67
00:08:55,834 --> 00:09:00,517
In short, I think you are the ones who make it make sense.

68
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:06,082
In short, thank you for being part of this network and for giving an example

69
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:08,583
to the world of hope.

70
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:13,865
I also end by thanking the work we are doing at an international level.

71
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:21,088
Today we are a source of inspiration, of light in the whole world, and it is not a small thing.

72
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:28,971
I think we have sons and daughters who deserve to live with dignity and, of course, on behalf of the Government of Spain, if it depends on us, it will not.

73
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:30,352
Thank you very much and good luck.

74
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,368
Thank you very much, Minister Andréa.

75
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:56,312
Thank you all for coming from so many places around the world to participate in this first ASET International Forum.

76
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:17,490
We close this forum with these words, with the Minister's thanks and thanking you once again for coming here to Donostias.
