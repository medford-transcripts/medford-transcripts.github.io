134
00:25:54,598 --> 00:26:03,700
[SPEAKER_04]: With our program being so new to the Medford High School community, it's really amazing to see how well they have done in such a short amount of time.

135
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:13,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So much camaraderie, spirit, teamwork, and ultimate success is really something to be acknowledged and appreciated.

[SPEAKER_04]: So a round of applause for our esports team.

137
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:38,101
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, and we're going to do this for all of the acknowledgements this evening, we'll have the coaches come to the rail, they'll say a few words, and then they'll read the students' names.

138
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:45,084
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take a team group photo, and then certificates will go to the coaches for dissemination to the team.

139
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:50,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so at this moment, I'd like to ask Mr. McCready and Mr. Maldonado to come on up.

140
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:53,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

141
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone.

142
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:12,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Esports started up about four years ago, and just to see how far the kids have come with the program, and just the community has been awesome, a huge support, and just the fact that this is very important to the students, and really just their education.

143
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:13,709
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't thank you enough.

144
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:22,614
[SPEAKER_11]: We're lucky to have four teams at Medford High, and the winning coach, Mr. McCready, is gonna go ahead and read the students' names.

[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't have a chance to capture that.

297
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:21,068
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were able to capture the second varsity four

298
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:32,333
[SPEAKER_01]: a bronze medal, and the four kids that were in that boat will be heading to the nationals to represent us in the youth under 17 double sculling.

299
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:40,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is Jaden Wu, Owen Bacaracro, Adam Cezars, and Henry Gregoire.

300
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:17,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

301
00:50:17,777 --> 00:50:25,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my bad.

302
00:51:03,882 --> 00:51:05,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all for joining us tonight.

303
00:51:05,326 --> 00:51:06,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

304
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:09,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the hard work, and we can't wait to see you here again next year.

305
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're going to college, then kill it there too.

306
00:52:22,997 --> 00:52:37,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some citations.

307
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:51,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everybody.

308
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:53,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Great first hour for us.

309
00:52:54,763 --> 00:53:00,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up we have recognition of our retiring staff members with over 20 years of service to the Medford public schools.

310
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to turn it over again to Dr. Lucy.

311
00:53:04,395 --> 00:53:05,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

312
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:10,622
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very special acknowledgement for Medford public schools but also from

313
00:53:11,718 --> 00:53:12,198
[SPEAKER_04]: for myself.

314
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:34,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I know not everybody was able to be here tonight, but we really wanted to make sure to use this time to give special recognition to five Medford Public Schools employees who are retiring at the end of the school year and whom have each given at least more than 20 years of service to our students and our school communities.

315
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:40,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is very significant and really needs to be acknowledged and celebrated.

316
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:50,366
[SPEAKER_04]: So each of these five individuals have impacted hundreds, if not thousands of students during their time here and throughout their job roles.

317
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:59,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And we really want to thank them for everything they have done for their school communities and making it a better place and making our students feel warm and welcomed.

318
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:04,539
[SPEAKER_04]: We wish you all the best in the next chapter of your life.

319
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,385
[SPEAKER_04]: We know you're going to be going on to do other things, but we really wish you all the best.

320
00:54:09,925 --> 00:54:15,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And on behalf of the Metro Public Schools community, we wish you congratulations on your retirement.

321
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:28,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know not everyone was able to be here, but I still would like to acknowledge the five names, and then we'll call the two members up for their certificate from Mayor Burke.

322
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:29,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me.

323
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry.

324
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Langer-Kern.

325
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:35,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know if you wanted to say anything or if you want to.

326
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:41,608
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I believe we have two people here that have put in, Ms.

327
00:54:41,628 --> 00:54:46,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Gomez, you've put in 32 years for public schools, and Ms.

328
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Breen, 25 years.

329
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:50,992
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you're joined by your family because that's pretty extraordinary.

330
00:54:51,492 --> 00:54:59,616
[SPEAKER_06]: And like Dr. Galluzzi said, and I speak for the committee, thank you for everything you've done for our school system and for our students.

331
00:55:00,116 --> 00:55:00,876
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

332
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:04,158
[SPEAKER_06]: We wish you the best of luck in your next chapter.

333
00:55:04,672 --> 00:55:08,916
[SPEAKER_06]: in your future, I'm sure you'll still go out and do great things and have some time with your family.

334
00:55:09,997 --> 00:55:12,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for everything on behalf of myself and the school committee.

335
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:31,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll call you up in just one moment, but I do want to acknowledge, we also have Karen Roberto, a school nurse who gave us 25 years of service.

336
00:55:32,026 --> 00:55:39,010
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Jana Ewing, a second grade classroom teacher at the McGlynn, who gave us 34 years of service.

337
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:45,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And to Mary Hordy, who was a physical education teacher, 30 years of service.

338
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:47,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this time, we have, oh yeah, thank you.

339
00:56:00,876 --> 00:56:01,437
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to speak?

340
00:56:01,457 --> 00:56:03,038
[SPEAKER_08]: You take a picture?

341
00:56:03,378 --> 00:56:03,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, go ahead.

342
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:09,683
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to get the microphone on.

343
00:56:09,863 --> 00:56:10,704
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a red button.

344
00:56:12,906 --> 00:56:13,606
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a button.

345
00:56:13,867 --> 00:56:14,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

346
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:15,007
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's on.

347
00:56:15,027 --> 00:56:15,908
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody else pressed it.

348
00:56:15,948 --> 00:56:17,169
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, thank you so much.

349
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,910
[SPEAKER_21]: I really appreciate it.

350
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:24,675
[SPEAKER_21]: I literally didn't know why I was being invited to the school committee meeting.

351
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:27,537
[SPEAKER_21]: I kind of figured it out, but my daughter's here, so it's wonderful.

352
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:36,344
[SPEAKER_21]: So when I first started as a school counselor at the Dame, I was the only school counselor.

353
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:38,545
[SPEAKER_21]: There were no school psychologists.

354
00:56:38,585 --> 00:56:40,226
[SPEAKER_21]: There were no behaviorists.

355
00:56:40,786 --> 00:56:42,988
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was the only one for 10 years.

356
00:56:43,148 --> 00:56:45,369
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I started at the Brooks.

357
00:56:45,889 --> 00:56:49,791
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I was the only mental health person at that school.

358
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:54,274
[SPEAKER_21]: And now there are four full-time mental health staff

359
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:55,817
[SPEAKER_21]: at the school.

360
00:56:55,917 --> 00:57:04,363
[SPEAKER_21]: So it just shows you how the field has changed and how much need we have for mental health services in the public schools.

361
00:57:04,603 --> 00:57:12,329
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've loved it, and I'm going to be very sad, but 32 years, so I guess I can do something else now.

362
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,190
[SPEAKER_21]: It's my job.

363
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:13,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

364
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:14,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

365
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:41,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

366
00:57:41,894 --> 00:57:42,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

367
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,048
Bye.

368
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:47,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you again.

369
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:54,165
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have two additional people moving on, Dr. Cushing and Paul Texera.

370
00:58:54,185 --> 00:58:59,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to turn it again over to Dr. Galluzzi to start us off.

371
00:58:59,968 --> 00:59:01,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

372
00:59:01,729 --> 00:59:06,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to have Dr. Cushing and Mr. Paul Texera come

373
00:59:07,692 --> 00:59:08,453
[SPEAKER_04]: to the podium.

374
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a few words that I would like to say.

375
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:16,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I know that there are some members of the school committee that would also like to say a few words.

376
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:31,429
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know we've said this before at school committee meetings, but both Dr. Cushing and both Mr. Texera are leaving Medford Public Schools for superintendencies.

377
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing will, yes,

378
00:59:39,998 --> 00:59:48,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing is the next superintendent for Beverly Public Schools, and Mr. Teixeira is the next superintendent for Provincetown Public School.

379
00:59:51,257 --> 01:00:19,170
[SPEAKER_04]: So first, I just want to acknowledge, so for Peter, Dr. Cushing, we sincerely thank you for your six years of dedicated service to Metro Public Schools, to your commitment to maintaining and upgrading our facilities, our IT infrastructure, our innovation and enrichment opportunities for students, and security, as you've played a key role in creating a safe and supportive environment for our students and our staff.

380
01:00:20,385 --> 01:00:32,150
[SPEAKER_04]: As Dr. Cushing moves on to the next chapter of his career as the superintendent of Beverly Public Schools, we wish him success and express our deep appreciation for his contribution to Medford Public Schools.

381
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:39,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing, for the spirit you brought to the sentiment of, it's a great day to be a Mustang.

382
01:00:40,574 --> 01:00:47,757
[SPEAKER_04]: We agree and know that you will bring that spirit with you as you inspire Beverly Panther community.

383
01:00:48,969 --> 01:00:58,272
[SPEAKER_04]: To Mr. Teixeira, we extend our heartfelt thanks to you as our EL director for, I didn't know the exact number, Paul.

384
01:00:58,392 --> 01:00:59,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's over a decade.

385
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:02,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was wrong.

386
01:01:02,974 --> 01:01:04,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Just shy of a decade.

387
01:01:07,176 --> 01:01:07,656
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

388
01:01:08,396 --> 01:01:08,836
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

389
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:10,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Those COVID years count as 0.5.

390
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:30,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in your dedicated service to measure public schools, Paul's commitment to ensuring equitable instruction and opportunities for all students but specifically our English learners have made a lasting impact on our district, and in their lives.

391
01:01:31,372 --> 01:01:40,667
[SPEAKER_04]: And so while he also moves on to a superintendency, and it's wonderful news for Provincetown, it's certainly a little bittersweet for Medford.

392
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:44,573
[SPEAKER_04]: And Paul has pretty big shoes to fill.

393
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:55,187
[SPEAKER_04]: We will deeply miss your partnership, your guidance, and your strategic thinking, but don't worry, because I will be reaching out and touching base with you.

394
01:01:56,348 --> 01:02:09,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But in all seriousness, Mr. Texera, your skills and experience, you're ready for this new role, and though we will miss you greatly, we're confident that you're going to make a positive difference, and we're just a phone call away.

395
01:02:10,808 --> 01:02:17,720
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we kind of give something, I think there may be some school committee members that have a few words to say as well.

396
01:02:20,094 --> 01:02:21,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeldt.

397
01:02:21,896 --> 01:02:31,004
[SPEAKER_23]: So we got together and we got you some little things and we just want to say thank you for everything you've done for the district, for the schools of Medford.

398
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:40,672
[SPEAKER_23]: You've had your fingers in so many different projects over the years and I know I, whenever I would reach out and say, hey, what's going, what about this?

399
01:02:41,433 --> 01:02:45,554
[SPEAKER_23]: you were already on it, and I know that you were doing it for the students.

400
01:02:46,014 --> 01:02:52,396
[SPEAKER_23]: Your values and your actions were so beautifully aligned, and we really, really appreciate that.

401
01:02:52,496 --> 01:03:02,179
[SPEAKER_23]: So we have some cards, we have some tokens of appreciation, and also, do we want to share those or hand them out?

402
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:07,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we want to share.

403
01:03:07,861 --> 01:03:08,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

404
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:08,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rousseau?

405
01:03:11,836 --> 01:03:13,677
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, let's do this first, because this is fun.

406
01:03:19,581 --> 01:03:20,161
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

407
01:03:32,569 --> 01:03:34,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

408
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:35,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

409
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:36,311
[SPEAKER_18]: I will display it proudly.

410
01:03:49,507 --> 01:03:54,370
That is amazing.

411
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:56,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Reinfeld.

412
01:04:13,848 --> 01:04:22,793
[SPEAKER_23]: We also couldn't let you leave without a reminder of one of the projects, one of the perhaps unexpected projects that has haunted you for your entire time since I've been here.

413
01:04:22,873 --> 01:04:24,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

414
01:04:27,855 --> 01:04:30,877
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Murphy, you know.

415
01:04:31,037 --> 01:04:32,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

416
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau?

417
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:42,663
[SPEAKER_19]: That's awesome.

418
01:04:43,424 --> 01:04:43,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

419
01:04:43,945 --> 01:04:50,872
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to thank Paul and let him know that I look forward to perhaps having a place to stay in Provincetown.

420
01:04:52,674 --> 01:04:54,876
[SPEAKER_19]: Although I suspect that's a popular request.

421
01:04:55,917 --> 01:04:57,359
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so cheap to stay there.

422
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:04,486
[SPEAKER_19]: And Dr. Cushing, I wanted to thank you for your never ending ask about

423
01:05:06,525 --> 01:05:11,586
[SPEAKER_19]: self-reflection, but not doing it alone by asking me, you know, how am I doing?

424
01:05:11,726 --> 01:05:14,007
[SPEAKER_19]: And how does this seem?

425
01:05:14,047 --> 01:05:19,628
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, that level of openness to criticism I thought was refreshing.

426
01:05:20,168 --> 01:05:23,909
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, I could be blunt and honest with you, and you were totally fine with it.

427
01:05:23,949 --> 01:05:25,550
[SPEAKER_19]: And I appreciate that.

428
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:26,350
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm going to miss that.

429
01:05:32,091 --> 01:05:32,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

430
01:05:32,792 --> 01:05:33,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

431
01:05:34,012 --> 01:05:34,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

432
01:05:38,642 --> 01:05:38,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

433
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:44,047
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to echo what everyone has said already.

434
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:45,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you both so much.

435
01:05:48,271 --> 01:05:54,657
[SPEAKER_13]: How Medford has interacted with students has changed so dramatically in the last 10 years.

436
01:05:54,998 --> 01:05:57,360
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's all for the better.

437
01:05:57,961 --> 01:05:58,741
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're part of that.

438
01:05:58,801 --> 01:05:59,242
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

439
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:10,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to just say thank you so, so much for your years of service here in Medford.

440
01:06:11,316 --> 01:06:24,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter you were so many hats, so many times and you juggled so much and got the job done and Paul, same you over the years, especially through COVID just that calm presence and just

441
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:26,966
[SPEAKER_06]: great to have you as part of the team.

442
01:06:27,046 --> 01:06:32,711
[SPEAKER_06]: We are gonna, we are losing two very, very strong admin in the Medford Public Schools.

443
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:38,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Dr. Gullose will do her best with trying to fill your shoes, but it's gonna be very difficult.

444
01:06:38,055 --> 01:06:39,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for all you've done.

445
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ntapa.

446
01:06:49,045 --> 01:06:49,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mayor.

447
01:06:50,185 --> 01:06:52,326
[SPEAKER_15]: I just echo all the comments of my colleagues.

448
01:06:52,366 --> 01:06:58,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you both for doing all the work you've done to make the Medford Public Schools a better place for our students.

449
01:06:58,328 --> 01:07:05,070
[SPEAKER_15]: The framework you guys have set up will continue to do so even while you are both in your respective roles.

450
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:09,151
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it was funny, I think reflecting on the past

451
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:20,694
[SPEAKER_15]: not exactly two years of being here, you know, some of the two first thoughts I had was what exactly is Peter's job description because of the amount of hats that he wears and the amount of things he does, is he Marcont?

452
01:07:20,734 --> 01:07:21,394
[SPEAKER_15]: What is he doing?

453
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:28,396
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the second, when I state, you know, oh, I work for the Metropolitan School Committee, it's like, isn't Paul Teixeira just great?

454
01:07:29,136 --> 01:07:30,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't he just phenomenal?

455
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:35,959
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you both really are very key figures in our school system.

456
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:38,700
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to thank you both for doing, you know, the work that you've done.

457
01:07:40,913 --> 01:07:45,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the mayor said, it is bittersweet, but excited to see what you guys do next.

458
01:07:46,037 --> 01:07:46,518
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

459
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:55,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

460
01:07:58,987 --> 01:08:00,449
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Peter needs to wear the belt.

461
01:09:49,457 --> 01:09:56,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, we have the update to policy IKF, increased flexibility for students, health and physical education requirements.

462
01:09:57,142 --> 01:09:58,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Glucy.

463
01:09:58,843 --> 01:10:03,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

464
01:10:03,526 --> 01:10:04,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

465
01:10:07,845 --> 01:10:11,567
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know in your, we've had conversations back and forth.

466
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:19,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I know in your packets, you have the updated language for the graduation requirements for physical education and health.

467
01:10:20,451 --> 01:10:31,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I will review those and just let me know if you want it displayed, but in having conversations and director Rachel Perry is still here.

468
01:10:31,796 --> 01:10:34,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would invite her to the podium in case there are any questions.

469
01:10:35,972 --> 01:10:45,977
[SPEAKER_04]: What you have in front of you is the Medford Public Schools response to increasing flexibility for our students, which would move health one.

470
01:10:47,457 --> 01:10:57,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Students would either take health one in ninth grade or in 10th grade, depending on their schedule and the demands of each individual student's schedule.

471
01:10:58,383 --> 01:11:03,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And health two would either be completed in grade 10 or grade 11.

472
01:11:05,497 --> 01:11:17,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Physical education, the requirement is eight semesters of physical education with four enrolled in Medford Public Schools, Medford High School courses.

473
01:11:17,928 --> 01:11:20,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second four students would have a choice.

474
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:29,298
[SPEAKER_04]: They can continue taking courses offered by Medford High School, or they can participate in the independent study that Director Perry has created.

475
01:11:30,573 --> 01:11:40,085
[SPEAKER_04]: The independent study is a footnote at the bottom of the graduation requirement, as well as linked to a separate document for review.

476
01:11:42,148 --> 01:11:48,215
[SPEAKER_04]: The independent study, I don't know, would you like, I can explain it, I don't know if you want to explain the independent study.

477
01:11:48,235 --> 01:11:49,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

478
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:59,020
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, the independent study was created so that students would have some flexibility and be able to take some more courses within their day.

479
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:04,721
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of our students that do take things outside of school, dance, jujitsu, things like that.

480
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:15,083
[SPEAKER_22]: So I thought that was a great opportunity for us to count that as some credit, but in allow students to have some room in their schedule to take other electives that they could take.

481
01:12:15,843 --> 01:12:17,164
[SPEAKER_22]: So that was a great opportunity.

482
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:32,016
[SPEAKER_22]: And it also still allows us to offer some electives that students might want to continue taking some of the things we're thinking about is like a advanced nutrition course and athletic training course.

483
01:12:32,496 --> 01:12:36,519
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the things that I've been thinking about as well as maybe teaming up with our math

484
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:42,450
[SPEAKER_22]: department in doing an athletic statistics course where we can have students come out and work with our sports teams.

485
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:45,756
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's a lot of great things that we can do for electives as well.

486
01:12:46,882 --> 01:12:47,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

487
01:12:47,683 --> 01:12:57,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for the independent study students, after they've completed the four semesters of physical education courses through Medford High School, there are pathways that they can choose.

488
01:12:57,631 --> 01:13:13,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they are current athletes, that is one way that students that are enrolled in playing a Massachusetts interscholastic athletic association sanctioned sport would qualify them for the independent study per approval

489
01:13:13,884 --> 01:13:24,347
[SPEAKER_04]: and consultation with director Perry, as well as the opportunity for students that are in an instructionally based activity.

490
01:13:24,687 --> 01:13:40,752
[SPEAKER_04]: So dance, martial arts, things of that nature that would require also approval by Dr. Perry, the passing of the four previous courses and just a log from the instructor of those

491
01:13:41,769 --> 01:13:44,790
[SPEAKER_04]: fitness slash exercise programs?

492
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:51,593
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, this is something that we have done in the past as well for those students that were taking six majors.

493
01:13:51,613 --> 01:13:59,136
[SPEAKER_22]: So some of our students that wanted to double in math in their sophomore year, we did offer an independent study for those students as well.

494
01:13:59,176 --> 01:14:00,596
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's something we have done in the past.

495
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:03,898
[SPEAKER_22]: We're just really now opening it up to more students.

496
01:14:08,439 --> 01:14:08,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Any questions?

497
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:14,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for putting this together.

498
01:14:14,391 --> 01:14:16,833
[SPEAKER_23]: I really appreciate the increased flexibility.

499
01:14:17,013 --> 01:14:21,096
[SPEAKER_23]: When we saw this last time, there was also talk of independent studies for health.

500
01:14:21,176 --> 01:14:23,718
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm wondering what happened with those.

501
01:14:25,179 --> 01:14:30,522
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think what we can do for that piece would be to offer more health electives for students to take.

502
01:14:30,542 --> 01:14:37,207
[SPEAKER_23]: Would that count as part of the physical education independent study, or would those be their own independent electives?

503
01:14:37,267 --> 01:14:38,808
[SPEAKER_23]: That would be their own independent electives.

504
01:14:43,194 --> 01:14:46,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

505
01:14:46,595 --> 01:14:47,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for this.

506
01:14:48,075 --> 01:15:02,340
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this creates a lot of options which as you know like that's part of what we've been trying to do with this all of this schedule change is to is to open up the kind of options that students really have time to explore and

507
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:11,204
[SPEAKER_13]: get the academic support that they need along the way and the prior schedule just didn't allow for that across many different kinds of students.

508
01:15:12,785 --> 01:15:18,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I am really happy that we are sort of holding to our commitment to health education.

509
01:15:18,767 --> 01:15:27,972
[SPEAKER_13]: I certainly think we have room to do the same in middle school and sort of look at the rigor around our middle school curriculum.

510
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:37,458
[SPEAKER_13]: in many regards, but I think providing this kind of flexibility at the high school level is really important because that's really where there is so much opportunity.

511
01:15:37,638 --> 01:15:50,167
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think providing programming like athletic statistics and athletic training, like there's plenty of students who would really embrace that and it would back up the math teaching that is going on in the building as well.

512
01:15:50,267 --> 01:15:53,469
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think opening up the electives in general,

513
01:15:55,878 --> 01:15:57,660
[SPEAKER_13]: is just it's new and it's different.

514
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,883
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think there's so many possibilities.

515
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:09,693
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think especially when you can capture the attention of students in a thing that they're already passionate about, like you have so much more opportunity.

516
01:16:09,713 --> 01:16:14,979
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm really glad to hear about all of the elective offerings that this is allowing us to get to.

517
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:27,603
[SPEAKER_13]: because there is there are only so many hours in the day and they're really there are only so many teachers in the building and so creating some ways for us to be a little bit more creative is super important and exciting.

518
01:16:27,743 --> 01:16:29,784
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for doing all this work.

519
01:16:29,884 --> 01:16:38,467
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's like at the very last minute, but I think students starting next year will be really appreciative of the change.

520
01:16:38,547 --> 01:16:39,187
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

521
01:16:39,547 --> 01:16:39,867
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

522
01:16:44,973 --> 01:16:45,554
[SPEAKER_06]: member Russell.

523
01:16:47,476 --> 01:16:47,856
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

524
01:16:47,876 --> 01:16:56,304
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I especially like the, um part about students who do not pass the MCAS and a slightly off topic.

525
01:16:56,824 --> 01:17:04,691
[SPEAKER_19]: It's part of the policy, but, um, going back and getting those kids their diplomas is a big deal.

526
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:07,073
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just was, um, I see that

527
01:17:08,922 --> 01:17:14,410
[SPEAKER_19]: They wouldn't be students, they'd all be adults at this point, but that they can request this on our website.

528
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:21,520
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know where on the website that would be found, so maybe we could make that a little more obvious.

529
01:17:24,163 --> 01:17:28,267
[SPEAKER_19]: if we have students that are interested, I feel like we should do something for them.

530
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:35,974
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not students, they're all grown-ups, but if they want something and we can do something for them to make it feel special, I would be totally up for that.

531
01:17:35,994 --> 01:17:48,466
[SPEAKER_19]: 2003 is a long time ago to graduate, but I suspect that a lot of folks who would have received a diploma but did not and are now being told they can have one, like

532
01:17:50,089 --> 01:17:55,651
[SPEAKER_19]: probably a very bittersweet thing, but I think that if they're open to, if they want to do something, we should do something for them.

533
01:17:55,751 --> 01:17:59,672
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's not emotion, but just a thought.

534
01:18:00,313 --> 01:18:07,315
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, it really has always bothered me that they could pass all of the stuff we say, but still not get a diploma.

535
01:18:07,575 --> 01:18:14,758
[SPEAKER_19]: And can't really write that wrong from the perspective of how that affected their lives, but we can at least

536
01:18:17,028 --> 01:18:21,169
[SPEAKER_19]: give them a diploma and make it a big deal like it was for everybody else that went to graduation.

537
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:22,530
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

538
01:18:24,751 --> 01:18:25,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Lucy?

539
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:26,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

540
01:18:26,112 --> 01:18:38,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do know that our high school administrative staff and guidance department, school counseling department has been in touch with some previous students who are looking for their diploma.

541
01:18:38,918 --> 01:18:39,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I can have

542
01:18:40,318 --> 01:18:50,285
[SPEAKER_04]: a conversation about acknowledgement to your point, but I do know that we have received some requests and that those are being fulfilled as they come in.

543
01:18:50,405 --> 01:18:53,967
[SPEAKER_04]: So an acknowledgement is something that I can have a conversation about.

544
01:18:53,987 --> 01:18:55,007
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very nice idea.

545
01:18:55,728 --> 01:18:56,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

546
01:18:56,849 --> 01:18:57,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

547
01:18:57,129 --> 01:18:58,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor?

548
01:18:58,570 --> 01:18:59,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Brantley?

549
01:19:00,471 --> 01:19:00,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

550
01:19:01,391 --> 01:19:05,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know how many people, how many students it is or adults at this point, I should say?

551
01:19:06,573 --> 01:19:09,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't want to misspeak.

552
01:19:09,595 --> 01:19:14,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I know of two for sure, but I can get a firm number and let you all know.

553
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have to put a motion on the floor to have some sort of little soiree, or are we good?

554
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:21,564
[SPEAKER_05]: We can just have that in our own little fun time.

555
01:19:22,084 --> 01:19:22,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

556
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:23,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I like that.

557
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if they want one.

558
01:19:25,407 --> 01:19:26,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

559
01:19:26,568 --> 01:19:28,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

560
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:32,632
[SPEAKER_06]: By Member Ntukpa, seconded by Member Olopade.

561
01:19:33,113 --> 01:19:34,033
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

562
01:19:35,474 --> 01:19:36,155
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

563
01:19:37,425 --> 01:19:38,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo?

564
01:19:41,408 --> 01:19:42,549
[SPEAKER_19]: What's the second reading, right?

565
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we asked for adjustments, so this might be the first.

566
01:19:46,873 --> 01:19:48,554
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked for, yeah, adjustments.

567
01:19:48,574 --> 01:19:49,855
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first reading.

568
01:19:50,135 --> 01:19:50,736
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, the first reading.

569
01:19:50,876 --> 01:19:51,476
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thank you.

570
01:19:51,516 --> 01:19:52,817
[SPEAKER_19]: And who firsted and seconded?

571
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:55,940
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Member Ntapa and then seconded by Member Olopade.

572
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:56,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

573
01:19:57,281 --> 01:19:58,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And all those are in favor?

574
01:19:58,882 --> 01:19:59,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Any opposed?

575
01:20:00,683 --> 01:20:01,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

576
01:20:01,844 --> 01:20:03,225
[SPEAKER_06]: First reading has been approved.

577
01:20:07,826 --> 01:20:09,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Member Graham to waive the second reading.

578
01:20:10,808 --> 01:20:12,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld seconds.

579
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:13,791
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

580
01:20:14,391 --> 01:20:14,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

581
01:20:14,712 --> 01:20:15,452
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

582
01:20:18,315 --> 01:20:19,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Readings are waived.

583
01:20:20,116 --> 01:20:20,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

584
01:20:20,697 --> 01:20:24,840
[SPEAKER_04]: The high school counseling staff appreciates the expedition of that.

585
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:25,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

586
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:26,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

587
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:26,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

588
01:20:26,622 --> 01:20:27,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

589
01:20:35,012 --> 01:20:35,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

590
01:20:35,632 --> 01:20:38,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to our number eight, our budget amendment and vote.

591
01:20:38,893 --> 01:20:42,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to invite up Mr. Jerry McHugh, our budget analyst.

592
01:20:46,115 --> 01:20:48,796
[SPEAKER_06]: And Noel Ales.

593
01:21:00,519 --> 01:21:00,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

594
01:21:07,318 --> 01:21:21,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you school committee members and in your packet you have a reconciliation plan that was discussed at the time the budget was passed.

595
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:30,256
[SPEAKER_12]: It was certainly discussed at the City Council meeting as well.

596
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:41,012
[SPEAKER_12]: the school committee approved the budget last March based on the needs of the district.

597
01:21:44,073 --> 01:22:01,380
[SPEAKER_12]: The city was able to fund most of that and asked us to come up with a way to see if we can make some adjustments in order to align with the

598
01:22:04,184 --> 01:22:08,887
[SPEAKER_12]: that the mayor was able to submit to the City Council a few weeks ago.

599
01:22:10,868 --> 01:22:12,790
[SPEAKER_12]: So it relies on a few things.

600
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:18,253
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we have some funds from the question eight override.

601
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:29,141
[SPEAKER_12]: We have some revolving funds that are performing very well that we can transfer some positions to.

602
01:22:31,422 --> 01:22:41,024
[SPEAKER_12]: we were able to get a commitment from the city for a free cash appropriation to help with some of our capital needs.

603
01:22:43,445 --> 01:22:52,227
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we made several small moves so that we're still spending up to the level that the school committee approved.

604
01:22:53,487 --> 01:23:04,094
[SPEAKER_12]: back in May, but we've kind of made adjustments to the sources of revenue that can help fund those positions and expenses.

605
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:09,938
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, you know, the budget has to be monitored all the time.

606
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:12,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And when

607
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,101
[SPEAKER_12]: It's time to develop next year's budget.

608
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:17,543
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll take a look at all these moves.

609
01:23:17,683 --> 01:23:18,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Can they be sustained?

610
01:23:20,304 --> 01:23:22,486
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will continue to sustain them.

611
01:23:22,606 --> 01:23:32,211
[SPEAKER_12]: If they can't, we'll make some budget proposals to make sure we have sufficient funds to run Medford Public Schools.

612
01:23:34,893 --> 01:23:35,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

613
01:23:35,858 --> 01:23:36,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you both.

614
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:41,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know the free cash papers are on the city council agenda for tomorrow.

615
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:47,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we just need to get one more paper before the council there last meeting, which is in two weeks.

616
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:54,283
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, everything is under control for my office on the many papers we're trying to get to the council before the end of the fiscal year.

617
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,464
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's no questions, is there a motion for approval?

618
01:24:00,185 --> 01:24:00,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

619
01:24:00,665 --> 01:24:01,265
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

620
01:24:01,805 --> 01:24:02,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Russo, I think, was first.

621
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:04,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo, then Member Graham.

622
01:24:06,517 --> 01:24:06,917
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

623
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:23,696
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we've talked about a stable, the stabilization fund several times I just want to, I don't know what the accounting requirements are to make sure that really happens but I just want to make sure that all the teaser being crossed and eyes are being dotted so that we don't.

624
01:24:24,218 --> 01:24:24,418
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

625
01:24:24,438 --> 01:24:26,079
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't find out that there was like a July one.

626
01:24:26,199 --> 01:24:26,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh sorry.

627
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:31,423
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't do it by July one, so it can't happen till next time we have certified cash or something.

628
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,204
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to make sure that's happening.

629
01:24:33,845 --> 01:24:39,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we've been invited to City Council meeting tomorrow night, so I believe that, um.

630
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:40,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Part of the

631
01:24:52,693 --> 01:24:59,557
[SPEAKER_12]: The year closes and the year won't close possibly till August or September.

632
01:24:59,617 --> 01:25:08,202
[SPEAKER_12]: But the idea would be that we will have money in FY25 that we want to make available in FY26.

633
01:25:08,262 --> 01:25:17,367
[SPEAKER_12]: So there'll be a transfer from our FY25 budget into the stabilization fund in order to make that happen.

634
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:18,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

635
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:20,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham?

636
01:25:24,142 --> 01:25:24,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

637
01:25:25,923 --> 01:25:28,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for this reconciliation.

638
01:25:28,045 --> 01:25:38,152
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I just want to highlight some of the top line of this, which one is that the city increased its allocation to Medford Public Schools to 3%.

639
01:25:39,213 --> 01:25:47,979
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you to the mayor for the hard work that I and the sweat that I think it took to get there.

640
01:25:47,999 --> 01:25:49,020
[SPEAKER_06]: You're very pushy.

641
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,881
[SPEAKER_13]: You are very pushy.

642
01:25:53,547 --> 01:25:53,947
[SPEAKER_06]: We did it.

643
01:25:54,027 --> 01:25:54,448
[SPEAKER_06]: We did it.

644
01:25:54,528 --> 01:25:54,888
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good.

645
01:25:55,548 --> 01:25:57,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thank you very much for that.

646
01:25:57,849 --> 01:25:59,090
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's super important.

647
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:13,317
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, one of the things that if you look in the in the weeds of this, one of the things I'm most excited about is Miss Cabral from the high school has been talking about the need to create an alternative program at Medford High for two years now.

648
01:26:14,038 --> 01:26:14,178
[SPEAKER_13]: And

649
01:26:14,907 --> 01:26:18,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Among all of the things that have happened since we approved the budget.

650
01:26:19,893 --> 01:26:32,408
[SPEAKER_13]: We also collectively found funding for her to get that started and that will be really really critical particularly for some of our freshmen is is my understanding as they come up to the high school from the middle school.

651
01:26:33,268 --> 01:26:38,150
[SPEAKER_13]: to have increased academic support so that they can graduate on time.

652
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:43,772
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's a huge, it's a huge deal to be able to have this space to create this program.

653
01:26:44,512 --> 01:26:52,794
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that that wasn't, you know, that wasn't in the budget when we started so adding that sort of made things slightly worse in terms of reconciliation.

654
01:26:54,535 --> 01:26:58,157
[SPEAKER_13]: but we were able to to get there through any number of things.

655
01:26:58,217 --> 01:27:07,663
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll talk in just a few minutes about the MEEP line items as well because that came up and well that's I think next on our agenda.

656
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:14,327
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm just really happy that we were able to have a budget year without fanfare and I

657
01:27:15,087 --> 01:27:21,869
[SPEAKER_13]: do want to thank everybody who supported questions seven and eight because that is why we were able to have a budget without fanfare.

658
01:27:22,989 --> 01:27:35,853
[SPEAKER_13]: For those people who may be listening at home, I think the other important thing about the stabilization funds that we're talking about is those stabilization funds are being put into place because there are things that we will pay for in FY26 that

659
01:27:37,893 --> 01:27:42,839
[SPEAKER_13]: got going in some way, shape or form in FY 25, which is the reason we have to hold the money over.

660
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:55,854
[SPEAKER_13]: We also are continuing to negotiate with our bargaining partners, including the nurses and the paras and our maintenance team and our cafeteria staff.

661
01:27:56,054 --> 01:27:56,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And who am I missing?

662
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:00,694
[SPEAKER_13]: next year.

663
01:28:01,755 --> 01:28:06,896
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's still like four or five, four unions or so that we are working diligently with.

664
01:28:06,936 --> 01:28:09,297
[SPEAKER_13]: We had meetings earlier today with one of them.

665
01:28:09,997 --> 01:28:17,460
[SPEAKER_13]: And so all of that unknown means in all likelihood, those funds are going to need to be expended in FY26 instead of FY25.

666
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,461
[SPEAKER_13]: So the stabilization fund that will

667
01:28:20,341 --> 01:28:27,766
[SPEAKER_13]: go before the council to be created will just allow us the flexibility to do that without creating another crisis next year.

668
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:36,271
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think all of this is sort of thank you to the sound fiscal management that's happening at Medford Public Schools.

669
01:28:36,371 --> 01:28:38,412
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's a constant

670
01:28:39,373 --> 01:28:56,403
[SPEAKER_13]: constantly moving pile of quicksand when you look at the budget and the number of people and who, who is where and who's retiring and who's needs to come in and who you know how all of this fits together so I just think like you both have done a really really nice job.

671
01:28:57,203 --> 01:29:03,145
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we can boil down a meeting in June to one page, that's clear as day what's happening.

672
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:07,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we have made so many considerable strides in our finance office.

673
01:29:07,586 --> 01:29:09,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I'm really, really impressed.

674
01:29:09,407 --> 01:29:10,427
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you very much.

675
01:29:11,788 --> 01:29:14,789
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would make a motion to approve the budget as amended.

676
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:18,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rheingold.

677
01:29:20,519 --> 01:29:30,181
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to echo the thanks that has already been said and to note that I'm pleased that these adjustments do not include cuts to the arts and to mental health support.

678
01:29:30,321 --> 01:29:34,122
[SPEAKER_23]: I see some of those things have increased for the position needs here.

679
01:29:34,182 --> 01:29:40,463
[SPEAKER_23]: And so I want to call that out and say thank you, because those I think are really essential for the health of our community.

680
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:42,543
[SPEAKER_23]: And I will second the motion.

681
01:29:45,024 --> 01:29:47,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by member Reinfeld.

682
01:29:47,885 --> 01:29:50,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to roll call?

683
01:29:50,998 --> 01:29:51,598
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll call vote.

684
01:29:55,521 --> 01:29:56,102
[SPEAKER_19]: That means me.

685
01:29:57,903 --> 01:29:58,583
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Brantley.

686
01:30:00,965 --> 01:30:01,546
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, yes.

687
01:30:02,586 --> 01:30:05,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's your conflict, so you have to decide.

688
01:30:06,589 --> 01:30:08,731
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you wanna announce what your conflict is?

689
01:30:10,432 --> 01:30:11,353
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I do usually.

690
01:30:11,373 --> 01:30:14,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, so my sister is literacy coach here in the district.

691
01:30:14,735 --> 01:30:17,197
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother is a lunch monitor, so that covers me.

692
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:22,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And same before the roll is called, my sister works in the Metro Public Schools, so I'll also be abstaining.

693
01:30:24,818 --> 01:30:25,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call, please.

694
01:30:26,459 --> 01:30:26,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Graham.

695
01:30:27,239 --> 01:30:27,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

696
01:30:29,139 --> 01:30:29,780
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Atapa.

697
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

698
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:32,120
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Olopade.

699
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:32,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

700
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,941
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Rheinfeldt.

701
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:35,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

702
01:30:35,781 --> 01:30:36,781
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Rousseau, yes.

703
01:30:36,861 --> 01:30:38,421
[SPEAKER_19]: And Mayor Landau-Kern is abstaining.

704
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:39,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Abstaining, yes.

705
01:30:39,342 --> 01:30:41,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Five in favor, two abstaining.

706
01:30:41,642 --> 01:30:42,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper passes.

707
01:30:42,802 --> 01:30:43,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

708
01:30:43,983 --> 01:30:44,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

709
01:30:45,003 --> 01:30:45,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

710
01:30:46,990 --> 01:31:01,436
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not have any presentations of the public, but we do have continued business 2025-12 offered by member Reinfeld, whereas uneven distribution of students across the city's elementary schools has constrained Medford Public Schools ability to most effectively.

711
01:31:02,476 --> 01:31:03,957
[SPEAKER_06]: We've read it a couple times now.

712
01:31:03,997 --> 01:31:08,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this is space needs in the Medford Public Schools elementary.

713
01:31:08,619 --> 01:31:10,840
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's also our report from the subcommittee.

714
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:14,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

715
01:31:16,395 --> 01:31:17,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone second my wave reading.

716
01:31:17,856 --> 01:31:18,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

717
01:31:19,336 --> 01:31:22,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to waive the reading by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Graham.

718
01:31:22,597 --> 01:31:23,357
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

719
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:23,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

720
01:31:24,337 --> 01:31:25,297
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

721
01:31:25,477 --> 01:31:26,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Reading has been waived.

722
01:31:27,417 --> 01:31:28,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to turn it over to who?

723
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:28,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

724
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:31,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

725
01:31:31,698 --> 01:31:32,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

726
01:31:32,798 --> 01:31:41,260
[SPEAKER_13]: We did have a subcommittee meeting a few light years ago now, but actually on May 20th,

727
01:31:43,386 --> 01:31:49,291
[SPEAKER_13]: And during that meeting, Dr. Pelosi shared a presentation with us that provided all of this information.

728
01:31:49,331 --> 01:31:53,174
[SPEAKER_13]: It was linked in your packets for anybody who wants to take a deeper dive.

729
01:31:55,095 --> 01:32:02,581
[SPEAKER_13]: And we talked a little bit about the data and what the data was telling us across all of our elementary schools in particular.

730
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:09,927
[SPEAKER_13]: And we talked to, had a really interesting conversation about potential solutions, all of which,

731
01:32:11,309 --> 01:32:19,383
[SPEAKER_13]: are longer term than the immediate need that we have to make sure that we have space to welcome students in August.

732
01:32:20,064 --> 01:32:22,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Galluzzi also let us know that

733
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:36,954
[SPEAKER_13]: there will be a detailed space study happening in the district this summer to really sort of map out and lay out like our plan as we go forward when we look at our enrollment trends.

734
01:32:37,034 --> 01:32:45,981
[SPEAKER_13]: So now that we are looking at our enrollment trends in a formal way every year, it makes sense to say what, you know, how far into the future does this

735
01:32:46,882 --> 01:32:50,903
[SPEAKER_13]: particular plan hold and what are the possible solutions.

736
01:32:51,003 --> 01:32:54,044
[SPEAKER_13]: So that will be happening this year, this summer.

737
01:32:55,504 --> 01:33:14,890
[SPEAKER_13]: But we did make a couple of motions in subcommittee that I think that we should read out here and vote on as a larger committee because the Roberts right now is full and the question becomes like what do we do in order to

738
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:23,434
[SPEAKER_13]: alleviate that issue for August because the space study is not going to have those kinds of magical answers.

739
01:33:24,935 --> 01:33:36,142
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we had some public participation from members of the Roberts community as well as some of our other elementary communities and there were a couple of motions that came out of the minutes.

740
01:33:36,262 --> 01:33:40,985
[SPEAKER_13]: So, one was a motion to move to meet classrooms from the Roberts to the

741
01:33:44,987 --> 01:33:49,588
[SPEAKER_13]: and that was unanimously agreed to be voted out to this group.

742
01:33:51,448 --> 01:34:11,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Creating that space, so the Missittuck has space for those two classrooms, but creating two classrooms worth of space at the Roberts is pretty pivotal to what comes next, which was to request two additional FTEs at the Roberts to account for some of the bigger bubble classrooms that we have and there's

743
01:34:11,872 --> 01:34:15,314
[SPEAKER_13]: like more bubbles there on a continuous basis.

744
01:34:15,334 --> 01:34:17,375
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're probably not bubbles anymore.

745
01:34:17,396 --> 01:34:19,517
[SPEAKER_13]: They probably just started like sort of the way things are.

746
01:34:20,758 --> 01:34:26,541
[SPEAKER_13]: But those FTE counts were also in the budget that we just approved.

747
01:34:26,621 --> 01:34:28,923
[SPEAKER_13]: So that these have been accounted for as well.

748
01:34:30,406 --> 01:34:31,946
[SPEAKER_13]: That also passed unanimously.

749
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:45,869
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there was a third motion as amended to create a strategic space planning task force of staff and caregivers once the space utilization study is completed by the HMFH architects.

750
01:34:46,929 --> 01:34:48,690
[SPEAKER_13]: And that also passed unanimously.

751
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:54,551
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think the space study is going to be really important so that we know what options we have.

752
01:34:55,832 --> 01:35:00,835
[SPEAKER_13]: but then the real work will begin in terms of what does that mean in terms of change.

753
01:35:00,955 --> 01:35:13,343
[SPEAKER_13]: So having a task force of sorts of staff and caregivers to be part of that process as it unfolds in the late summer and early fall was another recommendation.

754
01:35:13,483 --> 01:35:21,308
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we should take a vote on those three and we can do it all together or we can do them one at a time.

755
01:35:21,328 --> 01:35:23,710
[SPEAKER_13]: We should do them separate, okay.

756
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:33,460
[SPEAKER_23]: And just to jump in, you mentioned the bubble, but to be really explicit about what that is, all but one grade at the Roberts next year will have five classrooms at that level.

757
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:40,101
[SPEAKER_23]: Everyone except the fifth graders, and that is where those new classrooms are needed.

758
01:35:40,222 --> 01:35:43,502
[SPEAKER_23]: And it also affects the ability to engage with specialists.

759
01:35:43,602 --> 01:35:52,165
[SPEAKER_23]: So you saw in the amended budget that one of those positions is a specialist teacher, so that everyone gets that access to those enrichment.

760
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:54,306
[SPEAKER_23]: academic experiences.

761
01:35:55,527 --> 01:35:57,229
[SPEAKER_13]: So do you want me to read the motions?

762
01:35:58,149 --> 01:35:58,650
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be great.

763
01:35:59,230 --> 01:35:59,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody.

764
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:01,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, sure.

765
01:36:01,272 --> 01:36:05,695
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

766
01:36:05,775 --> 01:36:07,076
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion is to move.

767
01:36:08,798 --> 01:36:11,980
[SPEAKER_19]: Meet that the two or the two other only to 22.

768
01:36:12,501 --> 01:36:18,025
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay to move to meet classrooms from the Roberts to the mistook beginning in August of 2025.

769
01:36:19,266 --> 01:36:20,327
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll make that motion.

770
01:36:22,107 --> 01:36:22,967
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll second it.

771
01:36:23,927 --> 01:36:29,649
[SPEAKER_23]: Member Graham.

772
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:32,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ntapa.

773
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:39,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mayor.

774
01:36:40,231 --> 01:36:41,191
[SPEAKER_15]: So quick question.

775
01:36:41,491 --> 01:36:44,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all for doing the work and trying to figure out this

776
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:51,005
[SPEAKER_15]: very large issue of space capacity that we have within the district.

777
01:36:51,386 --> 01:36:56,551
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was not able to attend the meeting and I didn't get a chance to watch it yet.

778
01:36:56,611 --> 01:36:58,232
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to ask a quick question.

779
01:36:58,592 --> 01:37:01,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Was there a specific reason as to why the Missituck was chosen?

780
01:37:01,996 --> 01:37:03,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it just because of the space?

781
01:37:03,797 --> 01:37:11,745
[SPEAKER_23]: The Missituck was the only school that didn't have space constraints and had classrooms available with bathrooms for the preschool level.

782
01:37:12,205 --> 01:37:31,271
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wasn't sure, because I know we have a good amount of, I believe, services going on at the Mississippi, so I just wanted to make sure that that wouldn't cause an issue of introducing another, like, again, just wanted to cover all bases because I just don't want it to, I just want to make sure that that was accounted for, and also the fact that those folks were consulted on that decision.

783
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:33,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Galluzzi as well.

784
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:35,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, I can clarify that.

785
01:37:37,735 --> 01:37:51,446
[SPEAKER_04]: First, if we're just looking at enrollment, as Member Reinfeldt stated, the Mississippi is the only school right now without constraints regarding enrollment as well as programming.

786
01:37:53,397 --> 01:37:54,999
[SPEAKER_04]: We had moved previously.

787
01:37:55,019 --> 01:38:07,349
[SPEAKER_04]: The McGlynn School, I think it's important to note, the McGlynn School may not have the enrollment capacity issues that the Brooks or the Roberts has, but the McGlynn does have some space constraints.

788
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:09,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the only elementary school with three floors.

789
01:38:10,592 --> 01:38:12,573
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other elementary schools have four floors.

790
01:38:13,234 --> 01:38:21,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So by removing a whole entire floor of options, they may not have the enrollment capacity, but they definitely have a space one.

791
01:38:22,039 --> 01:38:24,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So two things have happened.

792
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:29,843
[SPEAKER_04]: One, at the McGlynn, there is a need for an additional access classroom next year.

793
01:38:30,344 --> 01:38:32,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to increase in that area.

794
01:38:33,795 --> 01:38:44,043
[SPEAKER_04]: When Mr. Teixeira created the additional strand of newcomer that also was at the McGlynn, that's five classrooms right there.

795
01:38:47,085 --> 01:38:55,311
[SPEAKER_04]: At that time, or around that time, the MEEP program that was at the McGlynn was relocated to the Mesituc.

796
01:38:56,012 --> 01:38:59,314
[SPEAKER_04]: So the McGlynn for the past, Ms.

797
01:38:59,334 --> 01:39:01,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Bowen, two, three years has not had a MEEP program.

798
01:39:03,168 --> 01:39:15,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So it also creates a nice opportunity for a little bit more collaboration, because right now there'll just be two schools with MEEP programming.

799
01:39:16,054 --> 01:39:27,499
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that we did see is our work with Mr. McHugh and Mr. Velez and Mr. Texera is that next year for our newcomer program in grade five, we don't need to

800
01:39:28,532 --> 01:39:30,233
[SPEAKER_04]: fifth grade newcomer classrooms.

801
01:39:30,933 --> 01:39:39,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So it will just be at the McGlynn and that fifth grade at the Missituck also creates yet another classroom space that is available.

802
01:39:40,879 --> 01:39:57,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now you will, for next year, 25, 26, you will have two or three MEEP classrooms at the Brooks, two MEEP classrooms at the Brooks, and then the remaining at the Missituck, I believe it's now four, five,

803
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:11,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome, yeah, no, I think what I'm pulling from is, I believe it was, while we're talking about budget cycles, last budget cycle, the Missittuck came up quite a bit just because while there is lower enrollment in certain areas, there are higher needs.

804
01:40:11,842 --> 01:40:24,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that's why I sort of was curious if folks from the Missittuck were consulted with, how much disruption, not disruption, but how much bringing it in would cause, but if that has been considered then.

805
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:27,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I think it's important to note, so Ms.

806
01:40:27,101 --> 01:40:37,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Bowen did go over and have meetings with staff, there was outreach to caregivers, and I think that's very valid.

807
01:40:37,570 --> 01:40:44,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Every elementary school has specialized programming under special education.

808
01:40:45,757 --> 01:40:55,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say those vary in regard to need, those vary in regard to support and resource, as well as enrollment.

809
01:40:56,340 --> 01:41:01,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a need for sure at the Missituck, just as there is at the Roberts.

810
01:41:02,902 --> 01:41:13,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I think part of that data that I presented at the subcommittee meeting showed that, so the Roberts specialized programming, the Connections program is quite large.

811
01:41:14,445 --> 01:41:16,766
[SPEAKER_04]: and actually growing each year.

812
01:41:16,786 --> 01:41:19,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe they're up to five classrooms, five classrooms.

813
01:41:20,587 --> 01:41:29,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And the therapeutic learning program at the Missittuck definitely has student need as they all do, but there are three classrooms.

814
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:34,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's also just a matter of space and availability.

815
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:35,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

816
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:36,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

817
01:41:36,411 --> 01:41:38,152
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure this all was answered in the meeting.

818
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:40,672
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just not something I had a chance to look at yet.

819
01:41:40,692 --> 01:41:41,913
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to ask it on the floor.

820
01:41:42,053 --> 01:41:42,533
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

821
01:41:42,553 --> 01:41:43,193
[SPEAKER_06]: That's understandable.

822
01:41:45,308 --> 01:41:45,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

823
01:41:45,809 --> 01:41:47,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham and Member Reinfeldt.

824
01:41:47,374 --> 01:41:50,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just ready to vote.

825
01:41:50,863 --> 01:41:51,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

826
01:41:56,427 --> 01:42:12,572
[SPEAKER_23]: I was just also going to say one of the things, not to rehash the entire meeting because I think it is worth looking at the presentation and the recap, but is that one of the things we're thinking about with the new that came up was the new high school is looking to have early childhood because there are programs like that in the building.

827
01:42:12,592 --> 01:42:16,653
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a unique opportunity with MSBA to grow MEAP-like programs.

828
01:42:17,753 --> 01:42:18,694
[SPEAKER_23]: for the whole district.

829
01:42:18,834 --> 01:42:35,601
[SPEAKER_23]: And so this meeting was a really interesting balance of the short-term fixing the challenges that are directly affecting next year's ability to really stay above water and looking at the long-term solutions.

830
01:42:35,681 --> 01:42:44,365
[SPEAKER_23]: And so early childhood, we had an interesting discussion around that in the context of both the new high school and what all the schools have to offer, as Dr. Galussi said.

831
01:42:51,157 --> 01:42:51,958
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

832
01:42:53,178 --> 01:42:53,899
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

833
01:42:54,339 --> 01:42:55,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

834
01:42:58,001 --> 01:42:58,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo?

835
01:42:58,722 --> 01:42:59,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

836
01:42:59,342 --> 01:43:00,843
[SPEAKER_19]: The next one is the motion.

837
01:43:01,003 --> 01:43:03,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we need to motion to request?

838
01:43:03,725 --> 01:43:04,345
[SPEAKER_19]: We already did that.

839
01:43:04,365 --> 01:43:06,206
[SPEAKER_19]: We've already approved that, sorry.

840
01:43:06,286 --> 01:43:12,630
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion is, excuse me, as amended.

841
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:16,052
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't have the language of the unamended, but I'll find that.

842
01:43:18,615 --> 01:43:28,127
[SPEAKER_19]: is to create a strategic space planning task force of staff and caregivers once our space utilization study is completed by HMFH Architects.

843
01:43:29,268 --> 01:43:30,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Oliver, motion that?

844
01:43:32,933 --> 01:43:33,173
[SPEAKER_19]: I did.

845
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:38,920
[SPEAKER_06]: that we do a space needs study with the architects?

846
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:39,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you said?

847
01:43:39,601 --> 01:43:43,302
[SPEAKER_23]: So the space study is commissioned for the summer to happen.

848
01:43:43,402 --> 01:43:50,324
[SPEAKER_23]: And then once that data is in, it falls to the district to analyze and say, all right, what are we going to do with this?

849
01:43:50,344 --> 01:43:53,564
[SPEAKER_23]: Does this mean we're restructuring the grade levels at different schools?

850
01:43:53,584 --> 01:43:57,446
[SPEAKER_23]: Does this mean we're changing how kindergarten enrollment happens?

851
01:43:57,586 --> 01:43:59,626
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it changing districting?

852
01:44:00,026 --> 01:44:06,488
[SPEAKER_23]: It's to explore those longer term solutions with the data about what our buildings can handle.

853
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:07,970
[SPEAKER_23]: Got it.

854
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:08,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

855
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:11,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't hear Member Rousseau, so that's why I wanted clarification.

856
01:44:11,471 --> 01:44:13,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so there's a motion on the floor.

857
01:44:13,711 --> 01:44:15,472
[SPEAKER_06]: It's to create a task force.

858
01:44:15,612 --> 01:44:24,694
