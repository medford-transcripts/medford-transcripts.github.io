Is there a motion on the floor?

36
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:43,777
And if I could ask from the chair, if you could just sever the special meeting of the Committee of the Whole, June 3rd, 2025, to take that separately.

Member Reinfeldt, did you?

41
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:08,425
No, I was asking if we need to sever the strategic and capital planning subcommittee because we're discussing it later.

42
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:10,186
That's up to you all.

43
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:13,669
Okay, so motion to approve.

44
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:15,050

I'm just gonna mark myself as opposed.

51
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:55,682
I have not read the meeting minutes yet.

52
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:57,983
So all those in favor?

53
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:00,938
One opposed, motion passes.

54
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,262
Reports of subcommittees, there are none.

55
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,386
Then we have multiple reports from our superintendent.

56
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:16,654
First up, recognition of and performance by the Middle School Orchestra MICCA Gold Medal Rating.

57
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:19,077
I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Galluzzi.

58
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:20,958
Thank you so much.

59
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:24,579
This is an evening that just warms my heart completely.

60
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:37,681
So first and foremost, I want to say thank you to the students and the caregivers, to family members and friends, to Director Sophia Chang for joining us this evening.

61
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:45,303
While we wish that you could play for the whole entire night and before every meeting, we're gathered here to celebrate your accomplishments.

62
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:48,104
that you achieved earlier this spring.

63
00:11:48,865 --> 00:12:08,236
So this past April, the Middle School String Ensemble was awarded a gold medal at the 2025 Massachusetts Instrumental and Choral Conductors Association Concert Festival, a deserving award that reflects a tremendous amount of dedication of the students and staff members.

64
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:09,857
So thank you to

65
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,859
Fine Arts Director, Ms.

66
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,942
Fee, very talented Orchestra and Sing Ensemble Director, Ms.

67
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:27,710
Sophia Chang, and all the other staff members for creating this pathway for our students and for making sure that we have opportunities in the arts for our students here in Medford.

68
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,652
We're very, very proud of your accomplishments.

69
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:34,715
And so at this time, we have so many accomplishments this evening.

70
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,677
What I'm going to do is invite Director Chang,

71
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,114
Are they playing for us?

72
00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:41,295
Would you like to?

73
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:48,821
So tonight they are going to play for you a jazz piece which they just learned a few weeks ago, three, four weeks ago.

74
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,703
And they are going to play without a conductor.

75
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:54,405
And I'd like to thank all of you.

76
00:12:55,285 --> 00:13:03,932
The result is the hard work from all the students and the continued support from administrators and parents.

77
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:05,353
So enjoy it.

78
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:42,756
Okay.

79
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:21,097

80
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:54,906

Thank you, Ms.

89
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:31,723
Chang.

90
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:34,925
Yes, we do have some certificates for the students.

91
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,087
I appreciate you acknowledging them.

92
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:39,729
Could we maybe pause for a picture with them?

93
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:40,910
Should we go over there?

94
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,432
I think it would be easier if we go to them for this one, yes.

95
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:43,632
Thank you.

96
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:58,223
Closer, closer, closer.

97
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:02,760
Professor, we are going to take photo.

98
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:05,022
Stand in front of your chair.

99
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:08,826
I always drop something.

100
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,356
Oh, that's a good idea.

101
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:40,255
Should we move this out of the way?

102
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,374
You have to stand closer, please.

103
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:04,134
Stand closer.

104
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:11,176
I stand in front of Eric, because I always do.

105
00:20:11,196 --> 00:20:21,858
Ben, if you make me fall, I'll make the fall on you.

106
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:30,490
Okay.

107
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:30,611
Okay.

108
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:18,652
and you scare me.

109
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:20,693
You have no idea.

110
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:14,172
Elia?

111
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,473
I don't know what Elia is.

112
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:15,993
Oh, Elia.

113
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,654
Yeah, you vaguer?

114
00:22:17,674 --> 00:22:17,794
No.

115
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:18,734
I see a bracelet.

116
00:22:18,774 --> 00:22:24,196
Hey, your sweatshirt.

117
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:27,057
I don't know what that is.

118
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:33,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

119
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:54,823
Okay.

120
00:22:54,843 --> 00:22:55,564
Thank you.

121
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:55,050
Oh, mamma mia.

122
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:53,338
OK.

123
00:24:56,902 --> 00:24:57,783
Thank you for being here.

124
00:24:57,803 --> 00:25:00,605
A lot of athletes in the room.

125
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:04,909
Next up, we have the recognition of e-sports.

126
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:09,113
I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Suzanne B. Galluzzi, our intern superintendent.

127
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:11,132
Thank you.

128
00:25:11,312 --> 00:25:12,492
This is very exciting.

129
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,132
Round two.

130
00:25:13,193 --> 00:25:13,813
Here we go.

131
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:36,697
Congratulations to all the students, the parents, the caregivers, the two coaches, Mr. McCready, Mr. Maldonado, and everyone that was involved in the Medford High School Mario Kart team, which won the 2025 Spring Massachusetts School Administrators Association Mario Kart Championship.

132
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:38,459
which is a very big deal.

133
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:53,537
So the victory by our Moomoo Meadows Mustangs eSports team at Fisher College earlier this year marked the first ever MSAA state championship for our eSports team.

134
00:25:54,598 --> 00:26:03,700
With our program being so new to the Medford High School community, it's really amazing to see how well they have done in such a short amount of time.

135
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:13,343
So much camaraderie, spirit, teamwork, and ultimate success is really something to be acknowledged and appreciated.

136
00:26:13,423 --> 00:26:16,564
So a round of applause for our esports team.

137
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:38,101
At this time, and we're going to do this for all of the acknowledgements this evening, we'll have the coaches come to the rail, they'll say a few words, and then they'll read the students' names.

138
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:45,084
We'll take a team group photo, and then certificates will go to the coaches for dissemination to the team.

139
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:50,567
Okay, so at this moment, I'd like to ask Mr. McCready and Mr. Maldonado to come on up.

140
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:53,538
Thank you so much.

141
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,180
I just wanted to say thank you to everyone.

142
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:12,328
Esports started up about four years ago, and just to see how far the kids have come with the program, and just the community has been awesome, a huge support, and just the fact that this is very important to the students, and really just their education.

143
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:13,709
So I can't thank you enough.

144
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:22,614
We're lucky to have four teams at Medford High, and the winning coach, Mr. McCready, is gonna go ahead and read the students' names.

145
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:28,856
So for our Mario Kart team, we have Richard Torella.

146
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:36,839
We got Lawrence Gilmore.

147
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:41,400
You want to stand up?

148
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:43,181
Jalen Richardson.

149
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:45,742
Stand up.

150
00:27:46,222 --> 00:27:47,122
You want to stand up?

151
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:49,943
Stand up when your name's called so we know that you're up.

152
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,644
Thank you.

153
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:55,205
Nobi Ashihara.

154
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:58,903
Roughing our trophy as well.

155
00:28:00,964 --> 00:28:02,905
Echo Valdez-Melga, our captain.

156
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:07,707
Juan Tapia.

157
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:13,069
And last but not least, Justin Lara.

158
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:18,432
That's all, thank you.

159
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:21,473
Thank you so much.

160
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:29,131
Thank you, so we're going to ask everyone to come in the center, the team and the coaches for a quick photo.

161
00:28:29,151 --> 00:28:49,106
Yeah, you're gonna back up a little bit, back up a little bit.

162
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:43,362
Congratulations again.

163
00:29:45,022 --> 00:29:52,387
Next up we have the recognition of winter spring GBL champions and individual athletic achievements, Dr. Lucy.

164
00:29:53,087 --> 00:29:53,587
Thank you.

165
00:29:54,107 --> 00:30:02,072
This will be a little bit of a longer one, but I'm going to call Director Rachel Perry up to the podium I just want to introduce as she's kind of walking up.

166
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:10,062
Thank you.

167
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:28,020
Before I pass it to you, I just do want to give a shout out to all the students, the caregivers, the coaches, everyone that is here tonight and throughout the whole two seasons that we're acknowledging this evening for your dedication to the team, to the sport, to your preparation.

168
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:32,185
It takes a lot of work and we're really tremendously proud of you and your success.

169
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:37,161
Tonight we are acknowledging in the fall, we acknowledge the fall sports.

170
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:39,883
And so tonight we are acknowledging winter and spring.

171
00:30:41,064 --> 00:30:52,313
There were 14 different sports, one, the GBL, which I know director Perry is going to acknowledge and or a regional event.

172
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,455
So tremendous accomplishments.

173
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:55,656
We're all very proud of you.

174
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:59,419
Now without further ado, same scenario.

175
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:01,221
So you'll go sport by sport.

176
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:02,602
Okay, thank you.

177
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:03,691
Thank you.

178
00:31:04,353 --> 00:31:07,680
Good evening, Mayor Longo Kern, Dr. Galluzzi, and members of the school committee.

179
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:13,433
I am honored to be here tonight to recognize our amazing athletic achievements for the winter and spring seasons.

180
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:20,969
Our athletes dedicate themselves in the classroom and in the athletic arena, working hard day in and day out.

181
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:26,854
I'd like to thank our athletes and our coaches for their commitment and dedication to Mustang athletics.

182
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:36,382
Tonight we will recognize GBL champions, record holders, and students that will compete or have competed in national competitions.

183
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:37,263
Thank you.

184
00:31:38,812 --> 00:31:43,638
First, I'd like to recognize Cooper Sue, who could not be here with us tonight.

185
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:52,228
Unfortunately, they have their track banquet, but he actually competed in the Nike Nationals in the hurdles over the winter in New York.

186
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:54,611
So that was a great accomplishment for Cooper.

187
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:58,095
We have a certificate for him that will present him at school tomorrow.

188
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:10,400
The next team up is our gymnastics GBL championship team.

189
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,928
I'm going to call up Coach Fortino and Coach Corrigan.

190
00:32:28,472 --> 00:32:29,112
Thank you so much.

191
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:32,455
A little story about our gymnastics team.

192
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:33,816
We are very small, but mighty.

193
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:35,937
And I've won for the past three years.

194
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:41,061
So I'd like to recognize Captain Alex Lombardo.

195
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,685
Captain Jocelyn Barrugo.

196
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:49,526
Jocelyn.

197
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:53,729
Elsa Mara.

198
00:32:57,972 --> 00:32:58,934
And Ariana Ramos.

199
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:09,188
Thank you.

200
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:10,771
Director Perry, do we want to come on?

201
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:11,832
Yes, thank you.

202
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:33,891
All right, everybody.

203
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:18,586
Thank you and congratulations.

204
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:23,488
The next team up, we have ice hockey coach, Ned O'Keefe.

205
00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:28,709
I'm just gonna ask everyone to hold applause till we read all the names and you can clock in.

206
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:29,249
Thank you.

207
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,130
Thank you.

208
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,730
Thank you, everybody.

209
00:34:35,131 --> 00:34:39,752
Thank you, school committee, Mayor Brianna, Suzanne Galluzzi, Rachel, everyone.

210
00:34:39,772 --> 00:34:44,153
I appreciate being recognized for, congratulate everyone on all the sports.

211
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,351
It's good for the kids to have this, you know?

212
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:53,795
So I said a while back about standing up at high, and we love the fact that all of these kids go to the high school who live here.

213
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,036
Okay, for the hockey team, graded Boston League champions.

214
00:34:57,056 --> 00:35:00,078
We're a six and O, 10 and 10 overall.

215
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,899
It's my first year as the head coach.

216
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,660
It was a learning experience.

217
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,982
I've been involved with the program for about 15 years, but plan on being back.

218
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:10,263
I love it, and I love the kids.

219
00:35:10,343 --> 00:35:11,384
I had five seniors.

220
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:12,985
I'm just gonna say everyone's name here.

221
00:35:14,418 --> 00:35:39,892

Thank you.

223
00:36:07,418 --> 00:36:09,160
We're definitely all hockey boys, aren't you?

224
00:36:12,285 --> 00:36:18,414
We're going to have to squeeze in a little bit more.

225
00:36:18,775 --> 00:36:22,100
There you go.

226
00:36:53,058 --> 00:36:55,161
So we're going to stand when our name is called, right?

227
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:55,822
Yes.

228
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:57,444
Stand when your name is called.

229
00:36:59,006 --> 00:36:59,427
Thank you.

230
00:36:59,447 --> 00:37:00,969
Congratulations, boys hockey.

231
00:37:01,029 --> 00:37:08,260
Next, moving on to spring, we have our greater Boston League champion baseball team, Coach Horacio Azarello.

232
00:37:16,798 --> 00:37:17,518
Thank you very much.

233
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:21,380
I just want to say congratulations to all the GBL champions.

234
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,141
What a year for Medford High School.

235
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:25,242
It's great to be a Mustang, I'll tell you that much.

236
00:37:27,003 --> 00:37:31,986
Medford baseball, we won the GBL this year first time in 10 years.

237
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:33,526
So that was a great accomplishment.

238
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:38,989
Made the tournament and upset Brookline first time in seven years for Medford.

239
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:44,192
So I'm very proud of this group and they definitely deserve this night for them.

240
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:44,892
Thank you very much.

241
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:52,198

Ethan Ramsey, Jaron Sanchez, John Wright, Colin O'Keefe, Dom Branley, Owen Regan, and Quinn Natale.

254
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:33,667
Thank you very much.

255
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:55,401
Back up a little more for me guys.

256
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:32,154
All right, Mr. Patel is going to get one more.

257
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:30,218
Thank you.

258
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:40,144
Next, we have our Greater Boston League undefeated GVL champs, our softball team, Coach Jackie Pelechia.

259
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:54,065
Hey, everyone.

260
00:40:54,105 --> 00:40:56,046
Thank you for allowing us to be here today.

261
00:40:56,066 --> 00:41:07,531
Our team finished the season undefeated in the GBL and 18 and 2 overall, making it through the first round of states and losing in the second round to the number two team in the state.

262
00:41:08,491 --> 00:41:11,833
We have a young team, so we're coming back next year with the same fight.

263
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:23,278
First, I'd like to recognize Ruby Andreasen, Grace Anzalone, Jamie Anzalone, Jacqueline Branley,

Next, we have our Greater Boston League undefeated champions, girls lacrosse coach, Pasa Cantilli.

267
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:38,571
Thank you so much for having us here tonight.

268
00:43:38,851 --> 00:43:40,592
We had a really incredible season.

269
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:44,195
We made it to the state tournament for the first time in 10 years.

270
00:43:44,675 --> 00:43:49,139
We were named league champs for the first time in nine years and undefeated in the league.

271
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:55,244
We were also undefeated at home and we broke the program record for most amount of wins in a season.

272
00:43:56,024 --> 00:44:01,609
My roster includes Riley Allen, Aaron Alves, Kaitlyn Alves,

273
00:44:02,345 --> 00:44:20,196
Tatum Boudreaux, Becky Casey, Sienna Fossey, McKenna Galuzzo, Jordan Godfrey, Sophia Ishmael, Ava Lavoie, Mia Leal, Leah Marino, Lily Morris, Gia Russo, and Georgia Scott.

274
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:43,311
That's how I do it.

275
00:45:46,965 --> 00:45:54,128
And next we have our greater Boston League undefeated champions boys lacrosse, Anthony to Torah.

276
00:46:03,711 --> 00:46:04,632
Thank you for inviting us.

277
00:46:05,992 --> 00:46:06,312
As Ms.

278
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:11,975
Perry said, we finished 8-0 in league play and 14-4 with our regular schedule.

279
00:46:12,255 --> 00:46:16,577
We also finished in the top 32 of Division I in all of the state.

280
00:46:17,718 --> 00:46:20,079
But I would like to congratulate the whole team.

281
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:30,144
Hayden Butler, James Camuso, Vinny Castro, Carter Cherone, Edwin Shirelli?

282
00:46:30,184 --> 00:46:31,544
Did I pronounce that right?

283
00:46:32,465 --> 00:46:32,845
Yeah, I don't know.

284
00:46:35,344 --> 00:46:55,664
Patrick Converse, Lucas Dias-Golden, Gabe Kennedy, Milo Liu, Anthony Mattarisi, James Montello, Jeremy Morris, Nicholas Morris, Reed Bassini, Alex Pinto, Joe Russo, Josh Santos, Cooper Hsu, Nathan Tremlett, and Ben Tuco.

285
00:48:11,703 --> 00:48:20,567
I'd also like to recognize one of our athletes who had a phenomenal senior year on the football field, on the basketball court, and on the baseball field.

286
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:25,630
He couldn't be here with us tonight, but Justin Marino scored 1,000 points in his career.

287
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:28,091
So congratulations, Justin.

288
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:29,732
We'll get his certificate to him.

289
00:48:33,394 --> 00:48:33,694
Thank you.

290
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:47,980
And next, I am going to call up Coach Stavros for our crew team, who will be talking about the season and acknowledging our athletes that will be participating in nationals this week in Florida.

291
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,021
Coach Stavros.

292
00:48:58,593 --> 00:48:59,674
Thank you, school committee.

293
00:48:59,814 --> 00:49:03,016
Thank you, Rachel, for your support over the years.

294
00:49:03,757 --> 00:49:09,500
This was an interesting season for us coming off last fall's state championship sculling.

295
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:14,824
At this year's state sculling, it got eliminated because of high waters and wind.

296
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,185
So we didn't have a chance to capture that.

297
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:21,068
But we were able to capture the second varsity four

298
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:32,333
a bronze medal, and the four kids that were in that boat will be heading to the nationals to represent us in the youth under 17 double sculling.

299
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:40,203
And that is Jaden Wu, Owen Bacaracro, Adam Cezars, and Henry Gregoire.

300
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:17,677
Thank you.

301
00:50:17,777 --> 00:50:25,162
Oh, my bad.

302
00:51:03,882 --> 00:51:05,266
Thank you all for joining us tonight.

303
00:51:05,326 --> 00:51:06,309
Congratulations.

304
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:09,277
Keep up the hard work, and we can't wait to see you here again next year.

305
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,323
Unless you're going to college, then kill it there too.

306
00:52:22,997 --> 00:52:37,746
I have some citations.

307
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:51,274
Thank you, everybody.

308
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:53,000
Great first hour for us.

309
00:52:54,763 --> 00:53:00,950
Next up we have recognition of our retiring staff members with over 20 years of service to the Medford public schools.

310
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,153
I'm going to turn it over again to Dr. Lucy.

311
00:53:04,395 --> 00:53:05,276
Thank you so much.

312
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:10,622
This is a very special acknowledgement for Medford public schools but also from

313
00:53:11,718 --> 00:53:12,198
for myself.

314
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:34,449
I know not everybody was able to be here tonight, but we really wanted to make sure to use this time to give special recognition to five Medford Public Schools employees who are retiring at the end of the school year and whom have each given at least more than 20 years of service to our students and our school communities.

315
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:40,052
And that is very significant and really needs to be acknowledged and celebrated.

316
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:50,366
So each of these five individuals have impacted hundreds, if not thousands of students during their time here and throughout their job roles.

317
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:59,257
And we really want to thank them for everything they have done for their school communities and making it a better place and making our students feel warm and welcomed.

318
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:04,539
We wish you all the best in the next chapter of your life.

319
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,385
We know you're going to be going on to do other things, but we really wish you all the best.

320
00:54:09,925 --> 00:54:15,472
And on behalf of the Metro Public Schools community, we wish you congratulations on your retirement.

321
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:28,819
So I know not everyone was able to be here, but I still would like to acknowledge the five names, and then we'll call the two members up for their certificate from Mayor Burke.

322
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:29,480
Oh, excuse me.

323
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,200
I'm so sorry.

324
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,481
Mayor Langer-Kern.

325
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:35,283
I didn't know if you wanted to say anything or if you want to.

326
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:41,608
No, I believe we have two people here that have put in, Ms.

327
00:54:41,628 --> 00:54:46,230
Gomez, you've put in 32 years for public schools, and Ms.

328
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,790
Breen, 25 years.

329
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:50,992
And I know you're joined by your family because that's pretty extraordinary.

330
00:54:51,492 --> 00:54:59,616
And like Dr. Galluzzi said, and I speak for the committee, thank you for everything you've done for our school system and for our students.

331
00:55:00,116 --> 00:55:00,876
We appreciate it.

332
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:04,158
We wish you the best of luck in your next chapter.

333
00:55:04,672 --> 00:55:08,916
in your future, I'm sure you'll still go out and do great things and have some time with your family.

334
00:55:09,997 --> 00:55:12,760
So thank you for everything on behalf of myself and the school committee.

335
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:31,545
And we'll call you up in just one moment, but I do want to acknowledge, we also have Karen Roberto, a school nurse who gave us 25 years of service.

336
00:55:32,026 --> 00:55:39,010
We have Jana Ewing, a second grade classroom teacher at the McGlynn, who gave us 34 years of service.

337
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:45,373
And to Mary Hordy, who was a physical education teacher, 30 years of service.

338
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:47,835
And at this time, we have, oh yeah, thank you.

339
00:56:00,876 --> 00:56:01,437
You want to speak?

340
00:56:01,457 --> 00:56:03,038
You take a picture?

341
00:56:03,378 --> 00:56:03,779
Yes, go ahead.

342
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:09,683
We're just going to get the microphone on.

343
00:56:09,863 --> 00:56:10,704
There's a red button.

344
00:56:12,906 --> 00:56:13,606
There's a button.

345
00:56:13,867 --> 00:56:14,187
Got it.

346
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:15,007
I think it's on.

347
00:56:15,027 --> 00:56:15,908
Somebody else pressed it.

348
00:56:15,948 --> 00:56:17,169
Well, thank you so much.

349
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,910
I really appreciate it.

350
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:24,675
I literally didn't know why I was being invited to the school committee meeting.

351
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:27,537
I kind of figured it out, but my daughter's here, so it's wonderful.

352
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:36,344
So when I first started as a school counselor at the Dame, I was the only school counselor.

353
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:38,545
There were no school psychologists.

354
00:56:38,585 --> 00:56:40,226
There were no behaviorists.

355
00:56:40,786 --> 00:56:42,988
And I was the only one for 10 years.

356
00:56:43,148 --> 00:56:45,369
And then I started at the Brooks.

357
00:56:45,889 --> 00:56:49,791
Again, I was the only mental health person at that school.

358
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:54,274
And now there are four full-time mental health staff

359
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:55,817
at the school.

360
00:56:55,917 --> 00:57:04,363
So it just shows you how the field has changed and how much need we have for mental health services in the public schools.

361
00:57:04,603 --> 00:57:12,329
So I've loved it, and I'm going to be very sad, but 32 years, so I guess I can do something else now.

362
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,190
It's my job.

363
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:13,670
Thank you.

364
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:14,071
Thanks.

365
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:41,854
I know.

366
00:57:41,894 --> 00:57:42,395
Congratulations.

367
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,048
Bye.

368
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:47,081
Thank you again.

369
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:54,165
We also have two additional people moving on, Dr. Cushing and Paul Texera.

370
00:58:54,185 --> 00:58:59,108
So I'm going to turn it again over to Dr. Galluzzi to start us off.

371
00:58:59,968 --> 00:59:01,009
Thank you so much.

372
00:59:01,729 --> 00:59:06,712
So I would like to have Dr. Cushing and Mr. Paul Texera come

373
00:59:07,692 --> 00:59:08,453
to the podium.

374
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,255
I just have a few words that I would like to say.

375
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:16,919
And then I know that there are some members of the school committee that would also like to say a few words.

376
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:31,429
So I know we've said this before at school committee meetings, but both Dr. Cushing and both Mr. Texera are leaving Medford Public Schools for superintendencies.

377
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,991
Dr. Cushing will, yes,

378
00:59:39,998 --> 00:59:48,550
Dr. Cushing is the next superintendent for Beverly Public Schools, and Mr. Teixeira is the next superintendent for Provincetown Public School.

379
00:59:51,257 --> 01:00:19,170
So first, I just want to acknowledge, so for Peter, Dr. Cushing, we sincerely thank you for your six years of dedicated service to Metro Public Schools, to your commitment to maintaining and upgrading our facilities, our IT infrastructure, our innovation and enrichment opportunities for students, and security, as you've played a key role in creating a safe and supportive environment for our students and our staff.

380
01:00:20,385 --> 01:00:32,150
As Dr. Cushing moves on to the next chapter of his career as the superintendent of Beverly Public Schools, we wish him success and express our deep appreciation for his contribution to Medford Public Schools.

381
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:39,453
Thank you, Dr. Cushing, for the spirit you brought to the sentiment of, it's a great day to be a Mustang.

382
01:00:40,574 --> 01:00:47,757
We agree and know that you will bring that spirit with you as you inspire Beverly Panther community.

383
01:00:48,969 --> 01:00:58,272
To Mr. Teixeira, we extend our heartfelt thanks to you as our EL director for, I didn't know the exact number, Paul.

384
01:00:58,392 --> 01:00:59,753
I know it's over a decade.

385
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:02,914
Oh, I was wrong.

386
01:01:02,974 --> 01:01:04,295
Just shy of a decade.

387
01:01:07,176 --> 01:01:07,656
There we go.

388
01:01:08,396 --> 01:01:08,836
There we go.

389
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:10,177
Those COVID years count as 0.5.

390
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:30,208
I'm in your dedicated service to measure public schools, Paul's commitment to ensuring equitable instruction and opportunities for all students but specifically our English learners have made a lasting impact on our district, and in their lives.

391
01:01:31,372 --> 01:01:40,667
And so while he also moves on to a superintendency, and it's wonderful news for Provincetown, it's certainly a little bittersweet for Medford.

392
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:44,573
And Paul has pretty big shoes to fill.

393
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:55,187
We will deeply miss your partnership, your guidance, and your strategic thinking, but don't worry, because I will be reaching out and touching base with you.

394
01:01:56,348 --> 01:02:09,058
But in all seriousness, Mr. Texera, your skills and experience, you're ready for this new role, and though we will miss you greatly, we're confident that you're going to make a positive difference, and we're just a phone call away.

395
01:02:10,808 --> 01:02:17,720
And before we kind of give something, I think there may be some school committee members that have a few words to say as well.

396
01:02:20,094 --> 01:02:21,856
Member Reinfeldt.

397
01:02:21,896 --> 01:02:31,004
So we got together and we got you some little things and we just want to say thank you for everything you've done for the district, for the schools of Medford.

398
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:40,672
You've had your fingers in so many different projects over the years and I know I, whenever I would reach out and say, hey, what's going, what about this?

399
01:02:41,433 --> 01:02:45,554
you were already on it, and I know that you were doing it for the students.

400
01:02:46,014 --> 01:02:52,396
Your values and your actions were so beautifully aligned, and we really, really appreciate that.

401
01:02:52,496 --> 01:03:02,179
So we have some cards, we have some tokens of appreciation, and also, do we want to share those or hand them out?

402
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:07,641
Yeah, we want to share.

403
01:03:07,861 --> 01:03:08,081
Yeah.

404
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:08,721
Member Rousseau?

405
01:03:11,836 --> 01:03:13,677
Well, let's do this first, because this is fun.

406
01:03:19,581 --> 01:03:20,161
A little bit.

407
01:03:32,569 --> 01:03:34,010
Thank you very much.

408
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:35,431
Thank you.

409
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:36,311
I will display it proudly.

410
01:03:49,507 --> 01:03:54,370
That is amazing.

411
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:56,691
Member Reinfeld.

412
01:04:13,848 --> 01:04:22,793
We also couldn't let you leave without a reminder of one of the projects, one of the perhaps unexpected projects that has haunted you for your entire time since I've been here.

413
01:04:22,873 --> 01:04:24,233
Thank you very much.

414
01:04:27,855 --> 01:04:30,877
That's Murphy, you know.

415
01:04:31,037 --> 01:04:32,778
Thank you.

416
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,280
Member Rousseau?

417
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:42,663
That's awesome.

418
01:04:43,424 --> 01:04:43,824
Thank you.

419
01:04:43,945 --> 01:04:50,872
I wanted to thank Paul and let him know that I look forward to perhaps having a place to stay in Provincetown.

420
01:04:52,674 --> 01:04:54,876
Although I suspect that's a popular request.

421
01:04:55,917 --> 01:04:57,359
It's so cheap to stay there.

422
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:04,486
And Dr. Cushing, I wanted to thank you for your never ending ask about

423
01:05:06,525 --> 01:05:11,586
self-reflection, but not doing it alone by asking me, you know, how am I doing?

424
01:05:11,726 --> 01:05:14,007
And how does this seem?

425
01:05:14,047 --> 01:05:19,628
And, you know, that level of openness to criticism I thought was refreshing.

426
01:05:20,168 --> 01:05:23,909
And, you know, I could be blunt and honest with you, and you were totally fine with it.

427
01:05:23,949 --> 01:05:25,550
And I appreciate that.

428
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:26,350
And I'm going to miss that.

429
01:05:32,091 --> 01:05:32,731
Thank you very much.

430
01:05:32,792 --> 01:05:33,072
Thank you.

431
01:05:34,012 --> 01:05:34,532
Member Graham?

432
01:05:38,642 --> 01:05:38,962
Thank you.

433
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:44,047
I just wanted to echo what everyone has said already.

434
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:45,188
Thank you both so much.

435
01:05:48,271 --> 01:05:54,657
How Medford has interacted with students has changed so dramatically in the last 10 years.

436
01:05:54,998 --> 01:05:57,360
And it's all for the better.

437
01:05:57,961 --> 01:05:58,741
And you're part of that.

438
01:05:58,801 --> 01:05:59,242
So thank you.

439
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:10,416
I also want to just say thank you so, so much for your years of service here in Medford.

440
01:06:11,316 --> 01:06:24,507
Peter you were so many hats, so many times and you juggled so much and got the job done and Paul, same you over the years, especially through COVID just that calm presence and just

441
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:26,966
great to have you as part of the team.

442
01:06:27,046 --> 01:06:32,711
We are gonna, we are losing two very, very strong admin in the Medford Public Schools.

443
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:38,015
I know Dr. Gullose will do her best with trying to fill your shoes, but it's gonna be very difficult.

444
01:06:38,055 --> 01:06:39,196
So thank you for all you've done.

445
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,042
Member Ntapa.

446
01:06:49,045 --> 01:06:49,585
Thank you, Mayor.

447
01:06:50,185 --> 01:06:52,326
I just echo all the comments of my colleagues.

448
01:06:52,366 --> 01:06:58,008
Thank you both for doing all the work you've done to make the Medford Public Schools a better place for our students.

449
01:06:58,328 --> 01:07:05,070
The framework you guys have set up will continue to do so even while you are both in your respective roles.

450
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:09,151
You know, it was funny, I think reflecting on the past

451
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:20,694
not exactly two years of being here, you know, some of the two first thoughts I had was what exactly is Peter's job description because of the amount of hats that he wears and the amount of things he does, is he Marcont?

452
01:07:20,734 --> 01:07:21,394
What is he doing?

453
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:28,396
And then the second, when I state, you know, oh, I work for the Metropolitan School Committee, it's like, isn't Paul Teixeira just great?

454
01:07:29,136 --> 01:07:30,157
Isn't he just phenomenal?

455
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:35,959
And so you both really are very key figures in our school system.

456
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:38,700
And I just want to thank you both for doing, you know, the work that you've done.

457
01:07:40,913 --> 01:07:45,757
Like the mayor said, it is bittersweet, but excited to see what you guys do next.

458
01:07:46,037 --> 01:07:46,518
So thank you.

459
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:55,204
Thank you.

460
01:07:58,987 --> 01:08:00,449
Yeah, Peter needs to wear the belt.

461
01:09:49,457 --> 01:09:56,602
Next up, we have the update to policy IKF, increased flexibility for students, health and physical education requirements.

462
01:09:57,142 --> 01:09:58,823
Again, I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Glucy.

463
01:09:58,843 --> 01:10:03,486
Thank you.

464
01:10:03,526 --> 01:10:04,127
Good evening.

465
01:10:07,845 --> 01:10:11,567
So I know in your, we've had conversations back and forth.

466
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:19,691
I know in your packets, you have the updated language for the graduation requirements for physical education and health.

467
01:10:20,451 --> 01:10:31,736
I will review those and just let me know if you want it displayed, but in having conversations and director Rachel Perry is still here.

468
01:10:31,796 --> 01:10:34,518
So I would invite her to the podium in case there are any questions.

469
01:10:35,972 --> 01:10:45,977
What you have in front of you is the Medford Public Schools response to increasing flexibility for our students, which would move health one.

470
01:10:47,457 --> 01:10:57,622
Students would either take health one in ninth grade or in 10th grade, depending on their schedule and the demands of each individual student's schedule.

471
01:10:58,383 --> 01:11:03,025
And health two would either be completed in grade 10 or grade 11.

472
01:11:05,497 --> 01:11:17,147
Physical education, the requirement is eight semesters of physical education with four enrolled in Medford Public Schools, Medford High School courses.

473
01:11:17,928 --> 01:11:20,150
And then the second four students would have a choice.

474
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:29,298
They can continue taking courses offered by Medford High School, or they can participate in the independent study that Director Perry has created.

475
01:11:30,573 --> 01:11:40,085
The independent study is a footnote at the bottom of the graduation requirement, as well as linked to a separate document for review.

476
01:11:42,148 --> 01:11:48,215
The independent study, I don't know, would you like, I can explain it, I don't know if you want to explain the independent study.

477
01:11:48,235 --> 01:11:49,277
Sure.

478
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:59,020
Sure, the independent study was created so that students would have some flexibility and be able to take some more courses within their day.

479
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:04,721
There's a lot of our students that do take things outside of school, dance, jujitsu, things like that.

480
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:15,083
So I thought that was a great opportunity for us to count that as some credit, but in allow students to have some room in their schedule to take other electives that they could take.

481
01:12:15,843 --> 01:12:17,164
So that was a great opportunity.

482
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:32,016
And it also still allows us to offer some electives that students might want to continue taking some of the things we're thinking about is like a advanced nutrition course and athletic training course.

483
01:12:32,496 --> 01:12:36,519
One of the things that I've been thinking about as well as maybe teaming up with our math

484
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:42,450
department in doing an athletic statistics course where we can have students come out and work with our sports teams.

485
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:45,756
So there's a lot of great things that we can do for electives as well.

486
01:12:46,882 --> 01:12:47,422
Thank you.

487
01:12:47,683 --> 01:12:57,591
And so for the independent study students, after they've completed the four semesters of physical education courses through Medford High School, there are pathways that they can choose.

488
01:12:57,631 --> 01:13:13,304
So if they are current athletes, that is one way that students that are enrolled in playing a Massachusetts interscholastic athletic association sanctioned sport would qualify them for the independent study per approval

489
01:13:13,884 --> 01:13:24,347
and consultation with director Perry, as well as the opportunity for students that are in an instructionally based activity.

490
01:13:24,687 --> 01:13:40,752
So dance, martial arts, things of that nature that would require also approval by Dr. Perry, the passing of the four previous courses and just a log from the instructor of those

491
01:13:41,769 --> 01:13:44,790
fitness slash exercise programs?

492
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:51,593
Sure, this is something that we have done in the past as well for those students that were taking six majors.

493
01:13:51,613 --> 01:13:59,136
So some of our students that wanted to double in math in their sophomore year, we did offer an independent study for those students as well.

494
01:13:59,176 --> 01:14:00,596
So it's something we have done in the past.

495
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:03,898
We're just really now opening it up to more students.

496
01:14:08,439 --> 01:14:08,900
Any questions?

497
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:14,331
Thank you for putting this together.

498
01:14:14,391 --> 01:14:16,833
I really appreciate the increased flexibility.

499
01:14:17,013 --> 01:14:21,096
When we saw this last time, there was also talk of independent studies for health.

500
01:14:21,176 --> 01:14:23,718
And I'm wondering what happened with those.

501
01:14:25,179 --> 01:14:30,522
So I think what we can do for that piece would be to offer more health electives for students to take.

502
01:14:30,542 --> 01:14:37,207
Would that count as part of the physical education independent study, or would those be their own independent electives?

503
01:14:37,267 --> 01:14:38,808
That would be their own independent electives.

504
01:14:43,194 --> 01:14:46,535
Member Graham?

505
01:14:46,595 --> 01:14:47,295
Thank you for this.

506
01:14:48,075 --> 01:15:02,340
I think this creates a lot of options which as you know like that's part of what we've been trying to do with this all of this schedule change is to is to open up the kind of options that students really have time to explore and

507
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:11,204
get the academic support that they need along the way and the prior schedule just didn't allow for that across many different kinds of students.

508
01:15:12,785 --> 01:15:18,747
I am really happy that we are sort of holding to our commitment to health education.

509
01:15:18,767 --> 01:15:27,972
I certainly think we have room to do the same in middle school and sort of look at the rigor around our middle school curriculum.

510
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:37,458
in many regards, but I think providing this kind of flexibility at the high school level is really important because that's really where there is so much opportunity.

511
01:15:37,638 --> 01:15:50,167
And I think providing programming like athletic statistics and athletic training, like there's plenty of students who would really embrace that and it would back up the math teaching that is going on in the building as well.

512
01:15:50,267 --> 01:15:53,469
So I think opening up the electives in general,

513
01:15:55,878 --> 01:15:57,660
is just it's new and it's different.

514
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,883
But I think there's so many possibilities.

515
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:09,693
And I think especially when you can capture the attention of students in a thing that they're already passionate about, like you have so much more opportunity.

516
01:16:09,713 --> 01:16:14,979
So I'm really glad to hear about all of the elective offerings that this is allowing us to get to.

517
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:27,603
because there is there are only so many hours in the day and they're really there are only so many teachers in the building and so creating some ways for us to be a little bit more creative is super important and exciting.

518
01:16:27,743 --> 01:16:29,784
So thank you for doing all this work.

519
01:16:29,884 --> 01:16:38,467
I know it's like at the very last minute, but I think students starting next year will be really appreciative of the change.

520
01:16:38,547 --> 01:16:39,187
So thank you.

521
01:16:39,547 --> 01:16:39,867
Thank you.

522
01:16:44,973 --> 01:16:45,554
member Russell.

523
01:16:47,476 --> 01:16:47,856
Thank you.

524
01:16:47,876 --> 01:16:56,304
Um, I especially like the, um part about students who do not pass the MCAS and a slightly off topic.

525
01:16:56,824 --> 01:17:04,691
It's part of the policy, but, um, going back and getting those kids their diplomas is a big deal.

526
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:07,073
And I just was, um, I see that

527
01:17:08,922 --> 01:17:14,410
They wouldn't be students, they'd all be adults at this point, but that they can request this on our website.

528
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:21,520
I don't know where on the website that would be found, so maybe we could make that a little more obvious.

529
01:17:24,163 --> 01:17:28,267
if we have students that are interested, I feel like we should do something for them.

530
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:35,974
They're not students, they're all grown-ups, but if they want something and we can do something for them to make it feel special, I would be totally up for that.

531
01:17:35,994 --> 01:17:48,466
2003 is a long time ago to graduate, but I suspect that a lot of folks who would have received a diploma but did not and are now being told they can have one, like

532
01:17:50,089 --> 01:17:55,651
probably a very bittersweet thing, but I think that if they're open to, if they want to do something, we should do something for them.

533
01:17:55,751 --> 01:17:59,672
So that's not emotion, but just a thought.

534
01:18:00,313 --> 01:18:07,315
I just, it really has always bothered me that they could pass all of the stuff we say, but still not get a diploma.

535
01:18:07,575 --> 01:18:14,758
And can't really write that wrong from the perspective of how that affected their lives, but we can at least

536
01:18:17,028 --> 01:18:21,169
give them a diploma and make it a big deal like it was for everybody else that went to graduation.

537
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:22,530
So thank you.

538
01:18:24,751 --> 01:18:25,291
Dr. Lucy?

539
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:26,092
Yes, thank you.

540
01:18:26,112 --> 01:18:38,858
So I do know that our high school administrative staff and guidance department, school counseling department has been in touch with some previous students who are looking for their diploma.

541
01:18:38,918 --> 01:18:39,438
I can have

542
01:18:40,318 --> 01:18:50,285
a conversation about acknowledgement to your point, but I do know that we have received some requests and that those are being fulfilled as they come in.

543
01:18:50,405 --> 01:18:53,967
So an acknowledgement is something that I can have a conversation about.

544
01:18:53,987 --> 01:18:55,007
That's a very nice idea.

545
01:18:55,728 --> 01:18:56,088
Thank you.

546
01:18:56,849 --> 01:18:57,089
Thank you.

547
01:18:57,129 --> 01:18:58,069
Is there a motion on the floor?

548
01:18:58,570 --> 01:18:59,070
Member Brantley?

549
01:19:00,471 --> 01:19:00,671
Sure.

550
01:19:01,391 --> 01:19:05,374
Do we know how many people, how many students it is or adults at this point, I should say?

551
01:19:06,573 --> 01:19:09,415
I wouldn't want to misspeak.

552
01:19:09,595 --> 01:19:14,839
I know of two for sure, but I can get a firm number and let you all know.

553
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,162
Do we have to put a motion on the floor to have some sort of little soiree, or are we good?

554
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:21,564
We can just have that in our own little fun time.

555
01:19:22,084 --> 01:19:22,265
Yes.

556
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:23,566
Okay, I like that.

557
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,167
Yeah, if they want one.

558
01:19:25,407 --> 01:19:26,408
Okay, thank you.

559
01:19:26,568 --> 01:19:28,349
Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

560
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:32,632
By Member Ntukpa, seconded by Member Olopade.

561
01:19:33,113 --> 01:19:34,033
All those in favor?

562
01:19:35,474 --> 01:19:36,155
All those opposed?

563
01:19:37,425 --> 01:19:38,106
Member Russo?

564
01:19:41,408 --> 01:19:42,549
What's the second reading, right?

565
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,252
I think we asked for adjustments, so this might be the first.

566
01:19:46,873 --> 01:19:48,554
We asked for, yeah, adjustments.

567
01:19:48,574 --> 01:19:49,855
This is the first reading.

568
01:19:50,135 --> 01:19:50,736
Oh, the first reading.

569
01:19:50,876 --> 01:19:51,476
Okay, thank you.

570
01:19:51,516 --> 01:19:52,817
And who firsted and seconded?

571
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:55,940
It was Member Ntapa and then seconded by Member Olopade.

572
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:56,420
Thank you.

573
01:19:57,281 --> 01:19:58,582
And all those are in favor?

574
01:19:58,882 --> 01:19:59,963
Any opposed?

575
01:20:00,683 --> 01:20:01,584
Motion passes.

576
01:20:01,844 --> 01:20:03,225
First reading has been approved.

577
01:20:07,826 --> 01:20:09,928
Motion by Member Graham to waive the second reading.

578
01:20:10,808 --> 01:20:12,570
Member Reinfeld seconds.

579
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:13,791
All those in favor?

580
01:20:14,391 --> 01:20:14,472
Aye.

581
01:20:14,712 --> 01:20:15,452
All those opposed?

582
01:20:18,315 --> 01:20:19,095
Readings are waived.

583
01:20:20,116 --> 01:20:20,597
Thank you.

584
01:20:20,697 --> 01:20:24,840
The high school counseling staff appreciates the expedition of that.

585
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:25,441
Yes.

586
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:26,181
Thank you.

587
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:26,481
Thank you.

588
01:20:26,622 --> 01:20:27,122
Great.

589
01:20:35,012 --> 01:20:35,392
Thank you.

590
01:20:35,632 --> 01:20:38,873
Moving on to our number eight, our budget amendment and vote.

591
01:20:38,893 --> 01:20:42,074
I'm going to invite up Mr. Jerry McHugh, our budget analyst.

592
01:20:46,115 --> 01:20:48,796
And Noel Ales.

593
01:21:00,519 --> 01:21:00,799
Welcome.

594
01:21:07,318 --> 01:21:21,949
Thank you school committee members and in your packet you have a reconciliation plan that was discussed at the time the budget was passed.

595
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:30,256
It was certainly discussed at the City Council meeting as well.

596
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:41,012
the school committee approved the budget last March based on the needs of the district.

597
01:21:44,073 --> 01:22:01,380
The city was able to fund most of that and asked us to come up with a way to see if we can make some adjustments in order to align with the

598
01:22:04,184 --> 01:22:08,887
that the mayor was able to submit to the City Council a few weeks ago.

599
01:22:10,868 --> 01:22:12,790
So it relies on a few things.

600
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:18,253
You know, we have some funds from the question eight override.

601
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:29,141
We have some revolving funds that are performing very well that we can transfer some positions to.

602
01:22:31,422 --> 01:22:41,024
we were able to get a commitment from the city for a free cash appropriation to help with some of our capital needs.

603
01:22:43,445 --> 01:22:52,227
And then we made several small moves so that we're still spending up to the level that the school committee approved.

604
01:22:53,487 --> 01:23:04,094
back in May, but we've kind of made adjustments to the sources of revenue that can help fund those positions and expenses.

605
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:09,938
And then, you know, the budget has to be monitored all the time.

606
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:12,060
And when

607
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,101
It's time to develop next year's budget.

608
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:17,543
We'll take a look at all these moves.

609
01:23:17,683 --> 01:23:18,924
Can they be sustained?

610
01:23:20,304 --> 01:23:22,486
And we will continue to sustain them.

611
01:23:22,606 --> 01:23:32,211
If they can't, we'll make some budget proposals to make sure we have sufficient funds to run Medford Public Schools.

612
01:23:34,893 --> 01:23:35,193
Thank you.

613
01:23:35,858 --> 01:23:36,378
Thank you both.

614
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:41,139
And I know the free cash papers are on the city council agenda for tomorrow.

615
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:47,341
I think we just need to get one more paper before the council there last meeting, which is in two weeks.

616
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:54,283
But otherwise, everything is under control for my office on the many papers we're trying to get to the council before the end of the fiscal year.

617
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,464
If there's no questions, is there a motion for approval?

618
01:24:00,185 --> 01:24:00,645
Member Graham?

619
01:24:00,665 --> 01:24:01,265
No.

620
01:24:01,805 --> 01:24:02,765
Member Russo, I think, was first.

621
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:04,626
Member Russo, then Member Graham.

622
01:24:06,517 --> 01:24:06,917
Thank you.

623
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:23,696
I know we've talked about a stable, the stabilization fund several times I just want to, I don't know what the accounting requirements are to make sure that really happens but I just want to make sure that all the teaser being crossed and eyes are being dotted so that we don't.

624
01:24:24,218 --> 01:24:24,418
I'm sorry.

625
01:24:24,438 --> 01:24:26,079
I didn't find out that there was like a July one.

626
01:24:26,199 --> 01:24:26,620
Oh sorry.

627
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:31,423
We didn't do it by July one, so it can't happen till next time we have certified cash or something.

628
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,204
So I just want to make sure that's happening.

629
01:24:33,845 --> 01:24:39,448
Well, we've been invited to City Council meeting tomorrow night, so I believe that, um.

630
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:40,589
Part of the

631
01:24:52,693 --> 01:24:59,557
The year closes and the year won't close possibly till August or September.

632
01:24:59,617 --> 01:25:08,202
But the idea would be that we will have money in FY25 that we want to make available in FY26.

633
01:25:08,262 --> 01:25:17,367
So there'll be a transfer from our FY25 budget into the stabilization fund in order to make that happen.

634
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:18,388
Thank you very much.

635
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:20,249
Member Graham?

636
01:25:24,142 --> 01:25:24,502
Thank you.

637
01:25:25,923 --> 01:25:28,025
Thank you for this reconciliation.

638
01:25:28,045 --> 01:25:38,152
I think I just want to highlight some of the top line of this, which one is that the city increased its allocation to Medford Public Schools to 3%.

639
01:25:39,213 --> 01:25:47,979
So thank you to the mayor for the hard work that I and the sweat that I think it took to get there.

640
01:25:47,999 --> 01:25:49,020
You're very pushy.

641
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,881
You are very pushy.

642
01:25:53,547 --> 01:25:53,947
We did it.

643
01:25:54,027 --> 01:25:54,448
We did it.

644
01:25:54,528 --> 01:25:54,888
We're good.

645
01:25:55,548 --> 01:25:57,289
Yeah, thank you very much for that.

646
01:25:57,849 --> 01:25:59,090
I think it's super important.

647
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:13,317
But you know, one of the things that if you look in the in the weeds of this, one of the things I'm most excited about is Miss Cabral from the high school has been talking about the need to create an alternative program at Medford High for two years now.

648
01:26:14,038 --> 01:26:14,178
And

649
01:26:14,907 --> 01:26:18,491
Among all of the things that have happened since we approved the budget.

650
01:26:19,893 --> 01:26:32,408
We also collectively found funding for her to get that started and that will be really really critical particularly for some of our freshmen is is my understanding as they come up to the high school from the middle school.

651
01:26:33,268 --> 01:26:38,150
to have increased academic support so that they can graduate on time.

652
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:43,772
And I think that's a huge, it's a huge deal to be able to have this space to create this program.

653
01:26:44,512 --> 01:26:52,794
And I know that that wasn't, you know, that wasn't in the budget when we started so adding that sort of made things slightly worse in terms of reconciliation.

654
01:26:54,535 --> 01:26:58,157
but we were able to to get there through any number of things.

655
01:26:58,217 --> 01:27:07,663
We'll talk in just a few minutes about the MEEP line items as well because that came up and well that's I think next on our agenda.

656
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:14,327
But I'm just really happy that we were able to have a budget year without fanfare and I

657
01:27:15,087 --> 01:27:21,869
do want to thank everybody who supported questions seven and eight because that is why we were able to have a budget without fanfare.

658
01:27:22,989 --> 01:27:35,853
For those people who may be listening at home, I think the other important thing about the stabilization funds that we're talking about is those stabilization funds are being put into place because there are things that we will pay for in FY26 that

659
01:27:37,893 --> 01:27:42,839
got going in some way, shape or form in FY 25, which is the reason we have to hold the money over.

660
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:55,854
We also are continuing to negotiate with our bargaining partners, including the nurses and the paras and our maintenance team and our cafeteria staff.

661
01:27:56,054 --> 01:27:56,775
And who am I missing?

662
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:00,694
next year.

663
01:28:01,755 --> 01:28:06,896
So there's still like four or five, four unions or so that we are working diligently with.

664
01:28:06,936 --> 01:28:09,297
We had meetings earlier today with one of them.

665
01:28:09,997 --> 01:28:17,460
And so all of that unknown means in all likelihood, those funds are going to need to be expended in FY26 instead of FY25.

666
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,461
So the stabilization fund that will

667
01:28:20,341 --> 01:28:27,766
go before the council to be created will just allow us the flexibility to do that without creating another crisis next year.

668
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:36,271
So I think all of this is sort of thank you to the sound fiscal management that's happening at Medford Public Schools.

669
01:28:36,371 --> 01:28:38,412
I know it's a constant

670
01:28:39,373 --> 01:28:56,403
constantly moving pile of quicksand when you look at the budget and the number of people and who, who is where and who's retiring and who's needs to come in and who you know how all of this fits together so I just think like you both have done a really really nice job.

671
01:28:57,203 --> 01:29:03,145
And when we can boil down a meeting in June to one page, that's clear as day what's happening.

672
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:07,526
Like we have made so many considerable strides in our finance office.

673
01:29:07,586 --> 01:29:09,267
Like I'm really, really impressed.

674
01:29:09,407 --> 01:29:10,427
So thank you very much.

675
01:29:11,788 --> 01:29:14,789
And I would make a motion to approve the budget as amended.

676
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:18,530
Member Rheingold.

677
01:29:20,519 --> 01:29:30,181
I just wanted to echo the thanks that has already been said and to note that I'm pleased that these adjustments do not include cuts to the arts and to mental health support.

678
01:29:30,321 --> 01:29:34,122
I see some of those things have increased for the position needs here.

679
01:29:34,182 --> 01:29:40,463
And so I want to call that out and say thank you, because those I think are really essential for the health of our community.

680
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:42,543
And I will second the motion.

681
01:29:45,024 --> 01:29:47,865
Motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by member Reinfeld.

682
01:29:47,885 --> 01:29:50,245
Do you want to roll call?

683
01:29:50,998 --> 01:29:51,598
We'll call vote.

684
01:29:55,521 --> 01:29:56,102
That means me.

685
01:29:57,903 --> 01:29:58,583
Member Brantley.

686
01:30:00,965 --> 01:30:01,546
Actually, yes.

687
01:30:02,586 --> 01:30:05,869
Yeah, it's your conflict, so you have to decide.

688
01:30:06,589 --> 01:30:08,731
And do you wanna announce what your conflict is?

689
01:30:10,432 --> 01:30:11,353
That's what I do usually.

690
01:30:11,373 --> 01:30:14,695
Okay, yeah, so my sister is literacy coach here in the district.

691
01:30:14,735 --> 01:30:17,197
My mother is a lunch monitor, so that covers me.

692
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:22,938
And same before the roll is called, my sister works in the Metro Public Schools, so I'll also be abstaining.

693
01:30:24,818 --> 01:30:25,499
Roll call, please.

694
01:30:26,459 --> 01:30:26,999
Member Graham.

695
01:30:27,239 --> 01:30:27,479
Yes.

696
01:30:29,139 --> 01:30:29,780
Member Atapa.

697
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,260
Yes.

698
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:32,120
Member Olopade.

699
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:32,760
Yes.

700
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,941
Member Rheinfeldt.

701
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:35,281
Yes.

702
01:30:35,781 --> 01:30:36,781
Member Rousseau, yes.

703
01:30:36,861 --> 01:30:38,421
And Mayor Landau-Kern is abstaining.

704
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:39,262
Abstaining, yes.

705
01:30:39,342 --> 01:30:41,242
Five in favor, two abstaining.

706
01:30:41,642 --> 01:30:42,302
Paper passes.

707
01:30:42,802 --> 01:30:43,403
Thank you very much.

708
01:30:43,983 --> 01:30:44,383
Thank you.

709
01:30:45,003 --> 01:30:45,303
Thank you.

710
01:30:46,990 --> 01:31:01,436
We do not have any presentations of the public, but we do have continued business 2025-12 offered by member Reinfeld, whereas uneven distribution of students across the city's elementary schools has constrained Medford Public Schools ability to most effectively.

711
01:31:02,476 --> 01:31:03,957
We've read it a couple times now.

712
01:31:03,997 --> 01:31:08,439
Yes, this is space needs in the Medford Public Schools elementary.

713
01:31:08,619 --> 01:31:10,840
And it's also our report from the subcommittee.

714
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:14,615
Okay.

715
01:31:16,395 --> 01:31:17,836
Someone second my wave reading.

716
01:31:17,856 --> 01:31:18,136
Second.

717
01:31:19,336 --> 01:31:22,557
Motion to waive the reading by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Graham.

718
01:31:22,597 --> 01:31:23,357
All those in favor?

719
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:23,897
Aye.

720
01:31:24,337 --> 01:31:25,297
All those opposed?

721
01:31:25,477 --> 01:31:26,897
Reading has been waived.

722
01:31:27,417 --> 01:31:28,338
I'm going to turn it over to who?

723
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:28,418
Me.

724
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:31,378
Member Graham.

725
01:31:31,698 --> 01:31:32,158
Thank you.

726
01:31:32,798 --> 01:31:41,260
We did have a subcommittee meeting a few light years ago now, but actually on May 20th,

727
01:31:43,386 --> 01:31:49,291
And during that meeting, Dr. Pelosi shared a presentation with us that provided all of this information.

728
01:31:49,331 --> 01:31:53,174
It was linked in your packets for anybody who wants to take a deeper dive.

729
01:31:55,095 --> 01:32:02,581
And we talked a little bit about the data and what the data was telling us across all of our elementary schools in particular.

730
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:09,927
And we talked to, had a really interesting conversation about potential solutions, all of which,

731
01:32:11,309 --> 01:32:19,383
are longer term than the immediate need that we have to make sure that we have space to welcome students in August.

732
01:32:20,064 --> 01:32:22,088
Dr. Galluzzi also let us know that

733
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:36,954
there will be a detailed space study happening in the district this summer to really sort of map out and lay out like our plan as we go forward when we look at our enrollment trends.

734
01:32:37,034 --> 01:32:45,981
So now that we are looking at our enrollment trends in a formal way every year, it makes sense to say what, you know, how far into the future does this

735
01:32:46,882 --> 01:32:50,903
particular plan hold and what are the possible solutions.

736
01:32:51,003 --> 01:32:54,044
So that will be happening this year, this summer.

737
01:32:55,504 --> 01:33:14,890
But we did make a couple of motions in subcommittee that I think that we should read out here and vote on as a larger committee because the Roberts right now is full and the question becomes like what do we do in order to

738
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:23,434
alleviate that issue for August because the space study is not going to have those kinds of magical answers.

739
01:33:24,935 --> 01:33:36,142
So, we had some public participation from members of the Roberts community as well as some of our other elementary communities and there were a couple of motions that came out of the minutes.

740
01:33:36,262 --> 01:33:40,985
So, one was a motion to move to meet classrooms from the Roberts to the

741
01:33:44,987 --> 01:33:49,588
and that was unanimously agreed to be voted out to this group.

742
01:33:51,448 --> 01:34:11,412
Creating that space, so the Missittuck has space for those two classrooms, but creating two classrooms worth of space at the Roberts is pretty pivotal to what comes next, which was to request two additional FTEs at the Roberts to account for some of the bigger bubble classrooms that we have and there's

743
01:34:11,872 --> 01:34:15,314
like more bubbles there on a continuous basis.

744
01:34:15,334 --> 01:34:17,375
So they're probably not bubbles anymore.

745
01:34:17,396 --> 01:34:19,517
They probably just started like sort of the way things are.

746
01:34:20,758 --> 01:34:26,541
But those FTE counts were also in the budget that we just approved.

747
01:34:26,621 --> 01:34:28,923
So that these have been accounted for as well.

748
01:34:30,406 --> 01:34:31,946
That also passed unanimously.

749
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:45,869
And then there was a third motion as amended to create a strategic space planning task force of staff and caregivers once the space utilization study is completed by the HMFH architects.

750
01:34:46,929 --> 01:34:48,690
And that also passed unanimously.

751
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:54,551
So I think the space study is going to be really important so that we know what options we have.

752
01:34:55,832 --> 01:35:00,835
but then the real work will begin in terms of what does that mean in terms of change.

753
01:35:00,955 --> 01:35:13,343
So having a task force of sorts of staff and caregivers to be part of that process as it unfolds in the late summer and early fall was another recommendation.

754
01:35:13,483 --> 01:35:21,308
So I think we should take a vote on those three and we can do it all together or we can do them one at a time.

755
01:35:21,328 --> 01:35:23,710
We should do them separate, okay.

756
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:33,460
And just to jump in, you mentioned the bubble, but to be really explicit about what that is, all but one grade at the Roberts next year will have five classrooms at that level.

757
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:40,101
Everyone except the fifth graders, and that is where those new classrooms are needed.

758
01:35:40,222 --> 01:35:43,502
And it also affects the ability to engage with specialists.

759
01:35:43,602 --> 01:35:52,165
So you saw in the amended budget that one of those positions is a specialist teacher, so that everyone gets that access to those enrichment.

760
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:54,306
academic experiences.

761
01:35:55,527 --> 01:35:57,229
So do you want me to read the motions?

762
01:35:58,149 --> 01:35:58,650
That would be great.

763
01:35:59,230 --> 01:35:59,530
Somebody.

764
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:01,212
Okay, sure.

765
01:36:01,272 --> 01:36:05,695
Okay.

766
01:36:05,775 --> 01:36:07,076
The motion is to move.

767
01:36:08,798 --> 01:36:11,980
Meet that the two or the two other only to 22.

768
01:36:12,501 --> 01:36:18,025
Okay to move to meet classrooms from the Roberts to the mistook beginning in August of 2025.

769
01:36:19,266 --> 01:36:20,327
I'll make that motion.

770
01:36:22,107 --> 01:36:22,967
I'll second it.

771
01:36:23,927 --> 01:36:29,649
Member Graham.

772
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:32,969
Member Ntapa.

773
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:39,331
Thank you, Mayor.

774
01:36:40,231 --> 01:36:41,191
So quick question.

775
01:36:41,491 --> 01:36:44,872
Thank you all for doing the work and trying to figure out this

776
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:51,005
very large issue of space capacity that we have within the district.

777
01:36:51,386 --> 01:36:56,551
So I was not able to attend the meeting and I didn't get a chance to watch it yet.

778
01:36:56,611 --> 01:36:58,232
So I just wanted to ask a quick question.

779
01:36:58,592 --> 01:37:01,956
Was there a specific reason as to why the Missituck was chosen?

780
01:37:01,996 --> 01:37:03,637
Was it just because of the space?

781
01:37:03,797 --> 01:37:11,745
The Missituck was the only school that didn't have space constraints and had classrooms available with bathrooms for the preschool level.

782
01:37:12,205 --> 01:37:31,271
I just wasn't sure, because I know we have a good amount of, I believe, services going on at the Mississippi, so I just wanted to make sure that that wouldn't cause an issue of introducing another, like, again, just wanted to cover all bases because I just don't want it to, I just want to make sure that that was accounted for, and also the fact that those folks were consulted on that decision.

783
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:33,611
Dr. Galluzzi as well.

784
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:35,012
Thank you, I can clarify that.

785
01:37:37,735 --> 01:37:51,446
First, if we're just looking at enrollment, as Member Reinfeldt stated, the Mississippi is the only school right now without constraints regarding enrollment as well as programming.

786
01:37:53,397 --> 01:37:54,999
We had moved previously.

787
01:37:55,019 --> 01:38:07,349
The McGlynn School, I think it's important to note, the McGlynn School may not have the enrollment capacity issues that the Brooks or the Roberts has, but the McGlynn does have some space constraints.

788
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:09,731
It is the only elementary school with three floors.

789
01:38:10,592 --> 01:38:12,573
And the other elementary schools have four floors.

790
01:38:13,234 --> 01:38:21,478
So by removing a whole entire floor of options, they may not have the enrollment capacity, but they definitely have a space one.

791
01:38:22,039 --> 01:38:24,140
So two things have happened.

792
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:29,843
One, at the McGlynn, there is a need for an additional access classroom next year.

793
01:38:30,344 --> 01:38:32,245
So we had to increase in that area.

794
01:38:33,795 --> 01:38:44,043
When Mr. Teixeira created the additional strand of newcomer that also was at the McGlynn, that's five classrooms right there.

795
01:38:47,085 --> 01:38:55,311
At that time, or around that time, the MEEP program that was at the McGlynn was relocated to the Mesituc.

796
01:38:56,012 --> 01:38:59,314
So the McGlynn for the past, Ms.

797
01:38:59,334 --> 01:39:01,936
Bowen, two, three years has not had a MEEP program.

798
01:39:03,168 --> 01:39:15,213
So it also creates a nice opportunity for a little bit more collaboration, because right now there'll just be two schools with MEEP programming.

799
01:39:16,054 --> 01:39:27,499
The other thing that we did see is our work with Mr. McHugh and Mr. Velez and Mr. Texera is that next year for our newcomer program in grade five, we don't need to

800
01:39:28,532 --> 01:39:30,233
fifth grade newcomer classrooms.

801
01:39:30,933 --> 01:39:39,858
So it will just be at the McGlynn and that fifth grade at the Missituck also creates yet another classroom space that is available.

802
01:39:40,879 --> 01:39:57,988
So right now you will, for next year, 25, 26, you will have two or three MEEP classrooms at the Brooks, two MEEP classrooms at the Brooks, and then the remaining at the Missituck, I believe it's now four, five,

803
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:11,582
Awesome, yeah, no, I think what I'm pulling from is, I believe it was, while we're talking about budget cycles, last budget cycle, the Missittuck came up quite a bit just because while there is lower enrollment in certain areas, there are higher needs.

804
01:40:11,842 --> 01:40:24,345
And so that's why I sort of was curious if folks from the Missittuck were consulted with, how much disruption, not disruption, but how much bringing it in would cause, but if that has been considered then.

805
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:27,061
Sure, I think it's important to note, so Ms.

806
01:40:27,101 --> 01:40:37,310
Bowen did go over and have meetings with staff, there was outreach to caregivers, and I think that's very valid.

807
01:40:37,570 --> 01:40:44,176
Every elementary school has specialized programming under special education.

808
01:40:45,757 --> 01:40:55,200
I would say those vary in regard to need, those vary in regard to support and resource, as well as enrollment.

809
01:40:56,340 --> 01:41:01,922
So there is a need for sure at the Missituck, just as there is at the Roberts.

810
01:41:02,902 --> 01:41:13,625
I think part of that data that I presented at the subcommittee meeting showed that, so the Roberts specialized programming, the Connections program is quite large.

811
01:41:14,445 --> 01:41:16,766
and actually growing each year.

812
01:41:16,786 --> 01:41:19,947
And I believe they're up to five classrooms, five classrooms.

813
01:41:20,587 --> 01:41:29,449
And the therapeutic learning program at the Missittuck definitely has student need as they all do, but there are three classrooms.

814
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:34,771
And so it's also just a matter of space and availability.

815
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:35,871
Awesome.

816
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:36,391
Thank you.

817
01:41:36,411 --> 01:41:38,152
I'm sure this all was answered in the meeting.

818
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:40,672
It's just not something I had a chance to look at yet.

819
01:41:40,692 --> 01:41:41,913
So I just wanted to ask it on the floor.

820
01:41:42,053 --> 01:41:42,533
So thank you.

821
01:41:42,553 --> 01:41:43,193
That's understandable.

822
01:41:45,308 --> 01:41:45,589
Thank you.

823
01:41:45,809 --> 01:41:47,354
Member Graham and Member Reinfeldt.

824
01:41:47,374 --> 01:41:50,542
I was just ready to vote.

825
01:41:50,863 --> 01:41:51,184
Oh, okay.

826
01:41:56,427 --> 01:42:12,572
I was just also going to say one of the things, not to rehash the entire meeting because I think it is worth looking at the presentation and the recap, but is that one of the things we're thinking about with the new that came up was the new high school is looking to have early childhood because there are programs like that in the building.

827
01:42:12,592 --> 01:42:16,653
We have a unique opportunity with MSBA to grow MEAP-like programs.

828
01:42:17,753 --> 01:42:18,694
for the whole district.

829
01:42:18,834 --> 01:42:35,601
And so this meeting was a really interesting balance of the short-term fixing the challenges that are directly affecting next year's ability to really stay above water and looking at the long-term solutions.

830
01:42:35,681 --> 01:42:44,365
And so early childhood, we had an interesting discussion around that in the context of both the new high school and what all the schools have to offer, as Dr. Galussi said.

831
01:42:51,157 --> 01:42:51,958
All those in favor?

832
01:42:53,178 --> 01:42:53,899
All those opposed?

833
01:42:54,339 --> 01:42:55,039
Motion passes.

834
01:42:58,001 --> 01:42:58,462
Member Russo?

835
01:42:58,722 --> 01:42:59,042
Thank you.

836
01:42:59,342 --> 01:43:00,843
The next one is the motion.

837
01:43:01,003 --> 01:43:03,325
Do we need to motion to request?

838
01:43:03,725 --> 01:43:04,345
We already did that.

839
01:43:04,365 --> 01:43:06,206
We've already approved that, sorry.

840
01:43:06,286 --> 01:43:12,630
The motion is, excuse me, as amended.

841
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:16,052
So I don't have the language of the unamended, but I'll find that.

842
01:43:18,615 --> 01:43:28,127
is to create a strategic space planning task force of staff and caregivers once our space utilization study is completed by HMFH Architects.

843
01:43:29,268 --> 01:43:30,390
Oliver, motion that?

844
01:43:32,933 --> 01:43:33,173
I did.

845
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:38,920
that we do a space needs study with the architects?

846
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:39,581
Is that what you said?

847
01:43:39,601 --> 01:43:43,302
So the space study is commissioned for the summer to happen.

848
01:43:43,402 --> 01:43:50,324
And then once that data is in, it falls to the district to analyze and say, all right, what are we going to do with this?

849
01:43:50,344 --> 01:43:53,564
Does this mean we're restructuring the grade levels at different schools?

850
01:43:53,584 --> 01:43:57,446
Does this mean we're changing how kindergarten enrollment happens?

851
01:43:57,586 --> 01:43:59,626
Is it changing districting?

852
01:44:00,026 --> 01:44:06,488
It's to explore those longer term solutions with the data about what our buildings can handle.

853
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:07,970
Got it.

854
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:08,330
Thanks.

855
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:11,451
I couldn't hear Member Rousseau, so that's why I wanted clarification.

856
01:44:11,471 --> 01:44:13,691
Okay, so there's a motion on the floor.

857
01:44:13,711 --> 01:44:15,472
It's to create a task force.

858
01:44:15,612 --> 01:44:24,694
To create a task force, seconded by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

859
01:44:24,754 --> 01:44:25,494
All those in favor?

860
01:44:26,035 --> 01:44:26,135
Aye.

861
01:44:26,215 --> 01:44:26,875
All those opposed?

862
01:44:26,975 --> 01:44:27,615
Paper passes.

863
01:44:33,673 --> 01:44:34,414
Okay, thank you.

864
01:44:35,214 --> 01:44:36,896
No new business, no reports requested.

865
01:44:36,936 --> 01:44:37,917
We do have a condolence.

866
01:44:38,717 --> 01:44:52,689
Members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Joseph Lacousse, the father of retired vocational graphic arts teacher, Angelo, am I pronouncing that correctly?

867
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:54,070
Lacousse.

868
01:44:55,492 --> 01:44:56,973
If we all may rise for a moment of silence.

869
01:45:11,867 --> 01:45:18,652
Our last and next regular meeting of the Medford School Committee before the summer is June 18th, 2025.

870
01:45:19,293 --> 01:45:25,157
This meeting, that's a Wednesday, next week, next Wednesday, that's at 6 p.m.

871
01:45:25,277 --> 01:45:29,200
to 8 p.m., and it will be held remotely only.

872
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:38,827
So the agenda and link will be on both the city and the school calendar for anybody that wants to tune in or participate.

873
01:45:44,921 --> 01:45:45,842
around communication.

874
01:45:46,083 --> 01:45:46,583
Which Wednesday?

875
01:45:46,603 --> 01:45:48,465
The 11th.

876
01:45:49,146 --> 01:45:49,547
The 11th.

877
01:45:49,607 --> 01:45:50,188
Okay, great.

878
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:54,333
Is there a motion to adjourn?

879
01:45:54,373 --> 01:45:55,294
I'll motion to adjourn.

880
01:45:55,334 --> 01:45:56,215
My microphone's on.

881
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:59,299
Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Branley.

882
01:45:59,559 --> 01:46:00,380
All those in favor?

883
01:46:01,061 --> 01:46:01,762
All those opposed?
