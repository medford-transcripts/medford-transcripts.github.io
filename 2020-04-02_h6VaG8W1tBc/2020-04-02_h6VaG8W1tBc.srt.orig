[SPEAKER_18]: possible after the meeting.

7
00:01:27,557 --> 00:01:28,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, shall I call the roll?

8
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:32,047
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna, I'm trying to unmute Paul.

9
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:42,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Paul, could you just state the email that you'll be in control of if the public has a question or that is relative to the agenda items?

10
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:43,489
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

11
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:55,891
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you have a question you'd like us to be asked, sort of similar to community participation, the email address is medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

12
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:04,475
[SPEAKER_22]: I ask that you include your name, first name and last name, and your address, and then the question.

13
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:13,599
[SPEAKER_22]: I will be asking those questions if I can, and what I mean by that is we are – open meeting law is not completely gone.

14
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,881
[SPEAKER_22]: We can't discuss any topic we want.

15
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:16,741
[SPEAKER_22]: We have an agenda.

16
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:27,827
[SPEAKER_22]: So if the topic is not on the agenda or can't be kind of seen that way, at least, I will respond and tell you that it's not on the agenda and we will

17
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:30,378
[SPEAKER_22]: bring it up at the next meeting.

18
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,040
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's the goal.

19
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:35,761
[SPEAKER_18]: Perfect, thank you.

20
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:38,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we have a Medford School Committee meeting.

21
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:41,785
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a special meeting today, which is Monday, March 30th, 2020.

22
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:45,627
[SPEAKER_18]: We are online Zoom meeting, 5 p.m.

23
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:49,710
[SPEAKER_18]: Member van de Kloot, will you please call the roll?

24
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,270

[SPEAKER_18]: Present.

00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:22,835
[SPEAKER_18]: All present.

42
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:23,835
[SPEAKER_18]: All present.

43
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:26,937
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to salute the flag.

44
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:42,864
[SPEAKER_18]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

45
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so what, Dawn?

46
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:51,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Our superintendent, Maurice Edward Vincent, is present.

47
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,368
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna unmute you.

48
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:56,490
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, would you please give your remarks?

49
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:00,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening everyone.

50
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:05,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to say that I know that this is a difficult situation for all of our families.

51
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:13,420
[SPEAKER_03]: You are trying to balance your job, your family, and helping to provide an education for your children.

52
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:21,622
[SPEAKER_03]: We sympathize as this situation repeats in all of our households around this community and most of the nation.

53
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:23,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate

54
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:28,464
[SPEAKER_03]: The anxiety and the concern you all feel in these uncertain times.

55
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:38,548
[SPEAKER_03]: On behalf of the Medford Public Schools, please know we are here for you and we appreciate your commitment, dedication, support and patience.

56
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:40,608
[SPEAKER_03]: We are Mustang strong.

57
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:46,050
[SPEAKER_03]: The COVID-19 virus forced us into unfamiliar territory.

58
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:50,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Please understand that none of our decisions have been made in haste.

59
00:04:51,789 --> 00:05:05,346
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, we made the decision to close schools for two weeks after many discussions with the mayor, the board of health, our health services director, state officials, and superintendents from surrounding districts.

60
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:17,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Having never done this before, we directed our teachers to provide the students with enrichment studies to complete at home as we took in further information.

61
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:28,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we initially had committed to a two-week closure, word about the virus spreading had all of us beginning to think that the closure could possibly be extended.

62
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:35,338
[SPEAKER_03]: As all of you know, the schools provide so much to our families besides education.

63
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:45,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we had decided to close school, our most immediate necessity was to establish food sites for those in need.

64
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:50,923
[SPEAKER_03]: A good number of our students rely on the Medford Public Schools for breakfast and lunch.

65
00:05:52,008 --> 00:06:04,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Led by the mayor and working with the Food Security Task Force and the Malden YMCA, we were able to put in place grab-and-go lunches for the first week and grab-and-go breakfast and lunch for the second week.

66
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:13,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford is often referred to as an urban rim community, which makes us unique from other school districts in the Commonwealth.

67
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next goal was to develop an appropriate distance learning model for the Medford public schools.

68
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:36,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Administrators have been meeting in earnest numerous times and have contacted fellow educators across the state to discuss and share thoughts and ideas about how to educate during this extraordinary situation.

69
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:45,491
[SPEAKER_03]: All of this work is being done in collaboration with our Medford Teachers Association Union President, Charlene Douglas.

70
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:59,796
[SPEAKER_03]: In discussion with my fellow superintendents and the DESE Commissioner, Mr. Jeff Riley, we are all in agreement that we develop the best educational practices possible under these circumstances.

71
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:05,878
[SPEAKER_03]: To further assist us in this endeavor, the district has sent out a survey to our families

72
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:12,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It is our hope that parents, caregivers, and guardians took a few minutes to complete it.

73
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:19,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Your responses will help us continue to modify our learning model so it works for all of our students.

74
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:31,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, as I said, we've met specifically with the Medford Teachers Association as this situation presents for us a very different manner of teaching.

75
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:40,550
[SPEAKER_03]: We are respectful of our teachers' needs and have met off and on throughout the weeks discussing how remote learning can work under this shutdown.

76
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:51,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet, as the Globe stated on Friday, inequities are everywhere, even in relatively wealthy suburban school districts.

77
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Many families don't have laptops or reliable home internet connections.

78
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:10,948
[SPEAKER_03]: The article continued indicating that even homes that have technology, students often have to compete with a parent who is working remotely or siblings who also have schoolwork to complete.

79
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:19,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I am sure our Medford families as well as our Medford teachers are experiencing these very same issues.

80
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:23,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I must take this opportunity

81
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,703
[SPEAKER_03]: to thank all of those who have been working so hard during this unprecedented time.

82
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:41,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Mayor, who has led us by organizing numerous meetings and bringing all parts of the community together to help to keep this city moving forward during this crisis.

83
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:52,897
[SPEAKER_03]: The business office at Medford High School, who have continued to go into work so that the office could make payroll, pay bills, and handle our grant reporting commitments.

84
00:08:54,535 --> 00:09:03,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Our custodians who daily are inside our buildings, deep cleaning, disinfecting, accepting deliveries and keeping the buildings safe.

85
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:12,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Other strategic secretaries who work in specific departments that are also submitting and contributing to our payroll functions.

86
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:19,491
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanna thank the Medford Family Network who have been assisting families with basic necessities.

87
00:09:20,642 --> 00:09:38,909
[SPEAKER_03]: The media and technology department, who along with principals and assistant principals have sanitized and handed out over or close to 400 phone books to our students, and will continue to do so again this Wednesday, April 1st, from 10 to 2 p.m.

88
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:40,210
[SPEAKER_03]: at all of our schools.

89
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:49,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Our volunteers, we want to thank them who have assisted with the grab-and-go food options at the McGlynn School and other meal sites.

90
00:09:49,987 --> 00:10:03,052
[SPEAKER_03]: The administrators, teachers, and staff who have nonstop been meeting virtually as well as by email and phone to help develop an educational plan for the Medford public schools.

91
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:06,794
[SPEAKER_03]: That includes social emotional learning.

92
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:18,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Our special education and English learner programs have been in overdrive to make sure we are doing all we can as a district to address all of our students' needs.

93
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:26,362
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a great team here in Mustang Country, and that has shown even truer than ever in these past few weeks.

94
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:28,763
[SPEAKER_03]: We are Medford Strong.

95
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:42,693
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really heartwarming to see some of our teachers who have taken a walk by some of their students' homes and left chalk messages on the sidewalks or knocked on the windows to say hello.

96
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:50,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of our administrators, teachers, coaches have put together videos and sent them to their students.

97
00:10:51,253 --> 00:11:00,640
[SPEAKER_03]: CCSR created a wonderful video called hashtag six feet together, which is accessible on our blog and Facebook sites.

98
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:09,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Collectively, our teachers have had to look outside the box to make suggestions on other ways to educate.

99
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:22,927
[SPEAKER_03]: They have suggested that students take nature walks and scavenger hunts, start a journal about this unique time, and do art projects that can be exhibited in their neighborhood or shared on their website.

100
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:26,890
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor is looking for some inspirational artwork.

101
00:11:27,963 --> 00:11:32,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So if students are listening, please post your artwork to her Facebook page.

102
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:37,325
[SPEAKER_03]: These ideas have kept both our students and parents engaged.

103
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:44,366
[SPEAKER_03]: However, in the end, this is a constantly changing and very fluid situation.

104
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:49,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, something that none of us have ever experienced.

105
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:56,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize there are a number of questions out there and we are attempting to answer as many as possible.

106
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:05,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, Dr. Bernadette Riccardelli will present our district's distance learning plan, which will go into effect on Wednesday, April 1st, 2020.

107
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:14,202
[SPEAKER_03]: My hope is that everyone realizes this is a working document that is flexible because this crisis requires it.

108
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:20,446
[SPEAKER_03]: We must work together and not adversely as we enter into this uncharted territory.

109
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:28,672
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, our students are our top priority and we are committed to providing the very, very best for them.

110
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:30,533
[SPEAKER_03]: We are Medford strong.

111
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:41,281
[SPEAKER_03]: So if any families continue to have questions, please do not hesitate to email us at info at medford.k12.ma.us.

112
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:42,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

113
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:47,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Dr. Vincent.

114
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,242
[SPEAKER_18]: That was great.

115
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:51,583
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

116
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:58,846
[SPEAKER_18]: I know we have a number of administrators here, including my finance director, Alicia Nunley.

117
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:01,827
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not sure what order we want to take this in.

118
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:13,131
[SPEAKER_18]: But let's start with the discussion of updated measures to help slow the spread of COVID-19 virus in the city of Medford and the Medford public schools.

119
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:20,821
[SPEAKER_18]: We have Tony Ray, Director of Health Services, available to make a statement and then answer any questions.

120
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:21,401
[SPEAKER_18]: Tony?

121
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:23,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Where are you, Tony?

122
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:27,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

123
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:28,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

124
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:39,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Mary Ann O'Connor was going to address some statistics about what's going on in Medford before I give a statement.

125
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you able to unmute her?

126
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,138
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fine.

127
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,999
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't know if she was on or not.

128
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:48,640
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm here.

129
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:48,700
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

130
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, Marianne.

131
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:50,580
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

132
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:50,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

133
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:51,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, everyone.

134
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:56,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you can see me, and I'm getting better at the Zoom thing.

135
00:13:56,683 --> 00:13:57,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine.

136
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:05,347
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you all for having me here this evening, and I reiterate a lot of what the superintendent said.

137
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:11,110
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been amazing how the community has really stepped up, and particularly the school department, and I thank you.

138
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope everyone's safe and healthy

139
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:16,415
[SPEAKER_07]: keeping those social distancing practices in place.

140
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:22,619
[SPEAKER_07]: The state gave their numbers today around four o'clock.

141
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:26,982
[SPEAKER_07]: State totals, we're looking at about 5,752 cases.

142
00:14:28,463 --> 00:14:32,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, there were eight new deaths today in Massachusetts with a total of 56.

143
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,432
[SPEAKER_07]: The state did announce also, though, that they have been ramping up testing.

144
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:40,354
[SPEAKER_07]: There are up to 43,000 tests to date.

145
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:45,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Today, 700 new cases confirmed.

146
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:53,102
[SPEAKER_07]: So for Medford, we're looking at, to date, 53 cases in our community.

147
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:58,206
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to realize a lot of those, however, have since recovered.

148
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:00,087
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been tracking this since early March.

149
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:03,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a good thing.

150
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:08,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we have been seeing now is kind of consistent with what the state has been seeing.

151
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:12,726
[SPEAKER_07]: The majority of our cases are looking at 20 and 30 year olds.

152
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:16,549
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really making up almost over half of our cases actually.

153
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:26,238
[SPEAKER_07]: But those are the folks, a lot of them who are still working predominantly in the healthcare industry and are still working in those essential services areas.

154
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:34,737
[SPEAKER_07]: And then unfortunately our next highest population are your 70 plus population.

155
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:47,263
[SPEAKER_07]: So speaking of ramping up testing, we were notified today that Lawrence Memorial Hospital is now offering testing at its urgent care center.

156
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:52,285
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see information on that on our website and the city website and social media posts.

157
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:56,256
[SPEAKER_07]: They are all appointment only.

158
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:58,317
[SPEAKER_07]: You do have to call first and get screened.

159
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:12,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to the leadership of the mayor, we've been working with Physician One and Wellington's Circle, and they will be offering drive-through testing as well starting this weekend.

160
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:19,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And that, again, that information is available on the Medford website and social media posts.

161
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,285
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the Board of Health, what we do,

162
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:29,588
[SPEAKER_07]: We are notified typically within a day, if not the same day, of confirmed cases.

163
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:41,892
[SPEAKER_07]: What we then have to do is get in touch with those cases, first of all, to make sure they are isolating, but also to find out what contacts they've had within the last at least 14 days.

164
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:52,495
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have found, which is greatly in part of your efforts, and we thank you, is that those contact numbers have really decreased because people are no longer

165
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:54,534
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in the school setting.

166
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:56,094
[SPEAKER_07]: They're no longer in their work setting.

167
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:58,175
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them, most of them are working remotely.

168
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:00,536
[SPEAKER_07]: So the contacts have greatly reduced.

169
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:07,599
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them are just typically family and household contacts, but those folks are then asked to quarantine as well for 14 days.

170
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:17,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do wanna thank the school and the school committee for your quick and decisive response.

171
00:17:18,843 --> 00:17:22,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Closing the schools when you did, I think has really helped

172
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:31,134
[SPEAKER_07]: We have certainly beyond the window now from school closure of any additional school contacts.

173
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:33,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a great thing because of that.

174
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:37,016
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I do wanna put something out there.

175
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:48,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the superintendent said that staff were still working in the school and administrators are still working hard and that's certainly appreciated, but please, please, please practice social distancing.

176
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there was something on the news today about another district,

177
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:58,940
[SPEAKER_07]: someone had gone into the schools, and now anyone that she came in contact with is quarantined for 14 days.

178
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So please practice social distancing within your admin building and with anyone working with you still going into the buildings.

179
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:09,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, thank you for everything you've done.

180
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:12,166
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also want to thank Toni.

181
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:14,907
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been amazing, very supportive, all her help.

182
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:19,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack, you've been great, and really, thank you for your help.

183
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:25,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And if anybody has any questions, I'd be happy to take them.

184
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:27,337
[SPEAKER_20]: Just let me know.

185
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:33,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you muted, Mayor?

186
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:37,585
[SPEAKER_14]: You're muted, Mayor.

187
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:41,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Kratz.

188
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:42,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes.

189
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:43,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a question.

190
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:47,738
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to the grocery store, I've been hearing a lot of on the news.

191
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:54,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it necessary to wear the gloves in the mask when we're going to the grocery store or the pharmacy?

192
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:08,766
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends on how good you are at what you're doing as far as and I've heard like disposal of these gloves now are popping up on our streets and sidewalks, which is absolutely not acceptable.

193
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:18,632
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't – if you contact with the gloves, you're still going to have that contact on the gloves.

194
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:25,595
[SPEAKER_07]: So unless you're doing it appropriately, it's really – hand washing still is the best and only thing.

195
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:34,557
[SPEAKER_07]: But certainly, if you have the gloves on and you're touching your face with the gloves, it's the same as using your hand to get in contact.

196
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:37,198
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really

197
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard mixed messages on it, but it's really not recommended or necessary.

198
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:43,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

199
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:44,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

200
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:47,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin.

201
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:51,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

202
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:58,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I just actually really wanted to say thank you to Marianne and Tony and all of you guys that have been out on the front line.

203
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Marianne, I know it's been relentless for you.

204
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:07,326
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a really rough couple of weeks for everybody, but I think especially for you and for the folks that you're working closely with.

205
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:12,569
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you so much for your commitment to what you're doing for our city, folks in our city.

206
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

207
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

208
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:14,931
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

209
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:17,353
[SPEAKER_18]: I second that member McLaughlin.

210
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:25,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Tony, Ray, do you have anything to add with regards to this topic?

211
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:27,588
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

212
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:29,549
[SPEAKER_10]: And good evening, everyone.

213
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also applaud everyone's efforts at maintaining healthy habits.

214
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:46,300
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple of things I wanted to mention that the Medford Vocational School and our department donated some supplies to

215
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:51,870
[SPEAKER_11]: the Mass Nurse Association for distribution to some of the hospitals.

216
00:20:52,170 --> 00:21:00,094
[SPEAKER_11]: We also gave some supplies to the Board of Health and today some thermometers to the Medford Fire Department for use on the 911 calls.

217
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:05,277
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're really looking for ways that we can reach into the community.

218
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:12,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the nurses have helped with meal distribution and we are waiting to sign on with the Board of Health for

219
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:18,913
[SPEAKER_11]: to assist with telephone contacts and tracing of contacts.

220
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:33,264
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I would like to stress is that as a school community, we need to adhere to privacy and confidentiality regulations by not disclosing any information.

221
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:41,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if we take it back to the days similar when HIV was emerging and we all assumed that

222
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:46,804
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone had HIV, so we adopted universal precautions.

223
00:21:47,285 --> 00:22:07,475
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to follow a similar model and assume that we all have been exposed, and make sure that you use preventive measures, meaning stay at home, keep your hands clean, keep your facilities clean, maintain social distancing.

224
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:10,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Monitor yourself for any symptoms.

225
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:17,681
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you have symptoms of fever, cough, chest discomfort, you should be notifying your primary care physician.

226
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:26,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Primary care physicians will decide who is able to be tested because there are still regulations around who is able to be tested.

227
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the advice that we're offering.

228
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:39,050
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a number of helplines that are set up at the state, and I know many of these are on our city website, but I'll just name a couple.

229
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:48,332
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them is 2-1-1, and residents can dial 2-1-1 and receive information about COVID-19.

230
00:22:50,032 --> 00:23:01,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Another is the Greater Boston Food Bank, and if you go to gbsb.org, you can find a list of places that are sponsoring meals.

231
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:12,964
[SPEAKER_11]: And lastly, there's a new telehealth company, it's a Massachusetts company that the governor has announced called buoy.com.

232
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:17,065
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's spelled B-U-O-Y dot com.

233
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:22,126
[SPEAKER_11]: And residents can conduct a screening.

234
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:26,687
[SPEAKER_11]: If they have symptoms, they can log on and they can conduct a screening.

235
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:30,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And this telehealth company will advise you

236
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:36,559
[SPEAKER_11]: based on the Department of Public Health algorithms, how to proceed.

237
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:50,762
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm making those known to people, and we hope that people use those resources.

238
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:54,042
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody has any questions, I'm happy to take them.

239
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:56,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Tony.

240
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:00,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get all of that?

241
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:03,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I am having some trouble with my connectivity at home.

242
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:08,190
[SPEAKER_18]: Just the last few words, but otherwise I heard it pretty well.

243
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully everybody else did.

244
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:10,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

245
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:11,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

246
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:12,852
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good update.

247
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:15,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Member Russo.

248
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:16,373
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

249
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:23,656
[SPEAKER_22]: If we're done with that, I would like to make a motion to take some of the items out of order, but I don't want to get ahead of us.

250
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:24,897
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if we are done with that.

251
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:27,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it seems so.

252
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:29,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion for suspension of the rules?

253
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:34,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that, you put in a motion for suspension of the rules?

254
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:36,577
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I am.

255
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:37,437
[SPEAKER_18]: Second.

256
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:39,599
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see, to take what?

257
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:44,281
[SPEAKER_22]: To take number four, then number five, and then number three.

258
00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:46,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

259
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:51,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Mayor, do you mind if I jump off the call now, so the meeting now, so I can get back at it?

260
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, thank you, Miriam.

261
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:54,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for all you've done.

262
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:56,488
[SPEAKER_18]: You've worked around the clock to keep Medford safe.

263
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,269
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate it.

264
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Marianne.

265
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,341
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, take care.

266
00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:01,101
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Marianne.

267
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:01,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Ms.

268
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:02,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Rags.

269
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:08,065
[SPEAKER_18]: OK, so number four, financial updates and review of wages.

270
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:13,427
[SPEAKER_18]: We have Assistant Superintendent of Finance, Christine Patterson, on the line.

271
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:20,910
[SPEAKER_18]: And we also have the CFO from the city of Medford, Alicia Nunley, available as well.

272
00:25:21,451 --> 00:25:23,191
[SPEAKER_08]: So second on the motion?

273
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,333
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, motion to take out of order.

274
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,159
[SPEAKER_18]: by Member Russo, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

275
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,020
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

276
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,241
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

277
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:32,661
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

278
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:33,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

279
00:25:39,027 --> 00:25:40,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, good evening, everyone.

280
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:49,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if you have access to the financial documents that we shared or if I should share my screen.

281
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:52,118
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the preference to review that?

282
00:25:53,283 --> 00:25:55,443
[SPEAKER_18]: We have about 75 people watching, too.

283
00:25:55,543 --> 00:25:58,644
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you could share it on the screen, we'll take it.

284
00:25:59,464 --> 00:25:59,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

285
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:08,566
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, can everybody see my screen?

286
00:26:09,386 --> 00:26:09,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

287
00:26:09,787 --> 00:26:09,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

288
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:10,847
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

289
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:20,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to acclimate you with the information that's in front of you, the document, the 12-page document that's

290
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:26,581
[SPEAKER_05]: numbered page 1 through 12, that is directly from our financial system.

291
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:36,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a report of the school side general fund budget as year-to-date expenses posted from this week of March 26.

292
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:39,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, well, early last week as I was preparing the information.

293
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:47,773
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are the encumbrances, which are amounts held and actual expenditures that have gone through our budget.

294
00:26:48,754 --> 00:27:02,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I go through and get us to the end of this report, which is page 12, I will just scroll down so that we can get to the meat and potatoes of this review.

295
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:11,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we can see, we have our general appropriation, which is the 61,250,000 that is appropriated from the city.

296
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:24,884
[SPEAKER_05]: we have a total of $40,606,143,000 that have been encumbered and expended.

297
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:43,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, as I try to project for the year end through June, we will have 100,000 that will cover some of the deficits that we anticipate we'll have on a given rolling year that cover some of the revolving funds

298
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:49,387
[SPEAKER_05]: that we know we will have deficits that's already been planned as part of this budget, it is just not encumbered.

299
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:53,550
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to show that 100,000 as a subtraction.

300
00:27:54,751 --> 00:28:08,362
[SPEAKER_05]: The payrolls that will be posted that are for normal day-to-day teachers, paraprofessionals, administrators, all of the daily employees that are part of the school budget is the 22,137,104.

301
00:28:12,512 --> 00:28:17,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the regular payments, regular funding programs out of the general budget.

302
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:22,076
[SPEAKER_05]: With all of those expenditures, we have a total expense of $62,843,247.

303
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:25,898
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, that deficit from the total anticipated expenditures from what our appropriation is, $1,937,247.

304
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:50,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know that we've had a $1.8 million revenue gap that we were trying to absorb for this fiscal year.

305
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:58,971
[SPEAKER_05]: As we will go through the additional information, we have a revolving fund offset of 613,911.

306
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:07,894
[SPEAKER_05]: These are just with guesstimate projections right now as the information is available.

307
00:29:08,844 --> 00:29:13,647
[SPEAKER_05]: we still will have a deficit of 979,336.

308
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:25,555
[SPEAKER_05]: As the encumbrance amount begins to reduce or liquidate, I'm using an example here of 500,000.

309
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:37,564
[SPEAKER_05]: That will then further reduce our deficit that we have to make up in terms of closing out our budget for audit purpose and the end of year.

310
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:46,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I just jump to the next page, this is the final page of our fiscal year 20 budget.

311
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:54,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we can see, we just reviewed the general fund appropriation, which was $61,250,000.

312
00:29:56,192 --> 00:30:04,436
[SPEAKER_05]: We also saw that we have a known amount that we needed to cover a gap of $1.8 million.

313
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:09,918
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are in in the midst of trying to

314
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:13,003
[SPEAKER_05]: accommodate and fill that gap.

315
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:29,729
[SPEAKER_05]: As we look at exhibit two, this was the breakdown of what we had anticipated last year during our budget development for fiscal year 20 of what that 1.8 million would look like or be compromised.

316
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had after school programs.

317
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:35,392
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the meet preschool program.

318
00:30:35,972 --> 00:30:38,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the Japanese school and all of these additional

319
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:47,863
[SPEAKER_05]: program areas that are mainly rentals that we're going to offset our budget amount and fill the gap.

320
00:30:49,464 --> 00:31:03,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, as we know, and what we have identified in exhibit three, these are our revenue programs that we still have a gap to fill.

321
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:07,590
[SPEAKER_05]: What I wanted to identify

322
00:31:08,123 --> 00:31:24,427
[SPEAKER_05]: is that of these programs, the afterschool program, as we are no longer providing service and we have been giving credit and offsets for tuition, we will not have enough to cover the 800,000 that we had identified.

323
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:37,410
[SPEAKER_05]: For the MEET preschool program, that is tuition based and is not funded fully for the amount of teachers that we provide for these programs, we will not have enough revenue.

324
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:57,989
[SPEAKER_05]: The Japanese language school that is a tuition based in advance has applied the revenue, but as they are no longer providing services to their schools and their students, they will be looking for a refund for a prorated amount, roughly three months of the school year.

325
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:04,132
[SPEAKER_05]: The Lesley University agreement, we have received that revenue in advance.

326
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:10,273
[SPEAKER_05]: there may be an additional request to have some of that portion refunded.

327
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:24,820
[SPEAKER_05]: The AIC Community College, we roughly have 40,000 that comes in for that program, and given the closure, we will not have that full amount.

328
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:33,045
[SPEAKER_05]: The CASET Italian program is no longer funded, so that 50,000 will not materialize.

329
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:44,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Our circuit breaker, which is offsetting special education costs, we will utilize to the full extent that we have within that program area.

330
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:54,675
[SPEAKER_05]: The Impact Church building rental at the McGlynn, where we will not have sessions available for the last quarter.

331
00:32:55,636 --> 00:33:01,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I would expect a refund to be requested, and we will not have the full amount that we have identified.

332
00:33:02,821 --> 00:33:03,842
[SPEAKER_05]: The Redemption Church,

333
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:09,936
[SPEAKER_05]: another third quarter rental revenue that will not materialize.

334
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:19,342
[SPEAKER_05]: The transportation homeless reimbursement, whatever we receive from the state, we will utilize, so that will be applied.

335
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:25,866
[SPEAKER_05]: The Tibetan church group is a renter, we will not have the full amount to apply.

336
00:33:26,827 --> 00:33:28,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Vocational tuitions,

337
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:34,433
[SPEAKER_05]: The state has identified and recommended that all out-of-district tuitions continue to be paid.

338
00:33:35,454 --> 00:33:38,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So that amount will be materialized.

339
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:47,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So given the 1.8 that should have been offsets, we already go in with a deficit that we need to fill.

340
00:33:49,537 --> 00:33:55,999
[SPEAKER_05]: The revolving activity that's exhibit three, in the first column that you see,

341
00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:59,008
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a carryover from fiscal year 19.

342
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:09,374
[SPEAKER_05]: That means this is a balance that we were able to salvage from prior year amounts and utilize in the current year.

343
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:20,020
[SPEAKER_05]: As we look at our fiscal year 20 expenses versus our revenue, we know that we will have a shortfall.

344
00:34:21,941 --> 00:34:24,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will absolutely need to

345
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:33,583
[SPEAKER_05]: tap into the reserve that we had begin to build in the sense for these programs.

346
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:41,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that is in red, we have to provide a balance for those accounts.

347
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:48,316
[SPEAKER_05]: According to Mass General Law and the auditors, we cannot have a deficit in these revolving accounts.

348
00:34:49,157 --> 00:34:51,679
[SPEAKER_05]: So while we still have a balance,

349
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:56,890
[SPEAKER_05]: that is a net balance of all of the deficits that we still have to cover.

350
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:02,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there are some moving parts with this information.

351
00:35:02,494 --> 00:35:14,802
[SPEAKER_05]: The receipts that we have not seen, again, this is a system generated report that I've tried to name so that it's easier to read, more simplified.

352
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:18,685
[SPEAKER_05]: This column I included so that we could see

353
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:24,543
[SPEAKER_05]: what receipts have not yet been posted or given credit to a particular account.

354
00:35:25,504 --> 00:35:32,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And even with those credits applied, we're still only at a positive balance of $613,911.

355
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:48,758
[SPEAKER_05]: The caveat with this is that any expenses or refunds that we issue out of these programs will be reducing the available balance.

356
00:35:50,057 --> 00:36:00,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we go through and we identify a particular group, we look at the kids corner, we look at the after school program, we look at the community schools.

357
00:36:01,505 --> 00:36:19,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of these programs that might have a positive balance, as we start to issue refunds for tuitions and or rentals and or additional expenditures, these balances will be reduced and we will have to

358
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,549
[SPEAKER_05]: make up the amounts somewhere else.

359
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:48,983
[SPEAKER_05]: So my hope is that with the general budget freeze that we have issued alongside the city's, um, freeze on general spending that we will be able to liquidate more of what is in this encumbrance column and reduce what our deficit without the offsets will be.

360
00:36:52,112 --> 00:37:08,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot give you anything further projected until we get the bills that need to be paid, which we are still proceeding with payments to our out-of-district tuition groups for special education services.

361
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:15,404
[SPEAKER_05]: We are looking at paying the additional amounts that we may need to manage and maintain transportation.

362
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:20,647
[SPEAKER_05]: As we know, prior to the school closures, there was an absolute

363
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:25,399
[SPEAKER_05]: deficit in school bus drivers.

364
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:29,062
[SPEAKER_05]: There weren't enough drivers to maintain all the services.

365
00:37:29,142 --> 00:37:36,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to maintain positive relations with our bus companies so that there are bus drivers when the schools are open.

366
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:48,897
[SPEAKER_05]: So the hope and the intent is that this $2.8 million will further reduce and our deficits can then follow

367
00:37:50,788 --> 00:38:06,294
[SPEAKER_05]: But as we look again towards the revolving accounts, which are the major offsets to our budget deficit, it's very challenging to say the least.

368
00:38:14,518 --> 00:38:16,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do not have a crystal ball.

369
00:38:16,638 --> 00:38:19,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot be any clearer or

370
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:30,752
[SPEAKER_05]: more timely in the intent of what these dollars are and or what the projected amounts may be.

371
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:49,805
[SPEAKER_05]: But the hope is that all of the services that were provided prior to the closure will be received and posted and that we can minimize the additional refunds that maybe can be applied as credits for the next fiscal year.

372
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:08,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Does anybody have any questions before I turn it over to the CFO from the city of Medford?

373
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:10,734
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you, Christine.

374
00:39:11,636 --> 00:39:12,979
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Vander Kloot.

375
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:20,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I just was curious whether we've had any discussions with the Japanese Language School in particular.

376
00:39:21,183 --> 00:39:39,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know in previous years, or over the years, they've sometimes been able to work out something where perhaps they would, in fact, pay for the – continue to make their payments this year, of course impacting that next year, then they would – that would be offset.

377
00:39:39,413 --> 00:39:41,094
[SPEAKER_02]: But have we had any discussions yet?

378
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:48,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would defer that communication with the superintendent.

379
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:56,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they have reached out to her in a capacity that they are looking for a refund for this fiscal year.

380
00:39:56,632 --> 00:40:01,014
[SPEAKER_05]: They are one of the groups that does pay in advance and their payment had been received.

381
00:40:01,874 --> 00:40:11,318
[SPEAKER_05]: But even as I prepared these documents, their request came in to look at calculating a refund for this last fiscal year.

382
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,312
[SPEAKER_05]: portion that they have not been able to have their school in session?

383
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:27,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just be hopeful that we might have a conversation with them and at least negotiate somewhat better terms for us because it's a large number.

384
00:40:28,597 --> 00:40:30,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a large number, but

385
00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:36,004
[SPEAKER_03]: In fairness, that the program has been shut down significantly.

386
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:43,927
[SPEAKER_03]: My preliminary communication was that the parents that have not been able to send their children are requesting refunds.

387
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:53,831
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are going to take it to the table, but they are now being asked to give refunds for the amount of time that school has not been in session.

388
00:40:54,531 --> 00:41:00,374
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are gonna revisit that topic, but that is just one of the,

389
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:03,115
[SPEAKER_03]: revolving accounts, we're not sure.

390
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:11,077
[SPEAKER_03]: We also got requests for refunds from some other revolving accounts.

391
00:41:11,097 --> 00:41:17,379
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are trying to look to see where we can apply credit, whether it's not this year to next year.

392
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:18,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are looking at those options.

393
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I continue?

394
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:34,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the question that many of us will have has to do with classes of employees who work for some of the revolving accounts.

395
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:37,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if you want to address that now.

396
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:39,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of the most important things.

397
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:45,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if we can... According to Howard, we cannot discuss personnel on the floor.

398
00:41:45,922 --> 00:42:00,588
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have executive session next week at our regular meeting on April 6th to discuss specifics about personnel and the specific revolving accounts.

399
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:10,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Until that time, since it's been put off another week, is everybody being paid in the afterschool and program?

400
00:42:12,337 --> 00:42:29,663
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on the timetable of how the payments are structured, meaning the pay periods, the biweekly period ending April 9th will include the two-week payments that were identified for the initial closure.

401
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:34,124
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody will be paid through April 9th.

402
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:37,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kids Corner employees will be- Everybody, everybody.

403
00:42:38,229 --> 00:42:38,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

404
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:41,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

405
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:44,036
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

406
00:42:44,817 --> 00:42:45,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Rousseau.

407
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:47,342
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

408
00:42:49,845 --> 00:42:54,592
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll start with my question before I get to the one from the public.

409
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:56,414
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, never mind.

410
00:42:56,435 --> 00:42:59,078
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to start with the one from the public because it leads right into my question.

411
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:09,386
[SPEAKER_22]: forgive me if I said her name wrong, of Sharon Street, wants to know if there are any savings because there's no busing.

412
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:15,008
[SPEAKER_22]: And before you answer the question, I know that busing was just discussed.

413
00:43:15,388 --> 00:43:29,012
[SPEAKER_22]: And I guess my own opinion is paying the bus company is okay or not okay, depending on what the bus company is doing with the money.

414
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:31,253
[SPEAKER_22]: If they are paying all of their employees,

415
00:43:32,669 --> 00:43:36,392
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's a conversation we can have about whether we should do that anymore.

416
00:43:36,552 --> 00:43:45,299
[SPEAKER_22]: If they are not paying their employees and they've sent them all home on unemployment, then us paying them is offensive in every imaginable way.

417
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:48,441
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm just trying to understand what's going on with the busing.

418
00:43:49,302 --> 00:43:53,304
[SPEAKER_05]: So the busing, we encumber the full contract amount.

419
00:43:54,225 --> 00:44:00,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I appreciate, and in all of the Commonwealth's bus contracts,

420
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:07,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a service provided cost reimbursement type of contract.

421
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:16,448
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if these bus drivers are all forced to unemployment and or find other employment, i.e.

422
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:30,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazon, where they can get a full time job and not worry about any break in service, we lose all of the capability to have bus drivers when our closure ends.

423
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:43,351
[SPEAKER_05]: So the impact is far more consequential than to engage with our transportation providers.

424
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:45,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not just our yellow bus providers.

425
00:44:45,512 --> 00:44:58,175
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our special ed transportation providers as well, because these smaller businesses are the ones that are most likely to have the major impacts that they would go under if they are not

426
00:44:59,598 --> 00:45:05,842
[SPEAKER_05]: provided compensation from their anticipated revenue sources.

427
00:45:06,563 --> 00:45:12,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody expected this type of closure or shutdown as immediate as it happened.

428
00:45:12,907 --> 00:45:21,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody had planned or prepared within contract language to provide for any such dismissal of service.

429
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:24,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the vein of

430
00:45:25,397 --> 00:45:30,619
[SPEAKER_05]: being able to provide service when the school departments are back in session.

431
00:45:31,279 --> 00:45:39,922
[SPEAKER_05]: It is to our best advantage that we negotiate with all of our transportation providers to ensure that we do have transportation.

432
00:45:40,842 --> 00:45:42,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to the closure,

433
00:45:42,602 --> 00:45:47,826
[SPEAKER_05]: there was an extreme shortage of the CDL licensed bus drivers.

434
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:55,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's at the small level of special education, homeless and other transportation, as well as the yellow bus drivers.

435
00:45:56,112 --> 00:45:58,594
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the sense, is there a cost savings?

436
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:02,837
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already accounted for the full contract value.

437
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:10,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would offer that the hope is that we can negotiate with the

438
00:46:11,017 --> 00:46:22,320
[SPEAKER_05]: bus companies that the Department of Education is also trying to facilitate some sort of payment to ensure that these drivers do not look for other employment.

439
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:29,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are faced with an even more challenging process of school bus transportation.

440
00:46:31,185 --> 00:46:32,046
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

441
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:32,867
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

442
00:46:32,947 --> 00:46:34,909
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the very long answer to my question.

443
00:46:34,949 --> 00:46:35,990
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate the detail.

444
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,094
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess my – and I realize that this is still early days.

445
00:46:42,115 --> 00:46:53,306
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just, like, as a taxpayer but also as a member of the school committee, I don't want to find out through a news story, if there's any media left in the world, that

446
00:46:54,651 --> 00:47:02,117
[SPEAKER_22]: We have continued to pay the contract as I think we should, and they let go of all the employees and they put them on unemployment.

447
00:47:03,727 --> 00:47:20,196
[SPEAKER_22]: because, I mean, I'm not saying we have the ability necessarily to prevent that or to even know, but I do think that there's little chance we're gonna be interested in that contract again with that company if they go and just cash a big check and don't pass it on to their employees.

448
00:47:20,216 --> 00:47:26,680
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can tell you that Mass General Law does not allow payment for services without the services conducted.

449
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,722
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what all the school systems in the Commonwealth are facing right now.

450
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:38,606
[SPEAKER_05]: So the answer to your question is no, they have not been given a fat check to go run amok their employees.

451
00:47:38,787 --> 00:47:44,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not know the status of other employees, but unemployment does fall to the employer.

452
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:56,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So regardless of whether their employees are currently on or partial unemployment, that charge is still against whomever their employer was for the last

453
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:02,870
[SPEAKER_05]: quarters that they've been employed, so that would mean whichever transportation company that they were employed with.

454
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:10,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is still an impact regardless of whether we are providing some sort of final payment.

455
00:48:10,663 --> 00:48:23,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I did ask them to provide their final invoice for services up through the March 12th date that they no longer provided school bus transportation, and they have provided that document.

456
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:29,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be one final payment up to this point, and then we are looking for further guidance from

457
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:38,409
[SPEAKER_05]: the Department of Ed and legal in terms of what can be negotiated for a partial payment, if that.

458
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:40,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

459
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:48,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

460
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:49,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

461
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:55,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I just wanted to back up a little bit for folks that are on the call that may or may not have heard.

462
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:57,837
[SPEAKER_08]: But questions are coming in directly

463
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:08,577
[SPEAKER_08]: member Russo, and he is posting that or asking them if they pertain to the agenda because of public meeting law, they have to pertain to the agenda.

464
00:49:08,637 --> 00:49:14,541
[SPEAKER_08]: If they don't pertain to the agenda, I wanted to just ask again, we're keeping a record of them.

465
00:49:14,581 --> 00:49:17,163
[SPEAKER_08]: We're keeping a record of them in any case, right?

466
00:49:17,723 --> 00:49:26,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that we know and are receiving all of your questions and we will in some format, whether it's tonight or next Monday's meeting, be addressing the questions.

467
00:49:26,849 --> 00:49:27,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that accurate?

468
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:31,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Chair?

469
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:43,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I know there's a number of questions that have been put into a Google spreadsheet from a number of committee members.

470
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:55,400
[SPEAKER_18]: So whether we're going to create a process to answer them all and put them on the website or address them through resolutions, depending on what resolutions are on next Monday.

471
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,680
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, actually, that's not the question.

472
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:11,807
[SPEAKER_08]: the constituents, the community members, the viewers, the people that are on the call, what have you, our citizens that are submitting questions via the email link that was sent out to folks.

473
00:50:12,307 --> 00:50:13,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are all being saved.

474
00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:20,311
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have a record of those so that school committee members are able to look at them so that we can address them in some context.

475
00:50:20,371 --> 00:50:21,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that accurate?

476
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,680
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's what I was saying.

477
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:40,104
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I think the superintendent should be allowed, with her administrative staff, to go through those throughout the week, along with the ones that the school committee has, decide, hopefully be able to answer as many as we can, and then we can display them on the website.

478
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:46,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're going to have hundreds of questions between tonight, the school committee, and the public participation.

479
00:50:46,145 --> 00:50:48,906
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that might be hard to get in next Monday.

480
00:50:50,082 --> 00:50:54,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Important ones, I'm sure committee members will put on as resolutions and we'll discuss further.

481
00:50:55,363 --> 00:51:03,684
[SPEAKER_18]: But as a matter of just time and not being on a 12-hour Zoom call, I think our superintendent, along with the administration, can work on answering them.

482
00:51:04,044 --> 00:51:09,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Even if it's Desi's working on this, we should have an answer in three weeks or two weeks or a few days.

483
00:51:09,665 --> 00:51:12,266
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, we will try to get everybody's questions answered.

484
00:51:12,426 --> 00:51:14,306
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that's a goal of our superintendent.

485
00:51:14,646 --> 00:51:14,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, 100%.

486
00:51:14,846 --> 00:51:19,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make sure that they're being documented and saved and make sure that the community knows that that's happening.

487
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:23,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you member Russo for taking those emails and sorting through them.

488
00:51:24,044 --> 00:51:24,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

489
00:51:24,405 --> 00:51:24,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

490
00:51:25,626 --> 00:51:35,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other questions before we allow Alicia Nunley to give just an update, citywide update.

491
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:46,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Alicia Nunley, do you have anything you want to add with regards to, I know the schools are on a high freeze, spending freeze.

492
00:51:46,778 --> 00:51:48,758
[SPEAKER_18]: We have, and the city side are as well.

493
00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:57,201
[SPEAKER_18]: We are also on an overtime needs to be run by our finance department because of all the revolving accounts that we're going to run deficits in.

494
00:51:57,241 --> 00:52:01,942
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you can add to that at all, just to explain the situation on the city side.

495
00:52:02,782 --> 00:52:03,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

496
00:52:03,122 --> 00:52:04,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam mayor.

497
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:05,763
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you school committee members.

498
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:12,844
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know Christine did a great job on detailing, you know, the revolving fund deficits, but I'm also looking closely at the general fund.

499
00:52:12,884 --> 00:52:15,485
[SPEAKER_00]: This is such an unprecedented situation that

500
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:20,363
[SPEAKER_00]: The administration is facing and that no one would have ever thought about that would actually occur.

501
00:52:20,543 --> 00:52:25,428
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to think about, you know, shortage in hotel taxes, shortage in meal tax.

502
00:52:25,448 --> 00:52:27,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, these are other general fund offsets.

503
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:32,134
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to thinking about, okay, I have a $61 million budget, you know, general fund budget.

504
00:52:32,154 --> 00:52:41,063
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a part of that is funded by local receipts and our local receipts are going to be halted because of this, but all the social distancing that COVID-19 has caused.

505
00:52:41,716 --> 00:52:47,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing a lot of analysis on the city side to look at where our revenue deficits are going to run.

506
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:51,445
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in line with the school, the city also has a spending freeze.

507
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:58,411
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing a deep analysis into what kind of revenue shortage we're going to have, whether it be building permits.

508
00:52:58,451 --> 00:53:02,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can't go in and do buildings and inspect buildings because of COVID-19.

509
00:53:03,235 --> 00:53:05,257
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really a lot going on.

510
00:53:06,878 --> 00:53:07,919
[SPEAKER_00]: DOR has given us

511
00:53:08,325 --> 00:53:15,893
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of guidance within the last two weeks as far as how we can get some COVID-19 reimbursable expenses and how to account for that.

512
00:53:16,413 --> 00:53:23,260
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they haven't done is come up to the cities and say, we know you're going to have a revenue shortfall because we're shutting you down for various months.

513
00:53:23,821 --> 00:53:28,445
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's an issue that we're really trying to get a hold of and figure out.

514
00:53:28,465 --> 00:53:31,028
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

515
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:35,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Any questions for Alyse Nunley, member Rousseau?

516
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:37,852
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I actually had a question for Christine again.

517
00:53:37,972 --> 00:53:40,154
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, go ahead.

518
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:42,761
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

519
00:53:42,781 --> 00:53:46,243
[SPEAKER_22]: Patterson, are we continuing to pay?

520
00:53:46,443 --> 00:54:02,311
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I know the answer based on your answer related to busing, but I'm concerned about the collaboratives and the private out-of-district placements where we pay them monthly based on the number of days the students actually are at the schools.

521
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:06,392
[SPEAKER_22]: If they're not going to the schools, short collaborative shutdown, for instance,

522
00:54:08,914 --> 00:54:13,616
[SPEAKER_22]: On the surface, it's like, if they're not providing services, why would we pay them?

523
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:20,778
[SPEAKER_22]: On the other hand, the day after we all start this big engine back up, they won't be in business anymore.

524
00:54:21,998 --> 00:54:30,421
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm very concerned about, what is the principle about, do we just pay people even if they're not providing services?

525
00:54:30,921 --> 00:54:34,163
[SPEAKER_22]: Because when this is all over, we're gonna need them to still be there.

526
00:54:38,965 --> 00:54:51,271
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with the DESE and the MASBO listservs, and we've been on numerous Zoom sessions as well, we've already gotten guidance for the collaboratives and the out-of-district placements.

527
00:54:51,731 --> 00:55:03,776
[SPEAKER_05]: These day programs and the collaboratives, we have already identified that those would continue to be paid similar to as our Chapter 70 is coming into the regular school departments.

528
00:55:04,357 --> 00:55:07,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's already legislation in place to provide

529
00:55:07,996 --> 00:55:15,201
[SPEAKER_05]: a provision for tuitions in advance for our collaboratives that we know we're going to have placements on.

530
00:55:15,581 --> 00:55:19,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are paying as they are providing the invoices.

531
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:23,166
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not paying in advance without having anything documented.

532
00:55:23,226 --> 00:55:27,790
[SPEAKER_05]: We are paying what they are sending in and submitting for those payments.

533
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:32,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, this is going back to our departments that are still

534
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:47,188
[SPEAKER_05]: the essential team that is coming in and checking the mail and getting those invoices processed for those priority services that maintain the day-to-day functions and supports for students on a regular basis.

535
00:55:47,528 --> 00:55:50,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are paying those invoices.

536
00:55:51,153 --> 00:55:51,433
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

537
00:56:26,161 --> 00:56:26,701
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

538
00:56:27,682 --> 00:56:28,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you hear me?

539
00:56:29,704 --> 00:56:30,364
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, geez.

540
00:56:31,706 --> 00:56:32,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

541
00:56:32,286 --> 00:56:36,770
[SPEAKER_18]: I said thank you to Christine Patterson and Alicia Nunley for the explanations.

542
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,131
[SPEAKER_18]: They were very helpful.

543
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:42,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for providing that, Christine, the deficit analysis.

544
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:46,798
[SPEAKER_18]: And while we're on the suspension of the rules, if there's no other questions on finances,

545
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:53,709
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go to recommendation to approve the cancellation of the middle school eighth grade New York City trip.

546
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:57,775
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to just get an update on that from assistant superintendent, Dr. Peter Cushing.

547
00:56:59,245 --> 00:56:59,705
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

548
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:16,930
[SPEAKER_21]: Over the past couple of weeks, even before, I'd say late February, early March, as we had the experience with the international trip at the high school, I had the middle school principals start looking at ways that we could limit our exposure for our families.

549
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:23,372
[SPEAKER_21]: Member van de Kloot had mentioned that we did not have insurance on the New York City field trip.

550
00:57:24,853 --> 00:57:31,559
[SPEAKER_21]: As you know, an analysis of that insurance actually revealed that that $57 would have covered very little for our families, if anything.

551
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:40,507
[SPEAKER_21]: The $57 of that field trip, of that insurance, would not have covered the pandemic, as an example.

552
00:57:42,264 --> 00:58:02,095
[SPEAKER_21]: And as of today, we received an update today from the tour company that all $1,500 of the McGlynn Middle School's money will be credited towards next year and all $2,000 of the Andrews Middle School money will be credited towards next year as well.

553
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:05,837
[SPEAKER_21]: Those were in theory non-refundable deposits.

554
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:07,478
[SPEAKER_21]: We had anticipated

555
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:16,810
[SPEAKER_21]: We had anticipated being able to refund all parents' money with the exception of their initial $20 that they put down.

556
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:22,798
[SPEAKER_21]: At this time, we should be able to refund all monies to all parents.

557
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,980
[SPEAKER_21]: over the coming weeks and months.

558
00:58:27,021 --> 00:58:37,746
[SPEAKER_21]: The challenge is the writing of those checks out of student activities accounts is a very challenging piece because the checks need to be reissued to the people who wrote them.

559
00:58:39,087 --> 00:58:48,511
[SPEAKER_21]: And so that's something that we'll probably have to wait until we are back up and running to be able to have people in to be able to handle those types of refunds.

560
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:52,333
[SPEAKER_21]: But we will be able to refund everybody's money.

561
00:58:58,062 --> 00:58:59,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Kratz.

562
00:59:00,363 --> 00:59:00,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

563
00:59:00,883 --> 00:59:01,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

564
00:59:01,323 --> 00:59:03,504
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great news, Dr. Cushing.

565
00:59:03,584 --> 00:59:12,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know it seems like a lifetime ago for everybody, but I just wanted to also confirm that the money from the France trip is refunded with the exception of the $50.

566
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:14,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that right?

567
00:59:14,087 --> 00:59:19,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought there was an email that went out amongst all of this happenings that

568
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:36,792
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, in our last meeting, we were also talking about refunds for field trips and that that money was going to be everybody was very upset, obviously, understandably about that money being refunded and somewhere along the line, the email came across our path, just before I Yeah, no, I was gonna say, um,

569
00:59:41,118 --> 00:59:44,902
[SPEAKER_03]: For our regular meeting, we will have that officially on the agenda.

570
00:59:44,962 --> 00:59:49,146
[SPEAKER_03]: We are able to get a refund.

571
00:59:49,306 --> 00:59:49,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not $50.

572
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:50,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different amount.

573
00:59:51,288 --> 01:00:02,579
[SPEAKER_03]: But we will be able to present that at next Monday's meeting, April 6, during our regular meeting, an update for all parents on what's happening with the Paris-France trip.

574
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:09,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's much better than what we originally thought it was, but it's not as good as just $50.

575
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:11,864
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's much better than what it originally was.

576
01:00:12,304 --> 01:00:14,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we will have that for next Monday's regular meeting.

577
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:15,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

578
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,446
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

579
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:19,447
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Kretz, then Member van de Kloot.

580
01:00:21,934 --> 01:00:24,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for the update.

581
01:00:24,216 --> 01:00:29,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the very same question that Melanie had, and I guess we'll find out next week.

582
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:39,546
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's great news to hear that the middle school students and their families, with that trip, it's going to work out for them.

583
01:00:40,566 --> 01:00:40,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

584
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,889
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a redundant question, so Melanie already asked the question.

585
01:00:44,009 --> 01:00:44,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

586
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:47,511
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

587
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:48,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Member van de Kloot.

588
01:00:49,135 --> 01:01:00,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is the time of year where there are various other activities that entail contracts, for example, for the junior and senior prom, perhaps for some of the senior activities.

589
01:01:01,723 --> 01:01:05,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that money already been paid out?

590
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:07,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's take one of the proms, for example.

591
01:01:08,268 --> 01:01:15,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that just so that we don't, so our students don't lose that money?

592
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are we in the process around those type of expenses?

593
01:01:22,216 --> 01:01:30,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on the internal list that I saw of questions, we can be prepared to respond to that for next week's regular meeting.

594
01:01:30,658 --> 01:01:30,918
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

595
01:01:32,658 --> 01:01:33,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

596
01:01:35,518 --> 01:01:39,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a motion on the floor if we have no further questions?

597
01:01:40,259 --> 01:01:49,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion by member van de Kloet, seconded by member Kretz to cancel the middle school eighth grade New York City trip.

598
01:01:51,002 --> 01:01:56,363
[SPEAKER_18]: favor unless we can do a roll call if you want.

599
01:01:57,263 --> 01:01:57,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

600
01:01:58,404 --> 01:01:58,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

601
01:01:59,464 --> 01:02:00,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kritz?

602
01:02:00,644 --> 01:02:00,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

603
01:02:01,464 --> 01:02:02,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin?

604
01:02:03,225 --> 01:02:03,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

605
01:02:04,325 --> 01:02:05,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McStone?

606
01:02:07,106 --> 01:02:07,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

607
01:02:08,706 --> 01:02:08,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

608
01:02:09,486 --> 01:02:10,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think she can hear.

609
01:02:11,487 --> 01:02:14,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you.

610
01:02:14,588 --> 01:02:15,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau?

611
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:16,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

612
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:18,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Bandolier?

613
01:02:18,488 --> 01:02:18,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

614
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:19,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor Luongo-Kern?

615
01:02:20,229 --> 01:02:20,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

616
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:23,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

617
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:25,816
[SPEAKER_18]: The trip is unfortunately canceled.

618
01:02:28,818 --> 01:02:35,203
[SPEAKER_18]: Next order of business is tentative distance learning plan for the Medford Public Schools.

619
01:02:35,864 --> 01:02:40,708
[SPEAKER_18]: And that discussion is going to be led by Director of Curriculum, Dr. Bernadette Riccidelli.

620
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:43,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Doctor.

621
01:02:44,346 --> 01:02:49,513
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee and Medford Public Schools community.

622
01:02:50,894 --> 01:02:57,943
[SPEAKER_19]: So I am here tonight to report on the distance learning plan that a team of us put together.

623
01:02:58,947 --> 01:03:01,088
[SPEAKER_19]: And indeed, it did take a team.

624
01:03:01,768 --> 01:03:04,850
[SPEAKER_19]: So over the past week, I've been working with administrators.

625
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:08,611
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been working with Charlene Douglas, the MTA.

626
01:03:09,812 --> 01:03:13,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Peter Cushing reached out to parents with that survey.

627
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:16,695
[SPEAKER_19]: We've reached out to different districts.

628
01:03:16,715 --> 01:03:26,460
[SPEAKER_19]: And we put together a plan based on the input and based on the data available to us.

629
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,562
[SPEAKER_19]: So the school committee should have received a report.

630
01:03:31,622 --> 01:03:33,103
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a 14 page report.

631
01:03:34,003 --> 01:03:37,025
[SPEAKER_19]: This report is not out in the community yet, but it will be.

632
01:03:37,145 --> 01:03:41,026
[SPEAKER_19]: We were working on it as late as three o'clock this afternoon.

633
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:50,651
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be made available to the public by tomorrow, if not later this evening.

634
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,280
[SPEAKER_19]: So it is a lengthy report.

635
01:03:53,681 --> 01:04:01,043
[SPEAKER_19]: In the report, we spent a lot of time talking about the rationale as to why we came to the plan that we did.

636
01:04:02,143 --> 01:04:03,424
[SPEAKER_19]: So I am going to go through it.

637
01:04:03,604 --> 01:04:10,146
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to try to go through it, be thorough with it, but I will be cognizant of the time.

638
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:12,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Take your time.

639
01:04:13,827 --> 01:04:14,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

640
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:26,642
[SPEAKER_19]: So this plan is meant to support the school community, including students, families, teachers, and administrators, as they work through this challenge of off-campus or distance education.

641
01:04:27,383 --> 01:04:42,087
[SPEAKER_19]: The plan establishes a structure and expectations from which each of those different groups, students, families, teachers, and administrators, will work to ensure an appropriate learning experience for students.

642
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:54,695
[SPEAKER_19]: We acknowledge that a distance education plan cannot replace the in-person and the personalized approach of our professional teacher, teaching and administrative staff.

643
01:04:55,595 --> 01:05:04,239
[SPEAKER_19]: But we do believe that this plan provides a supportive and flexible framework from which to deliver an equitable learning opportunity.

644
01:05:06,589 --> 01:05:11,071
[SPEAKER_19]: So we took a look, I mentioned a moment ago that we used several different documents.

645
01:05:11,171 --> 01:05:20,554
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the most important documents that we used was the guidance that the Commissioner of Education issued last week.

646
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:24,757
[SPEAKER_19]: And in this communication, we did buy some guiding principles.

647
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:29,519
[SPEAKER_19]: So we kind of adapted it for our guiding principles, so I'm going to go through those at this point.

648
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:34,562
[SPEAKER_19]: As a district, we are concerned about the well-being of our entire school community.

649
01:05:35,242 --> 01:05:44,747
[SPEAKER_19]: Students and staff have been thrust into this period of great uncertainty and stress and, therefore, are working within a less-than-ideal teaching and learning environment.

650
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:55,511
[SPEAKER_19]: Our planning team has taken into consideration, has created a framework that balances the need for flexibility with the need and the responsibility to educate our students.

651
01:05:56,192 --> 01:06:05,496
[SPEAKER_19]: Our approach not only focuses on academic concerns, but also takes into consideration the physical, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students, families, and staff.

652
01:06:06,759 --> 01:06:09,923
[SPEAKER_19]: This crisis is going to affect families in so many different ways.

653
01:06:10,263 --> 01:06:13,588
[SPEAKER_19]: For example, some families will be adjusting to life without a paycheck.

654
01:06:14,128 --> 01:06:18,293
[SPEAKER_19]: Others may contract the virus and therefore be unable to engage in teaching and learning.

655
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:24,801
[SPEAKER_19]: And others may be dealing with the social emotional challenges of being limited in their movement outside the home.

656
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:36,558
[SPEAKER_19]: While some families may be able to provide a highly conducive learning environment for their child or their children, it is probable that not all families will be able to provide those same opportunities.

657
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:40,081
[SPEAKER_19]: As a parent myself, I'm struggling with this.

658
01:06:40,221 --> 01:06:45,766
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm struggling with balancing my work and balancing what my children need.

659
01:06:45,826 --> 01:06:48,728
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would imagine that that is happening all over the district.

660
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:59,381
[SPEAKER_19]: We are mindful of those inequities and have created a plan that allows for equitable learning opportunities to occur despite those differences.

661
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:06,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Maintaining connections between staff and students is very important, especially for the most vulnerable members of our school communities.

662
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:13,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Ongoing communication between school and home is a priority for the district, and you will see that embedded in the plan.

663
01:07:13,884 --> 01:07:18,885
[SPEAKER_19]: The expectation is for that communication to be clear, regular, and ongoing.

664
01:07:20,925 --> 01:07:28,934
[SPEAKER_19]: So as I said, nothing can replace the in-person schooling experience and we should not expect that remote learning can replace the traditional school day.

665
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:41,188
[SPEAKER_19]: With our schools now closed until at least May 4th, we have an obligation to engage our students in an equitable and meaningful manner through appropriately structured educational activities.

666
01:07:42,747 --> 01:07:50,695
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, we realize that distance learning is not the same thing as online learning, and that not all learning activities need to involve screen time.

667
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,117
[SPEAKER_19]: That is really important.

668
01:07:52,517 --> 01:08:05,070
[SPEAKER_19]: Much of the conversations that have been taking place online in different communities equate distance learning or remote learning with time on the screen, and Medford is not necessarily taking that approach.

669
01:08:07,142 --> 01:08:13,607
[SPEAKER_19]: We are encouraging our staff to be creative with their assignments, using this time to embrace new venues for the delivery of instruction.

670
01:08:15,068 --> 01:08:19,792
[SPEAKER_19]: As a school community is important to emphasize the need for flexibility in the design of a plan.

671
01:08:20,512 --> 01:08:33,282
[SPEAKER_19]: The district followed guidelines provided by the commissioner and used it as its framework that educators need to be cognizant of the various individual students experiences during this no school period.

672
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:55,072
[SPEAKER_19]: So to quote the commissioner, he wrote in his guidance, individual student experience will vary depending on student age, individual and family needs, access and capacity for remote learning, including access to technology and the internet, and the ongoing health of students, families, and staff.

673
01:08:55,873 --> 01:09:01,875
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, it is possible that families are going to get sick.

674
01:09:03,491 --> 01:09:05,733
[SPEAKER_19]: We hope it doesn't happen, but that certainly is possible.

675
01:09:06,793 --> 01:09:11,216
[SPEAKER_19]: The next section in this report does reference various federal and state guidance.

676
01:09:11,556 --> 01:09:15,419
[SPEAKER_19]: So those documents will be available to those people at home who are listening.

677
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:20,903
[SPEAKER_19]: There are links to various state guidance and federal guidance documents.

678
01:09:22,698 --> 01:09:25,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on to technology systems.

679
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:34,085
[SPEAKER_19]: So as you know, the district has been busy since the close of school distributing Chromebooks out to students.

680
01:09:34,845 --> 01:09:38,467
[SPEAKER_19]: We will continue options for that.

681
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:41,989
[SPEAKER_19]: We want to make sure that people have what they need in order to work.

682
01:09:44,801 --> 01:09:51,726
[SPEAKER_19]: So the district will continue to use technology to serve as an important means of communication to students and staff.

683
01:09:52,606 --> 01:10:02,033
[SPEAKER_19]: As you know, the district has adopted Google as its platform and therefore expects the Google suite of programs to be the primary means of technological communication within the school community.

684
01:10:03,526 --> 01:10:13,532
[SPEAKER_19]: While many of the Medford staff are trained in Google and its various program capabilities, we are aware that there may be some staff who would benefit from additional training.

685
01:10:14,292 --> 01:10:24,118
[SPEAKER_19]: Therefore, we are planning, and we actually have already planned for various webinars be available to the community to support the use of Google.

686
01:10:24,878 --> 01:10:27,900
[SPEAKER_19]: Those opportunities will be made shortly.

687
01:10:29,161 --> 01:10:32,603
[SPEAKER_19]: So as you know, we have Gmail, we have Google Classroom,

688
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:35,140
[SPEAKER_19]: and we have Google Meets.

689
01:10:36,222 --> 01:10:41,715
[SPEAKER_19]: All three, part of that Google Suite, will be instrumental in the communication that occurs.

690
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,020
[SPEAKER_19]: There is also Zoom.

691
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,001
[SPEAKER_19]: We are using Zoom this evening.

692
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:47,681
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Zoom is a great tool.

693
01:10:48,502 --> 01:10:50,282
[SPEAKER_19]: However, there are some drawbacks.

694
01:10:50,342 --> 01:10:52,343
[SPEAKER_19]: There are some privacy issues.

695
01:10:53,043 --> 01:11:05,106
[SPEAKER_19]: So while we acknowledge that there are some great aspects to using Zoom, it's not our preferred means of communication for teacher to student communication.

696
01:11:05,486 --> 01:11:07,527
[SPEAKER_19]: However, we're not prohibiting it.

697
01:11:08,027 --> 01:11:11,828
[SPEAKER_19]: We just are advocating the use of Google over Zoom.

698
01:11:12,788 --> 01:11:20,794
[SPEAKER_19]: If teachers do opt to use them, we just want them to be cognizant of the various privacy issues and security issues out there.

699
01:11:23,896 --> 01:11:27,798
[SPEAKER_19]: So following along, going over to the plan implementation process.

700
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:37,625
[SPEAKER_19]: So soon after the close of school beginning on March 13th, we began, teachers and administrators began to develop enrichment activities for their students.

701
01:11:38,446 --> 01:11:41,728
[SPEAKER_19]: So this first two weeks was focused on enrichment.

702
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:47,392
[SPEAKER_19]: So now we're faced with this longer term, no school.

703
01:11:47,793 --> 01:11:57,840
[SPEAKER_19]: Our expectations have shifted from that of enrichment to that of a deeper review and refinement of curriculum that has already been taught.

704
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,981
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a very important point.

705
01:12:00,021 --> 01:12:01,362
[SPEAKER_19]: We're shifting from enrichment

706
01:12:02,263 --> 01:12:06,405
[SPEAKER_19]: to a deeper review and refinement of the curriculum that has already been taught.

707
01:12:06,825 --> 01:12:13,469
[SPEAKER_19]: This new guidance, received from the Commissioner of Education on March 26th, has helped to inform the formulation of our plan.

708
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:17,811
[SPEAKER_19]: It really forms a foundation of where we want our teachers to go.

709
01:12:20,092 --> 01:12:27,236
[SPEAKER_19]: This plan will be in effect, it is Wednesday, not Friday, April 3rd, that you may be looking at, but it is Wednesday, April 1st.

710
01:12:27,336 --> 01:12:29,397
[SPEAKER_19]: We are looking to begin this plan.

711
01:12:31,202 --> 01:12:34,044
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're looking at the drivers of this distance model.

712
01:12:34,064 --> 01:12:37,367
[SPEAKER_19]: So we took what was in our core behavioral themes.

713
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:41,209
[SPEAKER_19]: And from that we're taking out the themes of care.

714
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:42,911
[SPEAKER_19]: We care about our students.

715
01:12:42,931 --> 01:12:44,272
[SPEAKER_19]: We care about our staff.

716
01:12:44,772 --> 01:12:45,973
[SPEAKER_19]: We care what happens.

717
01:12:46,013 --> 01:12:47,334
[SPEAKER_19]: We want them to be healthy.

718
01:12:48,803 --> 01:12:50,044
[SPEAKER_19]: We look at communication.

719
01:12:50,444 --> 01:12:53,666
[SPEAKER_19]: We want that ongoing communication to occur.

720
01:12:54,786 --> 01:12:56,427
[SPEAKER_19]: We're cognizant of equity.

721
01:12:56,687 --> 01:13:04,192
[SPEAKER_19]: We're cognizant that not everyone has the same environment at home that may be conducive to great learning.

722
01:13:04,212 --> 01:13:10,575
[SPEAKER_19]: And we are cognizant of the fact that we need to be flexible.

723
01:13:10,615 --> 01:13:17,479
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to be flexible in so many different ways in order to provide for an equitable learning environment for students.

724
01:13:21,657 --> 01:13:23,378
[SPEAKER_19]: So moving on here.

725
01:13:23,478 --> 01:13:26,679
[SPEAKER_19]: So our drivers, we separated this out into drivers.

726
01:13:26,759 --> 01:13:32,280
[SPEAKER_19]: So first driver, we want to engage our students in meaningful and productive activities.

727
01:13:32,961 --> 01:13:42,023
[SPEAKER_19]: The engagement of students will occur through caring, meaningful, and productive learning activities for approximately half the length of a regular school day.

728
01:13:42,704 --> 01:13:43,744
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's important.

729
01:13:44,404 --> 01:13:47,445
[SPEAKER_19]: That guidance was sent out by the Commissioner of Education.

730
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:53,833
[SPEAKER_19]: activities should occur for approximately half the length of a regular school day.

731
01:13:54,813 --> 01:14:00,935
[SPEAKER_19]: This learning should take place through a flexible combination of educator-directed learning and student-directed learning.

732
01:14:03,836 --> 01:14:15,880
[SPEAKER_19]: Upon recommendation of the Massachusetts Department of Education, the focus of instruction should be on reinforcing skills already taught this year and applying and deepening these skills.

733
01:14:17,808 --> 01:14:26,504
[SPEAKER_19]: In some cases, teachers and students may wish to continue with new material, particularly in the upper level secondary courses, but really the focus should be.

734
01:14:27,855 --> 01:14:33,258
[SPEAKER_19]: on reinforcing the skills already taught this year and applying and deepening those skills.

735
01:14:34,059 --> 01:14:43,724
[SPEAKER_19]: Distance learning encompasses a wide variety of flexible learning opportunities and does not necessarily need to occur in real time or live, in other words.

736
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:56,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Instructional tools include group video or hangout sessions, email, work packets, projects, reading lists, online learning platforms, and other resources to engage with students.

737
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,955
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, this is coming from the Commissioner of Education.

738
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:05,744
[SPEAKER_19]: So just to reiterate, all learning does not need to occur through screen time.

739
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,887
[SPEAKER_19]: It does not need to occur live.

740
01:15:08,347 --> 01:15:10,931
[SPEAKER_19]: It can, but it does not have to.

741
01:15:14,859 --> 01:15:18,781
[SPEAKER_19]: We are looking to provide an equitable learning and assessment foundation.

742
01:15:19,122 --> 01:15:24,305
[SPEAKER_19]: Students will receive supportive and meaningful feedback from their teacher, so we get going back to communication.

743
01:15:24,925 --> 01:15:29,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Per guidance from the Department of Education, students will be graded on a pass-fail basis.

744
01:15:30,388 --> 01:15:43,216
[SPEAKER_19]: By grading students on a pass-fail basis, the district will be providing an incentive to students to complete the work while working within the challenging and ever-changing environment in an equitable way.

745
01:15:44,323 --> 01:15:56,208
[SPEAKER_19]: In addition, per the Department of Education, all educational opportunities that are offered to the general student population must be accessible to all students, including those with disabilities.

746
01:15:56,608 --> 01:16:02,350
[SPEAKER_19]: That includes those on IEPs and 504 plans and those with limited English proficiency.

747
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:07,212
[SPEAKER_19]: Joan Bowen, Director of Pupil Services and

748
01:16:07,759 --> 01:16:11,180
[SPEAKER_19]: Paul Texerra, the director of English learners are here.

749
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:15,341
[SPEAKER_19]: Their input is certainly in this plan.

750
01:16:15,861 --> 01:16:20,482
[SPEAKER_19]: And at the end of this, they'll be here to answer questions as I will.

751
01:16:24,803 --> 01:16:27,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Supportive and informative communication.

752
01:16:27,623 --> 01:16:32,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Students and families will receive ongoing communication from the teacher and the school community.

753
01:16:32,804 --> 01:16:35,985
[SPEAKER_19]: All staff will hold a minimum of two office hours per week.

754
01:16:37,256 --> 01:16:42,282
[SPEAKER_19]: and families can communicate with teachers through Google Hangout email or by phone.

755
01:16:43,003 --> 01:16:49,412
[SPEAKER_19]: All staff will share their designed office hours with families by the end of the first week of the distance learning plan.

756
01:16:51,627 --> 01:17:03,798
[SPEAKER_19]: So a lot of what I've gone over forms the foundation, again, based on what the commissioner has said, based on what other districts are doing, and based on what we feel we want to do in Medford.

757
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:08,262
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we come down with some more specific guidelines for our staff.

758
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,024
[SPEAKER_19]: Now our staff has not heard this.

759
01:17:11,045 --> 01:17:12,586
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the first time it's coming out.

760
01:17:14,688 --> 01:17:15,969
[SPEAKER_19]: So for the staff that are

761
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:18,381
[SPEAKER_19]: are online with us tonight.

762
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:26,773
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the first time, but again, this will be posted online for you and your respective principals and or directors will be reinforcing this with you.

763
01:17:28,255 --> 01:17:33,121
[SPEAKER_19]: During this time of change from regular routine, students may express feelings of anxiety and fear.

764
01:17:34,227 --> 01:17:36,669
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's not just students, those are the adults as well.

765
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:46,937
[SPEAKER_19]: As the child's teacher, he or she is a familiar presence in their lives and is therefore best positioned to provide the student with this sense of normalcy and continuity.

766
01:17:48,018 --> 01:17:54,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Staff members are going to play a very active role in the teaching and learning that will occur for the duration of the distance learning plan.

767
01:17:55,463 --> 01:18:01,428
[SPEAKER_19]: So now I'm gonna go over the bullets that are central to these guidelines for staff.

768
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:07,843
[SPEAKER_19]: And some of this is repetitive, but I think it is worth saying it over.

769
01:18:08,304 --> 01:18:14,968
[SPEAKER_19]: The focus of instruction should be on reinforcing skills already taught this school year and applying and deepening those skills.

770
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:20,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Secondly, not all of the learning activities need to include screen time.

771
01:18:20,352 --> 01:18:29,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Activities can be designed so that students work on them at their pace, keeping in mind the work should take half the time as a regular school session.

772
01:18:31,514 --> 01:18:41,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Third, at the elementary level, teachers and specialists should follow a regular in-school schedule when opting to engage in live online instruction.

773
01:18:42,071 --> 01:18:46,498
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, there is no requirement to engage in that live online instruction.

774
01:18:48,414 --> 01:18:55,760
[SPEAKER_19]: We know it's been happening and we think that it will continue, but we're not requiring it to happen.

775
01:18:56,420 --> 01:19:04,347
[SPEAKER_19]: So for example, if the Italian teacher wants to engage student in a lesson, she should conduct the lesson at the day and time the class would typically meet.

776
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:10,572
[SPEAKER_19]: So if it's Wednesday at one o'clock, we're asking that that happen at that time.

777
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,815
[SPEAKER_19]: What we've been experiencing primarily at the high school

778
01:19:14,503 --> 01:19:19,804
[SPEAKER_19]: is that when teachers were doing live sessions with their students, there was a conflict.

779
01:19:19,844 --> 01:19:23,485
[SPEAKER_19]: You'd have two teachers who were scheduling a session at the same time.

780
01:19:24,146 --> 01:19:34,749
[SPEAKER_19]: So Principal DeLeva brought that to my attention and really, really advocated for us to work on a schedule so that there were none of these conflicts if there is online instruction.

781
01:19:37,032 --> 01:19:49,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, similar at the middle and high school level, if the teacher wants to engage in live online communication, this should occur at the time period that the class would typically meet.

782
01:19:51,358 --> 01:19:59,762
[SPEAKER_19]: So we will be publishing the six-day cycle, that A, B, C, D, E, F day, that will be available for teachers.

783
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:06,345
[SPEAKER_19]: Paul DeLeva and I talked about that this morning, so we will put that together and it'll be a link on this

784
01:20:06,921 --> 01:20:07,761
[SPEAKER_19]: on this page.

785
01:20:09,422 --> 01:20:11,963
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, live online lessons do not need to happen.

786
01:20:11,983 --> 01:20:13,824
[SPEAKER_19]: We think they probably will.

787
01:20:14,644 --> 01:20:19,586
[SPEAKER_19]: But if they are scheduled, they should be done with this guidance in mind so that students do not experience conflicts.

788
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:27,972
[SPEAKER_19]: Next point, students should be able to engage in learning activities with a little to no parent or caregiver support.

789
01:20:28,332 --> 01:20:33,913
[SPEAKER_19]: So the rationale behind this was that many parents are working from home themselves.

790
01:20:34,534 --> 01:20:47,597
[SPEAKER_19]: So there may be situations where a parent can give the child a lot of support, but there are gonna be a lot of situations where that's not gonna be able to happen.

791
01:20:47,937 --> 01:20:49,838
[SPEAKER_19]: So we want the child to be able to work

792
01:20:51,873 --> 01:20:57,340
[SPEAKER_19]: independently, and if they're able to get additional support at home, that would be great.

793
01:20:59,243 --> 01:21:08,295
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on, any educational opportunity offered to the general student population, including enrichment activities and resources, must be made accessible to students with disabilities.

794
01:21:12,198 --> 01:21:13,920
[SPEAKER_19]: Project-based learning is encouraged.

795
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:18,684
[SPEAKER_19]: However, it should not require materials that are not easily accessible within the home.

796
01:21:18,984 --> 01:21:24,990
[SPEAKER_19]: So projects are great, but people cannot run out to the store to get materials.

797
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:34,219
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're asking staff, if you want to engage students in projects, not to require materials outside the home.

798
01:21:36,545 --> 01:21:39,048
[SPEAKER_19]: New assignments do not need to be given every day.

799
01:21:40,089 --> 01:21:44,934
[SPEAKER_19]: They can be given one of the week with the expectation for work to be completed later on in that week.

800
01:21:47,617 --> 01:21:51,261
[SPEAKER_19]: Next point, regular communication between teachers and students is expected.

801
01:21:53,231 --> 01:22:04,598
[SPEAKER_19]: As I mentioned earlier, all staff are asked to designate two hours per week to what we call office hours so that students and families can communicate with teachers through Google Hangout, email, or by phone.

802
01:22:05,778 --> 01:22:11,762
[SPEAKER_19]: We are asking all staff to share their designated offers with families by the end of this week.

803
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:26,761
[SPEAKER_19]: Guidance councils, adjustment councils, and school psychologists will address students' social-emotional needs, post-secondary educational planning as applicable, and other matters regarding students' mental health as applicable.

804
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:31,065
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a very stressful time, again, not only for students, but for adults.

805
01:22:31,626 --> 01:22:36,070
[SPEAKER_19]: And as much support as we can offer, I think, is appropriate.

806
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,448
[SPEAKER_19]: Collaboration is really important.

807
01:22:40,528 --> 01:22:45,731
[SPEAKER_19]: That was one of the themes in Commissioner Riley's communication.

808
01:22:46,071 --> 01:22:57,258
[SPEAKER_19]: So teachers are encouraged to reach out to their colleagues, their grade level colleagues, their subject level colleagues, or teams to share resources and to plan lessons.

809
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:58,959
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know this has been occurring.

810
01:23:00,612 --> 01:23:09,720
[SPEAKER_19]: Special educators and English learners support teachers where applicable should be collaborating with general education teachers to appropriately modify and support instructional delivery.

811
01:23:10,821 --> 01:23:23,592
[SPEAKER_19]: With regard to Title I teachers, they should be collaborating with general education teachers regarding work in phonics, fluency, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing skills specifically for those students identified as Title I.

812
01:23:25,581 --> 01:23:34,985
[SPEAKER_19]: We are going to ask that staff participate in biweekly online meetings during the first two weeks of this plan.

813
01:23:35,085 --> 01:23:39,226
[SPEAKER_19]: Meetings may need to occur more frequently between administration and staff.

814
01:23:40,127 --> 01:23:43,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Generally, these meetings will take place from 2.30 to 3.15 in the afternoon with a 24-hour notice.

815
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:55,574
[SPEAKER_19]: On the middle and high school level, meetings will alternate between building-based meetings and department-based meetings.

816
01:23:57,335 --> 01:23:59,836
[SPEAKER_19]: We will offer some guidance to administrators on this.

817
01:24:00,897 --> 01:24:08,681
[SPEAKER_19]: It's important to note, staff will not be penalized for not attending meetings on account of sickness or other COVID-19 related emergency.

818
01:24:09,901 --> 01:24:16,805
[SPEAKER_19]: And lastly, paraprofessionals shall be prepared to assist teachers in instructional support for students.

819
01:24:19,126 --> 01:24:23,072
[SPEAKER_19]: So the next section is on English learner education.

820
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:29,061
[SPEAKER_19]: Next section is English learner education.

821
01:24:29,101 --> 01:24:35,150
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me go through this quickly and then I know Paul Texair is here and at the end he can field questions.

822
01:24:36,722 --> 01:24:42,708
[SPEAKER_19]: English learner teachers will follow students established plans, which are determined by the language proficiency level of the students.

823
01:24:43,408 --> 01:24:50,015
[SPEAKER_19]: EL teachers will ensure that EL students have the opportunity to engage in reading, writing, listening, and speaking activities.

824
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:55,183
[SPEAKER_19]: They're appropriate for students' English language development.

825
01:24:56,104 --> 01:25:03,892
[SPEAKER_19]: EL teachers will collaborate with classroom and content teachers where appropriate to support students with grade level and contentarial.

826
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:11,039
[SPEAKER_19]: In-class tutors and bilingual EL aides will support EL and classroom teachers to support English learners.

827
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:14,483
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on to special education.

828
01:25:16,803 --> 01:25:23,068
[SPEAKER_19]: Students and caregivers will be provided with ongoing educational therapeutic resources.

829
01:25:24,629 --> 01:25:32,575
[SPEAKER_19]: Access to curriculum materials, the accommodations and modifications that are required for individual student needs, and ongoing communication and support.

830
01:25:34,236 --> 01:25:41,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Minute-for-minute remote, excuse me, minute-for-minute remote service as dictated by the student's IEP are not expected.

831
01:25:42,022 --> 01:25:44,804
[SPEAKER_19]: Per the Department of Education and USED,

832
01:25:46,184 --> 01:25:47,205
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's U.S.

833
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,145
[SPEAKER_19]: Department of Education.

834
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:48,766
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize.

835
01:25:49,206 --> 01:25:55,770
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not feasible for schools to provide services in the manner they are typically provided pursuant to students' IEPs.

836
01:25:56,270 --> 01:26:08,217
[SPEAKER_19]: Both special education and general education staff are encouraged to participate in special education meetings, and more specific guidance on this matter is expected from the Massachusetts Department of Education in the coming days.

837
01:26:08,977 --> 01:26:17,132
[SPEAKER_19]: I know Joan Bowen has been attending many meetings with the Department of Education, and not everything is firm.

838
01:26:17,192 --> 01:26:18,795
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is an evolving situation.

839
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:27,983
[SPEAKER_19]: In general, with regard to special educators, special education teachers will collaborate with general education teachers to create and modify instruction.

840
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:35,985
[SPEAKER_19]: They will provide support to students via various platforms such as email, Google Classroom, Google Hangouts, and phone conversations.

841
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:47,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Weekly office hours will provide students and parents and caregivers with an opportunity to reach out to staff with questions, concerns, and requests.

842
01:26:51,292 --> 01:26:57,757
[SPEAKER_19]: With regard to paraprofessionals, paraprofessionals may also be called upon to assist in the instructional support of students.

843
01:26:58,597 --> 01:27:05,242
[SPEAKER_19]: I did speak to Gina Coppola, who leads the paraprofessional bargaining unit, and she is in full support of this.

844
01:27:07,183 --> 01:27:18,411
[SPEAKER_19]: With regard to social emotional support, clinical counseling and behavioral staff will reach out to all families and students on their caseloads to check in and to provide counseling and support if needed and requested.

845
01:27:19,011 --> 01:27:24,595
[SPEAKER_19]: They will also coordinate with outside agencies affiliated with families to discuss services and wraparound care.

846
01:27:25,756 --> 01:27:28,558
[SPEAKER_19]: With regard to speech language hearing services,

847
01:27:29,802 --> 01:27:37,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Speech-language pathologists and teachers of the deaf will continue to reach out to their students and families to provide activities, suggestions, and resources.

848
01:27:38,548 --> 01:27:51,157
[SPEAKER_19]: Speech-language pathologists and teachers of the deaf recommendations will focus on supporting communication skills with daily activities in addition to more student-focused speech-language hearing enrichment activities.

849
01:27:54,245 --> 01:28:07,976
[SPEAKER_19]: Please note the use of teletherapy as a mode of service delivery is highly regulated by the Massachusetts State Board of Licensed Speech Language Pathology, in addition to the American Speech Language Hearing Association.

850
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:14,842
[SPEAKER_19]: The district is in the process of acquiring more information from the Department of Ed,

851
01:28:16,313 --> 01:28:19,677
[SPEAKER_19]: and the Massachusetts State Board of Licensure for Speech Language Pathologists.

852
01:28:20,038 --> 01:28:21,760
[SPEAKER_19]: So more information is evolving.

853
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:28,948
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that there have been many questions regarding teletherapy as a delivery source.

854
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:32,493
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on to occupational therapy and physical therapy.

855
01:28:36,498 --> 01:28:42,899
[SPEAKER_19]: Occupational therapists and physical therapists will continue to reach out to their students and their families to provide resources and activities.

856
01:28:43,639 --> 01:29:02,763
[SPEAKER_19]: Their recommendations will focus on establishing and maintaining healthy routines that include, for example, participation in chores and other household tasks, spending time outside, engaging in physical activity, and providing resources for these activities in addition to a more student-focused enrichment experience.

857
01:29:05,729 --> 01:29:17,063
[SPEAKER_19]: Regular communication with students and families is expected, and as noted above, minute-for-minute remote services as dictated by the IEP grid are not expected.

858
01:29:17,823 --> 01:29:24,732
[SPEAKER_19]: Per the Department of Ed and the Federal Department of Ed, it's not feasible for schools to provide services in this manner.

859
01:29:26,284 --> 01:29:34,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on to vision services, the district is in regular communication with the Perkins School for the Blind and community services who provide our district vision services.

860
01:29:35,307 --> 01:29:38,949
[SPEAKER_19]: They are working on a plan to support students and parents.

861
01:29:40,549 --> 01:29:51,974
[SPEAKER_19]: With regard to evaluation team leaders, ETLs will reach out to families of students who attend Metro Public Schools, private and parochial schools, as well as students who are enrolled in our out-of-district placements.

862
01:29:52,334 --> 01:29:55,495
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would include collaborative stay and residential placements.

863
01:29:57,348 --> 01:30:05,671
[SPEAKER_19]: The ETLs will contact parents and caregivers to inquire about how students are adapting and functioning at home, and if any additional support may be needed from the district.

864
01:30:06,772 --> 01:30:26,840
[SPEAKER_19]: And then with regard to Special Education Administration, who have been working busily, as have many of us, they will continue to meet and communicate on a regular basis to discuss updates from the Department of Ed, as well as to communicate questions to provide guidance and support during this time.

865
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:34,150
[SPEAKER_19]: while time along with triaging and problem solving situations that may arise in their respective areas.

866
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:36,992
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so those are the guidelines.

867
01:30:37,173 --> 01:30:40,335
[SPEAKER_19]: And many of the teachers have already been engaging in this.

868
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:45,840
[SPEAKER_19]: So we hear some great, great stories.

869
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Teachers have shared with me what they're doing.

870
01:30:47,961 --> 01:30:49,683
[SPEAKER_19]: So a lot of this is already happening.

871
01:30:50,003 --> 01:30:52,185
[SPEAKER_19]: But now we've established these guidelines.

872
01:30:53,463 --> 01:31:00,766
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to move now on to grading, which has been a question that has come up over and over.

873
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:10,589
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of the teachers that I oversee in the World Language Department have conveyed to me that students have been asking questions about how are they going to be graded.

874
01:31:11,509 --> 01:31:13,570
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know this is pervasive through the district.

875
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:16,832
[SPEAKER_19]: more so primarily on the secondary level.

876
01:31:17,412 --> 01:31:24,958
[SPEAKER_19]: So per the Department of Education guidelines for remote learning plans, students should be graded on a credit, no credit basis.

877
01:31:25,558 --> 01:31:29,741
[SPEAKER_19]: So in Medford, this is going to take the form of a pass, fail.

878
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,101
[SPEAKER_19]: And that applies to all students.

879
01:31:33,801 --> 01:31:42,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Middle and high school students should receive a pass fail grade for each of their classes for work in the third quarter up through March 12th.

880
01:31:43,285 --> 01:31:46,427
[SPEAKER_19]: March 12th was the last day that they were in school.

881
01:31:47,407 --> 01:31:50,109
[SPEAKER_19]: So they are not being graded on their enrichment work.

882
01:31:51,609 --> 01:31:57,052
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're gonna be graded with a pass fail up through their work until March 12th.

883
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:06,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Passing grades for quarter four should be based on students' participation in the learning activities beginning with the commencement of this plan.

884
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:17,018
[SPEAKER_19]: When determining credit or no credit for course grades, teachers in the district will follow the guidelines as outlined in the Department of Ed guidelines dated March 26, 2020.

885
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:22,904
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll read this quote from the Department of Education.

886
01:32:22,944 --> 01:32:24,365
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is really, this is important.

887
01:32:24,385 --> 01:32:28,850
[SPEAKER_19]: This is going to be, this needs to be at the forefront of when we're grading students.

888
01:32:29,451 --> 01:32:48,852
[SPEAKER_19]: Before moving forward with any determination of no credit, we strongly urge districts and schools to consider whether the students have had equitable access to learning opportunities during this closure, keeping in mind the variety of technology, health, disability, and language challenges that could occur.

889
01:32:50,168 --> 01:32:51,788
[SPEAKER_19]: So we really need to be cognizant of this.

890
01:32:52,309 --> 01:32:55,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Administrators have had conversations about this.

891
01:32:55,250 --> 01:33:06,433
[SPEAKER_19]: This is not going to be easy, but we really need to be mindful of some of the difficulties that kids may experience in participating in the work.

892
01:33:08,413 --> 01:33:11,054
[SPEAKER_19]: We offer some guidelines for students and families.

893
01:33:14,615 --> 01:33:18,997
[SPEAKER_19]: Students are expected to engage in the learning activities that their teachers have prepared for them.

894
01:33:19,497 --> 01:33:21,398
[SPEAKER_19]: Our teachers are putting a lot of work into this.

895
01:33:22,198 --> 01:33:31,823
[SPEAKER_19]: And even though it's grading, pass, fail, our expectation is that students are going to engage as best they can, as best their situation allows them to.

896
01:33:33,903 --> 01:33:38,245
[SPEAKER_19]: The following recommendations will help strengthen students' learning experience in the home.

897
01:33:39,306 --> 01:33:41,847
[SPEAKER_19]: So just some suggestions.

898
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:48,422
[SPEAKER_19]: for families to develop a flexible and realistic schedule for the completion of assignments.

899
01:33:48,882 --> 01:33:54,751
[SPEAKER_19]: Most families will likely be juggling multiple duties in addition to monitoring their child's academic progress.

900
01:33:56,485 --> 01:34:02,189
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be helpful for parents to create a dedicated workspace for their child.

901
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:10,015
[SPEAKER_19]: If a parent can help their child with any technical problems that may arise with their online sessions, that would be helpful.

902
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,117
[SPEAKER_19]: If they can support home learning,

903
01:34:13,837 --> 01:34:19,119
[SPEAKER_19]: as much as possible that's helpful, but we are cognizant that that may not always be able to occur.

904
01:34:20,019 --> 01:34:26,241
[SPEAKER_19]: We ask parents and students to check their email often for any communication from their teacher.

905
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:33,903
[SPEAKER_19]: We ask them to be proactive in communicating with teachers, support personnel, and school administrators as needed.

906
01:34:33,963 --> 01:34:38,364
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of the guiding principles is that of communication.

907
01:34:38,664 --> 01:34:40,345
[SPEAKER_19]: So we want those venues to be open.

908
01:34:42,193 --> 01:34:43,294
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's helpful.

909
01:34:43,754 --> 01:34:49,098
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, I struggle with this myself is that I provide students with the structured sleep wake cycle.

910
01:34:49,278 --> 01:34:55,522
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really easy to get out of the cycle is I have learned when my my seven year old is is up at 11 o'clock.

911
01:34:56,683 --> 01:34:56,763
[SPEAKER_19]: Um,

912
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:02,221
[SPEAKER_19]: Next section, we have guidelines for administrators.

913
01:35:02,281 --> 01:35:15,127
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, administrators, we're on call, and we need to, in a reasonable way, we need to provide support to teachers as needed.

914
01:35:16,668 --> 01:35:24,852
[SPEAKER_19]: Administrators are available to parents and caregivers to answer questions, clarify expectations, and to provide any additional support that

915
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:25,926
[SPEAKER_19]: where applicable.

916
01:35:26,627 --> 01:35:35,412
[SPEAKER_19]: The next section of this report provides instruction resources and suggestions to support remote learning.

917
01:35:35,573 --> 01:35:46,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Each one of the academic directors has gone through and in many cases, with the help of their teachers, has compiled lists through a link.

918
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:47,840
[SPEAKER_19]: Each one of these are links.

919
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,823
[SPEAKER_19]: There are a couple that don't appear to be links yet, but they will be by tomorrow.

920
01:35:54,061 --> 01:36:00,383
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, between the time that this meeting began, I did have some directors submit more stuff.

921
01:36:00,403 --> 01:36:01,504
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're ongoing.

922
01:36:01,524 --> 01:36:03,244
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're live links with material.

923
01:36:04,165 --> 01:36:11,287
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've broken them out into Pre-K 2, a section for Pre-K 2, Grades 3 to 5, Grades 6 to 8, Grades 9 to 12.

924
01:36:11,928 --> 01:36:15,889
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are suggested resources for teachers.

925
01:36:16,469 --> 01:36:19,190
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, they are reinforcing what was already taught.

926
01:36:21,874 --> 01:36:23,315
[SPEAKER_19]: which is a change.

927
01:36:23,475 --> 01:36:37,783
[SPEAKER_19]: And for the most part, teachers now realize this if they're watching, many of them probably thought they were gonna continue with material, but they are refining and they're going in depth with the skills and the material that they have already taught.

928
01:36:38,523 --> 01:36:40,524
[SPEAKER_19]: We have some distance learning resources.

929
01:36:40,724 --> 01:36:43,406
[SPEAKER_19]: So we do have a Google Classroom Training Module.

930
01:36:43,426 --> 01:36:47,188
[SPEAKER_19]: So there are several classes within that link, Google Classroom Training.

931
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:52,466
[SPEAKER_19]: There are also some other sites that are available.

932
01:36:53,888 --> 01:36:56,692
[SPEAKER_19]: There are a lot of sites out there, some are better than others.

933
01:36:57,073 --> 01:37:00,077
[SPEAKER_19]: The three that we have provided, we think are pretty good.

934
01:37:00,137 --> 01:37:03,823
[SPEAKER_19]: The first one being, actually all of them, we think are.

935
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,062
[SPEAKER_19]: could be beneficial to teachers.

936
01:37:07,803 --> 01:37:13,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Lastly, with regard to references, I've mentioned the Commissioner's March 26th communication.

937
01:37:14,131 --> 01:37:15,372
[SPEAKER_19]: So that is listed.

938
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:19,978
[SPEAKER_19]: We also reached out to other districts.

939
01:37:21,399 --> 01:37:24,183
[SPEAKER_19]: We looked at in-depthly Lexington's

940
01:37:24,643 --> 01:37:25,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Lexington's plan.

941
01:37:25,664 --> 01:37:28,626
[SPEAKER_19]: We read that the Department of Education.

942
01:37:28,646 --> 01:37:33,548
[SPEAKER_19]: Has made some very positive comments about the Lexington plan.

943
01:37:33,569 --> 01:37:40,913
[SPEAKER_19]: So we did incorporate some of that some of the thoughts or some of the background into Our plan and why we

944
01:37:41,906 --> 01:37:43,127
[SPEAKER_19]: created our plan the way it is.

945
01:37:43,687 --> 01:37:45,468
[SPEAKER_19]: We looked at Newtown, Connecticut.

946
01:37:45,508 --> 01:37:52,671
[SPEAKER_19]: So Newtown, Connecticut was very interesting because if you look at their plan, it was created for the 2019-2020 school year.

947
01:37:52,691 --> 01:37:55,213
[SPEAKER_19]: It was not created specifically for this emergency.

948
01:37:55,993 --> 01:38:05,057
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it was not super extensive, but it was complete and it was thoughtful.

949
01:38:05,418 --> 01:38:09,980
[SPEAKER_19]: So Newtown, Connecticut obviously has had its share of emergencies in the past.

950
01:38:11,488 --> 01:38:15,191
[SPEAKER_19]: Years, so theirs I thought was thoughtful.

951
01:38:16,452 --> 01:38:21,495
[SPEAKER_19]: Burlington, Burlington Public Schools, actually Paul DeLeva called my attention to the Burlington Public Schools.

952
01:38:22,236 --> 01:38:24,458
[SPEAKER_19]: They have a lot of similarities to what we have.

953
01:38:24,978 --> 01:38:30,962
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, we tried to, we did our research, Peter Cushing's survey.

954
01:38:31,983 --> 01:38:34,125
[SPEAKER_19]: We had our outreach to administration.

955
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:41,612
[SPEAKER_19]: The other districts, our federal and state guidance.

956
01:38:42,532 --> 01:38:43,733
[SPEAKER_19]: Is the plan perfect?

957
01:38:43,853 --> 01:38:45,274
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think anything is perfect.

958
01:38:46,255 --> 01:38:48,196
[SPEAKER_19]: We will continue to update this.

959
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:53,999
[SPEAKER_19]: We will continue to ask for feedback to see where it needs to, does it need to be adjusted.

960
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:59,384
[SPEAKER_19]: The Teachers Association was incredibly supportive.

961
01:39:00,004 --> 01:39:05,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Charlene Douglas, who was part of this meeting, was incredibly helpful.

962
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:11,716
[SPEAKER_19]: Charlene and I spent a lot of time this weekend going over lots of different components.

963
01:39:12,156 --> 01:39:15,320
[SPEAKER_19]: I enjoy working with Charlene.

964
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:16,281
[SPEAKER_19]: I've known her for a long time.

965
01:39:16,721 --> 01:39:17,222
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think

966
01:39:18,597 --> 01:39:25,482
[SPEAKER_19]: This was actually really, I'll say, special opportunity, even though it comes at a negative time.

967
01:39:25,902 --> 01:39:29,785
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it was a really nice opportunity for us to work collaboratively on this plan.

968
01:39:30,787 --> 01:39:32,588
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have spoken for a long time.

969
01:39:32,608 --> 01:39:35,509
[SPEAKER_19]: I am happy to answer questions.

970
01:39:35,969 --> 01:39:45,213
[SPEAKER_19]: I think probably any questions that have to do with special education, Joan might be a better person to answer those.

971
01:39:45,573 --> 01:39:46,833
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, Joan.

972
01:39:47,013 --> 01:39:49,414
[SPEAKER_19]: And then E.L., probably Paul Tech Sarah.

973
01:39:49,554 --> 01:39:53,656
[SPEAKER_19]: But I am happy to try to answer questions that you may have.

974
01:39:54,696 --> 01:39:55,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Dr. Riccadeli.

975
01:39:57,152 --> 01:39:57,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

976
01:39:57,352 --> 01:40:00,595
[SPEAKER_18]: Douglas, I want to give you for a couple minutes.

977
01:40:00,655 --> 01:40:02,996
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you worked hard on this for the teachers.

978
01:40:03,437 --> 01:40:04,237
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you both.

979
01:40:04,277 --> 01:40:04,637
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

980
01:40:05,078 --> 01:40:05,438
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

981
01:40:05,978 --> 01:40:19,128
[SPEAKER_27]: So yes, and I can express my thanks enough to Bernadette and the work we did together to look at the totality of this plan and how do we meet the needs of all.

982
01:40:19,482 --> 01:40:21,967
[SPEAKER_27]: the health, the social, emotional, all of those things.

983
01:40:22,368 --> 01:40:24,632
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, these are definitely unprecedented times.

984
01:40:24,652 --> 01:40:28,139
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I am a professor at Lesley University and people know that.

985
01:40:29,025 --> 01:40:32,487
[SPEAKER_27]: Very similar, the grading, pass, fail, biggest colleges in the world.

986
01:40:32,867 --> 01:40:44,953
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, while it's not ideal, we do wanna give, you know, the grades, the feedback, but realistically, we have to look at, you know, who are students, where are they, and are our students actually able to access this?

987
01:40:45,053 --> 01:40:47,174
[SPEAKER_27]: I've discussed this with a number of teachers.

988
01:40:48,555 --> 01:40:54,818
[SPEAKER_27]: I have a Google question doc, which is full with questions and things that I'm constantly referring to on a regular basis.

989
01:40:55,638 --> 01:41:09,204
[SPEAKER_27]: And, you know, I'm talking to teachers, some teachers are meeting, even though they're reaching out, we're still only hearing maybe from 50% sometimes of the students, which is, we hope to increase that and keep on working towards that and what that looks like.

990
01:41:09,758 --> 01:41:18,240
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that there are teachers who have made packets and putting them in envelopes and mailing them out to the students themselves, doing those sorts of things.

991
01:41:19,281 --> 01:41:20,701
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that they're online.

992
01:41:20,761 --> 01:41:23,222
[SPEAKER_27]: I know people are working extremely hard.

993
01:41:23,622 --> 01:41:25,382
[SPEAKER_27]: We did look to DESE guidelines.

994
01:41:25,742 --> 01:41:29,723
[SPEAKER_27]: We did look to that social emotional, that whole piece.

995
01:41:31,024 --> 01:41:35,945
[SPEAKER_27]: At a time like this, some of our most challenging students and challenging families

996
01:41:36,297 --> 01:41:42,062
[SPEAKER_27]: that are home, you know, taking care of, maybe, you know, taking care of a niece, a nephew, or this one.

997
01:41:42,382 --> 01:41:44,944
[SPEAKER_27]: Parents are working, they're working from home, they need the computer.

998
01:41:45,485 --> 01:41:49,428
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I have three sisters, three siblings, we all work on that one computer.

999
01:41:49,728 --> 01:41:50,729
[SPEAKER_27]: How do we accomplish that?

1000
01:41:51,049 --> 01:41:57,534
[SPEAKER_27]: That's why these guidelines were put in place to consider all of those needs of all of our population.

1001
01:41:57,895 --> 01:42:00,577
[SPEAKER_27]: And our teachers, you know, they're home with their families.

1002
01:42:01,137 --> 01:42:04,240
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not, this is not anything that,

1003
01:42:05,681 --> 01:42:06,862
[SPEAKER_27]: we've ever experienced before.

1004
01:42:07,182 --> 01:42:08,043
[SPEAKER_27]: Teachers are sad.

1005
01:42:08,083 --> 01:42:09,364
[SPEAKER_27]: They want to be with their students.

1006
01:42:09,444 --> 01:42:15,689
[SPEAKER_27]: I hear on a regular basis, oh my God, you know, I used to look forward to April vacation, but that was a week we knew we were coming back.

1007
01:42:16,009 --> 01:42:16,950
[SPEAKER_27]: This is not a vacation.

1008
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:23,755
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a period of hardship and, you know, is my student, are my students okay?

1009
01:42:23,835 --> 01:42:25,717
[SPEAKER_27]: There are genuine concerns about that.

1010
01:42:26,793 --> 01:42:31,477
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think that working with Bernadette was tremendous, and I appreciate that.

1011
01:42:31,517 --> 01:42:34,239
[SPEAKER_27]: And I will happily answer any questions regarding this.

1012
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:37,202
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm here for this meeting and anything I can help with.

1013
01:42:37,462 --> 01:42:38,023
[SPEAKER_27]: So thank you.

1014
01:42:38,243 --> 01:42:38,943
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks, Bernadette.

1015
01:42:39,243 --> 01:42:45,008
[SPEAKER_27]: And thank you to all the administrators who I know did a great deal of input, Joan and everyone.

1016
01:42:45,068 --> 01:42:46,509
[SPEAKER_27]: And so I thank you all for that.

1017
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:48,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Charlene.

1018
01:42:48,411 --> 01:42:51,513
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Rousseau, do you have some questions there?

1019
01:42:51,533 --> 01:42:52,454
[SPEAKER_18]: I do.

1020
01:42:52,574 --> 01:42:53,895
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a few questions.

1021
01:42:56,162 --> 01:42:59,425
[SPEAKER_22]: So this question comes from Michael Bernstein.

1022
01:43:00,105 --> 01:43:12,936
[SPEAKER_22]: I will not read the addresses and stuff since I have that in the emails, but there seems, I see in this document that Zoom is not preferred, but it seems that some teachers are under the impression that they're not allowed to use it.

1023
01:43:13,016 --> 01:43:17,019
[SPEAKER_22]: Can we just get clarification that they are allowed to use it if they want?

1024
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:22,163
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, they can allow, they are allowed to use it.

1025
01:43:22,764 --> 01:43:24,145
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not the,

1026
01:43:26,345 --> 01:43:28,066
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not our preferred way.

1027
01:43:28,406 --> 01:43:30,347
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't offered training in it.

1028
01:43:30,547 --> 01:43:32,168
[SPEAKER_19]: We do offer training in Google.

1029
01:43:32,188 --> 01:43:33,329
[SPEAKER_19]: We are a Google district.

1030
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:35,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Teachers can use it.

1031
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:37,151
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1032
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:44,294
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the next questions is actually three questions from Kelly Catalo at 46.

1033
01:43:44,915 --> 01:43:50,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, what grade point average will be reported to colleges for juniors?

1034
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:57,302
[SPEAKER_19]: So Paul DeLeve and I had a long conversation about this.

1035
01:43:58,323 --> 01:44:05,327
[SPEAKER_19]: And our thinking is that a grade point average will not be reported.

1036
01:44:08,031 --> 01:44:09,752
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not going to be unique to Medford.

1037
01:44:10,853 --> 01:44:15,717
[SPEAKER_19]: This is universal across the world.

1038
01:44:15,817 --> 01:44:18,439
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have to delve a little deeper.

1039
01:44:18,599 --> 01:44:22,202
[SPEAKER_19]: How is this going to affect college admissions?

1040
01:44:22,783 --> 01:44:29,848
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to have to put something on the transcript that indicates why this pass-fail grade was given.

1041
01:44:31,170 --> 01:44:37,877
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it's a great question because we have questions ourselves, but we're going to do it in the fairest way we can.

1042
01:44:38,317 --> 01:44:41,060
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't think it is fair to report a grade point average.

1043
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:49,089
[SPEAKER_19]: The grade point average would be calculated for quarters one and two, which is really not representative of their

1044
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:53,732
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, of the work in a course as a whole.

1045
01:44:53,992 --> 01:45:02,778
[SPEAKER_19]: So right now, our thinking, and if Paul DeLeva wants to add to this, our thinking is that it would not, a grade point average would not be reported.

1046
01:45:04,619 --> 01:45:05,020
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1047
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:06,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. DeLeva.

1048
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:06,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. DeLeva.

1049
01:45:07,041 --> 01:45:10,083
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me just unmute you.

1050
01:45:13,085 --> 01:45:13,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1051
01:45:15,547 --> 01:45:16,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for everyone meeting.

1052
01:45:17,588 --> 01:45:19,710
[SPEAKER_01]: In concurrence with Dr. Riccidelli,

1053
01:45:20,366 --> 01:45:26,128
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, I'm gonna be looking for guidance from other high schools as well to see how they're gonna handle this.

1054
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:36,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, our thought process is within the transcripts marking that, you know, due to COVID-19, this is what we have listed down.

1055
01:45:37,732 --> 01:45:43,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're talking about pass fail, we're talking about, you know, final values, things of that nature.

1056
01:45:43,594 --> 01:45:46,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, where we exited

1057
01:45:47,524 --> 01:45:58,987
[SPEAKER_01]: March 12th, you know, to do that calculation, four quarters, different standards, I think coming up with something that we can put on the transcripts is probably a better way to go.

1058
01:45:59,147 --> 01:46:03,089
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to kind of reiterate what Dr. Riccadelli had said.

1059
01:46:03,989 --> 01:46:04,389
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1060
01:46:04,409 --> 01:46:06,070
[SPEAKER_22]: Member Russo.

1061
01:46:06,530 --> 01:46:06,890
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1062
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:13,892
[SPEAKER_22]: The next question is, so Google Classroom is pretty good at communicating with the students, but the parents

1063
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,722
[SPEAKER_22]: have an unusual need to be communicated with.

1064
01:46:17,742 --> 01:46:24,507
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, as a parent of a student with special needs, I'm very accustomed to being part of the communication chain.

1065
01:46:24,868 --> 01:46:33,314
[SPEAKER_22]: But for a lot, my daughter, for instance, we don't really have much communication with the teachers, and that's fine under normal circumstances.

1066
01:46:34,315 --> 01:46:40,280
[SPEAKER_22]: But now parents, I think, for the most part, feel that they need to be part of these communication chains with

1067
01:46:41,116 --> 01:46:43,098
[SPEAKER_22]: no matter where their kids are and what grade levels.

1068
01:46:43,339 --> 01:46:52,069
[SPEAKER_22]: So is there any plan for how we're going to weave parent communication in when it wasn't necessarily part of the methodology in the past?

1069
01:46:59,875 --> 01:47:01,035
[SPEAKER_19]: We did a conversation about this.

1070
01:47:01,196 --> 01:47:18,388
[SPEAKER_19]: My understanding is if the parent is added to that class, then the parent can view the information between the teacher and the student can see the assignments, can communicate with the parent that way if they are made part of the Google Classroom.

1071
01:47:19,543 --> 01:47:22,125
[SPEAKER_19]: So and you bring up a good point.

1072
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:33,115
[SPEAKER_19]: So parents are probably going to need some guidance on that So we can we can definitely get that out to parents To do but the in terms of communication school break.

1073
01:47:33,135 --> 01:47:34,956
[SPEAKER_19]: We have opted not to use school brains.

1074
01:47:35,016 --> 01:47:39,620
[SPEAKER_19]: We had that discussion earlier School brains is

1075
01:47:41,643 --> 01:47:50,265
[SPEAKER_19]: quantitative in nature, we need something that is more feedback-driven and less grade-based.

1076
01:47:50,845 --> 01:47:54,946
[SPEAKER_19]: So the mode of communication, we do want to be through that Google Classroom.

1077
01:47:55,687 --> 01:48:01,748
[SPEAKER_19]: So the key is going to get teachers, excuse me, to get parents signed on to those Google Classrooms.

1078
01:48:02,968 --> 01:48:03,349
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1079
01:48:04,649 --> 01:48:08,590
[SPEAKER_22]: And I will hold my question until other people have had a chance.

1080
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:09,010
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1081
01:48:11,373 --> 01:48:12,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Kretz.

1082
01:48:16,214 --> 01:48:18,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for your report, Dr. Riccardelli.

1083
01:48:18,715 --> 01:48:34,220
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to just mention, I forgot to mention this earlier, I think I just got caught up, but I just wanted to thank everybody, Dr. Edward Vincent, Mayor Longo Kern, all the administrators, the principals, the teachers, the parents, and the volunteers, just everybody for

1084
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:38,301
[SPEAKER_09]: What an amazing job you're all doing to put all this together so quickly.

1085
01:48:39,621 --> 01:48:43,822
[SPEAKER_09]: We at my work, we're struggling with getting everybody remote access.

1086
01:48:43,923 --> 01:48:46,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally this week, everybody has remote access.

1087
01:48:46,223 --> 01:48:49,624
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're all learning to do things differently from home.

1088
01:48:50,084 --> 01:48:51,064
[SPEAKER_09]: It is challenging.

1089
01:48:51,084 --> 01:48:54,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just, everybody deserves a great thank you.

1090
01:48:54,705 --> 01:48:55,366
[SPEAKER_09]: You're all heroes.

1091
01:48:57,046 --> 01:49:06,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to know, I received a question like, are we going to be providing distance learning for the career technical education students?

1092
01:49:06,894 --> 01:49:08,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that in the plans?

1093
01:49:08,316 --> 01:49:13,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's the middle of the year and they would still have three more months left of instruction.

1094
01:49:14,792 --> 01:49:17,053
[SPEAKER_19]: So the answer to that is yes.

1095
01:49:17,874 --> 01:49:32,961
[SPEAKER_19]: So in fact, Chad Fallon, who I think is here, just as the other teachers are providing assignments for their children, the CTE instructors will be doing the same.

1096
01:49:34,482 --> 01:49:43,647
[SPEAKER_19]: It is different, and they're gonna have to be creative with it, but the expectation is yes, they are going to be engaging their students

1097
01:49:44,567 --> 01:49:49,189
[SPEAKER_19]: in work related to their shop.

1098
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:54,472
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if Chad is available, if he's able to expand upon that.

1099
01:49:54,852 --> 01:49:55,232
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, I'm here.

1100
01:49:55,252 --> 01:49:56,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Chad.

1101
01:49:56,633 --> 01:49:57,833
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, everybody.

1102
01:49:57,893 --> 01:49:58,293
[SPEAKER_23]: How are you?

1103
01:49:59,694 --> 01:50:00,094
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you?

1104
01:50:00,174 --> 01:50:00,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

1105
01:50:01,075 --> 01:50:05,196
[SPEAKER_23]: So we are from, I can give you a quick report since I have you all here.

1106
01:50:05,337 --> 01:50:10,999
[SPEAKER_23]: From day one, I just want to start out by saying the teachers in the high school complex have been incredible.

1107
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:12,660
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know Paul would agree with me on that.

1108
01:50:13,431 --> 01:50:16,712
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, right the first day we were out, we already had plans in place.

1109
01:50:16,732 --> 01:50:20,793
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, we all kind of had a distance learning mind shift.

1110
01:50:21,993 --> 01:50:39,817
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously, it's not as easy to provide distance learning instruction to students on a CTE path, but we're using this time to review previously taught material, provide more of a focus on the related theory component of the individual Chapter 74 programs, and really just focus on the power standards that they can focus on during the closure.

1111
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:44,463
[SPEAKER_23]: Our cooperative education program is suspended until further notice.

1112
01:50:45,143 --> 01:50:50,889
[SPEAKER_23]: If students wanted to remain on their respective jobs, we left that up to their families and them to decide.

1113
01:50:52,671 --> 01:51:02,902
[SPEAKER_23]: We created a shared folder for all CTE instructors, which is through Google, which use, you know, it's an extensive bank of resources for them with learning activities.

1114
01:51:02,982 --> 01:51:04,143
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a question and answer.

1115
01:51:05,099 --> 01:51:08,620
[SPEAKER_23]: concern page for them if they want to ask questions of Alice, Beth, or myself.

1116
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:12,261
[SPEAKER_23]: We have emails that go back and forth as a group.

1117
01:51:12,281 --> 01:51:21,583
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're, you know, we're building our curriculum as we go, but for the most part, all of our students are involved in some way.

1118
01:51:22,583 --> 01:51:25,003
[SPEAKER_23]: So for our programs that, hold on one second, buddy.

1119
01:51:25,023 --> 01:51:27,584
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm homeschooling a six-year-old here too.

1120
01:51:27,624 --> 01:51:29,464
[SPEAKER_23]: Hold on, buddy.

1121
01:51:31,345 --> 01:51:31,985
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, awesome.

1122
01:51:32,005 --> 01:51:32,825
[SPEAKER_23]: You bought me a flower.

1123
01:51:32,985 --> 01:51:33,265
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1124
01:51:35,710 --> 01:51:48,056
[SPEAKER_23]: So for programs that are delivering hours for certification for state boards, our cosmetology program applied for distance learning to be applied for the hours for cosmetology.

1125
01:51:48,877 --> 01:51:57,481
[SPEAKER_23]: And the electrician board is going to be meeting next week to see if any of the distance learning hours can be applied towards the electrical program.

1126
01:51:59,102 --> 01:52:05,265
[SPEAKER_23]: So in short, yes, we are working on everything now completely for distance learning.

1127
01:52:06,966 --> 01:52:07,887
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

1128
01:52:08,307 --> 01:52:08,768
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1129
01:52:11,070 --> 01:52:11,931
[SPEAKER_18]: Member van de Kloot.

1130
01:52:12,691 --> 01:52:12,811
Hi.

1131
01:52:13,072 --> 01:52:16,575
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I, too, would like to thank everybody for all of their hard work.

1132
01:52:16,755 --> 01:52:25,143
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that so much time you've put together to put together this information for us.

1133
01:52:25,904 --> 01:52:27,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very much appreciated.

1134
01:52:29,534 --> 01:52:37,216
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in this first two weeks, it's been hard to understand what the consistency across the district is.

1135
01:52:37,776 --> 01:52:48,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some wonderful conversations with very happy parents about the information their students were getting, and so very, very positive feedback.

1136
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:59,241
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I don't know was how consistent that was, and whether there were some students who weren't having as good as opportunities as others.

1137
01:53:00,882 --> 01:53:03,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this obviously now takes this to a different level.

1138
01:53:04,605 --> 01:53:13,453
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my first questions is, is we have lost time, and was there any discussion about what we're gonna do during April vacation had?

1139
01:53:19,578 --> 01:53:20,639
[SPEAKER_02]: No answers, okay.

1140
01:53:20,659 --> 01:53:21,519
[SPEAKER_27]: I can answer that.

1141
01:53:22,792 --> 01:53:32,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everybody's just assuming April vacation is going to be a no work time, or are we going to reflect on the fact that we've just lost two weeks?

1142
01:53:34,103 --> 01:53:35,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Some degrees, how are we going to look at that?

1143
01:53:36,145 --> 01:53:37,166
[SPEAKER_02]: People aren't going anywhere.

1144
01:53:37,186 --> 01:53:38,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids are going to be home.

1145
01:53:40,088 --> 01:53:44,691
[SPEAKER_27]: And so there's been no direction from DESE on that at all at this point.

1146
01:53:45,372 --> 01:53:52,176
[SPEAKER_27]: It is a question I know that has been asked by the MTA and how that is being handled.

1147
01:53:52,476 --> 01:53:56,079
[SPEAKER_27]: But we have had absolutely, Paula, no direction.

1148
01:53:57,299 --> 01:54:16,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that's going to need to be considered and you know personally I would just hope even if the activities didn't continue that week that there would be you know a list of things for kids to do because if they're going to be home at least have them some level of direction.

1149
01:54:16,946 --> 01:54:18,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know I'm

1150
01:54:19,787 --> 01:54:20,987
[SPEAKER_02]: just wondering about that.

1151
01:54:21,047 --> 01:54:29,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do realize that this, you know, it's been a recent now that closed till May 4th, you know, and who knows?

1152
01:54:29,709 --> 01:54:30,249
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.

1153
01:54:30,449 --> 01:54:32,309
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know about the future.

1154
01:54:34,149 --> 01:54:38,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions I had, are teachers coming in to assemble packets of information?

1155
01:54:39,030 --> 01:54:48,792
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that, you know, we don't want it to be all, is anybody coming into our schools or are they just assembling them at home if they're sending out any information?

1156
01:54:49,787 --> 01:54:53,150
[SPEAKER_27]: So I can address the teachers I've spoken to.

1157
01:54:53,551 --> 01:54:55,893
[SPEAKER_27]: So we closed on the 12th.

1158
01:54:55,913 --> 01:55:06,023
[SPEAKER_27]: That Friday, teachers went in and took as many things as they could, assembled packets, things like that, did much of it in that day that we went in that Friday.

1159
01:55:06,667 --> 01:55:13,990
[SPEAKER_27]: After that, some teachers have tried, but now that we can't get in the buildings because of the order, so teachers are not being able to do that.

1160
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:26,456
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that many of the teachers that I've spoken to are actually printing things out at their own home, using their own ink, using everything on their own because they realize the need for doing this.

1161
01:55:27,516 --> 01:55:33,119
[SPEAKER_27]: I even had one teacher who's an OG person, went out and bought stuff and just felt the need to do that.

1162
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:40,240
[SPEAKER_27]: So I don't, you know, getting back into the classrooms, like, for example, we discussed, you know, how do we video?

1163
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:47,602
[SPEAKER_27]: So the teacher said, well, maybe I can video myself doing a lesson using my reading cards and the different things, but those things are at school.

1164
01:55:47,982 --> 01:55:50,022
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, how do I do that if I don't have them?

1165
01:55:50,402 --> 01:55:58,504
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think that's something, you know, we need to look at whether we, if the buildings have been cleaned, and then once we do go back in,

1166
01:55:58,984 --> 01:56:03,006
[SPEAKER_27]: Now we have recontaminated that building and it has to be cleaned again.

1167
01:56:03,246 --> 01:56:07,208
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think we have to be, you know, think about, can we go in?

1168
01:56:07,288 --> 01:56:08,108
[SPEAKER_27]: Can we not go in?

1169
01:56:09,149 --> 01:56:10,049
[SPEAKER_27]: What does that look like?

1170
01:56:10,149 --> 01:56:11,230
[SPEAKER_27]: And that is a struggle.

1171
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:18,333
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, many of us are using our own things at home and just, you know, saying, this is what we signed up, I guess, as a teacher.

1172
01:56:18,753 --> 01:56:19,353
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I- Ms.

1173
01:56:19,373 --> 01:56:19,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Caldwell?

1174
01:56:19,974 --> 01:56:20,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, sorry, I think Ms.

1175
01:56:20,974 --> 01:56:21,334
[SPEAKER_18]: Caldwell,

1176
01:56:23,658 --> 01:56:25,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Diane, did you have something to add?

1177
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:28,022
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to reiterate what Charlene has said.

1178
01:56:28,382 --> 01:56:34,968
[SPEAKER_25]: That Friday, all of our teachers did get their work together as best they can, but it was for a different piece.

1179
01:56:35,008 --> 01:56:36,630
[SPEAKER_25]: We're doing something totally different now.

1180
01:56:37,591 --> 01:56:43,356
[SPEAKER_25]: We have had requests to go into the buildings, but we've told our teachers, unfortunately, that they cannot go in.

1181
01:56:43,376 --> 01:56:47,580
[SPEAKER_25]: And so they're doing the best they can with what they have in their homes.

1182
01:56:49,625 --> 01:57:05,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, another question, if I may, you know- Before you ask that question, may I just, if you don't mind, on that topic, are other districts allowing teachers to go in one more time to grab a few things, make copies, do we know?

1183
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:08,551
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1184
01:57:08,571 --> 01:57:08,611
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1185
01:57:12,663 --> 01:57:15,544
[SPEAKER_02]: We are basically at a stay at home.

1186
01:57:16,245 --> 01:57:31,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't want to jeopardize our teachers in any way, safe words, but I'm asking the question because I don't think, I don't want parents to think that they're necessarily gonna get a packet of information in the mail because I think for many, that's really not real.

1187
01:57:32,112 --> 01:57:33,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I wanted the clarification.

1188
01:57:34,413 --> 01:57:37,975
[SPEAKER_02]: My last sort of topic right now is on guidance.

1189
01:57:39,375 --> 01:57:46,958
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the time period where many of our seniors are receiving, if they haven't already, acceptances.

1190
01:57:47,819 --> 01:57:50,420
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be some kids who are going to need last-minute

1191
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:53,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, I need another recommendation or something.

1192
01:57:54,644 --> 01:58:10,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've just somewhat interested in what guidance is doing and how we're making sure that all of our students, particularly our seniors, are receiving the help that they need during this critical period.

1193
01:58:11,988 --> 01:58:14,449
[SPEAKER_19]: So I can try to answer that for you.

1194
01:58:14,469 --> 01:58:18,170
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have been in touch with Maureen Lavin, who's the interim director of guidance.

1195
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:24,011
[SPEAKER_19]: So the role of the guidance counselors at the high school is scheduling.

1196
01:58:24,031 --> 01:58:29,693
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're involved in scheduling for next year and in the post-secondary planning process.

1197
01:58:29,713 --> 01:58:32,474
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are their primary areas that they're working on.

1198
01:58:32,974 --> 01:58:36,455
[SPEAKER_19]: So we know that kids are getting their acceptance letters.

1199
01:58:36,535 --> 01:58:37,115
[SPEAKER_19]: We know that

1200
01:58:38,641 --> 01:58:40,402
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a stressful time for that.

1201
01:58:40,782 --> 01:58:42,584
[SPEAKER_19]: So the guidance counselors are there.

1202
01:58:42,664 --> 01:58:49,908
[SPEAKER_19]: That is between the scheduling for next year and the post-secondary planning.

1203
01:58:50,108 --> 01:58:51,289
[SPEAKER_19]: That is what they're doing.

1204
01:58:51,469 --> 01:58:53,290
[SPEAKER_19]: That is their primary focus.

1205
01:58:53,851 --> 01:58:54,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. D'Avila?

1206
01:58:55,912 --> 01:59:02,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I had a meeting with the guidance counselors this morning in particular, and we did focus a lot on scheduling.

1207
01:59:03,176 --> 01:59:05,358
[SPEAKER_01]: The upside of having, we have Naviance,

1208
01:59:06,184 --> 01:59:13,547
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the stuff that we can do is remotely done that can be transferred from what we currently have in School Brains.

1209
01:59:14,307 --> 01:59:18,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's kind of weird because we're going pass fail on some things as we discussed before.

1210
01:59:18,609 --> 01:59:25,452
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have the means to do things remotely for students, not requiring anybody to go into the building for that.

1211
01:59:25,672 --> 01:59:32,075
[SPEAKER_01]: But as Dr. Riccobelli said, our focus of that conversation now goes into next year for scheduling as well.

1212
01:59:32,595 --> 01:59:35,196
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to do whatever we can for our seniors that need

1213
01:59:35,853 --> 01:59:36,553
[SPEAKER_01]: what they need.

1214
01:59:36,633 --> 01:59:44,735
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, I got to figure out, you know, the eighth graders coming to ninth grade and moving everybody across as well for their schedules.

1215
01:59:45,575 --> 01:59:54,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Any idea about applications for the scholarships, the end of year scholarships, which usually are coming in around beginning now?

1216
01:59:55,418 --> 01:59:55,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1217
01:59:55,738 --> 02:00:00,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we're going to, when we do our plan, we're going to do more of a meet.

1218
02:00:01,482 --> 02:00:03,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's something that's been brought up.

1219
02:00:03,363 --> 02:00:09,168
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just trying to tackle things one at a time to make sure that, um, everything's officially getting done.

1220
02:00:09,208 --> 02:00:11,009
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will also make a note of that.

1221
02:00:11,769 --> 02:00:14,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this may include to make sure that I bring that up at our next meeting.

1222
02:00:14,992 --> 02:00:15,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1223
02:00:17,453 --> 02:00:17,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

1224
02:00:21,845 --> 02:00:27,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, a couple of questions for Bernadette, I guess.

1225
02:00:28,388 --> 02:00:33,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we've done one deployment of Chromebooks already, and it sounds like we gave out like 400 or so Chromebooks.

1226
02:00:36,171 --> 02:00:44,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that there are families out there who felt like it's only going to be a couple of weeks at this point, and I'm sort of making do.

1227
02:00:45,517 --> 02:01:03,263
[SPEAKER_04]: But with a longer projected outlook of all of this through at least May 4th, but in reality could well be past that, do we have a guidance for families who may not yet have computers that would be helpful to share?

1228
02:01:03,984 --> 02:01:06,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, do we have enough Chromebooks?

1229
02:01:07,785 --> 02:01:09,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we don't, are there

1230
02:01:11,343 --> 02:01:20,810
[SPEAKER_04]: funds coming from the state level or elsewhere to support the purchase of additional equipment to support our students.

1231
02:01:21,950 --> 02:01:23,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I can even speak in my own house.

1232
02:01:23,932 --> 02:01:33,278
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a computer, but juggling that between multiple kids, my work computer is not an option.

1233
02:01:33,318 --> 02:01:36,500
[SPEAKER_04]: My husband's work computer is not an option, but at the same time,

1234
02:01:37,709 --> 02:01:40,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we're not alone and I've only got two children.

1235
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:44,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure there's lots of people out there juggling even further than that.

1236
02:01:44,291 --> 02:01:53,454
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you share some guidance and whether there's been any discussion about additional equipment purchases at the city level or even the state level?

1237
02:01:54,655 --> 02:01:58,756
[SPEAKER_19]: So my understanding is we still do have Chromebooks available.

1238
02:01:58,836 --> 02:02:01,517
[SPEAKER_19]: And in fact, my discussion with the

1239
02:02:02,895 --> 02:02:11,344
[SPEAKER_19]: Nina Coppola, who leads the paraprofessional group, is that it is quite possible that we need to get some out to the paraprofessionals as well, as they will be supporting students.

1240
02:02:11,924 --> 02:02:20,853
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are, I'm not sure if Molly Layden, Molly Layden oversees the department and a majority of the technology that is purchased.

1241
02:02:20,914 --> 02:02:22,916
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if she's part of this meeting.

1242
02:02:24,932 --> 02:02:32,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe, maybe not, but I don't know if there are additional funds available to purchase.

1243
02:02:32,334 --> 02:02:34,395
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure what the supply is right now.

1244
02:02:35,535 --> 02:02:36,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Diane, do you know?

1245
02:02:37,116 --> 02:02:42,458
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have a lot of Chromebooks because we've been getting Chromebook cards in the past year or so.

1246
02:02:42,518 --> 02:02:43,938
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're lucky in that respect.

1247
02:02:44,618 --> 02:02:50,320
[SPEAKER_25]: I know earlier, excuse me, earlier today I checked with Molly and we were at

1248
02:02:50,841 --> 02:02:55,862
[SPEAKER_25]: at least 144 additional Chromebooks that will be going out on April 1st.

1249
02:02:56,982 --> 02:03:01,243
[SPEAKER_25]: But we do have a lot of kids and families that will just show up on that day.

1250
02:03:01,263 --> 02:03:09,185
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think we're in good shape with distribution of Chromebooks, not to say that we could always use some more just in case.

1251
02:03:13,406 --> 02:03:13,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1252
02:03:15,925 --> 02:03:23,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And has there been any discussion about the city or the state providing additional equipment should we need it?

1253
02:03:25,808 --> 02:03:27,709
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't heard anything from the state.

1254
02:03:28,549 --> 02:03:30,430
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if anybody's heard anything from DESE.

1255
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:36,443
[SPEAKER_21]: There's been no conversation from Desi around that.

1256
02:03:37,404 --> 02:03:48,674
[SPEAKER_21]: And to procure Chromebooks in a normal situation, you're looking at about a four to six week procurement just through the normal supply chain.

1257
02:03:49,334 --> 02:03:55,400
[SPEAKER_21]: And then once those Chromebooks come in, there's actually an individual licensing of each individual Chromebook.

1258
02:03:55,940 --> 02:04:04,242
[SPEAKER_21]: So just the man hour, I can't even put a number to that of the man hours of literally just provisioning each Chromebook with a license.

1259
02:04:05,622 --> 02:04:09,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Generally speaking, that's done over a summer or with some sort of lead time.

1260
02:04:12,604 --> 02:04:18,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think the important point, though, is we're well off the mark of being a one-to-one Chromebook district.

1261
02:04:18,605 --> 02:04:20,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like

1262
02:04:21,355 --> 02:04:23,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I would not be surprised at all if we run out.

1263
02:04:23,756 --> 02:04:25,477
[SPEAKER_04]: We're nowhere near a one-to-one district.

1264
02:04:25,577 --> 02:04:45,226
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we move forward into prolonged at-home instruction, I think we just, you know, it's more note to, you know, the city and the state level that this is where I sort of expect we're gonna get to a problem here in short order.

1265
02:04:48,588 --> 02:04:49,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one more question.

1266
02:04:52,014 --> 02:04:56,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that we've clarified the Zoom component.

1267
02:04:57,778 --> 02:05:12,650
[SPEAKER_04]: As we go forward with this plan, which by the way, I know was just a tremendous amount of work to put together and start moving everybody down this sort of course corrected path, which is, it feels like what we're all doing every day, almost.

1268
02:05:13,951 --> 02:05:21,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Will there be another iteration of coordination across the district so that our teachers are planning across

1269
02:05:22,395 --> 02:05:26,896
[SPEAKER_04]: not just what's happening in their own building with their grade, but what's happening across the city.

1270
02:05:27,056 --> 02:05:37,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just am super sensitive to the fact that a teacher may have had a really great curriculum plan, lesson plan, and it's all been tossed up in the air.

1271
02:05:37,918 --> 02:05:42,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're saying, how do I give at-home instruction for three hours a day?

1272
02:05:42,698 --> 02:05:45,759
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I do that in a way that doesn't necessarily rely on the computer?

1273
02:05:45,839 --> 02:05:47,079
[SPEAKER_04]: When do I use the computer?

1274
02:05:47,499 --> 02:05:51,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we're totally sort of starting from scratch.

1275
02:05:51,957 --> 02:06:06,643
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am just wondering if there's work that will start to happen across, say like our third grade team, so that our third grade team across the entire city is collaborating and sharing what's been working, what hasn't worked, et cetera.

1276
02:06:07,023 --> 02:06:17,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So that at the end of all of this, our third graders sort of emerge similarly, if that's even possible at this point.

1277
02:06:18,421 --> 02:06:30,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Will that start to happen next or what is the plan as we sort of look forward to how do we on ramp to normal school sometime in the future?

1278
02:06:33,346 --> 02:06:34,487
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me try to answer that.

1279
02:06:34,567 --> 02:06:37,528
[SPEAKER_19]: So we embedded meeting time.

1280
02:06:38,772 --> 02:06:39,714
[SPEAKER_19]: into the plan.

1281
02:06:39,794 --> 02:06:48,509
[SPEAKER_19]: So for the first two weeks of this plan, with 24 hours notice, the administrators can ask teachers to participate in a meeting.

1282
02:06:50,315 --> 02:06:53,758
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're hoping that that is helpful.

1283
02:06:53,798 --> 02:06:56,800
[SPEAKER_19]: So some of those meetings are going to be school-based.

1284
02:06:56,981 --> 02:06:58,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of the meetings are going to be department-based.

1285
02:06:59,202 --> 02:07:02,405
[SPEAKER_19]: When a meeting is department-based, it's a broader group.

1286
02:07:02,525 --> 02:07:04,046
[SPEAKER_19]: It focuses in on the subject.

1287
02:07:04,587 --> 02:07:16,977
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the challenges that we've had, not during this difficult time, but it is difficult to schedule – so, for example, the director of humanities to schedule a meeting with all third-grade teachers.

1288
02:07:17,917 --> 02:07:23,579
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so in normal times, it's difficult to do that with the limited number of time.

1289
02:07:23,959 --> 02:07:26,400
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't mean that we can't do that.

1290
02:07:26,901 --> 02:07:32,963
[SPEAKER_19]: What we can do is we can encourage that to prompt that to occur.

1291
02:07:33,543 --> 02:07:37,845
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess what we're up against is we don't know how much time this is going to last.

1292
02:07:37,965 --> 02:07:39,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it going to last until May 4th?

1293
02:07:40,206 --> 02:07:41,726
[SPEAKER_19]: Does it go to the end of the year?

1294
02:07:42,307 --> 02:07:45,148
[SPEAKER_19]: So in putting this plan together,

1295
02:07:46,333 --> 02:07:53,017
[SPEAKER_19]: With that unknown, I guess the worst case scenario is we're looking between now and June.

1296
02:07:53,177 --> 02:07:55,258
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not that we're looking for a year.

1297
02:07:55,699 --> 02:08:00,782
[SPEAKER_19]: We're looking for what we think is a relatively finite period of time, which is a good thing.

1298
02:08:01,918 --> 02:08:06,403
[SPEAKER_19]: We are going to continue to review what we're doing and to get input.

1299
02:08:06,803 --> 02:08:08,846
[SPEAKER_19]: So it may be very helpful to do that.

1300
02:08:09,186 --> 02:08:13,991
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, we're talking April, May, and then part of June, potentially.

1301
02:08:14,111 --> 02:08:16,053
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't know if we're going until June.

1302
02:08:16,073 --> 02:08:20,337
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is one of the challenges.

1303
02:08:20,598 --> 02:08:22,300
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think your question,

1304
02:08:24,032 --> 02:08:36,264
[SPEAKER_19]: know, points us into a direction that we do need to think about is students at the Brooks getting similar experiences in their distance learning to students at the McGlynn.

1305
02:08:36,684 --> 02:08:39,927
[SPEAKER_19]: So it is, it's our charge and our responsibility to

1306
02:08:41,588 --> 02:08:45,009
[SPEAKER_19]: cross-reference that information to make sure that it is similar.

1307
02:08:45,469 --> 02:08:51,210
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think staff appreciate being able to get together with other, and to share.

1308
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:59,972
[SPEAKER_19]: So I know within the World Language Department that I've been overseeing, we've met a couple of times and it's been great to just to share the information.

1309
02:09:00,812 --> 02:09:09,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Relatively unstrained or sharing type, we probably can schedule those relatively easily.

1310
02:09:11,119 --> 02:09:18,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I Bernadette, I totally appreciate that we can't do everything all at once at the same time.

1311
02:09:19,006 --> 02:09:21,949
[SPEAKER_04]: And that this plan is going to have to live and breathe and change.

1312
02:09:22,029 --> 02:09:26,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we sort of press forward.

1313
02:09:26,133 --> 02:09:34,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sensitive to the fact that our teachers are in uncharted waters as well.

1314
02:09:35,341 --> 02:09:36,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have kids at home and

1315
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:41,562
[SPEAKER_04]: reinventing the wheel for three hours of instruction every single day.

1316
02:09:42,862 --> 02:09:53,767
[SPEAKER_04]: However we can help them make that process easier in the next iteration as this thing evolves, I think would be wonderful for everyone.

1317
02:09:55,567 --> 02:09:55,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1318
02:09:55,967 --> 02:09:57,428
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin.

1319
02:10:00,809 --> 02:10:01,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1320
02:10:02,450 --> 02:10:06,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to echo everyone's sentiment, obviously, on all the hard work that's been done, especially in such a short,

1321
02:10:08,083 --> 02:10:19,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm out of time and also echo member Graham's sentiment about this being a living, breathing document and, you know, it evolving as we are all evolving in this process.

1322
02:10:20,592 --> 02:10:37,503
[SPEAKER_08]: So to that end, I wanna, you know, mention that the items that I bring up today, I don't bring up to, you know, show signs of omissions or anything to this report, but more that we're thinking about this as a community and we're thinking about how some of these questions are being answered

1323
02:10:37,988 --> 02:10:41,912
[SPEAKER_08]: as a community as we move forward, because there are so many.

1324
02:10:42,012 --> 02:10:51,082
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have had the opportunity to talk with some of our directors and our staff, and I think it can all feel a little bit overwhelming.

1325
02:10:51,202 --> 02:10:53,544
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I wanted to mention is,

1326
02:10:54,877 --> 02:11:03,461
[SPEAKER_08]: The Special Education Parent Advisory Council, in addition to Dr. Cushing's survey link, has also sent out a survey link as of Saturday.

1327
02:11:03,521 --> 02:11:08,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it was sent out today's Monday, just for all of those who are still wondering what day it is.

1328
02:11:09,223 --> 02:11:11,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'm in that boat most times.

1329
02:11:11,784 --> 02:11:13,345
[SPEAKER_08]: But we did send out a survey on Saturday.

1330
02:11:13,405 --> 02:11:18,627
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already gotten 88 responses in the special education community, so that's been good to see.

1331
02:11:19,947 --> 02:11:22,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious about the data collection from Dr. Cushing's

1332
02:11:23,956 --> 02:11:26,039
[SPEAKER_08]: whether or not there's a staff survey that's happening.

1333
02:11:26,479 --> 02:11:29,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I think now is a really good time to be getting data collection.

1334
02:11:29,483 --> 02:11:34,350
[SPEAKER_08]: People are really in a position where they can offer feedback and offer ideas.

1335
02:11:34,530 --> 02:11:38,916
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we should be soliciting them from the community as we're working.

1336
02:11:39,617 --> 02:11:42,358
[SPEAKER_08]: to move forward and engage as many stakeholders as we can.

1337
02:11:42,378 --> 02:11:47,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that you are all educators and you know the value of data and the collection of data.

1338
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:53,241
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really highly recommend doing surveys specific to certain populations.

1339
02:11:53,421 --> 02:12:01,984
[SPEAKER_08]: So potentially an EL survey, a staff survey, where the special ed community is doing a survey and looking at that data.

1340
02:12:02,144 --> 02:12:05,064
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just something I wanted to put out there.

1341
02:12:05,264 --> 02:12:06,845
[SPEAKER_08]: And to member Graham's point,

1342
02:12:08,442 --> 02:12:14,084
[SPEAKER_08]: about how are we systemizing or thinking about how this is gonna work in the future.

1343
02:12:14,204 --> 02:12:22,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully this is not gonna happen again anytime soon, but I think we've all realized that this can happen now.

1344
02:12:22,507 --> 02:12:24,928
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we need to have these plans in place.

1345
02:12:24,968 --> 02:12:35,732
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as we're doing them, as we're working now, how are we systemizing for the future so that we're making sure that this is something that we're covered for or thinking about these safety precautions.

1346
02:12:37,208 --> 02:12:52,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Joan Bowen and I have been part of a universal safety committee within the district for the past two years, and we were actually having an event this month, well, the end of April 28th, we had scheduled a big event to talk about what do you do in these circumstances and how do we think about systemizing things.

1347
02:12:53,032 --> 02:13:02,754
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was really timely to have this event, and we've had Stacey Shulman and Jen Hollenbeck and Paul DeLeva and families and a number of people on that universal safety committee

1348
02:13:03,256 --> 02:13:06,317
[SPEAKER_08]: that's done a lot of great work and want to continue to do that work.

1349
02:13:06,437 --> 02:13:09,578
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we should be thinking about how are we systemizing this as a whole.

1350
02:13:10,198 --> 02:13:21,622
[SPEAKER_08]: To Member Graham's point around the Google folders and to Chad Fallon's point around the CTE, grade-level Google folders with shared materials seem like a pretty low-hanging fruit.

1351
02:13:22,642 --> 02:13:26,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Charlene, in terms of the union, what that means.

1352
02:13:26,423 --> 02:13:32,205
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'd like to sort of, again, put it out as a suggestion where people can populate a Google folder

1353
02:13:32,712 --> 02:13:39,316
[SPEAKER_08]: with shared material at grade level so that folks are feeling supported and having some mentor opportunities.

1354
02:13:39,556 --> 02:13:52,324
[SPEAKER_08]: So for questions that I have, Joan, I know that some of these are difficult questions, so I'm not putting you on the spot, but I am putting them out there because they're questions that the community has been asking for special education specifically.

1355
02:13:52,444 --> 02:14:00,549
[SPEAKER_08]: For those who don't know, I am the parent of three children, two of whom have special, all of our children are general education students, of course,

1356
02:14:01,534 --> 02:14:04,656
[SPEAKER_08]: children who are receiving special education supports and services.

1357
02:14:06,117 --> 02:14:16,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two children receiving special education supports and services and so very involved in that community and have been able to ask or receive a lot of questions from families.

1358
02:14:16,222 --> 02:14:18,723
[SPEAKER_08]: So Desi didn't give much guidance.

1359
02:14:18,803 --> 02:14:22,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on a call last week on Thursday around IEP timelines.

1360
02:14:23,317 --> 02:14:23,817
[SPEAKER_08]: How are we?

1361
02:14:23,857 --> 02:14:30,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Joan, I'm just going to do a little list and maybe you can address what you can in this quick list for families that are out there.

1362
02:14:30,841 --> 02:14:31,241
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1363
02:14:31,441 --> 02:14:33,622
[SPEAKER_18]: If I may, we have that as an agenda item.

1364
02:14:33,682 --> 02:14:35,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want to do you want to ask now?

1365
02:14:35,623 --> 02:14:37,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Or do you want to?

1366
02:14:37,564 --> 02:14:38,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we'll wait.

1367
02:14:38,765 --> 02:14:39,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1368
02:14:39,646 --> 02:14:41,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's you can move to you guys.

1369
02:14:42,627 --> 02:14:44,148
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys want to take it out of order, it's up.

1370
02:14:45,753 --> 02:14:50,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's next when we revert back to the regular order business.

1371
02:14:50,717 --> 02:14:54,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go back and then ask the general, I guess, question specifically.

1372
02:14:54,299 --> 02:15:01,704
[SPEAKER_08]: And getting to Bernadette and Charlene's point, how are teachers and families being trained for remote learning?

1373
02:15:01,784 --> 02:15:03,826
[SPEAKER_08]: So I saw that there was the webinar thing.

1374
02:15:04,686 --> 02:15:08,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it accessible for families to be able to access that remote learning webinar?

1375
02:15:08,829 --> 02:15:09,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there are a lot of

1376
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:16,826
[SPEAKER_08]: families out there and teachers and staff who don't necessarily know some of the learning, is that available for all?

1377
02:15:17,226 --> 02:15:19,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And if so, how can they access it?

1378
02:15:19,949 --> 02:15:21,510
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one question regarding general ed.

1379
02:15:21,871 --> 02:15:29,298
[SPEAKER_08]: So remote learning for training, professional development or training for families and staff for remote learning.

1380
02:15:29,678 --> 02:15:32,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there's the webinar link that you guys shared in the report.

1381
02:15:32,721 --> 02:15:34,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it accessible for everybody?

1382
02:15:35,492 --> 02:15:38,815
[SPEAKER_19]: That is an open link that is accessible.

1383
02:15:39,235 --> 02:15:45,901
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we can do is we can get that sent out to parent emails.

1384
02:15:45,921 --> 02:15:47,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1385
02:15:48,002 --> 02:15:49,284
[SPEAKER_19]: To parent email accounts.

1386
02:15:49,364 --> 02:15:50,905
[SPEAKER_19]: So yes, that is accessible.

1387
02:15:51,405 --> 02:15:53,167
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, there's a link on the document.

1388
02:15:53,187 --> 02:15:58,771
[SPEAKER_19]: So when the document goes live, people can just click on it and go right there.

1389
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:03,816
[SPEAKER_19]: But we will send out a communication in some way so that people

1390
02:16:05,242 --> 02:16:10,764
[SPEAKER_19]: even if they don't access the website, they can go, they'll get it in an email and they'll know how to access the training.

1391
02:16:11,485 --> 02:16:12,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Riccadeli.

1392
02:16:13,005 --> 02:16:19,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they don't, or if a teacher or a family member needs support in that training, what would you advise?

1393
02:16:20,609 --> 02:16:29,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if they say there's a technical issue, I know that this happened with some teachers remotely, should they call Molly's department or?

1394
02:16:30,378 --> 02:16:39,505
[SPEAKER_19]: So Molly and I have been in communication, and I know that Molly does have, there are some people within her department that are well-versed in it.

1395
02:16:39,926 --> 02:16:42,828
[SPEAKER_19]: Molly, I don't know if you wanna add anything to that.

1396
02:16:42,928 --> 02:16:52,215
[SPEAKER_19]: We did talk a little bit about that this weekend, about having people there to support if needed.

1397
02:16:55,498 --> 02:16:58,020
[SPEAKER_19]: So Molly, I don't know if you can offer any more information on that.

1398
02:17:00,542 --> 02:17:00,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Molly.

1399
02:17:05,209 --> 02:17:06,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion here.

1400
02:17:06,850 --> 02:17:12,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear us, Molly?

1401
02:17:13,075 --> 02:17:22,183
[SPEAKER_19]: So Molly and I have been in communication, and I know that Molly does have, there are some people within her department that are well-versed in it.

1402
02:17:22,603 --> 02:17:25,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Molly, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.

1403
02:17:25,626 --> 02:17:34,794
[SPEAKER_19]: We did talk a little bit about that this weekend, about having people there to support if needed.

1404
02:17:37,211 --> 02:17:42,534
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I can answer a few questions.

1405
02:17:42,594 --> 02:17:45,435
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually was watching, I just wasn't on before, I'm sorry.

1406
02:17:45,515 --> 02:17:49,597
[SPEAKER_13]: So, in terms of, I just want to answer the first question about the Chromebook number.

1407
02:17:49,617 --> 02:17:50,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear us, Molly?

1408
02:17:50,677 --> 02:17:51,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me?

1409
02:17:51,358 --> 02:17:55,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, jeez, I don't know what's going on here.

1410
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:58,161
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to mute if you're watching it on TV.

1411
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:22,168
[SPEAKER_16]: at this weekend about having people there to support if needed.

1412
02:18:22,468 --> 02:18:25,210
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can answer a few questions.

1413
02:18:25,290 --> 02:18:26,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually was watching.

1414
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:27,511
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wasn't on before.

1415
02:18:27,571 --> 02:18:28,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1416
02:18:28,191 --> 02:18:33,855
[SPEAKER_13]: So in terms of answering the first question about the Chromebook number.

1417
02:18:35,035 --> 02:18:36,896
[SPEAKER_18]: If everybody could mute their microphones.

1418
02:18:40,096 --> 02:18:41,337
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, okay, hold on.

1419
02:18:41,598 --> 02:18:42,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody, let's go.

1420
02:18:43,059 --> 02:18:43,419
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

1421
02:18:44,079 --> 02:18:45,561
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I just remuted everybody.

1422
02:18:45,601 --> 02:18:46,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody must be watching.

1423
02:18:46,841 --> 02:18:51,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead, Molly, sorry.

1424
02:18:52,486 --> 02:18:54,087
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it might be Molly.

1425
02:18:55,488 --> 02:18:56,589
[SPEAKER_17]: Might have to turn off the TV.

1426
02:19:09,201 --> 02:19:10,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Is anybody watching the TV?

1427
02:19:10,502 --> 02:19:12,122
[SPEAKER_18]: If you could just shut it off in the background.

1428
02:19:12,442 --> 02:19:13,683
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody seems to be muted.

1429
02:19:13,703 --> 02:19:16,103
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't, Zach, what do you think?

1430
02:19:16,143 --> 02:19:16,703
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1431
02:19:17,784 --> 02:19:20,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody seems- I think Molly might have the TV on at home.

1432
02:19:21,005 --> 02:19:22,145
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that might be the issue.

1433
02:19:22,165 --> 02:19:28,507
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and the TV and the other, the medfortv.org are both delayed.

1434
02:19:29,267 --> 02:19:31,948
[SPEAKER_22]: So it doesn't work to watch those.

1435
02:19:32,268 --> 02:19:34,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so we're gonna leave, maybe Molly can respond.

1436
02:19:35,409 --> 02:19:36,689
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's not gonna work then.

1437
02:19:40,058 --> 02:19:43,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Dr. Riccardelli, you kind of answered that, so.

1438
02:19:50,980 --> 02:19:52,080
[SPEAKER_18]: Molly, it's not working.

1439
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:53,260
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

1440
02:19:53,280 --> 02:20:07,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin, we can maybe get Molly to respond to the superintendent, and she can forward it all to all of us, and we can get that out to the public.

1441
02:20:08,451 --> 02:20:12,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, I appreciate it.

1442
02:20:12,153 --> 02:20:16,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I had another general question to Ms.

1443
02:20:16,336 --> 02:20:19,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Douglas' point around printing materials.

1444
02:20:19,358 --> 02:20:30,625
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, there was some discussion around, you know, you don't have to have everything be online, educational opportunities, you know, accessible, you know, all those things.

1445
02:20:30,706 --> 02:20:35,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it does beg the question, who is paying for and how are they paying for

1446
02:20:36,730 --> 02:20:37,791
[SPEAKER_08]: printed material?

1447
02:20:39,252 --> 02:20:41,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Are people able to get reimbursed for it?

1448
02:20:41,513 --> 02:20:43,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and it's sort of even like, where are they printing it?

1449
02:20:43,594 --> 02:20:54,220
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not probably too many staples open with this, you know, necessary order only in place.

1450
02:20:54,260 --> 02:20:56,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know what the answer to that is.

1451
02:20:56,221 --> 02:20:58,662
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess I'm just asking the question as we're moving forward.

1452
02:20:59,203 --> 02:21:03,385
[SPEAKER_08]: How are we thinking about reimbursing or paying for printed material?

1453
02:21:04,399 --> 02:21:06,620
[SPEAKER_08]: because that obviously gets really costly.

1454
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:09,281
[SPEAKER_08]: So those were my general questions.

1455
02:21:09,381 --> 02:21:13,442
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we move on to the next agenda item, I'll ask the others.

1456
02:21:13,642 --> 02:21:16,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I have others, but I don't want to take up everyone's time.

1457
02:21:16,963 --> 02:21:19,203
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll wait until the next section.

1458
02:21:21,564 --> 02:21:31,047
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, just adding to the, finally, just adding to the, I guess, bigger question, how are we paying for printed material when teachers have to print or others have to print?

1459
02:21:33,070 --> 02:21:33,390
[SPEAKER_18]: Doctor?

1460
02:21:34,111 --> 02:21:43,936
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I would say, I mean, from the many of the teachers that I've spoken to, they are, they're not providing print material.

1461
02:21:44,176 --> 02:21:46,057
[SPEAKER_19]: They are, so for example, we say,

1462
02:21:49,199 --> 02:21:51,301
[SPEAKER_19]: people don't have to use screen time.

1463
02:21:51,541 --> 02:21:59,408
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm thinking of screen time as like live time, but maybe that's not a solid way to think about it.

1464
02:21:59,788 --> 02:22:07,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Many teachers are creating assignments on Google Sheets and the students are doing it, so maybe they are doing it online.

1465
02:22:08,196 --> 02:22:10,578
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what, I probably shouldn't even try to answer this question.

1466
02:22:11,238 --> 02:22:12,760
[SPEAKER_19]: I need to think about it a little bit more.

1467
02:22:14,153 --> 02:22:16,914
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know many people who are creating packets.

1468
02:22:17,094 --> 02:22:19,055
[SPEAKER_19]: I could be wrong.

1469
02:22:19,976 --> 02:22:26,638
[SPEAKER_19]: There are assignments where it's a reading assignment that doesn't require necessarily anything printed.

1470
02:22:27,119 --> 02:22:40,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, Dr. Riccobelli, as we're talking about, and again, maybe this is blending over a little bit into the next area, but I think as we're talking about accessibility and thinking about printed material, because accessibility is going to be an issue,

1471
02:22:43,354 --> 02:22:48,477
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, not everyone's gonna be able to go online, not everyone's, not every student is able to go online.

1472
02:22:49,277 --> 02:22:57,041
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, again, these are things that I'm just sort of putting out there for us to be asking those questions as we're moving forward.

1473
02:22:58,001 --> 02:23:05,785
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so I'm just thinking reaching out to staff to find out what, you know, how often and are you using print material?

1474
02:23:06,185 --> 02:23:08,686
[SPEAKER_19]: That would probably be a good place to start.

1475
02:23:09,427 --> 02:23:11,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that might be a great question for a staff survey.

1476
02:23:13,496 --> 02:23:13,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1477
02:23:13,876 --> 02:23:14,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that sounds good.

1478
02:23:14,597 --> 02:23:15,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1479
02:23:15,757 --> 02:23:21,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Before we have Joan Bowen present, I just have one quick question for you, Doctor.

1480
02:23:22,401 --> 02:23:29,365
[SPEAKER_18]: You mentioned the clinical counseling, that they would be touching base to their caseload.

1481
02:23:29,405 --> 02:23:40,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, what if we have a student that isn't on the caseload, that is having a hard time dealing with what we're going through, and maybe needs to speak to a school adjustment counselor?

1482
02:23:41,148 --> 02:23:42,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Will that be available?

1483
02:23:42,208 --> 02:23:45,969
[SPEAKER_18]: And if so, how can a parent reach out or get the answer to who to call?

1484
02:23:47,029 --> 02:23:50,470
[SPEAKER_08]: So Brianna, that's also a Joan question that's on our list.

1485
02:23:51,391 --> 02:23:51,791
Okay.

1486
02:23:52,311 --> 02:23:55,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Joan, maybe you can start there then in your presentation.

1487
02:23:56,212 --> 02:23:56,492
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

1488
02:23:57,492 --> 02:23:58,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Can everyone hear me okay?

1489
02:23:59,973 --> 02:24:00,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1490
02:24:01,535 --> 02:24:07,478
[SPEAKER_24]: So I submitted my report regarding the Office of Pupil Services and Special Education.

1491
02:24:07,558 --> 02:24:11,240
[SPEAKER_24]: It's four pages long, so I'm not going to read it word for word at this point.

1492
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:18,444
[SPEAKER_24]: But I have been in contact with Stacey Shulman, who is our clinical supervisor.

1493
02:24:19,384 --> 02:24:20,625
[SPEAKER_24]: People can reach out to her.

1494
02:24:21,443 --> 02:24:26,344
[SPEAKER_24]: or a school adjustment counselor that is assigned to a building.

1495
02:24:26,404 --> 02:24:28,465
[SPEAKER_24]: And we can get that list out to people.

1496
02:24:28,905 --> 02:24:35,627
[SPEAKER_24]: If there is a student that is in need of services, feeling anxious, stressed, that sort of thing.

1497
02:24:36,467 --> 02:24:43,089
[SPEAKER_24]: She's also working with the Board of Health to look at what are some outside agencies that are available.

1498
02:24:43,689 --> 02:24:45,230
[SPEAKER_24]: Elliott is also available.

1499
02:24:47,070 --> 02:24:50,171
[SPEAKER_24]: So anything that we could do if they wanna alert the staff

1500
02:24:50,641 --> 02:24:57,007
[SPEAKER_24]: at the building or the principal at your respective building, we can reach out to service providers that way.

1501
02:24:57,928 --> 02:24:58,188
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

1502
02:24:58,348 --> 02:24:58,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1503
02:24:59,549 --> 02:25:04,654
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.

1504
02:25:05,314 --> 02:25:07,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Russo, then Member McLaughlin.

1505
02:25:09,918 --> 02:25:10,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1506
02:25:10,739 --> 02:25:13,622
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a question from Jamie Taylor.

1507
02:25:16,255 --> 02:25:24,082
[SPEAKER_22]: What will happen with the students who do not have technology and also for the 50% of students that teachers have yet to hear from?

1508
02:25:26,484 --> 02:25:29,307
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that the special ed or just in general?

1509
02:25:29,787 --> 02:25:30,588
[SPEAKER_22]: This is in general.

1510
02:25:30,628 --> 02:25:32,170
[SPEAKER_22]: I apologize for being out of order.

1511
02:25:33,311 --> 02:25:33,651
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

1512
02:25:35,012 --> 02:25:38,616
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you want me to answer it or do you want someone else to answer it?

1513
02:25:38,716 --> 02:25:41,238
[SPEAKER_24]: I can answer it from the special ed perspective.

1514
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:42,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1515
02:25:42,440 --> 02:25:50,302
[SPEAKER_24]: I would have them reach out to their building principals first and asking them why they haven't heard from the teachers.

1516
02:25:50,983 --> 02:25:56,864
[SPEAKER_24]: But if it's a special ed person, you can reach out to the building level coordinators at that point.

1517
02:25:57,725 --> 02:26:01,406
[SPEAKER_22]: I do want to clarify, it's the students that the teachers have not heard from.

1518
02:26:02,586 --> 02:26:02,966
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, OK.

1519
02:26:03,046 --> 02:26:04,366
[SPEAKER_22]: Teachers are reaching out.

1520
02:26:05,467 --> 02:26:06,487
[SPEAKER_22]: My own family was one of them.

1521
02:26:06,507 --> 02:26:07,087
[SPEAKER_22]: We got the call.

1522
02:26:10,383 --> 02:26:13,426
[SPEAKER_22]: The emails are going into the Google account.

1523
02:26:13,746 --> 02:26:16,729
[SPEAKER_22]: The students aren't replying or apparently even logging in.

1524
02:26:17,590 --> 02:26:23,236
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't really know how many students we're talking about, but apparently it's a lot of students that are not responding to teachers.

1525
02:26:25,258 --> 02:26:25,438
[SPEAKER_19]: So.

1526
02:26:27,821 --> 02:26:28,101
[SPEAKER_18]: Doctor.

1527
02:26:29,532 --> 02:26:43,161
[SPEAKER_19]: So I know that, I don't know if Paul DeLaver is still on this call, but I know this morning he and his assistant principals were reaching out, trying to reach out through phone calls to parents because they have been hearing for teachers.

1528
02:26:43,201 --> 02:26:50,986
[SPEAKER_19]: We encouraged teachers to share with administrators whether or not they were hearing from students who were participating.

1529
02:26:51,626 --> 02:26:58,288
[SPEAKER_19]: The administration has been working to communicate with those parents.

1530
02:26:58,348 --> 02:27:04,470
[SPEAKER_19]: So Paul, I don't know if you can add anything, add anything to that, what the success rate of that was.

1531
02:27:04,490 --> 02:27:18,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've been doing is, for the high school, and I can only speak at the high school level, what we've been doing is having teachers that have not been successful connecting to give us a list by grade level.

1532
02:27:18,754 --> 02:27:20,555
[SPEAKER_01]: So assistant principals, as Joan mentioned,

1533
02:27:21,458 --> 02:27:22,698
[SPEAKER_01]: have been compiling.

1534
02:27:22,738 --> 02:27:36,982
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a running list that's been going on and today was one of those days where we sort of hit the phones running to try to connect as much as we could because the hard part for us initially was using our phones to kind of connect out.

1535
02:27:38,262 --> 02:27:42,923
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do the star six, seven thing, but that doesn't mean you always end up getting a response.

1536
02:27:43,623 --> 02:27:45,343
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did social distance today.

1537
02:27:45,383 --> 02:27:47,004
[SPEAKER_01]: We all went into our own offices.

1538
02:27:47,064 --> 02:27:47,384
[SPEAKER_01]: We never

1539
02:27:48,092 --> 02:27:51,894
[SPEAKER_01]: went in contact with everyone, but we took our list and we sort of went down the line.

1540
02:27:53,075 --> 02:27:58,358
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a good, successful rate, but we're also trying to figure out the reasons why there's no connection.

1541
02:27:58,438 --> 02:27:59,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they not have a device?

1542
02:28:00,179 --> 02:28:01,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they not have internet?

1543
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:03,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Things of that nature.

1544
02:28:04,621 --> 02:28:14,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Is their social emotional wellbeing in a spot where having assignments being utilized at this point in time, especially during the enrichment time,

1545
02:28:15,892 --> 02:28:18,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that has been holding people back?

1546
02:28:18,533 --> 02:28:32,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to go back to this plan, I think the good part about this plan of what we're seeing with people that haven't connected is that we sort of now have a direction of what to do, even on an admin side.

1547
02:28:33,679 --> 02:28:36,320
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's where we're at mostly at the high school.

1548
02:28:36,340 --> 02:28:40,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I can't speak to other schools, but I'm pretty sure they're following the same protocols.

1549
02:28:46,383 --> 02:28:46,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1550
02:28:46,864 --> 02:28:51,050
[SPEAKER_18]: Paul's just going to take over for a minute while I've been on Zoom since three.

1551
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:52,573
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's go to the bathroom.

1552
02:28:53,614 --> 02:28:53,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Joan.

1553
02:28:57,613 --> 02:29:16,765
[SPEAKER_22]: And just to follow up on that, so, you know, I think that one of the challenges, you know, even before this, during the summer institute at the MASC, we talked about having connectivity at home and how a remarkable number of children have connectivity at home, meaning they have an iPhone.

1554
02:29:18,432 --> 02:29:19,613
[SPEAKER_22]: they can get on the internet.

1555
02:29:20,234 --> 02:29:26,579
[SPEAKER_22]: It is not a device or connection that is going to function for performing your real schoolwork.

1556
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:34,647
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know that it might be too soon to get the results from Dr. Cushing on the survey that was done, but

1557
02:29:36,605 --> 02:29:43,847
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it putting the cart before the horse to actually say, well, what are we going to do about kids whose only connection at home is their parent iPhone?

1558
02:29:44,267 --> 02:29:45,508
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's not going to work.

1559
02:29:45,568 --> 02:29:51,269
[SPEAKER_22]: Are we going to actually be calling up Verizon and having internet installed in their homes?

1560
02:29:55,451 --> 02:29:56,351
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

1561
02:29:57,971 --> 02:30:00,132
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. McLaughlin, I'm trying to unmute you.

1562
02:30:01,648 --> 02:30:02,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1563
02:30:02,748 --> 02:30:16,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, again, getting, you know, sort of thinking of that in terms of the survey, and I know that I've spoken with the English language department and the special education department, and I'm sure Mr. Teixeira will be talking soon as well.

1564
02:30:17,033 --> 02:30:29,918
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know, you know, and with Mr. DeLeva, and I'm assuming probably people in their own buildings are going through their list collectively and figuring out who's been able to be contacted and who hasn't.

1565
02:30:30,477 --> 02:30:45,046
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, getting towards the information or what have you, asking at that point, especially for the folks that haven't been contacted, asking them while they're being contacted at this point, sort of, do you have connectivity issues or not?

1566
02:30:45,086 --> 02:30:47,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So starting to build, again, that database, that information.

1567
02:30:48,008 --> 02:30:53,531
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also think that that could be addressed in potentially survey form.

1568
02:30:54,712 --> 02:30:59,635
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think that, I know that the EL and special education department, and as Mr. DeLava said,

1569
02:31:00,694 --> 02:31:08,779
[SPEAKER_08]: The high school and assistant principals are going through their list and they're literally creating, I don't know if it's global spreadsheets or what, students who haven't responded.

1570
02:31:08,819 --> 02:31:16,983
[SPEAKER_08]: So adding a column to those student responses, you know, do you have connectivity, seems to make a lot of sense as we're trying to be more uniform across the district.

1571
02:31:19,445 --> 02:31:22,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is what our lists are saying.

1572
02:31:22,146 --> 02:31:28,169
[SPEAKER_01]: We're even replying what our communication is with those families as of today.

1573
02:31:28,189 --> 02:31:29,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So we added a whole new

1574
02:31:29,661 --> 02:31:31,402
[SPEAKER_01]: notes column to go with that as well.

1575
02:31:34,944 --> 02:31:35,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's great.

1576
02:31:35,904 --> 02:31:48,110
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe, again, getting to the point of Google shared folders, like if these standard documents could be shared across the district so that everyone's sort of doing this in a uniform way, it seems like it would make a lot of sense.

1577
02:31:48,170 --> 02:31:50,411
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, just putting that on.

1578
02:31:53,092 --> 02:31:53,532
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1579
02:31:54,073 --> 02:31:55,533
[SPEAKER_24]: Joan, do you want to continue?

1580
02:31:56,774 --> 02:31:59,015
[SPEAKER_24]: So basically, Dr. Riccardelli,

1581
02:31:59,402 --> 02:32:05,647
[SPEAKER_24]: basically told us, told everyone what the special education department has been doing and where we're heading.

1582
02:32:05,687 --> 02:32:14,815
[SPEAKER_24]: So I didn't know if anyone had questions in regards to that, or you needed me to go into the, um, the report, the update that I gave any further.

1583
02:32:14,835 --> 02:32:20,599
[SPEAKER_18]: I think as long as, since it's, it's almost eight, so maybe questions.

1584
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:27,185
[SPEAKER_18]: And then if you could make the report available for the public and for us to read in depth, that'll be sure.

1585
02:32:27,205 --> 02:32:28,746
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that as long as we have that, thank you.

1586
02:32:31,434 --> 02:32:32,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Any questions?

1587
02:32:34,416 --> 02:32:35,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin.

1588
02:32:46,126 --> 02:32:49,548
[SPEAKER_08]: On Zoom with Joan.

1589
02:32:50,629 --> 02:32:55,413
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's been pushed out to the community and folks can talk to the director of pupil services.

1590
02:32:56,278 --> 02:33:00,422
[SPEAKER_08]: 6 o'clock on Wednesday as well with additional questions and answers, so that will be helpful.

1591
02:33:01,062 --> 02:33:04,385
[SPEAKER_24]: Bonnie, we didn't hear the first part that you said.

1592
02:33:04,425 --> 02:33:06,727
[SPEAKER_24]: You were on mute.

1593
02:33:07,688 --> 02:33:08,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Was I?

1594
02:33:08,109 --> 02:33:09,730
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I didn't hear the whole thing.

1595
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:09,950
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1596
02:33:10,231 --> 02:33:10,571
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

1597
02:33:10,791 --> 02:33:15,135
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to make sure the community knows that we're having a question and answer.

1598
02:33:15,815 --> 02:33:20,740
[SPEAKER_08]: CPAC is hosting a question and answer period with you on Wednesday from 6 to 7.

1599
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:22,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a Zoom push out.

1600
02:33:23,578 --> 02:33:36,064
[SPEAKER_08]: where folks can get online and ask questions to the Director of Pupil Services, but also if they want to submit questions in advance, it is better because then it's better prepared and people have more time.

1601
02:33:36,625 --> 02:33:44,148
[SPEAKER_08]: So some questions that have just come across now, Joan, and if you just have a short list to sort of address these where you can, it would be really helpful.

1602
02:33:46,338 --> 02:33:49,240
[SPEAKER_08]: One is people are asking a lot about IEP timelines.

1603
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:54,543
[SPEAKER_08]: So how are we addressing initial evaluations, re-evaluations, and expired IEPs?

1604
02:33:56,644 --> 02:34:03,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Two is the guidance from the report is saying children should work independently or teachers should be able to provide work for children to work independently.

1605
02:34:04,649 --> 02:34:11,853
[SPEAKER_08]: As we know, there are a lot of children in our community, in the disability community, that are not able to work independently.

1606
02:34:12,174 --> 02:34:14,115
[SPEAKER_08]: And what are we doing in those instances?

1607
02:34:15,083 --> 02:34:22,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Also drilling down with that a little bit more, how are we addressing children who have had one-to-one paraprofessionals?

1608
02:34:24,089 --> 02:34:30,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Next question is paraprofessionals and computers, whether they have access, how are they getting them?

1609
02:34:30,774 --> 02:34:38,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Are paras attending the staff meetings that are being scheduled regularly so that they're being included in part of the conversation?

1610
02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:43,082
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked a little bit about this ourselves, Joan, but I want to point out to the community

1611
02:34:43,596 --> 02:35:09,410
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot of families that are really struggling right now with children who may have been in out of district placements or elsewhere with mental health issues, self injurious behavior, things that, you know, in addition to what we're all dealing with on a pandemic level and being in social isolation at home are just so much more exacerbated with these particular families and how are we supporting them?

1612
02:35:10,001 --> 02:35:10,761
[SPEAKER_08]: and their families.

1613
02:35:10,881 --> 02:35:18,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to the point what you were saying about Stacey Shulman a little while ago, but also how that addresses families and not just students.

1614
02:35:18,105 --> 02:35:23,028
[SPEAKER_08]: So how are we handling compensatory services for therapies?

1615
02:35:23,368 --> 02:35:33,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So for people who don't know a lot about special education, students may get therapies like speech and language, occupational therapy, physical therapy.

1616
02:35:34,193 --> 02:35:37,335
[SPEAKER_08]: DESE is not requiring, as the guidance said,

1617
02:35:37,788 --> 02:35:40,470
[SPEAKER_08]: not requiring those therapies to occur during this time.

1618
02:35:40,490 --> 02:35:43,193
[SPEAKER_08]: However, they are part of IEPs.

1619
02:35:43,313 --> 02:35:46,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And so how do we address compensatory services?

1620
02:35:46,355 --> 02:35:51,360
[SPEAKER_08]: So if children aren't provided their IEP services, typically there's compensatory services.

1621
02:35:52,060 --> 02:35:56,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Special education is also very legally dense.

1622
02:35:56,764 --> 02:36:02,329
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's hard to answer a lot of these questions, but just sort of putting them in people's minds to be thinking about.

1623
02:36:03,530 --> 02:36:04,911
[SPEAKER_08]: What social emotional connections?

1624
02:36:04,951 --> 02:36:06,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm almost done, two more.

1625
02:36:07,015 --> 02:36:10,576
[SPEAKER_08]: What social-emotional connections are we providing to our out-of-district students?

1626
02:36:11,797 --> 02:36:32,583
[SPEAKER_08]: So for our out-of-district students who are, you know, sometimes sent to Lexington or Belmont or, you know, Beverly or what have you, who don't have necessarily connections to their out-of-district placements because those students are all from other areas as well, how are we connecting our out-of-district students to the community

1627
02:36:33,158 --> 02:36:35,059
[SPEAKER_08]: in this social isolation time?

1628
02:36:35,119 --> 02:36:41,582
[SPEAKER_08]: So for example, we know that every student is assigned to a school because that's the way out of district placement works.

1629
02:36:41,662 --> 02:36:49,766
[SPEAKER_08]: So even if you're out of district, you're still part of a school, you're able to take extracurricular activities at that school, you're supposed to be a part of the life of the school.

1630
02:36:50,306 --> 02:37:01,171
[SPEAKER_08]: So is there a way that we can be connecting these children, these students to social opportunities, meetings, online meetings, recess, morning meetings, what have you?

1631
02:37:02,220 --> 02:37:05,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Extended school year is another big question.

1632
02:37:05,442 --> 02:37:08,283
[SPEAKER_08]: And are we posting and sharing resources for remote learning?

1633
02:37:08,343 --> 02:37:14,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, these Google level, I mean, these Google folders grade level where we're sharing information amongst people.

1634
02:37:14,506 --> 02:37:18,588
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that's a long list for you, Joan, and we'll answer more on Wednesday.

1635
02:37:18,628 --> 02:37:23,790
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you could get sort of the meat of that in any way that you can, I'd appreciate it.

1636
02:37:24,691 --> 02:37:24,931
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

1637
02:37:24,971 --> 02:37:28,953
[SPEAKER_24]: So we've had a lot of meetings with DESPIE in the last couple of weeks.

1638
02:37:30,435 --> 02:37:34,679
[SPEAKER_24]: Districts are still waiting for guidance regarding IEP timelines.

1639
02:37:35,679 --> 02:37:39,082
[SPEAKER_24]: They have told us that we can hold virtual meetings.

1640
02:37:39,702 --> 02:37:41,063
[SPEAKER_24]: We have started to do that.

1641
02:37:41,123 --> 02:37:49,309
[SPEAKER_24]: Our evaluation team leaders are reaching out to parents to conduct annual review meetings that were supposed to be held within the last two weeks.

1642
02:37:49,830 --> 02:37:52,171
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're moving in that direction to get them done.

1643
02:37:52,211 --> 02:37:56,995
[SPEAKER_24]: But we haven't had direct guidance regarding initial evaluations,

1644
02:37:57,408 --> 02:37:59,990
[SPEAKER_24]: re-evaluation timelines, that sort of thing.

1645
02:38:00,050 --> 02:38:03,652
[SPEAKER_24]: So, we were told on Thursday that guidance would be coming.

1646
02:38:03,832 --> 02:38:06,974
[SPEAKER_24]: So, as soon as I am aware of it, I will let people know.

1647
02:38:06,994 --> 02:38:21,323
[SPEAKER_24]: The independent work, I think that is going to be – I don't have a definite answer because I want to reach out to the teachers of students that have the one-to-one and how that's going to look.

1648
02:38:24,043 --> 02:38:32,209
[SPEAKER_24]: advisory to us that we can't provide all the services in the exact same manner, but what does that look like for students on one-to-one?

1649
02:38:32,249 --> 02:38:41,896
[SPEAKER_24]: So that would be me reaching out with those program levels, teachers and the paraprofessionals that provide one-on-one and what it may look like.

1650
02:38:42,536 --> 02:38:45,979
[SPEAKER_24]: And that also goes to with the students working independently as well.

1651
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:52,504
[SPEAKER_24]: The paras, I don't believe that they have been giving access to

1652
02:38:53,258 --> 02:39:15,995
[SPEAKER_24]: Chromebooks, but that's something I think we need to look at on a individual basis with the paraprofessional, what their role is going to be and what services they're going to be providing to students and who needs that access to a Chromebook to do remote learning, to be involved with virtual morning meetings, that sort of thing.

1653
02:39:16,075 --> 02:39:21,399
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it would be helpful for the paras to be involved so they can

1654
02:39:22,057 --> 02:39:29,339
[SPEAKER_24]: So the students can see the staff members who've been consistent with them since August to make those connections with them.

1655
02:39:29,419 --> 02:39:32,299
[SPEAKER_24]: So we will be working with the paraprofessionals regarding that.

1656
02:39:33,759 --> 02:39:44,562
[SPEAKER_24]: Compensatory services, that is up in the, it's not up in the air, but it's a discussion that we're gonna have to have with individual families at their IEP team meetings.

1657
02:39:44,582 --> 02:39:48,643
[SPEAKER_24]: We're gonna try to provide as many services as we possibly can.

1658
02:39:48,663 --> 02:39:50,183
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm asking,

1659
02:39:51,554 --> 02:40:05,918
[SPEAKER_24]: teachers to document the work that they're giving, where the student was, where they're progressing, and then if there's a need for extended school year services or compensatory services, that would be determined at the team meeting when the teams meet.

1660
02:40:06,719 --> 02:40:08,519
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't have, oh, was there one more?

1661
02:40:08,539 --> 02:40:11,740
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, community access.

1662
02:40:12,380 --> 02:40:17,742
[SPEAKER_24]: I feel like if the out-of-district families are looking for community

1663
02:40:18,897 --> 02:40:25,943
[SPEAKER_24]: connection, then I would like them to reach out to me and we could take a look at that, what that would look like for each individual child.

1664
02:40:26,363 --> 02:40:33,368
[SPEAKER_24]: We want to be thoughtful about it and make that appropriate connection with their community school or their in-district school.

1665
02:40:34,669 --> 02:40:37,111
[SPEAKER_24]: Would it be a community meeting, a morning meeting?

1666
02:40:37,151 --> 02:40:39,072
[SPEAKER_24]: Would it be some sort of activity?

1667
02:40:39,453 --> 02:40:41,734
[SPEAKER_24]: Whatever it may be, I would want to look at that.

1668
02:40:41,854 --> 02:40:46,698
[SPEAKER_24]: What are the opportunities and then how we can provide those to the students and their families.

1669
02:40:48,042 --> 02:40:49,984
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I answered all, I'm not sure.

1670
02:40:50,004 --> 02:40:51,486
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot, thank you.

1671
02:40:52,106 --> 02:40:52,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.

1672
02:40:53,087 --> 02:40:59,854
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure that if families have additional questions, again, Wednesday, they can be on the call, but they should also be reaching out to their ETLs, right?

1673
02:41:00,475 --> 02:41:01,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct, yes.

1674
02:41:01,516 --> 02:41:10,906
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to point out to the mayor and to, I don't know if Christine's still on here, but those compensatory services and ESY costs are real.

1675
02:41:12,283 --> 02:41:23,007
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that the guidance from DESE was to provide as many services as we can now so that we're not dealing with all those compensatory services and compensatory service costs later.

1676
02:41:23,987 --> 02:41:27,008
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're really something that needs to be considered.

1677
02:41:27,048 --> 02:41:36,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And also toward that end and around gathering data for staff, families can also be gathering data at home just in terms of showing and documenting any

1678
02:41:37,613 --> 02:41:48,740
[SPEAKER_08]: regression if there is any, because as we're seeing from our survey, the two biggest concerns right now in the CPAC survey is regression and social isolation.

1679
02:41:49,440 --> 02:41:52,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, thank you.

1680
02:41:52,162 --> 02:41:52,202
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1681
02:41:59,347 --> 02:41:59,807
[SPEAKER_22]: Member Russo.

1682
02:42:00,773 --> 02:42:01,074
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1683
02:42:01,094 --> 02:42:08,095
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a question from a special education teacher, and I will just actually

1684
02:42:10,109 --> 02:42:31,354
[SPEAKER_22]: say what I would hope would happen, is can we, can someone make it a priority to create either a Google Doc or some kind of a format for teachers to begin keeping track of their purchases of student materials, mailing of envelopes, you know, the cost of stamps.

1685
02:42:32,871 --> 02:42:39,734
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't, hopefully we don't need to have an actual motion to say we're going to reimburse teachers for all of this stuff.

1686
02:42:41,014 --> 02:42:49,618
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm more than happy to make that motion if if somebody isn't going to just say we'll take care of it because I mean I'm not suggesting teachers be out, you know, ordering.

1687
02:42:50,581 --> 02:42:53,683
[SPEAKER_22]: everything off of Amazon they can find, and that's not, I think, the question.

1688
02:42:53,723 --> 02:43:00,347
[SPEAKER_22]: The question is, is if they are providing materials and mailing it to students' homes, we should be reimbursing them without any question.

1689
02:43:00,768 --> 02:43:13,316
[SPEAKER_22]: So it'd be better to start ahead of time with, here's the format of the document that you all should be filling, the teacher should be filling out, so that we don't later on say, oh, well, you didn't keep track of this detail.

1690
02:43:15,737 --> 02:43:19,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Dr. Edouard, Vincent, do you have anything to add?

1691
02:43:21,392 --> 02:43:25,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a few people still working on certain days of the week.

1692
02:43:25,994 --> 02:43:28,936
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a mail machine here at the school.

1693
02:43:30,317 --> 02:43:38,461
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm concerned about is having something that would be like a cut lunch and not really being able to monitor

1694
02:43:39,701 --> 02:43:40,862
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the grade levels?

1695
02:43:41,663 --> 02:43:44,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's the frequency of that actually happening?

1696
02:43:45,346 --> 02:43:50,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think we can work collaboratively with the MTA, with Ms.

1697
02:43:51,011 --> 02:43:55,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Douglas, and figure out, like, try to create a Google Doc where we could

1698
02:43:56,195 --> 02:44:14,636
[SPEAKER_03]: have teachers put the information in and it might be something that maybe more early childhood people might want to take more advantage of that as opposed to some of the upper grades, but I think it needs to be something that we more closely manage and the fact that we do have

1699
02:44:16,699 --> 02:44:35,577
[SPEAKER_03]: critical staff members coming in one or two days a week to deal with payroll and paying bills, that if it was something where it was a particular day a week that we said we were going to do a mailing, we could potentially have some of that go out through the school.

1700
02:44:36,703 --> 02:44:52,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, as I say that, I'm still thinking about social distancing and really being careful because, again, as Marianne O'Connor said at the beginning of the meeting, that we followed good social distancing

1701
02:44:53,485 --> 02:44:56,046
[SPEAKER_03]: We made it through that first two-week window.

1702
02:44:56,286 --> 02:45:06,308
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, anyone could become affected just by going to the regular supermarket or the pharmacy or to a Staples or someplace.

1703
02:45:07,149 --> 02:45:15,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something that let us work on that with the union and come up with something that is mutually beneficial for everyone.

1704
02:45:15,331 --> 02:45:16,771
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be great.

1705
02:45:16,811 --> 02:45:17,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1706
02:45:17,611 --> 02:45:17,992
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1707
02:45:18,532 --> 02:45:19,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Van de Kloot?

1708
02:45:19,868 --> 02:45:22,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I just wanted to inquire about our homeless students.

1709
02:45:23,110 --> 02:45:26,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we done any outreach to the students who are in Medford?

1710
02:45:27,253 --> 02:45:31,416
[SPEAKER_02]: And have we given them any support in particular?

1711
02:45:32,657 --> 02:45:35,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's in charge of doing so?

1712
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:37,740
[SPEAKER_18]: Joan.

1713
02:45:40,623 --> 02:45:46,967
[SPEAKER_24]: So I have reached out to the ETLs and the principals regarding the homeless students.

1714
02:45:47,760 --> 02:46:08,216
[SPEAKER_24]: And we also have a connection with Marie Cassidy from Medford Family Network, who's been doing a lot of outreach to the shelters, making sure that the students are getting what they need for meals, for also any additional supplies that they may need, and then they are being provided with the same educational opportunities that our students are.

1715
02:46:10,357 --> 02:46:10,537
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1716
02:46:12,636 --> 02:46:18,499
[SPEAKER_24]: And she's also working with DCF and other outside agencies to continue to support those students.

1717
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:20,220
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1718
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:28,685
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Teixeira, I don't know if you're still on, if you have anything to add with regards to the English learners program.

1719
02:46:30,686 --> 02:46:31,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Did he sign?

1720
02:46:31,426 --> 02:46:32,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, there he is.

1721
02:46:32,227 --> 02:46:32,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Still there.

1722
02:46:33,307 --> 02:46:34,908
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did the report.

1723
02:46:34,948 --> 02:46:39,571
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to read it, but does anyone have any questions on the report?

1724
02:46:42,733 --> 02:46:43,654
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McLaughlin?

1725
02:46:47,096 --> 02:46:55,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say thank you and I'm assuming Mayor Lungo-Kern that these will all be available for the public on the website?

1726
02:46:55,883 --> 02:46:57,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe they already are, Dr. Vincent.

1727
02:46:58,365 --> 02:47:00,587
[SPEAKER_03]: All documents are uploaded on the website.

1728
02:47:00,627 --> 02:47:01,668
[SPEAKER_03]: They're available right now.

1729
02:47:02,809 --> 02:47:03,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, great.

1730
02:47:04,130 --> 02:47:04,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else?

1731
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:06,532
[SPEAKER_18]: Member McStone, did you raise your hand?

1732
02:47:08,819 --> 02:47:09,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, okay.

1733
02:47:09,840 --> 02:47:10,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kretz.

1734
02:47:11,021 --> 02:47:11,241
Yes.

1735
02:47:12,482 --> 02:47:14,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my, oh, off mute, thank you.

1736
02:47:14,964 --> 02:47:17,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Texeria, for the report.

1737
02:47:17,746 --> 02:47:29,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a question, because I know in your report, it mentioned that you haven't been able to get in touch with 30 of the 480 English learners, and you continue to do the outreach.

1738
02:47:29,976 --> 02:47:33,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, did you do a mailing as well, Mr. Texeria?

1739
02:47:34,060 --> 02:47:37,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Like an actual mailing to the families, their address?

1740
02:47:38,701 --> 02:47:40,442
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not a postal mailing.

1741
02:47:40,502 --> 02:47:45,143
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all been emailed, but the EL teachers are the ones doing the outreach.

1742
02:47:45,263 --> 02:47:55,946
[SPEAKER_12]: They've had systems in place prior to the closure of schools where they would reach out using online texting called talking points.

1743
02:47:57,006 --> 02:47:57,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Some use remind 101.

1744
02:47:59,808 --> 02:48:01,390
[SPEAKER_12]: So they've always had this outreach.

1745
02:48:01,450 --> 02:48:06,634
[SPEAKER_12]: So even with that, there are the 30 students that we haven't been able to get in touch with.

1746
02:48:07,194 --> 02:48:10,897
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they've reached out to the translators who are trying to call home.

1747
02:48:11,778 --> 02:48:15,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody talked about using phones to call and dialing star 671st.

1748
02:48:16,702 --> 02:48:20,045
[SPEAKER_12]: They're finding that they don't pick up if it's a private number.

1749
02:48:20,185 --> 02:48:22,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, they can't leave their personal cell phone number.

1750
02:48:23,917 --> 02:48:24,958
[SPEAKER_12]: to call them back.

1751
02:48:25,098 --> 02:48:37,205
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not like we have the advantage of being in school, but the teachers are continually doing the outreach and they're keeping a log of which students they can't get in touch with and which students aren't responding to what they put out on Google.

1752
02:48:38,465 --> 02:48:46,470
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we'll have that list and we'll just kind of keep going at it to try to get to the kids that aren't responding or the families that aren't responding.

1753
02:48:47,530 --> 02:48:48,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1754
02:48:49,011 --> 02:48:49,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1755
02:48:50,372 --> 02:48:52,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other questions for member Russo?

1756
02:48:54,448 --> 02:49:01,014
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I was just going to, if we're done with this item, are we ready for the last item on the agenda?

1757
02:49:01,675 --> 02:49:10,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a motion to accept the last two discussions on what would be the second and third item of our agenda?

1758
02:49:11,203 --> 02:49:11,944
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to accept.

1759
02:49:11,964 --> 02:49:13,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to accept.

1760
02:49:13,565 --> 02:49:14,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Graham, do you have a question first?

1761
02:49:15,147 --> 02:49:17,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1762
02:49:17,549 --> 02:49:18,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we, oh.

1763
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:20,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me.

1764
02:49:21,101 --> 02:49:21,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1765
02:49:21,661 --> 02:49:21,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1766
02:49:22,562 --> 02:49:34,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I was noticing in the the report and the conversation around having not been able to reach 30 out of 480 students felt like a good sort of

1767
02:49:36,198 --> 02:49:51,308
[SPEAKER_04]: way to understand what's happening in terms of how many students are we reaching and I'd like for us as we talk about the entire school population at all levels for us to figure out how we can start to assess where we're at

1768
02:49:51,968 --> 02:49:55,450
[SPEAKER_04]: in all buildings and with all of our populations in a future meeting.

1769
02:49:55,470 --> 02:50:03,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't have to be on Monday, but as we continue to progress forward, I would hope that we're reaching more and more and more families.

1770
02:50:04,334 --> 02:50:10,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that's not happening, I want us to be thinking about whether we need to be changing our strategy.

1771
02:50:10,256 --> 02:50:13,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So can we put that on an agenda for a future meeting?

1772
02:50:14,995 --> 02:50:23,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, motion for approval to place that on the future meeting agenda, maybe a week from, do you want Monday or two weeks from Monday?

1773
02:50:25,218 --> 02:50:25,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Two weeks from Monday.

1774
02:50:26,238 --> 02:50:28,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Two weeks from Monday, we'll get those numbers, yes.

1775
02:50:29,019 --> 02:50:34,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member Rousseau.

1776
02:50:34,240 --> 02:50:34,980
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

1777
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:35,660
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1778
02:50:36,261 --> 02:50:36,821
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1779
02:50:36,981 --> 02:50:38,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, motion passes.

1780
02:50:40,382 --> 02:50:41,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Maureen, do you have?

1781
02:50:44,860 --> 02:50:48,115
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi everybody, I just wanted a quick follow-up.

1782
02:50:50,107 --> 02:51:01,593
[SPEAKER_26]: Anybody that needs any information about scholarships or guidance information, you could go to medfordhighguidance.com and all that information is located there.

1783
02:51:02,934 --> 02:51:14,600
[SPEAKER_26]: Several of the scholarships have had extended deadlines and the students have had emails from that website from our department

1784
02:51:15,140 --> 02:51:17,501
[SPEAKER_26]: anytime any updates come up.

1785
02:51:18,102 --> 02:51:19,943
[SPEAKER_26]: So they have been in the loop.

1786
02:51:21,363 --> 02:51:25,185
[SPEAKER_26]: And many of them have already applied for a lot of the scholarships as well.

1787
02:51:25,225 --> 02:51:30,308
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're constantly sending email reminders out as we get information.

1788
02:51:30,328 --> 02:51:32,028
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just wanted to make sure everyone knew that.

1789
02:51:32,389 --> 02:51:35,990
[SPEAKER_26]: I can follow up at a later meeting a little bit more.

1790
02:51:39,052 --> 02:51:39,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1791
02:51:43,035 --> 02:51:55,085
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so we have proposed meeting schedule, regular school committee and budget committee of the whole, Superintendent Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent and Assistant Superintendent of Finance, Christine Patterson.

1792
02:51:57,447 --> 02:52:06,334
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to approve by member Rousseau, seconded by member, oh, question, member Van de Kloet.

1793
02:52:06,845 --> 02:52:22,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so I looked at this and again, I realized that part of it is because of the school vacation week, but I feel very uncomfortable that we would have a meeting on the 13th and then not again to the 4th.

1794
02:52:23,311 --> 02:52:28,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it's really important that we add a meeting on the 27th.

1795
02:52:28,552 --> 02:52:30,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need a full agenda.

1796
02:52:31,759 --> 02:52:36,432
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting, but I need an opportunity where we are brought together and we can talk and ask questions.

1797
02:52:37,053 --> 02:52:38,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not, you know,

1798
02:52:40,470 --> 02:52:48,856
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a long gap and I'm just not comfortable with, this was a very, very long two weeks that your members had.

1799
02:52:49,257 --> 02:52:56,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know you were working really hard and we appreciate that, but in our role, that was an extraordinarily long time.

1800
02:52:56,922 --> 02:53:03,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I see that just by chance, and I understand that this is the way it would have been under our regular meetings,

1801
02:53:04,428 --> 02:53:17,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But under this circumstance, I'm just not comfortable with that amount of time between our meetings, especially because, you know, May 4th, we may be starting school again, we don't know.

1802
02:53:21,670 --> 02:53:43,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like because right now Christine is under tremendous pressure to complete all of the pre-budgets because all of those meetings stopped and because we tried to honor the previous schedule that was in place she was going to be trying to meet with if you look at that schedule

1803
02:53:45,022 --> 02:53:50,164
[SPEAKER_03]: she increased some of the numbers of groups that were presenting in order to get us back on track.

1804
02:53:50,884 --> 02:54:11,614
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would propose to either do the sixth and push the second meeting out to the 20th, because the amount of work that we're doing in the background, I cannot see adding another meeting on top of that, where we're gonna, right now, this has been a three hour meeting today, and the amount of preparation

1805
02:54:12,674 --> 02:54:14,316
[SPEAKER_03]: People were working all weekend.

1806
02:54:15,097 --> 02:54:16,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We are working non-stop.

1807
02:54:16,638 --> 02:54:21,263
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very difficult not physically being in the same place.

1808
02:54:21,803 --> 02:54:25,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that the workload needs to be manageable for us.

1809
02:54:25,947 --> 02:54:36,057
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't mind keeping the 6th next Monday and not doing the 13th and meeting on the 20th because we do need to have planning time

1810
02:54:37,258 --> 02:54:38,459
[SPEAKER_03]: to get work done.

1811
02:54:38,660 --> 02:54:54,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Even something as it seems simple, the request from member Graham about keeping track of all of the families, but in order to meet with the administrators, to talk with the union, to talk with the teachers, to have every single teacher keep track

1812
02:54:55,439 --> 02:55:05,865
[SPEAKER_03]: of that, that's gonna take time to say, you know, out of my 20, you know, students, I've been able to track down 18, and I haven't been able to track down two.

1813
02:55:06,385 --> 02:55:17,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a lot of things, it seems like it's something that can be done quickly, but it takes time to get that together and to be able to present something meaningful.

1814
02:55:18,100 --> 02:55:20,361
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I think that sounds reasonable, the 6th and the 20th.

1815
02:55:20,401 --> 02:55:21,101
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Van de Kloot?

1816
02:55:21,521 --> 02:55:31,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only reason I didn't suggest the 20th was because of the fact that it is during that school vacation week.

1817
02:55:32,245 --> 02:55:32,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm free.

1818
02:55:34,736 --> 02:55:37,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So which of course in today and doesn't exist anymore.

1819
02:55:37,817 --> 02:55:51,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just mentioning that again, the sense of we have a difference in terms of and this certainly was discussed over these last two weeks in terms of the school committees need

1820
02:55:51,922 --> 02:56:01,956
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to talk to each other without having the full agenda, without having the, you know, because I understand and appreciate how much work this meeting is.

1821
02:56:02,476 --> 02:56:06,242
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we set it up so that we have a touch base opportunity?

1822
02:56:06,723 --> 02:56:28,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you are aware, I've been sending significant communications to you, the school committee, and I can continue to send updates in terms of what is happening in terms of my own productivity and really being able to do the best on behalf of the district.

1823
02:56:29,223 --> 02:56:30,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to be able to

1824
02:56:31,185 --> 02:56:36,508
[SPEAKER_03]: have time to be able to prepare these reports and be able to gather the data.

1825
02:56:37,629 --> 02:56:44,334
[SPEAKER_03]: No one is on campus per se on a daily basis, so everything is not immediately at our fingertips.

1826
02:56:44,534 --> 02:56:46,595
[SPEAKER_03]: It's multiple calls.

1827
02:56:47,175 --> 02:56:48,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It's multiple Zoom meetings.

1828
02:56:49,257 --> 02:56:51,178
[SPEAKER_03]: It's conflicting Zoom meetings.

1829
02:56:51,618 --> 02:56:57,002
[SPEAKER_03]: It's DESI calls from the commissioner and waiting for time-sensitive updates.

1830
02:56:58,532 --> 02:57:04,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's meeting, which is a special meeting, this meeting alone is three hours long in duration right now.

1831
02:57:05,476 --> 02:57:11,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And this isn't a regular meeting and we need at our next meeting, we're gonna have an executive session.

1832
02:57:11,660 --> 02:57:23,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am just saying we need to really be cognizant of the amount of time and the breadth of what can reasonably be done and done well.

1833
02:57:26,924 --> 02:57:27,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Dr. Vincent.

1834
02:57:28,685 --> 02:57:35,807
[SPEAKER_18]: So is, do you want to make a motion for the 6th and the 20th versus, I remember Randa Kloot, that was your motion.

1835
02:57:36,247 --> 02:57:43,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like my colleagues to weigh in some, and I would like, you know, some concern about the 20th was vacation week so far.

1836
02:57:43,930 --> 02:57:48,711
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're comfortable, you know, in this one, I'd give to Marisa and say the 20th.

1837
02:57:48,811 --> 02:57:53,133
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seems very difficult to have a meeting on the 13th and not again to the 4th.

1838
02:57:54,521 --> 02:57:58,524
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm fine with the 20th myself, member McLaughlin and member Russo, member Kratz.

1839
02:58:00,345 --> 02:58:00,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1840
02:58:00,825 --> 02:58:06,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I can appreciate the hard work, Dr. Vincent and staff.

1841
02:58:06,369 --> 02:58:10,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you guys have been going into all hours and weekend hours.

1842
02:58:10,572 --> 02:58:16,636
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do also feel a commitment very much to the constituents who voted for us to

1843
02:58:17,801 --> 02:58:19,502
[SPEAKER_08]: represent them and to be updated.

1844
02:58:19,542 --> 02:58:23,423
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have been updating us, and you've been doing an excellent job at updating us.

1845
02:58:23,463 --> 02:58:28,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I think your memos to us have been very thorough and useful.

1846
02:58:28,926 --> 02:58:34,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, those aren't shared with the community, and they're feeling a need for updates as well.

1847
02:58:34,708 --> 02:58:47,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we need to think as a group, and I'm asking our colleagues to be thinking as a group, as how we can make this work for everybody so that we're getting updates, the community's getting updates, and we're able to

1848
02:58:47,910 --> 02:59:00,415
[SPEAKER_08]: feel like it's more regular because with all that you're doing, I do hear from our voting members that they are feeling that there needs to be more in terms of community update and family and community engagement.

1849
02:59:00,455 --> 02:59:05,157
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what's so important about this meeting is that we now have, we have 60 people on this call.

1850
02:59:05,218 --> 02:59:05,818
[SPEAKER_08]: We started with 80.

1851
02:59:06,934 --> 02:59:09,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So 60 have held through for three hours as well.

1852
02:59:09,476 --> 02:59:13,098
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure there's lots of other things they would like to be doing too.

1853
02:59:13,198 --> 02:59:19,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hear you, but I am also asking, and I am also asking our colleagues for some creative solutions around this.

1854
02:59:19,122 --> 02:59:27,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was member Russo, then member Kratz.

1855
02:59:29,849 --> 02:59:30,870
[SPEAKER_22]: I really had nothing to say.

1856
02:59:31,730 --> 02:59:32,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, member Kratz.

1857
02:59:34,952 --> 02:59:35,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on.

1858
02:59:36,645 --> 02:59:39,227
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just, sometimes I have to click it like five times.

1859
02:59:40,087 --> 02:59:41,088
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you unmute yourself?

1860
02:59:42,448 --> 02:59:45,010
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1861
02:59:45,150 --> 02:59:45,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1862
02:59:46,191 --> 02:59:46,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1863
02:59:46,491 --> 02:59:57,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to, you know, I was speaking with Melanie and I really appreciate all the email communications and updates from the superintendent and the mayor.

1864
02:59:58,238 --> 03:00:00,739
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been phenomenal, the updates and the emails.

1865
03:00:02,180 --> 03:00:04,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I do and did feel a little bit like,

1866
03:00:05,422 --> 03:00:13,386
[SPEAKER_09]: in the dark a little bit because we weren't actually meeting the same way that you were meeting with the administrators, let's say, and having like those Zoom calls.

1867
03:00:13,446 --> 03:00:21,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I do support having, you know, a meeting before the, you know,

1868
03:00:22,471 --> 03:00:30,337
[SPEAKER_09]: before we're supposed to go back to school, which is, you know, set to be May 4th, because with the coronavirus, you know, it's constantly changing.

1869
03:00:30,517 --> 03:00:44,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Even the president, he originally planned to want to have people to go back after Easter, but he made a decision after speaking with researchers that, you know, it wasn't in the best interest and for the safety of the Americans, citizens.

1870
03:00:44,926 --> 03:00:46,768
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like the

1871
03:00:47,408 --> 03:00:49,410
[SPEAKER_09]: the virus is changing every day.

1872
03:00:49,430 --> 03:00:51,171
[SPEAKER_09]: We just don't know what's going to happen.

1873
03:00:51,231 --> 03:01:05,944
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be a long stretch if we didn't have a meeting before, at least like, I mean, even if it was a special meeting, it doesn't have to be scheduled for three hours, but just a special meeting to catch up and, um,

1874
03:01:07,145 --> 03:01:14,630
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, talk about where we are and where's the coronavirus, how is it infecting Medford, things like that.

1875
03:01:15,070 --> 03:01:16,111
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my thinking.

1876
03:01:16,451 --> 03:01:20,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I do support having it the 20th if everybody else agrees with that.

1877
03:01:20,914 --> 03:01:27,559
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that, you know, we have to continuously monitor what's happening with this virus.

1878
03:01:28,279 --> 03:01:32,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And because it spreads very, very rapidly, it's very contagious.

1879
03:01:33,963 --> 03:01:34,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just don't know.

1880
03:01:36,464 --> 03:01:36,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

1881
03:01:38,225 --> 03:01:41,066
[SPEAKER_18]: So it sounds like everybody's OK with the 20th.

1882
03:01:41,366 --> 03:01:42,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion, Member VandeKloot.

1883
03:01:43,386 --> 03:01:50,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just would like to ask the administrative people whether they're OK with the 20th as opposed to the 13th.

1884
03:01:50,949 --> 03:01:51,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we do a high five?

1885
03:01:51,909 --> 03:01:53,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we do a thumbs up if we're OK with the 20th?

1886

[SPEAKER_18]: Superintendent, Dr. Edouard Vincent.

1904
03:02:44,491 --> 03:02:48,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially for the subcommittee meetings, I had just wanted the school committee to

1905
03:02:49,735 --> 03:03:05,925
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the schedule of meetings that were there, if the individual chairs would reach out to me so that I could at least try to space the meetings out and ask from the members who they would like to have in attendance at those meetings.

1906
03:03:06,745 --> 03:03:12,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I can work on that schedule with the individual chairs of the subcommittee meetings.

1907
03:03:15,130 --> 03:03:15,710
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

1908
03:03:17,271 --> 03:03:17,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1909
03:03:18,990 --> 03:03:19,370
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1910
03:03:19,490 --> 03:03:20,490
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a motion?

1911
03:03:20,810 --> 03:03:22,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, everybody, for the hard work.

1912
03:03:22,651 --> 03:03:25,272
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it was a long meeting, but it was definitely needed.

1913
03:03:26,252 --> 03:03:27,612
[SPEAKER_18]: And I apologize it took so long.

1914
03:03:27,712 --> 03:03:32,533
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't get the Zoom accounts till last Monday.

1915
03:03:32,553 --> 03:03:37,074
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wasn't really trained on it until finalized training on Thursday.

1916
03:03:37,134 --> 03:03:38,275
[SPEAKER_18]: So it went really well.

1917
03:03:38,335 --> 03:03:40,155
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm glad we had so much participation.

1918
03:03:40,195 --> 03:03:41,456

1920
03:03:47,816 --> 03:03:50,277
[SPEAKER_18]: continue on and learn as much as they can.

1921
03:03:50,317 --> 03:03:52,638
[SPEAKER_18]: And we definitely take care of every child.

1922
03:03:52,718 --> 03:03:54,598
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you all for participating.

1923
03:03:54,678 --> 03:03:55,659

03:03:58,760 --> 03:04:02,841
[SPEAKER_18]: Please have your agenda items in by Wednesday, Dr. Maurice.

1926
03:04:06,242 --> 03:04:07,943
[SPEAKER_18]: What agenda items?

1927
03:04:09,352 --> 03:04:13,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am working on the list that we have.

1928
03:04:13,195 --> 03:04:22,642
[SPEAKER_03]: But because we have executive session, we will not have an extended regular list.

1929
03:04:22,682 --> 03:04:32,590
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're working on getting the responses to the spreadsheet and to some of the communications that came forward already with a lot of information.

1930
03:04:32,690 --> 03:04:36,813
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's right now all being gathered together.

1931
03:04:37,814 --> 03:04:38,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1932
03:04:39,147 --> 03:04:39,407
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1933
03:04:39,447 --> 03:04:40,308
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll see you Monday.

1934
03:04:40,348 --> 03:04:43,811
[SPEAKER_18]: Did we want to change the time or do you, how does everybody feel?

1935
03:04:43,851 --> 03:04:52,179
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you like the five o'clock now that we have time and then we can put our kids to bed or can I get a thumbs up or should we go five o'clock?

1936
03:04:52,279 --> 03:04:53,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody thumbs up for five.

1937
03:04:53,581 --> 03:04:55,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1938
03:04:56,303 --> 03:04:57,344
[SPEAKER_18]: Does anybody want seven?

1939
03:04:57,364 --> 03:04:59,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1940

[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to change the meeting to five made by

1941
03:05:03,173 --> 03:05:06,434
[SPEAKER_18]: make a motion to change the meeting?

1942
03:05:06,674 --> 03:05:12,875
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing is we're having the budget committee of the holes, which are 5.30 to 7.

1943
03:05:13,415 --> 03:05:17,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have the regular meeting following.

1944
03:05:17,296 --> 03:05:22,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So our school committee meetings are going to start at 5.30 PM.

1945
03:05:23,157 --> 03:05:27,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hoping we don't go until 10 and 11 PM, but they're going to start at 5.30.

1946
03:05:28,878 --> 03:05:30,038
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we want to start them at 4?

1947
03:05:30,278 --> 03:05:31,258
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's up to the

1948
03:05:31,763 --> 03:05:53,321
[SPEAKER_18]: this body obviously but do we want to start them a little bit earlier so we're not here till 10 or I don't know it's hard the computer is a lot harder than being in person I don't know between so I don't think we can go much longer than the three hours just for our eyes but it's up to the body do you want 530 fine or do you want to go a little bit earlier?

1949
03:05:56,029 --> 03:05:58,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I could go earlier if people could.

1950
03:05:58,571 --> 03:06:04,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I am working remotely from home, but I'm home, so I get out at three.

1951
03:06:04,134 --> 03:06:11,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be in a meeting as early as like 3.30 just to, you know, get something to eat and, you know, be ready if that works for everybody else.

1952
03:06:14,281 --> 03:06:19,305
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll unmute you all at this point if you wish to chime in.

1953
03:06:21,226 --> 03:06:22,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier.

1954
03:06:22,167 --> 03:06:22,427

1957
03:06:24,336 --> 03:06:29,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do as early as 3.30, but I could do 4, I guess.

1958
03:06:29,759 --> 03:06:29,859
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1959
03:06:29,879 --> 03:06:30,579
