And member grant present to present 1 absent and we'll be along in just a few.

15
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:16,628
Um, okay, so.

16
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:20,089
I put the, um.

17
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:33,172
The resolution at the bottom of the agenda just for reference, but I did some thinking, you know, I was doing some thinking about what we sort of said we wanted to to talk through and think about.

18
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:40,167
And what I was hoping we could do today is talk a little bit about, like, how would we put this into motion?

19
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:48,153
And in my mind, I see this sort of in 2 phases, which I think we talked a little bit about even in the.

20
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:50,598
Resolution that was sent to us.

21
00:01:50,638 --> 00:02:01,626
So the 1st phase, I think, is to really think about what the, like, how to engage the community and some of the conversation around strategic planning.

22
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:04,508
That's never been done in Medford before.

23
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:13,294
So, while we have had strategic plans in the past, they never have started with asking the community what the community wants their schools to look like.

24
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:13,494
So.

25
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:20,877
To me, that's like phase one and then, you know, phase two is like, okay, how do we, how do we make that happen?

26
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:25,198
Like, what is the action plan that takes us from where we are to where we want to be?

27
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:35,862
So I think, like, roughly what I was hoping to do today is talk a little bit about particularly that phase one and start to think about how we might do that.

28
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:40,904
I did put together a couple of things that we can talk about.

29
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:45,005
One, one is a survey that could go out

30
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:50,695
via email, and the other is an agenda for a series of focus groups.

31
00:02:50,715 --> 00:03:02,578
So we can get to both of those things, but I wanted to pause there and just find out if anybody had anything else they wanted to, like, immediately add to, like, the phase one public input part of the process.

32
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:08,480
Those feel like the right places to start.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,562
And I would just say there's a transition between one and two, which is to articulate the vision and mission.

34
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,702
Yeah, which the action plan leads to that.

35
00:03:19,462 --> 00:03:22,684
And I think that's embedded, but I wanted to call it out explicitly.

36
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,026
Yeah, I think so too.

37
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:26,867
And I think that

38
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:40,697
When we talk about asking the community, I think one of the things about the last strategic plan is it really largely didn't address the mission statement.

39
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:43,879
I went to pull it so that I could put it into this document.

40
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:51,082
I was like, wow, I hate that mission statement just as much now as I ever have because I don't think it resonates.

41
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:55,504
In my vision of what this all looks like when it's done,

42
00:03:56,634 --> 00:04:01,675
We as a community need to own the piece that says this is the kind of school system we want to show up for.

43
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:12,038
And then the superintendent and the team has to be able to say, if you want us to do that, this is how we will do that, and this is how we'll get there.

44
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:19,840
But it should be something that resonates with people and makes people think, yeah, I belong here.

45
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,621
And I don't think our current mission statement does that at all.

46
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:35,814
A while back when I was like, out trolling strategic plans, I happened upon, I think it was Lexington's and their strategic plan, like, led with, like.

47
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:42,603
their revolutionary spirit, and it was very Lexington.

48
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:50,329
The community jumped off the page at you in terms of how they perceived their schools.

49
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,872
And I don't think it's impossible for us to do the same thing.

50
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:59,616
We've never really asked the community these questions, so that's the first step.

51
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:01,858
But I do think

52
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:11,341
Um, you know, sort of focusing some of this public input work on the mission statement, I think could really help frame, like, where are we trying to go?

53
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:16,963
And I think we have, like, so many wildly creative people in our community that.

54
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:31,178
you know, we're not probably going to say it's our revolutionary spirit because that's not who Medford is, but like, there's, there's somebody out there with like the clever, catchy way to help people feel like they belong here.

55
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:35,821
If we can provide like the right, the right sort of source material.

56
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:36,141
Right.

57
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:47,688
So that was like sort of one thing that came to my mind as I was thinking about this phase one is like the output, like I, I do want the output to be,

58
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,331
compelling and to make people feel like they want to be part of this district.

59
00:05:54,391 --> 00:06:03,494
So that when somebody is like looking to buy a house in Medford and they happen upon the website and they read this, they're like, yeah, that's where I want to send my kid.

60
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:09,535
Um, and I, you know, our current, uh, mission statement certainly does not jump off the page like that.

61
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:14,216
So I think there's like, to me, there's a couple of pieces there's like, what is our mission?

62
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:16,797
And then I think the other part is like,

63
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:23,385
And what would have to happen in the minds of the community for us to say, like, we have arrived at that mission, right?

64
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,045
Like, how do we get there?

65
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:29,587
And what are the most pressing things that the community thinks we should be responding to?

66
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:32,329
So those were sort of two things on my mind.

67
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:40,732
The other thing on my mind was, like, how do we move quickly through this phase?

68
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:46,575
I think what I feel from the community is, like, people are interested in action.

69
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:52,508
and impatient when we're in the exploratory stages of things, understandably.

70
00:06:52,669 --> 00:07:05,957
So how do we put a sequence of events together and a timeline that then allows us to really come to some of these answers before too long?

71
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:12,201
And that would line up then to all the other things that this sets off from a strategic planning perspective.

72
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:25,915
1 question I did have, though, I think superintendent, you did a series of entry sessions when you took over as the superintendent and.

73
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:31,407
I don't think we've heard, like, what those results were yet.

74
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:37,531
And I was just, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that process and maybe some of the things you heard.

75
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:45,115
And I don't know if maybe asking you to, like, put that on the upcoming agenda so that this, like, these things pair off together makes sense.

76
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:49,858
But I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about that, because obviously I don't want to.

77
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,144
We don't want to keep doing the same thing over and over.

78
00:07:54,865 --> 00:08:00,989
But it would be helpful to know sort of what those were, because I personally wasn't able to attend any of them.

79
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,550
So.

80
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:05,993
No, that absolutely is fair.

81
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:09,235
I actually have it on for the agenda for Monday.

82
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,776
Perfect.

83
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:12,657
Coming Monday on the 20th.

84
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:16,540
And absolutely, it's overdue.

85
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,362
So I had.

86
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:31,035
over about 30 listening sessions across the district at each relative school, as well as some Zoom sessions.

87
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:37,241
There were survey and input also provided, so I will be kind of

88
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:45,324
detailing some of those broad themes that I heard through all of those sessions.

89
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:59,228
But I also want to be mindful, I think, in this process, one of the things that you'll see in my presentation is I do kind of have a slide about what voices are missing.

90
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:01,629
And I would say that it

91
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:12,642
One of the pieces that I really would like to see this process get to is it did not capture all the voices that make up Medford.

92
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:23,373
And so when we get to that phase two, I think it would be really important to have some of these sessions in the community and not at schools.

93
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:25,476
I do want to be mindful of

94
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:48,584
the place in which we're living and that it also may not be comfortable for people to come out at night to places that aren't schools or aren't safe places but I very much would think that I would like the conversation to also be are there spaces in

95
00:09:51,698 --> 00:10:04,243
places of worship or places that families are living, common rooms or common areas that we could hold some of these sessions so that we're getting a greater view and a greater voice.

96
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:11,850
I can kind of go through some of the pieces that I will be sharing about on Monday.

97
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:22,452
But to me, I really wanted to kind of target in on like the stakeholders and how we're going to try and get as many voices as we possibly can.

98
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:24,833
And I would say that that also includes students.

99
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:29,746
especially our secondary students.

100
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:40,049
I'm sure I don't, we haven't really talked about who we would be targeting with the survey, but I think student voice is another one to be captured.

101
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:52,833
Do you envision Medford community input from people not directly involved in the school system or hypothetically involved in the school system?

102
00:10:54,964 --> 00:11:15,814
I would say, especially right now, since we are in the process, the MSBA process, in building a new high school, and that is an entire community endeavor, especially for our flagship, and the spaces that are encompassed within what those plans look like for the new high school around our early childhood center.

103
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:19,336
We have our pool and our fields.

104
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:22,478
I would say very much that

105
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:28,711
Part of that is all woven into the importance of where we stand right now in that process.

106
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,057
And that's for the entire community.

107
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:33,209
Yes.

108
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:44,877
I also think that there's a subset of, I see the non-parent caregivers, but of parents slash caregivers who have chosen for whatever reason, not to send their children to Medford public schools.

109
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:50,921
Some of hearing that feedback of what some of them were in Medford public schools and now are not.

110
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:56,945
And some of them never were in the district in Medford public schools.

111
00:11:58,106 --> 00:11:58,266
Yeah.

112
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:11,391
to the point of looking to have people who are joining the Medford community broadly see the schools as a place for them?

113
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:11,391
100%.

114
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:26,218
Data of any kind about students that are not in MPS.

115
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:28,779
Like, do we have census data about where

116
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:38,748
like how could we invite students that aren't in our row or caregivers?

117
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:51,193
We do have census data and we also have data that we have to provide the Department of Education around Medford residents that do not attend Medford public schools.

118
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:57,276
And so we do have some data as to where those students are attending in the students attending report.

119
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:05,147
And could we, do we have contact information for those families or do we just know where they go to school?

120
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:13,871
We just know where they go to school, but I think we would need to work with some of our community partners.

121
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:26,696
And does that usually go well or and cooperatively or not?

122
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,683
I know I've never tried to do that kind of outreach before, so I just wasn't sure.

123
00:13:34,703 --> 00:13:38,546
I only kind of have the anecdotal when I encounter people.

124
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:48,592
Yeah, and to be fair, and to clarify for anybody listening, the report, we are not reaching out to families.

125
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:51,994
We're reaching out to the schools and the institutions that the students attend.

126
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,800
that's where we're getting the data, so.

127
00:13:57,441 --> 00:14:11,681
And I think it may be part of the non-parent caregivers outreach, if it's Medford, the Medford community more broadly, I think it might just be messaging of, we want to hear from you whether or not you have kids in Medford public schools.

128
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,202
Also, I think that first bullet point should be community spaces that are not schools.

129
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:32,424
Can just see us looking back at those notes going, what did, what did we say that?

130
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:33,144
Yeah.

131
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:34,744
Okay.

132
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:44,787
So.

133
00:14:46,287 --> 00:14:47,348
We do have.

134
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:55,758
You know, I think the question about, like, making sure all the voices are heard is an important one.

135
00:14:55,778 --> 00:15:11,467
And I think we have, like, our normal ways where we, like, if we're talking about a survey, right, like, we have our normal ways that we are going to push out a survey, and that's going to generate, like, a body of response.

136
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:25,977
I'm wondering if, like, in addition to how we would normally push those things out, like, either from the superintendent's office, or even from the principles, like, are there other targeted ways that we need to reach families?

137
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:26,878
Is there like.

138
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:30,193
messaging that comes from our EL department?

139
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:32,495
Is there messaging that comes from our special ed department?

140
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,497
Is there messaging that comes from our athletics department?

141
00:15:34,537 --> 00:15:47,970
Like, are there other places that have, like, lots of touch points with families that we would want to say, like, we need you also to push this out so that we can collect additional information?

142
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:58,733
And do we, you know, at the elementary level, do we, like, you know, stuff backpacks with flyers?

143
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:01,175
That doesn't work in middle school or high school.

144
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:04,958
But, you know, I think that's sort of the, like, the reach question.

145
00:16:04,978 --> 00:16:09,942
I don't know that we've ever really solved, like, how do we get to those families that we don't hear from so much?

146
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:15,267
And I don't know if you have any thoughts or suggestions about that that we need to be planning for.

147
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:23,175
I would jump in and say the community liaisons in City Hall have some connection there.

148
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:33,878
And I know they've been developing partnerships with a couple of the elementary schools with McGlynn and Missituck.

149
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:39,040
So I was just going to say that member Reinfeldt, they are wonderful.

150
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:46,752
And in addition, I think some of the PTOs, a lot of them have their own newsletters.

151
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:57,501
And so I think if we're including links in multiple principal newsletters, as well as PTO newsletters, and I think we do have platforms.

152
00:16:59,122 --> 00:17:05,206
Like when I think of talking points, that is very helpful for some families because it's like a direct link.

153
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:18,134
Not every caregiver has email, but they do, can receive notifications and even the direct links to the surveys and the newsletters via text.

154
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:23,157
So I think using that platform would be helpful as well.

155
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:25,018
And I know Will,

156
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:30,469
is here and can probably speak to a lot of the other avenues.

157
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:38,335
But I would say the additional messaging from some of the departments that Ms.

158
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,976
McNiff can give for EL and Ms.

159
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:44,179
Bowen can give for special education is helpful.

160
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:51,444
Just any additional layer of context for their families is, I think, helpful.

161
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:59,633
I don't know if you wanted to add anything on, Will, for other avenues that I may not have mentioned.

162
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:08,217
No, I mean, I just think trying to meet people where they are when we're trying to talk about the big picture about the schools, I think, is always a good idea.

163
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:39,028
I think if we kind of do some of the ways we do kind of on a consistent basis, we get a lot of the voices that we may have either already heard from or we have heard from a lot throughout the last few kind of weeks and months, but finding new ways, whether it's even just putting like a quick QR code up in like a local business and just saying like Manitoba Public Schools wants to hear from you, like tell us your thoughts and just typing into the communities like someone mentioned earlier, whether it's

164
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:47,052
The athletics or the arts and just kind of already those built in spaces that have that consistent dialogue throughout the school year.

165
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:21,160
And it's been a while now, but we did some Zoom focus groups.

166
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:24,001
What was that?

167
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:25,121
I think it was like 21.

168
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,001
COVID?

169
00:19:26,502 --> 00:19:27,782
Yeah, it was like 21.

170
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:28,862
There were the COVID ones.

171
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:29,723
Right.

172
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:37,245
And I do remember that we had

173
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:47,486
And we had interpreters join us for those meetings to support families.

174
00:19:47,526 --> 00:19:55,887
And we actually did have a number of people join us who were able to, like, make use of the interpreter services.

175
00:19:57,008 --> 00:20:04,569
And to your point about safety, I do think we probably need to think about a multi-pronged approach.

176
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:07,990
Like, we need to give people the option to come to a Zoom session.

177
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:15,739
And I think we need to give people an option to come, like, whether it's 1 in every school building or.

178
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:24,143
In community spaces, or on zoom, like, I think there do need to be, like, any number of.

179
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:29,546
Sessions, but I, I was also sort of thinking about.

180
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:35,449
Um, whether, like, the meetings and the meetings.

181
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:59,321
if there is a way to, like, sort of use one of their standing times where they have sort of the attention of their respective communities to be able to, you know, hold and host some in-person sessions as well.

182
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:00,782
Absolutely.

183
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:02,432
Absolutely.

184
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:12,419
I was able to do that for CPAC, LPAC just in recent months.

185
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,341
I think that's a little bit more of a challenge.

186
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:17,743
I can speak with Director McNiff, but I think

187
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:21,565
there's a lot of reservations right now.

188
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:24,527
And so I can touch base with her.

189
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:37,095
And I think what we have just seen in the past couple months is that some direct outreach has been more successful than scheduled meetings.

190
00:21:41,998 --> 00:21:47,402
I think 100% with their monthly meetings, I don't think that that would be

191
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:50,486
a problem with some pre-planning at all.

192
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:56,550
I'm also going to put MFN, Medford Family Network, on this list.

193
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:04,995
Yeah, I remember so.

194
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:10,439
Hello, my apologies for being late.

195
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:11,979
That's okay.

196
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,761
I'm also going to be in the car for the little bit.

197
00:22:15,762 --> 00:22:15,982
Okay.

198
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:24,626
We tried to convince him to just come to our meeting, but he's the chair at the shore.

199
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,947
So they needed him more than we needed him.

200
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:29,989
Judy calls.

201
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,771
Um, okay.

202
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:46,496
So I, with the help of a friend, um, did put together some potential questions we might ask in a written survey.

203
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:48,837
I don't know if you, if, um,

204
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,371
We wanna take a look at that.

205
00:22:51,571 --> 00:23:11,002
What I'm sort of envisioning in terms of like the report out of this is to be able to say to the school committee, we wanna do a survey and it looks like this and we wanna do these sessions and the sessions look like this and we're working on the schedule and we want you to participate with us to help facilitate these things and we'll show you how to do that.

206
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:16,765
And we'll get the schedule put in place and then we'll release like a

207
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:20,979
A list of opportunities to come join us at these things.

208
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:29,911
Yeah, and that my question was around actually, my question was, if we need an outside facilitator on any of this.

209
00:23:32,796 --> 00:23:36,977
I think we can script it in a way that we don't.

210
00:23:38,338 --> 00:23:51,164
And I actually went back to, I hopped in my time machine from before I was on the school committee, and we held sessions like this right as I was taking office.

211
00:23:51,184 --> 00:23:55,126
It was part of the transition planning from the mayor's office.

212
00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:57,587
And we held a session at the McGlynn.

213
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:01,731
And I went and found that report and at the end of the report.

214
00:24:04,425 --> 00:24:08,148
there was like a page about like, here's what people said about the session.

215
00:24:08,328 --> 00:24:11,731
And one of the comments was like, please do more of this.

216
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:18,136
So it was really well-received and I thought people were really excited and energized about it.

217
00:24:18,276 --> 00:24:25,002
So I think if we follow that same kind of model, I don't think we have to have an outside facilitator.

218
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:29,365
And I think outside facilitators

219
00:24:30,373 --> 00:24:45,818
can be very useful, but I think in the context of, like, the community telling us, like, what kind of schools they want to have, like, that is a community conversation, and I think we could manage it just fine without that, but.

220
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:57,522
I would say that feedback came up in every single session I had with staff and caregivers, that they very much like to have a forum of discussion.

221
00:24:58,643 --> 00:24:58,823
Yeah.

222
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:03,147
So, we want to look at the survey 1st.

223
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:13,696
Yes, and I think I think to be really clear that this is about setting the direction and future looking because.

224
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:19,941
To the, I mean, I think there's a, I saw there's a question about what's not working well, and that's.

225
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:26,557
really important, but making sure people feel safe in providing criticism.

226
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:36,605
I know sometimes people don't feel comfortable talking to the implementers of things, but I think particularly if we can have paired facilitation.

227
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:47,774
And I think, you know, when we figure out how these groups get organized, we certainly

228
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,078
we could take the approach that we want.

229
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:56,697
like, just the school committee to participate in the, like, facilitation role.

230
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:11,549
We could take the approach that we want to just pair, like, we want there to be some pairing off of people so that we don't have administrators on their own without somebody from the school committee.

231
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:20,197
And we may, there just may be topics where we say, like, administrators not on these topics so that people feel

232
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,897
Like, they can speak up, like, I've had people say to me, oh, I wanted to say something about this thing, but.

233
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:39,053
I, like, I, I just can't, because I would have to say to this person, and I have too many other things happening with that person right then, you know, right in this moment to, like, add something to the.

234
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:42,175
conversation, you know, with that person.

235
00:26:42,315 --> 00:26:52,737
So, you know, we can try to, like, protect those, like, more controversial topics as well if we feel like that is necessary once we look at the agenda.

236
00:26:56,838 --> 00:26:57,138
Okay.

237
00:26:57,238 --> 00:27:02,099
So I will show you, and I, can you see my screen okay?

238
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,060
Paul, I know you can't see it, but.

239
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,100
What was the question?

240
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,701
Can you see my screen?

241
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:09,341
I can.

242
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:12,540
Okay, perfect and if I don't look at the road, I can read it.

243
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:13,341
Okay.

244
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,222
Well, do that.

245
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:15,223
Don't do that.

246
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:19,606
So I did make a comment because we.

247
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:24,691
When we did the superintendent search committee.

248
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:29,786
I remember it vividly.

249
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:36,214
Okay, we did take the time to get the demographic questions, right?

250
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,898
And it was the source of much discussion.

251
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:41,920
Yes, I have all that still.

252
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,881
Okay, great.

253
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:44,643
Because I was like, I'm not going to go like.

254
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:49,790
that far back in my time machine to try to dig up those documents.

255
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:55,334
But I think there are some demographic questions so that we can say, are we there yet?

256
00:27:55,754 --> 00:28:02,158
Are we getting feedback that is consistent with who Medford really is?

257
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:06,781
And with the superintendent search, the answer was no.

258
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,802
Not even close.

259
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:09,843
It was a big old no.

260
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:11,784
I saw that data as well.

261
00:28:11,944 --> 00:28:12,785
It was not.

262
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:13,946
Yeah.

263
00:28:14,346 --> 00:28:15,166
It was a big old no.

264
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:26,570
I, I am hopeful that this would maybe be a little different and many years have passed since that happened.

265
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:32,357
And we do a lot of surveying now, like, we, as a.

266
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:35,220
you know, society, we do a lot of that now.

267
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:39,223
And certainly as a district, we, we do more of that.

268
00:28:39,263 --> 00:28:49,913
So at least that can give us directionally, like, who are we missing so that we can then do some like successive outreach if we need to, which I expect that we will.

269
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:51,734
Okay.

270
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:52,415
Yeah.

271
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:53,576
Sorry, member Graham.

272
00:28:53,976 --> 00:28:55,237
Yeah.

273
00:28:55,638 --> 00:29:00,742
You know, and also like, unlike with the superintendent search where we, you know, we had like,

274
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:10,615
a deadline and an urgency that was immovable, taking the time to find and get community input is something I think we can do here.

275
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:12,697
I agree.

276
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:25,265
So in addition to the demographic information, question one I asked was, what is your connection to Medford Public Schools?

277
00:29:25,585 --> 00:29:29,408
So parent or guardian, student, staff member, community member,

278
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:34,434
And question number two, what school or schools are you affiliated with?

279
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:48,704
So I think we can like add to this list here, but just trying to like orient so that we are particularly hearing from students, community members, et cetera.

280
00:29:48,724 --> 00:29:52,467
I think you have to define, sorry, go ahead, Paul.

281
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:55,889
Nevermind, I could, I took a moment to read and I got my answer.

282
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:59,472
I think community member is too vague.

283
00:30:01,112 --> 00:30:03,657
Is this a Medford school community member somehow?

284
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:08,207
Is this a Medford resident?

285
00:30:08,227 --> 00:30:11,333
Yeah, I would change it to just like Medford resident.

286
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:41,018
You may also want a field for, we may want alumni, alumna, alum.

287
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,901
Whatever that plural or singular is.

288
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:51,804
I use alum because I don't like the gendered Latin, but.

289
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,008
What are we missing?

290
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:10,353
We won't ding you on the formatting, it's Microsoft Word.

291
00:31:15,077 --> 00:31:19,661
I'll fix it, but I'm like, why does everything move around so badly?

292
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:20,362
Anyway.

293
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:24,725
Okay, and what schools are you affiliated with?

294
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:35,014
We would obviously have all of our schools listed so that if we're triangulating and we're getting lots of feedback from one school community and not others, we know how to target.

295
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:40,726
And we're not, I don't know that, I think we're covered with student outside of NPS.

296
00:31:40,746 --> 00:31:51,093
Do we want to know if somebody's at a charter school or a parochial school or a private school for those non-NPS schools?

297
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:53,175
Is that relevant data?

298
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:55,057
I think it is.

299
00:31:55,817 --> 00:31:56,257
I think it is.

300
00:31:56,297 --> 00:32:02,062
I would just put other in a place for people to write it in instead of us trying to divine that lengthy list.

301
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:11,809
And to remember Reinfeld's point before, you also could have MFN, some affiliation with MFN that's not in our schools yet.

302
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:16,275
Oh, yes.

303
00:32:16,555 --> 00:32:17,496
Future MPS.

304
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:17,957
Future.

305
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:43,473
So the next section, the way I drafted this survey was to try to warm people up to the questions about the mission statement.

306
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:49,939
Because I think if you just go in cold on a mission statement, it's really hard for people to tell you what they like about it.

307
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:58,420
Sort of in the reverse of the way I would do it in person, but or, like, from the top to the bottom, but.

308
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:04,026
You know, what are the top 3 priorities you believe the district should focus on over the next 5 years?

309
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:09,892
Some questions about how important different things are to people and then.

310
00:33:11,884 --> 00:33:16,771
in Section 3, what's working well, what needs improvement, what other thoughts do you want to share?

311
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:21,697
So I'll stop there and ask for any questions, comments, etc.

312
00:33:41,432 --> 00:33:56,376
I'm trying to think if it's if there's out of school time, if if that's too broad, because it covers athletics and arts, which also happens in the schools and after school care and and.

313
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:04,898
And how granular.

314
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:12,965
you know, is academic excellence, do we need to get into literacy and STEM and, and?

315
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:26,968
Well, my thoughts on that are that, you know, different people will come at these questions from different backgrounds of knowledge.

316
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:36,570
And so, and different points of what's the word I'm looking for different locus of

317
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:41,980
control, not control, but power, whatever the right word is.

318
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:50,564
So, you know, I think that some people might come at it and be like, obviously, academic excellence, that's the entire point of school to some people.

319
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:55,667
And we want to allow them to express that.

320
00:34:56,647 --> 00:35:03,070
And then other people are going to be from, you know, their own experience of special ed or literacy, and going to be like, this is the thing.

321
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:14,045
And so I think it's going to be hard for us to get the questions so that we don't get such a broad set of answers.

322
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:15,206
I think that's going to be challenging.

323
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:19,328
I think in the analysis afterwards, that's going to be a huge lift.

324
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:28,813
Yeah, I'm wondering if there is a starting point here of these are the things

325
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:40,160
Unfortunately, I don't think we can look at the past strategic plans to say these are the things that have been prioritized in Medford schools.

326
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:43,203
How important are these things to you and what's missing?

327
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:47,486
But I want some kind of grounding.

328
00:35:47,506 --> 00:35:52,531
The other thing that I went back and forth about when I was

329
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:56,253
trying to pull this together just so we had something to talk about.

330
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,314
Was this like rate on a scale of one to five?

331
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:02,416
Like you could just say five, everything's important.

332
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:18,506
And that actually, it tells us something, but would it tell us more if we ask people to like, tell us in order of importance how this list shakes out?

333
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:19,206
Yeah.

334
00:36:19,907 --> 00:36:20,087
Yeah.

335
00:36:20,187 --> 00:36:21,648
Or, or, or make them,

336
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:48,917
pick a top five and not pick the rest because people will you know that everybody picking five for something like the the problem is is that different people will approach that from different with different methodologies and I think the results will then be kind of useless in a way um so you know here's the 20 options what are your top five makes them

337
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:57,434
even if they were going to say they're all their number ones, it makes them decide what's the most important for them.

338
00:36:57,594 --> 00:37:02,596
And then that in aggregate across the other people filling out the survey will start to have meaning.

339
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:10,900
Way to tier things to say this is a top priority, this is a, sorry, Will.

340
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:19,697
No, I was just going to say some of the surveys we've done while we've looked to hire new administrators is we've kind of listed things like this and said, select your top 3.

341
00:37:22,013 --> 00:37:38,796
And then people can kind of choose more than 3 if they want to, like, on a Google form, especially, and that was really impactful data that really narrowed, like, as then we would bring the discussions to some of the committee members and be like, this is what the community is kind of prioritizing in this process.

342
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:42,617
So, that's that's just something that we found, especially to serve it.

343
00:37:42,717 --> 00:37:48,098
The committees that I served on, it was pretty helpful to at least start the conversation that way.

344
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:49,738
Okay.

345
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:53,195
And the question before this is what are your top three, right?

346
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:55,616
Or maybe that's the second question.

347
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:55,816
Yeah.

348
00:37:56,477 --> 00:37:56,717
Yeah.

349
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:06,063
I would say a lot of this overlaps with the data that I will be presenting on Monday.

350
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:16,130
The only one that really stands out to me as like a continuous theme that's not explicitly called out here is just communication overall.

351
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:19,192
Communication, communication methods,

352
00:38:26,802 --> 00:38:27,363
Okay.

353
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:32,586
And then.

354
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:41,606
The Section 4 is sort of my attempt to start to, like, open people up around the mission statement.

355
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:45,567
I had to, like, go find it because I was like, nobody's going to know what it is.

356
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,769
So that—so I put that in here.

357
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:52,730
And the first question is, are you familiar—do you know about this?

358
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,391
Like, was today the first day you learned about our mission statement?

359
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:57,772
Because that says—that says something right there.

360
00:38:59,653 --> 00:39:02,336
The next question, do you connect with this mission statement?

361
00:39:02,396 --> 00:39:04,178
Does it speak to you in a positive way?

362
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:08,624
In your own words, what does this mission statement mean to you?

363
00:39:08,644 --> 00:39:14,711
And the mission statement reflects the kind of school I want to send my children slash the children of Medford to.

364
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:20,277
Like an agree, strongly agree kind of

365
00:39:22,378 --> 00:39:22,978
situation.

366
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:30,502
So that was just like me trying to and then what suggestions do you have for improving or updating the mission statement?

367
00:39:32,123 --> 00:39:41,528
So that was sort of my attempt to like pick at like, like starting to open up like, this doesn't resonate with me at all.

368
00:39:41,688 --> 00:39:45,110
Maybe that's just me and everyone else is like, Jenny, this is fine.

369
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,392
And we don't need to be revolutionary in our spirit or in our mission statement.

370
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,973
And if that's the case, then maybe that's the case.

371
00:39:51,073 --> 00:39:51,213
But

372
00:39:54,808 --> 00:40:05,331
I would just sort of be interested in starting to pick at, like, how people, like, react to this as an input to the series of sessions we want to hold.

373
00:40:08,932 --> 00:40:14,533
Yeah, so this feels like slightly too many questions about this statement that we think we're going to be rewriting.

374
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:25,842
I think interrogating it is a good thing, but I'm wondering if it's similar to the last bit.

375
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:28,643
What about this statement resonates with you?

376
00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:30,804
Where is it lacking?

377
00:40:30,824 --> 00:40:40,129
I know you're not asking me, but the 21st century education thing has got to go.

378
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:45,772
And this mission state, I do like that reflects the kind of school I want to send

379
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:55,240
It could also be this strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree.

380
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:03,685
And, oh, I lost the follow on to that.

381
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:08,928
Send my children to, I have to come back to that, sorry.

382
00:41:09,128 --> 00:41:10,989
Someone else was talking, so go ahead.

383
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:16,552
So I was thinking like maybe we could remove this question

384
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,303
this current number 10, so what does this mission statement mean to you?

385
00:41:25,323 --> 00:41:29,086
And just say, do you know about it?

386
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,110
Does this speak to you in a positive way?

387
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,312
And maybe we don't need that question.

388
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:40,737
This mission statement reflects the kind of school I want to send my children to, and what suggestions do you have?

389
00:41:40,777 --> 00:41:42,179
It could be just that simple.

390
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:46,803
Where's the cell phone on my page?

391
00:41:57,135 --> 00:42:00,057
Do we care if people are familiar with this statement?

392
00:42:01,378 --> 00:42:05,401
That speaks to how well we've communicated it out or not.

393
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:10,365
I'm not sure that feels like a looking back question.

394
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,132
Can you tell me more about why that was important to ask?

395
00:42:21,674 --> 00:42:22,415
I guess for me,

396
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:31,745
You don't want to assume that, like, maybe it's just like, no, I've never heard of this, but it sounds good.

397
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:32,246
I like it.

398
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:34,207
Even the 21st century part, right?

399
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:39,229
Like, versus, oh, yeah, I see that on the walls of the high school and I roll my eyes every time.

400
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:47,613
Like, those are two different, like, ways to, like, come at, like, familiarity, right?

401
00:42:47,673 --> 00:42:47,833
Like,

402
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:54,876
So I think it's just, and it's a yes, no, try to keep some of those questions super simple.

403
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:56,096
So it's like, don't overthink it.

404
00:42:56,697 --> 00:43:00,299
After you do or you don't, and then move along.

405
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:07,062
So that was my thinking when I put it together, but to other suggestions.

406
00:43:22,793 --> 00:43:25,554
The only thing I wonder about is maybe like the format of it, too.

407
00:43:27,295 --> 00:43:28,155
Are you familiar?

408
00:43:29,216 --> 00:43:30,036
Read through the whole thing?

409
00:43:30,056 --> 00:43:30,516
Yes, no.

410
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:34,778
I think some of that you're going to probably capture in nine.

411
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:37,599
Like in the following question.

412
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:51,227
I do think that the most, like just the data that is gonna be really important, that's gonna drive a lot of the work ahead would be what is now on this as 9, 11, and 12.

413
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:59,029
And I'm really hoping we get people to fill in 12.

414
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,711
Yeah.

415
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:05,432
Well, we could say,

416
00:44:06,473 --> 00:44:09,155
Something like we are considering.

417
00:44:32,595 --> 00:44:33,636
And then you could just

418
00:44:37,405 --> 00:44:42,407
That could be just like a statement that leads in to these three questions.

419
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:46,809
I think that's a bit cleaner.

420
00:44:48,330 --> 00:45:06,898
But something like suggested themes or items instead of suggestions or... Because that could give them a little... Instead of them trying to write a new mission,

421
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:12,734
with their ideas or adjustments or something like that.

422
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:35,185
Is the question for improving or is the question to say what would make you agree more strongly in question 11?

423
00:45:35,725 --> 00:45:36,666
Is it to say what,

424
00:45:38,762 --> 00:45:58,679
would you change about this mission statement for it to yeah what additional elements would make you feel more positive or something like that yeah well not even just i'm not looking for additions i also want you know i want to have them the pauls who say 21st century feels outdated that i don't this yeah

425
00:46:12,097 --> 00:46:14,301
I think we can tweak the wording a little bit but.

426
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:44,413
And please don't forget to hit save.

427
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,894
I don't know if you've done that or not.

428
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:54,738
Transcript, I think I'm on auto save, so OK, just good.

429
00:46:55,699 --> 00:46:56,599
We've all been burned.

430
00:47:00,982 --> 00:47:02,503
So I can clean this up and.

431
00:47:04,444 --> 00:47:10,067
Ask members so to add the demographic questions and.

432
00:47:11,585 --> 00:47:17,789
Um, would be happy to collect any other input once you see the cleaned up version, and then we can plan to share it on the agenda.

433
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:22,492
Um, for the committee to provide their input to on.

434
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:27,816
Monday, yeah, I think question 4 is going to need some cleaning up.

435
00:47:27,896 --> 00:47:28,256
I think.

436
00:47:28,496 --> 00:47:33,779
Yeah, we need to find the right balance between laundry list and.

437
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:38,282
Hitting all the vertical categories.

438
00:47:38,682 --> 00:47:38,863
Yeah.

439
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:39,343
Yeah.

440
00:47:52,945 --> 00:47:55,246
We'll take a crack at it and let you know.

441
00:47:55,266 --> 00:48:00,429
And I can think, although I guess open meeting law, we can't both.

442
00:48:05,612 --> 00:48:07,233
Is there anything that you're thinking about right now?

443
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:09,114
For this list?

444
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:12,016
Yeah.

445
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:23,339
What about belonging?

446
00:48:27,663 --> 00:48:28,845
Or some way to say that.

447
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:36,953
I love that.

448
00:48:36,973 --> 00:48:43,079
There's some signs around that have something to do with that.

449
00:48:55,176 --> 00:48:56,156
Is safety on there?

450
00:48:59,138 --> 00:49:00,078
Not explicitly.

451
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:03,520
Facilities and infrastructure are.

452
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,680
Yeah.

453
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:11,663
Yeah, but safety is both physical safety and correct emotional.

454
00:49:13,904 --> 00:49:15,745
Yeah, it's a hard one, because what do we mean?

455
00:49:15,765 --> 00:49:17,506
How do we interpret it?

456
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:35,285
Where does this particular data, what's going to happen with the feedback to this question?

457
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:39,547
Is this where our pillars and values come?

458
00:49:39,607 --> 00:49:41,427
Is this where our priorities come out?

459
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:45,269
Where are we trying to go with this question?

460
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:51,352
I think for me, it's an input.

461
00:49:53,612 --> 00:49:58,979
potentially to some of the in-person sessions just to aid in our preparation.

462
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,647
But also, not everybody's going to take the time to come to something in person.

463
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:11,415
And I want to give people the space to say, I'm not going to come to anything because I can't.

464
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:18,842
or I won't, or I don't want to, or I'm not comfortable, but I do wanna tell you that the single most important thing to me is this.

465
00:50:19,722 --> 00:50:24,244
And these things matter to me.

466
00:50:24,264 --> 00:50:27,785
I am paying attention even if I can't be physically present.

467
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:33,567
So it's sort of a way to give people a little bit of an opening to participate in this process.

468
00:50:38,448 --> 00:50:40,769
So the person I was just giving a ride home

469
00:50:42,279 --> 00:51:09,530
to, from my shore meeting, actually was a researcher in surveys and stuff, and she's not in the car anymore, but she did mention that having, whether it's, you know, gift cards or Medford swag, drawings, and then, you know, publicizing that each time we, you know, to, you know, Sarah S. from West Medford won this for filling out this survey.

470
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:19,703
that those things can drive responses quite heavily, even though it won't cost much.

471
00:51:20,103 --> 00:51:29,046
So that's just, I think, you know, I know like with the superintendent search, we, I think we didn't do that.

472
00:51:29,346 --> 00:51:38,469
And I think we relied heavily on, I don't wanna say guilt, but frankly that's, you know,

473
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:44,832
one interpretation of the, do you feel responsible to having input to this?

474
00:51:46,953 --> 00:51:55,977
And I worry about, and I think the results there kind of highlighted the inequitable use of that approach.

475
00:51:56,797 --> 00:52:06,902
So just a thought that I thought I should transmit because I don't know how much Bedford SWAG would cost, how many drawings we would do, but I think that if we could

476
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:14,985
do something like that that kind of is a hook to get people to fill it out, that might be helpful.

477
00:52:22,528 --> 00:52:30,651
Yeah, I was going to mention that that's what we do in surveys across

478
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,093
She also mentioned something else.

479
00:52:47,713 --> 00:52:59,636
Yeah, she mentioned something else that actually I didn't understand until just a second about, you know, getting people to fill it out early means they'll be in that drawing longer and have a better chance of winning.

480
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:05,997
So, you know, so that's just, I was a little confused when she said that, but now I understand.

481
00:53:09,117 --> 00:53:13,178
Every week we'll have five lucky winners, so register early.

482
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:15,914
for more chances to win.

483
00:53:44,327 --> 00:53:47,890
Okay, any other thoughts or questions?

484
00:53:48,110 --> 00:54:02,143
Yeah, so the thing that we haven't talked about yet that came up in in the resolution to prompt this meeting is questions around the leader, the district leadership to provide that basis for.

485
00:54:03,184 --> 00:54:15,977
appointments and the mandate for the person in the superintendent role to really feel guided by the community and supported by the community in that.

486
00:54:16,077 --> 00:54:19,761
So I'm not sure if that's coming up or if that's part of

487
00:54:21,062 --> 00:54:36,756
but we have tied this opportunity as a chance for the community to weigh in both on what the mission and milestones are for the district, but also for what they're looking for in district leadership.

488
00:54:44,684 --> 00:54:46,085
I think we would want to

489
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:53,980
Provide some context for the survey, right?

490
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,883
Include the presentation from the superintendent that she's going to share with us on Monday.

491
00:55:01,903 --> 00:55:18,788
And I will just note as you're typing that, right, some of this behind the resolution is in speaking with the Massachusetts Association of School Committees and talking about what happens when

492
00:55:20,368 --> 00:55:30,974
when appointments happen very quickly, as they did in this case, and being able to ground the work in a community process.

493
00:55:33,326 --> 00:55:49,450
And that this is often a good opportunity for the district to articulate values, which in our conversation, my conversation with our mask representative was saying, she said to me, well, when was the last time the community weighed in on this?

494
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,951
And I said, well, it's long overdue.

495
00:55:52,191 --> 00:55:55,652
And so being able to articulate that.

496
00:56:05,173 --> 00:56:16,918
And I will acknowledge the awkwardness of this conversation, given who is in the room right now, but I think it's really important to note that this is quite a bigger process.

497
00:56:18,038 --> 00:56:18,598
And quite fair.

498
00:56:18,618 --> 00:56:25,621
Erica, do you have thoughts on what those questions might be?

499
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:52,872
So what I'm trying to do is not, I want this, I want it to be forward looking and not necessarily what has worked and not worked in the past with leadership.

500
00:56:53,092 --> 00:56:53,513
And so,

501
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,380
I think.

502
00:56:59,701 --> 00:57:07,064
Some of it is similar to what we've done in our hiring of other leadership roles of right.

503
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:09,765
What are the things that are most important?

504
00:57:09,785 --> 00:57:15,867
The core if we as a district have these core values.

505
00:57:18,228 --> 00:57:20,329
This is what that looks like in practice.

506
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:20,709
This is.

507
00:57:23,512 --> 00:57:26,573
This is how I feel supported as a staff member.

508
00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:28,835
This is how I feel supported as a family.

509
00:57:28,855 --> 00:57:37,679
I think it's a little bit challenging because many people don't fully understand what the role is.

510
00:57:37,699 --> 00:57:38,219
But I think I do.

511
00:57:55,685 --> 00:58:03,527
want to know, the most upfront question is, what are you looking for in a leadership?

512
00:58:04,688 --> 00:58:09,309
Possibly these are the qualities that are most important to me.

513
00:58:09,329 --> 00:58:15,971
Can I jump in?

514
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:17,011
Please.

515
00:58:18,051 --> 00:58:24,513
So I really appreciate you got to where you did on this, because I was going to jump in and say, but most people don't know what these

516
00:58:25,372 --> 00:58:29,916
jobs are, even if you were to give the job description, they really don't know what they are.

517
00:58:29,936 --> 00:58:51,175
And, you know, one of the things that I am always uncomfortable with is, you know, it'd be like saying the teachers are the only ones who can hire the directors that they will work for, too, or the principals they'll work for.

518
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:57,262
or the only people who can hire the superintendent are the people who work for the superintendent.

519
00:58:57,522 --> 00:59:06,089
And because they're the only ones who will actually know what that person does day to day for real or what they want them to do.

520
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:14,315
And it's a lot like, what do you want in your primary care doctor versus what do you want in your surgeon?

521
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:20,340
And I want my primary care doctor to have exceptional bedside manners and to be passionate

522
00:59:20,773 --> 00:59:23,816
And I don't care if my surgeon is a psychopath.

523
00:59:24,596 --> 00:59:27,459
Are they a good surgeon is the only qualification.

524
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:44,013
So I think that's what makes me nervous about asking people, what do you want in this leader of this particular kind, considering the vast majority of the people at Medford will not be educators themselves.

525
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:48,096
I think the educators answering this question

526
00:59:48,712 --> 00:59:57,437
will have a very good and interesting set of answers, which I think are very worthy of culling and separating and being like, okay, this is what we're hearing from the educators.

527
00:59:57,457 --> 01:00:00,820
I think that is super meaningful.

528
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:13,467
And I think the non-educators, I'm not saying their opinion won't matter, but I think it has a different, I don't wanna say weighting, a different value, not more or less, just a different value.

529
01:00:13,487 --> 01:00:13,547
And,

530
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:19,619
you know, this is one of those things.

531
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:30,483
It's like, like the surgeon versus the primary care doctor, you know, like people might say they want to have a friendly surgeon, but it turns out they don't.

532
01:00:33,645 --> 01:00:39,407
So this is really a really hard area to nail down because also like,

533
01:00:40,717 --> 01:00:54,601
people's experiences with district leadership, whether as students or parents or employees in other places or with previous superintendents, will have a big effect, I think, on what they want.

534
01:00:55,061 --> 01:01:03,344
You know, when we had the gun clip thing, I remember Glenn Kuchar said, a third of the people are there for the reason that you're holding this event.

535
01:01:03,704 --> 01:01:09,746
A third are there to air grievances that may have nothing to do with anybody even in the room.

536
01:01:10,878 --> 01:01:27,462
And I don't want to repeat what he said the other third quarter for, but you know, I don't, our current superintendent, a future superintendent, like they're not the superintendents that the kids who have kids, the people who have kids in Medford now experienced.

537
01:01:29,883 --> 01:01:35,364
And so it's just very, very challenging for me to understand what we get in that regard.

538
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:40,365
That's useful because this is going to be a lot of data to

539
01:01:41,302 --> 01:01:48,463
not data, it's going to be qualitative stuff that has to be mulled over and understood and interpreted.

540
01:01:52,604 --> 01:02:04,346
I just pulled some questions with the help of co-pilot and no pride of authorship of any of these questions.

541
01:02:06,686 --> 01:02:08,027
But now we have something to react to.

542
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:10,147
So I'm curious what you think about these.

543
01:02:12,127 --> 01:02:22,234
And I was pulling up the last set of questions, which, you know, it was significant or current issues, which is actually what this is asking here.

544
01:02:22,254 --> 01:02:34,263
I feel a little on the fence about this question.

545
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:45,291
I'm not sure I want a bad answer to this question.

546
01:02:45,311 --> 01:02:47,913
I don't know.

547
01:02:47,993 --> 01:02:51,995
I just think it's important in the Medford community is the Medford community.

548
01:02:52,015 --> 01:02:54,636
Yeah, exactly.

549
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:57,678
We want someone who can work with the Medford community.

550
01:03:25,123 --> 01:03:27,964
About this number, so.

551
01:03:27,984 --> 01:03:32,926
Do you need us to read you the questions?

552
01:03:33,866 --> 01:03:35,866
No, I'm just sitting down in my home office.

553
01:03:37,367 --> 01:03:39,868
So I don't have a chance to see it yet, but give me a moment.

554
01:03:40,288 --> 01:03:40,448
Okay.

555
01:04:34,836 --> 01:04:39,479
I'm looking at the past that at the last Superintendent search.

556
01:04:39,499 --> 01:04:40,400
There's a question.

557
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:45,363
What are the strengths of the district that you want to see continued by the new Superintendent?

558
01:04:47,465 --> 01:04:51,588
I think that's a really strong question that taps into both of these.

559
01:04:52,769 --> 01:04:54,730
Points and potentially.

560
01:04:56,812 --> 01:04:57,392
What are the?

561
01:05:00,174 --> 01:05:01,295
What are the areas?

562
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:02,416
That.

563
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:27,825
you feel that the new superintendent most needs to address, although I think you've... And what are the most urgent areas for improvement?

564
01:05:29,605 --> 01:05:32,146
Maybe there might be a better phrasing than that, but...

565
01:05:34,505 --> 01:05:40,207
It's kind of a different version of what's most important to you.

566
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:54,374
I feel like this question is maybe a little too in the weeds, personally.

567
01:05:54,394 --> 01:05:58,835
It's fine.

568
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:02,377
It's sort of innocuous, but I don't think it

569
01:06:05,777 --> 01:06:07,778
Tells us so much.

570
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:12,442
I think to Dr. Galussi's point about communication being important.

571
01:06:15,124 --> 01:06:15,944
Good point.

572
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:20,468
I think this isn't quite the question, but I think it's a good point that.

573
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,273
I mean, it's a select all that apply, so.

574
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:29,390
I would agree.

575
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,971
That was the feedback.

576
01:06:32,592 --> 01:06:42,201
Just from the pieces that I heard, people like to have the options of the follow-up even to the regular correspondence via email.

577
01:06:42,381 --> 01:06:46,965
People really liked having the forum to be able to have discussion.

578
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,826
So I think it's important for data.

579
01:06:48,846 --> 01:06:54,131
Oh, there it is.

580
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:54,871
OK.

581
01:07:02,157 --> 01:07:05,499
Yeah, what was your question?

582
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:06,480
You had for me Jenny?

583
01:07:07,821 --> 01:07:08,321
Did you have it?

584
01:07:08,662 --> 01:07:10,343
Do you have any thoughts about these questions?

585
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,324
No, I think I mean.

586
01:07:13,685 --> 01:07:21,171
Question above the current question 1, I thought resolved my concern that nobody knew what the superintendent did.

587
01:07:21,911 --> 01:07:23,512
Um, because I, I think that that.

588
01:07:25,134 --> 01:07:26,995
It's not open ended, so I like, I like that.

589
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:42,733
And I would swap your second two and I would put strengths and urgent areas.

590
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,976
Back to back and put the communication after.

591
01:08:00,582 --> 01:08:01,742
To the point, is there another?

592
01:08:01,803 --> 01:08:04,224
Is there a specific question for educators?

593
01:08:05,528 --> 01:08:10,571
And it doesn't necessarily have to be a branching survey, but if you are an MPS educator.

594
01:08:11,071 --> 01:08:15,394
Because I do agree that's feedback that's really important.

595
01:08:15,434 --> 01:08:21,017
Well, I would expect that they would answer these two questions.

596
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:30,243
And then at the top, though, we're identifying what role they are when they're completing the survey.

597
01:08:33,457 --> 01:08:36,382
Yeah, and we said.

598
01:08:39,888 --> 01:08:41,691
Student staff member resident.

599
01:09:04,011 --> 01:09:10,198
Are there questions about that?

600
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:33,887
So, for the focus groups, just 1 more, I know member Russo, you're going to go back.

601
01:09:33,987 --> 01:09:35,612
You're going to pull the demographics.

602
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:36,133
Is that.

603
01:09:38,499 --> 01:09:46,505
This question of the graduate of Medford Public Schools, parent guardian at this school, that school, all the other schools, English.

604
01:09:46,785 --> 01:09:53,890
We also have had questions about parent guardian of a child in the English language learners receiving 504 accommodations.

605
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:54,731
Yeah, all of those.

606
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:55,471
All of those.

607
01:09:55,631 --> 01:10:01,616
Those are the demographics we're talking about, not the... Oh, you're muted.

608
01:10:04,758 --> 01:10:05,979
Well, can't you read lips?

609
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:06,719
Just kidding.

610
01:10:09,152 --> 01:10:10,493
I'm looking at them right now.

611
01:10:10,914 --> 01:10:15,538
And no, we don't ask those questions in the demographics.

612
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:23,645
I'm looking at the superintendent search demographics and it includes things like.

613
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:42,147
parent or guardian of a child receiving special education supports and services, 504, participating in athletic, yeah, there's a whole, this question six.

614
01:10:43,748 --> 01:10:46,650
I want to say it's from SurveyMonkey.

615
01:10:47,491 --> 01:10:50,392
The question six I have is your combined household income.

616
01:10:51,073 --> 01:10:51,333
Okay.

617
01:10:52,128 --> 01:10:54,589
I can send you this as well.

618
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:56,389
Can you just send those to me, and I will include them?

619
01:10:56,929 --> 01:11:03,451
Yeah, because it's got education professional, educator in Medford Public Schools, Medford residents with no children in Medford, anyway.

620
01:11:05,431 --> 01:11:07,112
Yeah, if you send those to me, I can add those in.

621
01:11:08,012 --> 01:11:08,312
OK.

622
01:11:12,193 --> 01:11:16,534
Yeah, I think I'm looking at just the straight demographics like the federal government would have.

623
01:11:18,434 --> 01:11:20,655
Yeah, and then I have this.

624
01:11:20,675 --> 01:11:21,315
What neighborhood?

625
01:11:25,103 --> 01:11:26,564
I am less concerned about that.

626
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:31,606
Yeah, there's a there are a bunch of demographics language you speak at home.

627
01:11:34,468 --> 01:11:35,408
How many children.

628
01:11:35,428 --> 01:11:40,411
I'm not sure we need this quite this level of detail.

629
01:11:41,732 --> 01:11:42,932
But, oh yeah, there's neighborhood.

630
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,714
These were based off of.

631
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:53,067
I think we should keep this because then we can use them to compare across other surveys we do.

632
01:11:53,848 --> 01:12:01,217
And these are best practice, at least at the time of writing this, which, you know.

633
01:12:01,998 --> 01:12:02,699
Yeah, this is from 2018.

634
01:12:17,128 --> 01:12:18,709
Great, I will send that after this meeting.

635
01:12:18,749 --> 01:12:19,429
Let's keep moving.

636
01:12:24,312 --> 01:12:24,932
Okay.

637
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:31,596
Okay, so I also put together an agenda.

638
01:12:34,338 --> 01:12:36,679
It's a 2 hour session.

639
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:44,824
And I can sort of walk you through it at a high level.

640
01:12:44,844 --> 01:12:45,404
So we're to, like.

641
01:12:46,425 --> 01:12:59,334
wordsmith every like little piece of this, but essentially, um, we would welcome people and we would use, you know, we would kick it off and give some, um, some framing, right?

642
01:12:59,374 --> 01:13:01,235
Like this is part of a multi-phase process.

643
01:13:01,856 --> 01:13:05,658
We want to focus first on what we want our district to look like and what our goals are.

644
01:13:06,058 --> 01:13:12,743
And then we'll, you know, talk about, um, you know, how we will like make progress towards those goals.

645
01:13:13,984 --> 01:13:14,044
Um,

646
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:25,845
We'll introduce the facilitation team, whoever that is, and we'll spend some time talking about the mission statement.

647
01:13:25,865 --> 01:13:28,647
So we'll talk about, like, here's the mission statement.

648
01:13:30,608 --> 01:13:31,609
Tell us what you think about it.

649
01:13:32,009 --> 01:13:34,790
Like, what are your reactions to the mission statement?

650
01:13:35,671 --> 01:13:41,634
And we will ask people to, like, write down their thoughts on stickies, and we'll have people in groups.

651
01:13:42,354 --> 01:13:45,016
They'll write down their thoughts, and we'll, like, organize, like,

652
01:13:46,052 --> 01:13:47,053
What are the positive thoughts?

653
01:13:47,093 --> 01:13:48,113
What are the negative thoughts?

654
01:13:48,274 --> 01:14:01,843
And then we will have people work in small groups to say, like, go ahead and discuss and, like, tell us what a compelling mission statement would sound like to you.

655
01:14:01,903 --> 01:14:05,946
So we start to generate some, like, creativity and some ideas and that kind of thing.

656
01:14:09,137 --> 01:14:16,279
Distinguishing between mission statement and vision statement, I just do notice that a lot of the other district strategic plans kind of have both.

657
01:14:16,459 --> 01:14:21,940
I think the vision comes out of the conversation and the mission is more of a respond to, but.

658
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:30,782
Yeah, I think those are like, I always find it hard to keep people in 1 bucket or the other.

659
01:14:32,487 --> 01:14:35,588
And I think the answer is both of those things are going to happen at the same time.

660
01:14:35,649 --> 01:14:36,729
And that's OK.

661
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:43,191
You can sort of collect all that information and then be like, OK, now what part of this is the mission?

662
01:14:43,231 --> 01:14:44,452
What part of this is the vision?

663
01:14:45,612 --> 01:14:58,377
But being sort of pressed for time, you would have to sort of have the time to step people through what goes where if you wanted to get to that level of detail, which I felt like we're

664
01:15:00,047 --> 01:15:03,870
It's pretty packed as it is with two hours.

665
01:15:06,431 --> 01:15:21,021
So then we'll switch gears and we'll ask everybody to take a few minutes and to think about what are five things we would need to do well in order to realize the mission statements that we were just talking about and working on together.

666
01:15:22,582 --> 01:15:26,604
Everyone will write them down on their sticky notes.

667
01:15:28,116 --> 01:15:35,042
They will come up to like a big whiteboard essentially and put up their sticky notes and then we will ask the whole group.

668
01:15:36,023 --> 01:15:39,326
Maybe there's 2 groups, depending on how many people are in the room.

669
01:15:39,966 --> 01:15:50,513
But then we'll ask the whole group to work together quietly, silently, to categorize the sticking notes, which is a process where everyone is at the board.

670
01:15:50,673 --> 01:15:52,074
Everyone is moving things around.

671
01:15:52,174 --> 01:15:54,435
Everyone is saying, like, this goes here, this goes here.

672
01:15:54,875 --> 01:16:03,201
But we're doing it quietly so that people are having to really engage with the process instead of getting sort of distracted in the chatter.

673
01:16:05,342 --> 01:16:07,724
The last, we'll be like, step back and take a look at it.

674
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:13,033
see everything that's there.

675
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:16,054
We'll facilitate like a walkthrough of that information.

676
01:16:16,094 --> 01:16:17,915
We'll give everyone a break.

677
01:16:18,175 --> 01:16:24,977
And then what we'll do during the break is we'll set up these groupings in different areas around the room.

678
01:16:25,097 --> 01:16:35,421
So if there is a grouping that is like after school, we'll take all of the after school stickies and off they will go to the after school sticky group.

679
01:16:35,821 --> 01:16:38,922
And when people come back from break, we'll ask them to like,

680
01:16:39,926 --> 01:16:43,910
pick a spot to go sort of check in on and work with.

681
01:16:44,691 --> 01:16:56,003
And we'll dive a little bit deeper into that topic around like, what is it that, you know, what don't they see that maybe they were surprised they didn't see?

682
01:16:57,364 --> 01:16:59,266
What surprised them about what they see?

683
01:16:59,487 --> 01:17:00,708
And ask each group

684
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:06,364
to give us a little bit more input on, like, why this thing is so important to them.

685
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:11,125
Like, why do they, if they're at the afterschool, like, board, why are they there?

686
01:17:11,205 --> 01:17:21,928
Like, what is it that has to work for them in order for them to feel like we're achieving the mission statements that we were talking about, whatever that ultimately becomes.

687
01:17:22,568 --> 01:17:31,290
And specifically about afterschool, so that there's, like, some richer data there than just, like, a bunch of sticky notes about things

688
01:17:31,829 --> 01:17:34,051
that people wish we could do and don't do.

689
01:17:35,332 --> 01:17:39,556
And then that's, like, that's the end.

690
01:17:39,676 --> 01:17:42,818
So two hours, everyone, and we're done, and everyone goes home.

691
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:53,968
The idea then would be, like, hosting several of these sessions around the community and being able to, like, aggregate all of that information

692
01:17:55,295 --> 01:18:11,727
And potentially, like, ask some of the, like, most engaged people to work with us to help us author, like, this setup to the strategic plan around what is our mission statement and how do we start to clearly talk about that and bring that back forward to the community.

693
01:18:11,747 --> 01:18:18,071
So that's the premise, is that this is, like, a collection, input collection opportunity.

694
01:18:19,972 --> 01:18:22,573
for the community to be part of this process.

695
01:18:23,253 --> 01:18:26,614
And then once we get through this, we get to phase two.

696
01:18:27,294 --> 01:18:31,715
Now we're talking about, okay, like, how would we do, how would we do this?

697
01:18:31,815 --> 01:18:41,698
Like, if this is where we want to go and these are the priorities, how, what is the actual plan that would take us from where we are to this place that we've described?

698
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:53,676
And that's the work that comes in that is like less about the community telling us what, how to do that and more about the superintendent telling us how to do that.

699
01:18:54,237 --> 01:19:01,361
So we're, so we get to, so we, as the community are clearly saying, here are our priorities and here's our, here are our goals.

700
01:19:01,982 --> 01:19:06,445
And now superintendent, you tell us, like, how are we going to make that happen?

701
01:19:07,085 --> 01:19:10,427
And what do we need to do to line up to that vision?

702
01:19:10,627 --> 01:19:11,348
So that's the idea.

703
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:21,801
Can you scroll up a little bit to the, I guess it's the sorting.

704
01:19:21,821 --> 01:19:26,893
This is a very awkward place for the need to do well.

705
01:19:40,128 --> 01:19:50,497
Because a piece that I had been thinking about of to say, if these are our, if this is our vision, if these are our values and our priorities, what does that look like?

706
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:54,060
Paint a picture for me of what that looks like.

707
01:19:57,743 --> 01:20:01,006
I think that's a slightly different approach than what's described here.

708
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:04,288
Got a mission statement.

709
01:20:04,629 --> 01:20:06,110
We need to do these things well.

710
01:20:13,749 --> 01:20:26,568
I think my concern is I'm not sure, depending on the group that this is, they may or may not know what it is that needs to be done to get there.

711
01:20:26,628 --> 01:20:30,013
I'm wondering if it's jumping a little bit too far into

712
01:20:35,028 --> 01:20:37,729
well, what does a school district do?

713
01:20:37,829 --> 01:20:39,510
What does the administration do?

714
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:46,712
Or maybe that's just the phrase, maybe that's a different way of phrasing what I'm saying of what does this look like in your daily life?

715
01:20:48,933 --> 01:21:03,898
And actually, let me step back a bit and ask, are these focus, do we envision these focus groups as being demographic specific that we've got all educators in the room doing this, or is it going to be a mix of

716
01:21:05,623 --> 01:21:17,545
caregivers and educators, recognizing of course, that some of our educators are also Medford caregivers, but are we, are the focus groups focused around who's in the room as well?

717
01:21:19,806 --> 01:21:27,447
I think they, I think they could be organized like in subsections.

718
01:21:27,487 --> 01:21:31,328
Like if for, if there's a focus group that we see like lots of, um,

719
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:37,961
educators at, like, we could group people, right?

720
01:21:38,001 --> 01:21:42,505
Like, we could group educators and caregivers separately.

721
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:51,812
Some of that, like, really, you sort of have to respond in the moment who shows up to say, like, okay, this is how we're going to, like,

722
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,461
deal with the crowd that we have.

723
01:21:54,581 --> 01:22:02,047
And some, if it's like a big session where you have lots of input, it does make sense to sort of like group people.

724
01:22:02,928 --> 01:22:09,072
But you may have a really small session where everybody working together is like, has its own value, right?

725
01:22:09,092 --> 01:22:10,834
Yeah.

726
01:22:10,974 --> 01:22:21,362
And just thinking academic excellence maybe looks different to someone who's in the classroom every day than it does to the parent.

727
01:22:24,097 --> 01:22:31,982
I would say to inform this work, we would need a cross section of stakeholder involvement here.

728
01:22:32,382 --> 01:22:47,511
And, you know, depending on, to Member Graham's point, like who's showing up, I think there are other opportunities that we are going to be capturing voice, because I also think students have a stake in this as well.

729
01:22:47,531 --> 01:22:49,893
And I thought I remembered

730
01:22:50,527 --> 01:23:03,130
earlier on there, there being a line about examples to like, uh, was there, there's something in here that stated about, um, examples from other districts.

731
01:23:04,671 --> 01:23:05,051
Yes.

732
01:23:05,511 --> 01:23:06,731
Um, where did I put that?

733
01:23:08,372 --> 01:23:18,074
Just to your point, member Graham, I think depending on where people are coming from, um, an exemplar is always

734
01:23:19,742 --> 01:23:20,983
Excuse me, good to have on hand.

735
01:23:26,205 --> 01:23:29,947
It's right here when when people break into their groups.

736
01:23:30,027 --> 01:23:30,247
Oops.

737
01:23:30,528 --> 01:23:30,868
Sorry.

738
01:23:32,329 --> 01:23:33,509
People break into their groups.

739
01:23:38,332 --> 01:23:47,737
I mean, I think it would be ideal if we had different groupings, but I think the challenges is the timing, you know, who's available when is just not going to.

740
01:23:48,804 --> 01:23:56,548
you know, we'd have to have so many more sessions if it's at an educator's set of times and a parent, caregiver set of times.

741
01:23:56,628 --> 01:24:04,292
And it's just, I think we will have to discuss how we're going to handle non-English speakers.

742
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:14,578
We want to make sure that they get support, but we can't have an army of interpreters there in case somebody shows up because that's going to be very expensive.

743
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:15,018
So, um,

744
01:24:18,993 --> 01:24:21,174
Well, that's, that's an accommodation question.

745
01:24:21,234 --> 01:24:31,880
That is, and yes, people are welcome to drop in, but if there's anything we can do to make this session more accessible, whether it's gluten free food or yeah.

746
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,481
Yeah.

747
01:24:33,741 --> 01:24:35,562
Language translation or 100%.

748
01:24:35,602 --> 01:24:43,946
And I also think that where we're going to have this in-person session matters.

749
01:24:44,727 --> 01:24:46,568
And I think, um,

750
01:24:48,224 --> 01:24:51,131
Member Graham, I don't know you had mentioned zoom, but I think that.

751
01:24:52,695 --> 01:24:54,519
A zoom option might be beneficial and.

752
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,661
for some of this work.

753
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:14,492
And I think we can talk about, we've done it a couple of ways in terms of having people here for interpretation live and in the moment, and also in like separate breakout groups where the whole thing can just be in their native language.

754
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:21,238
So I think I would like to make sure that I'm having those conversations with Ms.

755
01:25:21,278 --> 01:25:27,883
McNiff and our community liaisons to see what the best approach would be to gather that input.

756
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:35,394
Yeah, and I do think this isn't just one session.

757
01:25:35,414 --> 01:25:39,476
I think this is several sessions, right?

758
01:25:39,556 --> 01:25:46,501
Like how we do this, like, you know, some people are like, have this stuff on the weekend because that's when I can go.

759
01:25:46,561 --> 01:25:50,463
And other people are like, do not have this stuff on the weekend because that is when I cannot go, right?

760
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:56,848
And everything in between, like it's, you know, it's sort of a challenge.

761
01:25:58,196 --> 01:26:03,738
Um, I was thinking we would want to have, like, 5 or 6 sessions.

762
01:26:04,498 --> 01:26:07,419
I don't know how that number feels to all of you.

763
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:07,499
But.

764
01:26:14,922 --> 01:26:20,863
I, I mean, it seems small to me that number.

765
01:26:22,084 --> 01:26:25,525
I know it's a lot of work, but.

766
01:26:29,953 --> 01:26:30,273
I don't know.

767
01:26:30,293 --> 01:26:38,158
I mean, maybe we do five or six to start, and then like at three, we get together and decide, do we need to add more?

768
01:26:38,178 --> 01:26:42,000
I don't know.

769
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:54,648
I mean, we also have to acknowledge that like, if we get excellent participation, we're going to need, the analysis is going to be a massive task.

770
01:26:56,416 --> 01:27:00,777
when AI policy allows us to expedite that work.

771
01:27:02,897 --> 01:27:14,020
There's, I think there's one of the things we also find in surveys is there, you do hit a point when you start getting the same answers over and over.

772
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:20,181
And I don't know how many sessions of this it takes to get there.

773
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:24,302
I, I'm not sure five and six is too few.

774
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,362
I think we may

775
01:27:27,047 --> 01:27:28,227
see similar pieces.

776
01:27:28,307 --> 01:27:49,034
I also think that maybe the Zoom focus groups, if this is very sticky note, and I love sticky notes, if this is very sticky note based, the Zoom sessions might be about just going deeper into specific priorities that came out of the larger survey or that came out of these sessions is to say,

777
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:55,204
everyone prior everyone said this is important, but they didn't want to work on it.

778
01:27:55,344 --> 01:28:06,110
And so that's where we're having, we're going to have a conversation about this topic that that came up that needs more fleshing out.

779
01:28:06,191 --> 01:28:13,195
So I think the zoom sessions are potentially different than this, that they're about say more,

780
01:28:15,402 --> 01:28:16,383
than was on the survey.

781
01:28:16,443 --> 01:28:25,010
This is your chance to go deep and engage with other people and have a conversation and hear what it means to them.

782
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:29,253
And does that change how you see this priority?

783
01:28:30,902 --> 01:28:43,265
I would just respectfully ask for one, for at least a small number to be just Zoom, because I think we may have, I really want very much to try to capture as many voices as we can.

784
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:51,927
And I do think we have, in light of the current context, some people that may not feel comfortable participating if these sessions are in the evening.

785
01:28:52,947 --> 01:28:58,128
And I think Zoom is an option that

786
01:28:59,968 --> 01:29:03,931
I'm hoping we can get some voices to participate if they're able to do it from home.

787
01:29:06,473 --> 01:29:18,082
I also think, and I don't, forgive me if I miss this because in my transition out of the car, but it would be helpful to get the demographic survey results for folks at these as well.

788
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:29,239
Um, because, um, Erica's point about, you know, we start getting the same results, um, is important, but if we're getting the same results, and it's.

789
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:36,968
Because we're getting the same people same demographically, the same people that doesn't mean it's time to stop.

790
01:29:40,341 --> 01:29:44,364
That means it's time to shift and talk to different people.

791
01:29:44,564 --> 01:29:45,145
Absolutely.

792
01:29:45,305 --> 01:29:47,046
Yeah, but don't keep having the same conversations.

793
01:29:47,146 --> 01:29:50,949
I agree that that's, you know, there's only so many hours in the day.

794
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:51,850
Yeah.

795
01:29:53,591 --> 01:29:55,933
Okay.

796
01:29:55,973 --> 01:30:00,737
So, to your point, I think this is a, this is a useful framework and.

797
01:30:03,592 --> 01:30:07,853
who engages with it will inform what happens next.

798
01:30:08,174 --> 01:30:22,158
And because where, again, this is leading is that synthesis transition between what you initially described as stage one of engaging the community and phase two of creating an action plan.

799
01:30:22,698 --> 01:30:27,839
That synthesis comes out of this.

800
01:30:27,979 --> 01:30:30,240
It comes out of the survey and it comes out of the

801
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:43,298
Zoom focus groups that won't have, I mean, I guess there's jam boards and educators can tell us all about how to engage people on Zoom in this interactive way.

802
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:50,103
But I think also technology challenges can be a barrier as well.

803
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:51,784
Yeah, for sure.

804
01:30:52,965 --> 01:30:59,270
It's about the conversation and either the targeted questions or the tell me more.

805
01:31:00,595 --> 01:31:02,196
that you couldn't put in writing.

806
01:31:05,958 --> 01:31:16,105
That's an important component.

807
01:31:16,245 --> 01:31:18,546
This, what you've described here is the doing the work.

808
01:31:20,127 --> 01:31:24,650
And I think I just want to make sure the Zoom component as well is about hearing more voices.

809
01:31:26,432 --> 01:31:35,738
There's hearing what people have to say and there's doing the work of turning it into that mission, that vision, that action.

810
01:31:37,379 --> 01:31:37,579
Yeah.

811
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:50,387
And I think what I'm envisioning is that we would hold these sessions and then we would have another subcommittee to like,

812
01:31:52,323 --> 01:32:00,785
get that parsed and into some sort of like a working draft that could then go back to the school committee.

813
01:32:13,148 --> 01:32:17,088
Is that a natural transition to start talking about timeline, timing?

814
01:32:18,649 --> 01:32:18,869
Yes.

815
01:32:22,235 --> 01:32:32,498
Um, I will also say that I. We'll have more information coming soon about the timeline for.

816
01:32:33,358 --> 01:32:37,039
Community sessions around the high school project.

817
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:43,461
Um, but I think.

818
01:32:44,441 --> 01:32:50,263
The January deliverable is primarily about work that is happening.

819
01:32:51,777 --> 01:32:55,318
Inside the district with the plan, so I'm not anticipating.

820
01:32:57,139 --> 01:33:05,981
Tons of community oriented meetings between now and the end of January, although I could be wrong about the high school project for the high school.

821
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:11,743
And I do think timing wise trying to.

822
01:33:11,763 --> 01:33:11,803
Uh.

823
01:33:14,608 --> 01:33:20,093
Collect this input and feedback between now and the end of January is the right timing.

824
01:33:20,253 --> 01:33:29,941
If what we're endeavoring to do is like, have a productive conversation in the lead into decisions about a permanent superintendent on July 1.

825
01:33:32,283 --> 01:33:36,046
And a strategic plan that doesn't take another 5 years to build.

826
01:33:36,066 --> 01:33:43,692
I would anticipate you can have visioning sessions for the project in the next few months.

827
01:33:45,938 --> 01:33:47,339
For the community?

828
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,362
Yes, community stakeholders, parents.

829
01:33:50,963 --> 01:33:51,263
Okay.

830
01:33:51,564 --> 01:33:52,565
Some sort of a vision.

831
01:33:52,605 --> 01:33:54,366
I mean, this is how the other projects have been on run.

832
01:33:54,787 --> 01:33:55,047
Okay.

833
01:33:55,327 --> 01:34:03,275
Visioning sessions where they grab a bunch of people together and a couple sessions and they will show you different designs, different things.

834
01:34:03,335 --> 01:34:09,121
And you kind of put your posted note or your color stickers on what you like and gather information and stuff like that.

835
01:34:09,667 --> 01:34:13,470
I had thought that that ran kind of parallel with feasibility studies.

836
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:20,615
Am I. Yeah, it's starting in January is certainly the timeline that was presented to us.

837
01:34:21,456 --> 01:34:25,299
Well, there there's 2 deliverables that are part of the feasibility study.

838
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:26,500
1 is the.

839
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:30,683
Plan and the other is the.

840
01:34:30,703 --> 01:34:35,727
I'm going to get it wrong preferred schematic.

841
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:42,764
Design so the plan is like, what are we going to do in the building that is due in January?

842
01:34:44,505 --> 01:34:50,289
What what do we prefer the building to look like in order to do that is I think June.

843
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:55,512
So, okay, so that visioning does sound.

844
01:34:56,833 --> 01:34:59,335
Important for community input.

845
01:35:00,155 --> 01:35:02,757
So, I really am also really concerned here.

846
01:35:02,777 --> 01:35:04,799
About people's.

847
01:35:05,694 --> 01:35:09,578
fatigue in providing input as much as everyone wants to.

848
01:35:09,999 --> 01:35:11,060
Yeah.

849
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,604
It could come early or later in the feasibility study process.

850
01:35:15,064 --> 01:35:15,925
Depends on how they run it.

851
01:35:16,598 --> 01:35:25,160
It could strictly focus on, you know, because you have to do a lot of work on the number of spaces and the size and square footage and all that kind of stuff.

852
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:34,541
And then building placements and, you know, differentiating between, you know, renovation and new building and repair only options and stuff like that.

853
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:36,381
And then they may flip the design.

854
01:35:36,762 --> 01:35:44,983
I've seen it done the other way they do it first, but it's going to be interesting where the architect is just coming on board and we're kind of already moving forward to see how they structure it.

855
01:35:45,693 --> 01:35:52,038
Um, we have a meeting with the architects later this week, and we could certainly ask the OPM this question.

856
01:35:53,079 --> 01:35:57,542
So, by Monday, I can have some answers about, like, what we anticipate that looking like.

857
01:35:58,082 --> 01:36:02,205
Yeah, we want to.

858
01:36:02,385 --> 01:36:03,306
The fatigue thing is a.

859
01:36:05,054 --> 01:36:18,259
It's real, but I don't want that to be an excuse for not engaging people and have people say, but I wasn't, you know, I didn't have a chance to, to weigh in on the high school and on the strategic plan.

860
01:36:18,359 --> 01:36:20,960
And that's the matter of scheduling it.

861
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:21,780
Yeah.

862
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,022
So I everyone's favorite thing is scheduling.

863
01:36:29,723 --> 01:36:29,903
Yeah.

864
01:36:32,971 --> 01:36:50,334
That actually raises one point that also came up in the resolution is how things like the educational vision and the instructional vision, this work that has been done that feeds into strategic planning, how this comes into community input.

865
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:58,036
I think, you know, if you have a focus group around, if we say, oh yes, academic excellence is the priority, well, how does the instructional vision align?

866
01:36:59,848 --> 01:37:02,790
the process for bringing those pieces that already exist, right?

867
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:09,173
We're doing some focus work around this mission statement that exists that we know needs to be updated.

868
01:37:09,193 --> 01:37:13,216
But what about these other pieces that exist?

869
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:19,779
There's a capital planning conversation around the facilities and infrastructure.

870
01:37:19,799 --> 01:37:25,623
And maybe that's a little more phase two

871
01:37:28,348 --> 01:37:36,250
But I do want to acknowledge that those pieces exist and there has been some work done there as well.

872
01:37:39,091 --> 01:37:39,411
Yeah.

873
01:37:39,431 --> 01:37:45,393
I do think that part does start to, like, those puzzle pieces start to come together in phase two.

874
01:37:47,033 --> 01:37:54,835
And I think, frankly, like, wherever we, like, leave a draft of the mission statement, like,

875
01:37:55,247 --> 01:38:02,532
I think even that is going to be continuously fine-tuned while the strategic plan is created.

876
01:38:02,552 --> 01:38:10,337
I don't think that we should expect that there's not any change that happens there.

877
01:38:10,357 --> 01:38:14,760
I think that will certainly be tweaked and adjusted as we go.

878
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:22,945
But we want to have enough of an anchor that it can guide instead of follow.

879
01:38:24,146 --> 01:38:24,326
Yes.

880
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:32,053
All right, so I just moved us away and now I'll move us back to the scheduling.

881
01:38:32,093 --> 01:38:33,896
So it sounds like we need some more input.

882
01:38:34,417 --> 01:38:40,105
We need to know what the high school community schedule it looks like in order to.

883
01:38:41,627 --> 01:38:41,808
Yeah.

884
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:47,701
And I think we can, I'm sorry, I would just say in that meeting, can you ask what the flexibility is?

885
01:38:47,721 --> 01:38:52,342
Because I would love to know if they say, oh, no, we want to do it this way.

886
01:38:52,662 --> 01:38:58,243
But if we did it this other way, this is what it would look like if we say, well, we need to do this community input 1st.

887
01:38:58,383 --> 01:38:59,423
Is that even an option?

888
01:39:00,304 --> 01:39:01,204
Yeah, we can find out.

889
01:39:01,804 --> 01:39:02,164
Thank you.

890
01:39:05,805 --> 01:39:06,605
And then I can.

891
01:39:07,825 --> 01:39:14,774
look at the calendar and maybe, like, try to propose some dates for the school committee to think about.

892
01:39:15,615 --> 01:39:18,359
And then we would have to, like, think about locations and things like that.

893
01:39:18,419 --> 01:39:25,608
But with the holidays coming up, it is, like, a little bit sticky, maybe a lot sticky.

894
01:39:30,168 --> 01:39:39,272
And of course, I will note that there's also a question of whether the composition of the school committee stays the same or not, which can influence.

895
01:39:43,174 --> 01:39:43,674
That is true.

896
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:54,019
So I don't think we can, I think we just have to move forward.

897
01:39:57,721 --> 01:39:59,682
But yeah, we could.

898
01:40:01,817 --> 01:40:07,822
Change, I don't know, so we're reporting out on this Monday Monday.

899
01:40:07,842 --> 01:40:10,384
I don't think we have motions to.

900
01:40:13,687 --> 01:40:16,069
I think we need a motion that.

901
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:21,013
I will, like, get this cleaned up and prepared for Monday.

902
01:40:23,896 --> 01:40:31,920
So, and clean this up and get it ready for presentation on Monday to the school committee.

903
01:40:33,881 --> 01:40:37,743
And 2nd, if I remember, Reinfeldt will call the role member.

904
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:38,804
So, yes.

905
01:40:39,484 --> 01:40:40,565
Member Reinfeldt.

906
01:40:40,725 --> 01:40:42,146
Yes.

907
01:40:42,406 --> 01:40:42,626
Yes.

908
01:40:44,567 --> 01:40:47,488
So, I will clean it up and get it ready.

909
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:50,310
For Thursday.

910
01:40:52,287 --> 01:40:53,048
Thank you for all the work.

911
01:40:53,068 --> 01:40:54,148
Sorry, I wasn't here early.

912
01:40:54,889 --> 01:40:55,329
That's okay.

913
01:41:01,494 --> 01:41:07,679
Sorry, my sister's dog came in and she's sniffing furiously behind me and making a lot of noise.

914
01:41:07,939 --> 01:41:09,421
So it's very distracting.

915
01:41:13,124 --> 01:41:15,686
Are we at motion two?

916
01:41:17,521 --> 01:41:20,166
15 minutes early motion to adjourn 15.

917
01:41:24,193 --> 01:41:26,758
Motion adjourned by member, I felt seconded by members.

918
01:41:26,778 --> 01:41:28,742
So, uh, member, I felt yes.

919
01:41:29,444 --> 01:41:35,956
Remember, so and yes, uh, 3 in the affirmative 0 in the negative motion.
