I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:37,036
Motion by Councilor Longo Kern for suspension of the rules.

All in favor?

20
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:41,337
Motion passes.

21
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:42,677
Councilor Longo Kern.

22
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:44,538
Thank you, President Carviello.

23
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:46,899
Paper 18-023.

24
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,040
We have our city solicitor here.

25
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,201
18-023 offered by Councilor Longo Kern.

26
00:03:55,241 --> 00:04:02,643
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council go into executive session to discuss personal matters with the city solicitor.

27
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:03,203
Mr. Solicitor.

28
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:07,656
Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

29
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:08,636
My name is Mark Rumley.

30
00:04:08,676 --> 00:04:09,637
I'm the city solicitor.

31
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:12,098
I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

32
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:21,223
I read the resolution the other day in the snow, but I want to say something at the beginning before we entertain it, and I'm sure you'll understand.

33
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:27,187
I have no difficulty, nor does anyone else, discussing any personnel issue in general.

34
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:41,986
If the point of the resolution is about a specific individual, and I understand if it is, then the open meeting law would require that that person get notice that we're going to be discussing her or him.

35
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:49,852
And then they'd have also the ability to attend the executive session personally and with a representative.

36
00:04:50,352 --> 00:04:56,520
Now, I know that that sounds a little bit, it almost sounds like, well, that's putting a hurdle into the way of discussing it tonight.

37
00:04:56,881 --> 00:05:04,310
But if it is about a particular individual, then those procedural requirements of the open meeting law need to be followed.

38
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,595
And I'm very, very sure of this opinion.

39
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:23,103
So if we're discussing in general anybody, any prior personnel that has or will be potentially suing the city, then that would be named specifically, each of them would have to be notified?

40
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:24,825
Yes, even if that weren't the case.

41
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:31,251
For example, I don't know, I have not received notice of anybody suing the city about anything of this.

42
00:05:32,152 --> 00:05:46,986
In this general body of law, however, the statute which is Massachusetts general law chapter 38 section 21 says that if an individual is going to be discussed.

43
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:50,247
In executive session, they're entitled to notice of that.

44
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:53,389
So they can attend and attend with a representative if they choose.

45
00:05:54,689 --> 00:06:04,013
If that were, if it is about a particular personnel incident that relates to an individual, then we really should follow that in order to discuss it.

46
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:08,315
And I have no difficulty with that, but I want, and I encourage the council,

47
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:10,856
to follow that procedural requirement.

48
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:21,320
So if it's about a certain person, then notice would have to be given to them 48 hours before the meeting, and they would have a right to attend if they so chose.

49
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:30,424
So I just want to put that caveat out, which it's a point that doesn't always jump off the page when you think about discussion in executive session, but it is required.

50
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:36,267
So if anybody needs it better explained, I'll try.

51
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:41,556
I don't understand the moment.

52
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:48,086
I would like to discuss the matter.

53
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:49,747
I don't know how my colleagues feel.

54
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:56,352
It is specifically, I mean, in general, I had some questions, but it sounds like there may not be any.

55
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,756
Well, I think we need to notify the person.

56
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:03,838
I mean, there is one specific person that has been fired.

57
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:07,000
There has to be a purpose for a moment in the council.

58
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,182
We'll take a five minute recess.

59
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:18,785
I have no difficulty speaking with the counselor on the side to go over this in a little bit more depth, but I think she understands.

60
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:25,807
As a new member and this being the first time this came across to this issue came across to myself and how do we normally I know that in

61
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,733
With the school committee, we handle different situations a little bit differently.

62
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:45,977
Do we often, have we done this in the past?

63
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:55,546
We've talked to personnel matters and executive session with... If you're going to discuss a particular person or an incident that relates to a particular person, it is required.

64
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:56,307
The answer is yes.

65
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:58,089
I've been here 34 years.

66
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:02,153
It's been a while since I've seen this discussed in executive session, but it has.

67
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:19,697
Sometimes I believe in the school department, although I'm not the school department's attorney, when there are discipline matters or instances of faculty that are coming up about a particular faculty member, they would get notice, and I'm sure that the superintendent is well aware of what those requirements are.

68
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:24,138
And as I say, this is not a matter of saying nobody wants to discuss anything.

69
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:31,861
I want the procedural requirements followed if this is about a specific person and a personnel incident.

70
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:33,962
And I think that that's it.

71
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:34,502
Thank you.

72
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:35,222
Councillor Knight.

73
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:44,846
I think it would be helpful maybe if the sponsor of the resolution could kind of explain to us what exactly it is we're trying to accomplish here, what the situation is, and maybe we can go from there and figure out what direction we're going to go in.

74
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:51,812
Mr. President, yes, I need the same clarification.

75
00:08:52,432 --> 00:09:08,817
The resolution seems vague to me, and if I might add that I'm of the opinion that personnel matters regarding specific personnel, as far as our authority in those matters is known.

76
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:17,621
It's not under our purview, Mr. President, and one would wonder if it could be considered out of order.

77
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:22,964
Maybe, let's see, I make the suggestion that we have a caucus in a couple of minutes.

78
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:23,645
On what issue?

79
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:25,906
To make sure that we're going in the right direction.

80
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:30,708
I'm telling you that if we're going to discuss a particular person, you're going in the wrong direction.

81
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:33,210
Well, let's caucus for two minutes and see what the issue is.

82
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,793
Right, so in order to caucus, if what you're saying, Mr. President, is you want to go into executive session to caucus,

83
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:40,334
About what?

84
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:44,818
We're going to have a two-minute recess to discuss this.

85
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:46,079
All those in favor?

86
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:46,559
Motion passes.

87
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,882
You just can't discuss names.

88
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:00,564
We can discuss anything.

89
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:03,246
No, you cannot discuss names.

90
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:07,891
On the record, you cannot discuss anything in Executive Session just by going in.

91
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:09,412
What is the purpose of going in?

92
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:10,433
We're not going to Executive Session.

93
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:10,974
We have a caucus.

94
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:12,055
So what's a caucus?

95
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:16,487
I leave it to the chair to unravel this procedural quagmire.

96
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:13,704
This is the end of the video.

97
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:14,905
Thank you for watching.

98
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:37,548
Thank you for watching!

99
00:12:02,946 --> 00:12:03,687
Rue de la Bourse

100
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,423
I'm going to get a bit of an inside conversation about this violation of law right now.

101
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:01,314
Yes.

102
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,909
Thank you, President Carvalho.

103
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:33,634
I'm just going to put a motion forward that we have a committee at the home meeting next Tuesday night, whether that be 6.30, 6.45, and invite this prior employee to be present.

104
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:33,634
6.30?

105
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:33,634
6.45?

106
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,455
6.30.

107
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:35,455
On the motion by Council Member Kern.

108
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:42,486
Councilor Knight.

109
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:46,907
So we're inviting them to a committee of the whole, as opposed to going into executive session?

110
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:47,407
Yes.

111
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,287
Okay, no problem with that.

112
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:49,547
Thank you.

113
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,308
Councilor Del Rosso.

114
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:55,708
Is the solicitor still available?

115
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,729
I think we'll invite him.

116
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:00,029
No.

117
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:01,529
Is he here at present?

118
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:01,970
He is here.

119
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:09,611
If I can, through the Chair, Mr. President, ask the solicitor what authority the City Council has over personnel matters.

120
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:19,304
The authority in the sense of immediate jurisdiction, discretionary jurisdiction, the ability to make personnel decisions?

121
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:19,784
Correct.

122
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:20,485
None.

123
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:21,365
Thank you.

124
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:23,066
Thank you.

125
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:24,508
All right.

126
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:29,371
On the motion by Councilor Locurando to have a committee at the whole meeting next week at 6.30.

127
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,914
Seconded by Councilor Mox.

128
00:15:32,954 --> 00:15:33,554
All those in favor?

129
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:33,975
Aye.

130
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:35,215
Motion passes.

131
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,356
Opposed, Mr. President?

132
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,438
Mox, Councilor Dela Rousseau is opposed.

133
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:40,379
Mr. Spence, Mr. President, paper 1809.

134
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:46,233
Following the suspension, communications from the Mayor, 1-8-0-1-9.

135
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:59,598
Dear Mr. President, Councillors, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honourable Body approve the following amendments of revised order entitled, Compensation Plans, and leave order to Chapter 66 personnel.

136
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:02,059
City of Medford, Amendment 2.

137
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:06,241
Mr. President, maybe we could wait for the meeting and have a presentation by the administration?

138
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:07,541
That would be fine.

139
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:08,922
Mr. President?

140
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,494
I would ask in this paper that the paper fully be read.

141
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:21,404
This is an important paper that deals with the expenditure of city funds.

142
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:23,727
So I would ask that we read the paper on this one.

A separate paper is on the agenda for your consideration, for every truly yours, Stephanie Ann Burke, Mayor.

160
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:55,887
Councillor DelaRusso.

161
00:19:56,468 --> 00:19:57,148
Move approval.

162
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:04,314
On the motion by Councillor DelaRusso, seconded by Councillor Falco.

163
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:05,355
Mr. Clerk.

164
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:07,372
Councilor Knight.

165
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:09,214
Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

166
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:13,217
It's my understanding that this paper has already been ratified by the Metro Police Patrolmen's Association.

167
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:15,678
It was voted unanimously by the membership.

168
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:21,322
It also includes the cost of living adjustment retroactive to the date of expiration of the predecessor agreement, Mr. President.

169
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:25,265
This was a product of a lot of hard work between the administration and the Patrolmen's Association.

170
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:34,371
I think that the term, it's about time, is something that we'll all share in this one, and it's certainly something that I support wholeheartedly, and I'd concur with my colleague's motion.

171
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:37,557
And this is the takings of first reading.

172
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:39,641
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

173
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:47,144
Vice President DelaRusso.

174
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:47,444
Yes.

175
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:49,405
Councilor Falco.

176
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:49,685
Yes.

177
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:51,125
Councilor Night.

178
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:51,405
Yes.

179
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:52,805
Councilor Lueb.

180
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:53,446
Yes.

181
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:54,346
Councilor Marx.

182
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:54,846
Yes.

183
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:56,046
Councilor Scarpelli.

184
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:56,526
Yes.

185
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:57,506
President Canvillo.

186
00:20:57,746 --> 00:20:57,987
Yes.

187
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,267
7 in the affirmative.

188
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:05,308
Motion passes and takes its first reading.

189
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:10,469
Motion by Councilor Night to waive the three readings.

190
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,310
Second by Councilor DelaRusso.

191
00:21:16,364 --> 00:21:17,045
Councilor Marks.

192
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:19,426
Thank you Mr. President.

193
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:32,396
This council, just for the edification of the council and the viewing audience that this council back some time ago has been on record not to waive readings which was

194
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:37,409
the way it was done in the past, Mr. President.

195
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:45,531
And the firefighters that came before us, I think it was roughly a year and a half, two years ago, requested the same thing of waiving the readings.

196
00:21:46,092 --> 00:21:47,792
And I believe it was a unanimous vote.

197
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,113
I could be corrected if not.

198
00:21:49,653 --> 00:22:02,277
But what happens, Mr. President, and this body, and I'm sure the police department could agree, as well as the residents of this community is, you know, when we talk about transparency, it's not just the word transparency.

199
00:22:02,777 --> 00:22:03,958
It actually means something.

200
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:10,081
And to waive readings is, in my opinion, doing away with the public process.

201
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:15,323
And the first reading is when it appears on the council agenda.

202
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:20,206
The second reading is when the city clerk puts it out for notification in the local paper.

203
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:26,234
Which makes it open and notorious for people in the community if they're interested in the issue.

204
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:33,465
And the final and third reading is for public input and approval or not by the council.

205
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:35,628
And by waiving the readings,

206
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:43,235
You're doing away, even though you still have to have the second reading, which is notification, which is required by state statute in the local paper.

207
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:52,544
You're doing away with the final reading, which allows residents of this community, and even members of the union if they want to come up, and address the council before they vote on it.

208
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:54,987
And it's doing away with the public process.

209
00:22:55,667 --> 00:23:00,051
And I offered that statement back, I believe it was about two years ago,

210
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:09,337
The protocol for this council would always be to waive the readings, and the theory was that the unions would get their check a little quicker.

211
00:23:10,218 --> 00:23:19,344
And that sounds great in theory, and I want to make sure that the brave men and women of the police department get their check, but I also want to make sure that we follow the proper protocol.

212
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:26,692
and process, Mr. President, that we're bound by as a council to this community.

213
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:39,287
And I think the process, the way we want to work it with going through three readings will take roughly two and a half to three weeks by the time it comes back to us after it's published in the paper.

214
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:54,295
And I think after two or three year bargaining session that the unions had with the mayor and so forth, that to wait and follow this through the entire process, which is another two or three weeks, is not much to ask, Mr. President.

215
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:57,737
I think it sets good...

216
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:10,475
protocol in this community to follow the letter of the law, and the letter of the law states three readings on a paper of this magnitude, Mr. President.

217
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:13,917
So I could not support that here tonight, Mr. President, based on that.

218
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:24,116
Councilman, it's my understanding that the waiving of the three readings must be unanimous by the body, so it's not necessarily a policy of this council, but it was one individual council that didn't feel as though waiving the readings was appropriate.

219
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:29,817
With that being said, I feel as though the plight of the police department has been quite open and quite transparent over the past several years.

220
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:31,658
They've made us very aware of what's going on.

221
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:36,079
However, with that being said, if we don't have the support of the council, we don't have the right to waive the three readings, so I withdraw my motion.

222
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,680
Mr. Clerk.

223
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:44,401
Thank you.

224
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:49,335
18-020.

225
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:53,619
To the Honorable Members.

226
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:08,712
Dear Mr. President, Councillors, in regards to the paper below you this evening regarding the proposed increase to the Metro Patrolmen's Association in amendment to Chapter 66, Article 2, Section 66,

227
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,574
Please transfer $550,000 from the free cash accounts.

228
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:11,634
010-210-5110.

229
00:25:11,654 --> 00:25:19,116
This paper is necessary to cover retroactive payments from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017 of $400,000 and a portion of the estimated increase to wages from January 1,

230
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:39,945
To June 30, 2018 of $150,000.

231
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,110
Further, I respectfully request that you transfer $200,000 from the negotiated salaries accounts, 010-1-2-51102.

232
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:10,605
1-1-1-2-0-1-0-2-1-0-5-1-1-0, to cover the balance of the impact on the fiscal 18 budget from January 1 to June 30, 2018.

233
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:14,786
Yours truly, Stephanie Anberic, Mayor.

234
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,287
Councillor DelaRusso.

235
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:17,687
Move approval.

236
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:19,268
Second.

237
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,334
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

238
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,656
Councilor Longo-Kurin.

239
00:26:23,796 --> 00:26:25,419
Thank you, President Carviello.

240
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:33,152
If I could just ask a question about the payment from January 1 to June 30, that's going to cost...

241
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:40,418
So those, the next six months till the end of the fiscal year is gonna cost $350,000?

242
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:41,920
Correct.

243
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:49,146
So we're looking at a $700,000 increase in the budget per fiscal year with this paper?

244
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:54,651
This includes a retro payment, so altogether it's $750,000 including the retro.

245
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,356
Including retro, but I mean,

246
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:12,162
But we need the January 1st, the $350,000 to cover January 1st to June 30th, 2018 is $350,000.

247
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:12,723
Correct.

248
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:13,163
Okay.

249
00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:17,645
So that's six months and it's going to be $350,000.

250
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,225
That doesn't, that's not retro.

251
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:20,986
That's not the retro, no.

252
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:23,127
I'm just saying the total paper for $750,000.

253
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:24,488
That's the question I'm asking.

254
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:26,468
So I agree, that's not retro.

255
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:28,169
So that's $350,000 to cover from January 1st

256
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:33,054
hasta junio del 30 de 2018.

257
00:27:33,174 --> 00:27:43,602
Así que, según mis calculaciones, estamos mirando a un aumento en el actual budget del próximo año fiscal de alrededor de $700,000.

258
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:45,243
Sí, 2% sobre lo que tienen ahora.

259
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:48,325
Así que alrededor de $700,000, de la forma en que lo miramos.

260
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:51,468
Esa fue mi pregunta.

261
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:51,708
Gracias.

262
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,613
En la moción, por el Councilor DelaRusso, seguido por el Councilor Falco.

263
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,335
Señor abogado, por favor, llame la rola.

264
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:03,875
Vice President DelaRusso?

265
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:04,355
Yes.

266
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:05,576
Councilor Falco?

267
00:28:05,676 --> 00:28:05,916
Yes.

268
00:28:06,736 --> 00:28:07,317
Councilor Maggi?

269
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:07,937
Yes.

270
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:09,198
Councilor Lockern?

271
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:09,558
Yes.

272
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:10,959
Councilor March?

273
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:11,339
Yes.

274
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,620
Councilor Scott-Bell?

275
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,020
Yes.

276
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,261
President Caviello?

277
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:14,881
Yes.

278
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:17,623
7 in the permanent, none in the negative.

279
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:20,445
While we're on the suspension, Councilor Lockern?

280
00:28:21,225 --> 00:28:22,466
Thank you, President Carballo.

281
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:27,350
I believe we just have one more resident in the audience.

282
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,991
I think we've disposed of all the city matters.

283
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:37,717
Resident in the audience would like a minute or two to speak about an issue with regards to the plowing over the last couple storms.

284
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:39,859
Thank you.

285
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:42,040
Name and address for the record, please.

286
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:44,502
Good evening.

287
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:46,003
My name is Ronald Paone.

288
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:48,425
I live on 314 Winthrop Street in Medford.

289
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:52,219
Thank you, Mr. President and councillors for listening.

290
00:28:52,739 --> 00:28:54,799
This will be my second journey up to this podium.

291
00:28:55,379 --> 00:29:01,701
I came here last year when the fire department and the police department were doing their thing and I didn't get called in until about 9.30.

292
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,581
Anyway, I'm having the same issue as I did last year.

293
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:12,543
We have city trucks that are being operated by individuals who really

294
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:29,598
They're not really doing their job, and I'm sorry to complain about this, but before I get to the issue about where I live, I have an only sister who lives on Lewis Street in Medford, which is off of Fulton Street, and that street is deplorable, I'm sorry.

295
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:33,980
During the ice storm, they didn't even come down and salt it.

296
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:41,723
Uh, there was supposed to be, uh, parking just on the right, and that street was, you know, both sides were filled with cars.

297
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:44,504
So those city plows didn't have an opportunity to get down there.

298
00:29:44,524 --> 00:29:51,367
Now, if anybody's ever been on that street, you really can't even navigate if you even try to get down there with a UPS truck or something like that.

299
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:52,307
I'm not even talking about that.

300
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:54,248
I'm just talking about regular people going down there.

301
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:57,009
And Lewis Street, it's off Fulton.

302
00:29:57,989 --> 00:30:07,394
Okay, I just wanted to mention that because, again, that's my elderly sister, and, you know, I kind of have to watch out for her once in a while, you know, she slip and fall, that kind of stuff.

303
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:10,255
Anyway, now the issue with me.

304
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:25,402
My driveway, I have 110 foot from the street to the garage in the back, 110 feet straight in, and then I have about 60 feet to the right if you're facing the house, so it's probably about 1,500 to 2,000 square feet of pavement.

305
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:29,665
And I have to do a lot of work there.

306
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:38,230
As the city drivers come by on the snow days, they're pushing the snow and they're doing their job.

307
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:45,095
When they get near that end of Winthrop Street, they're usually about a foot to two feet away from the curb.

308
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,416
And it continues and continues and continues.

309
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:57,178
And as we, you know, the storm is breaking and slowing down and whatever, and they're wrapping up for the night, it's usually still there.

310
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:08,060
So what I usually do is I go out and I get in my, I have a bobcat and I go out in the front and I get the snow close to the curb and I stockpile it and I flatten it down so it's not too high, the banks.

311
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,801
Council and I could have tested that.

312
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:15,183
He sees that I keep my property up, up, up, up, okay?

313
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:19,724
And, uh, so it was, uh, Thursday night after the storm.

314
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:34,909
I wrapped up around 10, went in the house, took a shower, went to sleep around 12, 1 o'clock, hear a big bang, jump out of bed, go outside, and there's cascaded snow over the bank onto the sidewalk.

315
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:37,850
Again, I'm talking chunks of snow, and there's about

316
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:43,092
Six inches of just ice and snow buried in front of my driveway now.

317
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:46,173
The driveway next to me is a Butman.

318
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:47,773
It's the elderly nursing home.

319
00:31:48,694 --> 00:31:50,654
So I have a good rapport with the woman there.

320
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:54,996
And I had to open it up because her plow driver had already gone home for the night.

321
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:58,357
So her employees would never have been able to get on the 7 o'clock shift.

322
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:00,158
So I opened her up also.

323
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:03,094
It was just a real bad night.

324
00:32:03,294 --> 00:32:05,195
And this is not the first time this has happened.

325
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:13,241
Uh, the ice storm that I previously mentioned beforehand, two storms ago, uh, where we got the inch, uh, the inch and a half of ice.

326
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:16,102
Uh, one of this, I observed at 1 a.m.

327
00:32:16,122 --> 00:32:20,485
in the morning on that particular day, I think it was a Saturday, that the, the ice storm happened.

328
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:27,790
Uh, a city truck, it was a 28,000 pound truck, one of the big dump trucks with a 10 foot plow and a salter.

329
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:38,437
Goin' up and down Winthrop Street from Lawrence Road to the Circle, and there's this big bump in the middle of the street, he bottomed out as he went over it, so he was moving at an excessive speed.

330
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:41,639
And he was just salting, he wasn't plowing, he was just salting.

331
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,041
And I watched him as I stepped outside as he...

332
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:47,944
went around the rotary and came back going towards Lawrence Road at excessive speed.

333
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:54,970
So now, proper speed for any type of equipment should be anywhere between 5 and 10 miles an hour, and that's a fact.

334
00:32:55,271 --> 00:33:00,756
Okay, I've been in this business for over four decades, so I know what I'm talking about.

335
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:06,240
This is not my personal opinion, but you know, I believe that the city taxpayers pay for this equipment.

336
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:07,996
If I'm not mistaken.

337
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:11,798
And I, you know, I would think that there would be a little bit more.

338
00:33:12,098 --> 00:33:14,720
And I get that, you know, I know about blood money.

339
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,200
You're out in the snow storms.

340
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,781
You're doing a lot of hours worth of work.

341
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:18,922
You just want to get it done.

342
00:33:18,982 --> 00:33:19,622
You want to get home.

343
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:20,182
I get that.

344
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:20,963
All right.

345
00:33:21,343 --> 00:33:27,946
But, you know, sometimes you got to, like, understand that, like, you can't be doing, you know, hurting others, you know.

346
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:31,167
And this incident happened last year where the same thing.

347
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:36,370
They hit the snow bank in front of the house and cascaded the snow onto the sidewalk, and I just wrapped up.

348
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:40,913
I don't like to pay for real estate twice, if anybody can understand that expression.

349
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:42,135
I don't like to do jobs twice.

350
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:45,702
I just, I want to get it done, I want to stop, and that's the end of it.

351
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:59,668
You know, my fear is that, and this is not even a personal fear, is that maybe, you know, there could be a dog or something crossing the street, or a stray cat, and, you know, the guy's driving by doing 30 miles an hour, hits one of them, or even a person.

352
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:04,372
We got a lot of people that are out in that hour, and I see it at 1 a.m.

353
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:06,233
in the morning, they're crossing streets and stuff like that.

354
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,094
You know what I mean?

355
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:08,095
And, you know.

356
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:11,156
I don't know what's going on, but, you know, I think it should be addressed.

357
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:22,381
I'm really a little frustrated, because, like, we still got a whole couple more months of maybe more snow, and I don't want to have to, like, come back up here and complain.

358
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:26,423
And it's not, again, I'm not, do not want to see anybody lose their job.

359
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:34,505
I believe that the city is full of good employees that take pride in their jobs, and I'm not looking to put a hammer on anybody.

360
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:37,246
I mentioned at 11 a.m.

361
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:41,667
Friday morning, I called the mayor's office and I said, I'd like to make a complaint.

362
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:44,208
And the person that was on the other end said,

363
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:48,142
We're not taking complaints today, and then my phone went dead.

364
00:34:48,182 --> 00:34:54,469
Now, I have this old phone, if anybody wants to see it, it's old, and maybe it was my phone that might have disconnected, but all of a sudden, the line went dead.

365
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,251
So, I didn't call back.

366
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:58,133
I said, let me address it.

367
00:34:59,405 --> 00:34:59,905
to this board.

368
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:00,806
You know what I mean?

369
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:02,767
If you can do anything to help, please.

370
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:09,191
I mean, this is something that I think should be addressed by you guys, you know, and Brianna.

371
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:17,277
And let me tell you, I mean, I'm probably not the only resident that could come up here and start complaining about, you know, the services of, you know, the city.

372
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:22,480
But these are just incidences that I don't like to have to, you know, continue to come up here and talk about.

373
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,062
You know, I mean, I've been making amends to this city for 30 years.

374
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:32,528
Thirty years from all the trouble that I caused back in the seventies and early eighties, okay?

375
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:35,291
So I'm trying to be a nice guy.

376
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:36,413
You are forgiven.

377
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:42,899
I'm trying to be a nice guy, but I'm also human, and I also have that Italian temper.

378
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,082
Chief Sackle can attest to that.

379
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:54,169
So, you know, I'm glad everybody's chuckling, but you know, I can laugh at myself these days, you know, and again, if anything you guys could do for me, I would greatly appreciate it.

380
00:35:54,189 --> 00:36:03,275
Please, I'm not looking to fight, get anybody fired, but just maybe pass the word down so somebody has observation on their, you know, who's ever supervising this operation.

381
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:04,336
Perfect.

382
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:05,437
Thank you very much.

383
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,432
I think we've all got a number of complaints a number of.

384
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:26,375
Good words and obviously the complaints are the ones we get the most and we've got a number of complaints.

385
00:36:26,415 --> 00:36:34,380
I think this is Winthrop Street where sidewalk was reblocked after, you know, taking probably hours to shovel it out.

386
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,461
I think we also got a couple from High Street.

387
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:41,324
I've got complaints about tainter and I think we're trying to, I'm trying to myself,

388
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:42,945
email.

389
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:48,667
I know Sergeant Hartnett and Lauren from the mayor's office is fielding a number of complaints.

390
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:50,888
This is one I haven't reached out.

391
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:52,969
I know you potentially were coming tonight.

392
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:59,031
So I think that we need to just get a check on whoever is doing.

393
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:04,873
This is the second complaint I got with regards to Winthrop Street and just the plow driver driving extremely fast.

394
00:37:04,953 --> 00:37:06,614
And I think that may be where the problem is.

395
00:37:06,954 --> 00:37:07,875
They're going too fast.

396
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:10,496
They're not doing it, you know, obviously properly.

397
00:37:10,556 --> 00:37:11,376
So maybe if we could

398
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:40,418
just send that off to our DPW to take a look at where the complaints are coming from and who's actually doing those routes if it's in-house or if I know we have a lot of contractors this was the first storm it was a huge storm we got over a foot of snow and it was it was hard for anybody to keep up the residents the DPW a lot of streets were done great but yes we're getting the complaints we we aren't Somerville I think we've got pitches tonight of Somerville streets and no we're not Somerville we did

399
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:45,242
City did purchase a nice piece of equipment that's going to help us with our sidewalks but it's not in yet.

400
00:37:45,982 --> 00:38:06,098
So there are improvements that need to be made and hopefully we can learn from this current storm and move to make sure that those where the complaints are coming from if we can get a grip on it so that in the next couple months where we get the more snow it can be handled in a better fashion and we you know obviously will fix the problems that we had during the storm.

401
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:20,877
So, obviously, Winthrop Street, if we can check out who the driver is there, just give them some feedback, as well as any other complaints that have come in from either us or the mayor's office, if we can kind of, obviously, before the next storm.

402
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:22,585
Get a handle on it.

403
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:24,888
On the motion, Councilor Scott Pelley.

404
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:26,129
Oh, I'm sorry.

405
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:28,252
Thank you.

406
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:29,273
Yes.

407
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:29,533
No.

408
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:32,417
On the motion, Councilor Knight.

409
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,259
Mr. President, thank you very much.

410
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:39,045
One of the issues that I'm seeing in the community relative to snow removal, Mr. President, is the fact that there's a lack of

411
00:38:40,346 --> 00:38:43,428
Equipment standards for the plows that we contract with.

412
00:38:43,928 --> 00:38:52,372
So we could have a, you know, three quarter ton F250 out there with a plow on it that's getting paid the same rate as somebody that has a Jeep Wrangler with a plow on it pushing snow around.

413
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:58,775
And I think we're getting more bang for our buck out of somebody that has a three quarter ton truck than somebody that's driving around in a quarter ton truck pushing snow.

414
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:11,066
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd also like to ask that the DPW Director report back to the City Council what equipment standards are in place for those that are being allowed to contract plow with the City of Medford.

415
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:13,428
Thank you, Councilor.

416
00:39:18,698 --> 00:39:20,439
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

417
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:22,762
Thank you Mr. President.

418
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:34,074
One of the major complaints that I've received over the last few days is the fact that our corners are not being shoveled out or plowed out.

419
00:39:35,174 --> 00:39:42,278
Most of the plows are bringing the snow up to the corner, and you'll see snow banks five, six feet tall.

420
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:50,962
It makes it very difficult for residents who want to get out there and do the right thing to shovel these giant mounds.

421
00:39:50,982 --> 00:39:56,344
I think the city has to do a better job in connecting our streets and our walking paths.

422
00:39:57,385 --> 00:40:02,047
I, as one person that commutes on the MBTA every morning, can tell you that

423
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:04,470
You can't make it down many roads now.

424
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:17,585
Riverside Ave, there are literally some paths down Riverside Ave that seem to be, and I don't know how you shovel like a six inch path, but the path is literally, it's six inches wide.

425
00:40:18,385 --> 00:40:34,934
I don't know how it gets like that, but some of the frustration that I hear from residents on main roads is the fact that they'll go out there and shovel, and then within an hour, a truck comes by and throws three times as much as they've already shoveled back on their sidewalk.

426
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:49,482
They have to constantly be out there, and I don't know, maybe with this new piece of equipment, we can try to address some of the major roads, High Street, Winthrop Street, Salem Street, Main Street, you know, Fulton Street.

427
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:52,424
We need, and it's great to have one piece of equipment.

428
00:40:53,044 --> 00:41:11,827
But in a city this size, really, you know, I know they made a big hill of blue about this one piece of equipment they just bought, but you need probably five or six of those in a city this size to do the job in our business districts and around our schools and on our major thoroughfares.

429
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:15,448
So those are the complaints I received, Mr. President.

430
00:41:15,488 --> 00:41:16,668
Temple Street was a mess.

431
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:21,049
There were a number of streets out there that seemed to be forgotten.

432
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:31,755
And I'm not sure what happens when plows don't go down a street at all, if it's just an oversight or if it's something larger.

433
00:41:32,196 --> 00:41:40,201
The second point is that there was a number to call regarding if you had a complaint that was sent out on reverse 911.

434
00:41:41,742 --> 00:41:46,585
And I can tell you that that number wasn't minned around the clock.

435
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:51,006
At least from the calls that I received, it wasn't manned around the clock.

436
00:41:51,366 --> 00:42:10,790
And when you have a snow emergency, you really have to have a 24-hour hotline, you really do, that residents can call and feel that they have someone to speak to, and at least the person on the other end is listening and letting them know, you know, ma'am, we're in a major snowstorm and, you know, we're gonna get to it, it's on our list.

437
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,892
And I think that's extremely important that we have that set up.

438
00:42:16,252 --> 00:42:38,823
And I would ask that we recommend to the city administration that a 24-hour hotline during snow emergencies, so if the emergency is in effect for three days, it's three days of a 24-hour hotline that residents can call and get a response on the other end and at least know that this situation will eventually be addressed, Mr. President.

439
00:42:40,823 --> 00:42:41,945
Thank you, Councilman Marks.

440
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:44,087
Chair recognizes President Caravello.

441
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:45,549
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

442
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:56,163
Putting the city aside, I think the city needs to contact some of the state people, because Mystic Avenue

443
00:42:56,783 --> 00:43:03,624
whoever plowed down there just dumped all the snow onto the sidewalks and talk about corners that you can't see around.

444
00:43:04,964 --> 00:43:10,045
They were just dumped, the people who own the commercial businesses just dumped it onto the corners too.

445
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:23,648
So I think someone needs to go down, especially on the Mystic Avenue end and clean some of those corners off and the sidewalks where these people just dumped tremendous amounts of snow, Mr. Vice President.

446
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:29,323
Thank you.

447
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,145
Thank you, Mr. President.

448
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:36,388
I would actually like to amend the resolution if it's okay.

449
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:53,262
And just to find out how many independent plowers that we hire during a storm because and if there's any and if the DPW director could let us know is there any type of meeting with the I guess the hiring process for the independent plowers because it seems like

450
00:43:54,582 --> 00:43:55,663
I try to get it.

451
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:58,524
Do these people actually check for experience?

452
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:02,807
I mean, does someone just have a plow and they apply to be an independent driver and they can plow?

453
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:04,807
They plowed before in the past.

454
00:44:06,413 --> 00:44:10,456
I wanna know, do we have any standards for hiring independent plow drivers?

455
00:44:10,576 --> 00:44:19,761
Because it seems like right now there's, and I'm not an expert with regard to plowing streets, but we need to know.

456
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:25,064
I'd like to know, what are we looking for when we look at hiring independent plows?

457
00:44:25,485 --> 00:44:26,845
And I think that needs to be looked at.

458
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:30,247
So if I can amend the paper to reflect that.

459
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:33,009
And I also agree that hotline is needed.

460
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:34,290
I did get a number of calls.

461
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,191
from people saying that they did call the DPW number and it just rang.

462
00:44:39,251 --> 00:44:41,412
It was just consistently busy.

463
00:44:41,452 --> 00:44:47,094
So if we could, I definitely agree that a hotline would be something that we should look into.

464
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:47,874
Thank you.

465
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:48,815
Excellent.

466
00:44:48,855 --> 00:44:49,715
Thank you, Councilor.

467
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:56,382
On the motion as amended severally, Chair recognizes again Councillor Marks.

468
00:44:56,803 --> 00:44:57,924
Thank you Mr. President.

469
00:44:58,585 --> 00:45:05,313
I think it's important also if we find out how many tickets were issued during this previous snowstorm.

470
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:27,235
for residents not shoveling, and I had a brief conversation because he was so busy with the foreman for Highway Steve Tanaglia, and I asked him why the state highways seemed to be down to the pavement after it snowed, and why some of our streets were not.

471
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:33,980
And I asked whether we were using the same mixture that they put down prior to the snow.

472
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,622
And he said that we don't use the same mixture.

473
00:45:38,343 --> 00:45:50,972
And it's something that him and the DPW commissioner are going to review and see whether or not they should go closer to the formula that the state uses that they put down.

474
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:56,577
In my opinion, just from living near the Felsway, whatever they put down works miracles.

475
00:45:58,518 --> 00:46:11,709
It does a tremendous job keeping the snow from building up, the ice, and I think whatever they're using, we should follow suit, Mr. President, on many of our side streets and roads and main roads.

476
00:46:13,618 --> 00:46:13,978
Thank you.

477
00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:16,501
Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Pelley.

478
00:46:17,061 --> 00:46:28,592
If I can I'd be remiss that I know this has been a tough time and you're talking about 16 inches of snow and obviously we will have hiccups but I will tell you I think all of us failed at many many phone calls.

479
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:33,917
I personally probably about 30 in two days and some of those calls were

480
00:46:35,218 --> 00:46:56,378
The elderly people with health issues and one of the concerns that they couldn't get in touch with anybody at City Hall because City Hall is closed or DPW directly, but I will tell you, kudos to Brian Cairns, our director, and Steve Tenagula and his crew because I tell you what,

481
00:46:57,479 --> 00:47:07,370
When we did have a few issues, those people called me back within half an hour to tell me that someone did come out and did take care of some of their problems.

482
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:17,541
So I wish it was that easy with everybody, but I know that when I reached out, especially for any handicapped or elderly or

483
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:25,470
or medical issues, I think that has to be addressed.

484
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:34,419
So I thank them, which if we can, could we also ask as part of this resolution that do we have a list of

485
00:47:36,421 --> 00:48:00,978
residents that have health issues that that I know that we talked about doing roadwork in closing down streets that we have a list of residents that have that are on dialysis that need to be that need to that need to be transported and I was wondering if we can ask if we have that in case of any type of

486
00:48:01,918 --> 00:48:15,864
Snowstorm, a natural disaster that we can assist our DPW or the community with any issues, can help them with that.

487
00:48:16,424 --> 00:48:20,886
So if we can ask that, if there is a list that exists, or maybe that we look into doing it.

488
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:21,526
Very good.

489
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:22,607
I'll have Reggie, please.

490
00:48:24,207 --> 00:48:24,727
Thank you.

491
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:27,889
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

492
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:31,412
On the motion, Citizen wishes to address us.

493
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:33,053
Welcome, Citizen.

494
00:48:33,153 --> 00:48:35,335
Please state your name and address for the record.

495
00:48:35,355 --> 00:48:37,617
Happy New Year, Council Vice President.

496
00:48:38,137 --> 00:48:41,580
My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

497
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,161
More observations than a complaint.

498
00:48:45,243 --> 00:48:48,826
I drove an elderly friend, a friend of a parent,

499
00:48:50,255 --> 00:48:58,303
Of the people I visited for Christmas and for New Year's, and he lives in Medford, and they live over near Logan Airport, so I do the family a big favor picking him up.

500
00:48:59,124 --> 00:49:08,192
His street over near Cappy's, horrendous, and this is, my street was okay, so, you know, on that side it was okay, but I'm watching like a senior citizen, it was like.

501
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:11,355
Christmas, there was a lot of snow in the street.

502
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:12,615
It was very difficult to drive.

503
00:49:13,656 --> 00:49:17,178
Um, I keep a lot of my vinyl albums over at Medford Self Storage.

504
00:49:17,879 --> 00:49:18,339
A lot of them.

505
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:25,603
And so as I'm going through Lawrence Road, um, it's interesting that you can't see past the mounds.

506
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:27,284
So Councilor Caraviello is correct.

507
00:49:27,785 --> 00:49:30,106
Uh, there are some areas, and I'm not blaming the plow people.

508
00:49:30,326 --> 00:49:32,828
We had a, this was a very serious storm.

509
00:49:35,382 --> 00:49:42,494
It's very dangerous because cars come clipping by and you're there and you have to just creep out slowly for public safety and just look.

510
00:49:42,694 --> 00:49:43,856
It's very, very dangerous.

511
00:49:46,177 --> 00:49:47,017
There were two issues there.

512
00:49:47,037 --> 00:49:48,878
Now, this is something good the community should know.

513
00:49:48,938 --> 00:49:55,441
Over at the senior center, if you're over 60, they do have a phone number to call, and there's high school kids that come out and help you.

514
00:49:55,921 --> 00:50:00,003
Last year, a couple of guys came out and helped with me, and it was great.

515
00:50:00,543 --> 00:50:08,487
But this year, because City Hall was closed, I got the phone call yesterday, and I said I went out and shoveled on my own.

516
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:11,528
But the woman's very nice, so seniors in the community,

517
00:50:12,148 --> 00:50:16,210
Call the Senior Center, go over there, they have a list of people who will help you shovel.

518
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:20,352
It's a really good resource Medford has, and I think that we should be aware of it.

519
00:50:20,753 --> 00:50:22,073
Thank you very much for what you do.

520
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:24,214
Thank you, citizen.

521
00:50:26,896 --> 00:50:32,459
At this time, the chair would recognize the presence of the President Emeritus in the chamber.

522
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:34,440
Chair recognizes Counsel Marx.

523
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:36,633
Thank you Mr. President.

524
00:50:36,673 --> 00:50:38,194
Just also if we could follow up.

525
00:50:38,894 --> 00:50:46,639
Many of the schools now have safe routes that are part of their schools and how children walk to school in safe areas.

526
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:51,202
And I would ask that whatever is done by the DPW that they also follow

527
00:50:51,602 --> 00:50:58,389
These routes to make sure the intersections and corners are all available to make sure kids can get directly to school.

528
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:07,357
It's great that most of our schools now have been plowed out and many of the intersections directly around the schools look in great condition.

529
00:51:07,777 --> 00:51:10,420
The problem is that not every kid lives next to their school.

530
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:16,285
and they're walking from three, four, five blocks, and that's where the problem lies.

531
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:19,467
Getting to that particular school is where the problem lies.

532
00:51:19,507 --> 00:51:27,354
So I would ask that DPW also look at the safe routes that the schools have, and make sure those areas are plowed out also.

533
00:51:27,894 --> 00:51:34,420
On the motion of Councillor Lungo Kern, amended by Councillors Knight, Councillor Marks, separately,

534
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:43,168
President Caraviello, Councillor Falco and Councillor Scarpelli to end this conversation.

535
00:51:43,508 --> 00:51:45,611
Chair recognizes Councillor Lungo-Kern.

536
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:48,093
Always in a rush.

537
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:50,495
Thank you, Vice President De La Russo.

538
00:51:51,116 --> 00:51:57,803
If I could just, now that Councillor Mox brought this up, I know I emailed the Mayor's office, DPW and

539
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:04,586
Sergeant Hartnett about an issue with Tainter Street and snow removal.

540
00:52:04,806 --> 00:52:09,147
Supposedly, there's a list that's out there with regards to snow removal.

541
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:18,808
So on that note, when it comes to the schools, if maybe we could take a look at those streets and areas that are on the list that are around schools.

542
00:52:19,368 --> 00:52:22,489
I know the seniors are having a hard time getting to the square, too.

543
00:52:22,529 --> 00:52:23,989
That's another complaint I've received.

544
00:52:24,529 --> 00:52:28,850
But with regards to, I was driving my kids to school this morning and got

545
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:32,515
By the crossing guard who had a couple issues and then a couple parents.

546
00:52:33,496 --> 00:52:36,240
So I already emailed about the crossing guards issues.

547
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:44,631
If we could amend this as you're walking into the Roberts, there is a big huge snow pile before so you can't even get into the crosswalk.

548
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:50,976
So if maybe that can be on the removal list and done in the very near future, that would be greatly appreciated.

549
00:52:51,716 --> 00:52:52,657
Thank you, Councillor.

550
00:52:53,718 --> 00:52:59,943
On the motion of Councillor Lungo Kern that the DPW review.

551
00:53:03,497 --> 00:53:10,239
If I may, and I apologize for adding this last minute, but you mentioned snow pile, and that did trigger something.

552
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:27,864
If the snow pile can be removed in the corner of Fern Road and Fulton Spring Road, it's right near a bus stop, and there's a significant amount of snow that I noticed it this morning, and it needs to be removed in the interest of public safety.

553
00:53:29,435 --> 00:53:30,335
Thank you, Counselor.

554
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:51,083
On the motion of Counselor Longo Kern that the DPW review complaints, direct the plows to operate at a slower speed, and that they review the list of snow removal areas to include Tainter Street and the obstructing snow pile at the Roberts School.

555
00:53:52,403 --> 00:54:13,413
that amended by Councillor Knight, that the DPW Director report back to us to explain the standard of snowplows that are engaged by the city for subcontractors, amended by Councillor Marks.

556
00:54:14,313 --> 00:54:40,342
that the corners and sidewalks in the major districts and neighborhoods of the city have the snow reduced for visibility, that the DPW director or the code enforcement officer report to the city council with the number of tickets issued for not shoveling sidewalks and that the DPW follow up on

557
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:55,211
and follow through on the safe paths that students follow on to school as far as snow removal of those avenues.

558
00:54:55,711 --> 00:55:09,242
And that the hotline that is established for complaints and concerns regarding snow be manned 24 hours during the duration of the snow emergency.

559
00:55:09,903 --> 00:55:36,437
It was amended by Council President Carviello that the DPW Commissioner contact the state regarding the quality of snow plowing and the disbursement of snow done by state contractors on the state roads that's now impeding sidewalks and businesses on the state road.

560
00:55:37,698 --> 00:55:43,663
It meant by council Falco to that the DPW director report to the city council.

561
00:55:44,203 --> 00:56:03,199
How many subcontractors are engaged by the city during the storm and the degree to which that they receive training and that the standards that they achieve in the discharge of their duties end.

562
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:13,002
that the DPW Director request and require the removal of snow at the corner of Fern and Fulton Spring.

563
00:56:13,442 --> 00:56:20,385
Finally amended by Councilor Scarpelli that the DPW Director

564
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:48,492
City Council, whether or not there is a list, an operating list within the city that the snow removal foreman engages to make sure that those who are ailing at home receive direct attention as to the quality of the snow plowing at their houses so that they may, in the interest of their safety and security.

565
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:54,122
Thank you.

566
00:56:54,563 --> 00:56:57,765
And if I may, I haven't lost it, have I?

567
00:56:58,545 --> 00:56:59,546
But I am worn out.

568
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:08,812
I would like to point out, if I could, through the chair, if you would indulge me, that I am delighted with the hard work of the DPW.

569
00:57:08,832 --> 00:57:21,840
I'm very grateful to Commissioner Kearns, Foreman Tanaglia, and the various members and division heads within the Department of Public Works for their hard work.

570
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:30,644
Being jarred and banged about in those pieces of equipment is difficult, especially if you're doing it for 30 some odd hours without sleep.

571
00:57:30,904 --> 00:57:31,925
So thank you to you all.

572
00:57:32,345 --> 00:57:36,868
On the motion of approval by Councilor Lango-Curran, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

573
00:57:37,308 --> 00:57:38,348
All those in favor?

574
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:39,849
All those opposed?

575
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,310
The motion is passed.

576
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:42,791
And so ordered.

577
00:57:42,931 --> 00:57:48,776
On the motion of Councillor Knight that we return to the regular order of business.

578
00:57:48,836 --> 00:57:49,617
All those in favour?

579
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:50,798
All those opposed?

580
00:57:51,098 --> 00:57:51,979
The motion granted.

581
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:55,382
18-021 offered by President Caravello.

582
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:59,806
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the Mayor keep the lights on.

583
00:58:00,286 --> 00:58:01,027
Thank you Mr. Vice President.

584
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:04,330
Mr. Vice President, with the opening of Shibuya on New Year's Eve,

585
00:58:25,923 --> 00:58:31,886
And the poor lighting that we have in the square, because I know we're investigating some new lights there.

586
00:58:32,566 --> 00:58:40,030
It'll be my recommendation that the city keep the lights on the trees for the remainder of the time, because...

587
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:55,699
You have all these people walking from the parking lots over here, over to Chevalier, and the lighting on that part of the square is a little questionable and dim at the moment, plus the lights also look nice at Century Bank and at the other end.

588
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:19,836
In the interim, until we replace the lighting on the pole lamps to brighter lights, it'd be my request that the mayor keep the lights on both on the trees of City Hall, Salem Street, and High Street, and also request that Century Bank maybe keep their lights on for the remainder of the season until we get some better lights on the square.

589
00:59:20,376 --> 00:59:20,676
Thank you.

590
00:59:20,736 --> 00:59:25,159
On the motion of Councilor, President Carviello, all those in favor?

591
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:25,780
Councilor Marx?

592
00:59:27,323 --> 00:59:31,731
Mr. President, also maybe if we can make part of this report if the President doesn't mind.

593
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:40,466
We've been waiting for an investigation on the lights in the square for over two years now.

594
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,341
Two years.

595
00:59:42,761 --> 00:59:59,319
They did a section of Salem Street across from Alamo Roast Beef in that area, and they were reviewing the illumination to see if that's what the city wanted to go with, and then the issue fell off the map.

596
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:07,648
I'm not sure what happened, but it really needs, we need an update from the Office of Energy and Environment to find out where we are in this process.

597
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:13,714
There's no reason why it should take two years to figure out what we're going to do with the lighting in the square, Mr. President.

598
01:00:16,997 --> 01:00:24,606
I think this resolution speaks volumes for the fact that we've been waiting to get increased lighting in the business district.

599
01:00:24,906 --> 01:00:36,000
And I might add, not just Meffitt Square, in all our business districts, they all have the same low shabby lights that really illuminate nothing, not even the road, Mr. President.

600
01:00:37,339 --> 01:00:57,324
Mr. Vice President, I was able to speak with the superintendent of Randazzo on the light situation, and he told me that they did have two sample heads that they were going to put up on a couple of lights to see how they work, but he also explained that part of the problem is those poles cannot accommodate

601
01:00:58,883 --> 01:01:03,985
Something with brighter lights because they would have to be fully replaced.

602
01:01:04,485 --> 01:01:11,548
But I don't know if he ever got a chance to put up the two that they had that were at the maximum brightness.

603
01:01:12,009 --> 01:01:15,150
I think it was right after the storm that he got them.

604
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:22,373
So if you want to ask Superintendent Wyeth Randazzo for his report on what happened to those heads.

605
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:33,863
Yes, so that, further amended by Councillor Caviello, that Superintendent Rendazzo report back to us as well on the matter.

606
01:01:34,944 --> 01:01:37,845
Chair recognizes Councillor Knight.

607
01:01:38,185 --> 01:01:39,025
Move the question, Mr. President.

608
01:01:39,365 --> 01:01:40,085
Move the question.

609
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:42,626
Chair recognizes Councillor Lungo-Kern, finally.

610
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:43,026
Thank you.

611
01:01:43,547 --> 01:01:45,547
If we could also just get an update.

612
01:01:45,587 --> 01:01:45,767
Ms.

613
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:50,569
Hunt, I know Alicia Hunt was working on this and helped do the install, asked for our opinion.

614
01:01:50,589 --> 01:01:52,710
I'm not sure where it went, so maybe we could just get an update.

615
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:53,951
I second that.

616
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:54,612
I second that.

617
01:01:54,672 --> 01:01:54,732
Aye.

618
01:02:08,612 --> 01:02:09,333
The ayes have it.

619
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:10,654
Motion passes.

620
01:02:10,734 --> 01:02:12,355
Maybe we should go back to gas lights.

621
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:26,146
And, uh, Senate 18-022, offered by Vice President, uh, Councilor Longo Kern, be resolved that the administration provide Memphis City Council with an update as it relates to the hiring of a traffic engineer.

622
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:27,948
Councilor Longo Kern.

623
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,709
Thank you, Vice President DelaRusso.

624
01:02:31,429 --> 01:02:33,270
This is something we've all been interested in.

625
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:38,833
I put the request that we get an update for this on maybe three months ago.

626
01:02:39,414 --> 01:02:42,595
At that time, I think a couple of my colleagues said yes, it was posted.

627
01:02:43,716 --> 01:02:48,598
Now the residents are starting to ask, those that are concerned with the speed and the traffic.

628
01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:56,122
Residents are starting to ask us and doing their own research, realizing that it's advertised, but not publicly.

629
01:02:56,182 --> 01:02:57,583
I don't know what sites they're looking on,

630
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:05,590
It doesn't seem like we're making any progress, whether or not it's been posted on the city website.

631
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:14,377
I mean, we need to do more to try to get qualified people to apply for this job so we can make it a reality, bottom line.

632
01:03:14,397 --> 01:03:16,919
I mean, it was four months ago I put this on last time.

633
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,062
Councilor Falco's been talking about this since he got elected the first time.

634
01:03:22,123 --> 01:03:23,064
This needs to be done.

635
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:24,145
It was in the budget.

636
01:03:24,845 --> 01:03:25,765
for fiscal year 2018.

637
01:03:25,865 --> 01:03:31,767
We are now six months out and we have nothing and it's just unfortunate.

638
01:03:33,868 --> 01:03:34,488
Councilor Falco.

639
01:03:35,069 --> 01:03:35,849
Thank you Mr. President.

640
01:03:36,569 --> 01:03:37,870
I do agree.

641
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:52,455
I was hoping that this position would have been hired a while ago and I did actually call for an update just because I had been asked by a number of people as well with regard to this issue and what I was told is that it was posted

642
01:03:54,095 --> 01:04:01,823
A number of colleges and universities around here, the MMA as well, and they did interview a number of candidates.

643
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:10,092
From what I was told, an offer was actually made, and last minute, the person actually rejected the offer.

644
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:14,957
They decided not to take it, and this is from what I was told.

645
01:04:16,197 --> 01:04:22,380
So it's going to be reposted again by the end of January, the end of this month.

646
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,721
So that's where we stand.

647
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:33,264
From what I've been told is that basically it will be reposted and they're basically going to start the process again.

648
01:04:33,324 --> 01:04:34,585
That's what I've been told.

649
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:40,888
I definitely feel your frustration because I'm just as frustrated.

650
01:04:40,908 --> 01:04:46,771
I mean, this is something that I've been advocating for since I got on the council, and everyone here is supportive.

651
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:51,013
It's something that's long overdue.

652
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:56,156
It's something that our community needs, and it's something that we need to get today.

653
01:04:56,236 --> 01:05:02,899
So hopefully we get some good candidates in, and hopefully they hire to this position sooner than later.

654
01:05:08,663 --> 01:05:28,778
I still would like just to get a update in writing and maybe amend this and ask for a listing of all places that it will be posted for the second time the end of this month just so we can better tell the people that yes it's getting posted.

655
01:05:29,318 --> 01:05:30,259
It's getting posted.

656
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:55,895
these ten places, and then we can maybe make recommendations, talk to people who are either in the field or who know where it should or shouldn't be posted, and give suggestions to the administration of, hey, why don't we also post it, you know, I mean, I'm not looking for a traffic engineer job, but people may know better places to post it or additional places to post it, because I think if we all work together, maybe we can make it happen.

657
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:59,111
So move approval as amended.

658
01:05:59,131 --> 01:06:03,233
On the motion by Councilman Curran, seconded by Councilor Falco.

659
01:06:03,353 --> 01:06:04,053
All those in favor?

660
01:06:04,314 --> 01:06:04,634
Aye.

661
01:06:05,014 --> 01:06:05,914
Motion passes.

662
01:06:06,235 --> 01:06:06,475
Chief.

663
01:06:08,816 --> 01:06:09,616
Chief, did you want to speak?

664
01:06:15,224 --> 01:06:24,069
I just wanted to thank the council for approving the pay raises for the patrol offices and also the funding, the necessary funding for the patrol offices.

665
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:27,251
I should have got up sooner after that was already done.

666
01:06:27,271 --> 01:06:28,612
You guys are moving it right along.

667
01:06:29,092 --> 01:06:34,315
But I really want to thank you and, you know, unanimous approval goes a long way for all of us.

668
01:06:34,335 --> 01:06:35,436
So I want to thank you for that.

669
01:06:36,056 --> 01:06:48,242
I also want to thank the hard work of Mayor Burke and her staff and the Patrolmen Association under President McGilvery and his e-board for working diligently in reaching an agreement.

670
01:06:48,302 --> 01:06:54,765
So they did work very hard and sometimes those things are overlooked, but thank you again for your approval tonight.

671
01:06:55,366 --> 01:06:55,846
Thank you, Chief.

672
01:07:03,525 --> 01:07:07,470
Mr. Chairman, a motion to take three is under suspension.

673
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:10,032
We have some reports to Ms.

674
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:10,573
Consolidosa.

675
01:07:20,246 --> 01:07:29,514
17590, Method Associates, LLC, Metal Glen Mall, Special Permit, Extended Hours, 60-Day Review, January 9th, 2018, Counselor Night.

676
01:07:30,835 --> 01:07:37,521
Mr. President, this is the extended permit for Wegmans, Mr. President, to allow them to have an opening at 6 a.m.

677
01:07:37,561 --> 01:07:37,922
in the back.

678
01:07:38,562 --> 01:07:43,184
And from what I understand, based upon my conversations with the code enforcement officer, we haven't had any issue.

679
01:07:43,724 --> 01:07:52,147
With that being said, at this point in time, there has been a 60-day review with zero complaints, Mr. President, so I would move to accept the committee report and to move on to the next level of review.

680
01:07:52,767 --> 01:08:02,911
And I do have an email from him saying that, on the motion by Councilor Knife, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

681
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:04,311
All those in favor?

682
01:08:05,192 --> 01:08:06,032
Motion passes.

683
01:08:07,402 --> 01:08:17,445
17433, Annie's Pizzeria, Middlesex Avenue, special permit hours, 180 day review, January 9th, 2019.

684
01:08:18,745 --> 01:08:20,086
Counselor Knight.

685
01:08:21,026 --> 01:08:28,408
Again, Mr. President, this is also a 180 day review of an extended hours permit for a pizzeria on Middlesex Avenue.

686
01:08:28,448 --> 01:08:33,249
It's my understanding that the operation is up and running and there haven't been any complaints or concerns.

687
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:35,510
With that being said, I'd move to accept the committee report.

688
01:08:37,209 --> 01:08:38,830
Second by Councilor DelaRusso.

689
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:42,351
All those in favor?

690
01:08:42,371 --> 01:08:45,892
17-606 Evangelical Haitian Church, 400 High Street.

691
01:08:45,912 --> 01:08:48,673
90-day review on illumination, January 9, 2018.

692
01:08:49,133 --> 01:08:51,134
Councilor Knight.

693
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,214
Mr. President, I'd move to table this matter.

694
01:08:53,234 --> 01:08:57,696
I haven't had an opportunity to speak with the code enforcement officer relative to any complaints that have come in.

695
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:00,877
If I can interject, there is no illuminated sign there as of yet.

696
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,801
If we could table that.

697
01:09:05,662 --> 01:09:08,606
Motion by Councilor Knight to table that, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

698
01:09:09,527 --> 01:09:10,108
All those in favor?

699
01:09:10,669 --> 01:09:11,510
Motion passes.

700
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:18,340
Motion by Councilor Scott Pelley to take papers in the hands of the Clerk, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

701
01:09:22,103 --> 01:09:34,989
Offered by Councillor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Walter Buckley on his election to the position of President of the Memphis Firefighters Local 1032.

702
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,250
Councillor Knight.

703
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:36,970
Mr. President.

704
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:45,339
We've seen Local 1032 have a number of leaders that have come before us, whether it was Rick Jordan or Billy O'Brien, who's passed on the torch now to his former vice president, Walter Edward Buckley.

705
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:51,445
It's a testament to show that the colleagues in the fight department really support and believe in Mr. Buckley.

706
01:09:51,465 --> 01:09:58,132
He's a good Marine, a veteran of our armed forces, and I want to wish him the best of luck and congratulations on this appointment, Mr. President.

707
01:09:58,372 --> 01:09:58,752
Thank you.

708
01:09:59,052 --> 01:09:59,813
Counselor Scott Pelley.

709
01:10:00,553 --> 01:10:01,334
Thank you Mr. President.

710
01:10:01,354 --> 01:10:19,603
I too want to congratulate Mr. Buckley for his appointment and if we can, if my colleague doesn't mind, to also reach out to Bill O'Brien, former president, and thank him for all the hard work he put into such a difficult and demanding position.

711
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:20,263
So thank you.

712
01:10:20,824 --> 01:10:21,184
Thank you.

713
01:10:21,964 --> 01:10:24,866
On the motion by Counselor Knight, seconded by Counselor Scott Pelley.

714
01:10:24,886 --> 01:10:25,606
All those in favor?

715
01:10:25,886 --> 01:10:25,966
Aye.

716
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:27,207
Motion passes.

717
01:10:29,168 --> 01:10:30,829
Be offered by Councilor Knight.

718
01:10:31,489 --> 01:10:32,310
Be resolved.

719
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:40,454
The Memphis City Council congratulate Michael Lukovic on his recent election to the position of Vice President of Memphis Firefighters Local 1032.

720
01:10:41,854 --> 01:10:42,835
Councilor Knight.

721
01:10:42,995 --> 01:10:43,855
Yes, Mr. President.

722
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:46,197
Councilor Lando Kerr was actually supposed to be on that as well.

723
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:49,238
Again, there's been a change in leadership at 1032.

724
01:10:50,078 --> 01:10:51,799
Vice President Buckley is now the President.

725
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:55,981
That opened up the Vice Presidency seat and Mr. Lukovic has gotten there.

726
01:10:56,141 --> 01:10:56,682
Also another

727
01:10:57,422 --> 01:11:04,409
Strong veteran of our United States military, Mr. President, a great gentleman, and this is just a testament to the work that he does and the opinion that his colleagues have of him.

728
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:06,311
So I'd like to congratulate him on his work.

729
01:11:06,351 --> 01:11:07,732
He's a great firefighter and a great person.

730
01:11:08,513 --> 01:11:12,656
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelly.

731
01:11:12,716 --> 01:11:14,158
All those in favor?

732
01:11:14,598 --> 01:11:14,678
Aye.

733
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:16,040
Motion passes.

734
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:31,363
Offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the Code Enforcement Officer enforce the Snow Removal Ordinance at the Dunkin' Donuts on High Street and Brandon Avenue.

735
01:11:31,423 --> 01:11:32,063
Councilor Knight.

736
01:11:35,389 --> 01:11:37,570
I'll have it at him, sorry.

737
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:59,145
Yes, Mr. President, Councilor Falco and I have been approached by a number of constituents and residents in the neighborhood that have concerns, especially when dusk falls, that the sidewalk is very difficult to traverse and it's causing a public safety hazard, so we'd like to ask that the code enforcement officer go down there and do an inspection and speak with the individuals that are responsible for snow removal at the property.

738
01:11:59,165 --> 01:12:01,466
The motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

739
01:12:01,506 --> 01:12:02,287
All those in favor?

740
01:12:02,607 --> 01:12:02,707
Aye.

741
01:12:02,927 --> 01:12:03,828
Motion passes.

742
01:12:05,382 --> 01:12:17,078
Offered by Council of Mox, being resolved that the City Administration provide the Council with an update on the status of the turnout gear, purchase of heavy-duty dryers, and the training councils.

743
01:12:17,118 --> 01:12:17,699
Council of Mox.

744
01:12:19,124 --> 01:12:20,205
Thank you, Mr. President.

745
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:32,794
The turnout gear, which we all thought brave men and women in the fire department are wearing, they still have yet to get their second suit of turnout gear.

746
01:12:33,835 --> 01:12:35,937
I'm not quite sure what the holdup is, but I'm asking.

747
01:12:36,397 --> 01:12:46,388
That the city administration report back immediately on what is the time frame for the firefighters to receive the gear regarding the training towers.

748
01:12:47,109 --> 01:12:53,275
I know there's meetings going along between the city administration, the fire department and other.

749
01:12:54,977 --> 01:13:04,962
I think it's only appropriate that we get an update now on where we stand regarding the training towers and the dryers.

750
01:13:05,963 --> 01:13:11,666
From what I've been told today, they are not ordering dryers for the turnout gear.

751
01:13:11,706 --> 01:13:16,529
They ordered washers, which we all spoke about within the budget.

752
01:13:17,409 --> 01:13:32,736
We all asked that dryers be purchased also to be installed at the headquarters and now being told that they are not ordering the dryers, they are going to just have them held up and blown dry by fans.

753
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:42,643
Which to me seems kind of outdated and archaic way of drying turnout gear, which is a very piece, heavy piece of clothing.

754
01:13:43,363 --> 01:13:53,330
And to me proper drying would be through a recognized heavy duty dryer that's used throughout this country in fire stations.

755
01:13:53,750 --> 01:14:11,922
So I would ask Mr. President that we receive an update why dryers, after a vote of this council, in funding that was approved by this council, uh, dryers have not been, uh, purchased, and from what I'm being told, are not going to be purchased, Mr. President, uh, from this, uh, city administration.

756
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:19,847
On the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor Knight.

757
01:14:19,907 --> 01:14:20,548
All those in favor?

758
01:14:22,143 --> 01:14:22,824
All those in favor?

759
01:14:23,705 --> 01:14:24,606
Motion passes.

760
01:14:27,228 --> 01:14:37,178
Offered by Councilor Marks be it resolved that the tree at 91 Warren Street be removed by National Grid in the interest of public safety.

761
01:14:37,838 --> 01:14:38,559
Councilor Marks.

762
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,581
Thank you Mr. President.

763
01:14:40,641 --> 01:14:45,545
The resident that lives at 91 Warren Street brought this tree which is

764
01:14:47,727 --> 01:14:54,491
...in terrible condition to the attention of the city warden, Aggie Tudin, back in January of 2017.

765
01:14:55,031 --> 01:15:12,660
Aggie Tudin went out, looked at the tree, said, indeed, this tree needs to come down as a public safety concern... ...and where there are electrical wires that are mixed in with the branches of the tree, it's protocol by the tree warden...

766
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:26,645
to reach out to National Grid, which Aggie Tudin reached out in January to National Grid of 2017, requesting that they go out and remove the tree in the interest of public safety.

767
01:15:27,325 --> 01:15:28,966
Nothing was done, Mr. President.

768
01:15:29,406 --> 01:15:35,828
In August 10, 2017, Aggie Tudin then reached out to National Grid again.

769
01:15:36,568 --> 01:15:38,209
This tree is of concern.

770
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:42,772
It's in the neighborhood and it needs to be addressed by National Grid.

771
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:44,733
National Grid did nothing again.

772
01:15:45,293 --> 01:15:57,980
And just recently in December of last year, Aggie reached out for a third time to National Grid and they have yet to respond, Mr. President, or yet to reach out.

773
01:16:00,401 --> 01:16:18,629
I would ask Mr. President that we immediately send a letter to National Grid, and I can tell you as one member of the Council, I'm getting tired of these utility companies, and I know Councilor Scott Pelly has spoken about it on many occasions, Mr. President.

774
01:16:19,009 --> 01:16:20,791
running roughshod in this community.

775
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:32,762
And when we have a request, a public safety request to ignore it for a year, in my opinion, coming from a department head here at City Hall is unacceptable.

776
01:16:33,643 --> 01:16:34,804
It's totally unacceptable.

777
01:16:35,185 --> 01:16:43,833
And I can tell you right now, any petitioner that comes before us, in particular for National Grid, they're not going to get my vote on, I don't care what the proposals are.

778
01:16:44,253 --> 01:16:47,578
until they start addressing issues in this community, Mr. President.

779
01:16:47,959 --> 01:16:53,807
We asked for a report regarding the double polls in the community several months back.

780
01:16:54,268 --> 01:16:57,593
Has anyone received a report regarding double polls in this community?

781
01:16:58,114 --> 01:16:58,655
Nothing at all.

782
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:12,086
We have received little to no correspondence at all, Mr. President, and I think it's about time this council stands up on behalf of the residents of this community and the people that are paying the bills.

783
01:17:12,726 --> 01:17:21,633
National Grid's making a lot of money in this community, along with the other utility companies, and it's about time that this council stands up on behalf of the residents.

784
01:17:22,234 --> 01:17:28,519
And I would ask that that treaty be reviewed and taken down immediately, Mr. President, where it's a year-old request.

785
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:34,443
and the tree water deemed appropriate that that tree needs to be removed immediately in the interest of public safety.

786
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:35,804
Thank you, Councilman.

787
01:17:37,365 --> 01:17:40,908
On the motion by Councilman Mox, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

788
01:17:41,608 --> 01:17:42,269
All those in favor?

789
01:17:42,609 --> 01:17:43,089
Aye.

790
01:17:43,129 --> 01:17:44,070
Motion passes.

791
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:47,813
We have several condolences this evening.

792
01:17:51,758 --> 01:17:56,543
So if we could do them all at once, it would be appreciated.

793
01:17:58,164 --> 01:18:08,013
Offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for longtime Method resident Francis Martin Jr.

794
01:18:08,634 --> 01:18:10,215
on his recent passing.

795
01:18:11,096 --> 01:18:11,677
Councilor Mox.

796
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:15,470
Thank you, Mr. President.

797
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:26,673
Francis is a lifelong resident and was a great community person, a great friend, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

798
01:18:27,493 --> 01:18:27,893
Thank you.

799
01:18:28,734 --> 01:18:42,657
Offered by Councilor Knight, President Caraviello, and Councilor Falco, we are resolved that the Memphis City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Karen Pirro on her recent passing.

800
01:18:42,737 --> 01:18:43,397
Councilor Knight.

801
01:18:44,899 --> 01:18:46,280
Mr. President, thank you very much.

802
01:18:47,021 --> 01:18:49,364
Karen Piero was a family friend for a very long time.

803
01:18:49,944 --> 01:18:53,248
She grew up next door to my aunt in the city of Somerville.

804
01:18:53,388 --> 01:18:56,572
Vinnie, her husband, and my father were very good friends, go back a number of years.

805
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:03,560
The first political campaign I ever worked on was when I was seven years old, holding signs for Vinnie Piero and going door-to-door with my father, Vinnie Piero, Mr. President.

806
01:19:04,601 --> 01:19:07,802
over the years had an opportunity to meet Karen and develop a relationship with her.

807
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:09,502
And I'm very sad to see her go.

808
01:19:09,522 --> 01:19:10,302
She was a great woman.

809
01:19:10,322 --> 01:19:11,863
She was a strong family person.

810
01:19:12,203 --> 01:19:14,123
And she raised a great family, Mr. President.

811
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:19,744
She was always the rock behind Representative Pirro's efforts in the legislature.

812
01:19:19,944 --> 01:19:22,965
And I'm just sad to see her go, Mr. President.

813
01:19:23,045 --> 01:19:24,065
It's really a terrible loss.

814
01:19:24,165 --> 01:19:25,546
And she was struggling for a long time.

815
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:26,626
She was ill for a long time.

816
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:31,107
And during this time in the holidays, I'd just like to extend the deepest condolences to her family.

817
01:19:32,763 --> 01:19:33,104
Thank you.

818
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:41,637
And again, the Peros have been long-time friends of myself and my family, and it's tough to lose a loved one on the holiday time.

819
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:53,378
Offered by President Caraviello and by Councilor Knight.

820
01:19:53,458 --> 01:20:03,126
Being resolved, the Memphis City Council sends its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Colleen Hallisey, owner of Colleen's.

821
01:20:04,227 --> 01:20:10,111
Colleen was an icon of Memphis Square and her presence in our community is going to be sorely missed.

822
01:20:10,131 --> 01:20:10,732
Councilor Knight.

823
01:20:11,392 --> 01:20:12,753
Mr. President, thank you very much.

824
01:20:13,633 --> 01:20:16,194
I can remember Colleen for as long as I can remember.

825
01:20:16,915 --> 01:20:22,557
She was a fixture at the Brigham's on the corner of Forest Street and High Street, which later became Colleen's.

826
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:28,580
She did a great job turning that business around from some frailing franchise into a private endeavor that was really booming.

827
01:20:29,641 --> 01:20:38,425
Thinking back to all my encounters with her and remembering how many of my friends all had jobs there through high school and how much free ice cream I got from them.

828
01:20:38,825 --> 01:20:41,287
She brings back some great memories, Mr. President.

829
01:20:41,347 --> 01:20:43,509
But you weren't pulling the wool over Colleen's eyes.

830
01:20:43,529 --> 01:20:45,090
She knew everything that was going on in her shop.

831
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:50,375
And if she saw a kid over there that needed a little bit of help or an extra scoop of ice cream to make his day, she was all for it.

832
01:20:50,435 --> 01:20:54,498
So with that being said, Mr. President, I extend my condolences to her family on her untimely passing.

833
01:20:54,518 --> 01:21:01,024
She had a very public illness, and it's something that she showed courage and poised through.

834
01:21:01,404 --> 01:21:04,767
And I really just want to extend my deepest condolences to her family.

835
01:21:05,788 --> 01:21:11,451
The great president of Colleen, very active in the Chamber of Commerce and the community, St.

836
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:16,935
Joseph's Church, I mean, you know, anybody needed anything, Colleen was the first to step forward.

837
01:21:16,975 --> 01:21:29,582
Donations, the use of her restaurant, and again, certainly one of the longtime icons of Memphis Square, and her presence will be missed in our community.

838
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:32,204
Eighteen.

839
01:21:33,570 --> 01:22:02,462
uh... offered by president caribbean will be a result of the city council so this is also is the family of dr detector for the long-time volunteer uh... was of the communities that was very active in our community and her presence in the west of the community is going to be missed by many again uh... guardian another another icon of west medford uh... all the time and i'll spend the rest of the community center uh... people like that just uh... just don't get replaced so again uh...

840
01:22:04,422 --> 01:22:05,702
My condolences to her and her family.

841
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:08,963
And if we could all stand for a moment of silence.

842
01:22:20,205 --> 01:22:20,585
Thank you.

843
01:22:20,605 --> 01:22:22,366
Mr. President.

844
01:22:22,386 --> 01:22:23,006
Dr. Del Russo.

845
01:22:23,086 --> 01:22:32,628
Before we adjourn, if I could invite a citizen who wishes to speak and share a discourse on the recycling scheduling.

846
01:22:34,395 --> 01:22:34,755
Thank you.

847
01:22:36,676 --> 01:22:37,136
Good evening.

848
01:22:37,176 --> 01:22:38,316
Name and address of the record, please.

849
01:22:38,597 --> 01:22:43,218
Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Eastford.

850
01:22:44,879 --> 01:22:50,041
First of all, I wish you all a very good, healthy New Year to everyone, sincerely.

851
01:22:51,857 --> 01:23:06,227
I came in this evening earlier, and downstairs I noticed this one-page flyer at the information booth table, and it jarred my memory, because I don't recollect

852
01:23:07,047 --> 01:23:12,552
If I ever receive this year's recycling brochure schedule.

853
01:23:13,273 --> 01:23:16,076
So if any of the counselors know the answer, I'd appreciate it.

854
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:20,079
Or else I'll have to go through some old mail and see if I misfiled it.

855
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:27,726
I would like to know that for the sake of better disposal for, especially for the absentee owners that live on my street.

856
01:23:27,826 --> 01:23:28,127
Thank you.

857
01:23:29,145 --> 01:23:30,328
Thank you, Mr. Casagnetti.

858
01:23:30,668 --> 01:23:32,572
Does anyone know the answer?

859
01:23:32,913 --> 01:23:36,560
We do not know the answer, but we'll do our best to find it out for you.

860
01:23:41,938 --> 01:23:53,349
I'm sorry it's not in form and I'd be happy to write a resolution, but I'd like to also request that the administration investigate extending Christmas tree pickup for another week or so based upon the inclement weather that's outside.

861
01:23:53,950 --> 01:24:01,678
I think it might be a good gesture to allow some people some time to get their driveways and sidewalks cleared away before they get their trees out of the house.

862
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:14,494
On the motion by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Falco, that the administration investigate more time for the Christmas trees to be picked up.

863
01:24:14,614 --> 01:24:15,294
All those in favour?

864
01:24:16,035 --> 01:24:16,835
Motion passes.

865
01:24:18,665 --> 01:24:19,085
Ricketts.

866
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:21,567
Ricketts.

867
01:24:22,327 --> 01:24:22,967
Councilor Marks.

868
01:24:23,788 --> 01:24:24,448
Yes, Mr. President.

869
01:24:24,468 --> 01:24:33,974
Just briefly, we all received an email today regarding the broadcast equipment that's located here at City Hall and how outdated the equipment is.

870
01:24:34,734 --> 01:24:39,937
And the new gentleman, his name escapes me, that's operating, Ben,

871
01:24:41,998 --> 01:24:50,262
The community access station put together some figures and facts on what equipment we need and the cost.

872
01:24:50,923 --> 01:25:02,528
This would also include the equipment that this council supported regarding having cameras televise our hearing rooms and be part of that process.

873
01:25:03,149 --> 01:25:09,292
And I would ask that we as a council request the city administration submit to us a funding paper.

874
01:25:10,052 --> 01:25:28,299
So we can move forward on these two very important issues, changing the outdated equipment here at City Hall, so people viewing this can actually make heads and tails of what's going on at this meeting, and also the meetings that are taking place in other rooms that are currently on televised, Mr. President.

875
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:33,221
So I would ask that we send a correspondence to the Mayor for a funding paper.

876
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:43,759
I just want to second this resolve the email we received I think was forwarded to us by the city clerk from Ben Brown.

877
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:48,542
It broke down all the information that we need with regards to cost for new equipment.

878
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:49,883
It's one of them.

879
01:25:51,203 --> 01:26:00,991
Complaints we get of how this meeting is airing, school committee, as well as the fact that we would like more boards and commissions and more of our meetings televised for the public.

880
01:26:02,152 --> 01:26:03,593
We need a new system.

881
01:26:03,653 --> 01:26:04,974
We need cameras in the

882
01:26:06,676 --> 01:26:32,215
different rooms in City Hall, one or two additional rooms, and I think it coincides with the funding we appropriated in the last budget with regards to videotaping and online, whether that was online streaming, I don't know exactly, but more transparency, the public's ability to watch and review documents and watch the meetings, it's extremely important, and I think it's something that is

883
01:26:32,435 --> 01:26:39,916
It's long overdue, so I second the resolve and hopefully we can move forward on that quickly along with the traffic engineer.

884
01:26:41,728 --> 01:26:42,528
Thank you, Mr. President.

885
01:26:42,608 --> 01:26:43,989
I also support this resolution.

886
01:26:44,029 --> 01:26:51,115
I think this is one of the key points in making the legislative software program successful.

887
01:26:51,155 --> 01:26:58,081
We need to make sure that we have funding to buy the latest equipment to have in the meeting rooms and here at City Hall.

888
01:26:58,761 --> 01:27:05,227
I think it promotes engagement with the citizens and making sure that they can see what happens here.

889
01:27:05,768 --> 01:27:08,954
Not only in this meeting, but with the boards and commissions as well.

890
01:27:09,415 --> 01:27:11,840
So I just want to go on record of supporting this.

891
01:27:11,901 --> 01:27:12,201
Thank you.

892
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:17,712
All those in favor.

893
01:27:17,972 --> 01:27:18,412
Aye.

894
01:27:18,512 --> 01:27:19,433
Motion passes.

895
01:27:20,494 --> 01:27:20,874
Records.

896
01:27:22,056 --> 01:27:23,557
Pass the councilor Scott Pelly.

897
01:27:29,262 --> 01:27:31,704
