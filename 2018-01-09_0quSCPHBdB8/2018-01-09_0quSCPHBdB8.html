    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=170.722s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=172.143s">Second</a>  regular meeting of the Medford City Council, January 9th, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=177.625s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=179.987s">Councilor</a>  De La Ruza. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=181.908s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=183.929s">Vice</a>  President De La Ruza. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=185.849s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=188.431s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=190.392s">Councilor</a>  Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=191.792s">Councilor</a>  Marx. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=194.012s">Mr.</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=194.933s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=195.713s">President</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=197.014s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=198.154s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=200.256s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=214.115s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Lungo-Koehn for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=217.456s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scott Felly. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=219.016s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=220.477s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=221.797s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=223.177s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=224.818s">Paper</a>  18-023. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=230.199s">We</a>  have our city solicitor here.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=232.06s">18-023</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=235.241s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council go into executive session to discuss personal matters with the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=242.703s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=244.634s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=247.676s">My</a>  name is Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=248.676s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=249.677s">I</a>  reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=252.719s">I</a>  read the resolution the other day in the snow, but I want to say something at the beginning before we entertain it, and I'm sure you'll understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=261.243s">I</a>  have no difficulty, nor does anyone else, discussing any personnel issue in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=268.537s">If</a>  the point of the resolution is about a specific individual, and I understand if it is, then the open meeting law would require that that person get notice that we're going to be discussing her or him. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=283.007s">And</a>  then they'd have also the ability to attend the executive session personally and with a representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=290.352s">Now,</a>  I know that that sounds a little bit, it almost sounds like, well, that's putting a hurdle into the way of discussing it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=296.881s">But</a>  if it is about a particular individual, then those procedural requirements of the open meeting law need to be followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=304.671s">And</a>  I'm very, very sure of this opinion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=309.19s">So</a>  if we're discussing in general anybody, any prior personnel that has or will be potentially suing the city, then that would be named specifically, each of them would have to be notified?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=323.184s">Yes,</a>  even if that weren't the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=325.165s">For</a>  example, I don't know, I have not received notice of anybody suing the city about anything of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=332.152s">In</a>  this general body of law, however, the statute which is Massachusetts general law chapter 38 section 21 says that if an individual is going to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=347.686s">In</a>  executive session, they're entitled to notice of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=350.487s">So</a>  they can attend and attend with a representative if they choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=354.689s">If</a>  that were, if it is about a particular personnel incident that relates to an individual, then we really should follow that in order to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=364.033s">And</a>  I have no difficulty with that, but I want, and I encourage the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=368.855s">to</a>  follow that procedural requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=370.896s">So</a>  if it's about a certain person, then notice would have to be given to them 48 hours before the meeting, and they would have a right to attend if they so chose. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=381.721s">So</a>  I just want to put that caveat out, which it's a point that doesn't always jump off the page when you think about discussion in executive session, but it is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=391.325s">So</a>  if anybody needs it better explained, I'll try. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=398.146s">I</a>  don't understand the moment.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=406.545s">I</a>  would like to discuss the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=408.106s">I</a>  don't know how my colleagues feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=409.787s">It</a>  is specifically, I mean, in general, I had some questions, but it sounds like there may not be any. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=419.114s">Well,</a>  I think we need to notify the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=420.816s">I</a>  mean, there is one specific person that has been fired.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=423.858s">There</a>  has to be a purpose for a moment in the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=427.641s">We'll</a>  take a five minute recess.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=432.864s">I</a>  have no difficulty speaking with the Councilor on the side to go over this in a little bit more depth, but I think she understands.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=438.825s">As</a>  a new member and this being the first time this came across to this issue came across to myself and how do we normally I know that in <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=459.71s">With</a>  the school committee, we handle different situations a little bit differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=463.194s">Do</a>  we often, have we done this in the past?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=465.997s">We've</a>  talked to personnel matters and executive session with... If you're going to discuss a particular person or an incident that relates to a particular person, it is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=475.606s">The</a>  answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=476.687s">I've</a>  been here 34 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=478.489s">It's</a>  been a while since I've seen this discussed in executive session, but it has. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=482.713s">Sometimes</a>  I believe in the school department, although I'm not the school department's attorney, when there are discipline matters or instances of faculty that are coming up about a particular faculty member, they would get notice, and I'm sure that the superintendent is well aware of what those requirements are. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=500.697s">And</a>  as I say, this is not a matter of saying nobody wants to discuss anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=504.518s">I</a>  want the procedural requirements followed if this is about a specific person and a personnel incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=512.321s">And</a>  I think that that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=514.182s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=514.742s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=516.783s">I</a>  think it would be helpful maybe if the sponsor of the resolution could kind of explain to us what exactly it is we're trying to accomplish here, what the situation is, and maybe we can go from there and figure out what direction we're going to go in.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=527.851s">Mr.</a>  President, yes, I need the same clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=532.432s">The</a>  resolution seems vague to me, and if I might add that I'm of the opinion that personnel matters regarding specific personnel, as far as our authority in those matters is known. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=549.417s">It's</a>  not under our purview, Mr. President, and one would wonder if it could be considered out of order.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=558.062s">Maybe,</a>  let's see, I make the suggestion that we have a caucus in a couple of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=563.024s">On</a>  what issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=563.665s">To</a>  make sure that we're going in the right direction.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=566.046s">I'm</a>  telling you that if we're going to discuss a particular person, you're going in the wrong direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=570.768s">Well,</a>  let's caucus for two minutes and see what the issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=573.59s">Right,</a>  so in order to caucus, if what you're saying, Mr. President, is you want to go into executive session to caucus, <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=579.813s">About</a>  what?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=580.454s">We're</a>  going to have a two-minute recess to discuss this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=584.858s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=586.099s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=596.38s">You</a>  just can't discuss names. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=599.143s">We</a>  can discuss anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=601.244s">No,</a>  you cannot discuss names. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=603.887s">On</a>  the record, you cannot discuss anything in Executive Session just by going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=607.991s">What</a>  is the purpose of going in? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=609.432s">We're</a>  not going to Executive Session. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=610.453s">We</a>  have a caucus. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=611.174s">So</a>  what's a caucus? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=613.065s">I</a>  leave it to the chair to unravel this procedural quagmire. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=673.745s">Thank</a>  you for watching.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=742.958s">I'm</a>  going to get a bit of an inside conversation about this violation of law right now.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=859.068s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=860.989s">I'm</a>  just going to put a motion forward that we have a committee at the home meeting next Tuesday night, whether that be 6.30, 6.45, and invite this prior employee to be present.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=874.174s">6.30.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=874.234s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=882.006s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=882.506s">So</a>  we're inviting them to a committee of the whole, as opposed to going into executive session?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=887.207s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=887.427s">Okay,</a>  no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=889.307s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=891.208s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=892.928s">Is</a>  the solicitor still available? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=897.309s">I</a>  think we'll invite him. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=899.809s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=900.669s">Is</a>  he here at present? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=901.55s">He</a>  is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=902.17s">If</a>  I can, through the Chair, Mr. President, ask the solicitor what authority the City Council has over personnel matters.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=911.658s">The</a>  authority in the sense of immediate jurisdiction, discretionary jurisdiction, the ability to make personnel decisions? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=919.424s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=920.284s">None.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1455.354s">Councilman,</a>  it's my understanding that the waiving of the three readings must be unanimous by the body, so it's not necessarily a policy of this council, but it was one individual council that didn't feel as though waiving the readings was appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1464.556s">With</a>  that being said, I feel as though the plight of the police department has been quite open and quite transparent over the past several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1469.837s">They've</a>  made us very aware of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1471.958s">However,</a>  with that being said, if we don't have the support of the council, we don't have the right to waive the three readings, so I withdraw my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1479.24s">Mr.</a>  Clerk.</p>

    <p>[uOl8IpBqQPs_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1723.641s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1724.802s">My</a>  name is Ronald Paone. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1726.303s">I</a>  live on 314 Winthrop Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1729.738s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President and councillors for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1732.739s">This</a>  will be my second journey up to this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1735.379s">I</a>  came here last year when the fire department and the police department were doing their thing and I didn't get called in until about 9.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1742.741s">Anyway,</a>  I'm having the same issue as I did last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1746.182s">We</a>  have city trucks that are being operated by individuals who really <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1753.724s">They're</a>  not really doing their job, and I'm sorry to complain about this, but before I get to the issue about where I live, I have an only sister who lives on Lewis Street in Medford, which is off of Fulton Street, and that street is deplorable, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1771.259s">During</a>  the ice storm, they didn't even come down and salt it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1774.68s">Uh,</a>  there was supposed to be, uh, parking just on the right, and that street was, you know, both sides were filled with cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1782.263s">So</a>  those city plows didn't have an opportunity to get down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1784.524s">Now,</a>  if anybody's ever been on that street, you really can't even navigate if you even try to get down there with a UPS truck or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1791.387s">I'm</a>  not even talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1792.327s">I'm</a>  just talking about regular people going down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1794.928s">And</a>  Lewis Street, it's off Fulton. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1797.989s">Okay,</a>  I just wanted to mention that because, again, that's my elderly sister, and, you know, I kind of have to watch out for her once in a while, you know, she slip and fall, that kind of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1807.934s">Anyway,</a>  now the issue with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1811.015s">My</a>  driveway, I have 110 foot from the street to the garage in the back, 110 feet straight in, and then I have about 60 feet to the right if you're facing the house, so it's probably about 1,500 to 2,000 square feet of pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1828.104s">And</a>  I have to do a lot of work there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1831.126s">As</a>  the city drivers come by on the snow days, they're pushing the snow and they're doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1839.031s">When</a>  they get near that end of Winthrop Street, they're usually about a foot to two feet away from the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1846.375s">And</a>  it continues and continues and continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1848.476s">And</a>  as we, you know, the storm is breaking and slowing down and whatever, and they're wrapping up for the night, it's usually still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1857.278s">So</a>  what I usually do is I go out and I get in my, I have a bobcat and I go out in the front and I get the snow close to the curb and I stockpile it and I flatten it down so it's not too high, the banks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1870.501s">Council</a>  and I could have tested that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1871.821s">He</a>  sees that I keep my property up, up, up, up, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1875.843s">And,</a>  uh, so it was, uh, Thursday night after the storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1879.764s">I</a>  wrapped up around 10, went in the house, took a shower, went to sleep around 12, 1 o'clock, hear a big bang, jump out of bed, go outside, and there's cascaded snow over the bank onto the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1894.949s">Again,</a>  I'm talking chunks of snow, and there's about <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1899.11s">Six</a>  inches of just ice and snow buried in front of my driveway now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1903.892s">The</a>  driveway next to me is a Butman. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1906.233s">It's</a>  the elderly nursing home. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1908.694s">So</a>  I have a good rapport with the woman there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1911.355s">And</a>  I had to open it up because her plow driver had already gone home for the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1915.376s">So</a>  her employees would never have been able to get on the 7 o'clock shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1918.897s">So</a>  I opened her up also. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1921.793s">It</a>  was just a real bad night. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1923.294s">And</a>  this is not the first time this has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1925.916s">Uh,</a>  the ice storm that I previously mentioned beforehand, two storms ago, uh, where we got the inch, uh, the inch and a half of ice. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1933.261s">Uh,</a>  one of this, I observed at 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1936.122s">in</a>  the morning on that particular day, I think it was a Saturday, that the, the ice storm happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1941.166s">Uh,</a>  a city truck, it was a 28,000 pound truck, one of the big dump trucks with a 10 foot plow and a salter. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1948.43s">Goin'</a>  up and down Winthrop Street from Lawrence Road to the Circle, and there's this big bump in the middle of the street, he bottomed out as he went over it, so he was moving at an excessive speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1959.138s">And</a>  he was just salting, he wasn't plowing, he was just salting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1962.2s">And</a>  I watched him as I stepped outside as he... <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1964.401s">went</a>  around the rotary and came back going towards Lawrence Road at excessive speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1968.485s">So</a>  now, proper speed for any type of equipment should be anywhere between 5 and 10 miles an hour, and that's a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1975.271s">Okay,</a>  I've been in this business for over four decades, so I know what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1980.796s">This</a>  is not my personal opinion, but you know, I believe that the city taxpayers pay for this equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1987.196s">If</a>  I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1988.777s">And</a>  I, you know, I would think that there would be a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1992.098s">And</a>  I get that, you know, I know about blood money. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1995.06s">You're</a>  out in the snow storms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1996.22s">You're</a>  doing a lot of hours worth of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1997.821s">You</a>  just want to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1998.982s">You</a>  want to get home. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=1999.682s">I</a>  get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2000.682s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2001.343s">But,</a>  you know, sometimes you got to, like, understand that, like, you can't be doing, you know, hurting others, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2008.166s">And</a>  this incident happened last year where the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2011.267s">They</a>  hit the snow bank in front of the house and cascaded the snow onto the sidewalk, and I just wrapped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2017.646s">I</a>  don't like to pay for real estate twice, if anybody can understand that expression. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2020.933s">I</a>  don't like to do jobs twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2022.155s">I</a>  just, I want to get it done, I want to stop, and that's the end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2027.818s">You</a>  know, my fear is that, and this is not even a personal fear, is that maybe, you know, there could be a dog or something crossing the street, or a stray cat, and, you know, the guy's driving by doing 30 miles an hour, hits one of them, or even a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2040.408s">We</a>  got a lot of people that are out in that hour, and I see it at 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2044.392s">in</a>  the morning, they're crossing streets and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2046.253s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2047.714s">And,</a>  you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2048.575s">I</a>  don't know what's going on, but, you know, I think it should be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2052.497s">I'm</a>  really a little frustrated, because, like, we still got a whole couple more months of maybe more snow, and I don't want to have to, like, come back up here and complain. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2062.721s">And</a>  it's not, again, I'm not, do not want to see anybody lose their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2066.963s">I</a>  believe that the city is full of good employees that take pride in their jobs, and I'm not looking to put a hammer on anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2075.385s">I</a>  mentioned at 11 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2077.286s">Friday</a>  morning, I called the mayor's office and I said, I'd like to make a complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2082.407s">And</a>  the person that was on the other end said, <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2085.539s">We're</a>  not taking complaints today, and then my phone went dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2088.182s">Now,</a>  I have this old phone, if anybody wants to see it, it's old, and maybe it was my phone that might have disconnected, but all of a sudden, the line went dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2094.929s">So,</a>  I didn't call back. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2096.831s">I</a>  said, let me address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2099.405s">to</a>  this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2099.925s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2101.126s">If</a>  you can do anything to help, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2103.207s">I</a>  mean, this is something that I think should be addressed by you guys, you know, and Brianna. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2109.612s">And</a>  let me tell you, I mean, I'm probably not the only resident that could come up here and start complaining about, you know, the services of, you know, the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2117.317s">But</a>  these are just incidences that I don't like to have to, you know, continue to come up here and talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2122.5s">You</a>  know, I mean, I've been making amends to this city for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2127.383s">Thirty</a>  years from all the trouble that I caused back in the seventies and early eighties, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2132.909s">So</a>  I'm trying to be a nice guy.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2135.331s">You</a>  are forgiven.</p>

    <p>[uOl8IpBqQPs_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2136.433s">I'm</a>  trying to be a nice guy, but I'm also human, and I also have that Italian temper. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2143.64s">Chief</a>  Sackle can attest to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2145.662s">So,</a>  you know, I'm glad everybody's chuckling, but you know, I can laugh at myself these days, you know, and again, if anything you guys could do for me, I would greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2154.189s">Please,</a>  I'm not looking to fight, get anybody fired, but just maybe pass the word down so somebody has observation on their, you know, who's ever supervising this operation.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2163.936s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2164.697s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2166.95s">I</a>  think we've all got a number of complaints a number of.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2182.052s">Good</a>  words and obviously the complaints are the ones we get the most and we've got a number of complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2186.415s">I</a>  think this is Winthrop Street where sidewalk was reblocked after, you know, taking probably hours to shovel it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2194.44s">I</a>  think we also got a couple from High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2197.222s">I've</a>  got complaints about tainter and I think we're trying to, I'm trying to myself, <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2202.545s">email.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2202.985s">I</a>  know Sergeant Hartnett and Lauren from the mayor's office is fielding a number of complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2209.408s">This</a>  is one I haven't reached out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2211.048s">I</a>  know you potentially were coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2213.069s">So</a>  I think that we need to just get a check on whoever is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2219.071s">This</a>  is the second complaint I got with regards to Winthrop Street and just the plow driver driving extremely fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2224.953s">And</a>  I think that may be where the problem is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2226.954s">They're</a>  going too fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2227.895s">They're</a>  not doing it, you know, obviously properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2230.556s">So</a>  maybe if we could <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2231.856s">just</a>  send that off to our DPW to take a look at where the complaints are coming from and who's actually doing those routes if it's in-house or if I know we have a lot of contractors this was the first storm it was a huge storm we got over a foot of snow and it was it was hard for anybody to keep up the residents the DPW a lot of streets were done great but yes we're getting the complaints we we aren't Somerville I think we've got pitches tonight of Somerville streets and no we're not Somerville we did <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2260.858s">City</a>  did purchase a nice piece of equipment that's going to help us with our sidewalks but it's not in yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2265.982s">So</a>  there are improvements that need to be made and hopefully we can learn from this current storm and move to make sure that those where the complaints are coming from if we can get a grip on it so that in the next couple months where we get the more snow it can be handled in a better fashion and we you know obviously will fix the problems that we had during the storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2286.638s">So,</a>  obviously, Winthrop Street, if we can check out who the driver is there, just give them some feedback, as well as any other complaints that have come in from either us or the mayor's office, if we can kind of, obviously, before the next storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2301.844s">Get</a>  a handle on it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2303.186s">On</a>  the motion, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2305.589s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2307.851s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2309.053s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2309.373s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2311.035s">On</a>  the motion, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2313.078s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2314.399s">One</a>  of the issues that I'm seeing in the community relative to snow removal, Mr. President, is the fact that there's a lack of <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2320.346s">Equipment</a>  standards for the plows that we contract with. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2323.928s">So</a>  we could have a, you know, three quarter ton F250 out there with a plow on it that's getting paid the same rate as somebody that has a Jeep Wrangler with a plow on it pushing snow around. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2332.432s">And</a>  I think we're getting more bang for our buck out of somebody that has a three quarter ton truck than somebody that's driving around in a quarter ton truck pushing snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2339.515s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd also like to ask that the DPW Director report back to the City Council what equipment standards are in place for those that are being allowed to contract plow with the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2352.567s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2361.841s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2364.183s">One</a>  of the major complaints that I've received over the last few days is the fact that our corners are not being shoveled out or plowed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2375.174s">Most</a>  of the plows are bringing the snow up to the corner, and you'll see snow banks five, six feet tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2383.338s">It</a>  makes it very difficult for residents who want to get out there and do the right thing to shovel these giant mounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2390.982s">I</a>  think the city has to do a better job in connecting our streets and our walking paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2397.385s">I,</a>  as one person that commutes on the MBTA every morning, can tell you that <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2402.407s">You</a>  can't make it down many roads now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2405.09s">Riverside</a>  Ave, there are literally some paths down Riverside Ave that seem to be, and I don't know how you shovel like a six inch path, but the path is literally, it's six inches wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2418.385s">I</a>  don't know how it gets like that, but some of the frustration that I hear from residents on main roads is the fact that they'll go out there and shovel, and then within an hour, a truck comes by and throws three times as much as they've already shoveled back on their sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2435.834s">They</a>  have to constantly be out there, and I don't know, maybe with this new piece of equipment, we can try to address some of the major roads, High Street, Winthrop Street, Salem Street, Main Street, you know, Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2449.802s">We</a>  need, and it's great to have one piece of equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2453.044s">But</a>  in a city this size, really, you know, I know they made a big hill of blue about this one piece of equipment they just bought, but you need probably five or six of those in a city this size to do the job in our business districts and around our schools and on our major thoroughfares. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2472.727s">So</a>  those are the complaints I received, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2475.488s">Temple</a>  Street was a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2477.728s">There</a>  were a number of streets out there that seemed to be forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2481.849s">And</a>  I'm not sure what happens when plows don't go down a street at all, if it's just an oversight or if it's something larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2492.196s">The</a>  second point is that there was a number to call regarding if you had a complaint that was sent out on reverse 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2501.742s">And</a>  I can tell you that that number wasn't minned around the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2507.485s">At</a>  least from the calls that I received, it wasn't manned around the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2511.366s">And</a>  when you have a snow emergency, you really have to have a 24-hour hotline, you really do, that residents can call and feel that they have someone to speak to, and at least the person on the other end is listening and letting them know, you know, ma'am, we're in a major snowstorm and, you know, we're gonna get to it, it's on our list. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2531.43s">And</a>  I think that's extremely important that we have that set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2536.252s">And</a>  I would ask that we recommend to the city administration that a 24-hour hotline during snow emergencies, so if the emergency is in effect for three days, it's three days of a 24-hour hotline that residents can call and get a response on the other end and at least know that this situation will eventually be addressed, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2696.803s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2698.585s">I</a>  think it's important also if we find out how many tickets were issued during this previous snowstorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2706.575s">for</a>  residents not shoveling, and I had a brief conversation because he was so busy with the foreman for Highway Steve Tanaglia, and I asked him why the state highways seemed to be down to the pavement after it snowed, and why some of our streets were not. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2728.095s">And</a>  I asked whether we were using the same mixture that they put down prior to the snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2734.8s">And</a>  he said that we don't use the same mixture. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2738.343s">And</a>  it's something that him and the DPW commissioner are going to review and see whether or not they should go closer to the formula that the state uses that they put down. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2751.793s">In</a>  my opinion, just from living near the Felsway, whatever they put down works miracles. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2758.518s">It</a>  does a tremendous job keeping the snow from building up, the ice, and I think whatever they're using, we should follow suit, Mr. President, on many of our side streets and roads and main roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=2773.618s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3209.435s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3210.876s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn that the DPW review complaints, direct the plows to operate at a slower speed, and that they review the list of snow removal areas to include Tainter Street and the obstructing snow pile at the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3232.403s">that</a>  amended by Councilor Knight, that the DPW Director report back to us to explain the standard of snowplows that are engaged by the city for subcontractors, amended by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3254.313s">that</a>  the corners and sidewalks in the major districts and neighborhoods of the city have the snow reduced for visibility, that the DPW director or the code enforcement officer report to the city council with the number of tickets issued for not shoveling sidewalks and that the DPW follow up on <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3284.501s">and</a>  follow through on the safe paths that students follow on to school as far as snow removal of those avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3295.711s">And</a>  that the hotline that is established for complaints and concerns regarding snow be manned 24 hours during the duration of the snow emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3309.903s">It</a>  was amended by Council President Caraviello that the DPW Commissioner contact the state regarding the quality of snow plowing and the disbursement of snow done by state contractors on the state roads that's now impeding sidewalks and businesses on the state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3337.698s">It</a>  meant by council Falco to that the DPW director report to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3344.203s">How</a>  many subcontractors are engaged by the city during the storm and the degree to which that they receive training and that the standards that they achieve in the discharge of their duties end. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3363.859s">that</a>  the DPW Director request and require the removal of snow at the corner of Fern and Fulton Spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3373.442s">Finally</a>  amended by Councilor Scarpelli that the DPW Director <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3381.945s">City</a>  Council, whether or not there is a list, an operating list within the city that the snow removal foreman engages to make sure that those who are ailing at home receive direct attention as to the quality of the snow plowing at their houses so that they may, in the interest of their safety and security. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3413.702s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3414.563s">And</a>  if I may, I haven't lost it, have I? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3418.545s">But</a>  I am worn out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3420.126s">I</a>  would like to point out, if I could, through the chair, if you would indulge me, that I am delighted with the hard work of the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3428.832s">I'm</a>  very grateful to Commissioner Kearns, Foreman Tanaglia, and the various members and division heads within the Department of Public Works for their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3442.54s">Being</a>  jarred and banged about in those pieces of equipment is difficult, especially if you're doing it for 30 some odd hours without sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3450.904s">So</a>  thank you to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3452.345s">On</a>  the motion of approval by Councilor Lango-Curran, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3457.308s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3458.989s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3459.889s">The</a>  motion is passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3461.85s">And</a>  so ordered. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3462.931s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight that we return to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3468.836s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3469.977s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3471.098s">The</a>  motion granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3471.999s">18-021</a>  offered by President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3475.442s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council request the Mayor keep the lights on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3480.286s">Thank</a>  you Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3481.087s">Mr.</a>  Vice President, with the opening of Shibuya on New Year's Eve,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3505.923s">And</a>  the poor lighting that we have in the square, because I know we're investigating some new lights there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3512.566s">It'll</a>  be my recommendation that the city keep the lights on the trees for the remainder of the time, because... <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3521.23s">You</a>  have all these people walking from the parking lots over here, over to Chevalier, and the lighting on that part of the square is a little questionable and dim at the moment, plus the lights also look nice at Century Bank and at the other end. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3537.36s">In</a>  the interim, until we replace the lighting on the pole lamps to brighter lights, it'd be my request that the mayor keep the lights on both on the trees of City Hall, Salem Street, and High Street, and also request that Century Bank maybe keep their lights on for the remainder of the season until we get some better lights on the square.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3560.376s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3560.736s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor, President Caraviello, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3565.199s">Councilor</a>  Marx?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3567.323s">Mr.</a>  President, also maybe if we can make part of this report if the President doesn't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3572.873s">We've</a>  been waiting for an investigation on the lights in the square for over two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3581.84s">Two</a>  years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3582.761s">They</a>  did a section of Salem Street across from Alamo Roast Beef in that area, and they were reviewing the illumination to see if that's what the city wanted to go with, and then the issue fell off the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3599.94s">I'm</a>  not sure what happened, but it really needs, we need an update from the Office of Energy and Environment to find out where we are in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3608.008s">There's</a>  no reason why it should take two years to figure out what we're going to do with the lighting in the square, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3616.997s">I</a>  think this resolution speaks volumes for the fact that we've been waiting to get increased lighting in the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3624.906s">And</a>  I might add, not just Medford Square, in all our business districts, they all have the same low shabby lights that really illuminate nothing, not even the road, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3637.339s">Mr.</a>  Vice President, I was able to speak with the superintendent of Randazzo on the light situation, and he told me that they did have two sample heads that they were going to put up on a couple of lights to see how they work, but he also explained that part of the problem is those poles cannot accommodate <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3658.883s">Something</a>  with brighter lights because they would have to be fully replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3664.485s">But</a>  I don't know if he ever got a chance to put up the two that they had that were at the maximum brightness. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3672.009s">I</a>  think it was right after the storm that he got them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3675.17s">So</a>  if you want to ask Superintendent Wyeth Randazzo for his report on what happened to those heads.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3684.16s">Yes,</a>  so that, further amended by Councilor Caraviello, that Superintendent Rendazzo report back to us as well on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3694.944s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3698.185s">Move</a>  the question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3699.365s">Move</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3700.125s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Lungo-Koehn, finally.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3713.59s">I</a>  second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3713.971s">I</a>  second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3714.672s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3728.612s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3729.433s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3730.734s">Maybe</a>  we should go back to gas lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3732.976s">And,</a>  uh, Senate 18-022, offered by Vice President, uh, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be resolved that the administration provide Medford City Council with an update as it relates to the hiring of a traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3747.027s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3748.708s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3751.429s">This</a>  is something we've all been interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3754.451s">I</a>  put the request that we get an update for this on maybe three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3759.414s">At</a>  that time, I think a couple of my colleagues said yes, it was posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3763.716s">Now</a>  the residents are starting to ask, those that are concerned with the speed and the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3769.379s">Residents</a>  are starting to ask us and doing their own research, realizing that it's advertised, but not publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3776.182s">I</a>  don't know what sites they're looking on, <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3779.525s">It</a>  doesn't seem like we're making any progress, whether or not it's been posted on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3785.61s">I</a>  mean, we need to do more to try to get qualified people to apply for this job so we can make it a reality, bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3794.397s">I</a>  mean, it was four months ago I put this on last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3797.119s">Councilor</a>  Falco's been talking about this since he got elected the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3802.123s">This</a>  needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3803.084s">It</a>  was in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3804.845s">for</a>  fiscal year 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3805.865s">We</a>  are now six months out and we have nothing and it's just unfortunate.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3813.868s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3815.069s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3816.569s">I</a>  do agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3818.27s">I</a>  was hoping that this position would have been hired a while ago and I did actually call for an update just because I had been asked by a number of people as well with regard to this issue and what I was told is that it was posted <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3834.095s">A</a>  number of colleges and universities around here, the MMA as well, and they did interview a number of candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3842.464s">From</a>  what I was told, an offer was actually made, and last minute, the person actually rejected the offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3850.292s">They</a>  decided not to take it, and this is from what I was told. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3856.197s">So</a>  it's going to be reposted again by the end of January, the end of this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3862.4s">So</a>  that's where we stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3865.801s">From</a>  what I've been told is that basically it will be reposted and they're basically going to start the process again. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3873.324s">That's</a>  what I've been told. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3876.005s">I</a>  definitely feel your frustration because I'm just as frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3880.908s">I</a>  mean, this is something that I've been advocating for since I got on the council, and everyone here is supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3887.671s">It's</a>  something that's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3891.253s">It's</a>  something that our community needs, and it's something that we need to get today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3896.236s">So</a>  hopefully we get some good candidates in, and hopefully they hire to this position sooner than later.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3908.663s">I</a>  still would like just to get a update in writing and maybe amend this and ask for a listing of all places that it will be posted for the second time the end of this month just so we can better tell the people that yes it's getting posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3929.318s">It's</a>  getting posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=3930.879s">these</a>  ten places, and then we can maybe make recommendations, talk to people who are either in the field or who know where it should or shouldn't be posted, and give suggestions to the administration of, hey, why don't we also post it, you know, I mean, I'm not looking for a traffic engineer job, but people may know better places to post it or additional places to post it, because I think if we all work together, maybe we can make it happen.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4865.788s">The</a>  great president of Colleen, very active in the Chamber of Commerce and the community, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4871.491s">Joseph's</a>  Church, I mean, you know, anybody needed anything, Colleen was the first to step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4876.975s">Donations,</a>  the use of her restaurant, and again, certainly one of the longtime icons of Medford Square, and her presence will be missed in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4891.803s">Eighteen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4893.57s">uh...</a>  offered by president caribbean will be a result of the city council so this is also is the family of dr detector for the long-time volunteer uh... was of the communities that was very active in our community and her presence in the west of the community is going to be missed by many again uh... guardian another another icon of west medford uh... all the time and i'll spend the rest of the community center uh... people like that just uh... just don't get replaced so again uh... <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4924.422s">My</a>  condolences to her and her family. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4926.542s">And</a>  if we could all stand for a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4940.205s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4940.605s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4942.386s">Dr.</a>  Del Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4943.086s">Before</a>  we adjourn, if I could invite a citizen who wishes to speak and share a discourse on the recycling scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4954.395s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4956.676s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4957.176s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4958.597s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Eastford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4964.879s">First</a>  of all, I wish you all a very good, healthy New Year to everyone, sincerely. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4971.857s">I</a>  came in this evening earlier, and downstairs I noticed this one-page flyer at the information booth table, and it jarred my memory, because I don't recollect <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4987.047s">If</a>  I ever receive this year's recycling brochure schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4993.273s">So</a>  if any of the Councilors know the answer, I'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=4996.096s">Or</a>  else I'll have to go through some old mail and see if I misfiled it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5000.68s">I</a>  would like to know that for the sake of better disposal for, especially for the absentee owners that live on my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5007.826s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5009.145s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Casagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5010.668s">Does</a>  anyone know the answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5012.913s">We</a>  do not know the answer, but we'll do our best to find it out for you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5021.938s">I'm</a>  sorry it's not in form and I'd be happy to write a resolution, but I'd like to also request that the administration investigate extending Christmas tree pickup for another week or so based upon the inclement weather that's outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5033.95s">I</a>  think it might be a good gesture to allow some people some time to get their driveways and sidewalks cleared away before they get their trees out of the house.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5043.21s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, that the administration investigate more time for the Christmas trees to be picked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5054.614s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5056.035s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5058.665s">Ricketts.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5059.666s">Ricketts.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5062.327s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5063.788s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5064.468s">Just</a>  briefly, we all received an email today regarding the broadcast equipment that's located here at City Hall and how outdated the equipment is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5074.734s">And</a>  the new gentleman, his name escapes me, that's operating, Ben, <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5081.998s">The</a>  community access station put together some figures and facts on what equipment we need and the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5090.923s">This</a>  would also include the equipment that this council supported regarding having cameras televise our hearing rooms and be part of that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5103.149s">And</a>  I would ask that we as a council request the city administration submit to us a funding paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5110.052s">So</a>  we can move forward on these two very important issues, changing the outdated equipment here at City Hall, so people viewing this can actually make heads and tails of what's going on at this meeting, and also the meetings that are taking place in other rooms that are currently on televised, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5128.319s">So</a>  I would ask that we send a correspondence to the Mayor for a funding paper.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5134.895s">I</a>  just want to second this resolve the email we received I think was forwarded to us by the city clerk from Ben Brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5144.039s">It</a>  broke down all the information that we need with regards to cost for new equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5149.042s">It's</a>  one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5151.203s">Complaints</a>  we get of how this meeting is airing, school committee, as well as the fact that we would like more boards and commissions and more of our meetings televised for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5162.152s">We</a>  need a new system. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5163.653s">We</a>  need cameras in the <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5166.676s">different</a>  rooms in City Hall, one or two additional rooms, and I think it coincides with the funding we appropriated in the last budget with regards to videotaping and online, whether that was online streaming, I don't know exactly, but more transparency, the public's ability to watch and review documents and watch the meetings, it's extremely important, and I think it's something that is <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5192.435s">It's</a>  long overdue, so I second the resolve and hopefully we can move forward on that quickly along with the traffic engineer.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5201.728s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5202.608s">I</a>  also support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5204.029s">I</a>  think this is one of the key points in making the legislative software program successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5211.155s">We</a>  need to make sure that we have funding to buy the latest equipment to have in the meeting rooms and here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5218.761s">I</a>  think it promotes engagement with the citizens and making sure that they can see what happens here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5225.768s">Not</a>  only in this meeting, but with the boards and commissions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5229.415s">So</a>  I just want to go on record of supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5231.901s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5237.031s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5237.972s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5238.512s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5240.494s">Records.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5242.056s">Pass</a>  the councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5249.262s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to accept the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5251.764s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5253.546s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5255.087s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5255.167s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5257.449s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5259.511s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5260.812s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5260.932s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5261.793s">Meeting</a>  adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/0quSCPHBdB8&t=5267.89s">Representative</a>  Donato, call me.</p>
