    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=0.706s">Hey</a>  Medford, my name is Aaron Olapade and I'm running for Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=4.888s">My</a>  story is a testament to the transformative power of public education and community connections. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=9.891s">After</a>  arriving in Medford in 2013, I found direction, support, and purpose in the classroom, on the river as a member of the rowing team, and through community service. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=18.936s">I</a>  was, believe it or not, able to amass over 500 hours worth of time spent in the community before graduating from the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=25.419s">I</a>  became driven to lead by example and to work for equity, unity, and progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=31.287s">Whether</a>  it was as a community liaison for the city of Medford, a team captain at Boston College, a legislative aide in the Massachusetts State House, or serving underrepresented youth with City of Boston, I've been dedicated to these values. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=44.397s">My</a>  studies in political science and social justice at BC and my work with the NAACP just intensified my determination to represent the underrepresented and to make a difference through service. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=56.066s">As</a>  we stand at the crossroads of tradition and progress, <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=58.715s">Mine</a>  as a voice understands our past and fearlessly envisions our future. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=62.637s">I'm</a>  a product of the Medford schools, an advocate for youth, and a representative who has walked the hallways and felt the community's struggles. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=70.24s">My</a>  experience leads me to a platform with these three priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=73.942s">One,</a>  a safe and supportive learning environment that produces a quality education. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=78.304s">I</a>  envision Medford where students are equipped to handle life's challenges both inside and outside the classroom and can thrive as whole humans. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=85.747s">What</a>  will I do to address this? <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=87.973s">I</a>  will advocate for budgets, buildings, books, and all the tools necessary for students and educators to excel in an environment that promotes safety, security, and sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=97.838s">Students</a>  will be paramount. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=99.7s">I</a>  will emphasize the importance of mental health resources, tools for social-emotional growth, and programs that are focused on conflict resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=107.124s">Two,</a>  equity inclusion, access, and opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=110.806s">I</a>  see the unequal footing that many students stand on and understand how racism and bigotry hinder young Medford minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=117.406s">I'm</a>  committed to fostering a learning environment where students feel valued, understood, and free from discrimination. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=124.27s">And</a>  I am devoted to ensuring that every student, regardless of their socioeconomic background, has the same opportunities in education. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=131.094s">What</a>  will I do to address this? <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=133.315s">This</a>  means making extracurriculars accessible, paying special attention to the needs of students with disabilities, those from lower income families, and English learners, and advocating for a more diverse teaching staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=144.248s">I'll</a>  advocate for educational initiatives that create an equitable and inclusive learning environment, such as integrating curriculum that includes contributions from different backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=154.912s">And</a>  I will champion an anti-racist, anti-ableist, and inclusive Medford Public Schools ethos. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=160.674s">And</a>  three, support of teachers, educators, and families through community collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=166.076s">Recognizing</a>  the backbone of our education system, I will use community collaboration to uplift and empower the educators and staff of Medford schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=173.617s">I</a>  know from personal experience the power of community, fostering collaboration between our schools, local organizations, and the broader Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=181.498s">We</a>  can tackle broader challenges and impact our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=184.419s">A</a>  holistic approach to education means ensuring students are nurtured at school, at home, and throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=190.56s">What</a>  am I going to do to address this? <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=193.12s">To</a>  solidify a passionate and motivated educational workforce, I'll work to ensure our staff and educators are fairly compensated, have a healthy work environment and the tools that they need <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=202.462s">and</a>  their voices are central in decision-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=205.583s">I</a>  will develop a community-wide commitment to achieve these priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=208.543s">I</a>  will seek ways to work in our community with parents, students, and local organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=214.165s">I</a>  will help to create tools for strengthening these partnerships, such as directories, committees, and an open and safe forum for feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=221.847s">I'm</a>  asking for your vote for Medford School Committee to embrace the idea that every student, teacher, and resident of Medford is heard and valued, that dreams and aspirations are elevated <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=232.76s">and</a>  the vibrant diversity that makes Medford unique is celebrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=237.384s">I'm</a>  also asking for your financial support because dog running for public office is really, really expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=244.13s">If</a>  you are able, please go to my website at electaaronlapate.com and help us with a donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=249.914s">Every</a>  amount makes a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=251.336s">Help</a>  us make sure that everyone is represented and together we create the school system that Medford deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/WcY6AFHwKGc&t=255.839s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>
