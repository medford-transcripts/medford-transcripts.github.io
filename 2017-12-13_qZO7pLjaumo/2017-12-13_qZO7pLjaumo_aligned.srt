19
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:39,508
All right.

20
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,932
Motion by Councilor Lococo for the suspension of the rules to take paper 17-795.

21
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,373
All those in favor?

22
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:47,693
Motion passes.

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,021
17795, offered by Councilor Lengelkern.

24
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:05,244
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council take a first reading on the ordinance change to read as follows.

25
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:12,167
In ordinance amending chapter 94 of the ordinance of the city of Medford, be it ordained that

26
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:41,490
by the City Council of the City of Medford that Chapter 94 of the Ordinance of the City of Medford entitled Zoning, Article 2, Division 1, Section 94-35, Paragraph E, that presently states, E, appeals from administrative decisions, petitions for variances, and applications for special permits shall be filed together with other supporting materials as required by applicable rules.

27
00:01:43,107 --> 00:02:02,892
The City Council or Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing and shall cause notice of such a hearing to be published in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40A, Section 11, as further amended and shall now state as follows.

28
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:03,552
A.

29
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:15,415
Appeals from administrative decisions, petitions for variances, and applications for special permits shall be filed together with other supporting materials as required by applicable rules.

30
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:29,480
The City Council or Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for hearing and shall cause notice of such hearing to be published in accordance with Massachusetts General Law's

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:46,692
Chapter 40A, section 11, and such notice shall also be given to all owners within 400 feet of the property line of the petitioner as the same are listed in the most recent tax list as kept by the chief assessor of the city.

32
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:54,517
And such notice shall also be given to the owners within 400 feet of the property line of the petitioner as the same area listed in the most

33
00:02:55,418 --> 00:03:08,931
recent text that's kept by the chief assessor of the city by way of telephone call, text message that uses computerized auto data to deliver a pre-recorded message or its equivalent.

34
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:10,753
Councilor Longo Kern.

35
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:17,379
Thank you, President Carviello, and thank you for reading it.

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,241
It's lengthy.

37
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:27,767
This was something that the council was interested in doing back in August of 2016.

38
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:32,408
It went to committee, and I believe there's some questions whether they were answered or not.

39
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:33,608
It just stayed in committee.

40
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:36,389
I brought it up again probably two months ago.

41
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:47,711
At that time, the council voted seven to nothing with regards to being interested in this and just needing legal language drafted by our city solicitor.

42
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:49,612
I followed up with the solicitor.

43
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:54,135
Thankfully, in November, a decision was rendered.

44
00:03:54,155 --> 00:04:00,041
I believe, I'm not sure if you received it before that, but I did forward it to everybody this morning, just in case.

45
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:04,004
It tells you what the prior requirements were under Mass General Law 48.

46
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:04,845
Yes, thank you.

47
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:12,584
Well, yeah, I know he's here.

48
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:14,426
I was just going to finish.

49
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:14,666
Yep.

50
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:20,670
Mass General Laws, Section 40, Chapter 40A, Section 11.

51
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:31,278
And the fact of the matter with regards to just notifying abutters and abutters to abutters is something that has caused a great deal of

52
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:50,955
put it plainly, heartache to those who live either across the street or very close to a potential, in this case, obviously we're doing it for mainly the developments that have been proposed and people finding out after the fact and being really upset

53
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:56,316
The council gets frantic emails and phone calls, and we're left having to step in.

54
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,216
Obviously, the mayor's office probably gets the same.

55
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:20,900
We're going to and from, myself and a number of counselors, going to and from OCD meetings and zoning meetings and conservation commission meetings to try to find out what's going on and how to give the residents the ability to be heard and to voice their concerns, questions, and get answers to specific questions that they do have.

56
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,205
So I think it's important, and I know it's important to this whole council, that we give more notice and that be done in multiple ways.

57
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:48,299
And what this proposed ordinance change does, that I'm thankful the solicitor drafted, is it provides notice to everybody, every owner within 400 feet, and it provides notice through mail and through our reverse 911 system, which is something that was well deserving of the reverse 911.

58
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,001
I think it's a win-win.

59
00:05:51,021 --> 00:06:05,165
I know there are some questions that the counselors may have, one being how enforceable this is, which our solicitor is here to discuss, and also if there is a minor permit or a minor variance that needs to be had, is this necessary?

60
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:09,647
And I think the answer is it's just necessary because

61
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:17,179
We have had such a problem over the last couple years, and we need to change that.

62
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,600
We need to change it for the people and the neighbors.

63
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:31,248
This is one step of many that has to be taken, and I ask my colleagues to obviously get your questions answered, but to move forward and vote for approval for the first reading of this ordinance change.

64
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:32,168
Thank you.

65
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:37,212
Mr. Solicitor, would you take any questions or any opinion?

66
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:44,518
I can give a supplement to what Councilor Lungo-Kern just said.

67
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:51,124
I can give a brief supplement which might go to the core of some concerns or some questions about the language.

68
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:55,608
First, my name.

69
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,629
My name is Mark Rumley.

70
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:57,610
I'm the city solicitor.

71
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,693
I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

72
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:10,805
right now, the way the state statute is, and you have to understand this in terms of state statute and local ordinance.

73
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:15,972
The state statute says, in terms of notice, that it should be given to

74
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:26,549
abutters to a petitioner property or abutters to abutters or those who are across the street within a 300-foot ambit.

75
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:33,036
Now that doesn't mean under the state statute that everybody within the 300-foot ambit would receive notice.

76
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:36,961
It just means abutters, abutters to abutters or those across the street.

77
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:53,658
The resolution which is before you tonight would make it a requirement that locally, that in the city of Medford, notice be given to all persons, all persons, within a 400-foot ambit.

78
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,645
Now, it's important to be cognizant of the fact that this is

79
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,286
in excess of what's required by the state statute.

80
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:10,590
Therefore, from a legal point of view, it would be considered directory only.

81
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,971
I want to give you an example.

82
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:13,673
The example would be this.

83
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:28,445
If you were somebody who was, say, 300 feet away, but you were not an abutter or an abutter to an abutter or across the street, and you disagreed with a decision made by the board,

84
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:39,929
If you appealed it, the land court would not recognize the fact that you didn't get notice because you were 300 feet away, because that's a local rule.

85
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:45,611
So the land court would not say that that would give you the status of a party in interest.

86
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,832
You would have to establish that another way.

87
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:56,536
So when I say that the extra notice would be directory only, it doesn't mean that it wouldn't be given, because if you pass it as an ordinance,

88
00:08:57,376 --> 00:09:00,939
then the board and commission would have to implement that.

89
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:21,132
However, what I'm saying is that if somebody appealed the decision to the courts, that would not give them an additional leg to stand on or some status that they didn't otherwise have because the state statute would control as being the only requirement that's compulsory.

90
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:27,276
So that's essentially what this ordinance would be.

91
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:40,623
And I have a little bit of data that I didn't have earlier this morning that I received from Mr. McDougal as to what this would mean from a substantive point of view by way of example, which I could give you if you like.

92
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:42,164
I'll just explain it.

93
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:50,710
Dennis McDougall is the clerk for the administrator for the ZBA.

94
00:09:51,210 --> 00:10:05,415
And just as an example of what this would mean, there's one project, I won't give the address, it's not that important, but it was the change of a property from a single family to a two family.

95
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:06,956
It was before the Board of Appeals.

96
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:16,248
Under the state statute, which means abutters, abutters to abutters, or those across the street, there were 10 notices that were given out.

97
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:28,463
If it were all owners within 300 feet, there were 234 people that would have to be notified because there was a condominium within that area.

98
00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:36,731
If it were 400 feet, there'd be 357 people that would have had to have been notified because of that condominium.

99
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:40,155
Now, that's a very steep example.

100
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:47,557
There's another one where, on a matter before the ZBA, under the law, 18 people were notified.

101
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:51,439
If the circle was drawn at 300 feet, 38 people would be notified.

102
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,760
And at 400 feet, 60 people would be notified.

103
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:05,828
So you can see how there's an additional notice requirement if you draw the circle further out and further out.

104
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:07,009
That's how this would work.

105
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:13,834
So I give that to you simply for your information, but that's how this would work.

106
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:18,257
And the condominium example is steep because obviously there are many units in a condominium.

107
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:20,519
Thank you.

108
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:24,002
Councilor Falco.

109
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:25,123
Thank you, Mr. President.

110
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:28,224
City Solicitor Rumley, if I may ask a few questions.

111
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:33,006
So is this enforceable as far as if we were to vote for this change?

112
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:41,630
I mean, is it enforceable as far as from, I mean, I guess you could always appeal it, but I mean, do we have any grounds to enforce this, I guess?

113
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,491
Yes, the enforceability would be this.

114
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:47,393
It would be a requirement of the local board and commission to give that notice.

115
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:52,814
Actually, it would be the petitioner who's going forth to make sure that that notice is given.

116
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:59,975
For example, Mr. McDougall does the notices for the Board of Appeals, but the costs of that are borne by the petitioner.

117
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:01,415
Is it enforceable?

118
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,836
So the answer to that question is split.

119
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:11,537
The first part of the answer is, if it's made an ordinance, then it is required that it be implemented by the local board or commission.

120
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:17,218
However, at the state level, if there was an appeal to the courts,

121
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:22,364
It would be informational, but not required.

122
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:26,952
So to the degree that you would think that the state would enforce it, it would not.

123
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:36,358
So I mean, I think it's interesting, and I think it's definitely, I definitely like notifying more people.

124
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:37,498
I think that's a good thing.

125
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,040
I just have, I guess, some concerns that there's like unintended consequences here.

126
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:49,383
So for like the local person that's trying to make a home improvement, put a deck on the back of their house, and they need a variance.

127
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:50,984
Maybe they're too close to the property line.

128
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:58,607
So if they have that type of a situation, that person is going to have to notify

129
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,071
everyone within that 400 foot?

130
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,892
Yes, if this ordinance were passed in its present form, yes.

131
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:09,453
And they would actually pay the cost of that as well?

132
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:12,174
Yeah, I don't know what the cost would be of something like that.

133
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:13,395
But they're responsible for that?

134
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:14,795
Ultimately, yes.

135
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:27,980
It's done by Mr. McDougal, but the notices, the labels, I think the postage, along with the petition fee, advertisement, that's borne by the petitioner.

136
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:34,223
That's my concern, because I definitely like the idea of making sure that we notify more people.

137
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:42,066
But I guess I'm worried about once you get into the neighborhoods, if you're doing something to increase the value of your property.

138
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:44,086
Maybe you're putting on a deck.

139
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:49,808
You're doing some sort of home improvement, and it's not that major.

140
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:56,603
You know, there's a concern, I think, that you're adding a cost to that.

141
00:13:57,183 --> 00:14:00,483
And there's just a little bit of a concern there.

142
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:08,225
So I think for big developments, this is something that's definitely needed and warranted.

143
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:12,525
I mean, I think it's definitely something that would benefit the whole neighborhood.

144
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:18,346
But for someone that's doing a small type of home improvement, I have some concerns there.

145
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:27,672
my colleague wouldn't mind if we could amend this maybe just to projects that have to go through site plan review.

146
00:14:27,852 --> 00:14:29,233
And I'm not sure if that makes sense.

147
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:30,314
Maybe you could weigh in on that.

148
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:43,145
But I'm just thinking that if we're going to have local, my concern is that if we're going to have local neighbors that want to make an improvement and add cost to that and add more red tape to that, I think that's a little bit of a concern.

149
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:47,148
So I'm just thinking if maybe we could have this apply to any type of

150
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:52,132
project that requires site plan review, maybe that's the direction we should head in.

151
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:57,375
And that's an amendment to the resolution that I would offer if my colleague is willing to accept that.

152
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:00,357
Well, I can answer you this way, Counselor.

153
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:05,300
First, a site plan review project is one which has a greater magnitude towards it.

154
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,362
I think it's six or more units for site plan review.

155
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:13,905
Of the list that I had for Mr. McDougall today, which again is just for my

156
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:15,987
information.

157
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:20,571
There were two projects that he has here that were subject to site plan review.

158
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:32,840
And the first one, under the present law, or under the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, under the first one, there were 20 abutters, or abutters to abutters, et cetera, who were notified.

159
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:36,804
If it went to 300 feet, there would have been 71.

160
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,306
If it went to 400 feet, there would have been 100.

161
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:52,286
In the next project that was subject to site plan review, under the law and the state statute in its present incarnation, the number of people notified was 15.

162
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:58,752
If that line were drawn out 300 feet, it would have been 58 people notified.

163
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:04,558
And if the line were drawn out to 400 feet, it would be 99 people who would have been notified.

164
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:13,326
So there you can see, and of course that all depends upon the location, because as I said earlier, if there's a condo next door, that number's gonna go up exponentially.

165
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:21,254
So site plan review is only applicable, my recollection is, to projects which call for six units or more.

166
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:26,930
I appreciate that.

167
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,351
Thank you.

168
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:29,392
That's just my concern.

169
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:31,614
I like the resolution.

170
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:42,023
I think we should be reaching out to actually communicate with more people in the neighborhood when there's a project or development that's going to impact them.

171
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,245
So more communication is definitely better.

172
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:57,332
if there's some unintended consequences to this where we're gonna impact them financially and make a simple home improvement into a larger type of project.

173
00:16:58,092 --> 00:17:05,575
So that's why I offer the resolution if you're willing that maybe we have this apply just to something that requires site plan review.

174
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:11,218
That's up to Council Member Kern.

175
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,499
Thank you.

176
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:14,039
Council Member Kern.

177
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:21,799
I definitely think that that is something I'd like to hear the rest of my colleagues discuss.

178
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:28,484
I don't see the harm in that, and I'm not putting this forward to hurt the individual homeowner.

179
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:33,549
I think you can look at it two ways, which is definitely, that is an option.

180
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:36,391
I don't think it's a huge financial burden.

181
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:39,713
100 people need to be notified.

182
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:42,454
It's going to be $49 in postage.

183
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:47,817
But six or more units is something that definitely can be talked about tonight and discussed.

184
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,132
Councilor Scott Pelley.

185
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:52,972
I'm done for now.

186
00:17:53,092 --> 00:17:53,232
Yes.

187
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:54,893
Councilor Scott Pelley.

188
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:56,635
Thank you, Mr. President.

189
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,877
Thank you for bringing this forward.

190
00:18:01,198 --> 00:18:12,345
And to this solicitor, I know John already brought this up and I don't want to be redundant, but I actually had two phone calls today that residents were running to the builder's office today to try to secure permits.

191
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,849
and possibly variances because they were looking at building up.

192
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:34,647
Because when they're nervous, the same questions you had, probably I've been getting, and I think that's my concern, is that the home improvement jobs, the home improvement variances that people will be looking for because, you know, facts are facts.

193
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:48,015
The costs of housing now have gone up, so people want to take advantage of that while they can and try to make their homes the best they can at this time.

194
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:59,162
So looking at the fear of someone questioning it down the line or that don't belong, that don't live in that radius.

195
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:11,968
and that these people that they've grown up and the neighbors that they know that they might have talked to and let them know that this is what's happening, that they'll be going to the, you know, the appeal board and they'll be looking for something like this.

196
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:25,074
They're just nervous that if it goes further out where people might not want a two family or a, you know, a second floor built or that they would question out of fear that they wouldn't get this.

197
00:19:25,254 --> 00:19:26,794
This is one of the biggest concerns.

198
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:43,558
So I like the idea that putting it for the six or more units, I think that that's probably our biggest fear that we've heard here, is that the fear that things are happening so fast, so quick, and notifying people.

199
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:54,441
But my question is, ultimately, it can't be, the ordinance can't be written, excuse me, I'm getting off track, but the question is that

200
00:19:56,217 --> 00:20:10,346
If this, what we have in line right now, if this is adopted, it still goes to the state level, and the state level, it's just something that can be heard, but can't be used as judgment.

201
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,508
All right.

202
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,129
It's a valid concern, and it gets a little bit confusing.

203
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,463
But it runs this way.

204
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:21,405
The state statute is the core.

205
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:23,085
It is required.

206
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:24,606
It is compulsory.

207
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:34,190
And the state statute says that notice must be given to abutters, or abutters to abutters, and those across the street, within 300 feet.

208
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,670
That's the core.

209
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:36,751
That doesn't change.

210
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:38,191
And that's required.

211
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:43,374
This would be additional requirement, a local option.

212
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:44,494
Not local option.

213
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:45,334
That's not the way to put it.

214
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:46,375
Local requirement.

215
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:55,210
And if it's passed by the council ultimately, then the Board of Appeals would have to implement that notice requirement.

216
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,913
Now as I said at the beginning, if Mr. Jones or Ms.

217
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:09,542
Smith is not happy with the approval of a variance or whatever it is, and then appeals to the court, if they're not in that core area,

218
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:14,688
They would not be considered to be a party in interest because of their location.

219
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,229
There may be some other reasons that they could have standing.

220
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:18,330
I'm not saying that they wouldn't.

221
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:24,915
But their location, if they're outside of that core area, would not give them proper standing.

222
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:32,079
What it would do is mean that from a local point of view, here in Medford, they would get some notification.

223
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:33,180
Now here's the thing.

224
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,222
There's nothing bad in anything that anybody just said.

225
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:43,583
I don't want to sound like Pollyanna, but I've been part of municipal government for 34 years.

226
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:49,548
And one of the common threads that goes through as a criticism is, I didn't know.

227
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:52,070
When did that happen?

228
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:54,992
Who did that?

229
00:21:55,973 --> 00:22:04,120
And when that occurs, what you have is a lessening of the quantum of trust that a resident has in the local government.

230
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:14,736
This measure will address that in a fashion by giving greater notice, even if it doesn't give legal teeth.

231
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:20,719
The benefit of fine-tuning it is that Ms.

232
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:34,388
Jones or Mr. Smith, who wants to extend a bedroom for maybe an elderly member of their family, won't have to go through hoops if this only applies to larger projects.

233
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:46,934
And generally speaking, I don't hear, in my 34 years, I don't hear, I didn't know about that when we're talking about a neighbor increasing the size of their house a little bit for a family reason.

234
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:51,036
When you hear it, you already know the projects that you hear it on.

235
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:52,576
They don't have to say what they are.

236
00:22:53,837 --> 00:23:04,440
But they're the larger projects, the ones that have multiple units, the ones that have traffic impact, which, by the way, is an element or an issue that has to be reviewed in site plan review.

237
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,161
Traffic.

238
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:09,222
And those are the ones where people say, I didn't know that.

239
00:23:10,215 --> 00:23:14,136
And so there's where, if there is any fine-tuning, that may be a benefit.

240
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:30,161
The other thing is, since this is an amendment to the zoning ordinance, then this would have to go, assuming that it left the launching pad here at the city council, it would have to go to the planning board for a public hearing.

241
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:36,582
So the input of others could be received, too, and then the planning board makes its recommendation back to the council.

242
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:38,703
Well, that's a pretty good thing to have.

243
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:43,907
public input on whether or not to extend public notification.

244
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:46,429
Seems to me that that fits together like Legos.

245
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:48,904
So that's what I'd say.

246
00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:52,745
Thank you very much for my trivial response.

247
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:58,906
But I think, again, I know that Mike, a council colleague, put together a very thoughtful ordinance.

248
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:16,270
I think that the concerns that Councilor Falco brought up with the site plan review, I would definitely support this if, because I think we all sit here and understand the phone calls we get with the bigger developments that come out that are affecting the zoning that's affecting our

249
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:25,202
our community so I will support this wholeheartedly if we can that I agree with what Councilor Falco stated.

250
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:34,679
site plan reviews, anything over six units, that this would be implemented.

251
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:50,422
So I think that wouldn't affect the phone calls I got that were questioning and nervousness and the fear of our neighbors that how this could affect a homeowner who is looking to improve their home and their future.

252
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:54,363
So I hope that helps with the other Brianna, but thank you.

253
00:24:55,583 --> 00:25:06,917
The clerk is informing me that the cost is approximately a dollar to send out a mailing to all the homes, and then it's another dollar because he has to also mail them the decision that is printed.

254
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:10,742
So it will be about $2 per household.

255
00:25:15,736 --> 00:25:30,547
City Solicitor Rumley has framed this in a pretty basic and outright fashion, that the steps that we need to go through, if we decide to adopt the zoning amendment this evening, that it goes to the Community Development Board for a public hearing.

256
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:36,631
So, in looking at the action that we're taking here as a body tonight, I think we're torn.

257
00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:38,473
I mean, we've all sat here and we've all talked about

258
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:40,214
requirements for notice.

259
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:44,556
We want more people to know what's going on in their neighborhood and we don't want to hurt people at the same time, Mr. President.

260
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:56,003
So here we have a proposal that would increase the notification ramifications by about 100 yards and then also add everybody that lives in that jurisdiction to the notification requirements.

261
00:25:56,524 --> 00:26:03,188
I think it might be in our best interest to send the paper as authored to the Community Development Board for their input at a public hearing.

262
00:26:03,588 --> 00:26:06,469
Get the information and the input that they can secure

263
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:13,154
And when they bring it back to us, then we'll be in a better position to make a determination as to what language changes we would like to see made.

264
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:28,164
I certainly would agree that I think projects requiring site plan review only would be something that I'd be very supportive of, Mr. President, but I don't think that that's going to be something that's going to be a hindrance for me this evening for supporting this measure and sending it to the Community Development Board for a public hearing and for their input.

265
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:29,445
Thank you.

266
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:31,266
Councillor DelaRusso.

267
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:34,769
Councillor DelaRusso.

268
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:36,350
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

269
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:52,236
I'm generally in favor of this expanded notification, but if I could, Mr. President, through the chair to the solicitor, ask a question regarding the amendment.

270
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:54,177
My question is this.

271
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:21,251
It was stated by Councilor Lungo Kern that, and I'm sure this is true without a doubt, that we're not seeking to harm the homeowner in this ordinance, but if we put a stipulation on the expansion of the notification to those

272
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:32,357
projects that require site plan review, i.e., a way of getting at the bigger projects, is that a signaling that we're aiming to harm someone?

273
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:34,057
Could it be read as that?

274
00:27:34,397 --> 00:27:35,858
So are we targeting someone?

275
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:37,718
Are we being prejudicial?

276
00:27:37,818 --> 00:27:41,599
So what applies to one thing, should it apply to all?

277
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,879
That's just my question.

278
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,320
I get the question, and I'd say this.

279
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:52,827
First of all, the legislative discretion of a body like the City Council is indeed that.

280
00:27:53,528 --> 00:28:02,595
If you exercise that discretion in a reasonable way, based upon considerations before you, it would not be arbitrary nor would it be discriminatory.

281
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:07,358
In addition, the greater concern of the public is always the larger projects.

282
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:11,420
It's not the smaller ones that have been alluded to here tonight.

283
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:19,845
So indeed, if a large developer said, I'm being prejudiced by having to notice this many people, I would say, so what?

284
00:28:21,886 --> 00:28:25,288
Take your shot, bring us to court, and let's see what happens.

285
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:27,549
Thank you.

286
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,270
You're welcome.

287
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,911
Thank you, Mr. President.

288
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:31,923
Council Member Kern.

289
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:33,745
Thank you, President Carviello.

290
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:37,147
I think we've heard from a number of councilors.

291
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:47,273
It looks like there potentially is a vote to pass the first reading tonight, but as long as there's limited to site plan review projects or greater, obviously.

292
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:51,236
Just plain devil's advocate, my question would be to the solicitor is

293
00:28:52,933 --> 00:29:00,721
I understand if it has to do with the deck or expanding a home so you can have a couple more feet in your bedroom or walk-in closet, whatever it might be.

294
00:29:01,221 --> 00:29:05,606
Those are the people that obviously we don't want to have to bear the burden of hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

295
00:29:06,186 --> 00:29:12,052
But what about a single family home that the owner wants to turn it into a three-family?

296
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:16,796
it's a two-family district or it's a single-family district.

297
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:27,205
Now, I'm playing devil's advocate because if that was in my neighborhood and it was down the street in a single-family district and a homeowner wanted to put up a three-family, I'd want to know.

298
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:27,826
Right.

299
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:30,588
And I don't think necessarily that you're playing devil's advocate.

300
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:33,491
What you're doing is drawing the line at a different place.

301
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:34,332
Right.

302
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:34,892
Right.

303
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:36,834
And how could we do that?

304
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:45,944
Well, I think that the best thing is to let the planning board have some people in to hear their opinions so they can make appropriate recommendations back to the council.

305
00:29:46,464 --> 00:30:02,837
So because while the line suggested tonight by a prospective amendment has been projects that would require site plan review, and you just pointed out a larger project than a small addition to a house that nonetheless may impact a particular neighborhood,

306
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:05,698
That is drawing the line at a different place.

307
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:16,023
And I think the best way to decide where to draw that line, and I don't say that either one of those ideas are wrong, even the initial idea is not wrong, it's a matter of judgment and choice.

308
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,525
So the question is where is that line drawn?

309
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:24,387
And that really is something that would be interesting to receive in the recommendation from the planning board.

310
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:27,109
So I understand your point, Counselor.

311
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:30,210
I think you're drawing the boundary line at a little different place.

312
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,391
There's nothing wrong with that.

313
00:30:34,772 --> 00:30:35,072
Thank you.

314
00:30:36,693 --> 00:30:37,373
Vice President Mox.

315
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:38,854
Thank you, Mr. President.

316
00:30:40,795 --> 00:31:00,104
Mr. Solicitor, in the letter dated November 8th regarding this paper 17-731, your response to the mayor on page 2, the last paragraph, it states that failure to comply with the ordinance requirements would not invalidate the approval of a variance.

317
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:00,765
That's correct.

318
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:19,884
And my question to you would be, if this was not implemented and the Zoning Board of Appeals did not comply with the state statute, would that be, in and of itself, a reason to invalidate approval of a variance?

319
00:31:20,204 --> 00:31:25,109
Not complying with the state statute would absolutely be a reason to invalidate something.

320
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:26,310
That's happened before.

321
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:35,378
Years ago, there was a clerk of the ZBA who was ill with cancer and certain notices didn't go out.

322
00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:40,522
That case was in the land court for one day and came back for re-notification.

323
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:59,303
So based on that, I guess my question is that other than the fact that we're going to create a city ordinance, what would bound the Zoning Board of Appeals to follow it?

324
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:07,683
If there's no ramification on whether or not they follow it, it doesn't impact an appeal.

325
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:16,028
As you mentioned, it's governed by state statutory requirements or regulations.

326
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:22,502
So what would bound them to follow this new notification of 400 feet?

327
00:32:23,062 --> 00:32:35,115
All municipal employees, and that includes board and commission members, are required to comply with the requirements set forth in the revised ordinances of the City of Medford.

328
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,356
If they do not,

329
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:39,379
what could happen to them.

330
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,704
I really don't know, not being the person that appoints them, what could happen.

331
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:54,234
But I'll tell you this, if a board or commission member just summarily said, well, we're not doing that, we don't really care what the ordinance says, we have a fundamental problem that would have to be addressed.

332
00:32:54,635 --> 00:32:57,378
And it wouldn't be addressed by way of another ordinance.

333
00:32:57,698 --> 00:32:59,600
I think it would be addressed by way of removal.

334
00:33:01,706 --> 00:33:08,931
So you're saying once this is implemented, then we can rest assured that notification will take place based on whatever the ordinance reads?

335
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:17,016
Yes, the words that you used, rest assured, sounds like, could I say that once the ordinance is in place, that it will always be complied with?

336
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:23,921
There's always room for the frailty of human nature and error.

337
00:33:24,221 --> 00:33:28,644
I'm not saying that it's a foolproof system, but it certainly is greater than what exists right now.

338
00:33:29,364 --> 00:33:31,205
And it may or may not be implemented.

339
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:46,393
The reason why I bring it up, Mr. Solicitor, is that one of the ZBA meetings, it was brought up by a member of this council during public participation, that we may be interested in expanding their notification by changing city ordinance.

340
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:50,635
And one of the board members more or less said, do whatever you have to do.

341
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:51,836
We're not going to follow it anyways.

342
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:56,417
And that was my concern, Mr. Solicitor.

343
00:33:56,997 --> 00:34:15,983
And if it doesn't invalidate, to me, if it's a city ordinance, and I realize what you're saying about appeals and so forth, but if it's a city ordinance and our own Zoning Board of Appeals does not adhere to the notification process that's laid out, that should be enough to invalidate whatever variance they gave out.

344
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:20,543
So to me, that should be enough.

345
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:22,825
I get what you're saying.

346
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:26,268
What you're saying is that the remedy should be invalidation of the variance.

347
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:38,159
However, if the variance is given in compliance with the state law, the fact that the municipal law wasn't followed or the municipal ordinance wasn't followed would not, in and of itself, invalidate the approval.

348
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:40,020
That's clear in what my opinion is.

349
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:41,562
I will agree with you.

350
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:46,848
that if a board or commission member just summarily says, I don't care what you say, we're not doing it.

351
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:57,401
That raises another issue which I think has to be remedied in a different way than invalidating an approval that's consistent with state law.

352
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:08,979
If it's consistent with state law and somebody thumbed their nose at you, but it's consistent with state law, I think the remedy is not to invalidate the approval.

353
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:11,960
The remedy is something else, which I think is removal.

354
00:35:12,701 --> 00:35:16,143
Of course, that's just my opinion.

355
00:35:16,943 --> 00:35:17,984
We appreciate your opinion.

356
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:27,987
like what Councilor Falco threw out there by trying to target site plan review for units over six.

357
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:43,140
On the other side, I can see, as Councilor Longo-Kirk mentioned, that a lot of the projects we're going through now are in commercial zoned areas and so forth, but as we're seeing development, we're seeing it in neighborhoods.

358
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,686
And the complaints that I'm also receiving aren't just on main roads or in commercial industrial areas, they're in neighborhoods.

359
00:35:52,366 --> 00:36:00,091
And I, too, would like to see maybe some discussion, and that may be for a future or the

360
00:36:01,812 --> 00:36:23,141
the zoning board itself, when they have their public hearing, to look at how do we rest assure that we don't target, naturally, someone that wants to put another foot onto their porch, in their backyard, but target units that will have an impact, as the city solicitor mentioned, regarding traffic, regarding quality of life, regarding

361
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:34,811
A lot of other issues, infrastructure, water pressure, and a host of other issues that usually come when you develop large projects.

362
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:43,779
So I too would like to see a compromise on that and possibly lower the number of units and not just site plan review.

363
00:36:46,242 --> 00:36:47,162
Councilor Knight.

364
00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:48,023
Thank you, Mr. President.

365
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:49,865
Councilor Rumley, this question is also for you.

366
00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:14,778
If an applicant is in substantial compliance with the state law but fails to comply with the local expanded ordinance and submits their application in compliance with one but not the other, does the clock start ticking on the Zoning Board of Appeals timelines relative to when they have to take the application up for hearing?

367
00:37:15,478 --> 00:37:20,740
The statutory time frames are not waivable or changeable locally.

368
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:24,802
There are time frames during which times the Board of Appeals must act.

369
00:37:24,862 --> 00:37:27,483
If they do not, then there is constructive approval.

370
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:32,526
I can tell you, having been down the road on a couple of constructive approval cases over the years,

371
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:37,028
It's a very steep way to try to get an approval.

372
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:45,911
Because what happens is, if somebody says the Board of Appeals didn't act within a certain time frame, and then they go for their building permit, you might say, well, everything's OK, right?

373
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:49,573
Well, the building department is going to say, is this OK?

374
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:50,533
So then they come to me.

375
00:37:50,593 --> 00:37:53,834
We look at the time frames, whether or not everything is the way it's supposed to be.

376
00:37:54,314 --> 00:38:00,657
But the litmus test on something like that is the lender who's lending to the person that's developing, in this case.

377
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:07,062
The lender might say, I don't know if I want a loan on this project because you got a constructive approval from the ZBA.

378
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:10,805
There are all kinds of variables when that stuff happens, all kinds.

379
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:21,981
So if they put the application in and only just notify abutters of abutters within 300 feet, the time frame starts ticking right away.

380
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:27,727
And the zoning board has no recourse to require them to expand the notification to the city ordinance.

381
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:32,592
Well, we're hoping that the board is going to request their clerk to make sure that that's implied with, yes.

382
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:45,306
So through the clerk, what does our next step have to be?

383
00:38:45,346 --> 00:38:47,726
Can we take a first reading or if we even got there?

384
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:53,308
This is a zoning matter.

385
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:59,009
So it has to be referred to the Community Development Board for their recommendation of public hearing.

386
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:01,790
Then it comes back if you accept

387
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:09,753
the recommendations, then you would vote to go out to public hearing.

388
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:12,055
Which is a two week process, two or three week process.

389
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:16,997
So we have to move and get a vote on moving this to?

390
00:39:17,017 --> 00:39:18,217
You have to send it up.

391
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:19,278
Send it up to?

392
00:39:19,298 --> 00:39:20,559
Send it up to the Community Development Board.

393
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:24,080
So I make a motion that we send this up to the Community Development Board.

394
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,181
Second.

395
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,022
If I can, point of information.

396
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:29,803
Councilor Scott, point of information.

397
00:39:31,055 --> 00:39:42,041
Is this as amended with what we talked about with the three, you know, with looking into, you know, the site review and the three family?

398
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:44,022
That would be, we send the whole paper.

399
00:39:44,102 --> 00:39:50,205
We send the whole thing, okay, all right, thank you.

400
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:51,846
Councilor Falco, I mean Councilor Knight.

401
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:55,108
Is this the amendment?

402
00:39:55,188 --> 00:39:55,788
What do we got?

403
00:39:56,108 --> 00:39:58,310
Is this the motion with ritual methods?

404
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:08,104
The paper is as it is until we make an amendment to it.

405
00:40:08,124 --> 00:40:16,934
Can we ask for them to review it with all our discussions and I'm sure they're going to have a public hearing and then give us their opinions.

406
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:26,781
This paper, as is written, will go to the Community Development Board for their public hearing.

407
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:30,423
If you want to add that amendment, they'll look at that amendment also.

408
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:31,604
Maybe an amendment would be?

409
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:39,368
If they want to incorporate it, they'll come back, but with their language and their recommendations.

410
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:43,591
So why don't we amend this through the chair to read

411
00:40:46,293 --> 00:41:07,294
To exclude it, but we could get it probably perfectly but amendment amended to exclude property owners who all only want to make a small change like a Deck or an extension of a bedroom on their property Mr. President if I may go tonight

412
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:12,791
Ultimately it's going to go to the community development board for a public hearing, right?

413
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:17,992
They're going to have a public hearing and they're going to get input from the public and they're going to come back to us and make a recommendation to us.

414
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:27,053
If we're going to be sending them a document and we're going to say we want this amendment and that amendment, I think that it's incumbent upon us to get language together and send them that language, Mr. President.

415
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:35,255
So if we were going to take a vote on this matter this evening and we sent them the proposal as written, that's the language, we send it up to them, it's going to come back to us anyway.

416
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:40,307
In the interim, if we want to put together a site, print and review language, or anything else, we can do that.

417
00:41:41,675 --> 00:41:45,016
We can do that because the bill is still going to have to go through its three readings here at this level.

418
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:50,597
But ultimately, what we want to do is get input from the general public as to what they think is going to be good for them.

419
00:41:51,157 --> 00:41:54,398
So we're already starting to amend a paper that's an idea.

420
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:57,719
And I think this idea is going to be shaped by the input that happens at the public hearing.

421
00:41:57,739 --> 00:42:00,640
So I think it might be a good idea for us, Mr. President, to send this paper forward now.

422
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:09,442
Now, I'm wholeheartedly in support of limiting the scope to site plan review or to something a little bit smaller than Mrs. Jones getting her porch done or Mrs. O'Malley trying to expand her driveway.

423
00:42:09,482 --> 00:42:10,222
I don't think that that's...

424
00:42:11,222 --> 00:42:13,123
the legislative intent of this proposal.

425
00:42:13,203 --> 00:42:15,725
I don't think that that's what Councilor Lungo is trying to accomplish.

426
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:23,910
I think what she's trying to accomplish is expanding notifications in neighborhoods so people feel as though they have a voice, a voice in their neighborhood as to what's going on and what direction things are going in.

427
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:34,897
So why don't we let that process happen, and then when it comes back to us, we'll have the ability and the opportunity to make all the changes to it in the world we need, but we'll have more information and more data to make an informed decision.

428
00:42:35,497 --> 00:42:35,938
I second that.

429
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:36,178
Thank you.

430
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:37,479
Councilor Falco.

431
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:38,700
Thank you.

432
00:42:39,361 --> 00:42:40,362
And I agree with the resolution.

433
00:42:40,382 --> 00:42:51,594
I think it's a good resolution, but I do think that, like, and I don't think you're trying to do this on purpose, but I think there's unintended consequences that we're really, you know, there's a cost associated with this.

434
00:42:52,815 --> 00:42:56,719
And it's borne by the taxpayer, the person that owns the property.

435
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:59,522
And that's the piece that I guess I'm guarding against.

436
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:13,616
So the only thing I'm saying is if we add the amendment in, we're at least giving some guidance to the Community Development Board to say, you know, there is an amendment here to see what the public thinks about the amendment.

437
00:43:14,477 --> 00:43:22,200
To send them the language, I think we're at least giving them a little bit more guidance if we're actually adding the amendment in as to what we're thinking.

438
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:27,042
I mean, it seems like there's definitely some sort of an appetite for the amendment that was offered.

439
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:28,963
Thank you, Councilmember.

440
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,824
Let's give the clerk the language for the amendments.

441
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:37,712
Mr. Okay, on the motion by Council.

442
00:43:37,732 --> 00:43:39,633
What information, Mr. President?

443
00:43:40,173 --> 00:43:41,214
What information, Councilor?

444
00:43:41,234 --> 00:43:51,918
Can you table it and let him write the amendment and then we can take it up next week?

445
00:43:51,978 --> 00:43:58,901
I'm not comfortable, Mr. President, sending a paper to the board or a commission asking them to do something if we don't have the language for them to look at it.

446
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,262
This is a zoning issue.

447
00:44:00,322 --> 00:44:02,483
It's not like we're asking them to fix a pothole on, you know what I mean?

448
00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:05,053
Smith Street, you know what I mean?

449
00:44:05,093 --> 00:44:05,794
This is a big deal.

450
00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:08,397
So I think that if we're going to do it, we have to do it right.

451
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:13,081
And we have to have everything in a nice little box with some Christmas wrapping paper on it and a bow when they get it.

452
00:44:13,101 --> 00:44:20,468
Name and address for the record, please.

453
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:22,550
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

454
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,851
I live at 281 Park Street.

455
00:44:26,192 --> 00:44:32,776
I'm always in favor of expanded notification, and I think I like the part in here about the text message or the phone call.

456
00:44:32,876 --> 00:44:35,898
As we all know, reverse 9-1-1 calls cost pennies.

457
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:45,444
So if you ask someone to make 400 reverse 9-1-1 calls, we're talking about $4 to $10, which I don't think is exorbitant.

458
00:44:46,065 --> 00:44:49,247
And then 400 neighbors get to get notification of a project.

459
00:44:49,727 --> 00:45:02,734
I think that any project that is adding a housing unit, there should be an expanded notification because if you live next door to a single family and it's going to be a two or a three, that's going to be a big difference.

460
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:07,356
If you live half a block down from that house, that's going to be a big difference on your street.

461
00:45:07,396 --> 00:45:11,058
A lot of us lives on streets where parking is difficult.

462
00:45:11,538 --> 00:45:12,299
We face the

463
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,261
Every time there's a snow emergency, it's where am I going to put my car?

464
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:26,646
If you start adding housing units onto streets, people are going to want to have input onto whether or not there's going to be parking, because that's the most common variance that's granted when these units are added.

465
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:27,886
Excuse me, Mrs. Rodriguez.

466
00:45:27,946 --> 00:45:31,188
Mr. Pignoli, if you're going to film, please film from the notified area, please.

467
00:45:31,668 --> 00:45:32,008
Thank you.

468
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:33,209
I apologize.

469
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:34,852
Okay.

470
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:38,813
So I think that we should just strive for more notification.

471
00:45:38,873 --> 00:45:44,774
I would love to see the agendas for the zoning board on the front page of the website.

472
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:46,814
I would love to see them read here at meetings.

473
00:45:47,955 --> 00:45:51,615
We really need to find a way for people to know because we're chasing these things.

474
00:45:51,976 --> 00:46:03,618
I was at the building department last week and I asked them if there was a way for me to find out about permit refusals because the most common question that people are asking online about zoning is how do we find out about these projects before they get to the ZBA?

475
00:46:04,038 --> 00:46:05,799
because once they get there, it feels too late.

476
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:13,163
Currently, unless you know the address of a project that's received a permit refusal, you cannot find out what the permit refusals are in the city.

477
00:46:13,763 --> 00:46:19,346
So that's an obstacle that we have to face and that we're chasing down as we're seeing more and more units.

478
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:26,811
We're seeing zoning ordinances being written by our mayor and I'm very concerned as are many, many of our residents.

479
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:27,371
Thank you.

480
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:27,731
Thank you.

481
00:46:28,491 --> 00:46:29,172
Council Member Kern.

482
00:46:31,357 --> 00:46:32,438
The motion is on the floor.

483
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:33,739
Oh, excuse me.

484
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,741
Name and address of the record, please.

485
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:37,202
My name is John Elliott.

486
00:46:37,242 --> 00:46:39,884
I live at 34 Emery Street on the hillside.

487
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:44,508
I'm in favor of expanding the notification area as well.

488
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:49,892
And that's primarily, if you'd asked me a year ago, I might not have felt so strongly.

489
00:46:50,733 --> 00:47:06,439
My opinion is heavily influenced by the fact that I live just over 300 feet from the closest house in what's being called the Capon Village.

490
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,012
It's just by that luck of the draw that I got notification.

491
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:14,133
That's a huge project.

492
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:15,693
I wouldn't have known.

493
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:21,836
My next door neighbor didn't get notification because he's over the 300-foot line.

494
00:47:22,997 --> 00:47:27,299
I think it's worthwhile that people know what's going on in their neighborhoods.

495
00:47:27,759 --> 00:47:34,102
I think sunlight is a good thing to have, and more sunlight is an even better thing to have.

496
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:39,634
I'm certain that 300 feet isn't enough in all cases.

497
00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:43,657
I'm not even sure that 400 feet is enough in some cases.

498
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:51,385
Emery Street is a thousand feet long and it's one way and it's only a block and a half.

499
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:56,330
Anybody who lives in the first block is going to drive by or walk by

500
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:03,362
houses that are at the beginning, and they're going to be affected one way or the other.

501
00:48:04,143 --> 00:48:19,672
I think it's important to let as many people as, you know, you shouldn't let the whole city know, but there's, as I think the solicitor was saying, it's drawing the line, and I think the 300 foot line is too short.

502
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:23,927
and maybe the 400 feet is enough.

503
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:25,490
It's the right direction.

504
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:25,950
Thank you.

505
00:48:26,191 --> 00:48:26,531
Thank you.

506
00:48:27,192 --> 00:48:29,496
Council Member Kern, motion is on the floor.

507
00:48:29,697 --> 00:48:31,279
I didn't know if anybody else wanted to speak, I think.

508
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:36,859
Name, address, or the record, please.

509
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:39,360
Elizabeth Bale, 34 Emory Street.

510
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,541
I appreciate this discussion.

511
00:48:41,742 --> 00:48:44,503
I think that some really good points are being made.

512
00:48:44,523 --> 00:48:51,988
And I would appreciate some language that draws the line with this.

513
00:48:52,948 --> 00:48:55,630
And I'm not sure what that should be.

514
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,091
For example, on our street, Emory Street,

515
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:19,918
Change that if there's a definite changeover going on from single-family houses being changed to multifamily houses Which are being snapped up by absentee landlords that are renting to students that has changed the nature of our street drastically, and it really

516
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:25,421
has a negative effect on our quality of life.

517
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:41,630
So I'm just submitting that as an example, along with Councilor Mangocon's point about changing from a, say, from a two-family to a three-family, or especially, I feel, a single-family to a multi-family.

518
00:49:42,211 --> 00:49:45,893
It really, things that can change the character of a neighborhood,

519
00:49:48,894 --> 00:49:52,996
And I can't pretend that I know what the way is.

520
00:49:53,156 --> 00:50:04,621
But I would encourage you to try to find it and to add it, rather than just sending this as written for a public hearing.

521
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:10,383
Because I think people are going to get agitated, to Councilor Falco's point, if you want to add it.

522
00:50:10,643 --> 00:50:13,644
do a deck or something to have to have.

523
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:15,505
It's not the cost, I don't think.

524
00:50:16,065 --> 00:50:27,809
It's just the burden of having a lot of people being able to chime in on a project that shouldn't really, it's not really going to affect their lives versus one that will.

525
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:30,490
So that's all I have to say.

526
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:35,271
Thanks very much for bringing this up and discussing the consequences.

527
00:50:38,456 --> 00:50:40,577
Thank you, President Carviello.

528
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:51,706
I guess to my two colleagues that want to do the site plan review, my question would be, what about notice with regards to any unit, any housing unit?

529
00:50:52,487 --> 00:50:54,529
You still think that's too much notice?

530
00:50:55,850 --> 00:51:02,115
Versus six plus, what about any unit, any housing unit?

531
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:02,375
Yeah.

532
00:51:02,555 --> 00:51:04,397
Councilor Falco.

533
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:11,841
If I may, because I think that is definitely a legitimate concern about when you're adding units to existing units.

534
00:51:12,661 --> 00:51:15,183
So if we can work on a compromise, I'm all for it.

535
00:51:16,023 --> 00:51:24,168
So I was wondering, City Solicitor Rumley, is there a way that we can, and I'm not sure if you could give us an opinion on this, but you know,

536
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:33,854
Right now, if the amendment is to only apply where site plan review is required, can we also put, or if, you know, something.

537
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:35,195
A housing unit is to be added.

538
00:51:35,255 --> 00:51:43,280
Yeah, or if an existing unit is adding additional units, can we, or if you have a recommendation as to some order.

539
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,982
Well, I've listened and done my share of speaking tonight.

540
00:51:47,362 --> 00:51:49,724
The line can be drawn a whole bunch of places.

541
00:51:50,910 --> 00:52:17,215
So I would suggest, and I don't know how you feel about this, that you just send the resolution up with an amendment that says that the city council suggests or recommends that the planning board discuss viable alternatives for the applicability of this expanded notification, such as

542
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:29,025
applying it only to projects that are subject to site plan review, or the conversion of housing to more units than it presently has.

543
00:52:29,906 --> 00:52:30,626
Something like that.

544
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:30,706
Yes.

545
00:52:30,907 --> 00:52:32,948
That's the best I can come up with off the top of my head.

546
00:52:32,988 --> 00:52:33,409
Move approval.

547
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:34,710
I didn't write it down.

548
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,151
Yes, as amended.

549
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:37,012
Did you get that, Mr. Finn?

550
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:41,355
Can we add that as the, I mean I'd be fine with that amendment.

551
00:52:41,395 --> 00:52:41,895
Yes we could.

552
00:52:42,155 --> 00:52:42,776
Did you get that?

553
00:52:43,396 --> 00:52:58,084
So on the motion, on the motion by Councilor O'Connor, as amended that the City Council ask for viable alternatives to housing.

554
00:52:59,065 --> 00:53:00,026
For applicability.

555
00:53:00,586 --> 00:53:02,547
Housing applicability.

556
00:53:04,628 --> 00:53:07,131
As amended by Councilor Lococo, as amended.

557
00:53:08,012 --> 00:53:09,454
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

558
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:10,034
Roll call.

559
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,257
Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

560
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,319
Refer to this OCD board.

561
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:14,680
We did it!

562
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:14,960
Woo!

563
00:53:34,022 --> 00:53:34,922
Councilor DelaRusso?

564
00:53:35,022 --> 00:53:35,323
Yes.

565
00:53:36,223 --> 00:53:36,903
Councilor Falco?

566
00:53:37,003 --> 00:53:37,163
Yes.

567
00:53:37,803 --> 00:53:38,444
Councilor Nye?

568
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:38,864
Yes.

569
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:40,224
Councilor Kerr?

570
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:40,364
Yes.

571
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:42,985
Vice President Martins?

572
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:43,105
Yes.

573
00:53:43,145 --> 00:53:43,786
Councilor Scott Pelli?

574
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:44,946
Yes.

575
00:53:45,206 --> 00:53:48,828
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

576
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:49,848
Motion passes.

577
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:55,410
Motion to be referred back to regular business by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

578
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:56,230
All those in favor?

579
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,071
Motion passes.

580
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:00,432
Public hearing 17782.

581
00:54:01,012 --> 00:54:02,213
A public hearing will be held

582
00:54:03,293 --> 00:54:10,680
by the Memphis City Council in the Howard F. Alden Memorial Chamber, City Hall, Memphis Mass on Tuesday, December 12th, 2017 at 7 o'clock p.m.

583
00:54:15,306 --> 00:54:25,152
The purpose of the hearing is to hear the Board of Assessors on the following items for the purpose of the allocation of the fiscal year 2018 property tax.

584
00:54:25,252 --> 00:54:29,094
One, to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2018.

585
00:54:29,154 --> 00:54:32,456
Two, to select an open space discount.

586
00:54:32,516 --> 00:54:35,838
Three, to select a residential exemption.

587
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:39,660
And four, to select a small commercial exemption.

588
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:50,039
Call 781-393-242501 for any combinations to see if Meffitt is an equal opportunity employer.

589
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:51,700
It would be Finn Clark.

590
00:54:56,944 --> 00:55:00,547
All those in favor of the

591
00:55:02,428 --> 00:55:05,309
accepting the tax recommendations.

592
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:06,449
This is a public hearing.

593
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,349
Name and address for the record, please.

594
00:55:08,769 --> 00:55:11,950
Yes, Alicia Nunley Benjamin, Finance Director, Auditor for the City of Medford.

595
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:16,491
And Kenneth Stein, Interim Assessor for the Board of Assessors.

596
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:17,771
Thank you.

597
00:55:20,511 --> 00:55:25,812
Tonight, I'd like you to accept the residential factor at 0.906926, which will produce the 175% shift.

598
00:55:41,892 --> 00:55:46,136
I'm sorry, okay.

599
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,079
The residential factor for this evening is 0.906, 926, which will produce a 175% shift.

600
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:52,382
On the motion, on the motion to, I'm sorry.

601
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:09,889
on the motion by Councilor Knight to accept the residential factor.

602
00:56:10,129 --> 00:56:11,490
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

603
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,291
All those in favor?

604
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:17,154
Motion passes.

605
00:56:18,395 --> 00:56:19,696
I'm sorry.

606
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:25,380
It's the public hearing at the moment, Mr. Storaro.

607
00:56:27,202 --> 00:56:30,204
Motion passed before there was any discussion.

608
00:56:31,515 --> 00:56:39,084
and I didn't hear the councilors discuss this and I didn't hear the audience invited up to it being a public hearing.

609
00:56:39,725 --> 00:56:40,867
Motion for reconsideration.

610
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,719
I did have some comments here, and it seemed like you gathered my papers here.

611
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,540
Point of order, Mr. President.

612
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,160
Yes, Mr. Tillerson.

613
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:05,582
We in the public forum of the public hearing, are those in opposition or are those in favor, Mr. President?

614
00:57:06,042 --> 00:57:07,943
Mr. Estrella is in opposition.

615
00:57:08,203 --> 00:57:08,663
Opposition.

616
00:57:09,143 --> 00:57:09,383
Correct.

617
00:57:09,983 --> 00:57:12,104
No, I'm not in opposition, I'm neutral.

618
00:57:12,705 --> 00:57:17,167
But I do want it discussed on an information basis.

619
00:57:17,647 --> 00:57:28,173
I want the councillors who already know all about this, but the audience out there, the people, they don't understand this, most of my say.

620
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:30,214
We have to know if there's anyone else in opposition first.

621
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:31,414
Okay, go ahead.

622
00:57:31,454 --> 00:57:33,535
Is there anyone else in opposition to the Residential Tenement?

623
00:57:33,555 --> 00:57:34,596
By the way, I'm not in opposition.

624
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:36,177
Okay, so you're in favor of it.

625
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:40,280
No, I want to speak after the meeting.

626
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,800
Okay, this is a public hearing, Dr. Straub.

627
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:53,502
So you're either in favor or you're opposed.

628
00:57:53,602 --> 00:57:55,083
I'm in favor of an understanding.

629
00:57:55,243 --> 00:57:56,503
Thank you.

630
00:57:56,523 --> 00:57:56,903
Okay.

631
00:57:57,003 --> 00:57:59,023
And you can come back and speak after we.

632
00:57:59,163 --> 00:57:59,784
Certainly.

633
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,084
Is there anyone in opposition?

634
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,444
I await your invitation.

635
00:58:03,744 --> 00:58:05,185
Thank you.

636
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:06,305
Is there anyone in opposition?

637
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:12,120
Hearing and seeing none, we motion that by the hearing closed.

638
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:15,642
Okay, now you can address.

639
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:18,403
Mr. President, point of order.

640
00:58:19,384 --> 00:58:20,364
Councilor Del Rosso.

641
00:58:20,444 --> 00:58:24,146
Are we now in the portion of the meeting that we can openly discuss and debate?

642
00:58:24,186 --> 00:58:24,546
Yes, we are.

643
00:58:25,046 --> 00:58:26,347
The format is before us.

644
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:27,388
Yes, we are.

645
00:58:27,548 --> 00:58:27,908
Thank you.

646
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,099
Name and address of the record, please.

647
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:31,120
Thank you, Councilor De La Ruza.

648
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:36,201
My name is John Starella, and I reside at 20 Metcalf Street, right here in Medford.

649
00:58:36,782 --> 00:58:40,283
And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak.

650
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:53,948
And thank you to the City Council, which I would like to thank individually for the opportunity to exercise our First Amendment right, freedom of speech.

651
00:58:56,428 --> 00:58:58,049
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

652
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:01,723
Thank you, Councilor Longo-Kern.

653
00:59:02,784 --> 00:59:04,805
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

654
00:59:05,506 --> 00:59:06,847
Thank you, Councilor Mox.

655
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:09,229
Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

656
00:59:09,689 --> 00:59:11,891
Thank you, Councilor Fankel.

657
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:16,995
The property tax has already been passed.

658
00:59:18,276 --> 00:59:20,918
It was passed in June of 2017.

659
00:59:21,299 --> 00:59:23,661
That was six months ago.

660
00:59:24,682 --> 00:59:28,565
It was passed by a unanimous vote of the City Council

661
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:45,212
At $109.5 million, the most allowed, all seven councilors voted and the mayor approved a $54 million increase in the property tax.

662
00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:50,176
I mean, I'm sorry, I want to correct that, a $4 million increase.

663
00:59:51,117 --> 00:59:53,039
Because last year it was $105 million, this year it's $109 million.

664
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:03,019
The council passed the same $4 million increase in June of 2016.

665
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:04,060
Again, in June of 2017.

666
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:14,516
and is already scheduled to do it again in June of 2018.

667
01:00:16,057 --> 01:00:23,783
We can predict right now that this city council will pass a $4 million increase in June of 2018.

668
01:00:25,464 --> 01:00:30,909
Now, the reason the council does that is because you cannot run the city without that increase.

669
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:32,270
You cannot pay the help.

670
01:00:33,693 --> 01:00:36,117
So, it must be passed with that increase.

671
01:00:36,738 --> 01:00:44,471
That's why we went from $105 million last year for a property tax to $109.5 million this year.

672
01:00:50,622 --> 01:00:52,102
Let's catch up here.

673
01:00:52,863 --> 01:01:03,965
Now, without the annual property tax, as I said, without that increase, the Memphis City government will not be able to adequately compensate our loyal civil servants.

674
01:01:05,305 --> 01:01:12,307
So, if the highest ever property tax is already the law, why are we here?

675
01:01:14,288 --> 01:01:15,908
That's what the discussion is about.

676
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:25,619
The city council is here now to decide who will pay for the property tax.

677
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:27,720
That's what's gonna be determined tonight.

678
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,701
Not whether or not there is a tax, not how much the tax is.

679
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:33,462
We've already decided how much it is.

680
01:01:34,142 --> 01:01:37,303
This council is gonna decide who is going to pay for it.

681
01:01:37,383 --> 01:01:39,523
By the way, it's not paid equally.

682
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:44,685
It is decided on a sometimes political basis.

683
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:51,459
The council would choose who among our tax groups will pay and how much each group will pay.

684
01:01:51,479 --> 01:02:00,123
The 109, oh, by the way, Mr. President, this does not carry on for long, so please bear with me.

685
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:10,708
The $109 million property tax, if divided evenly and fairly, would come to a rate of $11.30 for each $1,000 of assessed property.

686
01:02:12,089 --> 01:02:13,110
That seems fair.

687
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,411
The minimum commercial shift

688
01:02:16,647 --> 01:02:17,487
in the state law.

689
01:02:17,507 --> 01:02:22,128
Now when I say commercial, I'm talking about CIPs, commercial, industrial, and personal property.

690
01:02:23,389 --> 01:02:25,829
The minimum commercial shift in the state law is 1.75.

691
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:30,430
I mean, you can't shift less than that.

692
01:02:31,611 --> 01:02:34,351
And that makes the minimum residential factor 90.7.

693
01:02:35,912 --> 01:02:40,533
That's what Auditor Nunley was referring to.

694
01:02:41,616 --> 01:02:46,342
leaving the commercials that have 10% of the property to pay 20% of the tax.

695
01:02:46,402 --> 01:02:47,403
Now think of that.

696
01:02:48,024 --> 01:02:52,429
The commercials have only 10% of the property, but they pay 20% of the tax.

697
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:58,376
The residents, that's all of us, who own 90% of the property pay only 80% of the tax.

698
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:10,171
I don't know if that's fair, but that is saving, is a saving which the council later takes away from our residents.

699
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:27,095
Now, the council wants to help the residents by having them pay less than the commercials, but later on it takes that away if, and this way the two are connected, if it does not pass the residential exemption, the 35% exemption has gotta be passed too.

700
01:03:27,475 --> 01:03:32,416
That's why these have to be discussed mutually, together, at the same time.

701
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:36,438
Do you see how convoluted the government has made this?

702
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:40,721
The commercials are the ones who invest their money in Medford.

703
01:03:41,561 --> 01:03:42,702
They build the squares.

704
01:03:43,783 --> 01:03:48,005
They provide the services and provide jobs to Medford residents.

705
01:03:49,046 --> 01:03:53,369
And they, the commercials, are punished by the city.

706
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:55,090
Pardon me.

707
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:08,995
Now, with reference to the residential exemption, if the residential exemption allows residents to pay less of the property tax and the commercials to pay more, guess what?

708
01:04:09,796 --> 01:04:13,240
If residential, if the residential exemption of 35% is not passed,

709
01:04:15,703 --> 01:04:33,469
Those same residents who are owner-occupiers would be deprived of the tax gain which the council wanted to award them, and it would be given to the non-occupying investors who are already collecting huge rents at big profits, up to $3,000 a month for an apartment.

710
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:41,293
So the resident taxpayers bear the burden of the property tax.

711
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:44,636
Is that what the city council wants?

712
01:04:44,836 --> 01:04:53,122
The city council wants the residents to think that they are favoring them, and then by not passing the residential exemption, they take that away.

713
01:04:55,363 --> 01:05:01,668
Anyway, to conclude, they always say that, don't they, to conclude.

714
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:03,321
But they go on.

715
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:06,376
A residential exemption.

716
01:05:07,852 --> 01:05:12,895
would save the owner-occupied properties $800 to $1,000 a year, that's all.

717
01:05:13,255 --> 01:05:15,857
People are paying $5,000, $6,000 in taxes.

718
01:05:16,157 --> 01:05:23,361
Now this saves the people who own their homes and occupy them somewhere from $800 to $1,000 a year.

719
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:33,847
The assessor could not come up with a number, but this is a reasonable number, and it seems that the average tax say is $5,000 to $6,000.

720
01:05:33,907 --> 01:05:34,487
This would save them,

721
01:05:36,648 --> 01:05:46,655
If you live in a single family house and you occupy it, your tax would, instead of being say $5,000, would be $4,200.

722
01:05:47,516 --> 01:06:04,828
The cities in the area already using, now there are cities already using this residential exemption are Chelsea, Somerville, Boston, Cambridge, Malden, Everett, Waltham, and Watertown.

723
01:06:05,949 --> 01:06:07,231
Thank you, Mr. President.

724
01:06:07,251 --> 01:06:08,052
Thank you, Dr. Straub.

725
01:06:08,072 --> 01:06:09,033
Thank you, Dr. Straub.

726
01:06:11,557 --> 01:06:11,917
Thank you.

727
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:14,020
Thank you.

728
01:06:15,182 --> 01:06:15,963
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

729
01:06:15,983 --> 01:06:16,864
You ready?

730
01:06:16,904 --> 01:06:19,588
Motion to approve, Mr. President.

731
01:06:19,848 --> 01:06:20,129
Thank you.

732
01:06:24,285 --> 01:06:29,628
Apologize, can you go over the number one again sure to determine the residential factor to be used in fiscal year?

733
01:06:29,648 --> 01:06:31,669
2018 what's the number again?

734
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:35,290
It's the number for the residential factor is zero point nine.

735
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:40,553
Oh six nine two six to produce to produce the hundred and seventy five percent shift.

736
01:06:40,573 --> 01:06:40,593
I

737
01:06:43,998 --> 01:06:47,579
on the motion to accept the residential factor.

738
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:50,020
With the roll call, Mr. President.

739
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:50,740
Roll call.

740
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,000
Councilor Lengelkran.

741
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,361
Thank you, President Carviello, and thank you, Dr. Storillo, for your speech.

742
01:06:57,862 --> 01:07:10,865
I think the residential factor was brought up by Dr. Storillo, and it's something we discussed in depth today at our Committee of the Whole meeting at 6 and last week, and I thank the consultant and Ms.

743
01:07:10,885 --> 01:07:11,885
Nunley for giving us

744
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:22,219
answers to all the questions we did ask and that fifth document we did want was a breakdown of the break even point and I just think it's worth some

745
01:07:23,977 --> 01:07:39,062
a summary or some clarification for the viewing public because I know once a month I feel like I get an email, why doesn't Medford have the residential exemption when it comes to owner-occupied versus non-owner-occupied?

746
01:07:39,582 --> 01:07:47,785
And the answer I always give is because although we'd be helping the owner-occupied parcels, we'd also be burdening

747
01:07:48,603 --> 01:07:57,787
about this year would be about 1,300 properties that are above $720,000.

748
01:07:58,228 --> 01:08:00,689
And that's always the answer that I give.

749
01:08:01,189 --> 01:08:03,090
But sometimes it's almost not good enough.

750
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,991
And there are a lot of people struggling, I think, on both ends.

751
01:08:06,091 --> 01:08:11,834
And this council's never adopted the residential owner-occupied exemption.

752
01:08:12,014 --> 01:08:13,835
And I think it's just

753
01:08:14,615 --> 01:08:17,958
It's good for the public to know that we are going to look into getting new data.

754
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:27,765
Our data is five to six years old and we did request at our Committee of the Whole meeting to get new data so we can get better, more clear and accurate numbers.

755
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:33,289
Because if you look at a property that is worth a million dollars, if we took the shift at 5%

756
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:37,506
they'd be paying about an extra $110.

757
01:08:37,726 --> 01:08:42,389
If we took it at 20%, they'd be paying an extra $500.

758
01:08:42,509 --> 01:08:48,594
And that's, I think, something that's obviously the sticking point of doing this shift that a number of communities do do.

759
01:08:48,614 --> 01:08:58,480
So I don't know if you could add anything else just to educate the public a little more, because it is something that a lot of people do ask us, please accept this shift.

760
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:01,903
And we're left explaining time after time after time.

761
01:09:02,543 --> 01:09:03,564
what the issues are.

762
01:09:03,804 --> 01:09:07,166
It's a program that's revenue neutral for the city.

763
01:09:08,006 --> 01:09:23,635
What it does is only within the residential class, it cuts the taxes of those properties qualifying as owner-occupied, and to make up for that, increases the tax on two classes of property.

764
01:09:23,895 --> 01:09:26,277
One, those that are above that so-called

765
01:09:27,237 --> 01:09:45,324
break-even point that are still worse off with a residential exemption than if the city didn't have it, and it also increases the tax on all those properties that don't qualify for the residential exemption, particularly rental properties, apartments, and so forth.

766
01:09:46,504 --> 01:10:01,692
So it's a cost-benefit analysis and an economic analysis for the council each year to determine is it worth the benefit to those people that qualify to increase the taxes on those people that don't qualify.

767
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:09,996
And of the 351 towns and cities, right now I think only 13 actually have adopted it.

768
01:10:12,183 --> 01:10:12,503
Thank you.

769
01:10:12,703 --> 01:10:19,406
And with regard to that, we did take a vote to get more updated data.

770
01:10:19,846 --> 01:10:20,867
And I believe, Ms.

771
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:25,649
Nunley, you did say that that is something the city is willing to pursue if the mayor and the council.

772
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:27,710
Yes, the administration is absolutely open to that.

773
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:48,066
So I just want to put that on record that we were told that the city is going to pursue getting us more accurate data and I think that will allow us with this breakdown number five of what we have in our packet I think updated data having this as well as what the savings would be for the owner occupied under 720 or whatever that number may be next year.

774
01:10:48,566 --> 01:10:54,492
I think we can make a more educated decision on whether or not to do it or maybe try it at 5% or whatnot.

775
01:10:54,552 --> 01:10:57,355
And I think that's just important to point out that we are looking into it.

776
01:10:57,415 --> 01:11:02,680
We've looked into it, I think, two times in depth in the past 10 plus years.

777
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:09,326
And I think if we can get this more updated data, it's something we can definitely think about again next year.

778
01:11:09,827 --> 01:11:10,147
Thank you.

779
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:10,788
Vice President Mox.

780
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,191
Thank you, Mr. President.

781
01:11:14,992 --> 01:11:23,096
As was stated, this has been an issue before this council for, geez, the last probably five to eight years regarding a residential exemption.

782
01:11:23,796 --> 01:11:26,877
And my stance has always been the same, Mr. President.

783
01:11:27,898 --> 01:11:37,783
You know, in theory, it sounds great if you can shift to those that aren't living in their property and using them as income.

784
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:48,125
you know, that are living outside this community, or maybe even inside this community that have rental apartments, shift the burden to them and take it off the people that live in their homes.

785
01:11:48,585 --> 01:11:49,786
That sounds perfect.

786
01:11:50,326 --> 01:11:51,226
Sign me up for it.

787
01:11:51,886 --> 01:11:54,227
Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.

788
01:11:54,707 --> 01:12:08,190
And what we've been told by the assessor's office, not only this year, but in past years, there's roughly a thousand or some homes in the community that will not get this benefit that actually live in their home.

789
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:18,936
So if you're above the $720,000, I believe it is, assessed value, you could potentially pay more, even though you live in your home and we're giving out exemptions.

790
01:12:19,497 --> 01:12:20,757
To me, that is unfair.

791
01:12:21,678 --> 01:12:23,939
I cannot support that, Mr. President.

792
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:30,124
care of the lion's share of people living in their homes, but what about the other percent?

793
01:12:30,545 --> 01:12:34,488
I represent everyone in this community, and in my opinion, it's not fair.

794
01:12:35,108 --> 01:12:41,433
And the second point is that you have many elderly people in this community that are property rich.

795
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:47,980
So you may have someone that bought their home 55, 60 years ago, and their home is assessed at $800,000, $900,000.

796
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:54,347
And the woman is living there by herself now on a fixed income.

797
01:12:54,947 --> 01:12:55,568
And guess what?

798
01:12:56,109 --> 01:13:03,216
Based on what we're being presented for this exemption, that particular woman living by herself in a $900,000 house, she's property rich,

799
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:08,199
would pay more under that proposal.

800
01:13:08,659 --> 01:13:09,859
And I cannot support that.

801
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,300
I cannot support that.

802
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:20,423
Someday, like other communities, it'll average out, like they do in Malden and Somerville and Cambridge, that there are a fair number of

803
01:13:21,403 --> 01:13:26,725
a non-owner occupied in the city, that you could shift the entire burden to them.

804
01:13:27,365 --> 01:13:29,386
We in this community don't have that shift yet.

805
01:13:29,846 --> 01:13:31,387
It doesn't work for our community yet.

806
01:13:31,747 --> 01:13:32,547
Someday it may.

807
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:36,769
At the rate, you know, properties go in this community, it may work that way.

808
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:46,892
But currently right now, Mr. President, I cannot support that because it leaves out over 1,000 homeowners in this community that will fall above the $720,000

809
01:13:49,573 --> 01:13:53,235
and that live in their property, and that they will end up paying more.

810
01:13:53,715 --> 01:14:02,558
So that's where I stand, Mr. President, on this, and I appreciate the fact that we will get updated information, and maybe next year or the following year, who knows?

811
01:14:03,059 --> 01:14:10,342
At that point, it may work, and I'll be the first to vote to shift it to the non-owned occupier, but not at this point, Mr. President.

812
01:14:10,562 --> 01:14:11,522
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

813
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:17,965
On the first question, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

814
01:14:20,672 --> 01:14:21,935
What is the question, sir?

815
01:14:22,336 --> 01:14:26,207
The question is to determine the residential factor to be used in fiscal year 2018.

816
01:14:31,605 --> 01:14:32,686
Dr. Strauss, do you have something to add?

817
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:36,869
Yes, I wanna respond to what the counselors have said.

818
01:14:37,829 --> 01:14:41,852
They are very much concerned about the 1,000 people who will pay more.

819
01:14:41,872 --> 01:14:45,795
And we talk about $900,000 value homes.

820
01:14:46,175 --> 01:14:48,196
How many of those are there in Medford, please?

821
01:14:48,237 --> 01:14:48,597
Awful lot.

822
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:49,437
How many?

823
01:14:49,758 --> 01:14:50,398
An awful lot.

824
01:14:50,678 --> 01:14:51,339
How many, well.

825
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:52,379
1,300 at the moment.

826
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:54,141
All right, now if you wanna talk about the 1,000.

827
01:14:54,181 --> 01:14:54,141
1,300. 1,300.

828
01:14:58,003 --> 01:14:58,724
All right, 1,300.

829
01:14:59,004 --> 01:15:04,406
Well, there are 13,000 which are unoccupied.

830
01:15:04,426 --> 01:15:07,728
1,300 on one side, 13,000 on the other side.

831
01:15:08,388 --> 01:15:11,090
I think this council should take care of the majority of the people.

832
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,190
My opinion, Mr. President.

833
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,591
Point of information, Councilor Naith.

834
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:25,159
I think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that the assessor's office in their presentation noted that the data that they were using to determine how many homes in this community were owner-occupied was certainly outdated.

835
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:28,880
Therefore, all the data that was generated is garbage in, garbage out.

836
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,920
So we really don't have an accurate representation.

837
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,861
All we know is that based on the materials that we had before us this evening, we weren't ready to go forward.

838
01:15:35,161 --> 01:15:43,683
We recognize the fact that the information that we had before us was deficient, and we're asking the administration to go forward and get us the appropriate information so that in the future we can make an informed decision.

839
01:15:43,703 --> 01:15:44,483
That is correct.

840
01:15:44,743 --> 01:15:45,543
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

841
01:15:46,344 --> 01:15:47,524
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

842
01:15:49,765 --> 01:15:51,025
Councilor Dela Rousseau.

843
01:15:51,225 --> 01:15:51,586
Yes.

844
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:53,106
Councilor Falcone.

845
01:15:53,486 --> 01:15:53,706
Yes.

846
01:15:54,186 --> 01:15:54,707
Councilor Knight.

847
01:15:54,907 --> 01:15:55,187
Yes.

848
01:15:55,747 --> 01:15:56,547
Councilor Locke-Kern.

849
01:15:57,068 --> 01:15:57,188
Yes.

850
01:15:58,008 --> 01:15:58,768
Vice President Monk.

851
01:15:59,248 --> 01:15:59,568
Yes.

852
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:00,949
Councilor Scott Pelley.

853
01:16:01,069 --> 01:16:01,329
Yes.

854
01:16:01,789 --> 01:16:02,450
President Caviello.

855
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:02,690
Yes.

856
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:04,990
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

857
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:08,692
Number two, to select an open space discount.

858
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:15,094
We don't have any open space currently classified in measure.

859
01:16:15,134 --> 01:16:16,174
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

860
01:16:16,674 --> 01:16:19,355
Do not adopt the open space discounts.

861
01:16:19,455 --> 01:16:20,735
Councilor Del Rosso.

862
01:16:39,688 --> 01:16:43,470
I'm on the agenda, it says select an open space discount.

863
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,531
We don't have one.

864
01:16:46,551 --> 01:16:50,652
The way the clerk put it was the motion by Councilor Nantz did not adopt.

865
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:53,393
So my motion would be to make a motion to do it in full favor.

866
01:16:53,453 --> 01:16:59,196
This here, the old language is different than we have where I used to speak to it.

867
01:16:59,276 --> 01:17:00,976
So Councilor Nantz did not adopt.

868
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:04,698
And yes, vote would not adopt the open space discount.

869
01:17:06,909 --> 01:17:09,631
I'm just saying turn their microphones on, people are wondering what they're saying.

870
01:17:12,413 --> 01:17:17,598
A yes vote would not adopt the open space discount, am I correct?

871
01:17:18,518 --> 01:17:24,763
The motion that was made was a motion to not adopt, which would mean that the yes vote would be the negative on the question.

872
01:17:26,885 --> 01:17:28,606
That is the motion, yay.

873
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,081
Councilor Falco.

874
01:17:32,701 --> 01:17:32,901
Yes.

875
01:17:33,522 --> 01:17:34,062
Councilor Naik.

876
01:17:34,162 --> 01:17:34,423
Yes.

877
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:35,764
Councilor Kerr.

878
01:17:35,924 --> 01:17:36,164
Yes.

879
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:37,425
Vice President Marks.

880
01:17:37,505 --> 01:17:37,806
Yes.

881
01:17:38,246 --> 01:17:38,966
Councilor Scott Pelley.

882
01:17:39,047 --> 01:17:39,327
Yes.

883
01:17:39,787 --> 01:17:40,428
President Caviello.

884
01:17:40,768 --> 01:17:43,190
Yes, seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.

885
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:48,254
Number three, to select a residential exemption.

886
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:58,343
Motion by Councilor Naik not to adopt a residential exemption.

887
01:18:02,113 --> 01:18:03,195
We have someone who would like to speak.

888
01:18:03,556 --> 01:18:04,718
Name and address of the record, please.

889
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:11,108
Thank you, Honorable Council President.

890
01:18:11,429 --> 01:18:15,095
Andrew Castanetti, Cushion Street, Method, Massachusetts.

891
01:18:16,923 --> 01:18:18,284
I'm a little bit disconnected here.

892
01:18:18,304 --> 01:18:19,664
I had to go home for some papers.

893
01:18:21,005 --> 01:18:30,870
And the information that I received today was actually not the answer I was looking for from the assessor's office.

894
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:35,432
So first of all, good evening, honorable counselors.

895
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:42,599
Please bear with me, because I'm a bit disconnected here.

896
01:18:43,699 --> 01:18:57,924
This is probably my seventh and a half year that I've come here for this month of December, as you set the tax rate, or proposed to elect a residential owner exemption or not.

897
01:18:59,724 --> 01:19:04,186
And without success in the last 7.5 years that I've come before you, since 2009, I believe.

898
01:19:07,025 --> 01:19:23,498
When I ran for city council, my platform mission was, and still is, which I like to pass out, because some councilors had requested my political brochure, so I would like to.

899
01:19:23,519 --> 01:19:25,000
We're not handing out political brochures.

900
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,841
No, this is information.

901
01:19:27,282 --> 01:19:32,366
It's about the real estate tax exemption, and if I may give it to the,

902
01:19:34,498 --> 01:19:40,230
Mr. Clerk, Mr. Lepore, the seven for the council, one specifically for Ms.

903
01:19:40,311 --> 01:19:41,233
Mayor Muccini-Burke.

904
01:19:43,242 --> 01:19:45,343
I would like you to pass them out after I'm done, please.

905
01:19:45,723 --> 01:19:46,123
Not now.

906
01:19:46,803 --> 01:19:48,544
Thank you very much for your consideration.

907
01:19:49,504 --> 01:19:55,347
My priority number one for the community, for the people, is to improve public safety.

908
01:19:55,627 --> 01:19:59,928
Number two, improve maintenance of public buildings and city infrastructure.

909
01:19:59,968 --> 01:20:03,130
Number three, encourage fiscal responsibility.

910
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:06,391
Number four, promote responsible development.

911
01:20:07,691 --> 01:20:08,532
And number five,

912
01:20:10,093 --> 01:20:19,280
My special interest would be to reduce real estate tax bills for owner-occupied.

913
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,362
Andy, I asked you not to give out any political.

914
01:20:22,603 --> 01:20:23,623
This is about the.

915
01:20:23,643 --> 01:20:25,004
This is political literature on here.

916
01:20:26,085 --> 01:20:26,866
That's old news.

917
01:20:26,946 --> 01:20:28,167
It's political literature.

918
01:20:28,187 --> 01:20:31,069
It's just about the owner-occupied exemption.

919
01:20:31,129 --> 01:20:32,010
It's political literature.

920
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:32,690
Number five.

921
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:33,911
Mr. Clerk, please take those back.

922
01:20:33,931 --> 01:20:35,913
It's political literature.

923
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:38,250
You can keep it.

924
01:20:38,411 --> 01:20:39,271
Thank you, Brianna.

925
01:20:39,891 --> 01:20:40,812
That's political literature, Andy.

926
01:20:40,832 --> 01:20:41,773
I asked you not to give it up.

927
01:20:42,733 --> 01:20:43,914
No, it's obsolete.

928
01:20:44,454 --> 01:20:45,795
It's political literature.

929
01:20:46,776 --> 01:20:47,696
Okay, you win.

930
01:20:49,658 --> 01:20:52,940
I still would like to speak on behalf of the majority of the homeowners.

931
01:20:54,541 --> 01:21:05,968
Number five, I would want to reduce real estate tax bills for owner-occupied homeowners by adopting the full 35% under Massachusetts general law

932
01:21:07,752 --> 01:21:25,527
Chapter 59, Section 5C, as it is done, as Dr. Starella said, in Somerville, Malden, Everett, all of Boston, and other area communities, to provide some long overdue tax relief to homeowners.

933
01:21:32,133 --> 01:21:35,536
Please be aware and assured

934
01:21:37,962 --> 01:21:40,243
all seven counselors, and Ms.

935
01:21:40,303 --> 01:21:47,805
Mayor Burke, the city would not lose any real estate tax dollars.

936
01:21:49,246 --> 01:21:56,268
They still will receive the whole real estate tax levy of $109.5 million, as they want, with a 4% increase from last year.

937
01:22:06,423 --> 01:22:21,081
Our savings will simply be paid for by all others, such as absentee, residential only, residential homeowners who are absentee landlords, period.

938
01:22:22,443 --> 01:22:32,514
At the tune of whatever it cost on their bill, I didn't get enough current factual information to write this number in.

939
01:22:33,355 --> 01:22:34,857
However, I may continue.

940
01:22:36,521 --> 01:22:44,605
On average, these absentee owners, they're collecting $2,000 a month rent.

941
01:22:45,005 --> 01:22:51,728
If it's a two family, you're talking $48,000 in rents, even if they had an $800 increase.

942
01:22:53,509 --> 01:22:57,991
They're still generating $48,000 and not living in our neighborhoods.

943
01:23:01,932 --> 01:23:06,774
You, the city councilors and the mayor, have before you an opportunity of a lifetime.

944
01:23:08,134 --> 01:23:21,499
If you adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C, the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption, the people would benefit greatly.

945
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:31,463
Now, I don't have all my information because of other circumstances that I had no control over.

946
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:48,722
However, I have a packet from the assessor's office that was given out a week ago, last Wednesday, and it states the communities and cities and towns that give out this owner-occupied exemption.

947
01:23:50,664 --> 01:23:56,128
And we're talking, as I said, Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville.

948
01:23:57,082 --> 01:24:07,593
And the numbers I'm seeing here that they're saving on real estate tax bills, like the lowest is like $1,400 a year, and that is in Chelsea.

949
01:24:08,234 --> 01:24:15,381
And that is where the interim director of the assessor's office, Mr. Ken Stein, who's here this evening,

950
01:24:16,642 --> 01:24:18,505
was working in that department.

951
01:24:19,366 --> 01:24:25,495
And I just found out this evening that the owner-occupied exemption was in effect prior to him working there in 1999.

952
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:33,460
Wow, this has been around since the millennium.

953
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,440
This is over 17 years.

954
01:24:35,881 --> 01:24:43,884
If we're losing $1,000 a year for the average homeowner, and I'm talking nine out of 10, if you live in the house, that's 90%, 900% batting average.

955
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,484
That's incredible.

956
01:24:49,395 --> 01:25:03,542
And furthermore, if that 10th person has an increase, it may indeed be less of an increase if we were not to adopt wonderful law that was thought up by our Massachusetts legislators.

957
01:25:04,302 --> 01:25:13,447
Finally, they come up with a solution to keep maybe the seniors to be able to afford to live in their town.

958
01:25:15,187 --> 01:25:18,248
because the real estate taxes are just too much for them to carry.

959
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:32,512
And furthermore, I don't want to get off track, but the gentleman, Mr. Ken Stein, the interim assessor, did say Chelsea's been doing it since 19, prior to 1999.

960
01:25:35,032 --> 01:25:36,893
That's a lot of thousand dollar bills every year.

961
01:25:36,913 --> 01:25:44,295
I don't understand why this is not being done here.

962
01:25:46,130 --> 01:26:00,881
But in closing, lots of people, including City Hall employees, especially actually, asked me, why not here in 02155?

963
01:26:01,382 --> 01:26:03,863
I replied, I'm not sure.

964
01:26:04,864 --> 01:26:10,949
So I spoke to Bernie Sanders, and he said, Andrew, the system is rigged.

965
01:26:12,518 --> 01:26:25,228
He said, the political donations come from not you, with the empty two-family home on Cushing Street, it comes from the well-to-do, a la the corporate world, businesses and the like.

966
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:32,794
I hope he's wrong, because we must save the middle class from becoming extinct.

967
01:26:33,995 --> 01:26:39,320
If we're gonna have a society worth a damn, please give the average homeowner

968
01:26:41,831 --> 01:26:48,653
90% of them, a 1,000 plus, who knows how much, can't get a straight answer.

969
01:26:50,353 --> 01:26:50,713
Sad.

970
01:26:50,733 --> 01:26:58,895
Give them a nice present for Christmas for the first time ever in history, and go to 155.

971
01:26:59,335 --> 01:26:59,675
Thank you.

972
01:27:01,435 --> 01:27:03,636
On the motion to accept.

973
01:27:06,532 --> 01:27:07,513
Name and address of the record.

974
01:27:08,073 --> 01:27:10,514
John Sterella, 20 Metcalf Street.

975
01:27:12,095 --> 01:27:17,738
Mr. President, this city council continues to kick this can down the road.

976
01:27:19,659 --> 01:27:26,103
Through parliamentary maneuvers, they push this forward and don't deal with the question.

977
01:27:26,903 --> 01:27:34,968
But someday, I wish one of them would explain to me why they continue to favor millionaire owners

978
01:27:36,325 --> 01:27:50,670
who don't live in Medford, who are collecting as much as $36,000 a year in rents, but they will not help the owner-occupied residents of Medford.

979
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:52,370
Thank you.

980
01:27:55,091 --> 01:27:55,971
Councilor Knight.

981
01:27:56,111 --> 01:27:57,192
Move the question.

982
01:27:57,532 --> 01:28:02,353
On the question, number three, to select a residential exemption.

983
01:28:02,393 --> 01:28:04,054
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

984
01:28:08,296 --> 01:28:09,297
Councilor DelaRusso?

985
01:28:09,357 --> 01:28:09,657
Nay.

986
01:28:13,299 --> 01:28:13,999
Councilor Fevella?

987
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:14,319
No.

988
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:15,860
Councilor Nye?

989
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:16,460
No.

990
01:28:17,681 --> 01:28:18,361
Councilor Lococo?

991
01:28:18,422 --> 01:28:18,662
No.

992
01:28:20,122 --> 01:28:20,843
Vice-President Monk?

993
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:21,323
No.

994
01:28:21,423 --> 01:28:22,944
Councilor Scarpelli?

995
01:28:23,084 --> 01:28:23,184
No.

996
01:28:23,204 --> 01:28:24,805
Vice-President Caviello?

997
01:28:25,105 --> 01:28:25,345
No.

998
01:28:26,086 --> 01:28:28,387
Seven in the negative, motion fails.

999
01:28:28,767 --> 01:28:34,070
Number four, to select a small commercial exemption.

1000
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:37,812
Mr. Stein, none?

1001
01:28:39,195 --> 01:28:48,224
The small commercial exemption is another tax shifting program which shifts tax within the commercial and industrial class only.

1002
01:28:49,205 --> 01:28:55,531
It's a program that needs to be adopted well in advance of the setting of the tax rate because it requires

1003
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:58,074
application.

1004
01:28:58,574 --> 01:29:11,141
It requires certification from the Department of Workforce Development and serves, again, to increase the tax rate to make up for anything that is exempted.

1005
01:29:13,362 --> 01:29:13,702
It says the

1006
01:29:16,637 --> 01:29:33,144
With the approval of the council, may grant a small commercial exemption to all commercial industrial properties occupied by businesses with an average annual employment of no more than 10 people and assessed value of less than a million dollars.

1007
01:29:33,944 --> 01:29:37,567
The exemption may not exceed 10% of the assessed value.

1008
01:29:38,127 --> 01:29:49,016
And to qualify, the director of the Department of Workforce Development must certify that it has an average annual employment of 10 or few people, et cetera, et cetera.

1009
01:29:49,356 --> 01:29:53,379
This is something that can be done, but it would normally be

1010
01:29:54,900 --> 01:30:03,868
begun and analyzed during the summer months and prepared as part of the recap submission against a tax shift.

1011
01:30:03,908 --> 01:30:05,610
Thank you.

1012
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:10,094
On the motion by Councilor Del Rosso to move the question, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1013
01:30:13,937 --> 01:30:14,758
Councilor Del Rosso?

1014
01:30:14,798 --> 01:30:15,098
Nay.

1015
01:30:15,839 --> 01:30:16,620
Councilor Fevella?

1016
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:17,040
No.

1017
01:30:17,921 --> 01:30:18,541
Councilor Nay?

1018
01:30:19,983 --> 01:30:20,603
Councilor Leclerc?

1019
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:29,832
Thank you very much.

1020
01:30:30,332 --> 01:30:30,633
Thank you.

1021
01:30:30,673 --> 01:30:31,273
Vice president box.

1022
01:30:31,414 --> 01:30:33,316
Mr. President, just if I could.

1023
01:30:48,025 --> 01:31:06,850
I believe it's only appropriate, Mr. President, that, and I brought this up during the tax discussion, is that the annual receipts that go into when we set our tax rate, every year we estimate what we're going to bring in in receipts.

1024
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:23,061
And that number is then added to the recapitulation of what happens within our budget, and the estimated receipts

1025
01:31:24,202 --> 01:31:31,867
is usually a lower number, what we expect to bring in, and the tax levy is usually a higher number.

1026
01:31:32,507 --> 01:31:38,751
So every year, because we don't know what we're going to bring in for receipts, we have to estimate and we look at the previous year.

1027
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:47,316
So I think it's only appropriate because we asked for this information, Mr. President, and the assessor's office was kind enough to hand it to us.

1028
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,477
In 2014, we received $13,253,773 in actual receipts for 2014.

1029
01:32:04,942 --> 01:32:06,943
we estimated that we were going to bring in $12,392,303.

1030
01:32:07,003 --> 01:32:08,663
So we were off, we were over our estimates by $800,000.

1031
01:32:08,703 --> 01:32:16,846
The reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, is in my opinion that when you have year after year of estimates that are far below the actual receipts,

1032
01:32:31,971 --> 01:32:42,953
To me, it would say something about a community that the community is looking to have a surplus rather than to give actual numbers or closer to actual numbers.

1033
01:32:43,494 --> 01:32:54,276
If you look at FY, FY15, the actual receipts that were received in FY15 was $16,000,414,434.

1034
01:33:01,511 --> 01:33:07,655
What we estimated, and that's what we put in our estimation for total receipts, was $13,475,700.

1035
01:33:07,695 --> 01:33:08,516
We were almost off by $3 million.

1036
01:33:08,536 --> 01:33:09,997
And again, that should have been added to the receipts.

1037
01:33:18,583 --> 01:33:27,171
bringing up the receipts, what we anticipate to take in, and lower the tax levy, which would lower the tax for every resident in this community.

1038
01:33:27,631 --> 01:33:29,673
And some would say, well, it's not a lot of money.

1039
01:33:30,033 --> 01:33:32,475
If you look at it, it really doesn't amount to much.

1040
01:33:32,936 --> 01:33:39,721
But if you add it up over year, over year, over year, you would see that it would be a savings to the residents of this community.

1041
01:33:40,282 --> 01:33:42,123
So for the past four years,

1042
01:33:42,904 --> 01:33:53,490
and I won't go any further into it, Mr. President, our actual receipts exceeded the estimated receipts in each and every year for the past four years.

1043
01:33:54,391 --> 01:34:07,218
So I think we have to do a better job, and this is something I brought up at the Committee of the Whole meeting, when we have our estimates and look at last year's receipts and say we did X number of dollars.

1044
01:34:07,638 --> 01:34:09,359
For instance, if you look at

1045
01:34:12,599 --> 01:34:13,246
Taxize.

1046
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:14,257
RoomTax.

1047
01:34:15,673 --> 01:34:23,795
You know, we added a hotel in the community about a year and a half ago, although we decreased what we believe we're gonna be bringing in on room tax.

1048
01:34:24,535 --> 01:34:26,055
It makes no sense at all.

1049
01:34:27,376 --> 01:34:45,380
And the only sense it makes is to make sure that this community doesn't run into a deficit, but it doesn't really give, in my opinion, a strong number of estimated receipts based on year after year projections.

1050
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:47,981
And the same applies to the meals tax.

1051
01:34:48,361 --> 01:34:51,782
The same applies to rentals and other fees in this community.

1052
01:34:52,322 --> 01:35:06,227
So, again, Mr. President, I will ask in next year's budget that the number of receipts be closer to the previous year's actuals, unless they can speak up and say what the reason is.

1053
01:35:06,627 --> 01:35:09,968
If there's a legit reason, then I'd like to hear it.

1054
01:35:10,528 --> 01:35:21,437
But year after year, to be underestimating and not giving the residents of this community somewhat of a break, to me is a shame, Mr. President, and shouldn't happen.

1055
01:35:21,998 --> 01:35:32,067
I also think it's important, and we didn't bring it up this year, and I know it's mentioned every year, when we talk about the minimum residential factor, it's important because we read this off all the time.

1056
01:35:32,787 --> 01:35:40,032
single family homes, the average value of $508,000 assessment will see roughly an increase of $179.

1057
01:35:40,072 --> 01:35:40,493
That's an average.

1058
01:35:40,513 --> 01:35:41,574
So some will be more, some will be less.

1059
01:35:41,974 --> 01:35:44,055
Condos at a $384,000 assessment will see an increase of $113.

1060
01:35:44,296 --> 01:35:46,998
Some will see more, some will see a little less.

1061
01:35:54,663 --> 01:35:58,105
Two families with the average assessment at $610,000 will see a $393 increase over last year.

1062
01:35:58,185 --> 01:35:58,965
And again, that's average.

1063
01:35:58,985 --> 01:36:02,767
And three families based on a $749,000 average assessment will see a $579 increase in their property tax bill.

1064
01:36:15,733 --> 01:36:24,460
Commercial and industrial will see a decrease, which hasn't happened in a lot of years, of $305, and that is an average.

1065
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:28,262
Some will get a decrease more, and some will get a decrease less than that.

1066
01:36:28,723 --> 01:36:37,709
So I think that's important for the edification of people, Mr. President, that will see their bills go up in the upcoming tax fiscal year.

1067
01:36:38,109 --> 01:36:39,010
Thank you, Mr. President.

1068
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:40,071
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1069
01:36:40,231 --> 01:36:41,171
Councilor Knight.

1070
01:36:41,271 --> 01:36:50,435
Mr. President, I missed Councilor Marks when he first started off because I was sending some paperwork that the messenger had, but I'm assuming that was paper 17793 we were just speaking about the committee report?

1071
01:36:50,975 --> 01:36:51,876
No, we haven't done that one yet.

1072
01:36:52,016 --> 01:36:57,938
Okay, well, why don't we take the committee reports up, Mr. President, move for approval on both, and then we can have this gentleman get a sign.

1073
01:36:58,338 --> 01:36:58,818
Yes.

1074
01:36:59,058 --> 01:36:59,419
All right.

1075
01:36:59,659 --> 01:37:02,860
On the motion from the Sprenger to accept the committee report 17793.

1076
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:03,800
And 1794, Mr. President.

1077
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:04,040
And 1794.

1078
01:37:10,075 --> 01:37:11,455
Seconded by Councilor Scavelli.

1079
01:37:12,236 --> 01:37:23,278
Motion to accept the report of Committee of the Whole meeting December 6th, 2017 to review and discuss fiscal 2018 property tax allocation.

1080
01:37:23,318 --> 01:37:23,999
All those in favor?

1081
01:37:24,139 --> 01:37:24,219
Aye.

1082
01:37:24,879 --> 01:37:27,139
Motion passes.

1083
01:37:27,159 --> 01:37:35,782
1779.4, report of the Committee of the Whole, December 5th, 2017 to review and discuss the Eversource Transmission Project and grantable location.

1084
01:37:36,502 --> 01:37:37,122
On the motion by.

1085
01:37:38,777 --> 01:37:41,159
Move for approval.

1086
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:48,784
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelly.

1087
01:37:49,305 --> 01:37:58,211
All those in favor?

1088
01:37:58,311 --> 01:37:58,472
Aye.

1089
01:37:58,492 --> 01:38:00,193
We already granted them the right to location.

1090
01:38:01,254 --> 01:38:04,836
We already gave them the grant license.

1091
01:38:04,856 --> 01:38:05,957
To adopt the committee report.

1092
01:38:08,855 --> 01:38:09,915
All those in favor?

1093
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:11,416
Motion passes.

1094
01:38:11,616 --> 01:38:13,597
Mr. President, motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

1095
01:38:13,617 --> 01:38:18,679
Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular business, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1096
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:22,961
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1097
01:38:23,121 --> 01:38:30,844
17796, petition for sign and denial reversal by Jason Perillo for back bay sign for Johnson Supply, 91 Hicks Avenue, Medford.

1098
01:38:30,944 --> 01:38:37,827
OCD application 2017-21B exceeds allowable size and secondary sign.

1099
01:38:38,607 --> 01:38:43,130
Councilor, Vice President Mox, is the sign subcommittee chairman.

1100
01:38:44,391 --> 01:38:45,432
Thank you, Mr. President.

1101
01:38:45,492 --> 01:38:47,453
We have the petitioner.

1102
01:38:47,473 --> 01:38:49,634
Are you from the sign company?

1103
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:49,895
Yes.

1104
01:38:50,495 --> 01:38:52,937
We have a gentleman from the sign company here.

1105
01:38:53,537 --> 01:38:56,559
If he can just give a brief presentation, Mr. President.

1106
01:38:56,959 --> 01:38:57,500
Absolutely.

1107
01:38:58,801 --> 01:39:00,882
I'm Jason Perillo with Back Bay Sign.

1108
01:39:00,902 --> 01:39:03,283
I'll serve as representing Johnson Supply this evening.

1109
01:39:04,184 --> 01:39:07,627
This property is a new tenant, this property at 91 Hicks Ave.

1110
01:39:07,707 --> 01:39:18,295
It's a situation where the front of the property on Hicks Ave is shorter than the side elevation, which is on Mystic Ave, which isn't technically a street, but it functions much like a street.

1111
01:39:18,315 --> 01:39:25,400
Pretty much all the business activity of this business is gonna be on that secondary elevation, the parking, the loading dock, the customer entrance.

1112
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:29,643
So that's why we proposed the larger sign to go on that secondary elevation.

1113
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:30,344
Thank you.

1114
01:39:35,502 --> 01:39:36,022
Counselor Knight.

1115
01:39:37,563 --> 01:39:39,623
Mr. President, I had an opportunity to speak with the gentleman.

1116
01:39:39,643 --> 01:39:41,764
I've taken a look at the sign, and I'm very familiar with the site.

1117
01:39:41,784 --> 01:39:47,506
I feel as though it's not going to have much impact on the quality of life or beauty of the neighborhood, and it certainly will help out the business owner.

1118
01:39:47,546 --> 01:39:49,627
So with that being said, I'd move for approval on the paper.

1119
01:39:50,787 --> 01:39:57,569
Mr. President.

1120
01:39:57,589 --> 01:39:59,690
Mr. President of the box.

1121
01:40:01,145 --> 01:40:04,686
It's important to note that this sign is not internally illuminated.

1122
01:40:04,706 --> 01:40:05,186
That's correct.

1123
01:40:06,526 --> 01:40:12,428
And it does point to where the location is, which is to the rear of the building, correct?

1124
01:40:12,468 --> 01:40:12,728
Exactly.

1125
01:40:12,908 --> 01:40:13,448
The access.

1126
01:40:14,388 --> 01:40:21,430
I too, Mr. President, have no problem with this sign and would move approval, Mr. President.

1127
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:24,991
On the motion by Vice President Mox for approval, seconded by?

1128
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:28,632
Seconded by Council Member Kern.

1129
01:40:28,672 --> 01:40:29,272
All those in favor?

1130
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:31,619
Motion passes, thank you very much.

1131
01:40:31,639 --> 01:40:34,101
Thank you very much, thank you.

1132
01:40:34,622 --> 01:40:37,144
Motion by Councilor Knight to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1133
01:40:37,684 --> 01:40:39,185
Seconded by Councilor Long-Teran.

1134
01:40:39,226 --> 01:40:39,806
All those in favor?

1135
01:40:41,147 --> 01:40:42,008
Motion passes.

1136
01:40:43,409 --> 01:40:44,470
I'm sorry?

1137
01:40:48,233 --> 01:40:51,376
Okay.

1138
01:40:51,416 --> 01:40:53,478
Let him speak.

1139
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:56,646
Name and address of the record, please.

1140
01:40:57,247 --> 01:40:58,468
My name is Matthew Page Lieberman.

1141
01:40:58,508 --> 01:41:00,731
I live at 15 Canal Street, apartment 15.

1142
01:41:02,493 --> 01:41:05,377
I just want to apologize for not getting in on the docket in time.

1143
01:41:06,318 --> 01:41:10,263
But I'm here about some comments that were voiced last week at the school committee.

1144
01:41:11,224 --> 01:41:13,086
I know that this is- Can I make a-

1145
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:23,365
All the people that are mentioned are not here to defend themselves or make a comment, so it's something that we cannot discuss without all parties being present.

1146
01:41:23,685 --> 01:41:25,927
I'm not prosecuting anybody.

1147
01:41:26,047 --> 01:41:27,487
I'm not prosecuting anybody.

1148
01:41:27,507 --> 01:41:32,230
We won't discuss this without everybody being here, and this should be discussed in executive session.

1149
01:41:34,051 --> 01:41:34,192
OK.

1150
01:41:34,212 --> 01:41:38,574
Counselor Knight.

1151
01:41:38,934 --> 01:41:41,936
So executive session excludes the residents, is that correct?

1152
01:41:41,956 --> 01:41:43,057
That's correct.

1153
01:41:43,077 --> 01:41:44,378
There's people here that are not

1154
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:48,281
His name's mentioned here, but people aren't hearing the audience tonight.

1155
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:50,501
Mr. President, if I may?

1156
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:59,604
The Attorney General put out a guideline, and the guideline was relative to the open meeting law and the requirements thereof and the top ten reasons for why a public body can go into executive session.

1157
01:42:00,084 --> 01:42:04,565
Rule number one is to discuss the reputation of character rather than the professional competence of any individual.

1158
01:42:05,965 --> 01:42:08,726
Are you going to name the names?

1159
01:42:10,852 --> 01:42:12,893
I put the names down there for public record.

1160
01:42:12,913 --> 01:42:20,860
He has a paper here that I don't think that's something that we should be discussing and I'm gonna move the paper out of order.

1161
01:42:23,722 --> 01:42:29,227
Thank you.

1162
01:42:31,809 --> 01:42:34,111
The people on here to defend themselves that are on this paper.

1163
01:42:35,476 --> 01:42:40,558
Should we wish to go into executive to discuss the matter, we need to provide the parties that are subject to the discussion with 48 hours notice.

1164
01:42:40,578 --> 01:42:41,659
Point of information, Mr. President?

1165
01:42:41,699 --> 01:42:47,941
Before me here, I have the open meeting guide from the Attorney General's office.

1166
01:43:02,525 --> 01:43:14,773
The individual to be discussed in executive session shall be notified in writing by the public body at least 40 hours prior to the proposed executive session, provided, however, the notification may be waived upon written agreement of the parties.

1167
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:18,336
I believe that the handout that came across here does indicate that.

1168
01:43:19,937 --> 01:43:21,197
I might not have read the handout.

1169
01:43:22,616 --> 01:43:24,657
I just read the materials that he passed out when he came out.

1170
01:43:25,137 --> 01:43:26,837
I guess I do, because I read the papers that he gave us.

1171
01:43:26,857 --> 01:43:28,198
You got the paper that you were given.

1172
01:43:28,218 --> 01:43:32,459
Are we speaking about the paper he gave us, or are you speaking in general about politics?

1173
01:43:32,619 --> 01:43:36,660
I was just providing something that's part of the public record with that paper.

1174
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:40,401
We have it, and it's for the council to do what they want with it.

1175
01:43:41,904 --> 01:43:47,907
That the council can do whatever everybody wants, but there are some important things to understand about how this reflects upon the community.

1176
01:43:48,328 --> 01:43:54,991
Okay, but again, there's people here whose reputations may be jeopardized here.

1177
01:44:00,914 --> 01:44:02,476
Look, I don't want to violate the law.

1178
01:44:02,496 --> 01:44:05,618
If Adam's saying that this is a violation of open records.

1179
01:44:05,678 --> 01:44:07,379
If you're going to name people's names.

1180
01:44:07,399 --> 01:44:08,500
No, I have no interest in doing that.

1181
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:09,640
I have no interest in naming names.

1182
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:12,202
But there are some serious dynamics about what happened that need to be addressed.

1183
01:44:12,222 --> 01:44:13,903
Point of information to Councilor Scott Powell.

1184
01:44:13,923 --> 01:44:15,124
I don't disagree if it's done right.

1185
01:44:27,313 --> 01:44:34,882
You mentioned that you wanted his public record, what you gave us, and that's what I find is the issue.

1186
01:44:34,922 --> 01:44:35,623
That's all.

1187
01:44:35,824 --> 01:44:39,007
I'm only saying that I'm referring to something that's already in the public record.

1188
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:41,971
Okay, I haven't seen it, so.

1189
01:44:42,151 --> 01:44:44,955
I haven't seen the public record, so I can't comment on it either.

1190
01:44:45,395 --> 01:44:45,696
Thank you.

1191
01:44:47,138 --> 01:44:55,970
Everybody needs to see a public record before people can discuss something that's already in the public record What is on public record the conversation that happened last week at the school committee?

1192
01:44:56,471 --> 01:44:58,754
That's my school.

1193
01:45:00,076 --> 01:45:02,979
I It's not on the public record if it happens with the school committee

1194
01:45:04,507 --> 01:45:05,408
We have no record of that.

1195
01:45:06,108 --> 01:45:08,370
I have not received any record of it.

1196
01:45:08,931 --> 01:45:10,052
I put them all online.

1197
01:45:10,292 --> 01:45:12,053
Everybody knows I've been doing it for three years.

1198
01:45:12,113 --> 01:45:15,756
Online is not for us, a public record for us.

1199
01:45:16,177 --> 01:45:22,062
We've never received anything in our... Okay, so what will it take to move this forward?

1200
01:45:22,082 --> 01:45:24,624
Do I have to send emails to everybody with the links to the videos I put online?

1201
01:45:24,644 --> 01:45:25,124
No, it's public.

1202
01:45:25,665 --> 01:45:27,326
Again, he needs something else.

1203
01:45:27,366 --> 01:45:30,489
Or do I have to get somebody to stamp it that it's a public record?

1204
01:45:30,549 --> 01:45:31,950
You submit it to the clerk.

1205
01:45:33,814 --> 01:45:37,897
And this week I just have to get you to stamp it or something like this?

1206
01:45:38,178 --> 01:45:39,018
It has to be received.

1207
01:45:39,038 --> 01:45:53,109
My only suggestion is that this is subject only to the school committee that your petition should be to the school committee.

1208
01:45:53,129 --> 01:45:53,830
Yeah, not to us.

1209
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:55,211
And the school committee themselves.

1210
01:45:55,251 --> 01:45:56,572
They can make a decision to us.

1211
01:45:59,452 --> 01:46:01,753
Are you saying the school committee would make it a public record?

1212
01:46:02,233 --> 01:46:03,273
They can make it a public record.

1213
01:46:03,353 --> 01:46:05,594
And that would be up to their discretion?

1214
01:46:05,734 --> 01:46:10,695
That's up to their discretion.

1215
01:46:10,755 --> 01:46:13,576
Can I say something without mentioning any of those people?

1216
01:46:15,457 --> 01:46:16,517
If you're not mentioning any names.

1217
01:46:16,637 --> 01:46:18,878
I have no intention of mentioning any of those people.

1218
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:23,609
I will say, though, that there are very many people who are upset about what happened.

1219
01:46:24,109 --> 01:46:31,130
And I know that there are things that people are trying to take to address some of these dynamics in our community.

1220
01:46:31,890 --> 01:46:44,632
I would just ask that anybody on this body, when anybody comes forward and asks for any kind of support, that people really honor it, that people try to figure out, how can we work to make sure that things that happened previously don't happen in any of our bodies?

1221
01:46:47,213 --> 01:46:47,933
Thank you for your opinion.

1222
01:46:52,817 --> 01:46:55,658
Motion to take hands from the clerk.

1223
01:46:56,919 --> 01:47:08,003
Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the pavement at the entrance to 100 High Street Condos parking lot located on Route 16 be repaired in the interest of public safety.

1224
01:47:09,311 --> 01:47:10,152
Vice President Mox.

1225
01:47:10,713 --> 01:47:11,654
Thank you, Mr. President.

1226
01:47:11,694 --> 01:47:19,664
This particular road, which is the entrance to the 100 High Street condos, their parking lot, is in deplorable condition.

1227
01:47:20,045 --> 01:47:26,714
And I would ask that this paper be sent to the State Highway Department for repair of that roadway, Mr. President.

1228
01:47:27,354 --> 01:47:30,860
On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Council Member Kern.

1229
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:31,541
All those in favor?

1230
01:47:32,342 --> 01:47:33,123
Motion passes.

1231
01:47:33,944 --> 01:47:40,233
After by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the two catch basins located at 16 Cook Circle be discussed.

1232
01:47:40,594 --> 01:47:41,355
Vice President Mox.

1233
01:47:42,236 --> 01:47:43,237
Thank you, Mr. President.

1234
01:47:43,757 --> 01:47:54,862
It's my understanding that on Cook Circle, they installed two catch basins over the last several years to alleviate some of the water concerns that they have up on the hill.

1235
01:47:55,742 --> 01:48:04,826
And what's happening right now is these catch basins are getting clogged with leaves, and the rain runoff is going behind the homes on

1236
01:48:06,787 --> 01:48:11,550
Cook Circle leading down to the backyards on homes that are on Lawrence Road.

1237
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:19,515
And it's eroding the hill that separates the homes on both streets and creating a concern.

1238
01:48:19,555 --> 01:48:31,842
So I would ask that DPW take a look at ways that they can prevent the leaves from clogging up these two particular catch basins in front of 16 Cook Circle.

1239
01:48:32,382 --> 01:48:33,102
Thank you, Mr. President.

1240
01:48:33,543 --> 01:48:35,404
On the motion by Vice President Mox.

1241
01:48:36,304 --> 01:48:37,765
Seconded by Councilor DelaRosa.

1242
01:48:37,845 --> 01:48:38,605
All those in favor?

1243
01:48:40,706 --> 01:48:41,726
Aye, motion passes.

1244
01:48:42,526 --> 01:48:46,647
Records of the meeting of December 5th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Knight.

1245
01:48:46,707 --> 01:48:48,368
Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

1246
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:56,210
Mr. President, before we end the meeting.

1247
01:48:56,711 --> 01:48:57,411
Vice President Mox.

1248
01:48:58,251 --> 01:48:59,232
Thank you, Mr. President.

1249
01:48:59,813 --> 01:49:11,041
I just want to bring up, I had the opportunity with some of my colleagues this past Saturday to attend the grand opening of our first ever dog park in this community.

1250
01:49:11,061 --> 01:49:12,322
I know you were there, Mr. President.

1251
01:49:12,662 --> 01:49:16,605
Councilor Lungo Kern, Councilor Falco were present at the time.

1252
01:49:17,926 --> 01:49:18,967
It was a great event.

1253
01:49:19,407 --> 01:49:23,971
There were dozens of dogs, both for the small and large dog park.

1254
01:49:24,491 --> 01:49:38,921
I want to personally thank, again, Mr. President, a group of residents that got together with a particular need in mind, and that was to create an area where dogs could socialize and exercise some three years ago.

1255
01:49:39,661 --> 01:49:43,564
And this particular group of residents found a $250,000 Stanton Foundation grant.

1256
01:49:43,604 --> 01:49:45,686
They did the research and found a dog park

1257
01:49:52,590 --> 01:49:57,493
architect who was instrumental in doing other parks around this particular area.

1258
01:49:58,093 --> 01:50:12,622
The members of the PAWS Committee, Patty Flynn, Jim Silva, Gary DiStefano, Diane Gittner, John Sardone, were all instrumental in moving this very important and well-needed dog park in this community.

1259
01:50:13,142 --> 01:50:14,443
I want to thank Mayor McGlynn,

1260
01:50:14,863 --> 01:50:20,165
who originally was the person that this dark power committee approached.

1261
01:50:20,845 --> 01:50:27,928
The mayor saw fit to do a survey citywide, and that's how we came up with the location behind the McGlynn School.

1262
01:50:28,308 --> 01:50:32,850
So I want to thank Mayor McGlynn for his foresight and vision on this.

1263
01:50:33,631 --> 01:50:44,055
And I hope, Mr. President, for future needs in this community that citizen-driven participation will always be welcomed.

1264
01:50:44,935 --> 01:50:53,941
in this community, and I think this is a great example of what can happen when there's a need in the community and a number of citizens that need to address that.

1265
01:50:54,341 --> 01:51:04,247
And you, Mr. Vice President, should be championed for taking the lead in this way back a couple years ago, and we at the City Council thank you for all your hard work that you did on this.

1266
01:51:04,267 --> 01:51:06,069
Thank you.

1267
01:51:06,089 --> 01:51:06,969
Seconded by Councilor.

1268
01:51:07,349 --> 01:51:10,992
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso to adjourn.

1269
01:51:12,145 --> 01:51:13,706
Although, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1270
01:51:13,726 --> 01:51:17,828
May I comment on Councilor Marks' brilliant achievement?

1271
01:51:18,888 --> 01:51:19,268
Thank you.

1272
01:51:20,009 --> 01:51:22,290
Councilor Marks, congratulations, you came through.

1273
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:24,111
I'm glad the dogs got their due.

1274
01:51:24,431 --> 01:51:30,034
I hope someday the owner-occupiers get their $1,200 a year in real estate tax savings also.

1275
01:51:30,414 --> 01:51:36,136
Especially when the seniors can maybe afford to stay and live in the houses in West Medford or South Medford.

1276
01:51:36,377 --> 01:51:37,197
Thank you for listening.

1277
01:51:37,917 --> 01:51:38,918
On the motion to adjourn.

1278
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:40,773
All those in favor?

1279
01:51:41,677 --> 01:51:43,022
Motion passes, meeting adjourned.
