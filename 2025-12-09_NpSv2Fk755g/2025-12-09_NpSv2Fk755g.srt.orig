1
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:22,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Zach, can you hear me?

2
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:24,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can hear you.

3
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:25,678
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, buddy.

4
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:28,859
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right.

5
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:34,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have, obviously, you know, I have some questions as a solar guy.

6
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that it shouldn't be a big deal though.

7
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:41,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

8
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

9
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda's here.

10
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:44,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda's got the info for us.

11
00:05:44,783 --> 00:05:45,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

12
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:45,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Brenda.

13
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:47,920
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

14
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to have an opportunity to talk about it before the regular meeting.

15
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:57,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, no, I think it's important, especially the climate that's going on right now with solar.

16
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

17
00:06:00,723 --> 00:06:00,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

18
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:04,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll get people to join us and then we'll get started.

19
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:05,524
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

20
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Brenda.

21
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:07,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Emily.

22
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:07,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Matt.

23
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:11,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

24
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:14,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Rich too.

25
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:16,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everyone.

26
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,362
[SPEAKER_02]: and whoever is manning the booth, Kevin or Jim, are shamed.

27
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:08,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Rich, could you make Brenda a co-host?

28
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:13,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

29
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:13,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

30
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:21,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

31
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:22,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I can unmute myself now.

32
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, everyone.

33
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're just waiting for Kit.

34
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:32,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she's in the waiting room.

35
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:33,435
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

36
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:35,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Anna's not able to make it tonight.

37
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:58,371
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, welcome everyone.

38
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:03,115
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Medford City Council, Committee of the Whole, December 9th, 2025.

39
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:06,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called to order.

40
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:08,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

41

00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:55,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, can you hear me?

57
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:56,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

58
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:58,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, present.

59
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:07,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Seng.

60
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:08,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

61
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:10,624
[SPEAKER_02]: And President Deans.

62
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:11,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

63
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:13,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Six present, one absent.

64
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:14,508
[SPEAKER_02]: The meeting is called to order.

65
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:19,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Action and discussion items 25-186 submitted by Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

66
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:22,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Authorization of contract period in excess of three years.

67
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:26,458
[SPEAKER_02]: McGlynn School solar panel, 20-year contract with Select Energy.

68
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:34,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear President Behrs and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approves the following 20-year contracts with Select Energy.

69
00:10:34,905 --> 00:10:41,631
[SPEAKER_02]: As the Council is aware, Mass General Law Chapter 30B, Section 12 requires City Council approval for a contract that exceeds three years.

70
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:48,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreement authorizes the city to enter into a 20-year lease agreement to allow for installation of solar photovoltaic

71
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:55,761
[SPEAKER_02]: PV on the McGlynn School roof, as well as a power purchase agreement to purchase electricity produced by said installation.

72
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:01,463
[SPEAKER_02]: This type of financial agreement was previously used on the Department of Public Works solar installation.

73
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,903
[SPEAKER_02]: It avoids any upfront capital costs to the city.

74
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:11,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, the installer owns the solar panels and the city purchases the electricity

75
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:14,688
[SPEAKER_02]: produced by them.

76
00:11:14,728 --> 00:11:18,109
[SPEAKER_02]: The contract is for 20 years, the anticipated useful lifespan of the solar panels.

77
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:27,752
[SPEAKER_02]: It stretches the cost of the panels over a length of time that reduces the per kilowatt hour cost of energy from the current supply cost of 0.1311 kilowatt hours to 0.0467 kilowatt hours.

78
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lungo Kern-Mayer.

79
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:47,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And we scheduled this committee of the whole so that we could have a discussion on the request for a contract allowing for a contract period greater than three years, allowing the city and the mayor to enter into that.

80
00:11:47,735 --> 00:12:00,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to make sure that we heard from Brenda from our planning development sustainability office and get any questions answered because there's some timeliness required here

81
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:07,067
[SPEAKER_02]: the changes in the federal landscape around renewable energy.

82
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:13,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will recognize Brenda Pike to present on this, and then we'll go to councilors for questions.

83
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:14,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

84
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:17,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

85
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:22,130
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will just share a slide with some information about this.

86
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:30,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And first off, I just wanted to say I appreciate you holding this meeting considering the timeline for this contract.

87
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:40,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we teased this topic in the past when we were talking about the HVAC project at Andrews and McGlynn, but now we're back with an actual proposal.

88
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:55,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is for the power purchase agreement for a 360 kilowatt system that would generate about 48% of the McGlynn's current electric usage at a flat rate of about four and a half cents per kilowatt hour for 20 years.

89
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:57,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's projected to save us about 64,000 in year one.

90
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:10,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And the installation would start in the fall of 2026, after the HVAC replacement and the roof refurbishment are done.

91
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:16,085
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do need to sign the contract by the end of this year to meet federal tax credit requirements.

92
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:24,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And we wouldn't be applying for those tax credits ourselves, but the installer would be and the rate that we get is based on them passing part of that on to us.

93
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:30,730
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the project weren't eligible for tax credits, the rate would be almost double what we show here.

94
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:36,724
[SPEAKER_07]: We discussed this with the school committee last week and got their approval to move forward.

95
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:43,027
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the quick summary of this, but if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

96
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:45,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

97
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:49,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I will go to Councillor Scarpelli and then anyone else who has questions.

98
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Scarpelli.

99
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councillor Baez.

100
00:13:53,131 --> 00:14:01,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I will disclose that I do own a solar company and it has no direct impact with this negotiation, but I just wanted to disclose that.

101
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:08,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, for the record, Mr. President, so I, I do, I do see Brendan.

102
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:11,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for taking taking the time.

103
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:12,887
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did have some questions.

104
00:14:12,947 --> 00:14:22,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I, um, if you can, can you share the reason why, you know, I know that that upfront costs really doesn't make that really doesn't make a difference if.

105
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:26,217
[SPEAKER_04]: we have either PPA or ownership.

106
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:36,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the benefit I know with ownership after the 10 years, the benefit is very, very high for us and more beneficial.

107
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:44,081
[SPEAKER_04]: But why was it, why would you, give us an example why we took PPA, a lease over the ownership if you can.

108
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:54,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I mean, I agree that the long term financial benefits would be higher if we own the system, but it would cost over $900,000 upfront.

109
00:14:55,776 --> 00:15:02,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it would be a five year payback before we saw any savings.

110
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:11,310
[SPEAKER_07]: And then one other benefit specific to the PPA model is that we are responsible for the maintenance of it, the installer would be.

111
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:13,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so with the...

112
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:28,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we done a cost analysis to show what the five-year and what the benefits are for the first through the leasing option and the benefit with ownership over those years?

113
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we done a detailed analysis to show?

114
00:15:32,394 --> 00:15:42,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it would be interesting to see how much money we could save if we put in what it would take to purchase up front and then move forward to ownership.

115
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I love the fact that we're going solar.

116
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:49,082
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so important.

117
00:15:49,162 --> 00:16:09,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, I'm going to bring this up again, Brenda, and you could tell Alicia, because I made a resolution years ago to look at the Dillboy Stadium parking lot and the Hormel Stadium parking lot to turn that into a solar parking lot to assist with funding the hockey rink and the stadium.

118
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:13,974
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that'd be something I'd like to look into later, but that's neither here nor there.

119
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:23,059
[SPEAKER_04]: With this situation, we're looking at 731 panels, and I know the breakdown projected $64,000 in savings.

120
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:38,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, you know, just for, I wouldn't hold it up, but I'd just like to know what the analysis would show between leasing and owning and where that ROI would be.

121
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't have that in front of me right now, but I can follow up with you.

122
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:44,812
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

123
00:16:45,032 --> 00:16:45,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

124
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can.

125
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:46,972
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.

126
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:47,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

127
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:47,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

128
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:48,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

129
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:54,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the big difference here was is the tax credits.

130
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:54,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

131
00:16:54,675 --> 00:16:58,056
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we were looking at, you know, potentially delaying

132
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:07,809
[SPEAKER_07]: this in order to purchase it or to move forward with the PPA with the tax credits.

133
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:13,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's one of the major reasons why we chose to move forward with this PPA right now.

134
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:26,853
[SPEAKER_04]: The tax credit though, the tax credit is still in effect for commercial properties or commercial deals through 2027, so it wouldn't affect us negatively until after 2027, correct?

135
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:42,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if we sign the contract by the end of this year, the installation can be before the end of 2027, but we would need to sign the contract.

136
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:56,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, so I know the big beautiful bill that's killing so many initiatives in that country is putting us in a terrible situation when you're looking at benefits for especially solar and wind.

137
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,671
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's sad.

138
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:01,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that answers that.

139
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:10,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the, the, the other piece that's really pressing is, um, as we move forward with the new roof.

140
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:23,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and we start then looking into liability of, um, who then takes the liability of any leaking issues with.

141
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:38,621
[SPEAKER_04]: when it comes to longevity of the roof and asking if the roof, do we know if it's going to be ballast mounted or are they going to be penetrating through the roof?

142
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:50,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And then who would then take the responsibility or do we lose the warranty with the roofing company once we then jeopardize the seals with

143
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,911
[SPEAKER_04]: With solar, because I know it's two different companies, correct?

144
00:18:55,252 --> 00:19:13,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes, and they are discussing with the roofing company the warranty situation there in the same way that the HVAC project had to coordinate with the roofing company in order to make sure that they didn't void any warranty that we had on the roof there.

145
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll get clear definition who will then have ownership.

146
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:26,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that when you lease, you have, at least in the residential side, there's a 10-year penetration warranty for any leakage.

147
00:19:26,953 --> 00:19:32,759
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're talking about a commercial flat roof, and we're looking at issues that we've had in the past,

148
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:48,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking down the line where we're walking away from this and this council might be gone long gone in 10 and 15 years, but then we'll see the negative effects of an aging roof with penetration from.

149
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:51,614
[SPEAKER_04]: from solar install.

150
00:19:51,634 --> 00:20:03,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that it's important that we get some of those answers, Brenda, taken care of because when it comes down to it, I would hate to hear at the council, sometimes our council likes to blame councils in the past.

151
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:10,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd hate to be that council that they talk about 10 years from now saying it's all their fault because they didn't ask the right question.

152
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:13,490
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can get some guidance and some

153
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:26,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Some, um, you know, something in writing so we know what what has been the decision who takes that that that that warranty and that risk.

154
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:26,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

155
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:36,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, get KP law has been negotiating the contract with select on our behalf and.

156
00:20:36,697 --> 00:20:43,720
[SPEAKER_07]: That has been one of their main considerations is where, who has liability for what portions of it, right?

157
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:53,524
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's something that is directly as a result of the solar panels, then that would be, the liability would be with Select.

158
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:55,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

159
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:55,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

160
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:09,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate all the hard work, but again, I think there are some questions for me just to say, to bring it forward tonight, that if we need a vote tonight, I just think it's without knowing those particulars.

161
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,595
[SPEAKER_04]: The financial aspects, understanding the lease over the own ownership, I understand that.

162
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:21,921
[SPEAKER_04]: The other avenue that the question that was asked was, did we look at possibly carrying our own battery?

163
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:29,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we can store the energy and then then sell it back with net meter into the, the utilities.

164
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:31,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that was ever entertained by any chance?

165
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:37,510
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't look at it for this project, but we did for the Andrew solar project.

166
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,572
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was something that wasn't.

167
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:53,754
[SPEAKER_07]: financially viable without a grant for the battery, which is something the Department of Energy Resources has come out now with a grant for batteries in particular.

168
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:57,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that we could do in the future, but it didn't line up with the timelines for this.

169
00:21:59,844 --> 00:22:08,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there are some restrictions when it comes to how far the services to the plant that it would, that answers that.

170
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate you looking into that.

171
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:27,898
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, like I said, understanding that maintenance question, that warranty question, I think that's so important before we move on to anything that I would hate to be the council that said, we would like to move forward with this without understanding totally what that

172
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,120
[SPEAKER_04]: That impact would be on the city down the line.

173
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:41,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if something does happen with that roof, because we've always from a lot of us that we're here for a while, understand the negative impact that we saw at the high school.

174
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:42,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And we saw see the.

175
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:47,827
[SPEAKER_04]: The shoddy work of past roofing contracts that were.

176
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:52,470
[SPEAKER_04]: were pushed through at the Meffitt High School site.

177
00:22:52,510 --> 00:23:00,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but again, it's a lot of questions and I appreciate the answers, Brendan, appreciate the hard work and I yield to my fellow colleagues.

178
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:01,255
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

179
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:04,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

180
00:23:04,037 --> 00:23:05,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciated those questions.

181
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:08,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Councilor Lazaro and then Councilor Lemming.

182
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lazaro.

183
00:23:15,285 --> 00:23:15,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily, you're on mute.

184
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,002
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very good at Zoom.

185
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:35,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly for some clarification, this is the final negotiated deal and there won't be further negotiations on this?

186
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:37,254
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the proposal and this is it?

187
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:47,923
[SPEAKER_07]: The contract is still being negotiated at the moment, but we wanted to come to you now because with the timing of this, it was

188
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:55,470
[SPEAKER_07]: it would have made it more difficult to wait until after the contract is negotiated.

189
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:04,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I do not feel comfortable moving forward with something without a final contract with final numbers.

190
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:17,457
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some tricky stuff with contracts that we approved a longer term, or we didn't, a prior city council approved a longer term contract and then

191
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we're never a part of the negotiating.

192
00:24:23,476 --> 00:24:39,228
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess there isn't a guarantee that this will be exactly what the numbers will be, what the kilowatts per year, how many years it'll be, what the projected savings will be.

193
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:41,249
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, well, the projected savings is just an estimate.

194
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:41,930
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.

195
00:24:43,451 --> 00:24:48,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm confused about how we can approve something if we don't know what the final numbers are.

196
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:54,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I will note that technically we don't approve the contract.

197
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:59,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We are authorizing the city to enter into a contract period greater than three years.

198
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,972
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing we're negotiating then.

199
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:04,453
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only saying you can have it for more than three years.

200
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:09,796
[SPEAKER_02]: We can ask a lot of questions, but yeah, we never approve a contract.

201
00:25:09,816 --> 00:25:13,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We just say the period can be longer than three years.

202
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:17,794
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess then what is the point of showing us all this information?

203
00:25:19,695 --> 00:25:21,656
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, can you answer that?

204
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:26,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Me or Brenda?

205
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:30,320
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm curious.

206
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,241
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's great to have this presentation.

207
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:35,762
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to do it in a public meeting.

208
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that we're doing this project.

209
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we're taking advantage of the tax break.

210
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:50,181
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have the capacity to approve or not any of the things that are being negotiated.

211
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:53,942
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, sure, we can do it for more than three years.

212
00:25:55,163 --> 00:25:57,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll recognize Brenda.

213
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:03,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I mean, it's possible that these numbers may change slightly with the final contract.

214
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:10,749
[SPEAKER_07]: But it I wouldn't anticipate it changing very much.

215
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:22,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and a lot of the contract negotiations, well, all of the contract negotiations that are going back and forth right now, um, are red lines to, to things like the liability conversation.

216
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:28,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so that's, um, that's where that is right now.

217
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

218
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

219
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:37,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I guess what I'd like to be really clear about is that what we as a city council are approving here.

220
00:26:37,963 --> 00:27:00,950
[SPEAKER_00]: is to authorize the mayor's administration to have a contract with a business that will supply the solar panels that is longer than three years, which is required by state law that we approve the mayor's office to negotiate a contract that is longer than a three-year contract.

221
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:06,192
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing that we are approving, just to put that in the public record.

222
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

223
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you, Councillor Lazzaro.

224
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:14,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Lemming.

225
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:29,399
[SPEAKER_03]: How long would it take you, Brenda, to get the answers to the questions that Councillor Scarpelli asked?

226
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:45,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in knowing the answers to some of the points that he brought up and the costs and benefits and downsides of owning the whole solar panel apparatus versus

227
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:55,036
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, renting, renting it out and getting the federal tax credits before December 31st.

228
00:27:55,637 --> 00:28:15,653
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd like to know off the top of your head what information you think you can get us about those benefits and about who's liable for the roofs and so on before this goes to a regular meeting.

229
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:21,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I mean, I would expect that the final.

230
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:27,990
[SPEAKER_07]: The contract would be finalized by next week, considering the timelines for this.

231
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So especially the.

232
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:43,954
[SPEAKER_07]: The liability portion of that that is, like I said, still going back and forth with red lines right now before I could get you a final answer on exact language around that.

233
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:46,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I would want that contract to be finalized.

234
00:28:50,307 --> 00:28:50,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

235
00:28:50,547 --> 00:29:15,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Bigger picture, I'd just like to know if the city in the long term would benefit more by doing this and taking advantage of the federal tax credit requirements in the window that we still can, or if it would be better to make a plan to actually put up the upfront costs ourselves and hold off on this.

236
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:19,808
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the sort of the essence of the question there.

237
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:31,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I would just point out that the tax credits are about 30 percent of the total cost.

238
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:38,763
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I can definitely, I can get you those numbers next week.

239
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:44,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

240
00:29:46,641 --> 00:29:47,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

241
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:48,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

242
00:29:49,463 --> 00:30:04,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for clarity, I know that the federal tax credit will expire on December 31st for residential, but to commercial-based properties, we still have one year until December 31st of 2027.

243
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:05,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct, Brenda?

244
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:22,542
[SPEAKER_07]: We, in order, we have to safe harbor this by the end of this year, by signing a contract by the end of this year, in order to, yes, we can install them by the end of 2027.

245
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:28,189
[SPEAKER_07]: But we need to have a contract signed by the end of this year to safe harbor that tax credit.

246
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:29,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

247
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:43,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So that the the the company that will be taking advantage of this tax credit will be the leasing company because that's who then then that's who takes the the benefit of the tax credit.

248
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:53,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they're getting the that's why they can negotiate with us at a lower rate because, you know, it's give and take.

249
00:30:54,712 --> 00:30:58,904
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like again, that's why when you look at ownership and taking advantage of that 30%.

250
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:05,149
[SPEAKER_04]: and then look at the ROI to see where and when that falls in.

251
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:16,796
[SPEAKER_04]: We might not have the capital needs to be done at the beginning, but that would be just the monthly payment.

252
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:20,758
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the cost occurred to this.

253
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:23,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't be anything out of pocket, correct?

254
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:25,581
[SPEAKER_04]: If ownership.

255
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,812
[SPEAKER_07]: we would need to pay for that up front.

256
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:36,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, for the power purchase agreement, there is nothing out of pocket up front.

257
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:38,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

258
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:53,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I, my confusion, my, my, my question is making sure that looking at the option and what that would look like, the cost upfront, and then the benefit, what it would look like after it was paid off.

259
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:56,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize for that, but thank you.

260
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:03,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

261
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:06,730
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had some good questions.

262
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:13,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda, do you think you'll be able to bring some of those answers to us next week when we discuss this?

263
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:16,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Our last regular meeting is next Tuesday, and I know we have this deadline coming up.

264
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:21,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the reasons that we scheduled this committee of the whole.

265
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:24,021
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like we got some good questions out the door.

266
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:32,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like you have other questions you need and some answers that you can bring next week?

267
00:32:33,663 --> 00:32:34,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, yep.

268
00:32:34,804 --> 00:32:42,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there are any other questions that people have that you think of after this, let me know and I can be prepared to answer those next week.

269
00:32:43,871 --> 00:32:44,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

270
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Brenda.

271
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:47,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Brenda.

272
00:32:48,395 --> 00:32:50,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions from members of the Council?

273
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:58,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't see any members of the public here.

274
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Chris Stevens from God I know Medford is here.

275
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:07,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris if you have any questions or if any members of the public would like to speak you can raise your hand on zoom.

276
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:20,320
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, seeing none, what we would need here is a motion to refer this to the regular meeting and adjourn.

277
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion?

278
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:21,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved.
