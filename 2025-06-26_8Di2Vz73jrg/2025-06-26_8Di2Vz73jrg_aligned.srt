00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,864
This hearing of the Metro Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

2
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:11,491
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access

3
00:00:12,507 --> 00:00:15,829
access the proceedings as provided for in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023.

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:26,535
A reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the CF Medford's website.

5
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:34,219
If, despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide real-time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible.

6
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:39,962
A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting, tonight all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

00:00:55,842 --> 00:01:01,267
You can click on city board filings, and Danielle will provide the link in the chat for if there's anyone on the public.

9
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:03,468
I'm going to do a roll call attendance.

10
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,290
Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

11
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:06,651
Present.

12
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:08,552
Peter Cowes?

13
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:10,274
Peter's not in.

14
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,015
Ari Fishman?

15
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,199
Present.

16
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,341
Pam Mariansky.

17
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,181
Present.

18
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:20,764
Sally Akiki.

19
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:23,886
Present.

20
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:26,247
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

21
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:27,988
Okay.

22
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,970
And Danielle, you can introduce any staff on the call.

23
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:39,395
Myself, Danielle Evans, senior planner and Alicia Hunt, the director of the office of planning, development and sustainability.

24
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:42,137
Okay.

25
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:47,705
And so first meet an agenda, Daniel, can you remind me while I am still fumbling?

26
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:59,854
Yeah, I'm trying to, I'm going to email you this prep doc if you, for some reason, if you can't see it, there might be syncing issues.

27
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:02,175
Let's see.

28
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:08,900
I sent that to your Gmail.

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,820
Okay.

30
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:30,887
Yeah, so tonight we didn't have any applications and no public hearings, but one thing that I had wanted to discuss was, I mean, every year it's always good practice to revisit the rules and regs.

31
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,511
I do want to make sure that it reflects actually what we do.

32
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:40,555
And also I thought it would make sense if it doesn't already to address

33
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:57,154
how remote meetings are handled, because I feel like, you know, that hasn't been, if it's not addressed, then we should address that, remote meetings and hybrid meetings.

34
00:02:57,174 --> 00:02:59,516
It seems like they're

35
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:07,547
At least the hybrid format should be here to stay, or at least be allowed to do, probably in some capacity.

36
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:19,518
We're not sure what the state legislature will have to say about fully remote, but we do have that capability until, I think it's May 2024.

37
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,121
Does anybody know if that's correct?

38
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:24,963
Or is it another year?

39
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:27,465
I feel like time flies.

40
00:03:31,763 --> 00:03:41,087
So if you already have those, then I probably should review those.

41
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:45,829
Let's see if I saw this one.

42
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:16,459
So I saw some that were old and it referenced... It's just to answer the open meet and laugh, the temporary provisions have been extended by Governor Haley until March 31st of 2025.

43
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:16,979
2025, okay.

44
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:20,481
I was hoping it was 2025.

45
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:30,766
Okay, so yeah, there's looking through the rules and regulations and I'm seeing like regular meetings,

46
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,234
and, you know, it doesn't have a set schedule in here.

47
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:44,859
This might have been before that happened, but there's talks about closing of agendas, you know, meeting.

48
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,360
Would you mind pulling this up and sharing the screen so we can all be on the same page?

49
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,240
Sure thing.

50
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,963
I know it's in the folder, but just, you can see exactly what you're looking at.

51
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,104
Thank you, Danielle.

52
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:04,217
Can you see it?

53
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:07,838
So I'm not sure if, so this was adopted July 14, 2022.

54
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:08,979
Okay.

55
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,560
So that was, okay, that was more than a year ago.

56
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,701
That's like a year and a half ago now.

57
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:19,602
Yeah.

58
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:20,582
And this is.

59
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:22,102
Composition of the board.

60
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:29,625
If I'm not mistaken, this has been given to each board member since as, as brought on, correct?

61
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:30,645
No.

62
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:33,785
I was not given this as part of my onboarding.

63
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:39,492
That was the intention, so I'm not sure where that was left at.

64
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:47,661
If this was only reviewed a year and a half ago, do we really need to revisit this now?

65
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:52,187
I mean, it's good to

66
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:58,344
at least look at it every year and see if there's anything that needs to be updated.

67
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:11,369
Like so, for example, regular meetings held monthly on a weekday at no time earlier than 6, in a conference room.

68
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,229
Let's see.

69
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:15,770
Yeah, I definitely think so.

70
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,811
I can only speak for myself.

71
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,512
It warrants us to go through it.

72
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:21,572
It's just I didn't know how much we would get through it tonight.

73
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:22,073
No, no.

74
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:30,266
One of the things I want to be clear on is that we definitely have to do some adjustments, right?

75
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:38,949
And that's even administrative sort of things with the filing of applications and shutting them down.

76
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:52,335
We had discussed that previously as a board, just going forward and, like, you don't want to get something on a Friday night and then have to, like, scramble to read it over the weekend for the following week, kind of.

77
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:54,425
Yeah, so my opinion.

78
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:56,367
Yes, no, absolutely.

79
00:06:56,387 --> 00:07:05,335
And through the chair, all the expectations of the board and staff should be in this document.

80
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:12,422
So you do not need to vote on this tonight, but just something to start like thinking about.

81
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:12,482
So

82
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:29,931
Yeah, and just giving the board some time to digest it and see if there's anything that you can recommend or that you want to discuss as a group on what can be changed.

83
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:42,062
I see that there have been substantial updates from the version that I saw, which really needed work.

84
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,344
This seems closer to

85
00:07:49,503 --> 00:08:02,791
how we do things, but I'll have to, I'm not prepared to recommend changes at this point, because I'm just seeing this now.

86
00:08:04,112 --> 00:08:06,093
So I have my hand raised.

87
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:09,115
I don't know who can see it, but I'd love to be recognized.

88
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:12,568
Yeah, go ahead, Emily.

89
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:14,128
Okay, through the chair.

90
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:25,133
So, Danielle, you're just seeing this now, and I'm behind Jackie, like the longest running member of the board, and I haven't seen this.

91
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:38,499
Can we just table this discussion and take the action of let's distribute this and have staff go through, make any suggested changes, and then, you know, the board will make any suggested changes.

92
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,320
We can discuss this at a later date.

93
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,041
just to efficiently use all of our time this evening?

94
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:47,981
Certainly.

95
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:48,882
Okay.

96
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:50,842
Do I need to make a motion for that?

97
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:53,823
I mean, it's just a discussion item.

98
00:08:53,863 --> 00:09:04,365
So, I mean, I just- Yeah, not so much a motion at this point, but I'm interested in knowing the feedback from other board members, and it just can be, again, how it'll go forward.

99
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:10,407
Because I'm sure no one, you're not going to be able to take this in right now.

100
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:10,967
We might go away.

101
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:17,127
and be like, oh, we should have said this, we should have said that.

102
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,049
But again, it's like Daniel said, it's more of an open discussion.

103
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,789
Yeah.

104
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:23,930
I'm going to need time to go read it.

105
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:25,511
I'm going to get a copy of it.

106
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:26,331
Yeah.

107
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:31,874
This is different than the one that I saw attached to the agenda that was sent out.

108
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:37,997
It's a great topic for discussion, but I don't think we can have it right now.

109
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:47,731
But through the chair, I'm glad we brought it up, because if you guys don't actually have it, then that's good information to have.

110
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:58,282
It is good information, because from my understanding, this would be given to every new board member as part of their onboarding, and it sounds like no one has it.

111
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:00,985
That's correct.

112
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:13,193
I'd like to suggest that we might actually think about, is there a place in these rules and regs that we literally put that, right?

113
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,014
Like that that's the.

114
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:18,796
So make sure that all board members have it on.

115
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:20,677
Yeah.

116
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:30,682
Again, can we distribute the material and then discuss and move on to another agenda item this evening?

117
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:32,963
I think we're all in agreement about

118
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:40,348
Um, the importance of this, but you know, just trying to use everybody's time efficiently this evening.

119
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:55,405
Yeah, no, I hear what you're saying, but at the same time, I'm a little, since we have a meeting and we're open, I'm trying to just get more feedback from other board members and not just like, just my hearing myself for.

120
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:57,498
Anyone else have?

121
00:10:58,379 --> 00:10:59,359
Yeah, I agree.

122
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:03,981
We need time to read it and review it and then come back together and we'll put it, let's put it on an agenda.

123
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:06,942
Okay.

124
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:17,346
So that's, that's pretty much my feeling from the beginning, but I just want to make sure that I'm not like tabling it and other people wanting to discuss it.

125
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:21,168
And in that case, I guess we can just, if someone wants to give the motion, I guess.

126
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:33,543
I'll make a motion to table the discussion on the Community Development Board rules and regulations until a future meeting date.

127
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:35,805
Second.

128
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:43,910
Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

129
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:45,470
Aye.

130
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:48,132
Ari Fishman?

131
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:49,033
Aye.

132
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,734
Pam Mariansky?

133
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:51,394
Aye.

134
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:52,855
Sally Akiki?

135
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:52,935
Aye.

136
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,500
Wait, she's not here.

137
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,961
Sharad Bhattacharya?

138
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,062
Aye.

139
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:02,763
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

140
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:03,483
I'm an aye.

141
00:12:05,944 --> 00:12:10,306
And so the next item, Daniel, was fee schedules.

142
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:15,989
Do you want to lead us in discussion on what you were thinking with the fee schedules?

143
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:17,609
Yes.

144
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:23,352
So it doesn't seem that... So the only fee that

145
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:26,877
We have a site plan review.

146
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:33,221
The schedule doesn't contemplate that the city board is a special permit granting authority.

147
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:49,032
And so when we get applications, it's either we don't collect a fee at all or ask for $100, which is what the fee is for zoning board and city council, which are also very low.

148
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:53,495
And if an applicant said there's

149
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:57,933
There's actually no fee here, and we probably couldn't compel them to pay that.

150
00:12:59,774 --> 00:13:01,995
But special permits from the other boards are $100.

151
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:08,819
But I have, let's see, I'll share my screen again.

152
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:18,244
This is a kind of what I am proposing.

153
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:24,465
If you look into the meeting folder, there is a spreadsheet.

154
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:38,677
We pulled the permitting fees of various land use boards in some of the surrounding cities and towns and peer communities to see kind of where we're at.

155
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:43,861
They haven't been updated since, I think, 1974 or something close to that.

156
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:48,525
So they're really, really low, like basement bargain low.

157
00:13:49,209 --> 00:14:09,304
and we're not, you know, for a city that has a revenue problem, we need to at least more closely cover the expenses or, you know, come closer to that, the business of permitting.

158
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:18,190
I know the building department updates their fees, but for some reason they haven't been for planning and zoning.

159
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:28,000
Um, so I propose that for special permits for use, um, that when the CDB is the SPGA, that'd be $300.

160
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:41,051
Um, and when it's the referral board, uh, $200, uh, reflecting that the work of writing decision and filing in it, it's, and, um, having to

161
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:46,770
send out notices and do all the postings is more work.

162
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:49,052
Still, it doesn't come close to covering time.

163
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:55,875
But cities aren't supposed to operate as a business, like a profit business, but it shouldn't be basically free.

164
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:06,401
And since the city board sees mostly larger developers, this wouldn't really be impacting your everyday resident.

165
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:12,830
We currently don't have a fee for special permit for detached ADUs.

166
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:17,933
So I'm proposing a $250 fee for that.

167
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:31,902
I don't know if there is a fee for, I imagine it's just a building permit fee for the ones that are by right that your board doesn't see and we don't see.

168
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:47,460
And then for a site plan review, currently the fee is 5 cents a square foot over 5,000 square feet for non-residential and 5 cents a square foot over 3,000 square feet.

169
00:15:48,620 --> 00:16:00,647
There are, looking through what's considered a major project, there are technically major projects that wouldn't incur a fee at all.

170
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:07,319
based on that calculation method.

171
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,141
For example, the convenience stores, those are considered.

172
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:16,102
So it's convenience retail and neighborhood retail.

173
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:20,163
One of them is defined as being under 2,500 square feet.

174
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:20,983
So that would be free.

175
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,813
which doesn't make sense.

176
00:16:28,273 --> 00:16:35,397
So I'm proposing that there be a base fee for all site plan review, which is pretty standard everywhere else.

177
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:40,900
And then to increase the fee from $0.05 to $0.10.

178
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:55,147
Again, this was from 1974, so it's still not a huge jump, and still lower than some payer communities.

179
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:08,132
So I'm proposing 500, so sticking to 3,000 for residential, I think that's what it is now.

180
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:12,775
Yeah, so I didn't change the 3,000 square foot threshold for residential.

181
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:25,403
And for non-residential, I bumped it down to 2,000 square feet to reflect some of the actual uses that come in.

182
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:33,119
And through the chair, it looks like member Emily has her hand raised.

183
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,540
Yes, Emily.

184
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,741
Sorry, I can't see my entire screen.

185
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:40,401
No, you're good.

186
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:42,342
That's why I figured I'd mention it that last time.

187
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:46,323
And thanks for calling it out, Danielle.

188
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:54,405
Through the chair, Danielle, you mentioned that, you know, this would potentially help the city with their revenue deficit.

189
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:03,723
What is the projected revenue from the increase in fees, just based on the last couple of years of applications?

190
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:06,004
Do you have that figure?

191
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:07,484
I don't have that.

192
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:08,385
OK.

193
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:14,287
I'm requesting that from our clerk to see.

194
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:21,210
Basically, I don't have, since I've only just started staffing the board,

195
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:26,589
I don't have, um, I think it must be in a folder that I don't have access to or don't know where it is.

196
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:34,471
Um, I'm assuming, I don't know if Alicia is still on the call, if there is a log somewhere of the filing fees.

197
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:43,513
Um, yeah, I just, I'm interested in that number just to understand like the scale of like what this decision would mean for the department, for the city.

198
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:49,635
Um, and then the other question I have is, you know,

199
00:18:50,132 --> 00:19:05,503
If we as a board approve fee increases, whether they're as proposed on this, uh, page or, or, you know, adjusted, you know, do we need approval by any other bodies to change these fees or is it purely up to us?

200
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:07,585
It's purely up to you guys.

201
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:08,425
Yeah.

202
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:17,952
These are planned board, but it's up to the office of, uh, it's up to Daniel's office to make sure that we're in compliance with, uh,

203
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,239
the amounts that we can charge.

204
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:22,440
What does that mean?

205
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,281
It sounds like Danielle has done it.

206
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:32,285
Like, um, whatever the fees or just, like, just, like, develop.

207
00:19:33,145 --> 00:19:38,708
If I'm not mistaken, Danielle, it's the same, like, if we were charging developer, like, some kind of fee or something like that, right?

208
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:44,451
We have to make sure that we're in compliance and that we're not overcharging for certain things, or is this more administrative?

209
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:48,213
Um, I'm not aware of, like, any

210
00:19:49,941 --> 00:20:02,972
state law that's capped, if there is, based on we're still below peer communities.

211
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:05,494
I don't know.

212
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:09,057
I think that it's, you know,

213
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:27,518
It's sort of like if someone doesn't get a raise for 10 years, or you don't increase the rent in 10 years, that the jump's going to look pretty big.

214
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:32,663
But it's because it hasn't been done incrementally or updated.

215
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:37,967
As I said, I think it was the 70s that they were last updated.

216
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:50,621
For example, also like the Bank of America, that one that we spent so much time on, we actually didn't even get a fee from them.

217
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:54,704
It was just $100 fee to the city council.

218
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:58,888
That was it, a huge corporation.

219
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:09,997
So they have to be updated and it's the purview of this board to update them.

220
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:17,233
at least according to our rules and regs and our zoning ordinance.

221
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,475
In Somerville, I don't ever remember voting on fees.

222
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:21,996
I think it was just set by staff.

223
00:21:22,317 --> 00:21:22,957
We didn't see them.

224
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:35,207
But per our ordinance and the rules and regs, you all can set them.

225
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:40,908
And just to help Jackie, I think Emily had her hand up again.

226
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:41,908
Did you lower it?

227
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:43,189
You just answered my question.

228
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:43,790
OK.

229
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:49,594
In terms of does it need to be this board or can it continue to be staff?

230
00:21:49,994 --> 00:21:52,656
But it sounds like there's an ordinance that means it has to be this board.

231
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:58,281
Yeah, I think it's like perhaps it could be staff.

232
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:04,946
But I think to err on the side of to be conservative that sometimes staff

233
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:10,050
is the representative of the board, and we can do some things administratively.

234
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:20,754
But I feel it would make sense to have this voted on by the board just to be extra careful.

235
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:27,256
And so one of the other items is ANRs.

236
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:31,886
currently they're only $50.

237
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,648
So I proposed changing.

238
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:37,809
So two tiers to that.

239
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,671
So for revising a lot line $100.

240
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:48,535
And if it's an A&R that creates new lots, then to charge 150 a new lot.

241
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:50,336
And I was basically, I

242
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:56,921
Plucked those numbers looking at kind of what was the ballpark of neighboring communities.

243
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:58,761
That's how I came up with those.

244
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:04,585
I was trying to get my hands on the subdivision.

245
00:23:04,605 --> 00:23:13,409
These is I couldn't believe that it was really only $50, but I think it might really only be $50.

246
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:13,529
So.

247
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:24,811
I'd want to make sure that there was a fee for preliminary plan and for definitive plan.

248
00:23:25,431 --> 00:23:27,952
And I mean, we don't see a lot of subdivisions.

249
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:35,034
So that one is not as probably urgent.

250
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:44,616
And so we don't necessarily have to vote on all of these tonight, but trying to gauge

251
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,320
the will of the court.

252
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:52,476
Sorry, Katie.

253
00:23:54,763 --> 00:24:01,107
For myself, going back to something Emily said, I didn't... I guess I mixed this up with, like, developer impact fees.

254
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:06,130
You know, that can be... that can violate Fifth Amendment if we don't... because it's regulatory, right?

255
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,512
We have to make sure that we're within reason.

256
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:14,856
And so since this is more like an administrative kind of staff thing, it's just building a case for us to pretty much adopt.

257
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:20,059
And I guess we just need a little bit more information on... Obviously, we know it's going to impact

258
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:28,605
the city somewhat for the deficit, but just give us something to vote on, I think, a little bit more background.

259
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:49,439
I see you did the research, but I would love to know, like, what we're charging versus another one, another community that's near us or something like that, just to see where we're at in comparison, just so that people have more confidence to vote on what you're presenting, because, again, this should still be, to me, a city staff kind of thing.

260
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:52,359
But since it's not.

261
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,561
So do you see this table here?

262
00:24:58,623 --> 00:24:59,063
I'm sorry.

263
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,224
I don't want to be rude.

264
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:02,806
I'm going off camera just to grab my plug.

265
00:25:02,906 --> 00:25:04,387
I'm not going to turn the camera off.

266
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:06,028
And I'm just going to jump up and grab my plug.

267
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:07,649
Sorry.

268
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:09,270
Danielle, did you email?

269
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,113
I think this was in the folder that you sent to us.

270
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:17,796
So if people, in my case, it's easier for me to click on it and see it myself, then

271
00:25:19,573 --> 00:25:29,605
So this table of the reference fees that everybody that shows what other communities are charging is in the link in the folder that Danielle sent around.

272
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:31,968
If anybody wants the link, I could grab that now.

273
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:52,212
Madam Chair, it appears Emily has her hand up.

274
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:53,132
Oh, yes, Emily.

275
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,173
Let me know if you want me to stop doing that too.

276
00:25:56,693 --> 00:26:02,295
No, no, I just I'm trying to work from two different and I just can't see everyone because it's suppressed.

277
00:26:02,315 --> 00:26:02,915
I'm sorry.

278
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,256
Very good.

279
00:26:05,276 --> 00:26:15,339
So just to clarify, like the intent for this evening, what are you looking for us to do to discuss to request follow up information to approve?

280
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:33,831
I mean, if you were comfortable approving the fee schedule in the folder, I would accept a vote tonight, because then we could start charging those fees.

281
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:39,374
Or then because the next meeting won't be until the 10th.

282
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:49,406
Do you need more information?

283
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:51,007
Do you feel they're too low?

284
00:26:51,027 --> 00:27:04,991
I mean, I would just turn it back to the chair to see if, you know, this is something she's, you know, comfortable, you know, potentially voting on this evening or, you know, maybe it's a discussion.

285
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:14,194
Well, for this item itself, just because, I mean, I don't want to be the odd one out, but I'm,

286
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:24,411
I definitely have an idea of how low our fees are already, but I have more of an advantage based on dealing with other cities and towns.

287
00:27:24,531 --> 00:27:30,916
And so the fact that we are so low, but I don't want that to be a reason why I'm ready to vote.

288
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:35,059
I would need the entire board to feel confident and vote in.

289
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,805
One of my biggest questions to Danielle was just what does that entail to bring you guys to confidence?

290
00:27:49,963 --> 00:28:01,169
I mean, without me even saying that I know other communities and what they charge, the fact that this hasn't been done in 1974, since 1974, that's a reason to up them.

291
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:03,050
But what do we up them to?

292
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,170
Are we going high enough?

293
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,232
I mean, I'm looking at the sheet right now.

294
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,452
I just feel like it's, yeah.

295
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:13,215
I mean, I appreciate all the work that Danielle has done to pull all these pieces of information together.

296
00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:15,736
But it's like comparing like an apple and an orange and a kiwi.

297
00:28:15,756 --> 00:28:17,457
So I'm trying to like level.

298
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,551
And it's hard to do on one screen.

299
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:24,472
So I'm here.

300
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:25,273
I'm thinking about it.

301
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:31,235
I mean, it seems like we're still kind of low based on just my glancing and scrolling up and down.

302
00:28:31,255 --> 00:28:33,095
It seems like we're still kind of low.

303
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:35,656
Do we need to consider even going higher is my only question.

304
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:41,078
And that's exactly where I came to.

305
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:42,379
Are we even going high enough?

306
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,259
And will we have to revisit this again to go higher?

307
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,060
Will we be doing this a second time?

308
00:28:47,517 --> 00:29:04,262
So from a sort of working with developers perspective, in my mind, it's a good idea to put in some fees and to start charging them and then revisit it in six months or a year and raise them because that gives you,

309
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:12,629
for repeat developers, it gives a chance to ease things in, like letting them know we're starting to charge fees for things.

310
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:15,371
We're still reviewing them.

311
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:16,572
They may go up again.

312
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:23,558
The thing that I really would like to see us raise is our linkage fees, but that actually we need a study.

313
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:28,362
And we've had a really hard time finding somebody willing and able to do that study.

314
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:31,144
And I don't mean a staff person, I mean hiring a consultant.

315
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:36,888
And the last time I asked, we asked a consultant for a price, they wanted like $80,000.

316
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,990
And I'm like, that is ridiculous.

317
00:29:41,852 --> 00:29:45,654
So absent the linkage fee, which it sounds like we shouldn't even be discussing this evening.

318
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:50,157
Maybe we have kind of this like, pilot, like fee raise.

319
00:29:50,177 --> 00:29:55,081
I like your idea, Alicia about like a six month fee raise.

320
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:56,782
I think just

321
00:29:57,937 --> 00:30:15,109
in order to, like, be transparent, I think we should do, like, a month notice for this and say, like, you know, effective, you know, say we voted on it this evening, 12-20, you know, effective January 20th, or whenever we decide, you know, the fees will be this.

322
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:18,431
And then we test that out for six months, and then we revisit it.

323
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:22,574
And, Ari, I'm sorry, I just saw your hand up.

324
00:30:22,634 --> 00:30:24,235
I'm sorry if I jumped in front of you.

325
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:26,937
No, I think that...

326
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:30,016
think those are good ideas and I agree with them.

327
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:51,141
The other thing I wanted to throw in is I think that we should also, if we're doing this, take the opportunity to prevent it from going another 50 years before it's going and potentially put in language like this should be revisited once every two years, once every five years.

328
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:54,821
I don't really care what that number is as long as it is a number.

329
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:57,182
Put that in the rules and rigs.

330
00:30:57,955 --> 00:30:59,556
Yep.

331
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:00,476
Right.

332
00:31:00,596 --> 00:31:03,157
And actually, I'll tell you that that that is a good idea.

333
00:31:03,337 --> 00:31:07,418
Linkage says to revisit every three years is in the linkage rules.

334
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:14,620
And it's because it's never been raised that I feel that we need to study and we can't just do it.

335
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:22,363
But I think having it in there because it was in the rules that made me start asking the question, why haven't we raised these?

336
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:32,935
So I think by putting it in the rules, maybe we wouldn't raise them again in three years, but at least it would prompt us and it would warn people.

337
00:31:34,597 --> 00:31:36,960
And honestly, I would recommend

338
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:48,614
put something in place now, we could also then gather some more information, collect any feedback into the anecdotal, and revisit it in six months.

339
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:54,455
And in the meantime, put it in that it should be reviewed at least every three years.

340
00:31:54,916 --> 00:32:02,038
And by saying at least that would allow you to say, actually, we need to do this sooner or not.

341
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:22,475
So through the chair, I can put this back on the screen, the fee schedule.

342
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:30,903
And again, the linkage fees are the same as impact fees, right?

343
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:35,327
That's allowed through special... I will tell you legally, no.

344
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:48,681
Our linkage fees are allowed by home rule petition and are therefore separate from the regulatory rules around impact fees.

345
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:55,965
That's part of why the difficulty in updating those because it's actually different from what's going on in the rest of the state.

346
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:59,087
Are linkage fees on the table this evening?

347
00:32:59,107 --> 00:32:59,147
No.

348
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:05,650
I just sort of wanted to mention that as a side thing because I don't want people to forget about them.

349
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:06,331
Yeah.

350
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:11,945
And I appreciate that, but maybe let's stay focused on the board fees.

351
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:14,207
So we don't get those confused.

352
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:20,755
So what do we need to move this forward tonight?

353
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:21,215
I'm sorry.

354
00:33:23,347 --> 00:33:27,672
1, 2nd, and my question regarding the link histories, because we're tabling it.

355
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:36,943
Someone had asked earlier if we can table the link histories and be separate and I wanted to make sure and Alicia had responded saying that you needed a study and everything like that.

356
00:33:37,003 --> 00:33:41,168
So I wanted the board to have a full understanding that that was like a regulatory thing.

357
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:46,201
or if it was through legislation or if it's something that we can even discuss going forward.

358
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:47,682
So I wanted to make sure that that was clear.

359
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:49,864
And Alicia has answered that question.

360
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:58,733
So again, I guess us voting tonight would be, it would definitely take linkage fees off the table, but what does that look for us?

361
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:01,095
What does that look like for us going forward anyways?

362
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,141
Sorry, I'm mildly confused because I don't think linkage fees was on.

363
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:20,345
I think there was some confusion because as we started to discuss this, there was a confusion between fees that were regulated by the state like development fees versus your permit fees.

364
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:25,446
But we had not actually put linkage fees on the agenda for tonight.

365
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:30,428
Okay, sorry.

366
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:37,496
permit filing fees for the community development board.

367
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:46,201
And going back to Emily's question, um, to move the board forward, what do we need to establish tonight?

368
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:48,843
Um, are we voting?

369
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:53,966
Is there, are we in a position to vote or are we tabling this to the next meeting?

370
00:34:58,749 --> 00:35:00,430
And that's me opening it up to the board.

371
00:35:03,006 --> 00:35:03,546
I could vote.

372
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,731
And can we just clarify what we're voting on?

373
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,712
Are we voting to adopt these fees?

374
00:35:14,773 --> 00:35:20,276
Are we voting to adopt these fees with the provision that they'll be revisited at a certain time?

375
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:26,219
I was thinking the latter when I said I would vote.

376
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:28,120
But that's a good clarification.

377
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:33,845
Yeah, I'm sorry, I had loosely heard, we didn't put it in writing.

378
00:35:34,785 --> 00:35:35,566
We didn't capture it.

379
00:35:35,606 --> 00:35:41,007
But basically, the conversation had bounced back, like, I don't know, give it a date, sir.

380
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:50,109
And I like Emily's idea of maybe like rolling this out in a month, get given some time, and then, you know, let them know that it's coming.

381
00:35:50,129 --> 00:35:51,410
And then maybe look at it later.

382
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,210
And it'd be more incremental later.

383
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,691
But right now, roll this out, and give them time.

384
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,072
So I guess, yeah.

385
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:17,384
Can I make a motion to vote for adopting this fee table effective January 20th, which is a month from now with a scheduled revisit in six months time.

386
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:21,287
Can I propose a mild adjustment to that?

387
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:22,828
Yeah.

388
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:27,311
Adopting this effective January 31st

389
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:34,770
just recognizing that it's the holiday season, and we want to probably post something to the website.

390
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,293
So I'd want to give staff enough time to make that change.

391
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:42,996
That is extremely reasonable.

392
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:43,717
Thank you, Emily.

393
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,459
Just thinking about the humans behind this.

394
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:51,503
I'm not sure if client fees are even on the website.

395
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:54,485
So we have to create a website.

396
00:36:59,715 --> 00:37:03,218
So we see your chat.

397
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:09,303
Yeah, Danielle, you're sharing your whole screen, not just one window.

398
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:10,504
How do I do that?

399
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,227
How did you share the whole screen?

400
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:15,788
Let's see.

401
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:16,508
OK, I'll just.

402
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:18,230
Why is it doing that?

403
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:20,191
Sorry.

404
00:37:20,211 --> 00:37:24,675
Does Ari need to re-motion?

405
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,981
Oh, Peter has joined us.

406
00:37:29,061 --> 00:37:30,643
Peter, did you hear enough to even?

407
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:38,789
Oh, I was gonna say I'm gonna, like, abstain, or should I abstain or something like that?

408
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,312
Because I only came in for the last 10 minutes.

409
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:44,715
Sorry about that.

410
00:37:44,775 --> 00:37:47,397
It somehow took me an hour to get from Cambridge back to Medford.

411
00:37:47,437 --> 00:37:49,298
But no, don't worry.

412
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:53,022
So it took my husband and I nearly 40 minutes to get from Medford to Medford tonight.

413
00:37:56,346 --> 00:37:59,887
We went to get pizza and avelinos and we couldn't get home.

414
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,267
I'm exaggerating.

415
00:38:03,307 --> 00:38:04,847
It wasn't 40 minutes, but it was forever.

416
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:13,809
We're going to do the word play again.

417
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:16,589
If you could try one more time, Ari, sorry.

418
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:24,791
I propose a motion to adopt the stated fee schedule effective January 31st.

419
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:31,738
with a scheduled revisit in six months' time.

420
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:35,440
I'll second the motion.

421
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,061
Okay.

422
00:38:37,702 --> 00:38:38,222
Roll call.

423
00:38:38,642 --> 00:38:39,863
Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

424
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:40,644
Aye.

425
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:44,186
Peter Kautz is abstaining.

426
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:45,407
Ari Fishman?

427
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:46,568
Aye.

428
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:49,089
Pam Ariansky?

429
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:49,830
Aye.

430
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,851
Chirag Bhatracharya?

431
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,992
Aye.

432
00:38:54,913 --> 00:39:02,337
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an I. Okay, and we have minutes.

433
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:06,059
The next item on the agenda is minutes for, is it from 11?

434
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,961
Let's see.

435
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:18,907
All right, I have two prep documents open here.

436
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:31,559
All right, is there a motion to approve the minutes from 11-15-23?

437
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,560
Motion.

438
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,542
A second?

439
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:39,623
Second.

440
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:49,567
Okay, Vice Chair Emily Hedeman, oh, were you, you could.

441
00:39:49,627 --> 00:39:50,667
I was gonna abstain.

442
00:39:51,228 --> 00:39:52,548
Okay.

443
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:55,810
Just to let you know, going forward, one of the things that I've learned

444
00:39:58,293 --> 00:39:59,434
Correct me if I'm wrong, Danielle.

445
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:03,457
Even if you weren't there, you're just voting the minutes to be filed.

446
00:40:03,597 --> 00:40:05,878
You don't have to have been there.

447
00:40:06,478 --> 00:40:07,319
Is that correct, Danielle?

448
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:08,239
It's true.

449
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,140
Okay.

450
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,461
But you can also abstain.

451
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:12,682
That's your right.

452
00:40:14,983 --> 00:40:15,804
Peter Kautz?

453
00:40:17,505 --> 00:40:17,625
Aye.

454
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:19,706
Ari Fishman?

455
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:20,947
Aye.

456
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:22,988
Pam Mariansky?

457
00:40:23,448 --> 00:40:23,588
Aye.

458
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:26,030
Sharad Vajracharya?

459
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:27,634
Aye.

460
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:30,416
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

461
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:32,658
Okay.

462
00:40:33,038 --> 00:40:38,161
Um, and before adjournment, there's, are there any miscellaneous or other updates?

463
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:43,004
Um, is this where you want to discuss the meeting schedule for 2024, Danielle?

464
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:44,685
Yeah.

465
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:49,909
So let's see, that is in the folder.

466
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:53,191
So I wanted you, I think this is the first year that we've

467
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:58,288
had a meeting schedule set in advance all on one piece of paper.

468
00:40:58,308 --> 00:41:01,689
Let's see, where is?

469
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,090
Do you guys see it?

470
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,631
And now I'm like, I have to go back.

471
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:12,051
You're not sharing anything now.

472
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:15,072
Thank goodness.

473
00:41:15,812 --> 00:41:20,193
And I just dropped a link for anybody who wants to just open it locally.

474
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,382
So it's mostly keeping to the first and third.

475
00:41:29,402 --> 00:41:39,031
So January, we're bumping out to second.

476
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:40,552
Does everyone have that?

477
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:41,993
No?

478
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:46,177
I think it's better to just do it this way so we can see each other.

479
00:41:51,102 --> 00:41:53,103
So it's mostly first and third, so you remember that.

480
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:56,546
And then italicized is when it departs from that.

481
00:41:59,948 --> 00:42:05,972
They've been shifted for Juneteenth, I think, Eid.

482
00:42:06,332 --> 00:42:11,615
There's some other holidays we want to work around.

483
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:21,507
They do fall on the school vacation weeks, which isn't good for me, but I couldn't figure out a way to shift them better.

484
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:34,519
So if I can't staff it, then I see if somebody else can, or if there's no business, then maybe we could bump it or cancel it.

485
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:39,003
But I wouldn't be shocked if there wasn't anything in February.

486
00:42:42,232 --> 00:42:54,939
And I propose just one meeting in July, unless there's an A&R and we're beholden to meet within so many days.

487
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,220
We don't get a lot of those.

488
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:06,700
And if it is amenable to the board, I could send out an Outlook calendar invite for all of these at once.

489
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,460
What is the preference?

490
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,601
I don't want to clog up inboxes.

491
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:14,763
But for me, if it's not on my calendar, then it doesn't exist.

492
00:43:15,563 --> 00:43:18,104
In the same way.

493
00:43:18,604 --> 00:43:21,385
So some people put things on their own calendar.

494
00:43:23,786 --> 00:43:26,727
So you don't have to accept them, because you probably don't know.

495
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:28,268
But that's the whole thing.

496
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:29,088
I don't know what to.

497
00:43:30,637 --> 00:43:31,478
Oh, Ari, you're on mute.

498
00:43:31,938 --> 00:43:32,558
Oh, sorry.

499
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:33,439
Please send them.

500
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,581
The earliest, the better.

501
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:38,703
OK, just to get them all there.

502
00:43:38,723 --> 00:43:46,949
I anticipate that the 2nd January and the February meetings will be busy.

503
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:51,352
A lot of site plan review applications coming up.

504
00:43:51,472 --> 00:43:58,838
And there was some delay in trying to find meeting dates because city council doesn't have

505
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:02,611
their 2024 schedule yet.

506
00:44:05,493 --> 00:44:16,122
Before, when they met, when they had regular meetings every week, you didn't have to think about when their meeting was to get them, when they're the Special Permit Granting Authority, because we try to write legal notices for them.

507
00:44:16,142 --> 00:44:17,723
So I didn't know when their meeting.

508
00:44:19,605 --> 00:44:20,826
This calendar looks really good.

509
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:21,567
Thank you, Danielle.

510
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:33,504
And this just, I mean, it works for me, but I want to make sure this, is this a date that we're still, because I remember we changed them to accommodate schedules.

511
00:44:33,744 --> 00:44:35,444
Emily, are you still in school?

512
00:44:35,504 --> 00:44:36,885
Not to put you out, just anyone.

513
00:44:37,145 --> 00:44:42,547
I just want to make sure that this still works for everyone and that you don't need to change it for whatever reason.

514
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:54,239
You mean in terms of day of the week or first and third, or what do you mean, Jackie?

515
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:55,820
I'm sorry, the days of the week.

516
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:03,123
We've tried to accommodate members as much as possible going forward.

517
00:45:03,143 --> 00:45:12,588
Like if there was something else that there was a conflict and we wanted to make sure and you would never be able to be there, then obviously we want to look at a date that we get most of our board members.

518
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:17,411
And it seemed like Wednesday we fell on where everyone could pretty much be there.

519
00:45:18,528 --> 00:45:21,809
Now that there's new members, I just want to make sure that that's still the same.

520
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:27,932
And I also want to make sure that it's still a good day for the former board members.

521
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,313
Wednesday works for me.

522
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:32,053
Okay.

523
00:45:40,357 --> 00:45:41,117
Well, that's all I have.

524
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:49,807
You don't need to formally vote the schedule as long as you guys are comfortable with it.

525
00:45:51,068 --> 00:45:51,888
We can post it.

526
00:45:52,649 --> 00:46:02,272
We can also, Danielle, just as an FYI, you can provide it to our comms department now and they can pre-populate the city calendar as well and that'll make it easier for people.

527
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:08,635
As we wrap up, I just wanted to share our new exciting breaking news as of today.

528
00:46:09,673 --> 00:46:11,654
We have a new economic development director.

529
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:12,914
He has accepted.

530
00:46:14,074 --> 00:46:15,314
He accepted today.

531
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:28,018
I would say that because this is a public meeting, and I don't know if he has told his old job, his current job, that he is leaving, that I'm going to wait a little bit before telling people, but he starts January 15th.

532
00:46:29,558 --> 00:46:37,100
I just want to make sure that he's notified the people he needs to notify, because I've only known for about three hours, so I'm still very excited.

533
00:46:37,972 --> 00:46:48,439
And I think we told you at our last meeting that we also have an academic development planner starting January 3rd and a housing planner starting January 2nd.

534
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,483
So we are going to be fully staffed by the middle of January.

535
00:46:55,685 --> 00:46:58,967
Well, at least for our existing positions, and then I'm going to fight for more, so.

536
00:47:00,808 --> 00:47:02,169
And you'll pay for them with the fees.

537
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:05,191
Yeah.

538
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:06,012
Yeah.

539
00:47:08,169 --> 00:47:08,509
All right.

540
00:47:12,012 --> 00:47:12,832
That's exciting.

541
00:47:13,112 --> 00:47:15,034
I'm happy that you're fully staffed.

542
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:18,636
Yes.

543
00:47:18,856 --> 00:47:20,337
So anyhow, happy holidays.

544
00:47:20,357 --> 00:47:24,320
That just made my holiday, but I wanted to share it with all of you.

545
00:47:27,382 --> 00:47:29,383
I hope everybody gets to take some time off.

546
00:47:32,545 --> 00:47:35,147
Well, for my eldest daughter, it's her birthday.

547
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:36,228
It's not Christmas, so.

548
00:47:40,133 --> 00:47:41,594
We're going to celebrate her birthday.

549
00:47:42,154 --> 00:47:43,735
Everybody gets a holiday for her birthday.

550
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:44,235
Yeah.

551
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:49,598
I mean, like, not that everybody celebrates it, but like, things are closed.

552
00:47:49,919 --> 00:47:51,099
Yeah, definitely.

553
00:47:51,439 --> 00:47:52,320
A vacation day.

554
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,280
That's what I should say.

555
00:47:56,202 --> 00:47:58,703
I'm going to do a roll call attendance.

556
00:47:58,864 --> 00:48:02,466
If there's no other updates or anything that anyone wanted to share.

557
00:48:02,486 --> 00:48:05,387
I will do a roll call for adjournment.

558
00:48:06,728 --> 00:48:06,848
Yeah.

559
00:48:09,155 --> 00:48:10,617
Vice Chair Emily Hederman.

560
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:11,558
Aye.

561
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,041
Peter Cowes.

562
00:48:13,621 --> 00:48:13,742
Aye.

563
00:48:14,503 --> 00:48:15,164
Ari Fishman.

564
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:16,265
Aye.

565
00:48:16,746 --> 00:48:17,647
Pam Marianski.

566
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:18,388
Aye.

567
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:20,491
Sherrod Butchbacheria.

568
00:48:21,653 --> 00:48:21,913
Aye.

569
00:48:22,614 --> 00:48:23,896
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

570
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:24,256
I'm an aye.
