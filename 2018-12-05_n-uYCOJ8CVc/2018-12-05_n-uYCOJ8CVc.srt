[SPEAKER_14]: The meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:57,744
[SPEAKER_02]: The secretary will call the roll.

[SPEAKER_02]: Present, seven present, none absent.

[SPEAKER_02]: We also have in attendance Jasper Sue from Medford High School.

5
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:18,952
[SPEAKER_02]: All please rise and salute our flag.

6
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:52,334
[SPEAKER_02]: This just doesn't seem right.

7
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:55,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like everything is on.

8
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:57,077
[SPEAKER_02]: John, we're having a problem.

9
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:14,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Test.

10
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:02,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is the Title I grant.

11
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:10,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And the descriptor just doesn't give a good indication, but the program is Title I funding.

12
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:25,935
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

13
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:30,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

14
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,152
[SPEAKER_01]: and the vendor, Melissa and Doug, they put together a short list.

00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:23,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnetic hide and seek board, wooden block set, nesting and sorting barn animals, alphabet nesting and stacking blocks, lacing beads, a vehicle chunky puzzle, big button number fun, wooden bear family dress-up puzzle, match and roll shape sorter, stacking blocks.

16
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,260
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just wonderful, great educational toys.

17
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:28,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

18
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:53,651
[SPEAKER_01]: November 6, the purpose of our meeting was to discuss some homework we received at the MASC Retreat Session No.

19
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:53,651
1.

20
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:58,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Our job was to develop some key functions that would fit well with our school committee.

21
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:01,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of you received a draft copy in your committee packets.

22
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:07,682
[SPEAKER_01]: This evening, we had another follow-up meeting at 6.30 p.m.

23
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:11,065
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Executive Session Room No. 207.

24
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:22,165
[SPEAKER_01]: And so currently, right now, we have made a motion to have a final draft ready for you at the next meeting on December 17th.

25
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:27,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So please disregard the draft that you have right now, and we're going to get you an updated draft by the next meeting.

26
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:32,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive the supports listed on the file?

27
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:33,868
Seconded by Ms.

28
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:36,688

29
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:36,989
Seconded by Ms.

30
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:37,429
Peterson.

31
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:37,829
All those in favor?

32
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:37,909
Aye.

33
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:38,609
All those opposed?

34
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:47,193
We'll go on recording, Superintendent.

35
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:47,957
[SPEAKER_08]: On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to participate, the Wednesday right before Thanksgiving, I had the opportunity to participate in my first Medford High School, our Mustang pep rally.

36
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,997
[SPEAKER_08]: That was truly a phenomenal event.

37
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:52,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting this.

38
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:54,138
[SPEAKER_14]: She was amazing, amazing.

39
00:13:56,682 --> 00:14:20,048
[SPEAKER_08]: It was truly a phenomenal event, seeing the excitement of the team, the staff, the unified spirit of everyone, and really cheering on our Mustangs and a great performance by our band, our cheerleaders, and it was just a wonderful time of the school coming together and really celebrating.

40
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:26,109
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a wonderful event, the pep rally, my first pep rally, and I definitely am looking forward

41
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,233
[SPEAKER_08]: to many more.

42
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:33,002
[SPEAKER_08]: We were accompanied by the mayor and many members of the school committee.

43
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:36,743
[SPEAKER_08]: were able to come out as well and support the pep rally.

44
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:38,984
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was an enjoyable event.

45
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:44,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to just recognize all of our Medford Mustang football players.

46
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:47,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I say that our players have heart.

47
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:52,430
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, Thanksgiving Day was one of the coldest days on record.

48
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,412
[SPEAKER_08]: And so our Mustangs, they gave it their all.

49
00:14:57,232 --> 00:15:00,854
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did have a tough loss, but it was very close.

50
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:03,055
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 28 to 24 with Malden.

51
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:15,180
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to just say a great thanks, a special thanks to Coach Nascimento, all of his staff, all of the players, the family members that were there, Headmaster DeLeva and

52
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Principal Fallon, they were also present.

53
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:29,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Many directors, I was able to make it there with my son and really, I saw a member, Van der Kloot, there as well, braving the cold.

54
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:33,132
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we still were able to have a very enjoyable Thanksgiving.

55
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:38,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I want to just recognize our Medford Mustangs and say just for them, go Mustangs!

56
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,457
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to continue to support you.

57
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:43,939
[SPEAKER_08]: So last Monday,

58
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,681
[SPEAKER_08]: When we came back off of the Thanksgiving break, we had our second retreat with the school committee.

59
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:59,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a team, we had an opportunity with my leadership team as well, Associate Superintendent Caldwell and Assistant Superintendent Patterson.

60
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:12,729
[SPEAKER_08]: We were able to have rich discussions with Dorothy Presser from MASC, who was our presenter, and my coach from NSUP, Dr. Carla Baer, as well, who participated, and we were

61
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:22,599
[SPEAKER_08]: beginning to kind of lay the foundation of what is to come, my goals, what will come by the end of the year, my district improvement goals.

62
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I look forward to those retreats and I thank you all for participating in that with me.

63
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:33,523
[SPEAKER_08]: on Friday that just happened this past weekend.

64
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:37,787
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always a lot happening in Medford, so I want to keep everyone informed.

65
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:43,892
[SPEAKER_08]: We had our official ribbon-cutting for the new basketball court and the new scoreboard.

66
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:50,658
[SPEAKER_08]: The Leslie Lynx, the basketball team, and our Medford Mustang basketball players were there for the ceremony.

67
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:52,420
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a basketball team

68
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,562
[SPEAKER_08]: a basketball game that was taking place.

69
00:16:56,002 --> 00:17:10,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Burke was there, member Kathy Krutz, Lesley University officials, Medford High coaches, my associate superintendent Diane Caldwell, we all participated in the official opening celebrating the gymnasium and the new scoreboards.

70
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:14,255
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a very happy occasion.

71
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:23,522
[SPEAKER_08]: On this past Saturday, we had a very successful Girls on the Run program that took place at Hormel Stadium.

72
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:36,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Girls on the Run Greater Boston is an independent nonprofit organization affiliated with Girls on the Run International, which has over 200 chapters across the United States.

73
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:49,986
[SPEAKER_08]: This program helps to build competence, confidence, connection, character, caring, and contribution through research-based lessons that incorporate running.

74
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:59,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So girls from the McGlynn Elementary and the Roberts Elementary both fielded teams, and I'd like to just thank Megan Richard,

75
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:06,000
[SPEAKER_08]: for helping to spearhead this initiative along with the coaching staffs at both the McGlynn and the Roberts schools.

76
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:16,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell and McGlynn Elementary Assistant Principal Doreen Andrews were seen there cheering on the girls during that event.

77
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:22,149
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a very positive event for our students and empowering for them.

78
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:34,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, last week we had six Medford High School student-athletes and two coaches attend the 25th annual MIAA Sportsmanship Summit at Gillette Stadium.

79
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:43,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Over 500 student-athletes and coaches from around the state attended breakout sessions throughout the day to learn about the importance of sportsmanship.

80
00:18:45,500 --> 00:19:03,397
[SPEAKER_08]: On Thursday, this coming Thursday, just a reminder to everyone, December 6th at 7.30 in the Caron Theater, Mayor Burke, along with members of the school committee, will be able to honor former long-time school committee member Lina DiGentimaso.

81
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:08,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're going to have the music room named after her.

82
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:20,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I want to thank school committee member Erin DeBenedetto and city council member Michael Marks for their dedication on this particular project.

83
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:29,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And I look forward to seeing you all on Thursday evening to enjoy our wonderful holiday show that will also follow the dedication.

84
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:45,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say from a collaborative level between Medford Public Schools and the City, we are continuing to work collaboratively with the Mayor and the Board of Health as we look at social emotional learning initiatives.

85
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:52,274
[SPEAKER_08]: So that continues to be a top priority for us and we've had many fruitful meetings around that.

86
00:19:53,916 --> 00:20:03,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to just let people know that our winter sports programming has officially started and it's going to begin the second week of December, but get ready for that.

87
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:09,170
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now we're in December, we are entering the season of giving.

88
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,572
[SPEAKER_08]: And Medford Public Schools will be hosting a lot of fundraising activities and events.

89
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:18,673
[SPEAKER_08]: And we hope that the community will be able to join us for those.

90
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:24,475
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mustang Band parents will be continuing to sell Christmas trees.

91
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:28,956
[SPEAKER_08]: They sold trees this weekend and next weekend on Saturday and Sunday.

92
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:34,018
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you are looking for trees, come support the band.

93
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:40,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And they will be selling on Saturday between 11 and 5 and Sunday between 10 and 4.

94
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:50,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford High School and the McGlynn Elementary School, as well as the city of Medford, are collecting new unwrapped toys for the U.S.

95
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:52,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Marines Toys for Tots campaign.

96
00:20:53,411 --> 00:21:00,796
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, please, while you're doing your holiday shopping, please remember those that are less fortunate and work collaboratively with the city.

97
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:03,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Our own Medford Family Network

98
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:08,781
[SPEAKER_08]: is also hosting their Mitten Trail in their classrooms.

99
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:14,185
[SPEAKER_08]: So take a moment to come by and grab a mitten to assist our families that are in need.

100
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:16,787
[SPEAKER_08]: We would greatly appreciate that.

101
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:31,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Medford Vocational Technical High School is once again working with our Rotary Club, the Medford Rotary Club, to put together food baskets for those in need, the donations of non-perishable food items,

102
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,558
[SPEAKER_08]: is greatly appreciated to that cause.

103
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:40,382
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mustang Key Club is conducting a canned food drive for those in need as well.

104
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:48,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are, as a community, as a district, really thinking about helping those that need the help during this holiday time.

105
00:21:49,708 --> 00:22:04,606
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Medford Community Coalition, in collaboration with our Medford Family Network, is hosting a toy drive at the Real Gusto on High Street this Wednesday, December 5th at 6 o'clock.

106
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:08,811
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're able, you are welcome to come support that cause.

107
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:24,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And our Medford Mustang Mall at the high school, which is run by our vocational students in the marketing program, they are having extended holiday shopping hours to the community.

108
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:29,447
[SPEAKER_08]: So please come by and support them between 7, 15, and 4 o'clock.

109
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:32,910
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just encouraging, again, wearing our Mustang gear.

110
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wonderful holiday gifts.

111
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:42,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are a lot of things that are happening in the district over the next, the past few weeks and what's going to be coming.

112
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:59,570
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to just take a quick moment to recognize that we had our own Kathy Madaglio and our parent, Melanie McLaughlin, who is part of our Special Ed, our CPAC team, that they were on NPR and there was a story titled

113
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford Schools Working to Improve Emergency Plans for Students with Disabilities.

114
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:19,696
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was recently aired on NPR and they were interviewed by Carrie Young and Carla Andre, one of our special ed teachers was also involved in that.

115
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:25,138
[SPEAKER_08]: So Medford has a lot happening and I continue to look forward to keeping you updated.

116
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:25,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

117
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:33,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that update.

118
00:23:34,273 --> 00:23:37,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And up next is the report on the superintendent's goals.

119
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:58,366
[SPEAKER_08]: So in your packets, as an educator and an administrator, DESE, Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, has an expectation that all educators

120
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:03,067
[SPEAKER_08]: have goals, and so I myself fall into that category.

121
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:16,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Shared with you are my improvement goals that I worked on collaboratively with the training that I've been receiving at NISPP, the new Superintendent's Induction Program, which is endorsed by DESE.

122
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:27,253
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have provided you with the four goals that I will be working on this year, which kind of overlap and work

123
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:33,797
[SPEAKER_08]: address the work that I also talked to you about a little earlier with my entry plan.

124
00:24:34,718 --> 00:24:40,403
[SPEAKER_08]: So under district improvement goals, effective entry and direction setting.

125
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:53,114
[SPEAKER_08]: And so by the late spring, the district will have a broad understanding from key stakeholder groups about the district's most critical needs and promising strategies that will address them most effectively.

126
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:56,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked about the key actions that were listed there.

127
00:24:56,837 --> 00:24:58,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't go through all of them.

128
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:08,386
[SPEAKER_08]: But the key actions, next report will be coming from me in February in regards to status of the entry plan findings.

129
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:18,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Our next district improvement goal is going to be developing a district-wide focus on instruction.

130
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:33,684
[SPEAKER_08]: So working with principals and other district leaders, I will have working to develop a common language, a common vocabulary about instruction as a foundation for their future work to continue to see improved

131
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:35,566
[SPEAKER_08]: outcomes for our students.

132
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:44,198
[SPEAKER_08]: So working on developing consistent language between all of us who are looking at instruction and evaluating teachers.

133
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:51,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And I detail and explain the learning walks that I will be continuing to conduct

134
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:55,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm working, continuing to collaborate with Lesley University.

135
00:25:56,792 --> 00:26:05,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have given myself the charge of trying to conduct at least five school and classroom visits at each school.

136
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:13,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I expect to exceed that, but that is my expectation to be able to continue to be in schools looking at instruction.

137
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:16,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the end of this academic year,

138
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:27,289
[SPEAKER_08]: to have truly taken the time to have introduced the core actions to all leaders and teachers, and so that rollout has actually already started.

139
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,270
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my second district improvement goal.

140
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:46,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Under student learning goal for elementary mathematics, that was my focus for this year, to improve elementary achievement outcomes in mathematics by deepening teacher and principal knowledge

141
00:26:46,694 --> 00:26:47,635
[SPEAKER_08]: of mathematics.

142
00:26:48,275 --> 00:27:13,515
[SPEAKER_08]: And so talking about the key actions supporting the development and implementation of an effective elementary mathematics coaching program, which we have in place right now, and develop continued development with our partnership with Lesley University and looking at benchmarking, we will be conducting our second formal walk in January.

143
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:28,705
[SPEAKER_08]: and ensuring that high quality targeted professional development in mathematics is available and conduct school visits again focused on the five core actions which I have presented to you at an earlier time in mathematics.

144
00:27:30,486 --> 00:27:34,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I list the benchmarks there as well.

145
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:42,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, under benchmarks for student learning goal, I have

146
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:57,197
[SPEAKER_08]: put in an ambitious goal of seeing an increase of our students' performance from meeting and exceeding expectations on the state assessment.

147
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,840
[SPEAKER_08]: We currently were at 40.6, hoping to move to 45%.

148
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:12,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see an approximate, that's an increase of approximately 10% of our third through fifth graders.

149
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:13,568
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is my goal.

150
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:26,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will do everything that I can to try to achieve that goal, but it is an ambitious goal to try to see a 10% improvement at that grade span.

151
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:31,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Last goal is my professional practice goal.

152
00:28:31,904 --> 00:28:48,502
[SPEAKER_08]: As I've mentioned before, I am in a training session with the new superintendent induction program, which is to develop skills in strategy development, data analysis, and instructional leadership by completing the first year of the program.

153
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:53,828
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I intend on participating

154
00:28:54,308 --> 00:29:05,361
[SPEAKER_08]: in all eight day-long sessions, completing all assignments, which I have been doing to date, and consulting and meeting with my leadership coach on a monthly basis.

155
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:12,629
[SPEAKER_08]: And the benchmarks will be the documentation from the NIFA program at its completion.

156
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:15,532
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are my goals that I present to the team.

157
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:21,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Edward.

158
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:45,456
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to ask if on the key actions for district improvement, number three, rather than saying by June, if you could say by mid-May, proposed key strategies, because I think it's essential that we have some time to hear the strategies and understand what the budget impact might be.

159
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:48,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make that adjustment.

160
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:57,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Madam Superintendent.

161
00:29:57,138 --> 00:30:02,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really heartened by your section about mathematics.

162
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps it's close to my heart, as you know.

163
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:16,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I would really be interested, if possible, when you do have meetings with Lesley University about scheduling the tutor program, I'd be interested if I could sit in on those meetings or at least be forwarded on that process.

164
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:17,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited.

165
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:22,020
[SPEAKER_04]: about the partnership moving forward, and I think there's a great potential.

166
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be curious to see what they have to think.

167
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

168
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:31,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the report.

169
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:45,675
[SPEAKER_10]: In your benchmark around the MCAS math increase from 40.6 to 45%, was there some kind of rubric that you used to pick that number?

170
00:30:47,353 --> 00:30:53,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so I did work in collaboration with my coach, Dr. Beer, and we discussed the focus.

171
00:30:54,934 --> 00:31:02,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only did, as a district, did we make an investment in having two full-time coaches assigned to the elementary schools.

172
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:15,418
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a 2.0 FTE, and I feel for that kind of investment to have each school receiving coaching two days a week, two full days a week, coaching support.

173
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:21,582
[SPEAKER_08]: that you expect to see an outcome from that investment.

174
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:30,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And so principals, when they are going to look at instruction, they are looking at mathematics instruction.

175
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,913
[SPEAKER_08]: There is extra scrutiny, I feel, that's being given to math.

176
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:43,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Additional support with the planning of mathematics and professional development opportunities that

177
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:51,548
[SPEAKER_08]: teachers have been afforded, that I feel, you know, it is an ambitious goal.

178
00:31:52,489 --> 00:32:01,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what our outcomes will be, but I would like to just push the bar and say, let's go for a 10% increase.

179
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:02,516
[SPEAKER_08]: That is significant.

180
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:07,680
[SPEAKER_08]: But I expect to see improved outcomes.

181
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,224
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my expectation for the investment that we're making and the support that's being given.

182
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:17,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

183
00:32:17,815 --> 00:32:19,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for this.

184
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:24,479
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very nice to have in writing someone's goals and where their focus is going to be.

185
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,402
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's very helpful for the community as a whole.

186
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:33,185
[SPEAKER_15]: They get to hear your voice and what you think the priorities are for your first year.

187
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,647
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to expand a little bit.

188
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:43,172
[SPEAKER_15]: You talk a lot about mathematics, and the reason for that is because when you joined us, you saw that that was the greatest need.

189
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:49,157
[SPEAKER_15]: for our district to focus on for this year, and I just wanted it to be out there that that's why that was chosen.

190
00:32:49,197 --> 00:32:50,298
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't arbitrary.

191
00:32:50,698 --> 00:32:56,841
[SPEAKER_15]: It was based on data in MCAS scores, and that was your assessment at the beginning.

192
00:32:56,881 --> 00:33:06,725
[SPEAKER_15]: And as an instructional leader in your previous job, we felt that we would, you know, focus on that as a committee with you.

193
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:13,068
[SPEAKER_15]: And so just so the community knows, that's why mathematics is highlighted in your goals so directly.

194
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:19,575
[SPEAKER_15]: And in future years, those goals will change as the district needs change.

195
00:33:20,316 --> 00:33:21,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, thank you for your report.

196
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:30,902
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really good to have this, especially when it comes time for us as a committee to do your review.

197
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:36,908
[SPEAKER_15]: we can look back at what your goals were and how you've probably overshot most of them.

198
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:39,429
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my prediction.

199
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:49,034
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have a question about some of the happenings that you had in MedFit, but I'll wave to my colleagues if anybody else had a question.

200
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:52,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Going back...

201
00:33:55,239 --> 00:34:12,372
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a wordsmithing suggestion, and I redid it a couple times, so it got shorter and shorter, but for developing a district-wide focus on instruction, if I could suggest, you might phrase it this way.

202
00:34:12,912 --> 00:34:21,078
[SPEAKER_11]: By working with principals and other district leaders, we will develop a common language about instruction which will be used as the foundation for improving instruction.

203
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:26,953
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that a word or two was left out inadvertently.

204
00:34:30,097 --> 00:34:30,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that.

205
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,464
[SPEAKER_09]: get to sit with you guys.

206
00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:58,890
[SPEAKER_09]: This focus on math is really great and I know as a part of the National Honor Society we're trying to focus on getting our tutoring sessions from just high school as well as some middle schoolers.

207
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,413
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a little bit of complication because we can't leave the high school as a part of the National Honor Society.

208
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:14,680
[SPEAKER_09]: But if there's any way we can get the opportunity to get elementary school kids from 3rd and 5th grade up to the high school, I'm sure that a lot of our students would be willing to help.

209
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:20,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd just love to, on behalf of the National Honor Society, to extend the opportunity to them.

210
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:23,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

211
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:25,147
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate very much that.

212
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:41,403
[SPEAKER_08]: consideration and, you know, we can think very creatively about ways to work with our high school students in supporting our elementary students in their mathematics work.

213
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:43,744
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate that very much.

214
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:47,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

215
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:50,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a couple questions.

216
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:55,732
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that the Medford High School Mall extended their hours until four.

217
00:35:56,607 --> 00:36:11,758
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember before we had the retail shop through the vocational school, that as a PTO parent, I used to open the shop like one or two nights prior to the holidays.

218
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:24,808
[SPEAKER_15]: And so parents could come after work, like 6 or 7 at night, and buy MAJS swag for their family members as Christmas gifts.

219
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:28,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if we have time or ability to do that.

220
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:39,817
[SPEAKER_15]: I think even myself would love to get some new gear before it's kind of early in the day to get across many towns from work to there.

221
00:36:40,277 --> 00:36:47,982
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if you could look it into, even if it's just one night, and have it staffed really well.

222
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:50,864
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that I need a lot of stuff.

223
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, do they take credit card?

224
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:57,934
[SPEAKER_15]: or is it cash only, or how they pay for that would be helpful as well.

225
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:01,214
[SPEAKER_15]: They take credit card now?

226
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:01,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

227
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:08,896
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will look into seeing if we can get extended hours, and we'll get it up on the... Website.

228
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:22,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, blogspot and the website so that... And maybe the patch or the local paper, if we put it out there, we can generate... They were here last month evening during our holiday club service, so they were in the front lobby and stuff.

229
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:27,767
[SPEAKER_15]: And my second one is the Key Club.

230
00:37:28,307 --> 00:37:31,147
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that you mentioned that they're doing a canned food drive.

231
00:37:31,227 --> 00:37:34,488
[SPEAKER_15]: But years ago, they used to do caroling throughout the city.

232
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:37,129
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if that's something that they still do.

233
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:41,330
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you could make a donation or a cost.

234
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,410
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you know.

235
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,230
[SPEAKER_15]: And they used to hire them.

236
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:47,991
[SPEAKER_15]: If, say, you were having a holiday party in your house, they would come and carol at your house.

237
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:51,352
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was just wondering if that was still something that they were doing.

238
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:53,332
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a lot of fun.

239
00:37:53,913 --> 00:38:01,214
[SPEAKER_15]: when you had a big family gathering, and you'd have all of Method High's Key Club coming in and singing, and you'd give them hot chocolate and cookies.

240
00:38:02,174 --> 00:38:06,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if anybody's... Could I ask Tony, are you able to speak to that?

241
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:11,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony Zigny, or... Okay.

242
00:38:12,016 --> 00:38:15,977
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can follow up to find out and see if we can get that advertised as well.

243
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:16,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

244
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:17,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

245
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:18,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

246
00:38:18,197 --> 00:38:18,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

247
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:22,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to accept the superintendent's oath... So motioned.

248
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:26,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

249
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:29,080
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

250
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

251
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:30,844
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

252
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:31,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

253
00:38:31,485 --> 00:38:33,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

254
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Report on MASC conference.

255
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:35,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

256
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:36,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Vanden Heuvel.

257
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:56,664
[SPEAKER_11]: So just a quick update, as you know, the MASC hosted the annual joint school committee superintendent conference from November 7th to 10th in Hyannis, Massachusetts, representing Medford were myself, member Paul Rousseau, and our associate superintendent Diane Caldwell.

258
00:38:57,644 --> 00:39:03,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Throughout the conference, we attended numerous presentations and events, including the update from the Department of Education

259
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:13,120
[SPEAKER_11]: a presentation involving all stakeholders, school law and legal updates, a presentation on the new super induction program, and many others.

260
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:19,764
[SPEAKER_11]: I myself was particularly pleased to have the opportunity to hear the new Commissioner of Education, Jeff Riley, speak.

261
00:39:20,285 --> 00:39:24,928
[SPEAKER_11]: He felt like a breath of fresh air and it sounded to me like he would be more concerned with the whole child

262
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:28,225
[SPEAKER_11]: and will take a more measured approach to standardized testing.

263
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:47,098
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the first opportunity that I had to hear the Commissioner, and I'm hoping that we might set up to invite him to Medford to see some of our wonderful programs, completely like I thought about the CCSR or some of our early child programs.

264
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:54,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to get the Commissioner here, and it was really wonderful to hear him

265
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,471
[SPEAKER_11]: He truly was a breath of fresh air.

266
00:39:57,532 --> 00:40:07,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Another highlight of the conference was the Thursday morning keynote speaker, Mark Brackett, PhD, a founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and professor in the Child Study Center at Yale University.

267
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:18,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Brackett explained his RULER approach, an acronym for the five key emotion skills of recognizing, understanding, labeling, expressing, and regulating emotions.

268
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:23,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And I referred to him at our last meeting when we were talking about social-emotional learning issues

269
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:30,955
[SPEAKER_11]: He is going to have some work that we might want to participate in.

270
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:37,199
[SPEAKER_11]: He was very, very inspirational, and so truly a highlight of the conference.

271
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:45,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Lastly, I myself facilitated the Division II meeting, which is our geographic region for MASC.

272
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:49,168
[SPEAKER_11]: We re-elected Stacey Rizzo from Revere to lead the division.

273
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:52,710
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a wonderful, active school committee member in Revere.

274
00:40:54,093 --> 00:41:10,061
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, I think that the MASC conference is always a way to connect with fellow school committee members from across the Commonwealth and gain an understanding that what we are dealing with here in Medford and issues that are important to us are also important to our fellow school committee members.

275
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:17,545
[SPEAKER_11]: It provides an opportunity to get a much broader view than just simply, you know, in our local community.

276
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like our Director of Fine Arts, Mr. Tony Zigny, to please come forward.

277
00:41:49,031 --> 00:41:50,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, good to be here.

278
00:41:50,252 --> 00:41:52,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very pleased that

279
00:41:53,190 --> 00:42:03,533
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had two Medford High School students selected to perform in this year's prestigious Massachusetts Music Educators Association Northeast District Senior Festival Concert.

280
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:20,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were among more than 1,000 students from across Northeastern Massachusetts who auditioned for the event on Saturday, November 17th at North Andover High School, with only 40% of those who auditioned selected to participate.

281
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:36,745
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second year in a row both of them have been selected to the senior festival and they'll rehearse and perform on the guest conductors at the festival concert and that'll be held at the Galvin Middle School in Wakefield on January 12th, 2019.

282
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:50,271
[SPEAKER_00]: And selected to the festival were senior Christopher Walsh on mallet percussion who was accepted to the festival percussion ensemble.

283
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:57,316
[SPEAKER_00]: and Senior Arden Ingersoll, accepted to the Festival Orchestra and String Base with all-state recommendation.

284
00:43:07,403 --> 00:43:11,326
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to invite Mr. Walsh and Mr. Ingersoll up to receive commendations.

285
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:22,669
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Arden Ingersoll for being accepted to the Festival Orchestra.

286
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:35,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Christopher Walsh for being accepted to the Festival Percussion Ensemble.

287
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:36,473
Nice job!

288
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:42,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Great work.

289
00:43:43,168 --> 00:43:49,050
[SPEAKER_02]: For anyone that's seen the band play at Hormel Stadium predominantly, they're just fabulous.

290
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:55,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did an amazing job, as the superintendent just mentioned, at the pep rally just a couple of weeks ago.

291
00:43:56,172 --> 00:43:56,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So wonderful.

292
00:43:56,872 --> 00:43:58,293
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a great part of our community.

293
00:43:58,393 --> 00:43:59,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, you two.

294
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:18,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that being said, we have a grand announcement for the Medford High School band.

295
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:18,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Ms.

296
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:22,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Rello would like to come up and be the proud reporter of this information.

297
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:24,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

298
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:24,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Rello.

299
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:27,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

300
00:44:28,662 --> 00:44:37,989
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Medford Mustang Marching Band has been invited to participate in December of 2020, so two years from this week.

301
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:43,820
[SPEAKER_05]: to participate in the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II.

302
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:57,294
[SPEAKER_05]: The peace treaty was signed in Pearl Harbor and they are inviting one marching band from every state to participate in a History Channel and A&E Network sponsored event where they're going to have a lot of events.

303
00:44:58,803 --> 00:45:04,948
[SPEAKER_05]: things for the bands to participate in, they're going to have documentaries, and they're going to unveil new museum exhibits for the students.

304
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:12,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have been chosen on behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to represent Massachusetts.

305
00:45:13,216 --> 00:45:14,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We are very excited.

306
00:45:14,197 --> 00:45:19,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So not only are we representing Medford, but we're also representing Massachusetts, which is a really big deal because we are very far from Hawaii.

307
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,620
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of an honor to go.

308
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:30,643
[SPEAKER_05]: The only other band in our area from Massachusetts that's ever made it out to Hawaii for a trip is Danvers High School in, I believe, 2001.

309
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:34,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't get out there very often.

310
00:45:34,224 --> 00:45:36,644
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's nice to get out there and represent Massachusetts.

311
00:45:36,744 --> 00:45:41,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will be doing a whole bunch of events and community service.

312
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:47,227
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be performing in the Pearl Harbor Day Parade as part of the ceremony.

313
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:50,068
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll also be performing on the deck of the USS Missouri.

314
00:45:50,612 --> 00:45:52,774
[SPEAKER_05]: which is still stationed in the water, which is nice.

315
00:45:53,094 --> 00:46:05,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll be able to do a wreath ceremony at that performance where we can honor the 224 residents of Medford that passed away and lost their life in World War II.

316
00:46:05,884 --> 00:46:07,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be able to do a wreath ceremony on that.

317
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,147
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be able to honor the city of Medford.

318
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:10,748
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be able to perform there.

319
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:15,972
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be able to perform at the International Marketplace and for a whole bunch of

320
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:20,072
[SPEAKER_05]: different organizations, and we'll also be able to perform in the parade.

321
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:25,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a bunch of performance opportunities, as well as educational documentaries and presentations.

322
00:46:26,154 --> 00:46:28,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're really looking forward to it.

323
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:30,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Who has questions?

324
00:46:30,795 --> 00:46:31,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wants to go?

325
00:46:31,575 --> 00:46:35,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for representing not only Medford, but Massachusetts on that day.

326
00:46:36,037 --> 00:46:37,337
[SPEAKER_02]: What a phenomenal opportunity.

327
00:46:37,477 --> 00:46:38,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a very special event.

328
00:46:39,058 --> 00:46:45,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So the timing is kind of crazy, but we're really excited about having some time, hopefully in the next few years,

329
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,822
[SPEAKER_05]: and get ready for it.

330
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:49,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

331
00:46:49,482 --> 00:46:50,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Congrats.

332
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto.

333
00:46:52,285 --> 00:46:52,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

334
00:46:52,805 --> 00:46:59,731
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I want to congratulate you and everybody that made it possible, the parents, the band members.

335
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:03,634
[SPEAKER_15]: You've really grown this program since the day you started.

336
00:47:03,674 --> 00:47:06,716
[SPEAKER_15]: You hit the ground running and you've done a tremendous job.

337
00:47:07,197 --> 00:47:09,498
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to congratulate you personally on that.

338
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:14,296
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

339
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:19,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I also read through your packet, and I'm ready to approve this.

340
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:30,325
[SPEAKER_15]: There's only one issue that I saw with it, and I spoke to you directly about it, is a few years ago, the school committee made it mandatory that all students take out the insurance when they're traveling.

341
00:47:30,645 --> 00:47:38,310
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you make that change in this, I motion to approve it and volunteer to go if an extra

342
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:40,884
[SPEAKER_15]: person is needed.

343
00:47:41,164 --> 00:47:43,005
[SPEAKER_15]: So remember, I was first.

344
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:57,571
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that needs to be included.

345
00:47:57,652 --> 00:47:58,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It absolutely can be included.

346
00:47:58,872 --> 00:47:59,973
[SPEAKER_05]: There's already a policy in place.

347
00:48:00,673 --> 00:48:02,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to call the company and have them tack it on to her.

348
00:48:03,902 --> 00:48:05,183
[SPEAKER_13]: our package.

349
00:48:05,403 --> 00:48:06,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course.

350
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,881
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a very exciting opportunity for the band.

351
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:41,502
[SPEAKER_11]: And Haley, it's just been so thrilling to watch the band get better and better with every performance.

352
00:48:42,142 --> 00:48:44,823
[SPEAKER_11]: The pep rally was just great.

353
00:48:44,863 --> 00:48:47,263
[SPEAKER_11]: The performances were just terrific.

354
00:48:48,304 --> 00:48:56,706
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really need to congratulate you and every member because those kids, they're working hard and they're having a great deal of fun and you can see it on their faces.

355
00:48:57,146 --> 00:48:58,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you so much.

356
00:49:02,175 --> 00:49:08,899
[SPEAKER_10]: So I, who doesn't love Hawaii, in December especially.

357
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:23,308
[SPEAKER_10]: But my question is, the dates, the 4th through the 9th, if a family went, do the kids have to come home with the rest of the group?

358
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:26,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Or can we make it?

359
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,511
[SPEAKER_05]: We have different policies on that.

360
00:49:29,912 --> 00:49:31,213
[SPEAKER_05]: With our Disney trip, we did in April.

361
00:49:32,645 --> 00:49:35,006
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens is you can sign your student over.

362
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:42,870
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the travel agent that we worked with for the Florida trip, we had a few parents because it was vacation, they wanted to stay a little bit longer.

363
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:50,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So you actually sign your student out of my care and into your care and we do like a pass off and transition them to their parents.

364
00:49:50,513 --> 00:49:55,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And from that point on in the trip, even if we were still there, they were their parents' responsibility.

365
00:49:55,255 --> 00:49:57,156
[SPEAKER_05]: They stayed with their parents and no longer stayed with the group.

366
00:49:57,216 --> 00:49:59,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is an option to do that, of course.

367
00:50:01,475 --> 00:50:03,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you meant you wanted to leave some of the students in Hawaii.

368
00:50:05,498 --> 00:50:08,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is a really great event.

369
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:11,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just so proud, Marcie, for being selected.

370
00:50:11,183 --> 00:50:14,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just curious, was there some sort of competition?

371
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,648
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't, but it was a pretty long process.

372
00:50:18,668 --> 00:50:19,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I applied about two years ago.

373
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:26,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I applied to a lot of things that come across my way, just because you never know what opportunities it will hold for the kids.

374
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:29,478
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had to send an audition tape in.

375
00:50:29,658 --> 00:50:30,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't this year's band.

376
00:50:31,018 --> 00:50:32,238
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a band two years ago.

377
00:50:33,299 --> 00:50:34,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And we submitted some audition tapes.

378
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:41,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I filled out some forms, did some paperwork, wrote an essay on why we think Medford would be interested in representing the Commonwealth.

379
00:50:41,781 --> 00:50:43,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were selected.

380
00:50:43,482 --> 00:50:47,783
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be just so wonderful if you guys could put together a little YouTube video or something.

381
00:50:47,843 --> 00:50:50,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we're planning on documenting the whole trip if it happens.

382
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:53,844
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would like to reach out to the community.

383
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:55,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we come back, we're

384
00:50:56,201 --> 00:50:59,442
[SPEAKER_05]: going to record all the performances and the different events, take pictures.

385
00:50:59,863 --> 00:51:17,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping to do a free public presentation that we could do at the high school and do a slide show and have the students get up and talk about what they learned, what they saw, what they experienced, and just do a little free night where we could open it up to everybody and show them what we did.

386
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:24,393
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can make one small suggestion, I know a number of Medford residents at the senior center served at World War II.

387
00:51:24,853 --> 00:51:28,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be really, really great if you guys could come down and talk to them about the whole process.

388
00:51:28,955 --> 00:51:30,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe even get some donation money.

389
00:51:30,096 --> 00:51:33,178
[SPEAKER_05]: We would like to reach out to a lot of people in the area.

390
00:51:33,238 --> 00:51:35,159
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's on my list for the next two years.

391
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot ahead of me.

392
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's so wonderful.

393
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

394
00:51:38,401 --> 00:51:38,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.

395
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:46,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I wanted to say congratulations to the entire band and you.

396
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,546
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just incredible.

397
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:48,746
[SPEAKER_01]: It's truly an honor.

398
00:51:48,846 --> 00:51:51,288
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Erin said and Paul said,

399
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:53,142
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to go too.

400
00:51:54,282 --> 00:51:56,363
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a long list of people that want to go.

401
00:51:56,383 --> 00:52:01,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been told that anyone that comes with us can be part of the ceremony on the USS Missouri.

402
00:52:01,606 --> 00:52:05,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anyone would like to come and be part of that, just let me know.

403
00:52:05,628 --> 00:52:06,788
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a friends and family package.

404
00:52:06,808 --> 00:52:11,130
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a giant group.

405
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:11,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

406
00:52:18,038 --> 00:52:21,659
[SPEAKER_07]: My mama will owe $20,000 in two years.

407
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:22,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

408
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:22,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Frello.

409
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:23,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

410
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:28,920
[SPEAKER_07]: So will middle schoolers be, so right in two years I'll have a sophomore, freshman, and seventh grader.

411
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Will middle schoolers be open to the triple?

412
00:52:31,301 --> 00:52:32,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you keep it to strictly?

413
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:35,782
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because Florida, we also brought seventh grade.

414
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,422
[SPEAKER_05]: We also opened up the vocational school.

415
00:52:37,482 --> 00:52:39,502
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not really like the Medford High School band.

416
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:43,463
[SPEAKER_05]: We call ourselves the Medford Mustang Marching Band because there's lots of students involved.

417
00:52:44,548 --> 00:52:47,249
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they're over a certain age, they're allowed to attend.

418
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:49,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So seventh grade and up usually is fine.

419
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:50,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

420
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:52,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the parents have to sign off on everything.

421
00:52:53,052 --> 00:52:58,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So as long as they understand the rules, they're placed in rooms with children of their own age and everything.

422
00:52:58,654 --> 00:52:58,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

423
00:52:59,015 --> 00:53:06,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just in regards to looking two years out, so will you somehow try to reach out to current

424
00:53:07,322 --> 00:53:08,183
[SPEAKER_07]: 5th and 6th graders?

425
00:53:08,203 --> 00:53:15,429
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping in December to have a parent meeting to look at the current 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th graders that we have.

426
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:24,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as our 5th and 6th grade move into 7th and 8th grade over the next year or two, we can add them into the process.

427
00:53:25,382 --> 00:53:33,247
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe, because that was one of the first questions I asked the travel agency, because most of the band that will be going is not currently in band right now.

428
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:35,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of hard to plan for that.

429
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:38,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have up to a year and a half to change our numbers.

430
00:53:39,671 --> 00:53:47,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we can do is we'll plan, but as long as we have over 40, or 40 is a minimum to start, we can go on the package that they proposed to us.

431
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything over that, we'll lower the price.

432
00:53:51,279 --> 00:53:54,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping to get some more students involved, and we can add them up to a year and a half.

433
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:57,403
[SPEAKER_05]: In the next year and a half, we can add them in.

434
00:54:35,635 --> 00:54:36,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

435
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:47,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

436
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,362
[SPEAKER_03]: So this update is just a follow-up to the original October 1 report.

437
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:58,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on all of the additional research and information from our new data analyst, Kim Miles,

438
00:54:58,627 --> 00:55:08,650
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the finalized count, and she has separated the information for some interesting demographics for your information purpose only.

439
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:17,952
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, just a reminder that these are the student counts that are used for Chapter 70 funding going into the FY20 school year.

440
00:55:17,992 --> 00:55:21,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always a year in arrears in terms of the enrollment and funding the budget.

441
00:55:22,253 --> 00:55:25,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the updated document, and we have successfully

442
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:34,896
[SPEAKER_03]: filed all of our state reports for the student information, the EPIMS, and the SCS mandated reports through DESE.

443
00:55:35,276 --> 00:55:37,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are in good shape as far as that goes.

444
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:41,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

445
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,723
[SPEAKER_10]: So you mentioned this, I think.

446
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:53,848
[SPEAKER_10]: So this report that says there were 77 kindergartners at the Brooks.

447
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Desi's website will not show that for another year.

448
00:55:59,022 --> 00:55:59,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

449
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:01,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

450
00:56:02,423 --> 00:56:07,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So current data is based on last year's enrollment counts, October 1.

451
00:56:07,046 --> 00:56:11,368
[SPEAKER_10]: But this October 1 date is the date Desi uses.

452
00:56:11,988 --> 00:56:12,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

453
00:56:12,428 --> 00:56:13,549
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the snapshot.

454
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:18,571
[SPEAKER_10]: If enrollment goes way up or down, this is the snapshot that will show up on Desi's website.

455
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:19,471
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

456
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:22,853
[SPEAKER_03]: If we have more students enroll throughout the year,

457
00:56:23,309 --> 00:56:25,630
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're not counted towards our funding.

458
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:35,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always important that we have every child counted for prior to that October 1 snapshot, because that determines our funding.

459
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:36,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

460
00:56:39,175 --> 00:56:39,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

461
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:41,355
[SPEAKER_15]: I only have a couple questions.

462
00:56:43,556 --> 00:56:48,358
[SPEAKER_15]: At the Roberts fourth and fifth grade, there's a significant increase in the amount of students.

463
00:56:49,902 --> 00:57:03,668
[SPEAKER_15]: I realize that part of that is because first year ELL students are sent to the Brooks and then they have the right to come back to the Roberts.

464
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:04,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct?

465
00:57:04,348 --> 00:57:07,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that how it's working, Diane?

466
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:11,691
[SPEAKER_12]: They do have the right to go back, but that's really not why.

467
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:14,132
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a bubble that year.

468
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:17,113
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a great number of kindergarteners and first graders.

469
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:21,624
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the bubble is in grades four and five right now.

470
00:57:22,184 --> 00:57:27,047
[SPEAKER_12]: So next year, we'll just have five grade fives, because we have five grade fours and five grade fives this year.

471
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:31,689
[SPEAKER_15]: So those numbers won't be as high for fourth grade next year?

472
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:31,749
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

473
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:34,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Just fifth grade will continue to be high and they'll move out?

474
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:35,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, they'll be followed in the middle schools.

475
00:57:35,691 --> 00:57:35,791
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

476
00:57:35,972 --> 00:57:37,973
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just curious if that was the case or not.

477
00:57:38,433 --> 00:57:39,713
[SPEAKER_15]: That was my first question.

478
00:57:40,114 --> 00:57:43,636
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my other question is, thank you for breaking it down by subgroups.

479
00:57:43,676 --> 00:57:46,317
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really good for us to see.

480
00:57:48,091 --> 00:57:51,232
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's a snapshot of the district and what we're looking at.

481
00:57:51,993 --> 00:58:00,017
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just one thing I was hoping that we could also know is like how many homeless families and students we have in the district.

482
00:58:00,598 --> 00:58:02,579
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you have that count.

483
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:06,441
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, especially this time of year, I'm very aware of it.

484
00:58:06,981 --> 00:58:16,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I take care of the homeless families for another district, so I'm well aware that a lot more people recently in the district I work at

485
00:58:17,246 --> 00:58:26,534
[SPEAKER_15]: have become homeless, and I was just wondering where we are in Medford and how many families and where they're sheltering them, if we know that information.

486
00:58:26,994 --> 00:58:28,415
[SPEAKER_15]: And it doesn't have to be tonight.

487
00:58:28,936 --> 00:58:36,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just curious just to have a snapshot of our district and the needs of the people in our community.

488
00:58:38,003 --> 00:58:41,466
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could get that at a later date, that would be great.

489
00:58:42,525 --> 00:58:47,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as a follow-up, we can only provide information on our students, not the families.

490
00:58:48,428 --> 00:58:53,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's based on, you know, account for students.

491
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:54,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's fine.

492
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:57,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Oshiro.

493
00:58:58,673 --> 00:58:59,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you for this report.

494
00:58:59,974 --> 00:59:02,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I also really enjoyed the breakdowns.

495
00:59:02,415 --> 00:59:08,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really curious, though, when I originally read this, about the ratio of special education students in pre-K.

496
00:59:10,143 --> 00:59:13,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like that's a pretty big chunk of the population, or is that a normal?

497
00:59:14,907 --> 00:59:22,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, the male to female ratio seemed a little different, or am I reading the report wrong?

498
00:59:22,734 --> 00:59:29,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I don't know in terms of actual special education numbers and figures and percentages.

499
00:59:29,659 --> 00:59:32,382
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just our data, our demographics.

500
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:48,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Regarding our pre-K programs, the majority of the programs are in place because they develop as a special education program, and then community children are invited to come in on a tuition basis.

501
00:59:48,812 --> 00:59:49,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

502
00:59:49,893 --> 01:00:02,801
[SPEAKER_06]: So we maintain a 50% ratio, so we always need 50% or fewer, 50% or more, of typically developing children in the classroom for it to be an integrated pre-K classroom.

503
01:00:03,482 --> 01:00:06,724
[SPEAKER_06]: So all except for the McGlynn,

504
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,312
[SPEAKER_06]: the Midland Pre-K come under special education.

505
01:00:10,832 --> 01:00:11,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

506
01:00:11,613 --> 01:00:12,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

507
01:00:12,213 --> 01:00:13,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why they're so close in numbers.

508
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:19,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that mandated by the state or is that via funding issue or is that just our policy in general?

509
01:00:19,278 --> 01:00:26,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So we develop Pre-K programs based on our student numbers, special education student numbers, and the need to increase or open up new classrooms.

510
01:00:26,785 --> 01:00:29,687
[SPEAKER_06]: And each time we open a new classroom, that opens up new community seats.

511
01:00:31,008 --> 01:00:31,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

512
01:00:31,709 --> 01:00:36,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And currently there are still, if anyone is looking for a community seat, we still have some openings.

513
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:48,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anyone in the community is interested in having their child attend a pre-K classroom here in Medford, we have part day programs, full day programs, couple days a week programs.

514
01:00:48,442 --> 01:00:50,704
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a variety or a range of options available.

515
01:00:51,104 --> 01:00:51,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

516
01:00:56,918 --> 01:01:03,779
[SPEAKER_06]: We will take a three-year-old who is independent enough to manage in a pre-K classroom.

517
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:05,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you so much.

518
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:20,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Burke, just as a follow-up, both my children were members of those classrooms many years ago, because they're 27 and 25 now, and both learned an exceptional amount.

519
01:01:20,863 --> 01:01:22,003
[SPEAKER_15]: They still remember

520
01:01:23,215 --> 01:01:27,004
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of the things that they did on a daily basis in that program.

521
01:01:27,024 --> 01:01:32,697
[SPEAKER_15]: And it really enhanced, they were the model students, they were the typical developing students.

522
01:01:33,302 --> 01:01:36,403
[SPEAKER_15]: that they called them all the students back then.

523
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:43,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to mention that back in 1990, my child was a student in a MEEP classroom as a model student.

524
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:46,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how long we've had our program here in Medford.

525
01:01:47,065 --> 01:01:48,725
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a tremendous program.

526
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:57,667
[SPEAKER_15]: So anybody listening that has a child, it's a great opportunity.

527
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:01,448
[SPEAKER_15]: The tuition is not expensive, or it wasn't.

528
01:02:03,107 --> 01:02:12,815
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a really, really wonderful way for your child to develop and grow within the district.

529
01:02:12,835 --> 01:02:14,797
[SPEAKER_15]: And it helps them prepare for school.

530
01:02:15,437 --> 01:02:17,018
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of fun.

531
01:02:17,219 --> 01:02:18,079
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot, a lot of fun.

532
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:21,862
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that some of those teachers are still there.

533
01:02:21,882 --> 01:02:23,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Mr. Russo.

534
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:23,724
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

535
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:23,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

536
01:02:25,665 --> 01:02:26,306
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

537
01:02:26,646 --> 01:02:27,847
Motion passes.

538
01:02:33,874 --> 01:02:34,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

539
01:02:34,735 --> 01:02:45,543
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, again, just the summary for the closeout of the prior fiscal year, indicating that we had $56,431,000 that was identified as the appropriation budget and an additional $2,071,107 earmarked from outside revenue sources that

540
01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:59,552
[SPEAKER_03]: equaled a total budget of $58,502,107.

541
01:02:59,592 --> 01:03:01,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So that gave us the spending capacity, according to our budget, of the $58,502,107.

542
01:03:01,673 --> 01:03:04,836
[SPEAKER_03]: We did need to offset revenues by the amount of $1,927,223.

543
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:33,830
[SPEAKER_03]: which gave us $143,884 of that offset that we did not have to utilize going towards our total budget, if you will, to cover items within the general fund.

544
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:41,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So the balance of any of the revenues was used to clear deficits within the revolving funds, such as athletics, and this is a program

545
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,702
[SPEAKER_03]: that is known to be in a deficit.

546
01:03:44,762 --> 01:03:50,946
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have enough collections of or that the fee structure is limited.

547
01:03:51,086 --> 01:03:54,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And so our athletic programs are very popular.

548
01:03:55,389 --> 01:04:02,213
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we don't have an excessive amount charged in order to subsidize these programs.

549
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:11,960
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just have to know as a district that this area is routinely needing to be covered and that

550
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:18,657
[SPEAKER_03]: has to be covered by the general fund revenue in order for us to close out.

551
01:04:19,718 --> 01:04:32,347
[SPEAKER_03]: The areas that were identified through savings, just some examples was within the ELL department and those were paid within the school program codes and that's reporting distinctions for end of year report.

552
01:04:32,907 --> 01:04:34,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, my reporting

553
01:04:34,843 --> 01:04:41,670
[SPEAKER_03]: is based on the function codes program areas by school and by department.

554
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:44,092
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to break those out accordingly.

555
01:04:44,693 --> 01:04:51,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Special education transportation within the general fund, that came in lower than the original encumbrances that we had thought.

556
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:55,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we were able to liquidate at the end of the year, we did have some savings.

557
01:04:56,464 --> 01:04:58,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Vocational out-of-district tuitions,

558
01:04:58,756 --> 01:05:07,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we had fewer students attending the Minuteman and Essex programs, so the applicable transportation was also lower than expected.

559
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:18,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Buildings and grounds, we had the utility usage for heating, natural gas, and phone service had favorable contract rates, and therefore, lower utilization.

560
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:27,028
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have some savings in those program areas that were able to balance the overall budget in its entirety.

561
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:49,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the end of the, as we closed out the fiscal year and reconciled, we have the amounts that were identified and the closeout that we offset from revenue within the after school programs, the before school programs, the MEEP, the SURE and special ed tuitions, circuit breaker amounts, transportation reimbursements from the homeless,

562
01:05:50,455 --> 01:06:00,638
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as vocational tuitions, tri-tech funding, which is going away, and any of the building facility rentals that we were able to utilize for those purposes.

563
01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:13,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also included a summary report of the revolving fund balances at the end so that you have the information in terms of where those programs landed as well.

564
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:19,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

565
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:27,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the report, and thank you for adding the revolving amounts, because I probably would have asked for it.

566
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:32,352
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had a question to start off with.

567
01:06:32,512 --> 01:06:41,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the beginning balances for all of those programs, the ME program and the after school, before school, they all started with the negative balance?

568
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:42,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

569
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is financial accounting.

570
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:48,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to manipulate the report, so I added some little

571
01:06:48,821 --> 01:07:01,424
[SPEAKER_03]: notations at the top to let you know that these were a particular column is an expenditure, a revenue, and if it had a negative amount or parentheses, that's a positive ending balance.

572
01:07:01,464 --> 01:07:16,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So the amounts coming in were positive balances minus the expenditures, adding in the revenues, and then any offsetting amounts that we charged back gave us the positive ending balances that you see there for the FY18 column.

573
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:29,437
[SPEAKER_15]: In future, could you give us the balance on that amount, like the total on that column?

574
01:07:31,157 --> 01:07:31,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

575
01:07:31,938 --> 01:07:32,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

576
01:07:34,298 --> 01:07:34,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, OK.

577
01:07:36,618 --> 01:07:40,399
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just so we can just see it nice and easy, and it's right there.

578
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:44,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, please.

579
01:07:45,475 --> 01:07:46,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

580
01:07:47,056 --> 01:07:50,939
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we can just look at big picture and then it's a little easier.

581
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:58,805
[SPEAKER_15]: So the only question I had is, another question I had actually is page three of nine.

582
01:07:59,626 --> 01:08:11,655
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it was like, under elementary schools, the last four items, did those schools not use all of their

583
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:37,738
[SPEAKER_15]: textbooks allocated fee allocated amounts or that's correct so whatever was expensed is what was utilized and any balances were what was remaining from the allocation provided I just wanted I just saw two things last year is that towards the end of the school year some principals when they came forward hadn't

584
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:41,418
[SPEAKER_15]: and purchase requests for things soon enough.

585
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:52,880
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to make sure that we work with them this year to make sure that they're aware to start pre-ordering in time before the accounting department needs to close out their books.

586
01:08:53,321 --> 01:08:53,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

587
01:08:53,861 --> 01:09:01,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did provide training for all of the principals and their support staff so they do have access to their segment of the budget.

588
01:09:01,782 --> 01:09:07,563
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, the intent is that for these items, especially textbooks, that those are purchased early in the year.

589
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:14,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, you wouldn't need that in April or May, the year's almost over at that point.

590
01:09:14,306 --> 01:09:24,888
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are encouraging all of the principals to monitor and review their requirements and to put in those purchases as they're needed up front.

591
01:09:25,588 --> 01:09:28,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and my last thing is the athletics department.

592
01:09:28,869 --> 01:09:32,630
[SPEAKER_15]: And I understand the need, and by no means do we want to change anything.

593
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:33,890
[SPEAKER_15]: We have great programming.

594
01:09:35,935 --> 01:09:41,938
[SPEAKER_15]: a wide range, a variety of things that all our students have taken advantage of.

595
01:09:42,999 --> 01:09:57,566
[SPEAKER_15]: But I thought when we did the budget, we raised their pre-budgeted amount so that way it would reflect on what the need was so we weren't going to be at the end of the year doing this again.

596
01:09:58,126 --> 01:10:00,547
[SPEAKER_03]: We increased for FY19.

597
01:10:02,526 --> 01:10:08,589
[SPEAKER_03]: So 18 is still, and again, we didn't increase to where the ultimate need is.

598
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,351
[SPEAKER_03]: We're incrementally increasing.

599
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:15,393
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still offsetting with the revolving account where we can.

600
01:10:15,914 --> 01:10:24,458
[SPEAKER_03]: But the usage, and when the teams are successful, there's additional transportation, there's additional officials fees.

601
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:30,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So on a given year, it's, even though we try to project and budget accordingly,

602
01:10:31,508 --> 01:10:36,091
[SPEAKER_03]: the successful teams will drive those figures up even further.

603
01:10:37,092 --> 01:10:38,653
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but that's a good thing.

604
01:10:39,754 --> 01:10:41,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Can't win for winning, right?

605
01:10:42,056 --> 01:10:42,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no.

606
01:10:43,337 --> 01:10:44,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's great.

607
01:10:44,317 --> 01:10:57,647
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to keep moving forward for that because it makes it look like we're not funding it well and I would rather be proactive than reactive with that because I don't want to cut anything and I don't want people to think, oh,

608
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:00,890
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, it's over budget all the time.

609
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,932
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to budget it well.

610
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:04,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

611
01:11:04,154 --> 01:11:06,796
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate the answers.

612
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:09,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the report.

613
01:11:11,081 --> 01:11:17,748
[SPEAKER_10]: You specifically mentioned the revolving counts of athletics, and so that made me look in here for the athletics.

614
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:19,891
[SPEAKER_10]: But on the summary,

615
01:11:21,161 --> 01:11:24,583
[SPEAKER_10]: School athletics had a shredding balance of negative $21.

616
01:11:25,404 --> 01:11:26,405
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm confused.

617
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:28,306
[SPEAKER_03]: So it came in with a positive $21.

618
01:11:28,966 --> 01:11:33,630
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our receipts and the expenditures that we charged off.

619
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:36,171
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, this program was in a deficit.

620
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:37,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to cover it.

621
01:11:37,432 --> 01:11:39,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a positive $0.03.

622
01:11:39,974 --> 01:11:43,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't go negative in a revolving account.

623
01:11:43,696 --> 01:11:46,038
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had just enough to reflect a positive account.

624
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:50,481
[SPEAKER_03]: But this category in particular runs in a deficit.

625
01:11:51,288 --> 01:11:59,052
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe, is there a column missing that tells us how much we are taking from the pile of money?

626
01:12:00,592 --> 01:12:03,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the summary is what was provided.

627
01:12:03,473 --> 01:12:13,738
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of making them whole, that's what the offsetting entries do, is to coordinate and make sure that each of the programs aren't in a deficit.

628
01:12:14,218 --> 01:12:18,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have the offsets from expenditures through in the revenue piece.

629
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,201
[SPEAKER_10]: But it says $21.

630
01:12:20,928 --> 01:12:21,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

631
01:12:21,589 --> 01:12:24,852
[SPEAKER_03]: So going from last year, again, covering a deficit.

632
01:12:25,392 --> 01:12:30,477
[SPEAKER_03]: We covered up to $21 and they rolled in, that was the amount.

633
01:12:30,537 --> 01:12:34,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So each year they essentially start from zero.

634
01:12:34,241 --> 01:12:34,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

635
01:12:35,282 --> 01:12:42,589
[SPEAKER_03]: They take in revenues that are not enough to cover what we need to expend for the purpose of athletics.

636
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just add something?

637
01:12:46,841 --> 01:12:47,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

638
01:12:47,341 --> 01:12:54,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Along with the revolving account that collects the student user fees, the budget also has an expense line for athletics.

639
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:57,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Above and beyond what's covered through that.

640
01:12:58,926 --> 01:13:01,767
[SPEAKER_10]: So the debits for athletics, $489,453.

641
01:13:02,568 --> 01:13:06,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just say half a million dollars.

642
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:14,053
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the money spent, but the credits

643
01:13:14,736 --> 01:13:19,000
[SPEAKER_10]: of $489,432, how much of that is from?

644
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,821
[SPEAKER_02]: User fees?

645
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:22,062
[SPEAKER_10]: User fees.

646
01:13:23,063 --> 01:13:26,466
[SPEAKER_10]: So none of that came out of this $1.9 million?

647
01:13:26,526 --> 01:13:32,371
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we have an additional deficit in athletics of $27,000 within the operating budget.

648
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:39,256
[SPEAKER_03]: So in total, our athletics would probably be about $35,000 plus, closer to $40,000 in a deficit across the revolving and

649
01:13:44,338 --> 01:13:47,500
[SPEAKER_03]: the appropriation side for that area.

650
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,001
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

651
01:13:48,581 --> 01:13:50,802
[SPEAKER_10]: But is there any report that shows us that?

652
01:13:50,842 --> 01:14:00,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm looking at school lunch, for instance, which, I mean, $188,000 in balance, which is fabulous.

653
01:14:00,689 --> 01:14:02,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's nice.

654
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:05,833
[SPEAKER_10]: But this report doesn't help me understand.

655
01:14:06,473 --> 01:14:10,216
[SPEAKER_10]: We have all this money that you found.

656
01:14:11,276 --> 01:14:12,097
[SPEAKER_10]: We had savings.

657
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,423
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it's being used to cover all these things.

658
01:14:15,863 --> 01:14:20,348
[SPEAKER_10]: But I can't tell from this report who's getting the money, who's getting coverage.

659
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:22,910
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the operating budget.

660
01:14:23,211 --> 01:14:29,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So the appropriation was about $2 million short of what we needed in order to function.

661
01:14:30,005 --> 01:14:36,088
[SPEAKER_03]: the district the way that the service level that we want for all of the programs that we have.

662
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:43,731
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to utilize these revolving programs is the revenue offset that we are able to achieve that.

663
01:14:44,352 --> 01:14:57,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to utilize the revenues and things that come in against these different programs across to the general fund in order to stay within the parameters of what our appropriation is and what we

664
01:14:59,017 --> 01:15:02,860
[SPEAKER_03]: delivered in terms of what we could offset from our revenue sources.

665
01:15:03,741 --> 01:15:05,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try to get to my actual question.

666
01:15:06,343 --> 01:15:06,484
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

667
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:19,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to understand, are we spending $200 per student for athletics, $30 per students for the band, $2 per student who want to do an academic club?

668
01:15:20,276 --> 01:15:25,100
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's important information because, well, some people think

669
01:15:25,845 --> 01:15:28,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Those other things are as important as athletics.

670
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:38,135
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we have the band endlessly fundraising, the different activities cost different amounts.

671
01:15:38,295 --> 01:15:39,596
[SPEAKER_10]: So it isn't just that.

672
01:15:40,116 --> 01:15:49,324
[SPEAKER_10]: But it would be nice to know that is our budget and our commitment to a per-pupil activity rational?

673
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:53,167
[SPEAKER_10]: But I can't seem to figure out how to get that information.

674
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:59,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you have many programs and many items within a revolving fund.

675
01:15:59,767 --> 01:16:07,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to capture that, we're looking at every program that's ever run during the course of the year.

676
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:11,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So each program may have a different cost value.

677
01:16:12,118 --> 01:16:18,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So each program may, one program may lose in the sense of they didn't collect enough revenue.

678
01:16:18,543 --> 01:16:20,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Another program may do better.

679
01:16:20,975 --> 01:16:27,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how they're able to offset in terms of the program area for their purpose and intent of each of the categories.

680
01:16:27,538 --> 01:16:33,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Even within athletics, football may be more per student than gymnastics, for example.

681
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:33,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

682
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Or soccer.

683
01:16:34,321 --> 01:16:39,763
[SPEAKER_02]: So even within a certain category, there's disparate information per student.

684
01:16:39,783 --> 01:16:39,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

685
01:16:40,323 --> 01:16:49,367
[SPEAKER_10]: But if the gymnastics team has to fundraise, like it's their only job, and the hockey team

686
01:16:50,388 --> 01:16:54,189
[SPEAKER_10]: The football team doesn't have to do anything, because we just write a really big check.

687
01:16:54,689 --> 01:16:55,509
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not fair.

688
01:16:56,369 --> 01:17:04,111
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to get a sense or find some way to say, this is how much it costs to be a soccer player.

689
01:17:05,011 --> 01:17:07,772
[SPEAKER_10]: This is how much fundraising each person has to do.

690
01:17:09,232 --> 01:17:11,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know the whole families and all that other stuff.

691
01:17:11,812 --> 01:17:14,893
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is how much Medford in our budget, from our taxes,

692
01:17:15,457 --> 01:17:29,264
[SPEAKER_10]: is giving each student to be a soccer player so that we can identify what is surely some big inequities here based on which sports are popular, which clubs are popular.

693
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:36,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I've seen some of the fundraising going on, and I'm just like, do these kids get to go to school at all?

694
01:17:36,548 --> 01:17:38,809
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like all they're doing is fundraising.

695
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:49,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can say that there are outside donations for different athletic programs.

696
01:17:49,659 --> 01:17:53,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is fundraising going on that's outside of our coffers.

697
01:17:54,042 --> 01:18:00,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want to make the illusion that we're the only source funding all of these different programs.

698
01:18:00,806 --> 01:18:07,051
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, there will not be a consistent cost factor per student per event.

699
01:18:07,571 --> 01:18:09,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be the same.

700
01:18:09,589 --> 01:18:11,850
[SPEAKER_03]: a band member as a soccer player.

701
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:15,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are going to be totally different dollar values.

702
01:18:15,251 --> 01:18:18,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And even within that own program, it's going to be different.

703
01:18:18,892 --> 01:18:27,135
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking at the band as an example, different instruments have different requirements of cleaning, maintaining, and operating those areas.

704
01:18:27,175 --> 01:18:32,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of providing a student per cost, per pupil item,

705
01:18:34,271 --> 01:18:36,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've also got the overhead within it.

706
01:18:36,352 --> 01:18:41,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of cost factors for each program that the revolving funds carry.

707
01:18:41,653 --> 01:18:57,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though the cost or the charge that we're implementing is a very low cost, there's still the overhead in terms of running that program for staffing, for building usage, for the materials required to run that program.

708
01:18:57,637 --> 01:19:03,378
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of that type of information that's not going to look consistent, it's not going to look

709
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:15,562
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not apples to apples, and they never will be in truest form, because that would be a false statement to say that, well, every athletic function should be the same per pupil cost.

710
01:19:15,582 --> 01:19:16,202
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just not.

711
01:19:16,262 --> 01:19:22,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like the user fees change based on what their actual item is.

712
01:19:23,103 --> 01:19:23,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So they run.

713
01:19:23,944 --> 01:19:28,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm certainly not suggesting that you should have a single consistent user.

714
01:19:29,925 --> 01:19:31,425
[SPEAKER_10]: We shouldn't be budgeting us.

715
01:19:32,203 --> 01:19:36,405
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, some number of dollars per student for activities is not where I'm going at all.

716
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:46,189
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not possible, it seems, to get a sense of, are we being fair, rational, or deliberate in the current model?

717
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:51,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Because people are getting funds from all over the place.

718
01:19:54,673 --> 01:19:57,394
[SPEAKER_10]: But that makes it complicated.

719
01:19:57,594 --> 01:20:00,856
[SPEAKER_10]: But one place they are getting it is in this.

720
01:20:02,322 --> 01:20:03,262
[SPEAKER_10]: part of the budget.

721
01:20:05,203 --> 01:20:22,467
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't affect how well the band raises money in the community, but we certainly should have some sense of, you said that every year the athletics is running a pretty big deficit.

722
01:20:24,307 --> 01:20:27,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And is anybody else running a big deficit that's on this list every year?

723
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:43,393
[SPEAKER_10]: is athletics have 1,000 students and that deficit is rational for 1,000 students versus another group which has eight students.

724
01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:54,758
[SPEAKER_10]: If there was a group that had eight students and they had a $30,000 deficit we covered every year, and then we had another one with 1,000 students and a $30,000 deficit, something's wrong there.

725
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,020
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get a participation level for you for last year.

726
01:20:59,379 --> 01:21:00,580
[SPEAKER_03]: to tie out to these.

727
01:21:01,821 --> 01:21:07,906
[SPEAKER_10]: But some of these also should be showing up in our PTO process we laid down this past year.

728
01:21:07,926 --> 01:21:18,355
[SPEAKER_10]: The band PTO should be doing a report with all the friends of, you know, and that would tell us number of participants, how much did you raise, what did you do with your money.

729
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that's outside the school coffers.

730
01:21:21,597 --> 01:21:25,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not a, they're 501c3 entities.

731
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not going to show up on our

732
01:21:28,123 --> 01:21:29,844
[SPEAKER_03]: documents for financials at all.

733
01:21:30,084 --> 01:21:31,124
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can add them together.

734
01:21:32,444 --> 01:21:35,905
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we wouldn't, because this is, well you can, yes.

735
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:36,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I can add them together.

736
01:21:36,786 --> 01:21:42,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't that the committee that you were on that they had to file?

737
01:21:42,908 --> 01:21:43,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

738
01:21:43,548 --> 01:21:46,389
[SPEAKER_15]: So we will have, be able to see that.

739
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:47,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

740
01:21:47,749 --> 01:21:50,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Once that goes, it was supposed to go into effect in October.

741
01:21:51,617 --> 01:21:58,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they effectively provide those reports, you can see what the donations are going out from those particular entities.

742
01:21:58,951 --> 01:22:01,235
[SPEAKER_03]: All set?

743
01:22:01,756 --> 01:22:02,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all set.

744
01:22:02,838 --> 01:22:03,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Giro?

745
01:22:03,923 --> 01:22:07,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would also like to know participation rates in the different activities.

746
01:22:07,445 --> 01:22:13,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so, obviously, if we have one chess kid and that kid costs a million dollars, like a crazy example.

747
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:16,549
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would tell me a lot more about the program and participation rates.

748
01:22:16,609 --> 01:22:18,570
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do have other questions.

749
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:23,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I was curious about, on page six of nine, about the math teacher allocation.

750
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:26,834
[SPEAKER_04]: In particular, I was interested in the Andrews Middle School.

751
01:22:27,474 --> 01:22:31,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed here that the budget there

752
01:22:31,772 --> 01:22:33,733
[SPEAKER_04]: that we've exceeded the budget significantly.

753
01:22:33,773 --> 01:22:35,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know what the situation was there.

754
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:42,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this would be actual charges for staffing that occurred.

755
01:22:42,197 --> 01:22:50,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So there might have been some additional steps and lanes that that math department was able to achieve during the course of the year.

756
01:22:50,981 --> 01:22:55,643
[SPEAKER_03]: There could have been a change in staffing where somebody came in at a higher rate than what was originally

757
01:22:56,053 --> 01:23:01,155
[SPEAKER_03]: projected within the budget, so there's a number of factors that could impact that.

758
01:23:01,175 --> 01:23:16,501
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seems like, once again, talking about parity at our middle schools, when you have this page six of nine, when you have one school getting almost $120,000 more from math teachers, that's... So, again, it's about replacement.

759
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:22,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Apples to apples, and I understand... Also, I think the numbers are higher at the Andrews, so there could be an extra classroom that was needed.

760
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:27,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the level of the seniority for teaching as well.

761
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a number of factors.

762
01:23:29,753 --> 01:23:33,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that there's an intentional piece here.

763
01:23:33,115 --> 01:23:35,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It's based on who's already in the building.

764
01:23:36,176 --> 01:23:39,558
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just be nice to understand what's happening there.

765
01:23:40,298 --> 01:23:47,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And this question is, I recognize you're very, very busy and you have lots going on, especially at this time of year.

766
01:23:47,842 --> 01:23:51,743
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to know, do we have a sense of different school districts?

767
01:23:52,103 --> 01:23:58,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a report that would be easily found by you?

768
01:23:58,906 --> 01:24:02,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I'm not asking you to cook it up yourself.

769
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:07,749
[SPEAKER_04]: But is there some sort of database of different school systems that have breakdowns as fine?

770
01:24:08,589 --> 01:24:09,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

771
01:24:09,049 --> 01:24:13,270
[SPEAKER_03]: The Department of Ed has the information, and you're able to view that.

772
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:14,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the closeouts and everything?

773
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:17,020
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be really interesting.

774
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it's a question of I'll do the research myself then.

775
01:24:19,602 --> 01:24:28,149
[SPEAKER_04]: But this report itself, when you created it, was this one program that generated all these numbers?

776
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:29,690
[SPEAKER_03]: The financial system.

777
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:30,531
[SPEAKER_03]: The financial system.

778
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:31,652
[SPEAKER_03]: The city's financial system.

779
01:24:31,672 --> 01:24:38,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible that you could create or email us the report when you create this as a machine-readable format?

780
01:24:38,257 --> 01:24:41,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be a little easier for me if I do the district-by-district analysis.

781
01:24:43,861 --> 01:24:51,024
[SPEAKER_03]: The state provides that scenario for you and you can identify which districts you wanted to compare.

782
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:54,525
[SPEAKER_03]: The FY18 data will not be available until next year.

783
01:24:54,765 --> 01:24:58,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's a year in arrears because of the reporting and filing that has to take place.

784
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd be looking at the FY17 data.

785
01:25:02,317 --> 01:25:08,942
[SPEAKER_03]: on the Department of Ed's information that you could compare to other districts in terms of size, locality.

786
01:25:09,983 --> 01:25:14,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a giant burden for you to send us this report as a machine-readable PDF?

787
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:17,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an easy thing where it's just Control-P and it's sent out?

788
01:25:17,789 --> 01:25:21,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the formulas are in there to add up by category.

789
01:25:21,973 --> 01:25:28,618
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to download it, because I've done it, the numbers you can see doesn't have a total button that's like formula.

790
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:30,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd have to re-put in a formula.

791
01:25:31,329 --> 01:25:35,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible that... But I can certainly scan it and send you as a PDF.

792
01:25:36,093 --> 01:25:38,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but then I'll have to code something.

793
01:25:38,135 --> 01:25:41,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be the function of... Right, I can figure it out.

794
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:42,779
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little Python playdough.

795
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:48,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

796
01:25:48,785 --> 01:25:51,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Kreatz, second by Ms.

797
01:25:51,888 --> 01:25:52,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Vandekloot.

798
01:25:52,748 --> 01:25:53,389
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

799
01:25:53,409 --> 01:25:53,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

800
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:54,830
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

801
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:56,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

802
01:25:56,272 --> 01:25:56,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

803
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:01,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Report on PTO registration informational.

804
01:26:02,393 --> 01:26:19,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is dovetailed perfectly into this next topic, where we have identified that the new executive assistant in the superintendent's office will maintain the listing from our PTO organizations, our 501c3 entities.

805
01:26:19,848 --> 01:26:25,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a quick search from the Attorney General's website, and there were 43 that came

806
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:28,852
[SPEAKER_03]: came across with the word Medford in it.

807
01:26:29,353 --> 01:26:32,095
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that's not necessarily all school-based.

808
01:26:32,536 --> 01:26:35,939
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be city items as well.

809
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:44,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a number of ways to search to identify if there's Brooks, Friends of the Brooks, or the individual schools.

810
01:26:45,027 --> 01:26:50,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a number of entities out there that are already functioning as a tax-exempt 501c3.

811
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:59,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be maintaining that listing through the superintendent's office going forward on an annual basis.

812
01:27:00,396 --> 01:27:15,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also been in communication with the Attorney General's office, and they are providing a canned webinar-based training segment that they would like to be rolling out to the Commonwealth.

813
01:27:15,327 --> 01:27:18,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've kind of worked in collaboration.

814
01:27:18,369 --> 01:27:21,772
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a timely partnership, and they are going to be

815
01:27:22,495 --> 01:27:25,337
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully sending this out mid-January.

816
01:27:25,737 --> 01:27:45,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So once I have additional information on that exact timeline, we will be one of the first to receive that training and identify that as citywide as well, not just necessarily school PTOs and 501c3s, but we can impact anybody within the city that's part of these organizations to

817
01:27:46,115 --> 01:27:59,788
[SPEAKER_03]: get better information on the governance of the 501c3s, the processes either to start them up and or to keep them going in terms of the reporting requirements on an annual basis and the financial reports that are going.

818
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:08,120
[SPEAKER_03]: As people have communicated or requested information, again, the best resource is the Attorney General's website.

819
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the nonprofit organization.

820
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:17,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you Google the 501C3 in Massachusetts, it takes you right to their website.

821
01:28:17,242 --> 01:28:28,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a good starting point for initiating that if an organization was looking to formalize their fundraising efforts and be able to really

822
01:28:29,438 --> 01:28:31,919
[SPEAKER_03]: help out and assist on particular programs.

823
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:34,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the status that we have.

824
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:40,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And in January, I hope to be able to share when we will be rolling out that additional training.

825
01:28:41,123 --> 01:28:41,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

826
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:43,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto, a question on this?

827
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:43,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

828
01:28:45,405 --> 01:28:50,767
[SPEAKER_15]: So there was a subcommittee on this last year.

829
01:28:51,227 --> 01:28:52,748
[SPEAKER_15]: My colleagues were on.

830
01:28:53,048 --> 01:28:55,529
[SPEAKER_15]: And we had a presentation by Jenny Graham.

831
01:28:55,569 --> 01:28:58,030
[SPEAKER_15]: She presented this online.

832
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:09,437
[SPEAKER_15]: program that all our PTOs and friends of groups were supposed to start utilizing by October 1st.

833
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:15,660
[SPEAKER_15]: And with the transition of the new superintendent and the administrative team, that deadline hasn't happened.

834
01:29:15,997 --> 01:29:19,218
[SPEAKER_15]: So we already have the form and it's been approved by this committee.

835
01:29:19,298 --> 01:29:28,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to move forward with the date for all our current PTOs and friends of account to start using those.

836
01:29:28,819 --> 01:29:33,000
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would like to see everybody registered by February 1st.

837
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,001
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's a significant amount of time.

838
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:40,362
[SPEAKER_15]: I know with the holidays, it gives them the whole month of January after that to look at it.

839
01:29:40,702 --> 01:29:42,282
[SPEAKER_15]: And they'll be looking at doing their

840
01:29:43,337 --> 01:30:05,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Taxes for the 5013 C. So they'll have the documents right in front of them So I'm making a motion at this point to continue what we voted on for October 1st with to continue that and have all of our groups beyond on that line in facilitated by Emily by by February 1st of 2019 and

841
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:12,003
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion that all PTOs and friends of, go online, Ms.

842
01:30:12,043 --> 01:30:14,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Vandekloot.

843
01:30:14,664 --> 01:30:22,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Is what we developed consistent with, does it make sense to have that happen before we see what the state has in there?

844
01:30:22,505 --> 01:30:24,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make sure it works.

845
01:30:25,306 --> 01:30:32,628
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we have to rely on the entities to self-report as well.

846
01:30:32,888 --> 01:30:34,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if they've got a creative name,

847
01:30:35,269 --> 01:30:41,012
[SPEAKER_03]: that we haven't thought of to search within the AG's search capacity, we're not going to find them.

848
01:30:41,573 --> 01:30:56,302
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's more asking the public and the groups that are already affiliated to self-report to the superintendent's office so we can have an active and more accessible listing of those groups.

849
01:30:56,642 --> 01:31:01,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can certainly put the start out there and provide what we are able to

850
01:31:02,484 --> 01:31:08,251
[SPEAKER_03]: ascertained from the AG's website, but again, it's really self-reporting.

851
01:31:08,932 --> 01:31:13,879
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's no reason not to go ahead, as my colleague suggests, with the form that we developed.

852
01:31:14,559 --> 01:31:20,747
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a simple document to identify the name and their 501c3 tax ID information.

853
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:24,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, it was a little bit more than that.

854
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:28,011
[SPEAKER_15]: They had certain requirements.

855
01:31:28,111 --> 01:31:38,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we should provide, maybe we could ask Jenny Graham to come and present the form to us to refresh us of what's on there, so that way we all see it again, because it was almost a year ago.

856
01:31:38,819 --> 01:31:40,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Or at least to the subcommittee.

857
01:31:40,841 --> 01:31:41,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have it?

858
01:31:44,107 --> 01:32:07,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, and we did make it mandatory at our meeting last year that all groups affiliated with using friends of or PTOs, anything reflecting it was mandatory, it wasn't voluntary for those groups to submit their information, otherwise they weren't allowed to raise funds.

859
01:32:08,242 --> 01:32:10,245
[SPEAKER_15]: using four Method High groups.

860
01:32:10,786 --> 01:32:12,468
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not a voluntary thing.

861
01:32:12,508 --> 01:32:16,473
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to be very clear that any group raising funds for students

862
01:32:16,929 --> 01:32:23,215
[SPEAKER_15]: student activities that, through MEDFED, have mandated to register.

863
01:32:23,695 --> 01:32:25,617
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to be very clear on that.

864
01:32:26,337 --> 01:32:29,020
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

865
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:35,926
