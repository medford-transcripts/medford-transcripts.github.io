1
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:17,551
All right.

2
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:23,012
Yeah, I sent.

3
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:25,573
I'm going to go ahead and forward.

4
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,634
It'll be, hold on.

5
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,017
Very quickly forward it to everybody again.

6
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:11,726
Okay.

7
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:14,286
All right.

8
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:14,586
You ready?

9
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:22,668
Okay.

10
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,428
Where's the agenda?

11
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,210
Good evening, everybody.

12
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:38,071
We're gonna get started with Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, September 30th

13
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,027
Mr. Clerk, you need to call the roll.

14
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,051
Yes, when you're ready, please call the roll.

15
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:49,733
Councilor Callahan.

16
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:53,016
Councilor Zaro.

17
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,020
Councilor Scott Pelli.

18
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:02,884
Councilor Singh.

19
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:05,827
And Councilor Lemming.

20
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:10,448
present, four present, one absent.

21
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,048
The meeting is called to order.

22
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:14,329
Two items on the agenda today.

23
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:30,075
The first is the summer newsletter, which I sent out a first draft to everybody last week after summarizing most of the things that we, most of the important agenda items that we discussed over the summer.

24
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:40,400
and just sent out another copy following some of Councilor Lozaro's edits to one of the commemorations and acknowledgements.

25
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:53,388
I'm just going to share my screen really quickly to display the working draft on Overleaf that I got.

26
00:05:57,713 --> 00:05:58,873
All right, can everybody see it?

27
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,034
Is it visible on the screen?

28
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:01,474
All right, good.

29
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:09,237
Right, so if anybody, so yeah, this basically, this is like the summer newsletter.

30
00:06:09,297 --> 00:06:15,920
We didn't meet too consistently over the summer just by sending out the monthly one.

31
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,182
We followed the same pattern last year.

32
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:20,925
This covers the months of June through September 2025.

33
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:31,276
And it touches on the most important points from those meetings, along with links to the YouTube videos and the agenda items themselves.

34
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:32,397
Again,

35
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:41,561
Councilor Lazar already sent in a couple of edits to some factual corrections on the commemoration for National Recovery Month.

36
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:49,849
That being said, do any other councilors have any comments on this?

37
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:50,970
Councilor Sang?

38
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:52,589
One moment.

39
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:53,770
Hold on.

40
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:54,890
Mic on.

41
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,230
OK.

42
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,030
Thank you.

43
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,891
OK.

44
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:06,213
I have four comments as of right now, the first one being for the Scrimeti point.

45
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:13,296
Another part of the resolution was asking for state action.

46
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,056
Wait, sorry.

47
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:14,656
Which point?

48
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:15,916
Scrimeti v. US.

49
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,377
Oh, yeah.

50
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:17,817
Sorry.

51
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:17,997
Yep.

52
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:31,876
I the other part of it was just asking for state action to pass the strongest protection possible protections for transgender people.

53
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:36,840
I think that's kind of important context just because the resolution wasn't just opposing.

54
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:42,844
the Supreme Court decision, which of course is something that we don't have much power over either.

55
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:51,265
But asking for protections for transgender people gives more context and also is something that we have a bit more say in.

56
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:53,126
So that's the first point.

57
00:07:53,246 --> 00:08:01,507
The second point is for the resolution to reduce heavy trucking, I believe we, what have you?

58
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:04,648
It was just to, I was gonna say it too, it's just to move it to

59
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:06,446
We moved it to a committee, right?

60
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:09,087
Public Works, was it?

61
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,247
Or Committee of the Whole?

62
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:11,428
I think so, Public Works.

63
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:12,128
Public Works?

64
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:20,031
I can check the record.

65
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:21,192
Yeah, let's check.

66
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,532
But that's what I recall as well.

67
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:23,533
OK.

68
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:24,873
I don't think it was just a resolution.

69
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,034
We're just passing it.

70
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:27,034
We're passing it on, yeah.

71
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,955
Can you turn your mic on?

72
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:29,115
Sorry?

73
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:33,677
Just turn your mic on to make sure that the mic is on.

74
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:34,197
Yep.

75
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:34,537
Thank you.

76
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:39,853
Let me make sure let me find which committee that went to for you.

77
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:43,539
Um, my third point is the public.

78
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,084
My third and fourth points are public health committee.

79
00:08:49,810 --> 00:09:00,732
Resolution to hold immigration accountable to Medford residents and prepare plans to help dependents of those taken by ICE.

80
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:06,193
I believe that was the meat of ordinance or not ordinance resolution.

81
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:09,093
Wait, was this the police report about ICE activity?

82
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:11,274
No, this is under public health.

83
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:15,275
Great.

84
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:16,555
This one?

85
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:17,355
Yeah, yep.

86
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,608
Okay, and what else would you?

87
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:29,175
I would add and discuss methods to protect dependents of medical residents who've been abducted and or deported.

88
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:42,125
Is that?

89
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:44,266
Yeah.

90
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:44,947
Okay.

91
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,912
Yep, I'll just turn everybody's mic on.

92
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:57,456
I think we can actually remove the section that says hold immigration enforcement accountable.

93
00:09:57,516 --> 00:10:09,523
I think the resolution is mostly about, the resolution touched on Medford's response to when ICE has had

94
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:28,013
actions in Medford and how the community has responded and what we would like to do in an official capacity with helping dependents of people who are taken by ICE, but not in relation to how we respond to ICE.

95
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:30,595
So I think we can take out those few words too.

96
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:34,137
Yeah, I think that's perfect.

97
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:34,717
Okay.

98
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,938
And then I had one more.

99
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:38,379
Yep, Councilor Calhoun.

100
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:40,360
I think the language

101
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:44,290
Around the 8 million from free cash to capitalization is just confusing.

102
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:52,411
It's like we put this in and we pass a lot of, from like, I think it's the only way to be a little better.

103
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:57,412
We moved $8 million from free cash to establish.

104
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:03,594
Yeah.

105
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:07,975
And then we approved $2 million of appropriations.

106
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,235
I'd say we've approved.

107
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,283
For the free cash, can we add the word reserves after free cash, just because it's such a floating concept?

108
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:23,787
Yeah, I do like this, this just showing that movement as a whole.

109
00:11:23,847 --> 00:11:27,610
So I feel like it would help residents to sort of understand the process a little bit more.

110
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,633
But I do I thank you for the wordsmithing.

111
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:31,473
I think it's essential.

112
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:35,857
I'm sorry to bring us back to the public health point.

113
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:43,509
Can we say, after abuptage, can we say and or supported as well?

114
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,972
Just to make it more kind of all inclusive.

115
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:48,273
And then, thank you.

116
00:11:48,493 --> 00:12:03,885
And then for the following bullet point, could we say, in accessing social services after federal government cuts?

117
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:09,364
Thank you.

118
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:11,707
Councilor Kalan.

119
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:12,588
Just that one.

120
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:14,471
You might have already caught it.

121
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:15,933
I just can't read the text up there.

122
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:22,803
But it says we moved 2 million blah, blah, blah of appropriations from the Stabilization Fund appropriations.

123
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,325
So there's two appropriations in there.

124
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:25,307
Just remove one of those.

125
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:38,827
We moved a million for free cash reserves for capital stabilization fund and approved 2.3 million appropriations from stabilization.

126
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:45,290
See how it says appropriations, just get rid of the second one.

127
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:45,570
Sure.

128
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:46,630
Thanks.

129
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:50,232
Okay.

130
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:56,835
Any other points?

131
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:10,264
I have a small, I mean, this is so marginal, but I think for the last three bullet points we passed, I would prefer saying we sent to this committee instead of we passed to this committee.

132
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:14,816
I was just trying to break it up.

133
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:18,299
Like technically all this was in regular meetings, but.

134
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,260
Right, right.

135
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,565
Just because I think past to this committee, if you're reading it past, you might think like we passed something.

136
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:30,789
But saying we sent to this committee means that there's further actions.

137
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:32,790
Sure.

138
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,431
Did we get the heavy trucking one?

139
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:36,633
Yeah, that was the last bit.

140
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:36,973
Justin?

141
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:38,555
Oh, sorry.

142
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:40,456
Did we get the heavy trucking one?

143
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:41,297
You were going to look up

144
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:42,707
Oh, sorry.

145
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:46,710
The other edits took over my mind.

146
00:14:22,782 --> 00:14:22,997
you

147
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,090
Yeah, public works facilities.

148
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:58,536
Yep.

149
00:14:58,996 --> 00:14:59,237
Great.

150
00:14:59,337 --> 00:14:59,717
Thank you.

151
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:00,879
And that would also say set.

152
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:01,720
Yeah.

153
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,332
Okay, so it was sent to public works and facilities?

154
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:24,732
Yes.

155
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:26,474
Cool.

156
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:57,424
I'm actually just gonna...

157
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,219
Okay.

158
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,443
Anybody else have any other edits on this draft?

159
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:03,635
No, I don't have any comments.

160
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:05,196
Do we have any motions?

161
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:16,416
motion to motion to approve and distribute or second on the motion to approve and distribute by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Sang.

162
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,199
Mr. Quirk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

163
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,464
Oh, that's right.

164
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:24,385
All those in favor?

165
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:24,465
Aye.

166
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:25,807
Opposed?

167
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:26,908
Motion passes.

168
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:42,772
The next item on the agenda is the discussion of listening sessions, where we can basically just talk about whatever listening sessions we've attended, what the vibes were, how things went.

169
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:46,414
Councilor, oh wait, no, sorry.

170
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,194
Requested again, I pressed the wrong button.

171
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:54,336
Councilor Lazaro.

172
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:55,677
Thank you.

173
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,384
hosted a listening session at the Senior Center last week, and it was well attended.

174
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:13,409
We always have a listening session, somebody from this committee, monthly, the third Thursday of each month at lunchtime at the Senior Center.

175
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:17,211
We would like to be able to host more

176
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,904
listening sessions and other locations on a regular basis if possible.

177
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:37,980
We have hosted them with different affinity groups at the library and other areas, but the senior center has consistent availability and they always have activities happening so there's always people around.

178
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:38,780
And

179
00:18:40,742 --> 00:18:48,289
I know that there are a couple of people that like to attend a lot because they have a lot of feedback to offer but they're also very keyed into things that are happening in the city.

180
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:58,519
So, people come to me with thoughts about things that they would like to see and also questions so we talked a lot about parking roads.

181
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:06,142
DPW work, and I'm able to bring feedback to City Hall.

182
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:12,985
And one thing I was able to talk with people about is they came to me with some questions about zoning proposals.

183
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:17,267
And since zoning can be very confusing,

184
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:39,618
when you see everything all at once or you just hear things on social media, it's very helpful, I find, to be able to tell people a little bit more simply and directly your understanding of what's happening, maybe exactly where they live or

185
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:43,340
in an area of town that they're curious about.

186
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,602
So I was able to address some questions about that.

187
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:46,702
And that was very nice.

188
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:47,843
We had a really nice time.

189
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:48,543
We ended up meeting.

190
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:55,226
Usually we meet in the cafeteria, but there was a demonstration about soup, which is coming, we're coming on soup season.

191
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:56,587
So that was fun.

192
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:59,408
I missed it though, cause I was doing a listening session.

193
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:04,771
So we had to go to the library instead, which meant that we were in a much more cozy setting.

194
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,273
But yes, it was very, it's always fun.

195
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:16,872
I encourage any seniors the third Thursday of the month to, is it the third or the fourth?

196
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:17,992
Fourth.

197
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:23,294
Fourth Thursday of the month to come to our listening sessions.

198
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:24,994
It's always in the newsletter.

199
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:26,795
So if you follow the newsletter, it's in there.

200
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:34,278
It's often me, it's often Councilor Lemming, it's often sometimes Councilor Callahan, Councilor Svang.

201
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:37,979
But yes, always a good time.

202
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:39,248
Thank you.

203
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,716
Thank you, Councilor.

204
00:20:43,758 --> 00:20:47,568
I also have a confession to make which is that

205
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:57,488
I put a wrong calendar date on my calendar, and I accidentally missed one of the listening sessions over the summer.

206
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:05,554
I came back the next day for another event they're celebrating at the Senior Center, and I also attended the 10 a.m.

207
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,916
Friday morning

208
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:25,306
chat with veterans at the senior center held by the veteran services director, and then a month later I did conscientiously remember to attend a

209
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,154
a session at the senior center, which was a little bit more informal.

210
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:35,778
It wasn't like we were used to just because there were fewer people over the summer.

211
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:40,161
I basically just, there were three tables where people were having their lunch.

212
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:44,204
And so I would just join each group at each different table.

213
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:51,549
And that was much more, the situation there was more people were talking about

214
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:57,430
Pretty typical resident services issues.

215
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:04,923
Trees that were growing too tall in front of people's houses, wanted attention from the

216
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:07,378
from the tree warden about that.

217
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:12,380
Just general questions about goings on in the city.

218
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,101
So that was a, which was, which was nice.

219
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:18,243
It was a, it was a much more relaxed, relaxed environment.

220
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:25,746
So yeah, in summary, I was responsible for two listening sessions these past months.

221
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:31,469
I attended one of them and it was a, it was a pretty, pretty relaxing time.

222
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:34,170
But if any, any other folks would like to

223
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:35,792
take it up in.

224
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:40,895
If any of my colleagues would like to take it up in October, just let me know.

225
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:42,897
1230, end of the month.

226
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:50,201
And yeah, that's all I got.

227
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:54,583
Anybody else have anything to report about folks that they were chatting with around the community?

228
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,206
Cool, thank you.

229
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,007
Any motions on the floor?

230
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,593
Motion to adjourn?

231
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:19,497
On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

232
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:20,297
All those in favor?

233
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:21,078
Aye.

234
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:21,778
Opposed?

235
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:22,898
Motion passes.

236
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:24,259
Meeting is adjourned.

237
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:24,559
Thank you.
