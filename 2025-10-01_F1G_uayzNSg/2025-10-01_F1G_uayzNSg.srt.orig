1
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:17,551
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:23,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I sent.

3
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:25,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and forward.

4
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,634
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be, hold on.

5
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Very quickly forward it to everybody again.

6
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:11,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

7
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:14,286
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

8
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:14,586
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready?

9
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:22,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

10
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the agenda?

11
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everybody.

12
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:38,071
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna get started with Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, September 30th

13
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, you need to call the roll.

14
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, when you're ready, please call the roll.

15
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:49,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

16
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:53,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Zaro.

17
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

18
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:02,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Singh.

19
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:05,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And Councilor Lemming.

20
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:10,448
[SPEAKER_03]: present, four present, one absent.

21
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,048
[SPEAKER_03]: The meeting is called to order.

22
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:14,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Two items on the agenda today.

23
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:30,075
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is the summer newsletter, which I sent out a first draft to everybody last week after summarizing most of the things that we, most of the important agenda items that we discussed over the summer.

24
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:40,400
[SPEAKER_03]: and just sent out another copy following some of Councilor Lozaro's edits to one of the commemorations and acknowledgements.

25
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:53,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to share my screen really quickly to display the working draft on Overleaf that I got.

26
00:05:57,713 --> 00:05:58,873
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, can everybody see it?

27
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it visible on the screen?

28
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:01,474
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, good.

29
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:09,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so if anybody, so yeah, this basically, this is like the summer newsletter.

30
00:06:09,297 --> 00:06:15,920
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't meet too consistently over the summer just by sending out the monthly one.

31
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,182
[SPEAKER_03]: We followed the same pattern last year.

32
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:20,925
[SPEAKER_03]: This covers the months of June through September 2025.

33
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:31,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And it touches on the most important points from those meetings, along with links to the YouTube videos and the agenda items themselves.

34
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:32,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Again,

35
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:41,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lazar already sent in a couple of edits to some factual corrections on the commemoration for National Recovery Month.

36
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:49,849
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, do any other councilors have any comments on this?

37
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:50,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Sang?

38
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:52,589
[SPEAKER_03]: One moment.

39
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:53,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

40
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:54,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Mic on.

41
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,230
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

42
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

43
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,891
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

44
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:06,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I have four comments as of right now, the first one being for the Scrimeti point.

45
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:13,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Another part of the resolution was asking for state action.

46
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, sorry.

47
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:14,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Which point?

48
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:15,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Scrimeti v. US.

49
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

50
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:17,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

51
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:17,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

52
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:31,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I the other part of it was just asking for state action to pass the strongest protection possible protections for transgender people.

53
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:36,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's kind of important context just because the resolution wasn't just opposing.

54
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:42,844
[SPEAKER_04]: the Supreme Court decision, which of course is something that we don't have much power over either.

55
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:51,265
[SPEAKER_04]: But asking for protections for transgender people gives more context and also is something that we have a bit more say in.

56
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:53,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the first point.

57
00:07:53,246 --> 00:08:01,507
[SPEAKER_04]: The second point is for the resolution to reduce heavy trucking, I believe we, what have you?

58
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:04,648
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just to, I was gonna say it too, it's just to move it to

59
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:06,446
[SPEAKER_04]: We moved it to a committee, right?

60
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:09,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Public Works, was it?

61
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Committee of the Whole?

62
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:11,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, Public Works.

63
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:12,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Public Works?

64
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:20,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I can check the record.

65
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:21,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's check.

66
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,532
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what I recall as well.

67
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:23,533
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

68
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:24,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was just a resolution.

69
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,034
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just passing it.

70
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:27,034
[SPEAKER_00]: We're passing it on, yeah.

71
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you turn your mic on?

72
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:29,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry?

73
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:33,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Just turn your mic on to make sure that the mic is on.

74
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:34,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

75
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:34,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

76
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:39,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me make sure let me find which committee that went to for you.

77
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:43,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my third point is the public.

78
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,084
[SPEAKER_04]: My third and fourth points are public health committee.

79
00:08:49,810 --> 00:09:00,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Resolution to hold immigration accountable to Medford residents and prepare plans to help dependents of those taken by ICE.

80
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:06,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that was the meat of ordinance or not ordinance resolution.

81
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:09,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, was this the police report about ICE activity?

82
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:11,274
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is under public health.

83
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:15,275
Great.

84
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:16,555
[SPEAKER_03]: This one?

85
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:17,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yep.

86
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and what else would you?

87
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:29,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I would add and discuss methods to protect dependents of medical residents who've been abducted and or deported.

88
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:42,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that?

89
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:44,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

90
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:44,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

91
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I'll just turn everybody's mic on.

92
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:57,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can actually remove the section that says hold immigration enforcement accountable.

93
00:09:57,516 --> 00:10:09,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the resolution is mostly about, the resolution touched on Medford's response to when ICE has had

94
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:28,013
[SPEAKER_06]: actions in Medford and how the community has responded and what we would like to do in an official capacity with helping dependents of people who are taken by ICE, but not in relation to how we respond to ICE.

95
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:30,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we can take out those few words too.

96
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:34,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's perfect.

97
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:34,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

98
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had one more.

99
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:38,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, Councilor Calhoun.

100
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:40,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the language

101
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:44,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Around the 8 million from free cash to capitalization is just confusing.

102
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:52,411
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we put this in and we pass a lot of, from like, I think it's the only way to be a little better.

103
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:57,412
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved $8 million from free cash to establish.

104
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:03,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

105
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:07,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we approved $2 million of appropriations.

106
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say we've approved.

107
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,283
[SPEAKER_04]: For the free cash, can we add the word reserves after free cash, just because it's such a floating concept?

108
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:23,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do like this, this just showing that movement as a whole.

109
00:11:23,847 --> 00:11:27,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like it would help residents to sort of understand the process a little bit more.

110
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,633
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do I thank you for the wordsmithing.

111
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:31,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's essential.

112
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:35,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to bring us back to the public health point.

113
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:43,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we say, after abuptage, can we say and or supported as well?

114
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to make it more kind of all inclusive.

115
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:48,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, thank you.

116
00:11:48,493 --> 00:12:03,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for the following bullet point, could we say, in accessing social services after federal government cuts?

117
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:09,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

118
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:11,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Kalan.

119
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:12,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that one.

120
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:14,471
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have already caught it.

121
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:15,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't read the text up there.

122
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:22,803
[SPEAKER_01]: But it says we moved 2 million blah, blah, blah of appropriations from the Stabilization Fund appropriations.

123
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,325
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two appropriations in there.

124
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:25,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Just remove one of those.

125
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:38,827
[SPEAKER_03]: We moved a million for free cash reserves for capital stabilization fund and approved 2.3 million appropriations from stabilization.

126
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:45,290
[SPEAKER_01]: See how it says appropriations, just get rid of the second one.

127
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:45,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

128
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:46,630
Thanks.

129
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:50,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

130
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:56,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other points?

131
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:10,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a small, I mean, this is so marginal, but I think for the last three bullet points we passed, I would prefer saying we sent to this committee instead of we passed to this committee.

132
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:14,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just trying to break it up.

133
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:18,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Like technically all this was in regular meetings, but.

134
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

135
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I think past to this committee, if you're reading it past, you might think like we passed something.

136
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:30,789
[SPEAKER_04]: But saying we sent to this committee means that there's further actions.

137
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:32,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

138
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we get the heavy trucking one?

139
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:36,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was the last bit.

140
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:36,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin?

141
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:38,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

142
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:40,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we get the heavy trucking one?

143
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:41,297
[SPEAKER_01]: You were going to look up

144
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:42,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

145
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:46,710
[SPEAKER_04]: The other edits took over my mind.

146
00:14:22,782 --> 00:14:22,997
you

147
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, public works facilities.

148
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:58,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

149
00:14:58,996 --> 00:14:59,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

150
00:14:59,337 --> 00:14:59,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

151
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:00,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would also say set.

152
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:01,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

153
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so it was sent to public works and facilities?

154
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:24,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

155
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:26,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

156
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:57,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually just gonna...

157
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

158
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else have any other edits on this draft?

159
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:03,635
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't have any comments.

160
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:05,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any motions?

161
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:16,416
[SPEAKER_03]: motion to motion to approve and distribute or second on the motion to approve and distribute by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Sang.

162
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Quirk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

163
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.

164
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:24,385
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

165
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:24,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

166
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:25,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

167
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:26,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

168
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:42,772
[SPEAKER_03]: The next item on the agenda is the discussion of listening sessions, where we can basically just talk about whatever listening sessions we've attended, what the vibes were, how things went.

169
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:46,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor, oh wait, no, sorry.

170
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Requested again, I pressed the wrong button.

171
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:54,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lazaro.

172
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:55,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

173
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,384
[SPEAKER_06]: hosted a listening session at the Senior Center last week, and it was well attended.

174
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:13,409
[SPEAKER_06]: We always have a listening session, somebody from this committee, monthly, the third Thursday of each month at lunchtime at the Senior Center.

175
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:17,211
[SPEAKER_06]: We would like to be able to host more

176
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,904
[SPEAKER_06]: listening sessions and other locations on a regular basis if possible.

177
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:37,980
[SPEAKER_06]: We have hosted them with different affinity groups at the library and other areas, but the senior center has consistent availability and they always have activities happening so there's always people around.

178
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:38,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And

179
00:18:40,742 --> 00:18:48,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there are a couple of people that like to attend a lot because they have a lot of feedback to offer but they're also very keyed into things that are happening in the city.

180
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:58,519
[SPEAKER_06]: So, people come to me with thoughts about things that they would like to see and also questions so we talked a lot about parking roads.

181
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:06,142
[SPEAKER_06]: DPW work, and I'm able to bring feedback to City Hall.

182
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:12,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing I was able to talk with people about is they came to me with some questions about zoning proposals.

183
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:17,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And since zoning can be very confusing,

184
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:39,618
[SPEAKER_06]: when you see everything all at once or you just hear things on social media, it's very helpful, I find, to be able to tell people a little bit more simply and directly your understanding of what's happening, maybe exactly where they live or

185
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:43,340
[SPEAKER_06]: in an area of town that they're curious about.

186
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was able to address some questions about that.

187
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:46,702
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was very nice.

188
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:47,843
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a really nice time.

189
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:48,543
[SPEAKER_06]: We ended up meeting.

190
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:55,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually we meet in the cafeteria, but there was a demonstration about soup, which is coming, we're coming on soup season.

191
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:56,587
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was fun.

192
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:59,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed it though, cause I was doing a listening session.

193
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:04,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had to go to the library instead, which meant that we were in a much more cozy setting.

194
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,273
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, it was very, it's always fun.

195
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:16,872
[SPEAKER_06]: I encourage any seniors the third Thursday of the month to, is it the third or the fourth?

196
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:17,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth.

197
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:23,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth Thursday of the month to come to our listening sessions.

198
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:24,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always in the newsletter.

199
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:26,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you follow the newsletter, it's in there.

200
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:34,278
[SPEAKER_06]: It's often me, it's often Councilor Lemming, it's often sometimes Councilor Callahan, Councilor Svang.

201
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:37,979
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, always a good time.

202
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:39,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

203
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

204
00:20:43,758 --> 00:20:47,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a confession to make which is that

205
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:57,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a wrong calendar date on my calendar, and I accidentally missed one of the listening sessions over the summer.

206
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:05,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I came back the next day for another event they're celebrating at the Senior Center, and I also attended the 10 a.m.

207
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday morning

208
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:25,306
[SPEAKER_03]: chat with veterans at the senior center held by the veteran services director, and then a month later I did conscientiously remember to attend a

209
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,154
[SPEAKER_03]: a session at the senior center, which was a little bit more informal.

210
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:35,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like we were used to just because there were fewer people over the summer.

211
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:40,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I basically just, there were three tables where people were having their lunch.

212
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:44,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would just join each group at each different table.

213
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:51,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was much more, the situation there was more people were talking about

214
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:57,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty typical resident services issues.

215
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:04,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Trees that were growing too tall in front of people's houses, wanted attention from the

216
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:07,378
[SPEAKER_03]: from the tree warden about that.

217
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:12,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Just general questions about goings on in the city.

218
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,101
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a, which was, which was nice.

219
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:18,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a, it was a much more relaxed, relaxed environment.

220
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:25,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, in summary, I was responsible for two listening sessions these past months.

221
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:31,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I attended one of them and it was a, it was a pretty, pretty relaxing time.

222
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:34,170
[SPEAKER_03]: But if any, any other folks would like to

223
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:35,792
[SPEAKER_03]: take it up in.

224
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:40,895
[SPEAKER_03]: If any of my colleagues would like to take it up in October, just let me know.

225
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:42,897
[SPEAKER_03]: 1230, end of the month.

226
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:50,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's all I got.

227
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:54,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else have anything to report about folks that they were chatting with around the community?

228
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, thank you.

229
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Any motions on the floor?

230
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn?

231
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:19,497
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

232
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:20,297
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

233
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:21,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

234
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:21,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

235
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:22,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

236
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:24,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Meeting is adjourned.

237
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:24,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
