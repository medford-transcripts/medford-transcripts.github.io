[SPEAKER_10]: Vivalin Chavatona of the Roberts Elementary School.

65
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:37,492

[SPEAKER_10]: Amin Nazi of the McGlynn Middle School.

67
00:42:48,385 --> 00:43:00,031

71
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Medford.

72
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:37,370
[SPEAKER_03]: We are Medford.

73
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:04,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

74
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:21,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And the students read for us and shared for us quite eloquently the same resolution not only unanimously voted upon by the Medford City Council, but also the Medford School Committee and the Human Rights Commission.

75
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:32,598
[SPEAKER_10]: It's now an honor for me to introduce to you, to give her first state of the city address, the Honorable Stephanie Muccini-Burke, Mayor of Medford.

76
00:45:02,093 --> 00:45:05,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, elected officials, clergy, Ms.

77
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:10,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Clayton, you who sung so beautifully, city and school employees, and fellow Medford residents.

78
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:15,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so very much for being here, and thank you to all of those watching from home.

79
00:45:16,301 --> 00:45:21,284
[SPEAKER_04]: To the youth of our community who just recited the proclamation, you inspire us.

80
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,387
[SPEAKER_04]: You have been raised in a time of tolerance and compassion.

81
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:29,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You embrace the diversity of our city and our country.

82
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:30,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Remain vigilant.

83
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:36,228
[SPEAKER_04]: These are trying times for our nation, no matter our personal views.

84
00:45:36,728 --> 00:45:41,089
[SPEAKER_04]: But as Tip O'Neill always said, all politics is local.

85
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:48,171
[SPEAKER_04]: We're together this evening as one city because we are strong and believe in writing this chapter together.

86
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:55,393
[SPEAKER_04]: The current state of the city of Medford is summed up in three words, sound, stable, and sturdy.

87
00:45:55,973 --> 00:45:56,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And as-

88
00:46:04,796 --> 00:46:09,862
[SPEAKER_04]: As your mayor, I stand ready to work with you to chart a new course into an even greater tomorrow.

89
00:46:10,743 --> 00:46:17,791
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like the inauguration was just yesterday when we, as a community, collectively said, it all starts today.

90
00:46:18,592 --> 00:46:22,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since that day, much time has been spent among our residents,

91
00:46:22,897 --> 00:46:34,804
[SPEAKER_04]: business owners, and staff working in collaboration with one another and elected officials on all levels of government to have a high-level dialogue to renew and improve our city.

92
00:46:35,264 --> 00:46:39,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am very proud of the work done thus far, because it continues today.

93
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:47,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to start with a focus on our finances, because a sound financial foundation is the catalyst for continuing our progress.

94
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:53,914
[SPEAKER_04]: The city's unemployment rate on 12-31 was 2.3 percent, compared to Boston's 2.5.

95
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford dropped from 3.7 percent this past June.

96
00:46:58,656 --> 00:47:03,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Our bond rating is AA from Standard & Poor's and AA3 from Moody's, high-quality ratings.

97
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:09,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Average single families' homes are assessed at 476,000, and Medford has a stable housing market.

98
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,854
[SPEAKER_04]: We closed out fiscal 16 with free cash of $9.7 million.

99
00:47:16,294 --> 00:47:18,056
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our city's rainy day fund.

100
00:47:18,817 --> 00:47:26,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And since last February, Treasurer Irwin has aggressively pursued tax title cases, having collected $1.9 million, thus far compared with—

101
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:49,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Compared with 900,000 the previous year, the treasurer and assessor are implementing the Community Preservation Act, CPA, which was passed by the Medford voters this past November of 15 and went into effect on July 1st of 16.

102
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:57,925
[SPEAKER_04]: We project fiscal 17 collections to estimate $1.2 million, which will be available for use beginning in July.

103
00:47:58,606 --> 00:48:04,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Its purpose is for affordable housing, open space, and historic preservation initiatives.

104
00:48:11,073 --> 00:48:17,198
[SPEAKER_04]: We are accepting applications until February 12th for the four at-large appointments to the Community Preservation Commission.

105
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:26,787
[SPEAKER_04]: We have reinvented the senior work-off abatement program, allowing 35 seniors to earn up to $1,500 in abatements during this current fiscal year.

106
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:30,030
[SPEAKER_04]: This successful program

107
00:48:34,451 --> 00:48:41,136
[SPEAKER_04]: This successful program was a win for us seniors, it was a win for City Hall, and it was a win for the residents as a whole.

108
00:48:41,256 --> 00:48:44,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so, so much for your dedication to the city.

109
00:48:51,364 --> 00:48:52,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ruth and Vivian.

110
00:48:53,452 --> 00:49:01,735
[SPEAKER_04]: The roles included assisting in early voting, which we got 20,000 people to early vote this year, greeting people at city hall, handling the mail and other tasks.

111
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:05,776
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking to open up the program again to new seniors starting April 1st.

112
00:49:06,597 --> 00:49:11,859
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to this abatement, the city offers many statutory exemptions for seniors and veterans.

113
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:19,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I will also be forwarding a request to the city council to raise the exemption levels by 50% for veterans and seniors in the coming months.

114
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:32,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We are also working with the State Division of Local Services to review the owner-occupied exemption calculation.

115
00:49:32,748 --> 00:49:39,452
[SPEAKER_04]: We know there's a fundamental flaw in it, and we're going to work with our partners at the state to try and correct it, at least for Medford, if not for the whole Commonwealth.

116
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,514
[SPEAKER_04]: So the focus on finances continues today.

117
00:49:49,335 --> 00:49:54,917
[SPEAKER_04]: In March, our community signed on to the Governor's Community Compact, which is a commitment to best practices.

118
00:49:55,617 --> 00:50:00,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Through this compact, we are pursuing two major initiatives that directly impact the quality of life in our city.

119
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:02,459
[SPEAKER_04]: The first is Complete Streets.

120
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:06,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Complete Streets changes the thought process when performing road projects.

121
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:13,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It provides equal weight to all modes of transportation, whether it be walking, biking, wheelchairs, transit, as well as motor vehicles.

122
00:50:14,623 --> 00:50:19,187
[SPEAKER_04]: We were awarded a $400,000 grant from the state to implement this strategy.

123
00:50:20,068 --> 00:50:30,897
[SPEAKER_04]: This funding will allow us to focus on six projects that will provide the reconfiguration of intersections, pedestrian signals, bike lanes, signage, and crosswalk enhancements.

124
00:50:31,617 --> 00:50:34,740
[SPEAKER_04]: The Complete Streets team, led by our engineer, Cassandra Koudelidis,

125
00:50:36,488 --> 00:50:41,591
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be holding forums the next two Wednesday nights to review the plan so the construction can begin in the spring.

126
00:50:42,312 --> 00:50:45,453
[SPEAKER_04]: One such project is a major reconfiguration of Tufts Square.

127
00:50:46,214 --> 00:50:49,656
[SPEAKER_04]: The second compact item is the Medford Square revitalization plan.

128
00:50:50,316 --> 00:50:57,121
[SPEAKER_04]: We have received $90,000 from the State Technical Assistance Grant and the Barr Foundation Grant to facilitate the planning process.

129
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:03,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Lauren DiLorenzo has spearheaded public meetings, which provided great input and feedback.

130
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:09,571
[SPEAKER_04]: In March, we will be ready to move forward and ensure that this planning comes to fruition.

131
00:51:10,752 --> 00:51:24,528
[SPEAKER_04]: In coordination with this process, I am very, very proud to make an announcement tonight that the Rudra Hospitality Group has closed on the property at 101 George B. Hassett Drive, just next door to us.

132
00:51:34,612 --> 00:51:39,554
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be applying to construct a 124-room Premier Brand hotel with a sky bar and a 350-seat rooftop function room.

133
00:51:54,048 --> 00:52:06,480
[SPEAKER_04]: This $25 to $30 million investment will create 200 construction jobs, an estimate 50 permanent jobs, and projected tax revenues just at construction cost, not value, Mr. Assessor, is $600,000 per year to start.

134
00:52:10,775 --> 00:52:24,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank the team that includes John Veneziano of ERA Andrew, Realtors, and the Rudra Group for working with us to be the first domino to fall in the revitalization of Medford Square and trusting in this city's vision and process.

135
00:52:25,287 --> 00:52:28,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much to the group, John and the Rudra.

136
00:52:28,529 --> 00:52:29,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're here.

137
00:52:31,051 --> 00:52:31,512
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

138
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:39,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

139
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:49,585
[SPEAKER_04]: The city was also awarded a land and water grant of $250,000 that will match city money to reimagine the Riverside Plaza adjacent to the burial grounds in Medford Square.

140
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:55,092
[SPEAKER_04]: We envision this multi-purpose space to act as a common of sorts for our community events.

141
00:52:56,745 --> 00:53:06,967
[SPEAKER_04]: As Vince Lombardi said, individual commitment to a group effort, that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.

142
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:16,990
[SPEAKER_04]: It is this commitment by my transition teams, citizens, city employees, and elected officials on all levels of government that has fostered this cooperative effort.

143
00:53:18,048 --> 00:53:24,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Economic development and development in general is necessary to maintain a financially strong municipality.

144
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:30,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop two and a half without new growth barely covers contractual obligations, let alone health and pension costs.

145
00:53:31,392 --> 00:53:43,255
[SPEAKER_04]: We rely on new growth to be able to augment services, such as offering a year-round recreation program that is being recommended by our focus group, which Councilor Scott Peli is spearheading with a group of committed residents.

146
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, George.

147
00:53:51,907 --> 00:53:58,053
[SPEAKER_04]: With the housing shortage forecast from the state, we must continue to invite varied housing opportunities in our community.

148
00:53:58,753 --> 00:54:05,419
[SPEAKER_04]: And I applaud Councilman Knight, Chair of the Zoning Subcommittee, for work toward revising some outdated zoning ordinances on our books.

149
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:14,447
[SPEAKER_04]: To assist in this process, we have applied for a technical assistant grant with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, specifically for the Mystic Avenue Corridor.

150
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:15,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Adam.

151
00:54:21,195 --> 00:54:24,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So economic development continues today.

152
00:54:26,197 --> 00:54:31,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And while we stress economic development, we cannot forget the richness that the creative economy brings to our city.

153
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:40,382
[SPEAKER_04]: The Chevalier Theater is the gem of our community and adds tremendous value from cultural events, musical performances, and much, much more.

154
00:54:40,962 --> 00:54:48,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And while the first request for proposal, or RFP in our world, for management of the theater was deemed non-responsive, we have formed a new evaluation team.

155
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:56,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It is comprised of three members of the commission and three members from City Hall to craft a new RFP, which is nearly complete.

156
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:10,660
[SPEAKER_04]: We learned a great deal from the first round, and we will use this to select a partner that will invest in the infrastructure of this historic gem while managing it with a focus on partnerships with local businesses and organizations.

157
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:35,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of organizations, as a community, we are so very blessed to have entities such as Medford Arts Council, Cachet, Mystic Makerspace, Mackey, the Farmer's Market, Chamber of Commerce, Brooks Estate Land Trust, and the Human Rights Commission.

158
00:55:36,274 --> 00:55:38,536
[SPEAKER_04]: You enrich our being every day.

159
00:55:38,556 --> 00:55:39,237
[SPEAKER_04]: And I...

160
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:52,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank you for the selfless work you do each and every day to embrace and promote our creative, historic, and cultural perspectives.

161
00:55:53,511 --> 00:56:00,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We also want to thank those that served on the library building committee led by Barbara Kerr, our library director, and our president, Rick Caraviello.

162
00:56:00,955 --> 00:56:07,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Proud to say we have submitted the grant to the state for library funding, quite an accomplishment in such a short amount of time.

163
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I ask you, how do we make you aware of all the things we're doing?

164
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:27,488
[SPEAKER_04]: First, we have created linguistic capability to have ConnectCTY, better known as hashtag Barry called, to reach out to the community via phone, text, and email in 11 different languages.

165
00:56:27,668 --> 00:56:29,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Diane McLeod, for spearheading that.

166
00:56:29,809 --> 00:56:32,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

167
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:37,873
[SPEAKER_04]: We are on Facebook.

168
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter, and of course, the web.

169
00:56:40,575 --> 00:56:45,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, public access will be back on the airwaves by late spring.

170
00:56:46,577 --> 00:56:51,339
[SPEAKER_04]: The studio is being constructed at the front of Medford High School, where we will get a double bang for our buck.

171
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,122
[SPEAKER_04]: The students will learn media tech during the day, while the public will have access during the evenings.

172
00:56:57,682 --> 00:57:02,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Who better to tell the stories of Medford than you, the citizens of Medford?

173
00:57:02,564 --> 00:57:04,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mayor Mike McGlynn, for leading this.

174
00:57:11,498 --> 00:57:15,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Bringing arts and culture to the forefront continues today.

175
00:57:16,805 --> 00:57:23,153
[SPEAKER_04]: This winter, I signed on to the Metro Mayors Mitigation Compact to become carbon neutral region-wide by 2050.

176
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:23,794
[SPEAKER_04]: This raises

177
00:57:29,472 --> 00:57:33,753
[SPEAKER_04]: This raises environmental consciousness with every decision the City makes going forward.

178
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:43,215
[SPEAKER_04]: To this end, we initiated the process last fall to purchase the streetlights that are owned and managed by National Grid, with the goal to convert to LED over the summer.

179
00:57:43,955 --> 00:57:48,116
[SPEAKER_04]: We anticipate savings in electricity usage, thus reducing environmental emittances.

180
00:57:48,616 --> 00:57:55,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on direct maintenance by us of the lights, there will be a less than 5-year payback from converting to LED.

181
00:57:56,258 --> 00:57:56,718
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition,

182
00:57:57,663 --> 00:58:03,785
[SPEAKER_04]: In collaboration with the City Council, we are experimenting with increased lighting in Medford Square for our decorative lights.

183
00:58:04,425 --> 00:58:08,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Once finalized, we will fully install for a safer streetscape in our square.

184
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:16,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Office of Environment has been hard at work to receive the following grants for additional projects.

185
00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:21,911
[SPEAKER_04]: $250,000 grant from the Stanton Foundation to build a dog park at Riverbend Park, which will be built this spring.

186
00:58:21,991 --> 00:58:22,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, PAWS4.

187
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:34,688
[SPEAKER_04]: A grant from the Mass Coastal Zone Management for $125,000 to build the city's first green infrastructure to naturally clean stormwater before it flows into the Mystic.

188
00:58:35,468 --> 00:58:41,292
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a partnership with the Mystic River Watershed Association, or MIRA as we refer to it.

189
00:58:42,163 --> 00:58:51,753
[SPEAKER_04]: a partnership grant for the Clippership Connector from DCR to design and engineer the half-mile multi-use path between Medford Square and Riverbend Park.

190
00:58:52,514 --> 00:58:58,340
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in partnership with Block Medford and Myra and a generous donation from Wegmans for $23,000.

191
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Wegmans.

192
00:59:08,894 --> 00:59:12,637
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not even in our city and they're already contributing to these wonderful things.

193
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:18,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're very lucky to have them coming and they expect construction to end by next October, November timeframe.

194
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:22,726
[SPEAKER_04]: We received a green community grant, another green community grant for 250,000.

195
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:27,470
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for LED lighting in our schools, which will be installed over the next few weeks.

196
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:35,097
[SPEAKER_04]: These grants would not be possible without the hard work of the team in the energy and environment under the leadership of Alicia Hunt.

197
00:59:42,876 --> 00:59:48,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia recently received the Mystic Municipal Leadership Award from the Mystic River Watershed Association.

198
00:59:49,122 --> 00:59:51,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Alicia, for all your hard work.

199
00:59:52,605 --> 00:59:56,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to thank Eagle Scout candidate Calvin Lambert.

200
00:59:56,528 --> 00:59:57,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe he's in the audience.

201
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:59,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Calvin.

202
01:00:07,696 --> 01:00:15,442
[SPEAKER_04]: He's working with our environmental office and our Department of Public Works to build bridges around Wright's Pond for sensitive areas.

203
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:17,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you very much, Calvin, for your efforts.

204
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:34,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, we have created the Go Green Medford Coalition, which will be an umbrella entity for all sustainability-minded groups in Medford to coordinate activities and track outcomes.

205
01:00:34,695 --> 01:00:37,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Environmental focus continues today.

206
01:00:39,238 --> 01:00:46,375
[SPEAKER_04]: As chairperson of the Medford School Committee, working with committee members, administration, and faculty, our public schools continue to make great achievements.

207
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:47,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Examples include.

208
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:52,047
[SPEAKER_04]: increased access to career and technical education for Medford students.

209
01:00:52,527 --> 01:01:03,033
[SPEAKER_04]: The integration of Medford High and Medford Voc Tech has enabled our students to simultaneously participate in both rigorous academics and occupational exploration skill development.

210
01:01:03,753 --> 01:01:07,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine new Chapter 74 technical programs are now available.

211
01:01:07,755 --> 01:01:09,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Heidi, Riccio, and the superintendent.

212
01:01:17,848 --> 01:01:22,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Enrollment of ninth grade students in career tech education has doubled under her leadership.

213
01:01:23,432 --> 01:01:38,064
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also secured over $1 million in new grants to revitalize our vocational technical learning environment, and we've also captured out-of-district tuitions and generated new sources of regionalized revenue to support expansion of educational opportunities for our youth.

214
01:01:39,017 --> 01:01:45,343
[SPEAKER_04]: We have maintained a comprehensive curriculum that provides a full range of core academic subjects and specialized electives.

215
01:01:46,064 --> 01:01:56,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford offers 16 advanced placement courses, among the most in the area, as well as a full complement of art, music, technology, foreign language, and health education programs.

216
01:01:56,534 --> 01:01:57,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

217
01:02:05,712 --> 01:02:07,012
[SPEAKER_04]: and members of the school committee.

218
01:02:07,672 --> 01:02:11,813
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two standout Medford students with us tonight, Joseph Farah and Ketty Toussaint.

219
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:27,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Joseph, a Medford High School senior, took first place at the Massachusetts State Science and Engineering Fair in developing scientific models, while Ketty graduated last spring from Medford Tech and is currently enrolled at Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Services.

220
01:02:39,392 --> 01:02:43,175
[SPEAKER_04]: As an immigrant from Haiti, she left her homeland at the age of 11 with her dad.

221
01:02:43,936 --> 01:02:48,100
[SPEAKER_04]: She worked hard to learn the English language and excelled in her technical program.

222
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:53,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Ketty also earned college credit through a dual enrollment program at Bunker Hill Community College.

223
01:02:53,725 --> 01:03:00,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of these young adults demonstrate the Medford Public Schools advantage, MPS advantage, in our commitment to you.

224
01:03:09,909 --> 01:03:16,474
[SPEAKER_04]: We have introduced before school programs at our elementary schools, while after school programs are growing exponentially.

225
01:03:16,734 --> 01:03:21,138
[SPEAKER_04]: They provide substantial coverage and constructive activities for students after regular hours.

226
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:26,802
[SPEAKER_04]: We are enhancing our programs and activities to provide inclusive opportunities for all students.

227
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:35,446
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to accomplish this, substantial professional development with an emphasis on social and emotional learning in our schools has been made.

228
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:39,227
[SPEAKER_04]: We have added counseling and behavior support staff to our teams.

229
01:03:39,947 --> 01:03:44,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, we're recognized by the National School Board's Journal for School Security Practices.

230
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:49,691
[SPEAKER_04]: We have tightened security at all schools by adding staff and the Raptor ID system.

231
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:53,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Investments in our school children continue today.

232
01:04:02,737 --> 01:04:08,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Augmented security measures at our schools would not be possible without collaboration with our public safety professionals.

233
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:13,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Safety is a core component to an individual's comfort in and desire to be in a community.

234
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:20,623
[SPEAKER_04]: We have invested in state-of-the-art self-contained breathing apparatus for our firefighters and a second set of turnout gear.

235
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:25,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Medford City Council for voting that last night, for supporting this initiative.

236
01:04:25,965 --> 01:04:31,507
[SPEAKER_04]: These are to provide the most current apparatus for firefighters' safety and ultimately for your safety.

237
01:04:32,487 --> 01:04:37,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine new firefighters graduated the academy last month and one entered this past Monday.

238
01:04:37,678 --> 01:04:42,527
[SPEAKER_04]: We are working hard to keep up with retirements by accelerating the civil service process.

239
01:04:44,193 --> 01:04:49,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Kudos to our Board of Health for receipt of a seven-year, $100,000 per year grant from the Mass.

240
01:04:49,378 --> 01:04:57,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Abuse to provide opiate abuse prevention services for six cities and towns in our area.

241
01:04:57,745 --> 01:05:10,437
[SPEAKER_04]: We all understand the impact this drug has on our society, and we are making every effort to raise awareness, erase the stigma, and provide assistance for those suffering from addiction, as well as support for their families.

242
01:05:20,406 --> 01:05:27,610
[SPEAKER_04]: We have formed a team approach under Mary Ann O'Connor, who recently came to us in the last several months, for our prevention and outreach.

243
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:30,751
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an outreach manager, a recovery coach.

244
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:33,953
[SPEAKER_04]: We work with Lawrence Memorial Hospital and the Police Department.

245
01:05:34,593 --> 01:05:41,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Every life matters, and we thank our police and firefighters for volunteering to administer Narcan in this cause.

246
01:05:50,323 --> 01:05:57,147
[SPEAKER_04]: And while we are not declared a trust act city, be assured that our police department protocols do not allow for profiling.

247
01:05:57,847 --> 01:06:01,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Witnesses and victims are not asked about their immigration status.

248
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:04,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So be sure, and that's the way it is.

249
01:06:11,755 --> 01:06:14,817
[SPEAKER_04]: If you would ask me what the question posed to me most often,

250
01:06:16,303 --> 01:06:19,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to say it's when are we getting a new police station?

251
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:22,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear it day in and day out.

252
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:34,271
[SPEAKER_04]: And today, just this morning, I announced that we will be submitting a loan order to the city council next week on February 14th, requesting funds to commission an architect to begin the plans for a new station.

253
01:06:35,031 --> 01:06:38,233
[SPEAKER_04]: We have turned this city upside down looking for a new location.

254
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:40,710
[SPEAKER_04]: We've toured commercial spaces.

255
01:06:41,071 --> 01:06:42,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We've contacted property owners.

256
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:44,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Property owners have contacted us.

257
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:54,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the end, the right location, with no land costs and no relocation during construction, is the current site of the training facility on Main Street.

258
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:23,447
[SPEAKER_04]: The current facility will be demolished, and the proposed 35,000-square-foot, three-story new construction will house all amenities of the state-of-the-art resilient headquarters, including deserved equal space for our female and male officers, technology upgrades, and, most importantly, safe interior space for our offices' well-being.

259
01:07:23,888 --> 01:07:26,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Public safety investments continue today.

260
01:07:37,758 --> 01:07:45,505
[SPEAKER_04]: In conclusion, this city of ours, this great city of ours, continues to move forward on a foundation built on dialogue.

261
01:07:46,446 --> 01:07:54,313
[SPEAKER_04]: A dialogue that echoes in this building, allowing the voices of all residents to be heard with an attitude of inclusion and fairness.

262
01:07:55,254 --> 01:08:01,719

264
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:19,329
[SPEAKER_04]: On this night, in our beautiful city hall, and I say that the state of our city is sound, it is stable, and it is sturdy.

[SPEAKER_05]: I'm inspired.

275
01:09:53,544 --> 01:10:02,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking, I don't like sound stable and sturdy, because that sounds so sound, stable and sturdy.

276
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:11,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was thinking that it felt pretty spectacular and scintillating and safe for all and Stephanie.

277
01:10:15,267 --> 01:10:23,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm inspired to invite you to do something for me, citizens of Medford.

278
01:10:23,672 --> 01:10:31,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if, for just a minute, we could have all of our elected and staff, city staff, sit down for a second.

279
01:10:32,576 --> 01:10:34,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Elected and city staff.

280
01:10:34,537 --> 01:10:38,840
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody else, I'm gonna ask you to help me bless these people.

281
01:10:40,162 --> 01:10:46,307
[SPEAKER_05]: would you just extend a hand towards the people who are serving you today?

282
01:10:47,808 --> 01:10:49,670
[SPEAKER_05]: For it continues today.

283
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:52,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And join me in the spirit of blessing.

290
01:11:16,685 --> 01:11:24,291

293
01:11:42,401 --> 01:11:55,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Help them to be that which we need in this city to make us scintillating and exciting and future oriented at the same time that we are grounded in all that we have been.

299
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:27,398
[SPEAKER_05]: May God continue today to look upon Medford with kindness and grace and love.

300
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:30,540
[SPEAKER_05]: And we pray all of this in the name of love.

301
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the people say amen.

302
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:47,764
[SPEAKER_10]: My, my, can she pray.

303
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Lieutenant Casey, retire the colors.

304
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:48,187
