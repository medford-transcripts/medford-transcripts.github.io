1
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:35,978
Thank you very much.

2
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:35,845
you

3
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:08,172
Test one, two.

4
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:02,776
technical issues first.

5
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:44,796
27 to 2025.

6
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:46,918
Welcome to our first meeting of 2025.

7
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:49,941
Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?

8
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:56,887
President Behrs, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Scarpelli, present.

9
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:58,229
Chair Seng.

10
00:13:58,829 --> 00:13:59,270
Present.

11
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,392
Five present, none absent.

12
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:05,656
We also have Councilor Callahan in attendance with us as well.

13
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:13,916
Resolution 24-468, Resolution to Discuss Updates to the City Charter.

14
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:24,084
We received from the mayor's office the Charter Study Committee's recommendations along with a letter from the mayor.

15
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:26,746
I believe that all councilors received this in their inboxes.

16
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:34,453
We also have printed copies in front of our councilors tonight, if you prefer to look at everything through print.

17
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:41,998
I wanted to use this meeting to set us up for success in the next few meetings.

18
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:47,584
There's some tasks that we have ahead of us.

19
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,929
First, I wanted to outline a

20
00:14:55,333 --> 00:15:05,900
the upcoming meeting timelines and proposed topics for discussion and get all of your feedbacks on this proposed timeline.

21
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,603
I wanna note first that this is flexible.

22
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:14,765
We can move topics around based on what counselors want to discuss most.

23
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:22,550
And I also want to note that the call-in center will graciously be present at our next three meetings.

24
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:30,034
So our next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, January 22, 2025.

25
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:45,703
Um, I think for that meeting, it would make sense to talk about the preamble article one, which talks about, uh, which is the incorporation of the short title definitions, um, article two about the legislative branch.

26
00:15:45,824 --> 00:15:55,707
So very much concerning the city council and what we do, um, and article, um, nine general provisions, section nine to six, which fall in line.

27
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:58,608
Um, I think pair wall with.

28
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:02,986
the other two topics that I mentioned.

29
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:10,710
The meeting following that will be Tuesday, February 4, 2025.

30
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,792
The topics I have listed for discussion then are articles

31
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:19,014
three, which concerns the executive branch.

32
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:26,501
So the mayor's office, article five, administrative organization, city departments, etc.

33
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:33,167
Article six, financial procedures for the city, and article seven elections.

34
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:41,154
So more focused, I was thinking that meeting could be more focused on the executive branch and, and those powers of the city.

35
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:51,087
And then for the final meeting for which we have the Collins Center with us, that would be Wednesday, February 19th, 2025.

36
00:16:54,029 --> 00:17:04,239
And what I have listed down there are kind of the rest of the articles I haven't mentioned yet, but which are big topics that might need

37
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:07,477
a good amount of focus and a good amount of conversation.

38
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:27,752
Articles 4, which regards the school committee, Article 8, which is about citizen participation mechanisms, and Article 9, all the other sections of the general provisions that we won't have gotten to in the first deep dive meeting.

39
00:17:29,873 --> 00:17:56,289
Let me pause there first and ask my fellow councillors if they have any ideas about that proposed timeline, if there's anything that they'd want to shift around, any topics they would want to cover in a different order or cover first.

40
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:59,131
Council President Behrs, give me one sec.

41
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:00,548
here we go.

42
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:14,753
Thank you chair saying I appreciate the work that you've put into outlining a timeline for the council to consider the proposed draft from the mayor based on the recommendations of the Charter Study Committee.

43
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:19,154
I think that this timeline makes sense.

44
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,315
My biggest

45
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:30,145
concern is around inviting the participation of the school committee and the other boards and commissions.

46
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:35,689
So I think having that as our final meeting gives them time to provide feedback.

47
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:44,334
I have heard from some members of the school committee and some chairs of boards and commissions that they would like to provide some feedback on the proposed draft.

48
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:49,497
So giving them as much time as possible to do that, I believe makes a lot of sense.

49
00:18:51,100 --> 00:19:01,963
Of course, the mayor has already reviewed this document and made, I believe, changes from the initial recommendations of the study committee to what we see here today.

50
00:19:02,563 --> 00:19:12,185
So having that be the second meeting also makes sense to me and discussing all of that, but I just wanted to note that she had a swing at this already.

51
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:22,869
Um, and then I think, you know, our first meeting being discussing the council also makes a lot of sense, uh, because we haven't had a look at this yet.

52
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:30,252
Um, this is our first look and we are likely, I think, to make some changes and amendments similar to what the mayor has done.

53
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:33,053
So, um, I think this is a good timeline.

54
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:53,207
I do have a few motions that I want to make towards the end of the meeting after we hear more discussion around just have some questions, some thoughts around procedures and how we'll get more information and of course solicit that input from the school committee and the boards and commissions.

55
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:59,970
But I'm also really interested to hear what my fellow counselors think about the draft that we see so far.

56
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:10,741
what articles may need the most attention versus what articles may not need as much.

57
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:24,533
And then I also think, and it's technical, I think we may, there's also a question about article 10, which I just don't think we listed.

58
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:27,336
That's okay.

59
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,440
It's just transitional provisions.

60
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:39,088
So I think it's really not actually it basically just says everything continues as this moves forward.

61
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:42,591
But we may want to talk about that towards the end as well.

62
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:47,375
But I think I don't really that seems to be really technical and more just about.

63
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:54,271
the form of how adopting this new charter impacts the existing charter.

64
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:58,113
So I don't think that would be of significant discussion.

65
00:20:59,073 --> 00:20:59,934
At least I don't think so.

66
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:02,155
Thank you.

67
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:11,099
President Beres, just to clarify, are you saying that maybe we can take up Article 10 at the end of our last meeting?

68
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:12,720
Yeah.

69
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,460
Okay.

70
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:23,725
Do any other councilors have any comments?

71
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:34,548
I know there's some folks watching at home, by the way, just to clarify that general provision section 9-6 is about, I believe it's about review city ordinances.

72
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:43,870
So that's why I was thinking that we could do that with the other city council related legislative branch provisions.

73
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:55,428
Seeing, oh, Vice President Collins, give me one sec.

74
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:00,212
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

75
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:14,901
I know there's been a lot of people who have put a lot of work into this document so far, and it's exciting to be at this stage in the process where we can review kind of an interim result from those many months, I mean, more than months, years of work.

76
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:17,183
I think we have to take into account the

77
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:22,126
years of advocacy for an updated charter that resulted in the process that we're now a part of.

78
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:27,449
So that's really exciting to see how this is progressing, exciting to have it before us.

79
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,172
And it is quite a lot to go through.

80
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:38,235
Over the past couple of weeks, I've been going through section by section and just noting notes and questions.

81
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:45,860
And I think the way to break this down, I think the framing to me makes a lot of sense of thinking about what is closest to our work as a body.

82
00:22:46,440 --> 00:23:02,925
what do we really require meeting with other bodies, the school committee, other department heads on to get that context from how it affects their work and structuring how we'll go through this document, structuring a timeline around that.

83
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:13,149
At the same time, I know that we have a pretty strict timeline if we want the legislature to be able to take up the final result of our action this term, which I know we very much do.

84
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,953
we have to make sure that we're doing all of this work on a pretty timely pace.

85
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:20,816
So I think that this is ambitious, but I think that it's doable.

86
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:23,719
This is going to be a very major project for the City Council this spring.

87
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:36,552
I think it will become apparent to us as we go through these first three meetings, if we need any additional input, if we need any additional time on, you know, for example, the more technical procedural

88
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:45,150
things at the end if we run out of time for those because we're talking about the more substantive governance related topics with the call and sender.

89
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:47,432
But I think this is doable.

90
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:58,680
And I think that this is a, this is an area where, you know, we can say as a city council, we know that we have to allocate a lot of resources to this project over the next three or four months, because it has a really, you know, because it has a really defined

91
00:23:59,676 --> 00:24:02,399
timeline on it, but I like the way you've laid it out.

92
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:12,270
I think it makes sense to talk about the sections that impact the City Council most directly first, certainly the ones that I flipped to first.

93
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:17,817
I think that, you know, not to say that it's the only section that's germane to our work,

94
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:26,840
Most of the highlighting that I did was in the executive section around financial procedures and the annual budgeting process, and that affects our work very intimately as well.

95
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:35,364
I think it makes sense to give ourselves and city staff a little bit more time to get together our notes and our questions for that meeting in February.

96
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:37,405
That'll be a very substantive one.

97
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:44,208
So I think this is a great plan to start out with.

98
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:46,669
And thank you for your work in structuring it.

99
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:47,801
Thank you.

100
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:49,844
Thank you for those comments.

101
00:24:50,705 --> 00:25:00,916
I think it's helpful to hear what sections you found to be the most subject to highlighting.

102
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:06,102
And I think that's helpful to know because I think that will guide how we distribute time.

103
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:07,824
To note,

104
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:21,872
We are working on a timely basis just to make sure we can get the legislature fast enough so that we can put it on the ballot this fall for Medford voters, at least that's the goal.

105
00:25:26,014 --> 00:25:34,959
One of the things that we've been working out in scheduling, we've been thinking about in scheduling is maybe, if needed, a fourth meeting to summarize and wrap stuff up, make

106
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,660
technical procedures though.

107
00:25:37,261 --> 00:25:39,663
I think that's something to keep in mind.

108
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:46,869
But the goal is to get this out of committee by the end of February slash early March, in my opinion.

109
00:25:49,111 --> 00:26:02,642
Do any other councillors want to talk about sections that they might want to discuss more slash delegate more time to, or any more general thoughts about the timeline that we've been discussing?

110
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:09,728
President Beers, are you requesting?

111
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:15,935
Okay, I see no questions about that.

112
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:27,727
I guess, do we have any more general comments outside of that line of questioning, Vice President Collins?

113
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:30,903
Thank you.

114
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:42,452
Yeah, and just another note on timeline I'm thinking as I'm looking over the list thinking about, you know, what are the topics that we're going to have the heaviest discussion about and what are the topics that the public is most likely to be have the most questions about.

115
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,531
be most keenly interested in.

116
00:26:45,612 --> 00:27:09,197
Obviously, they're spread throughout this timeline, but I could see, especially with the proposed changes to board representation and at-large representation, I think it makes sense to have elections not be the very first thing that we take up to give people time to save the day, to know to turn out, because that is a change that I know a lot of people have been advocating for, that people will want to be able to have noticed before that discussion.

117
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:25,989
I think similar to that note, I think this gives us time to focus and hone in on different sections of the charter and talk to different stakeholders and different experts.

118
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:31,572
And that's something to consider when we move forward with this too.

119
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:44,757
with regards to more specific ideas about amendments or suggested changes or more general sections that we just want to review.

120
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:53,381
I did want to ask this committee to think about how we might want to submit

121
00:27:54,133 --> 00:28:14,001
feedback before ahead of meetings so that, because there's so much information to deal with, so that we can organize that information first before we go into these upcoming meetings about them, and to consider ways that we can address questions before the actual meeting themselves.

122
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:17,382
I didn't know if any councilors had any ideas about that.

123
00:28:17,523 --> 00:28:20,384
I see President Behrs has requested.

124
00:28:21,854 --> 00:28:22,214
Thank you.

125
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:28,757
Yeah, and I just wanted to note to Councilor Collins point the composition questions.

126
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:41,883
I think some of the main concerns are going to be the composition and term length of the different bodies that we would discuss the council as our part of it's part of Article two, the mayor is part of Article three, and then the school committee is part of Article four.

127
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:45,484
So those would be happening across the three separate meetings.

128
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:55,403
It's probably, I think, actually good considering that those are certainly major suggested changes being proposed.

129
00:28:57,123 --> 00:28:59,884
Also, compensation is across those three.

130
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:07,687
So that's just another thing we're going to have to take a look at, maybe put to bed forever, which I think everyone would appreciate.

131
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,889
And I do have some thoughts on feedback.

132
00:29:14,947 --> 00:29:38,623
My first thought is that councilors, and it's obviously not necessarily, you know, folks are going to have ideas and questions in the moment, and it's not to preclude that, but to request if folks do have suggested changes or questions in advance, I would move that we request that councilors submit those in writing to the clerk.

133
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:48,059
by the Thursday before the upcoming meeting so that those can be added into the packet for all of us to see and take a look at.

134
00:29:49,699 --> 00:30:02,207
and also to request that counselors submit questions for the call-in center to Chair Seng by the one week before the meeting, just so we can give them some time to prepare.

135
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:12,594
That doesn't mean we won't have questions in the moment or that answers to our questions may spawn new questions, which I think we've seen, but I just think getting some of that in writing

136
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:18,109
earlier will help the call-in center come prepared, help us come prepared.

137
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:38,327
So that would be my motion to request councilors submit in writing points of discussion or specific amendments on the Thursday prior to each meeting on the topics for each meeting and to submit questions for the call-in center to Chair Tsang one week prior to each meeting so that Chair Tsang can submit those to the call-in center.

138
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:40,496
Great.

139
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:45,301
We can take votes at the end, but do we have a second for that motion?

140
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,064
Seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

141
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:02,185
Great.

142
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:11,408
Do we have any thoughts about requesting feedback from any stakeholders or other elected officials of the city?

143
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:14,949
I know much of these charter changes will affect them as well.

144
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:16,990
President Behrs?

145
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:45,679
you chair saying yeah I have I can just go through my the rest of what I have I'd also make a motion to request that feedback from the school committee and any boards and commissions be received by Wednesday February 12th for consideration for the meeting on February 19th and of course this can be submitted earlier than that if there are topics that

146
00:31:46,618 --> 00:32:02,344
boards and commissions or the school committee want to discuss in those first two meetings, but I think a lot of that, I think there's a bunch of stuff about multi-member bodies in the section in Article 9, the school committee in Article 4.

147
00:32:03,764 --> 00:32:07,726
So that last meeting seems to be where most of that discussion would happen, so that's

148
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,601
where I'm suggesting that motion.

149
00:32:13,023 --> 00:32:18,547
And then I'd also make a motion to, well, if you want to consider that, I can do my motion.

150
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:20,048
Okay.

151
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:30,036
Do we have a second for President Behrs' motion about getting feedback from the school committee and members of other multi-member bodies?

152
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:33,399
Seconded by Councilor Zaro.

153
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:37,262
We can take a vote on, we can join and take a vote on all of them at the end.

154
00:32:37,282 --> 00:32:37,722
Okay, great.

155
00:32:40,482 --> 00:33:01,707
My third motion would be requesting that the Collins Center provide a memorandum, if possible, outlining which provisions of this draft, one, make no change to the existing charter, two, change provisions of the existing charter, and three, create new provisions which aren't included in the existing charter.

156
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:03,687
And that is just, you know,

157
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:09,354
I have a decent idea of that, but I'm not 100% sure.

158
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:10,814
I can email that to you, Mr. Clerk.

159
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:16,378
I can email it to you right now.

160
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:19,039
Do we have a second for that motion?

161
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:31,267
Sorry, yeah, it's just requesting a memorandum if they could possibly, and I get maybe it's not possible for them to do this, but to outline for this draft, what is not changing

162
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,900
what is changing and what is brand new, essentially.

163
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:43,363
Because I think that comparative, you know, one of the reasons we're doing this is because the charter is so opaque.

164
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:49,385
So, yeah.

165
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:51,365
Also seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

166
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:51,906
Thank you.

167
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:55,007
Did you have any more motions or?

168
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:58,048
Yeah, I just had one last one and it's just to

169
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:03,424
and I'm just getting this to the clerk.

170
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:06,945
No worries.

171
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:07,666
Great.

172
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:29,354
And I just emailed it as well, but my last request is just that the mayor included an announcement, the upcoming dates for these meetings in like the city of Medford events update online by text and by robocall, just so that folks are informed that these are the upcoming meetings for the city charter process for the council.

173
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,294
I think that makes a lot of sense.

174
00:34:32,075 --> 00:34:35,216
I see Councilor Lazarus seconded that motion as well.

175
00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:47,200
I think it can also, as Councillors ourselves, if we could post on social media pages to make sure that people know that these meetings are happening and how they're structured.

176
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,302
so they know which meetings that they're interested in, they can come to.

177
00:34:51,542 --> 00:35:02,066
And we might have some resident services listening groups in the meantime, we'll make sure to get the word out on that front as well.

178
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:05,668
Are there any other motions before we consider those motions?

179
00:35:09,616 --> 00:35:10,436
I don't see any.

180
00:35:12,057 --> 00:35:13,917
I'll move to public participation right now.

181
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:20,319
There aren't any people in person, so if you're online, please raise your hand.

182
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:25,081
Please use the raise hand function on Zoom, and I will make sure to call on you.

183
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,645
I don't see any hands raised on Zoom either,

184
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,255
Do I have a motion possibly to join and approve?

185
00:35:42,775 --> 00:35:44,977
I move to join the motion and approve.

186
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:54,326
So President Behrs has moved to join the motions he's made and approve.

187
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:57,189
That's been seconded by Councilor Zara.

188
00:35:57,649 --> 00:35:59,211
So Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

189
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,600
President Behrs.

190
00:36:14,081 --> 00:36:14,301
Yes.

191
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:18,304
Vice President Collins, Councilor Lozano, Councilor Scarpelli.

192
00:36:21,026 --> 00:36:21,307
Yes.

193
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:23,609
Chair Seng.

194
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:23,989
Yes.

195
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:26,751
Five in affirmative, none against.

196
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:28,312
Motion passes.

197
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:38,220
And before we adjourn, I just wanted to thank, I see a lot of members of the Charter Study Committee on Zoom today.

198
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,622
I wanted to thank you for your work,

199
00:36:41,643 --> 00:36:46,528
thank the mayor's office for reviewing this and putting forward her recommendations to us.

200
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:49,772
This is something that I'm personally very, very excited about.

201
00:36:49,812 --> 00:36:57,940
I know I've seen a lot of enthusiasm online in my email inboxes and my phone inboxes about this.

202
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:02,965
This is a real project that's going to make Medford

203
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:08,208
more modern, more updated, more responsive to a resident.

204
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:11,988
So I'm very, very happy and optimistic about where this is going to go.

205
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:16,269
I think much of this has been collaborative so far.

206
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:24,010
I know, substantively, we have a lot to talk about in the next month, but I'm very, very excited for this.

207
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:32,072
I thank my councillors for showing up today, too, and for contributing to the discourse about this in a positive way.

208
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:36,144
Do I have a motion to adjourn?

209
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,773
Councilor, Vice President Collins has made a motion to adjourn.

210
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:44,738
Seconded by Councilor Lazar.

211
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,902

00:38:00,674 --> 00:38:06,063
President Behrs, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Scarpelli.

00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:06,784
Yes.

214
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:08,687
Chair Seng.

215
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:09,028
Yes.

216
00:38:09,148 --> 00:38:10,891
Five in the affirmative, none absent.

217
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:11,853
