1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,100
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,961
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,362
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,402
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:20,743
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:28,905
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:32,806
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:35,287
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,760
All right, thanks for being here with me today.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,902
If you don't mind introducing yourself just with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,683
Well, I'm Jennifer Miller.

12
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:56,266
My pronouns are she, her, hers.

13
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:02,668
Well, I'm a mental health counselor turned drama teacher turned retreat holder.

14
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:05,431
Great, thank you.

15
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:12,194
And before we get into, I think we're going to talk a lot about the retreats and some of your upcoming events here in Medford.

16
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:20,538
But before we do that, I just want to ask you the question that I ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

17
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:28,711
Yeah, I actually think this was just said on your podcast, but I'm just going to go with it, because even when I was living in Somerville, I went there.

18
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,032
So I'm going to say Bocelli's.

19
00:01:31,193 --> 00:01:38,737
They've just make a really mean clam sauce with linguine, and it's comfort food to me.

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,802
Yeah, I've never been there, but people mention it a lot.

21
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:42,663
I know.

22
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:44,424
Great.

23
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:45,966
Cool.

24
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:51,050
So I think we were introduced to learn a little bit more about your retreat.

25
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,572
So I understand it's called Taking Time Retreat.

26
00:01:53,592 --> 00:02:00,418
So I'm wondering if you could just share with us what prompted you to start this, what it is, what you want us to know about it.

27
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:01,867
Sure, sure.

28
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:05,149
So my business is Taking Time Retreats.

29
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,151
The retreat that, actually, it's a summer camp this year.

30
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:13,716
So this year is the inaugural summer camp called Taking Time on the Cape.

31
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:29,368
So sort of the inspiration was, like I said, my background is in mental health counseling, but I always did a lot more body-based work, even with the students that I worked with, more somatics, like bottom-up.

32
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:34,250
So I'm working as a teacher in a school right now.

33
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,652
And the teachers that I was working with have gone through a lot.

34
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:43,534
So we obviously went through the pandemic that everyone went through.

35
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:48,816
We went through, but then our building actually collapsed.

36
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:54,758
And so we got moved to Tufts and then we got moved to the Edgerly building.

37
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:56,139
So I'm in Somerville right now.

38
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,660
So they were,

39
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,790
obviously very stressed out.

40
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,792
We're coming back from the hardest time in our history and with all these moves.

41
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:12,052
So I had a teacher who actually asked me to run a retreat.

42
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:17,654
And I had gone to retreats, I had run some private ones outside of school.

43
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:23,495
So I was really excited because this is, in my next life, this is where I wanted to go.

44
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:39,041
We did it, and what I realized, these connections that you make with people, the way you can get in touch with just kind of who they are in a level that just feels so comfortable.

45
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:43,662
We used art, we used movement, we laughed way too much.

46
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:47,844
So that was the logical step for me.

47
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:51,505
But I was sort of inspired because

48
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,966
When I was thinking of retreats, I really wanted to do something with women.

49
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:02,871
I have the best friends on the planet.

50
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:09,140
The happiest times I've ever been is just connecting with other women and learning from other women.

51
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:16,256
And there are a million yoga retreats, and there are a million mental health retreats and mindful things.

52
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:22,083
But there is this place in France called Camp Chateau.

53
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:26,308
And so it was specifically a camp for women.

54
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,451
And I had this aha moment.

55
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:40,401
So I had this moment, what if there was a place where women could get together and they didn't have to be yogis, and they didn't have to only want to do outdoorsy things?

56
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:47,387
What if they wanted to be taken care of like they take care of their family, I think, you know, to

57
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:57,894
To generalize, I think that we are very much caretakers in so many aspects of our life that we don't stop and necessarily give that.

58
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:12,964
And of course, you can do it on a vacation or you can do it by just resting, but not mindfully leaning into things that your body needs, things that bring you joy, making art with other people, making connections with other people.

59
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:20,472
It is my deepest belief that there is no other healing that happens outside of connection.

60
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:30,143
So I just I didn't want to limit it to say, oh, we're going to I'm going to run a yoga retreat and cut out so many people that could really benefit from

61
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,604
from this connection.

62
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:37,588
So yeah, so then I repartnered with this woman, Lindsay Singleton.

63
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:46,695
Back in the day, to go back to the acting thing, I actually used to do these violence prevention shows around the country.

64
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:54,463
So we would do a show on domestic abuse, and she was actually the clinician, and I was the actor.

65
00:05:55,084 --> 00:06:05,074
So we really worked well together, and then when we splintered off, she started working for Endicott College, and she was running all these retreats, and she was a counselor for them.

66
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,898
She has her own private practice, and so when we started talking,

67
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,621
this moment just, it was a convergence of ideas.

68
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:22,567
I said, what if, you know, women go to this beautiful place where everything is beautiful to look at, it's warm, it's comfortable.

69
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:27,891
If they walk out the door and they turn their head, there's a cantina of water.

70
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:36,116
When they want to go to the beach, there is a bag packed for them with snacks and drinks and everything, they don't have to think about it.

71
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,958
What if they want to wake up and do yoga?

72
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:44,446
What if they want to talk about the fact that their menopausal bodies are changing?

73
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:46,887
And there's so much going on in there.

74
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,789
I said, what if we could do all of it?

75
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:52,430
And they just feel held.

76
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,511
And so she was really excited.

77
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:58,613
And so that's how Taking Time on the Cape was born.

78
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,291
It sounds really cool.

79
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:13,977
I think that what you're describing, caregivers, women, teachers, the people that spend a lot of their time caring for other people, it sounds like, from experience, can be a really isolating thing.

80
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:15,478
We know other people go through it.

81
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:23,881
Maybe we even have our own individual therapist that we talk about that with, but being able to get together with people that have a shared experience

82
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:30,149
It sounds like very healing and also just like a nice kind of time out to be cared for.

83
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:35,717
I'm curious like how many people you're you're wanting to or you're expecting to join.

84
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,321
So we have capacity.

85
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:41,983
So there were two different models that we played with.

86
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,244
So at first, we rented the space for five days.

87
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:55,029
And then after thinking about it and talking, many women said that five days felt like a huge ask to get away from their families.

88
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,631
So we went down to two different sessions.

89
00:07:57,731 --> 00:08:01,593
So it's August 18th through the 21st, and then the 21st through the 24th.

90
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:11,843
And so each session we can hold up to 40 women and our minimum is 30 women.

91
00:08:13,064 --> 00:08:13,986
So yeah.

92
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:15,227
Cool.

93
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:22,155
Yeah, I guess I'm wondering like what you hope like the impact to be for for the city of Medford.

94
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:31,293
Yeah, I mean, I just, I know every single woman I meet here, I've made some amazing connections.

95
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,195
We moved here in 2019.

96
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:42,803
I think the connection that I want, the impact I want to make in Medford is that it gives women space

97
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:48,608
to just be their authentic self, to do the thing.

98
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:54,894
So each year I go on a women's retreat that's completely bare bones.

99
00:08:55,014 --> 00:09:02,320
It is not Lululemon, it is very real humans doing real things, and it's all women.

100
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,625
And I joke with my husband because I'll go to the retreat, it's only three days,

101
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:12,800
When I leave there, I'm so much more productive.

102
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,643
I'm more available emotionally to my family.

103
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:18,425
I'm more emotionally available to my friends.

104
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:20,948
And so I always say to him, I'm OK.

105
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:22,149
I only have 364 days left now.

106
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:45,210
So, you know, and my son's in soccer here in Medford, and I've met some amazing women in soccer, and they're all just, we're just so busy, and I even, I have two best friends in Medford that we will,

107
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:49,946
We're moments from each other and just connecting is so hard.

108
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:57,489
So what, I mean, this is gonna sound totally Pollyanna, but I want everyone to connect like that.

109
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:04,112
I want everyone to feel this sense of joy that I, and I don't think it's frivolous at all.

110
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:12,596
I think that there are moments in our life that frivolity is really, really important, like vacations where you don't have to think about a thing,

111
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:20,102
But this feels more like you're carving out space to make true connections.

112
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:28,209
I mean, you may want to sit on the beach and not talk to anyone, but there's going to be one person that you connect with.

113
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,734
And I honestly believe that that's the only way that people

114
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:37,549
transform, that people get re-energized.

115
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,391
It's through each other.

116
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:40,432
It's through relationships.

117
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:43,316
And so I want them to make relationships.

118
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:44,357
Yeah, that's great.

119
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:44,998
I hear that.

120
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,362
So it's interesting that you moved here in 2019, like right before COVID.

121
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,845
And I feel like that was for us to like

122
00:10:52,746 --> 00:11:19,821
um when you know everyone was at home or like just kind of confined to their neighborhoods that's when i met ifa who introduced us and we you know we have this group that meets every friday to like for exercise but it's become this like i like the some of the most valuable connections right like other moms who have kids at the same school who are kind of dealing with the same kind of lifetime things and it's like we only see you know we see each other one hour a week but it's turned into like this great group of friends and like

123
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:25,790
You know, I think for anybody to have that connection, Medford is full of like great women, I think just great people.

124
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,174
And so to be able to connect those people is awesome.

125
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:34,785
And I heard that you're starting, you wanted to talk a little bit about the meetups that you're starting too, just in Medford.

126
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:43,651
Yes, so this was more inspired by the climate of what we're going through.

127
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:50,614
So in my family, we adopted a daughter from Mexico.

128
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:53,755
She identifies as non-binary.

129
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:59,357
And so one of the things for us is, I mean, I think previous to this,

130
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,641
are strong believers in equal rights and human rights.

131
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:14,726
And I think that right now, a lot of people are feeling scared.

132
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,827
A lot of people are feeling pressure.

133
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:21,350
I know the last time this happened,

134
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,654
I kind of went dark and squirrelly.

135
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:30,135
I didn't do the things that I would tell all of my clients to do.

136
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:39,617
When I was counseling, I just scrolled Facebook waiting for an answer to pop up that miraculously would fix everything.

137
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:42,498
And surprisingly, it never happened, not even once.

138
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:50,199
So this time, I knew that to sit at home

139
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:58,794
and wring my hands and go over what is happening in isolation felt

140
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:03,103
felt kind of more decadent almost.

141
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:10,325
I have the privilege to sit and worry and not talk and connect and act.

142
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:16,246
So I decided that I'm sure that there are other people right now feeling the same thing.

143
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:22,748
And again, I know that there are so many wonderful men doing so many wonderful things.

144
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:24,129
My husband's one of them.

145
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:25,569
He's a great man.

146
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:26,829
He's an amazing ally.

147
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:27,890
But I

148
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,180
Deep in my heart, I know that when women get together, transformation really happens.

149
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:48,204
And I think it can easily feel silenced sometimes if there's not enough female voices.

150
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:49,344
It can feel silenced.

151
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:57,307
So what I came up with is an idea called Wicked Mindful Women, because we're in Boston, so wicked.

152
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:00,939
And it's just an idea to come together.

153
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,002
I connected with this woman on Facebook, Mindy.

154
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:05,783
She's going to be helping me with it.

155
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:10,528
But the way the structure will work is we're going to meet bimonthly.

156
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:12,850
The hope is that we

157
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:23,474
learn to, I kind of said, we're not at the healing stage, because we're still going through things, but maybe we can start putting salve on our wounds.

158
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:31,998
We can actively protect what is hurting as we're moving forward, and then we can prioritize.

159
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:41,382
So the idea is all the people at the table will come up with some ideas on what is important to them, what they're struggling with,

160
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:50,587
And so we'll start in, we'll start personal, and we'll start with healing, and then we'll start with prioritizing action.

161
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:59,211
And then what we would love to do is have a space, so probably a virtual space where people can put action items on.

162
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:00,972
So things that are happening in our community.

163
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,054
I know that there are food banks.

164
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:04,895
I know that there are lawyers that are

165
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:06,876
kind of doing the thing.

166
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:10,338
I know that there's counselors who are ready to support.

167
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:24,669
And so how wonderful would it be if there's one central place that people just knew, if I pop on this website, I'm going to be able to like scoop up any action item and get going and get really start getting to work.

168
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,470
That's great.

169
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,531
When is this starting?

170
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:31,395
This next Thursday, so we're gonna be at deep cuts.

171
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:32,775
They gave us the back room.

172
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:56,403
So we have plenty of space We you know, mrs. Murphy's when you open Yeah, so but we're um, so they're deep cuts is being amazing they're like, yep, go on do do all the things and so we'll be there and Yeah, and you know who knows it could be great could could not but I figure anytime

173
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,885
there's awesome people in a room, magic happens.

174
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:02,549
And that's Galentine's Day, I think.

175
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:05,291
I know!

176
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:11,578
How can people find out more information or how to get involved or connect with you?

177
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,060
So they can always go.

178
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:22,425
So I have my retreat website, which is takingtimeretreats.com.

179
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:25,767
Or I am on Facebook.

180
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:30,190
I'm on the Medford family, Medford moms and dads.

181
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:33,252
I'm posting things right now.

182
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:36,835
So I've posted a flyer for the event.

183
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:40,818
But they can also I mean, I'm happy if people email me.

184
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:51,046
It's Jennifer Miller at taking time retreats calm so So that's a that's a great way to do that Thank you.

185
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:57,751
Yeah, I can put all that stuff in our show notes for people Is there anything else that you that we forgot to talk about or that you want to make sure people know about?

186
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:20,108
I think what I want people to talk about is whether it is on the summer in the Cape with me, which I think is the best idea, or in their living room with their besties, or at an amazing restaurant in Medford, don't

187
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:22,666
go in right now.

188
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:28,112
Like right now is definitely not the time to just hunker down.

189
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:35,819
Now is the time to reach out to the people you love, reconnect with that person that maybe you just lost a little touch with.

190
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,465
Now is the time to find a way to be with people in joy.

191
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,567
You know, I keep hearing this and

192
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:54,557
And when you're darkest, it sounds really trite, but I think it is really the strongest medicine, that we are a community.

193
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:56,158
And I really feel that in Medford.

194
00:17:56,178 --> 00:18:02,381
When I got to the city, I loved, I really loved living in Somerville, but it wasn't like here.

195
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,403
The women that I've met here feel like family.

196
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:11,786
And so at this time, find a way, take a pause.

197
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:12,186
Your family,

198
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:23,578
deserves you taking a break and recharging because there's there's so much and you can't do it on an empty tank.

199
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:26,981
You have to do it in relationship and full.

200
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:28,403
I think that, you know.

201
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:34,985
If it's with me, the better, but if it isn't, that's great too.

202
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:41,009
However you got to do it, you know, like some women have said to me, I can't go right now.

203
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:42,310
I can't open this all up.

204
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,853
I can't talk about anything that's happening without it kind of breaking me.

205
00:18:48,553 --> 00:18:52,196
And that's great too, you know, that's great to recognize too, but then,

206
00:18:53,055 --> 00:19:00,299
But then put it down, find your way to energize and let's get, let's get going.

207
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:09,663
Yeah, I mean yeah I think you're right like that deep dark hole people are in, and I think even knowing that other people are in it too and that you can kind of relate to how that like might feel.

208
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:34,073
I think is can be sort of comforting but also energizing right like and I do think what you're saying like Medford is a great community and and I feel like it's a community where the people that live here have a lot of power to like influence you know what goes on in the city so like they're, you know, and we've seen that and like with many different community groups in Medford where like, you know, citizens and residents of the

209
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:48,542
of the city really can make a change in the city and voice what is important to us, which can feel really good in a time when on the scale of the country, everything is scary.

210
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,062
Yeah, yeah, in my school right now.

211
00:19:52,202 --> 00:19:53,883
So we're working on documentaries.

212
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:58,367
I'm making a documentary with my students on their own health journey.

213
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:06,172
We're learning about like movements that we can do and things we can eat and people and community.

214
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:07,433
We keep going back to that.

215
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:14,418
And I was showing them a documentary on the sit-ins in the South in the 60s.

216
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,861
And so, and it occurred to me, it's like they,

217
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:19,763
What did they do?

218
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:29,236
They went out into the community and refused to not connect, you know, and so I just feel that that there's some power in just

219
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:40,135
And obviously it wasn't a joyful time for them at that moment, but it became an opportunity that they connect now.

220
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,257
This is the way to do it.

221
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:44,819
You go into a community, you be part of that.

222
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:47,481
And I just thought that was really powerful.

223
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:51,705
I was like, just sitting in a place is powerful, even if they don't want you there.

224
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:53,586
Yeah.

225
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:54,407
Yeah.

226
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:55,988
Oh, well, thank you so much.

227
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,871
And I'm excited to kind of learn more and maybe get involved in one of these meetups.

228
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:00,632
Yes.

229
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,993
And Danielle, you should come this summer.

230
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:06,836
I mean, who doesn't love kickball and having a mermaid party?

231
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:09,478
Like all those things can happen at the same place.

232
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,879
Yeah, it sounds awesome.

233
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:13,581
Well, thanks again.

234
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:14,402
Yeah.

235
00:21:14,502 --> 00:21:15,483
Thank you so much.

236
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,404
