00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:09,249
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a measure that I've been thinking about for quite some time.

163
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:18,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Just recently, we saw the change of the name of Dudley Square in Boston, and that was something that was kicked off by the City's Improvement Committee.

164
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,585
[SPEAKER_13]: And after looking into the City's Improvement Committee and the duties and functions that they have,

165
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:44,192
[SPEAKER_13]: and looking at the City of Medford and the roles and responsibilities that our various departments have, I thought that it might be a good idea for us to start a discussion about creating a City Beautification and Improvement Advisory Commission that can provide us with ideas and revenue requests to figure out ways that we can better our curb appeal for those that are coming to the community and better deliver city services here in the community.

166
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:50,333
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support the measure to send this to the city solicitor for a draft framework for future debate.

167
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:51,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

168
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:53,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello.

169
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:54,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

170
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:56,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

171
00:12:57,331 --> 00:13:07,479
[SPEAKER_08]: In my last few years on the council, one of my peers in the city was the curb appeal of how we look to other people.

172
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:18,427
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope this will be something that will take up all the, as we would say, the low-hanging fruit that is visible to people in the city.

173
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:21,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully we can have a more beautiful city.

174
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:23,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

175
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:26,936
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

176
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:27,737
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

177
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:29,078
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

178
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:29,978
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

179
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:34,182
[SPEAKER_15]: 2-0-007 offered by Councilor Knight.

180
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:41,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that representatives from the Evisource Pipeline Project appear before the City Council.

181
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:55,601
[SPEAKER_15]: on a no less than quarterly basis to provide updates and address community concerns surrounding the project and be it further resolved that the council requests the first of these meetings occur no later than the first week of February.

182
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

183
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

184
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:00,425
[SPEAKER_13]: This is something that's rather self-explanatory.

185
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marksley should actually be included as a co-sponsor on this.

186
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:05,388
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a measure that we discussed in previous session.

187
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:09,927
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something that's very important to this community, and it's something that I think we should keep on the forefront going forward.

188
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:22,992
[SPEAKER_13]: We have about a 3.5-mile-long gas pipeline that's going to be stretching down Mystic Gap, down South Street, underneath the Mystic River, through our community garden, up Winthrop Street, down past Medford High School, all the way to the Winchester border, and then continue on into Woburn.

189
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:25,133
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be a very large construction project.

190
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:29,915
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to cause a number of disruptions to traffic, to traffic flow, to quality of life for residents in the neighborhood.

191
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:33,276
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we keep people informed.

192
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:36,658
[SPEAKER_13]: We did something very similar with the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

193
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:51,528
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a lot of concern about the future of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, and through the good work of friends from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital that are here this evening, actually, to witness our first meeting with our two new Councilors, we were able to garner some community support for the project, address the number of concerns that came up.

194
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:54,150
[SPEAKER_13]: and come up with a project that actually worked for everybody.

195
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:09,704
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, I'm hoping that we can do the same for this Eversource Pipeline project and create an open and transparent line of communication between us and the project managers and project development teams so that we can address some of these quality of life issues that are gonna be inevitable with a project of this size.

196
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:11,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

197
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:16,930
[SPEAKER_15]: If for the first time I'd like to recognize one of our newest councilors, Councilor Bears.

198
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

199
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:23,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to commend my colleagues for bringing this forward.

200
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:28,094
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essential for public safety, seeing what happened in North Andover, Andover, and Lawrence, that they get this right.

201
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:33,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And even more importantly, I'd like to see climate crisis mitigation, make sure that this pipeline isn't leaking gas.

202
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:37,578
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the last thing Medford needs to be doing is adding more natural gas to the atmosphere.

203
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:37,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

204
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:39,439
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

205
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,681
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Bears.

206
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:45,482
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

207
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:45,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

208
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:46,882
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

209
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:48,063
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

210
00:15:49,520 --> 00:16:11,665
[SPEAKER_15]: 2 0 dash 0 0 8 offered by consulate night be resolved that the medford city council requests that the city traffic engineer take the necessary steps to address the signal timing issues on harvard street between main street and mystic avenue that are causing traffic flow in congestion problems console night mr. President thank you very much maybe in

211
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:21,487
[SPEAKER_13]: A little before August, at the end of Harvard Street at Mystic Avenue, the left-hand lane was turned into a left-turn only lane.

212
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:31,146
[SPEAKER_13]: And since that time, there's been some changes to the signalization of the lights further down Route 16, but those changes haven't made their way all the way up Harvard Street.

213
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:34,947
[SPEAKER_13]: So what happens, Mr. President, is if you were coming from, oh, say, St.

214
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:47,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Clemens Church after your kids' basketball game last Saturday morning at 10 o'clock, and you drove down Harvard Street, and you passed the intersection of Main Street, and then you'd get right past Main Street and be stuck in traffic.

215
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:50,293
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the light on,

216
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Me and Harvard and Willis would change green, but the light on Mystic Ave wouldn't.

217
00:16:55,763 --> 00:16:57,484
[SPEAKER_13]: So the traffic wouldn't go anywhere.

218
00:16:57,705 --> 00:17:04,932
[SPEAKER_13]: The light would turn red, then the light would turn green between Willis and Harvard, I mean Willis and Mystic, and the cars would proceed.

219
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:09,156
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's really just an engineering issue, a signal timing issue that needs to be addressed.

220
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:14,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, I'd like to see that left-hand lane go back to the way that it was originally, where it was a straight or left.

221
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:23,089
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's my understanding that the state DOT put those restrictions in as a result of some of the construction traffic mitigation that was surrounding the casino project.

222
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:34,459
[SPEAKER_13]: But based upon the numbers that we've seen at the casino and the underperformance that we've seen at these casinos based upon their estimates versus their actual returns, I think that it might be something that we can look at in changing that back, Mr. President.

223
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:39,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think any of us have really felt the big impact of traffic since the casinos opened here in the city of Medford.

224
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:48,171
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that some of these issues that are, you know, affecting our neighborhood's traffic flow and congestion can really be addressed through an engineering study in the timing of lights.

225
00:17:48,631 --> 00:18:00,202
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we spoke about South Street and Main Street and the smart lights that we might be able to put there and the large cost that comes along with those to create a situation where we have smart lights that go through our squares.

226
00:18:01,003 --> 00:18:03,044
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the price tag was somewhere around $5 million.

227
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:12,291
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that engineering study or at least the very least the city engineer taking a look at this doing a traffic count and coming up with a Long-term solution for the residents in the neighborhood would be beneficial.

228
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:21,037
[SPEAKER_15]: So I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution Thank You councillor night on the motion of council and I second my council Caraviello councillor marks

229
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:23,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank my council colleague for bringing this up.

230
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:32,813
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, as he just alluded to, South and Main Street, that intersection has been in discussion with this council for as long as I've been on the council.

231
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:43,624
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe we're at a bypass at this particular point because the state is saying that in order to do the signalization, you'll need to start from South Street and work your way all the way back.

232
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:46,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to cost them millions of dollars to do this.

233
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:55,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, I believe it was three or four days ago, there was a major, major accident at that very intersection in the city.

234
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:59,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happens almost daily from what I hear from residents.

235
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask again, as you know, we asked our state delegation

236
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,641
[SPEAKER_02]: to meet with DOT and so forth.

237
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:30,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Councilor Scott Pell has been very active in this issue, but to be quite frank, there's been very little movement, and even some of the issues that we spoke about, about adding possibly a raised crosswalk, adding some additional signage, things that don't really take into consideration the signalization that they're talking about, and would provide some increased safety in the area.

238
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,890
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at putting

239
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:38,296
[SPEAKER_02]: a brand new police station across the street, and it's one of the most dangerous areas in the city.

240
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:42,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and there's nothing being done to the surrounding infrastructure.

241
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:53,070
[SPEAKER_02]: We're spending millions of dollars on a new building, a new facility, but I wouldn't tell any residents to walk there because I don't trust crossing either way.

242
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:55,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a major concern.

243
00:19:56,313 --> 00:20:08,461
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask that as part of this recommendation that we also get an update from our state delegation and the Department of Transportation where we stand with the signalization on south of Maine, Mr. President.

244
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:11,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilman Marks.

245
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:13,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

246
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:15,412
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate Councilor Marks bringing that up.

247
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:25,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a lengthy discussion with Representative Donato right after our inauguration and it's been very frustrating.

248
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:35,297
[SPEAKER_10]: He has been working very hard to try to set up a meeting not only for the Salton Main but also for the residents that are looking for the sound barrier over on

249
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:43,872
[SPEAKER_10]: So the frustrating piece that he relayed to me was that

250
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:55,176
[SPEAKER_10]: The conversations will start back up, and we would call for a meeting first thing after the holiday because of scheduling concerns with the people from DOT.

251
00:20:55,196 --> 00:20:56,316
[SPEAKER_10]: So this has been very frustrating.

252
00:20:56,656 --> 00:21:03,878
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that we talked about as part of our discussion, that I would put forth a resolution next week.

253
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:05,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad you did it this week.

254
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:06,318
[SPEAKER_10]: We could just add it through.

255
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:09,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I was giving the representative

256
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:16,531
[SPEAKER_10]: His due diligence, he was meeting with them this week, and then hopefully he's calling for a meeting on next week.

257
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:19,477
[SPEAKER_10]: So the sooner the better.

258
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:21,020
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate bringing that forward.

259
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:29,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is something that we keep saying, until someone dies at that intersection is when you're going to see something happen.

260
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:43,749
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I could just follow that up with a B paper, if I can, and jump ahead and ask our new mayor and our police chief, I think a lot of the low hanging fruit can be

261
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,032
[SPEAKER_10]: accompanied here and followed up here with our traffic department.

262
00:21:50,512 --> 00:22:02,157
[SPEAKER_10]: So raised sidewalk, illuminated stop signs, painting on some of those streets, we can have our department do that right away.

263
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:06,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we're waiting for the state, obviously they've dragged their feet.

264
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:11,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that we're also looking for the stop sign further up South Street.

265
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:15,423
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe at Toro, and that hasn't been done yet either.

266
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:28,568
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we can just follow that up with a letter to the mayor, administration, and the chief of police, that we look into that, and hopefully they can report back to us with some of those traffic calming measures.

267
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:29,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

268
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:30,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

269
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:36,572
[SPEAKER_15]: And for the first time, I'd like to recognize one of our other newest councilors, Councilor Morell.

270
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:38,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

271
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:47,419
[SPEAKER_11]: To really kind of echo what Councilor Marks was saying, when we look at these signaling issues, making sure we're thinking beyond the cars, there are people on foot, they're on bikes.

272
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,422
[SPEAKER_11]: And as traffic builds up, people tend to make hasty decisions that make it even more tricky for people to get through crosswalks, to get through on bikes.

273
00:22:53,442 --> 00:22:58,444
[SPEAKER_11]: So just ensure that we're looking at really a holistic approach to safety in these intersections.

274
00:22:59,045 --> 00:22:59,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

275
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:03,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

276
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:04,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

277
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:12,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to follow up, Mr. President, and I've been saying this for years, and I know some people don't like when I say it, but I'm going to continue to say it.

278
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,085
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a number of state roads in this community.

279
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:23,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we reach out as a council or the mayor reaches out, we expect to at least get a response in a timely manner.

280
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not happening.

281
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,192
[SPEAKER_02]: South Street's a perfect example.

282
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:28,633
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been waiting 10 years

283
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:33,857
[SPEAKER_02]: probably even over 10 years, to get some type of relief there.

284
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:35,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's yet to come.

285
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:51,052
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, if we as a community deem this as a public safety hazard, which we know we've received reports from the chief of the hundreds of accidents at that particular intersection, we should be able to intervene as a city and say, enough's enough.

286
00:23:51,493 --> 00:23:55,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if it's a state road, a federal road, or a road from whoever.

287
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,740
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take care of it on behalf of our residents and our community.

288
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just that area, Mr. President.

289
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,223
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Elm Street.

290
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:04,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Middlesex Ave.

291
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:10,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sidewalks that the state refuses to come in and fix that's a trip and fall hazard.

292
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:17,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's trees that they refuse to trim on their property that happen to be in front of people's homes that pay taxes in this community.

293
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:23,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I live in one of these streets that are a state road, I'm paying taxes to the city.

294
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:33,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very difficult to tell a resident, well, sorry, we as a city can't do anything, even though you're paying taxes to us, we have to wait for the state to step in.

295
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:39,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's about time that we step in, Mr. President, and start making some of these changes.

296
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And let the cods fall where they may be.

297
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:44,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the state get upset about it.

298
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:57,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that'll create a new story, Mr. President, like you see happening now in the news, where some cities and towns are unable to fix these giant potholes and so forth, and some of these state roads, and the inaction.

299
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a major concern, Mr. President.

300
00:25:00,475 --> 00:25:06,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired of wasting time, to be quite frank, talking about the same issue year after year after year.

301
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:09,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And salt in Maine is a major, major concern.

302
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:13,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will be the year that we act, one way or another.

303
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:16,311
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do something, Mr. President.

304
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:17,973
[SPEAKER_02]: We just can't keep on talking about it.

305
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it was a major accident.

306
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:25,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe there has been a fatality over there in the last several years as well, a pedestrian fatality.

307
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:27,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is well documented.

308
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:31,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanna put that in again, Mr. President.

309
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,720
[SPEAKER_02]: These are our roads and streets.

310
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:42,086
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be state under state jurisdiction, but they're our roads and our streets, our residents are crossing them, our residents are driving on them, and we have to maintain safety.

311
00:25:42,427 --> 00:25:46,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the state's not willing to do anything, then we have to step up as a community.

312
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:47,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

313
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:49,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

314
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:53,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Bears.

315
00:25:54,505 --> 00:25:55,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

316
00:25:55,506 --> 00:25:57,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say two things.

317
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,208
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I think South and Maine, we need to address it.

318
00:25:59,228 --> 00:26:02,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think Councilor Knight's original motion, we need to address that.

319
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been also stuck in that traffic.

320
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:06,654
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am also a resident of a state road.

321
00:26:06,894 --> 00:26:07,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on Fellsway West.

322
00:26:07,854 --> 00:26:10,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on a DCR road, not a MassDOT road.

323
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:16,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think something we as a council need to think about and talk to our state delegation about is that DCR is deeply underfunded.

324
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:18,382
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not getting the money they need.

325
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:20,043
[SPEAKER_01]: They're patching things together.

326
00:26:20,063 --> 00:26:22,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone's driven up by spot pawn, but they've been fixing the

327
00:26:23,463 --> 00:26:28,747
[SPEAKER_01]: the road around Spot Pond for like two years, and I'm assuming it's because they don't have enough money to hire construction crews.

328
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:39,113
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something I think the council should explore, look at, as well as just speaking with our state delegation about how we can make sure that our state agencies have the funding they need to actually provide the services that we deserve.

329
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:40,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

330
00:26:44,197 --> 00:26:44,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Castagnetti.

331
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,179
[SPEAKER_15]: One minute, please.

332
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrew Castagnetti, Mefford, Massachusetts.

333
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:58,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations, politicians, and I wish you great success and good health.

334
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:00,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

335
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:10,663
[SPEAKER_09]: On the subject of Salton Main Street, when I first received my license a while back, many decades, it's been a problem since then.

336
00:27:10,823 --> 00:27:16,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad the council is still trying to find a solution to this problem.

337
00:27:16,664 --> 00:27:21,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe a few years back, I brought up the Chief Sacco,

338
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:48,402
[SPEAKER_09]: the crime watch meetings, and also to Chief Buckley, can't we just erect the $100 sign that you probably have at the DPW yard, one on each side, as you're coming off of South onto Main, and have it be right turn only, not go across towards Route 93, not go into the middle of Main Street to take a left into Medford Square,

339
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:55,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe Chief Buckley says, Andrew, it's going to happen, a few months ago.

340
00:27:56,982 --> 00:28:00,484
[SPEAKER_09]: And for some reason, I guess it did not go forward.

341
00:28:01,324 --> 00:28:04,986
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess there's no perfect solutions in this world.

342
00:28:05,406 --> 00:28:14,950
[SPEAKER_09]: However, is it possible to put the $100 sign up, times two, and have an officer at that corner during rush hour times, especially?

343
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:25,609
[SPEAKER_09]: At least for a three-month or six-month trial basis, what we got to lose, we probably have a lot to save.

344
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Just an idea that I'm rehashing.

345
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:30,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for listening.

346
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:31,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Cascanetti.

347
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:50,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we'll take the B paper first offered by Councilor Scarpelli to receive updates from the traffic engineer with regard to the safety improvements that were recommended previously.

348
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:55,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

349
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,767
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

350
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:03,148
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

351
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:04,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Opposed?

352
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:05,169
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

353
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:13,674
[SPEAKER_15]: On the main resolution offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Marks.

354
00:29:13,694 --> 00:29:23,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you have an amendment, or I know Councilor Scarpelli, I think, Councilor Scarpelli gave an update, so I wasn't sure if, do you want me to leave that as amended, or?

355
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:32,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Marks.

356
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,360
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

357
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,441
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

358
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:35,562
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

359
00:29:42,008 --> 00:29:47,374
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Morell, to suspend the rules to take a paper out of order.

360
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:48,175
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

361
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:49,436
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

362
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,297
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

363
00:29:50,937 --> 00:29:52,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Communications from the Mayor.

364
00:29:54,287 --> 00:30:00,471
[SPEAKER_15]: 20-013, December 31st, 2019, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

365
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:17,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following home rule petition to be sent to the general court regarding certain funds and expenditures by the city of Medford received through its surrounding community agreement.

366
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:35,128
[SPEAKER_15]: homeowner petition, an act of authorizing the city of Medford to utilize funds received from the surrounding community agreement entered into between the city of Medford and Windmass LLC for the purposes set forth in the agreement.

367
00:30:36,622 --> 00:30:53,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it hereby resolved that the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts enact this Home Rule petition to allow the City of Medford to utilize funds received from the Surrounded Community Agreement executed on April 11, 2014 between the City of Medford and Windmass, LLC.

368
00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:01,463
[SPEAKER_15]: or its surrounding, I'm sorry, or its successors or assigns for the purposes that are set forth in said agreement or as amended.

369
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:10,386
[SPEAKER_15]: To accomplish these purposes, the city of Medford is authorized without the necessity of any further approval to create a special revenue fund.

370
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:20,010
[SPEAKER_15]: The legislature may reasonably vary the form and substance of the requested legislation within the scope of the general objectives of this petition.

371
00:31:20,787 --> 00:31:28,331
[SPEAKER_15]: be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in general court assembled and by the authority of the same as follows.

372
00:31:28,872 --> 00:31:37,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Section 1, notwithstanding any provision of the Massachusetts general laws or the provisions of any general law, special law, or regulation to the contrary,

373
00:31:38,357 --> 00:32:04,158
[SPEAKER_15]: The City of Medford, through the Mayor of the City of Medford, may, without further appropriation, utilize and expend all funds received by way of the surrounding community agreement executed on April 11, 2014, between the City of Medford and Windmass, LLC, or its successes or signs, for the purposes that are set forth in the said agreement or as amended.

374
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:05,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Section two.

375
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:11,817
[SPEAKER_15]: This act shall take effect upon its passage and shall be effective during the present fiscal year.

376
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:16,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Respectfully submitted, Mayor Stephanie M. Burke.

377
00:32:16,522 --> 00:32:19,366
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a representative from the administration here tonight.

378
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,503
[SPEAKER_12]: If you could please have your name and address for the record.

379
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:27,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Aleesha Nunley Benjamin, Finance Director for the City of Medford.

380
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Honorable City Councilors.

381
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:35,432
[SPEAKER_12]: This home rule petition will actually create a special revenue fund for the agreement.

382
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:39,996
[SPEAKER_12]: So the agreement actually specifies how the money is supposed to be by purpose.

383
00:32:41,197 --> 00:32:45,319
[SPEAKER_12]: The Department of Revenue never created a fund for it.

384
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:47,581
[SPEAKER_12]: It just left it as general fund revenue.

385
00:32:47,641 --> 00:32:55,445
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you know, any unused general fund revenue falls into free cash undesignated fund balance, which would be against the way the agreement is written.

386
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:57,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Those funds should be rolled over for those purposes.

387
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:00,347
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why we're asking for a whole new petition.

388
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:03,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

389
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:07,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Bears.

390
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:08,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Director.

391
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:09,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for being here.

392
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:10,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick question.

393
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:15,925
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, without further appropriation, is that further appropriation by the general court or by this council?

394
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:17,846
[SPEAKER_12]: By this city council.

395
00:33:17,926 --> 00:33:18,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

396
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:21,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

397
00:33:22,728 --> 00:33:23,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

398
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:24,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Pitt, thank you very much.

399
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:28,630
[SPEAKER_13]: So with the adoption of this homework petition, what we're saying is that

400
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:38,685
[SPEAKER_13]: This agreement that we've negotiated on April 11, 2014, the funds would not have to come before the council for appropriation when they're being spent?

401
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:39,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

402
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:48,050
[SPEAKER_13]: And it also says that any other successor agreement after this April 2014 agreement that negotiated between Wynne and the administration?

403
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,391
[SPEAKER_12]: If there's any successors, correct.

404
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:54,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

405
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:55,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Council Knight.

406
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:57,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, one more question.

407
00:33:57,084 --> 00:34:04,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a reason why we want to do it that way as opposed to the agreement at a time, why we want to give up blanket authority from now until the end of time?

408
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:12,788
[SPEAKER_12]: The way the state had set it up was each community that was impacted through the law had to have these agreements set up.

409
00:34:13,348 --> 00:34:20,070
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're just trying to make it so if they have to renegotiate with whoever, they don't have to go back to counsel again.

410
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say Wynn sold it to a different casino owner.

411
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Why come back just because it's a different casino owner?

412
00:34:26,603 --> 00:34:28,265
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's the meaning behind it.

413
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:42,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Or if a second successor agreement is entered into in the future to address community mitigation impacts, the benefits that are negotiated in that agreement would not be subject to appropriation by the council?

414
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:43,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

415
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,999
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be with the mayor.

416
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:45,441
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how it was set up from before.

417
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:46,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

418
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:46,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

419
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:47,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

420
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:48,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Council night.

421
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:50,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

422
00:34:53,037 --> 00:35:17,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Mr. President, when this agreement was signed in 2014, it's my understanding that money was earmarked by the mayor at the time for different needs in the community, one being public safety, one being road improvements, and I believe there was something in there for arts and so forth, but it spelled out the particular needs in the community

423
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:19,825
[SPEAKER_02]: and what this money would go towards.

424
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:40,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure if every member of the council is aware of this particular document, but I think it would be helpful to provide the council with the document itself and to make sure that the money, when it's being appropriated, especially if it's not gonna require a council approval, that we know what it's being earmarked to.

425
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:46,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you firsthand that road improvements and public safety should be a top priority

426
00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:50,215
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding this particular money.

427
00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:57,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would just ask, is that still the case that the money was earmarked to particular needs in the community?

428
00:35:58,058 --> 00:35:58,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct, yes.

429
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:00,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have that in front of you?

430
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:05,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and it's also a public document that's online, you could Google it.

431
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree, but it may be easier just maybe if we can.

432
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:12,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Could I give a copy to Larry, at least for, I brought with, in case anybody wanted to see some of the earmarks.

433
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:13,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if you can read off,

434
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:16,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have another copy to read off?

435
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:32,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you could just read off the needs, because there's some new members of the council, and I've been receiving a number of questions from different organizations in the community that said, geez, we thought that some of that money is supposed to be earmarked to arts or other needs in the community.

436
00:36:32,438 --> 00:36:34,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to be able to get back to these groups.

437
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:36,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, there's $125,000 community fund payment.

438
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:37,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

439
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:39,800
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's $325,000 transportation hub payment, $100,000 business athletics.

440
00:36:45,778 --> 00:36:52,766
[SPEAKER_12]: want $250,000 public safety, $100,000 for cultural fund, $100,000 for water transportation.

441
00:36:58,131 --> 00:37:02,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't received any of this money as of yet, because it was based on the opening, correct?

442
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:04,558
[SPEAKER_12]: It opened in the summer.

443
00:37:04,618 --> 00:37:06,020
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, we have received the money.

444
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,500
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

445
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And have we expended any money?

446
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:11,714
[SPEAKER_12]: They just made awards for the community fund.

447
00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:15,256
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't expended anything, but the awards have been made.

448
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:18,237
[SPEAKER_12]: So the payments haven't been made yet, but they're going to be.

449
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:20,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

450
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:26,180
[SPEAKER_02]: How will we know about a complete accounting for this every fiscal year?

451
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:29,794
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I want to have a special revenue fund that tracks it by category.

452
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:36,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would have a revolving fund set up by category with a budget for each amount that I expect to come in per year for me to track it.

453
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:38,875
[SPEAKER_12]: So will this now be included in the budget process?

454
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:43,516
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be in a, with this home rule petition, it would be in a special revenue fund so that I could track it.

455
00:37:43,536 --> 00:37:47,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenue fund, but will that also be part of the budgeting process?

456
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:48,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a part of the budgeting process.

457
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:50,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we make it part of the budgeting process?

458
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:51,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least every year we're

459
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:53,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at it?

460
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:58,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, because it's earmarked by a specific purpose, so we have to follow the purpose.

461
00:37:59,441 --> 00:37:59,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

462
00:37:59,981 --> 00:38:03,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure that that's being followed, especially where this is new.

463
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:04,262
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be followed.

464
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:05,542
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to be followed by agreement.

465
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:06,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

466
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:13,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I put on the agenda, it has to be over a year ago, money that was earmarked to the city that was supposed to go to the neighborhoods.

467
00:38:14,537 --> 00:38:19,538
[SPEAKER_02]: from Tufts University, they bought some air rights over the train tracks.

468
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:23,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time, the state didn't want to negotiate.

469
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:28,420
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, you can negotiate on our behalf regarding what you'd like to do with the money.

470
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:32,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've yet to get an accounting regarding, I think it was $425,000 or $500,000 on where that money has been spent.

471
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:44,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you provided something, but it didn't say what it was spent on, where it was spent.

472
00:38:44,468 --> 00:38:46,169
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't say if it was spent in the neighborhoods.

473
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,831
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't answer any of the questions.

474
00:38:49,432 --> 00:38:59,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, for that amount, I wasn't there at that time, but for the Neighborhood Cultural Fund that you're talking about for those funds, the way my accounting books are, it shows the vendor.

475
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,384
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't really tell me what neighborhood, so I couldn't give you that level of detail because I don't have it.

476
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:07,266
[SPEAKER_12]: But it doesn't even show you what was done.

477
00:39:08,686 --> 00:39:13,308
[SPEAKER_12]: You would have, whoever did the project or was running that project at that time would have to know that tracking.

478
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:14,648
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't there during that time.

479
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:15,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

480
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm saying as a council, if we wanted to look back and say the 500,000 that was earmarked to the city of method for these purposes, did they go to these purposes and what was actually done?

481
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:28,292
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't find that out.

482
00:39:29,553 --> 00:39:31,774
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's, but that is how you are correct.

483
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:32,954
[SPEAKER_12]: That is how it's supposed to be.

484
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:36,075
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the whole point of having a special revenue fund is to track it.

485
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:41,443
[SPEAKER_12]: exactly for what you're saying so that I can go back and say this is the purpose, this is why, this is how.

486
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:55,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you know, I'm not pointing this at you, but I'm just pointing for the future that it's helpful that we have the ability to go back and say we received X number of dollars, it was earmarked for this, and we'd like to make sure it was spent on this and what was actually done.

487
00:39:55,952 --> 00:39:59,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think moving forward, it's helpful to have those documents.

488
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:13,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, because we're not going to be responsible for the allocation anymore, I think at some process, and maybe even though it's not part of the budget process, that may be an ideal time to talk about these other accounts at that time to at least bring them up.

489
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:16,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we don't bring them up, no one's going to be the wiser.

490
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:20,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important that at least there's a second set of eyes taking a look at this.

491
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:21,906
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I want to bring up.

492
00:40:21,926 --> 00:40:28,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Through the President, I'd be happy to provide the City Council, if the City Council requests an annual report on expenditures.

493
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:30,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

494
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:31,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

495
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

496
00:40:33,048 --> 00:40:33,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilmarks.

497
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:34,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Morell.

498
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:35,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

499
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:41,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Have other cities in the surrounding community agreement, have they been through this process before and set up the same way, do you know?

500
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:47,633
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually attended the DOR's law seminar back in September.

501
00:40:48,252 --> 00:40:56,514
[SPEAKER_12]: And the DOR was actually the one that suggested to do a home rule petition, because right now, the way the law is stated, it's general fund revenue.

502
00:40:57,235 --> 00:41:00,215
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we didn't spend it all, it would just fall to the bottom line.

503
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:02,956
[SPEAKER_12]: So they had suggested I get a home rule petition.

504
00:41:03,276 --> 00:41:06,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if the other communities have done it or were the first to do it.

505
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:09,318
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going off of DOR's recommendation.

506
00:41:09,578 --> 00:41:10,218
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, thank you.

507
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:12,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

508
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:14,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Bears.

509
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:16,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

510
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Just another quick question.

511
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:19,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this agreement in perpetuity?

512
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how long does it go for?

513
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the schedule, it goes at least 26 years.

514
00:41:24,261 --> 00:41:34,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least that's what the payment schedule seems to me to suggest.

515
00:41:36,284 --> 00:41:38,865
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe as long as they're holding the license.

516
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:48,297
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would say yes, because there is not an expiration.

517
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:58,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just, this came to us from Mayor Burke, and I was just wondering if Mayor Lungo-Koehn had any, if you discussed this with the new administration, or if there's any, just coming through.

518
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have.

519
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,641
[SPEAKER_12]: I have discussed it with the chief of staff and the mayor, and they are in support.

520
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:04,601
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're in support, thank you.

521
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:06,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

522
00:42:06,302 --> 00:42:06,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

523
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:08,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

524
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:09,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears.

525
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:15,620
[SPEAKER_13]: spoke to something that was a concern of mine, which was the term of the agreement and the total dollar figure.

526
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:24,042
[SPEAKER_13]: At the conclusion of this agreement, it looks like it's going to be somewhere around 40 or 50 million bucks.

527
00:42:24,182 --> 00:42:36,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, if we have a community fund payment of $125,000, all it is is a direct cash payment of $125 to a thing called the community fund, which outlines what certain areas you can spend it on?

528
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:37,565
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a board.

529
00:42:38,443 --> 00:42:43,507
[SPEAKER_12]: that allocates that money, that awards that money for certain purposes, they've already started doing that.

530
00:42:44,348 --> 00:42:46,430
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what they've been using the community fund for.

531
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:54,936
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, my concern is this, is to give blanket authority to the administration for the spending of the upwards of $50 million without council appropriation.

532
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,162
[SPEAKER_13]: And to grant this authority for a period of time that exceeds three decades.

533
00:43:02,802 --> 00:43:03,743
[SPEAKER_13]: That's concerning to me.

534
00:43:06,302 --> 00:43:11,524
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could keep it to the one agreement that we're currently in, I'd feel much more comfortable about it.

535
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:15,266
[SPEAKER_13]: And the successor agreements would be something that we'd have to take a look at.

536
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:26,350
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just think that to give blanket authority to spend $50 million without any council appropriation, as long as it falls within the

537
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:28,847
[SPEAKER_13]: the bucket, if I'm understanding this correct.

538
00:43:28,947 --> 00:43:35,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Transportation hub payment means that, you know, we got $425,000 for transportation related issues.

539
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,634
[SPEAKER_13]: It can be anything that we want to spend it on.

540
00:43:39,938 --> 00:43:44,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything transportation related or is it outlined and specified in an agreement or subject to a plan?

541
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,626
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I look at these funds and I say these funds are good funds to use for planning purposes.

542
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:53,363
[SPEAKER_13]: The money that we wouldn't have had otherwise without this agreement.

543
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:55,884
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is monies that we should be using for planning purposes.

544
00:43:55,904 --> 00:43:59,106
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're looking about transportation, let's figure out transportation planning.

545
00:43:59,126 --> 00:44:00,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's use that money to plan.

546
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:12,653
[SPEAKER_13]: But to have a blanket authority for a period of time of three decades and the ability to spend $50 million without a check and balance from the council is something that does raise a red flag in my opinion.

547
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,992
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there are terms and conditions.

548
00:44:15,073 --> 00:44:15,773
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't print that out.

549
00:44:15,813 --> 00:44:22,662
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on their website, but there is terms and conditions to how the money is to be expended, and it was signed off by the mayor.

550
00:44:22,682 --> 00:44:24,704
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just the way the state had created it.

551
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:31,372
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'd like the paper to be amended, as far as, like you said, you don't want to open for another agreement, I'm sure.

552
00:44:31,954 --> 00:44:37,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, I just don't think it's fair to saddle future councilors with this decision that we've made.

553
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:46,005
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no problem doing it with the body that's here right now, but 10 years or 15 years down the line, this decision's going to have already been made for somebody else.

554
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:49,027
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's something that I think we might also want to take a look at.

555
00:44:49,908 --> 00:44:51,590
[SPEAKER_13]: But I rest my case.

556
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,051
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate you for filling me in and raising my concerns.

557
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:55,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

558
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:57,014
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Bears.

559
00:44:57,854 --> 00:44:59,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to Councilor Knight's point,

560
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:05,582
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a lot of money over a long period of time.

561
00:45:05,642 --> 00:45:08,528
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as much in each year but over a long period of time it is.

562
00:45:08,888 --> 00:45:09,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the D.O.R.'

563
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:15,721
[SPEAKER_01]: 's recommendation that it be not subject to the appropriation of the council or

564
00:45:16,345 --> 00:45:22,688
[SPEAKER_12]: It's DOR's recommendation to do a whole new petition to make a special revenue fund because they didn't create any legislation for us.

565
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:28,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually they have whenever they do agreements like this, they usually say, oh, it's gonna be a stabilization.

566
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:32,653
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gonna be this kind of a fund like they did with our transportation network fees for Lyft.

567
00:45:32,673 --> 00:45:34,374
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this is what it's gonna be.

568
00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:35,234
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't do that.

569
00:45:35,874 --> 00:45:37,095
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just gonna.

570
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:40,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

571
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:43,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight, one minute please.

572
00:45:43,966 --> 00:45:46,187
[SPEAKER_13]: ride share fees are subject to appropriation, correct?

573
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, but they're also with the fund.

574
00:45:47,888 --> 00:45:50,230
[SPEAKER_12]: They designated the fund that we're supposed to be.

575
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,670
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't designate a fund.

576
00:45:51,831 --> 00:45:52,731
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just general fund.

577
00:45:53,712 --> 00:45:56,973
[SPEAKER_13]: So we could actually designate the fund, but still keep everything subject to appropriation.

578
00:45:57,434 --> 00:46:00,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, but if everything isn't expended, it falls down to free cash.

579
00:46:00,976 --> 00:46:02,557
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you're in violation of your agreement.

580
00:46:02,717 --> 00:46:04,058
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're in violation of our agreement?

581
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:06,259
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I wanted it as a special revenue fund.

582
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:07,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

583
00:46:10,361 --> 00:46:11,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

584
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:33,947
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's my understanding there's already an established committee which you happen to serve on correct, which is for the which yes That is correct, and that is for the community fund payment, which is only for I believe it's a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars correct it gets appropriated out to Grant applicants once a year, but that's every year too, so that's every year for an extended, and that's already underway and

585
00:46:34,327 --> 00:46:34,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

586
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:39,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, the money hasn't gone out, but the grants have been awarded as far as who received them.

587
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:43,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And that committee was established by the administration, right?

588
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,292
[SPEAKER_02]: The previous administration?

589
00:46:44,312 --> 00:46:44,613
[SPEAKER_02]: You are correct.

590
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:44,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

591
00:46:45,253 --> 00:46:45,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

592
00:46:45,713 --> 00:46:45,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

593
00:46:46,153 --> 00:46:50,956
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the, um, it's the, whoever is the council president is on there.

594
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:52,217
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor's on there.

595
00:46:52,657 --> 00:46:59,661
[SPEAKER_15]: The vice chair of the school committee, um, uh, Neil Osborne's on there as well.

596
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:02,102
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, there's a community representative as well.

597
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:02,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Aaron Rafferty.

598
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

599
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:23,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe similar to what's being done with that, we can maybe take a look and look at some of these other, like public safety and so forth, and do something similar, where it's not just a unilateral decision made by the administration, but comprised of a committee made up of maybe someone from the council and members of the community and department heads.

600
00:47:23,506 --> 00:47:25,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that may be a similar approach.

601
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:29,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I agree, I'm always one for checking balances.

602
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:36,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree that anything that would tie the hands of future Councilors, I would not support either.

603
00:47:37,633 --> 00:47:44,037
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that may be a good option to have this money, maybe the new administration

604
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:51,070
[SPEAKER_02]: set up additional committees for each of the different topics that were discussed.

605
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:57,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't forget the original agreement that was signed, I believe it was signed by Mayor McGlynn back in 2014, that was

606
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:09,648
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I was on the council, I don't remember any giant community outreach saying, hey community, how would you like to spend this million dollars a year for the next 50 years?

607
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:14,752
[SPEAKER_02]: That was done by the mayor when he negotiated this surrounding community agreement.

608
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was done in a vacuum, in my opinion.

609
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there wasn't a lot of outreach then.

610
00:48:20,611 --> 00:48:29,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe now the time is to bring in the community and say, what would we like to see this spent on, spent, how we'd like to see it spent.

611
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:31,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe our needs have changed.

612
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, they may change.

613
00:48:33,755 --> 00:48:39,257
[SPEAKER_02]: And are we subject to this particular framework?

614
00:48:40,132 --> 00:48:44,034
[SPEAKER_02]: for the next 50 years or are we able, do we have flexibility?

615
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's not a question for you.

616
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:50,278
[SPEAKER_12]: The administration would have flexibility where they could always go back and talk to when.

617
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:51,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

618
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:52,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

619
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:55,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so maybe, uh, those discussions can be had.

620
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:04,345
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in favor of doing whatever the council would like to do if, if they want to maybe include, uh, maybe just a two year span in the home rule petition.

621
00:49:05,286 --> 00:49:06,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're easy enough to file.

622
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:09,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and so that would only cover our term and,

623
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:11,449
[SPEAKER_02]: if we're agreeable to that.

624
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:14,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm open.

625
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

626
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:21,092
[SPEAKER_15]: So Councilor Bears, before the numerous points of information, you had the floor.

627
00:49:21,172 --> 00:49:21,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

628
00:49:21,612 --> 00:49:22,252
[SPEAKER_15]: So Councilor Bears.

629
00:49:22,812 --> 00:49:26,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't disagree with you, but a home rule petition isn't always an easy win.

630
00:49:26,574 --> 00:49:32,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe we have a change in state delegation and suddenly it's not as easy to get home rule petitions through.

631
00:49:32,756 --> 00:49:35,417
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess just back to the question,

632
00:49:37,445 --> 00:49:39,867
[SPEAKER_01]: You were saying that at the end of the year, it would go to free cash.

633
00:49:39,887 --> 00:49:48,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be possible for us to amend this to say that it's subject to appropriation of the council, and then could we send the money back to the fund for the next year, or is that not allowed with the special revenue funds?

634
00:49:48,874 --> 00:49:50,475
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it would just stay inside.

635
00:49:50,576 --> 00:49:54,599
[SPEAKER_12]: So if, let's say, we're just gonna use the community fund, I guess, as an example.

636
00:49:54,619 --> 00:50:00,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say we didn't have anybody apply for the award for that 125, and then we got another 125, so now we have 252 award.

637
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:02,925
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not like they're losing.

638
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:03,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

639
00:50:03,906 --> 00:50:10,591
[SPEAKER_01]: So so if we created the special revenue fund, but said we wanted the final things to be subject to preparation the council We wouldn't be in violation of the agreement.

640
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:11,212
[SPEAKER_01]: No great.

641
00:50:11,532 --> 00:50:12,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

642
00:50:12,673 --> 00:50:24,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you council appears Council night mr. President I'd like to make a motion to strike the words without further appropriation from section one of the homework petition that's been proposed and replace it with subject to appropriation I

643
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:45,905
[SPEAKER_13]: This would allow the flexibility to create the special revenue fund, to let it exist, to allow the monies to be put into the appropriate buckets of the special revenue fund, but when that money gets spent, it comes before the Council for Appropriation.

644
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:51,506
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't tie the hands of future councilors because any money that's being spent has to come before the Council for Appropriation.

645
00:50:51,886 --> 00:50:54,387
[SPEAKER_13]: It allows the administration to comply with the DOI directives.

646
00:50:54,487 --> 00:50:55,487
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a great compromise.

647
00:50:57,224 --> 00:51:05,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, on the motion to amend the agreement by Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Bears, Councilor Marks.

648
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:10,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a request for a home rule petition by the city administration.

649
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:11,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

650
00:51:11,898 --> 00:51:13,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is their home rule petition.

651
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:20,927
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't naturally just amend their petition, but what we can do is request that this amendment take place.

652
00:51:22,006 --> 00:51:26,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the mayor decides to make this change, then submit it back to us for a vote.

653
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:35,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we just have to make sure that what we're asking is that the administration changed the whole moon petition because it was initiated by the administration.

654
00:51:36,339 --> 00:51:42,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just want to make sure it's a request to, to, to request to amend these, this current document.

655
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:43,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

656
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:46,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the language, I agree with that.

657
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:46,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

658
00:51:52,678 --> 00:51:53,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello.

659
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:55,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

660
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:06,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there some type of agreement that the casino has to generate a certain amount of income for us to continue getting this award?

661
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:09,263
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

662
00:52:10,483 --> 00:52:13,124
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't say anything I don't believe about any kind of income.

663
00:52:15,493 --> 00:52:19,434
[SPEAKER_08]: So this award comes in whether they make money, lose money, or whatever, correct?

664
00:52:19,674 --> 00:52:20,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

665
00:52:20,215 --> 00:52:22,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is as long as Wynn has the license, correct?

666
00:52:22,915 --> 00:52:23,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

667
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:30,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Because as people know, they're not, the numbers being generated over there are not anyway what they thought they were going to be.

668
00:52:36,668 --> 00:52:36,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

669
00:52:36,948 --> 00:52:37,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

670
00:52:38,328 --> 00:52:44,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lanai, if I may, could you please clarify the language to the clerk?

671
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:44,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly.

672
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:46,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

673
00:52:48,531 --> 00:53:00,635
[SPEAKER_13]: It was to strike the word in section one that would say without further appropriation and replace that with subject to appropriation.

674
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:26,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Notwithstanding any provisions of Massachusetts general laws or the provisions of any general law special or regulation to the contrary, the city of Medford through the mayor of the city of Medford may strike without further appropriation, replace with subject to appropriation, utilize and expend all funds received by way of the surrounding community agreement et al.

675
00:53:27,943 --> 00:53:28,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

676
00:53:29,244 --> 00:53:32,507
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion, seconded by Councilor Bears.

677
00:53:35,402 --> 00:53:37,003
[SPEAKER_15]: A roll call vote has been requested.

678
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,603

00:54:23,976 --> 00:54:25,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

704
00:54:25,237 --> 00:54:32,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, as we shift gears into a new legislative session, I want to make sure that we keep on the forefront of our minds the brewery ordinance.

705
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,501
[SPEAKER_13]: This was something that we were almost crossing the finish line at at one point in time.

706
00:54:37,261 --> 00:54:38,022
[SPEAKER_13]: We got some

707
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:46,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Recommendations or requests, I guess, from a local business group in the community that was supposed to report back to us sometime in November about what they felt about this.

708
00:54:46,669 --> 00:54:48,971
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe that we've received anything at this point in time.

709
00:54:49,172 --> 00:54:50,413
[SPEAKER_15]: We have not received anything.

710
00:54:50,473 --> 00:54:52,094
[SPEAKER_15]: I will reach out to get an update from the chamber.

711
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:56,819
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been about 60 days since they said that they were going to report back to us on 11-7, Mr. President.

712
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:00,302
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm hoping that we can set this up for a further committee of the whole meeting and move forward on it.

713
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:01,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Council Knight.

714
00:55:01,889 --> 00:55:04,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we have not received an update from the Chamber.

715
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:10,294
[SPEAKER_15]: I can reach out to them to get an update and schedule a meeting as soon as possible.

716
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:14,136
[SPEAKER_15]: This is one of the items that we need to pick up from the last term.

717
00:55:17,187 --> 00:55:17,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morell.

718
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:19,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

719
00:55:19,388 --> 00:55:21,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just want to say that I support moving forward with this.

720
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:24,190
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I was with a group of people that stayed here very late.

721
00:55:24,631 --> 00:55:30,874
[SPEAKER_11]: One July night, I believe it was, around 11 p.m., very excitedly speaking in favor of Brewery, including at least one councilor.

722
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,855
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just excited to see this moving forward.

723
00:55:33,035 --> 00:55:33,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

724
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:35,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

725
00:55:36,228 --> 00:55:36,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

726
00:55:37,028 --> 00:55:44,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, as we move forward on this, I still haven't seen the law that allows us to serve alcohol without food.

727
00:55:45,456 --> 00:55:53,963
[SPEAKER_08]: According to our law of the city of Medford, you can only dispense alcohol in facilities that have a common victuals license.

728
00:55:55,024 --> 00:55:58,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a vote taken by the people, not by this council.

729
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:01,830
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know when the rule is changed.

730
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:05,368
[SPEAKER_08]: to allow alcohol to be poured without food.

731
00:56:07,288 --> 00:56:20,691
[SPEAKER_08]: So, again, as we move forward on this, Mr. President, this needs to be clarified, because this is a whole new liquor license that we have not, the CF method is not approved.

732
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello, would you like to amend this to get an update from the city solicitor's office?

733
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:25,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I would.

734
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:25,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

735
00:56:26,913 --> 00:56:28,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

736
00:56:30,874 --> 00:56:31,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

737
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:33,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

738
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:56,207
[SPEAKER_02]: At many of the meetings that we had regarding the brewery ordinance, Allie Fisk from the city administration was one of the leads from the city side, and I believe she also served as the Liquor Commission's secretary of that commission, and she was very instrumental in getting some information for us and so forth.

739
00:56:56,567 --> 00:57:01,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ask, Mr. President, whatever meeting that we do have, that we invite members of the Liquor Commission

740
00:57:02,088 --> 00:57:06,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And they may be able to also shed some light with Councilor Caraviello just alluded to.

741
00:57:08,151 --> 00:57:15,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe we can move forward with all this information if we get it all around the table at the same time.

742
00:57:15,255 --> 00:57:15,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds good.

743
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:16,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

744
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:24,140
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Bears, as amended by Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Marks.

745
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,500
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

746
00:57:25,761 --> 00:57:25,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

747
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:26,721
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

748
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:27,922
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

749
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:47,975
[SPEAKER_15]: 20-010 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence in memory of Governor's Councilor Michael J. Callahan, a dedicated public servant who passed on January 6, 2011, following five decades of public service to the people of Medford.

750
00:57:48,456 --> 00:57:52,838
[SPEAKER_15]: It be it further resolved that this evening's council meeting be dedicated in his memory.

751
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:56,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

752
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

753
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:03,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

754
00:58:03,388 --> 00:58:11,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Michael Callahan was a lifelong Medford resident, famous across the Fulton Heights area of the city particularly.

755
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:16,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Grew up on Saunders Street, was a paper boy in the area for a number of years.

756
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:21,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Moved on to Salem Street and took care of his elderly mother who was suffering from dementia for a number of years.

757
00:58:22,158 --> 00:58:27,484
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a Vietnam veteran, an aide to Senators Bullock and McKenner, both who represented Medford at one portion of the time.

758
00:58:28,185 --> 00:58:30,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Assistant Commissioner of Racing, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

759
00:58:31,489 --> 00:58:34,172
[SPEAKER_13]: The founder and chairman of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission.

760
00:58:34,893 --> 00:58:44,156
[SPEAKER_13]: He was elected to the Governor's Council in 1998 and presided over the appointment of over 500 judges and clerks across the Commonwealth, Mr. President.

761
00:58:45,016 --> 00:58:52,459
[SPEAKER_13]: He had 50 years of public service under his belt upon his passing, all during the which time he resided in the city of Medford.

762
00:58:53,799 --> 00:58:56,660
[SPEAKER_13]: If you go up to Wright's Pond, Mr. President, you'll see a monument.

763
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:01,065
[SPEAKER_13]: dedicated to Councilor Callaghan, or Mikey C as we called him.

764
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:14,340
[SPEAKER_13]: And legend has it that back in the early 80s when development was booming in the city of Medford and condos were going up all across the city, there were plans to take Wrights Pond and develop Wrights Pond into a condominium complex.

765
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,862
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mike Callaghan led the charge.

766
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:29,259
[SPEAKER_13]: to save Rights Pond, and back in 2014, fittingly, Mayor McGlynn dedicated a portion of Rights Pond in Michael Callahan's memory for the work that he did in saving Rights Pond and preserving it from overdevelopment.

767
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Michael, like I said, was a mentor to me.

768
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:35,203
[SPEAKER_13]: I learned a lot about government and the way government works from Michael Callahan.

769
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:37,064
[SPEAKER_13]: He was someone that I spent a great deal of time with.

770
00:59:37,444 --> 00:59:41,008
[SPEAKER_13]: and someone that I was very glad to call a friend, very lucky to have as a friend.

771
00:59:41,989 --> 00:59:50,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And every year since I've been elected to the council, I've brought this up right around the time of his passing to commemorate the service that he's provided to the people of Medford and to be sure that these are remembered.

772
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:53,141
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.

773
00:59:53,702 --> 00:59:54,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

774
00:59:56,578 --> 01:00:08,590
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of council night, if we could at this point, if we could all please rise for a brief moment of silence as we remember Michael Callahan and dedicate this meeting tonight in his memory.

775
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,942
[SPEAKER_15]: 20-011 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

776
01:00:35,162 --> 01:00:42,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Max Stevens, a member of the American Deaf Olympic team for winning the gold medal in Italy.

777
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:52,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it further resolved that we invite Max and his family to the next meeting to present him with a council citation.

778
01:00:53,455 --> 01:00:54,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello.

779
01:00:54,336 --> 01:00:55,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

780
01:00:55,096 --> 01:01:01,881
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you who are following, Max and his team went to Italy, and they won a gold medal.

781
01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:03,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Max got two goals.

782
01:01:03,422 --> 01:01:10,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was also the youngest member of the team to play with a lot of men that were 25 and 35 years old.

783
01:01:10,547 --> 01:01:16,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's this young kid playing with all these world-class athletes.

784
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,593
[SPEAKER_08]: And he did his city and his family proud.

785
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,755
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like to have him come here next week for a council citation.

786
01:01:23,303 --> 01:01:24,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

787
01:01:25,284 --> 01:01:31,487
[SPEAKER_15]: I've met Max before, a fine young man, and we will invite him to a meeting so we can give him a council citation.

788
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:34,829
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

789
01:01:34,849 --> 01:01:35,530
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

790
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:36,670
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

791
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,592
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

792
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:50,658
[SPEAKER_15]: 20-012, offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the green bike that has been at the corner of Harvard Avenue and Mystic River Road be removed from the street.

793
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:52,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello.

794
01:01:59,313 --> 01:02:06,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this a wine bike or an actual green bike?

795
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Morell.

796
01:02:35,062 --> 01:02:37,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty sure it's a lime bike I just drove by last night.

797
01:02:37,323 --> 01:02:38,064
[SPEAKER_15]: It is, okay.

798
01:02:38,184 --> 01:02:44,968
[SPEAKER_15]: I wasn't sure if it was part of the lime bike program or if it was just a random green bike.

799
01:02:45,068 --> 01:02:46,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, sounds good.

800
01:02:47,009 --> 01:02:48,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for clarifying.

801
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:52,973
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Morell.

802
01:02:52,993 --> 01:02:53,813
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

803
01:02:54,154 --> 01:02:54,834
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

804
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:55,635
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

805
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:07,276
[SPEAKER_15]: 19-667 offered by Council and I Whereas Medford City Hall closes on Wednesday evening at 730, you know Friday afternoon at 1230 and whereas the open meeting Okay

806
01:03:23,325 --> 01:03:26,733
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Caraviello to waive the reading.

807
01:03:26,753 --> 01:03:28,698
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor, all those opposed.

808
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:31,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

809
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:32,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

810
01:03:32,794 --> 01:03:36,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, what this proposal is, is it's a request to move a meeting night from Tuesday to Wednesday.

811
01:03:37,698 --> 01:03:43,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently, pursuant to the open meeting law, absent weekends and holidays, you need 48 hours prior to your meeting to post.

812
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:59,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Because our meetings are on Tuesday, that requires the city of Medford, city clerk, to post our council meetings on Friday before the close of business at 1230, which means that we need to, as councilors, get our resolutions to the city clerk by Friday morning at 9 a.m.

813
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:11,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, the majority of us in this community that go out on the weekends, take your kids to basketball practice, go down to the coffee shop, take a jog, whatever it may be, run into a lot of people in the community.

814
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:16,098
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people that have requests for services, a lot of people that have questions and concerns about what's going on.

815
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:34,835
[SPEAKER_13]: What ends up happening a lot of the time, Mr. President, is that those questions and concerns that arise over the weekend before the Tuesday meeting don't make it on the agenda because on Friday we have to get everything by 9 o'clock so that the city clerk can produce the agenda by 1230 on Friday afternoon before the close of business and before his staff leaves.

816
01:04:35,635 --> 01:04:50,400
[SPEAKER_13]: That coupled with the fact, it's my understanding, that because of that short time frame, on Friday morning, the staff is, it's very hectic in the clerk's office on Friday mornings to get this agenda out because of the number of items that are coming in at the 11th hour.

817
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:55,122
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if you figure that the council meets on a Tuesday night and we have a very late meeting, it goes till 11.

818
01:04:56,062 --> 01:04:57,583
[SPEAKER_13]: We all wake up the next morning, go to work.

819
01:04:58,063 --> 01:05:02,426
[SPEAKER_13]: We come back to the City Hall for a Committee of the Whole meeting on a Wednesday, and that goes for a couple hours.

820
01:05:02,926 --> 01:05:03,886
[SPEAKER_13]: We work until 8 o'clock.

821
01:05:04,086 --> 01:05:04,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we all go home.

822
01:05:05,347 --> 01:05:06,268
[SPEAKER_13]: We go to work the next day.

823
01:05:06,308 --> 01:05:07,588
[SPEAKER_13]: It's already Thursday, Mr. President.

824
01:05:08,729 --> 01:05:11,911
[SPEAKER_13]: So it gives us very little time to place items on the agenda.

825
01:05:12,351 --> 01:05:19,055
[SPEAKER_13]: That coupled with the fact that during the last term, nearly one in four resolutions that were filed by councilors were filed under suspension.

826
01:05:20,656 --> 01:05:23,820
[SPEAKER_13]: We're here talking about transparency, the need for transparent government.

827
01:05:24,641 --> 01:05:33,573
[SPEAKER_13]: We're putting cameras in our meeting rooms, but when one-fourth of the items that the council actually discusses aren't showing up on the agenda, are we truly being transparent?

828
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:54,166
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was my thinking, Mr. President, because I know it's a problem for me sometimes to get items on the agenda based upon the short time frame we have from Tuesday to Friday morning, and then I go out into the community and I participate in community events and family events and the like, and I get inundated with questions, concerns, and calls, and we try to address those things, but sometimes they need to make their way to the agenda.

829
01:05:54,808 --> 01:06:00,236
[SPEAKER_13]: And when they make their way to the agenda, they're doing so under suspension, and they're not showing up on the council agenda.

830
01:06:00,577 --> 01:06:06,366
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought that this might be a way that we could stem some of the under suspension resolutions that were being filed here at the council.

831
01:06:07,059 --> 01:06:09,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Allow the city clerk's office to have a little bit of breathing room.

832
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Allow the council to have a little bit more time to put items on the agenda.

833
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:19,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, Mr. President, I have always said that I can do my homework a lot better if I know what I'm going to be studying.

834
01:06:20,682 --> 01:06:23,783
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's an issue that's on the agenda and I know about it, I can study it.

835
01:06:24,243 --> 01:06:27,964
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's an issue that's not on the agenda that's coming up at the meeting, we're all walking in blind.

836
01:06:28,564 --> 01:06:40,154
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm hoping that you know with the move of the meetings from Tuesday nights to Wednesday nights It will allow us the opportunity to number one have the building have City Council meetings on nights that City Hall is already open late City Hall is open for business on Wednesday evening.

837
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:50,063
[SPEAKER_13]: So from a facilities standpoint from a you know environmental standpoint I open in the building up every Tuesday night to turn the heat on for the council meetings where it's already going to be on on a Wednesday night anyway and

838
01:06:50,443 --> 01:07:01,489
[SPEAKER_13]: And the fact that department heads are in the building on Wednesday nights already and will allow us an ease of scheduling if we have committees of the whole or we have matters that are before us here, we can get them here by request on Wednesday nights where they're already here late.

839
01:07:02,109 --> 01:07:13,476
[SPEAKER_13]: So from an operational and functional standpoint of government, Mr. President, I thought it made sense from the side of things where everybody talks about what can we do to get more people involved in the city council meetings and come into the city council chambers.

840
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:15,116
[SPEAKER_13]: City Hall is open on Wednesdays.

841
01:07:15,137 --> 01:07:17,678
[SPEAKER_13]: People are here paying their tax bill, attending other meetings.

842
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:19,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Now the council meeting is open too.

843
01:07:19,279 --> 01:07:20,079
[SPEAKER_13]: They're just passing by.

844
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:25,942
[SPEAKER_13]: They might want to come in and pop in and be curious and explore a little bit more about what the city council has to say here in all the chambers.

845
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:42,470
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really something that I put forward for transparency purposes, Mr. President, to ensure that we as councils have ample opportunity to place things on the agenda, that the items that are being placed on the agenda are visible and noticed to the public and to our council colleagues so that we can do our homework.

846
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,272
[SPEAKER_13]: and come prepared to the meeting, or better prepared to the meeting.

847
01:07:46,392 --> 01:07:55,621
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that this isn't going to stop all in the suspension resolutions, but what it is going to do, I think, is give us a little bit of extra time to put items on the agenda to be a little bit more transparent and a little bit more open.

848
01:07:56,392 --> 01:07:58,733
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where I'm coming from with it, Mr. President.

849
01:07:59,394 --> 01:08:01,535
[SPEAKER_13]: It's six of one, half a dozen of the other.

850
01:08:01,795 --> 01:08:03,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm ready to come to work any night.

851
01:08:03,836 --> 01:08:08,538
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just bringing this forward for the simple purpose that we file an inordinate number of resolutions under suspension.

852
01:08:08,878 --> 01:08:18,922
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think with the move of the meeting from Tuesday to Wednesday will allow us an exceeding period of time for us to file resolutions and get them out there with the same 48 hour notice that's required under the open meeting law.

853
01:08:20,043 --> 01:08:20,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

854
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

855
01:08:22,804 --> 01:08:23,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

856
01:08:26,012 --> 01:08:29,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think that here we are, our first meeting together in a new term.

857
01:08:29,813 --> 01:08:34,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's an innovative approach.

858
01:08:34,334 --> 01:08:43,137
[SPEAKER_10]: And since Councilor Knight brought this up, I've reached out to our colleagues in neighboring communities.

859
01:08:43,817 --> 01:08:46,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not far-fetched.

860
01:08:46,317 --> 01:08:48,158
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what most communities do, by the way.

861
01:08:49,518 --> 01:08:55,060
[SPEAKER_10]: They hold their council meetings the same evenings that the city halls are open.

862
01:08:56,052 --> 01:09:08,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I think one big change that might have been overlooked when we changed the hours of city hall employees is that city hall closes at 1230 on Fridays.

863
01:09:08,767 --> 01:09:10,309
[SPEAKER_10]: So you eliminate half of a day.

864
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:15,174
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's an important day for the fact of the open meeting law and when

865
01:09:17,184 --> 01:09:18,565
[SPEAKER_10]: information has to be disseminated.

866
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:32,097
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that you bring some great points, something that I'm thinking heavily on supporting, but I could see where there are benefits to moving the day.

867
01:09:32,117 --> 01:09:34,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Council Knight says, I'm ready to work any night.

868
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:36,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's important, but

869
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,596
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think change is pretty good, too.

870
01:09:41,876 --> 01:09:43,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And you bring up some great points.

871
01:09:43,497 --> 01:09:59,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And like, again, I talked to some colleagues in neighboring communities, and they find it to see that they don't have as many resolutions coming in in the format that we're seeing here in Method, one of every four.

872
01:09:59,543 --> 01:10:04,685
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's the transparency piece is important.

873
01:10:06,155 --> 01:10:09,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I applaud you for making that effort, and we'll see where the votes lie.

874
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:10,279
[SPEAKER_10]: So, thank you.

875
01:10:12,502 --> 01:10:13,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

876
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:15,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Bears.

877
01:10:16,506 --> 01:10:17,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

878
01:10:17,807 --> 01:10:20,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I hear the arguments, and I don't discount them at all.

879
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:27,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of reasons, especially from the clerk's office and the taxing nature that the current schedule puts on them on Fridays.

880
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear all of that.

881
01:10:29,486 --> 01:10:34,011
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of items under suspension, I think I'd be interested in what's coming up under suspension.

882
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:38,035
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first meeting as a councillor, but I've watched, I've been to meetings.

883
01:10:38,055 --> 01:10:47,284
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem to me that ground-shaking, earth-shattering items are coming up under suspension, so that's just something I'd like to kind of dig into a little bit more maybe.

884
01:10:48,305 --> 01:10:52,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think, to an extent, I hear the argument about being here when City Hall's open all day, but...

885
01:10:53,932 --> 01:10:58,934
[SPEAKER_01]: You know we have a committee the whole and department head needs to be serving a resident of Medford at 6 p.m.

886
01:10:58,994 --> 01:10:59,514
[SPEAKER_01]: on a Wednesday.

887
01:10:59,534 --> 01:11:03,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a valid reason to maybe say let's think about this a little more as well.

888
01:11:03,976 --> 01:11:07,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hear you on community engagement Councilor Knight.

889
01:11:08,478 --> 01:11:19,343
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know I've heard from some members of the community since you brought this up in the previous meeting at the end of 2019 that you know a lot of things in the city are scheduled around the fact that this meeting is on Tuesdays and it may not show from

890
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:44,153
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the audience here tonight, but you know on big nights I think people are scheduling their community meetings on you know Wednesday Thursday or another day because they know that if something's big they want to come here and End up be able to be present at the council meeting or even even watch from home And I also think that the agenda timing it's inconvenient for the clerk's office and may be difficult for us to get items filed by Thursday, but it also gives the public and us a

891
01:11:44,624 --> 01:11:48,727
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, most of Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and most of Tuesday to review an agenda.

892
01:11:48,768 --> 01:12:02,519
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so there are some community engagement pieces on that side where, uh, I do think that, um, having five days to review the agenda and if you don't catch it on Friday, you can catch it all the way on Tuesday and you might see an item, uh, there's, there's strong value in that for the community as well.

893
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

894
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:04,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

895
01:12:04,861 --> 01:12:07,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor bears point of information.

896
01:12:07,764 --> 01:12:08,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Consulate nights.

897
01:12:09,943 --> 01:12:16,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, ultimately, the fact of the matter is that one out of four resolutions that get filed by the Council are filed under suspension.

898
01:12:16,089 --> 01:12:19,532
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we're truly committed to being a transparent body, then it shouldn't be issue-based.

899
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:20,452
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be holistic.

900
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:22,434
[SPEAKER_13]: We should be transparent or we shouldn't be.

901
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:23,295
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter.

902
01:12:23,335 --> 01:12:25,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's only a happy birthday, so we're not going to be transparent about that.

903
01:12:26,318 --> 01:12:27,238
[SPEAKER_13]: But this is a big thing.

904
01:12:27,298 --> 01:12:29,360
[SPEAKER_13]: This is something I care about, so we're going to be transparent about this.

905
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:32,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I think if we're going to adopt the mantra of being transparent, let's do it.

906
01:12:33,036 --> 01:12:41,222
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, ultimately, if we have a Friday agenda and a Saturday and a Sunday and a Monday and a Tuesday morning to review it, that's great.

907
01:12:41,302 --> 01:12:42,643
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll review everything that's on the agenda.

908
01:12:42,923 --> 01:12:48,607
[SPEAKER_13]: But, again, the fact of the matter is 25% of the items that come up aren't on the agenda and you can't review something that's not on it.

909
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:50,348
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where I'm coming from.

910
01:12:50,368 --> 01:12:53,069
[SPEAKER_13]: But, again, you know, Mr. President, like I said, six of one, half a dozen of the other.

911
01:12:54,611 --> 01:12:55,311
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my position.

912
01:12:55,911 --> 01:12:56,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

913
01:12:59,420 --> 01:12:59,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

914
01:13:00,801 --> 01:13:07,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I'm pleased to see that my colleague, Councilor Knight, is thinking outside the box.

915
01:13:07,685 --> 01:13:08,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is healthy.

916
01:13:09,867 --> 01:13:22,575
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing I would say, and I think Councilor Bears hit along many of the points that I was going to bring up, but, you know, the allowing for suspension to bring an item up is a council rule.

917
01:13:23,605 --> 01:13:32,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the concern of this council is that council members are using the council rule to bring up something under suspension,

918
01:13:33,086 --> 01:13:35,847
[SPEAKER_02]: then moving the night is secondary.

919
01:13:36,607 --> 01:13:43,309
[SPEAKER_02]: If the issue is bringing stuff under suspension, let's get rid of the rule that allows us to bring stuff up under suspension.

920
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:45,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's discuss that issue.

921
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:47,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I agree with Councilor Bears.

922
01:13:48,270 --> 01:14:01,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say out of the 22% that is part of this resolution, I'd say that 70% are condolences, potholes, and to fix a sidewalk that come up in our interaction

923
01:14:01,954 --> 01:14:04,236
[SPEAKER_02]: between weekends and the next council meeting.

924
01:14:04,977 --> 01:14:12,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I agree, I don't think there's any pressing issues that I've seen over the years that have come up under suspension.

925
01:14:12,544 --> 01:14:14,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it helpful to have that ability.

926
01:14:15,947 --> 01:14:21,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been transparent in government and I'm not concerned about where I stand with transparency.

927
01:14:22,672 --> 01:14:26,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have to remember too that when people get an agenda,

928
01:14:27,016 --> 01:14:36,321
[SPEAKER_02]: We may know what's on the agenda, we may have quick access as a council to documents, but the general public doesn't have that quick access.

929
01:14:36,981 --> 01:14:43,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're limiting the amount of time that someone from the public can get access to documents and do their research.

930
01:14:43,865 --> 01:14:48,027
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the council that research, it's members of the general public.

931
01:14:48,587 --> 01:14:55,690
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're cutting in half the amount of time that we're giving people in the public to look at the agenda and research it.

932
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:59,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And also to get, which we may not consider, child care.

933
01:15:00,531 --> 01:15:05,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the agenda comes out on a Monday and you say, jeez, I'd like to get up there on Wednesday,

934
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:11,841
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't give you a lot of time to put your ducks in line to be able to get the ability to be there.

935
01:15:12,522 --> 01:15:23,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think having the extra few days gives you the ability to look at the agenda, gives you the ability to do the research, gives you the ability to get the childcare that you may need, and to me,

936
01:15:24,117 --> 01:15:25,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been working that way.

937
01:15:25,377 --> 01:15:31,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see a real issue with the transparency issue regarding what's offered under suspension.

938
01:15:32,539 --> 01:15:45,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be very mindful that if we want to keep part of the people in this process, remember, there's a lot of people that watch this meeting to get their news on what's happening in the community.

939
01:15:45,701 --> 01:15:48,942
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that count on the Tuesday night meeting.

940
01:15:49,824 --> 01:15:56,391
[SPEAKER_02]: This meeting, from what I've been told by historians in this city, has been run on a Tuesday night since 1948.

941
01:15:56,671 --> 01:16:00,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's not a reason to keep it, right?

942
01:16:00,715 --> 01:16:02,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've always done it that way.

943
01:16:02,557 --> 01:16:07,542
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's important that Tuesday nights have always been known, that's when the council meets.

944
01:16:07,923 --> 01:16:09,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday night, the school committee.

945
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:20,970
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that City Hall changed their hours of operation some eight to 10 years ago, and now have extended hours on a Wednesday night, I don't think should have any bearing on us.

946
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:35,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never asked or requested, myself or any member of this council, a department head to come up to this meeting, and we've never got a response saying, oh, you guys meet on a Tuesday, we get out at 4.30 on Tuesday, sorry, can't make it.

947
01:16:36,076 --> 01:16:36,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Never heard that happen.

948
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:42,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think that's another reason to say, well, we'll have more access to department heads.

949
01:16:43,302 --> 01:16:48,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea, and if the idea is transparency, maybe we have to look at suspension.

950
01:16:48,246 --> 01:16:55,493
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the big issue, suspension of the rules, then maybe that's eliminate offering things under suspension.

951
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,934
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I offer things on behalf of people in the community.

952
01:16:59,134 --> 01:17:01,117
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not always things that I want to bring up.

953
01:17:01,418 --> 01:17:06,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone may contact me last minute and say, hey, can you put this on the agenda or can you do this or that?

954
01:17:06,085 --> 01:17:08,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of ways things find their way on the agenda.

955
01:17:10,331 --> 01:17:11,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can offer.

956
01:17:12,293 --> 01:17:17,174
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, because we'll offer things that the clerk may have in his hands.

957
01:17:17,614 --> 01:17:22,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So we may call the clerk and we'll get a paper in our packet of something that's under suspension.

958
01:17:22,655 --> 01:17:30,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's a way of disseminating that to the distribution list that goes out from the city clerk's office, right?

959
01:17:30,157 --> 01:17:34,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Your distribution list has hundreds and hundreds if not a thousand names on it.

960
01:17:34,598 --> 01:17:52,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Method residents they get the agenda there may be some other ways of doing it rather than change the night I think it's admirable if the council is looking for more public input which I look for and looking for transparency I'm not quite sure this provides that this Avenue Thank You mr. Thank You councillor marks

961
01:17:54,544 --> 01:17:55,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

962
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:56,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

963
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:04,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I'd like to echo a few of the points made by Councilor Marks, you know, really just that lead time because of the weekend, having that extra time to understand the agenda.

964
01:18:04,912 --> 01:18:10,636
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of times the agendas are written in a way that if you don't come to council meetings regularly, it can seem like a different language.

965
01:18:10,656 --> 01:18:15,000
[SPEAKER_11]: So taking the time to really understand and absorb what's actually going to come before the council.

966
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:19,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and I think Councilor Marks for bringing up childcare and the coordination that needs to go into that.

967
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:27,851
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of times women are the primary caregivers, and when you limit the planning time for child care, you look who can actually come out and speak on an issue.

968
01:18:28,892 --> 01:18:35,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that actually hasn't been mentioned is Tuesday nights, all the city hall staff is already home, so you have those parking spaces.

969
01:18:36,058 --> 01:18:40,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Wednesday nights, if you move the meetings, then the parking lot is full, you have a contentious issue.

970
01:18:40,499 --> 01:18:44,660
[SPEAKER_11]: People who maybe are waffling about coming to a meeting, they see the lot's full, they leave, they don't come in.

971
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:47,501
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's something we have to consider.

972
01:18:47,581 --> 01:18:52,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And then going back to the point of resolutions under suspension, that happens under the purview of this body.

973
01:18:53,302 --> 01:18:57,623
[SPEAKER_11]: So even beyond setting a rule, it's up to the discretion of each and every Councilor here.

974
01:18:57,763 --> 01:19:03,485
[SPEAKER_11]: So having that discretion, deciding, you know, there is stuff that's gonna be timely that you want to bring up that very night.

975
01:19:03,825 --> 01:19:06,306
[SPEAKER_11]: but a lot of times it can wait to be put on the agenda.

976
01:19:06,426 --> 01:19:14,590
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's just things to think about and why Tuesday might, you know, may work better historically and now and going forward.

977
01:19:15,191 --> 01:19:16,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

978
01:19:16,371 --> 01:19:16,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

979
01:19:17,872 --> 01:19:18,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello.

980
01:19:22,294 --> 01:19:25,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it be Monday night, Tuesday, Wednesday night, I don't really, it doesn't, it makes no difference to me.

981
01:19:26,296 --> 01:19:29,958
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been a lot of good points made on both ends here.

982
01:19:32,323 --> 01:19:33,943
[SPEAKER_08]: both for and against this.

983
01:19:33,983 --> 01:19:47,187
[SPEAKER_08]: But the people that I've talked to around the community, like Councilor Behr says, Tuesday night is the night that people plan around for council meetings.

984
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:58,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if, I don't think we've ever requested anybody not come up here because the building wasn't open, because they had to go home.

985
01:19:58,709 --> 01:20:00,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think everybody's been good with that.

986
01:20:03,287 --> 01:20:08,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I like having the extra time to do my research on things, rather than getting it done in two days.

987
01:20:08,568 --> 01:20:19,131
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, as Councilor Marks mentioned, I don't, since, you know, in my eight years here, I don't think anything has come through here under suspension that was really earth shattering.

988
01:20:19,191 --> 01:20:29,513
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I said, for me, I say, I don't care what night I work, it doesn't make any difference, but from the residents that I've spoken to over the last couple of weeks about this,

989
01:20:31,578 --> 01:20:37,040
[SPEAKER_08]: they've expressed to me they weren't in favor of changing the night, so I'll leave it at that.

990
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:39,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

991
01:20:40,901 --> 01:20:41,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Bears.

992
01:20:42,402 --> 01:20:48,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And Councilor, I just want to say I do strongly applaud the goals here and I think we all need to increase transparency and especially think outside the box.

993
01:20:48,664 --> 01:20:59,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree with Councilor Morell that if we want to change the, if we have an issue with suspension, we need to change the rules around suspension or the norms that we all share and the actions that we take as councilors around suspension.

994
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:14,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also think might be an opportunity to have a discussion about more of the supporting materials being online, potentially some sort of, maybe we could change the suspension process so that we could do it over the weekend and actually get it out to the public, maybe not on the agenda.

995
01:21:14,811 --> 01:21:28,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to study open meeting law to make sure that we can do that, but really look at digital ways, maybe even a council social media page to get those issues out, whether it's to a fellow councilor so that we can study it or to the public so that it's at least out there in some way.

996
01:21:28,695 --> 01:21:29,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know if we can.

997
01:21:30,355 --> 01:21:39,540
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's really a chance here to look at a lot of different ways that we can change or adjust the procedures of the council to make sure that people know what's happening and can be involved in what we do.

998
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:41,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

999
01:21:43,582 --> 01:21:44,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Would anybody else like to speak on the issue?

1000
01:21:46,563 --> 01:21:46,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1001
01:21:47,964 --> 01:21:59,410
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Council of the Night, to move the meetings... Okay, so on the motion of Council of the Night, to move the Medford City Council meetings from Tuesday night

1002
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:01,091
[SPEAKER_15]: to Wednesday night.

1003
01:22:04,093 --> 01:22:06,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1004
01:22:08,717 --> 01:22:19,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Clerk Hurtubise.

1005
01:22:20,887 --> 01:22:21,948
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a good point.

1006
01:22:21,988 --> 01:22:23,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I am not entirely clear on that.

1007
01:22:23,229 --> 01:22:23,849
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd have to check.

1008
01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:25,911
[SPEAKER_15]: One minute, please.

1009
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:28,173
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so either.

1010
01:22:40,396 --> 01:22:42,059
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe this is a simple majority.

1011
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:47,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1012
01:22:53,752 --> 01:22:54,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Have some remarks.

1013
01:22:54,633 --> 01:22:55,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1014
01:22:55,614 --> 01:22:57,577
[SPEAKER_02]: This was tabled from, I think, last week.

1015
01:22:58,398 --> 01:23:09,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a little surprised that such a major change to our rules would be requested without at least going to the Rules Committee and have some discussion.

1016
01:23:10,953 --> 01:23:14,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am a little surprised that it's being moved forward tonight.

1017
01:23:14,855 --> 01:23:20,137
[SPEAKER_02]: However, that's under the druthers of the person offering the resolution.

1018
01:23:20,197 --> 01:23:27,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to say that I think at the very least, it should be sent for proper vetting to the Rules Committee.

1019
01:23:28,181 --> 01:23:30,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not going to support it based on what I mentioned tonight.

1020
01:23:31,542 --> 01:23:36,645
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are other options, I think they can be explored at Rule Committee, like Mr. Beers and Ms.

1021
01:23:36,665 --> 01:23:37,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Morell mentioned.

1022
01:23:38,005 --> 01:23:45,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell, and that would be the proper place to vet looking at other solutions maybe to this.

1023
01:23:47,374 --> 01:23:48,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1024
01:23:49,603 --> 01:23:58,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, I brought the paper forward, Mr. President, three weeks before the close of the last session to provide ample opportunity for the new members to be involved.

1025
01:23:59,366 --> 01:24:07,988
[SPEAKER_13]: It was my thinking that because we're starting a new session in a new term, that we should start it all off with the paper and the agenda and go from there.

1026
01:24:08,429 --> 01:24:08,909
[SPEAKER_13]: But like I said,

1027
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:12,191
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to lose sleep over it, one way or the other.

1028
01:24:12,211 --> 01:24:12,852
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

1029
01:24:12,872 --> 01:24:14,853
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be coming here to meet one night or another.

1030
01:24:14,873 --> 01:24:16,034
[SPEAKER_13]: It's either Tuesdays or Wednesdays.

1031
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:18,836
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a real big deal.

1032
01:24:20,157 --> 01:24:21,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1033
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:23,540
[SPEAKER_13]: I've also reviewed the rules.

1034
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,000
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see anything.

1035
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:25,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I don't see anything in the rules either.

1036
01:24:25,882 --> 01:24:28,844
[SPEAKER_15]: So this requires a simple majority, but I, I,

1037
01:24:31,194 --> 01:24:36,919
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't mind me speaking from the chair, I would think something, this is a momentous vote because we're really changing.

1038
01:24:36,939 --> 01:24:44,667
[SPEAKER_15]: And there have been great arguments made on both sides with regard to moving it and not moving it.

1039
01:24:44,727 --> 01:24:46,428
[SPEAKER_15]: So there have been some great arguments here.

1040
01:24:46,989 --> 01:24:47,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Some that I didn't even think of.

1041
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:50,612
[SPEAKER_15]: So parking was one of them, which I thought was a good point.

1042
01:24:54,396 --> 01:24:59,862
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you come in on a Wednesday night, you come in on a Wednesday night, it is tough to find a spot and you have to go across the street.

1043
01:25:00,322 --> 01:25:04,967
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes when there's major issues being discussed, you know, parking can be a challenge.

1044
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:11,535
[SPEAKER_15]: I would think that something like this, though, should move to committee just to kind of flesh it out some more as to

1045
01:25:11,955 --> 01:25:16,618
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, if it doesn't move to Wednesday night, maybe we should look at suspension.

1046
01:25:16,658 --> 01:25:24,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we should look at the rules a little bit more and, you know, see if there can be changes made to make the process more efficient.

1047
01:25:25,585 --> 01:25:28,747
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so I think that, you know- The chair would welcome those recommendations, Mr. President.

1048
01:25:31,269 --> 01:25:35,732
[SPEAKER_15]: So, actually, Councilor Marks.

1049
01:25:38,067 --> 01:25:41,210
[SPEAKER_02]: the time here on the floor, but I think it's written.

1050
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:47,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a rule, and I'm not going to go through the rules, but I thought it was a rule that said there was a standing meeting Tuesdays.

1051
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:48,376
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be 730.

1052
01:25:49,036 --> 01:25:52,639
[SPEAKER_02]: We changed it back some years ago to 7 o'clock to accommodate more people.

1053
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it was a standing rule.

1054
01:25:54,621 --> 01:25:57,223
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not a standing rule, I thought it may have been part of the charter.

1055
01:25:57,544 --> 01:26:00,987
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be something that calls for the meeting of the council.

1056
01:26:01,047 --> 01:26:02,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1057
01:26:02,108 --> 01:26:05,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether it's the charter, whether it's a standing rule, it has to be written somewhere.

1058
01:26:06,752 --> 01:26:09,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to take time now to discuss it.

1059
01:26:09,855 --> 01:26:18,583
[SPEAKER_13]: It's written in the standing rules, but the thing that we were looking up was whether or not it was a supermajority or a majority vote to change the rules.

1060
01:26:19,604 --> 01:26:20,525
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's written in the rules.

1061
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:21,706
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in section one.

1062
01:26:24,052 --> 01:26:26,033
[SPEAKER_02]: that we meet Tuesday nights at 7 o'clock.

1063
01:26:26,273 --> 01:26:27,793
[SPEAKER_13]: It's dictated by the rules, not the chart.

1064
01:26:27,873 --> 01:26:29,934
[SPEAKER_15]: That is stated in the rules of the city council.

1065
01:26:30,074 --> 01:26:32,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always under the impression it was a two-thirds vote to change a rule.

1066
01:26:32,755 --> 01:26:34,995
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not... That is not a rule.

1067
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:45,919
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a simple majority, but a change of this magnitude, I would think, should go to either committee of the whole or subcommittee for further vetting.

1068
01:26:46,219 --> 01:26:48,039
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a committee of rules, right?

1069
01:26:48,059 --> 01:26:48,960
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a rules subcommittee.

1070
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:50,220
[SPEAKER_02]: A rules subcommittee.

1071
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be the appropriate party, but again,

1072
01:26:53,478 --> 01:26:54,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a motion on the floor, Mr. President.

1073
01:26:54,839 --> 01:26:56,439
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is a motion from Consular Knight?

1074
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,160
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1075
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Consular Knight, would you like to keep that motion?

1076
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:00,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1077
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:00,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1078
01:27:00,962 --> 01:27:07,665
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Consular Knight to move the Tuesday night meeting to Wednesday nights, seconded by?

1079
01:27:07,685 --> 01:27:08,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

1080
01:27:09,006 --> 01:27:10,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Consular Scarpelli.

1081
01:27:10,066 --> 01:27:11,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting when, Mr. President?

1082
01:27:11,967 --> 01:27:12,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Starting when?

1083
01:27:12,908 --> 01:27:13,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow.

1084
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:16,505
[SPEAKER_02]: We adopted the standing rules.

1085
01:27:16,526 --> 01:27:17,526
[SPEAKER_02]: We're amending the standing rules.

1086
01:27:17,546 --> 01:27:18,407
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be effective next week.

1087
01:27:18,907 --> 01:27:21,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Effective as of next week's meeting.

1088
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:23,431
[SPEAKER_02]: What about notification to the general public?

1089
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:28,074
[SPEAKER_02]: What about... There's a lot more involved, Mr. President, than just changing a night.

1090
01:27:28,434 --> 01:27:38,522
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking about transparency, how do you change a night that's been established for 72 years and not be transparent about changing the night and alerting the general public?

1091
01:27:40,363 --> 01:28:04,558
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm prepared to vote on mr. President doesn't my thank you on the motion council night second by concert Scarpelli clerk her to be please call the roll council beers Vice president carabino Council night yes Councilor Marks no council morale Council scrap Ellie excuse me President Falco

1092
01:28:05,074 --> 01:28:13,058
[SPEAKER_15]: No, one in the affirmative, six in the negative, the motion fails and the city council meetings will continue to be on Tuesday evening.

1093
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:20,702
[SPEAKER_15]: And for those of you watching at home, that was applause from our camera.

1094
01:28:30,407 --> 01:28:30,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

1095
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:33,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1096
01:28:33,606 --> 01:28:35,167
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe today is January 7th, 2020.

1097
01:28:35,307 --> 01:28:49,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Under unfinished business, we do have paper 19483 establishing the other post-employment benefits trust fund, which is a compliance vote to establish an employee benefits trust with accord with the division of local services from the Department of Revenue.

1098
01:28:50,092 --> 01:28:53,193
[SPEAKER_13]: That was something that we had discussed previously and

1099
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:58,918
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought we adopted, but it was adopted through a committee report, but not a formal vote of the council.

1100
01:28:58,978 --> 01:29:05,322
[SPEAKER_13]: So as such, we had to advertise this ordinance and go through the proper channels, and it's eligible for third reading this evening and move for approval.

1101
01:29:05,962 --> 01:29:15,547
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve 19-483, amendment to article three of revised ordinance OPEB trust, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1102
01:29:16,628 --> 01:29:17,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Clerk, please call the roll.

1103
01:29:18,909 --> 01:29:19,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me a quick second, please.

1104
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:19,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1105
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:33,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears?

1106
01:29:34,099 --> 01:29:34,260
Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Caraviello?

1108
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:36,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1109
01:29:36,721 --> 01:29:37,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight?

1110
01:29:37,321 --> 01:29:37,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1111
01:29:38,142 --> 01:29:38,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

1112
01:29:38,682 --> 01:29:39,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1113
01:29:39,883 --> 01:29:40,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell?

1114
01:29:40,423 --> 01:29:40,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1115
01:29:41,384 --> 01:29:42,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1116
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:42,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1117
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:43,705
[SPEAKER_05]: President Falco?

1118
01:29:43,886 --> 01:29:44,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1119
01:29:44,186 --> 01:29:45,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1120
01:29:46,627 --> 01:29:48,829
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes and the ordinance is adopted.

1121
01:29:54,552 --> 01:30:00,096
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, I mean Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1122
01:30:00,136 --> 01:30:00,876
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1123
01:30:00,936 --> 01:30:01,717
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1124
01:30:06,718 --> 01:30:17,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Consular Marks.

1125
01:30:18,385 --> 01:30:27,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Consular Marks and Consular Knight, be it resolved that Mark Bromley be recognized for his many years of service to the city of Medford and its residents.

1126
01:30:29,853 --> 01:30:30,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Consular Marks.

1127
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:32,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1128
01:30:34,408 --> 01:30:41,393
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say about a gentleman that served the residents of this community for 36 years in the law department?

1129
01:30:43,154 --> 01:30:53,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark was an outstanding city employee, an outstanding department head, a man of faith, a man of the law, and a true friend.

1130
01:30:57,148 --> 01:31:00,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something, Mr. President, that I think you should be very proud of.

1131
01:31:00,731 --> 01:31:06,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, as you know, behind this reel, in general, issues can be very contentious.

1132
01:31:07,416 --> 01:31:20,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And there have been a number of occasions that Mr. Rumley had to come up and represent issues on behalf of the administration, on behalf of the city, that may have been in conflict with the council, or certain members of the council.

1133
01:31:20,746 --> 01:31:24,829
[SPEAKER_02]: And he always did it in a way, Mr. President, that I think was

1134
01:31:25,669 --> 01:31:30,014
[SPEAKER_02]: strictly issue, it was never personal, and that's something I respected about him.

1135
01:31:31,877 --> 01:31:40,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, you could put the issue aside, whatever side you were on, shake hands, and then go on being a friend.

1136
01:31:41,948 --> 01:31:48,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to congratulate him on 36 years of exemplary service to this community.

1137
01:31:48,793 --> 01:31:50,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish him well on his retirement.

1138
01:31:50,934 --> 01:31:58,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we'll be able to tap his vast knowledge and resource that he has gained over the 36 years.

1139
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:04,703
[SPEAKER_02]: He started out as assistant city solicitor and worked his way into the city solicitor role.

1140
01:32:05,464 --> 01:32:09,487
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a true family man and I'm proud to call him my friend.

1141
01:32:10,367 --> 01:32:12,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to wish him well, Mr. President.

1142
01:32:13,248 --> 01:32:25,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we dedicated this meeting, but I'd also like to dedicate this meeting on behalf of our friend, City Solicitor Mark Rumley, and wish him and his family well, Mr. President.

1143
01:32:25,974 --> 01:32:26,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1144
01:32:29,095 --> 01:32:29,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello.

1145
01:32:30,016 --> 01:32:30,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1146
01:32:30,796 --> 01:32:38,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Solicitor Rumley, he was my friend before he was a solicitor, I knew him before I was a councilor.

1147
01:32:40,873 --> 01:32:49,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Municipal law is a different kind of law than what most lawyers practice, and I think Mark was one of the best at what he did.

1148
01:32:50,918 --> 01:33:02,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had many conversations with him, and listen, I went in there for things, and he told me maybe what I didn't want to hear, but he always told you the truth.

1149
01:33:04,895 --> 01:33:06,176
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was a straightforward guy.

1150
01:33:06,496 --> 01:33:09,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I see him at the church, St.

1151
01:33:09,378 --> 01:33:09,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Raphael's Church.

1152
01:33:09,998 --> 01:33:12,040
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a great deacon.

1153
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:19,844
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's another person, another icon that's been in the city for a long time that'll be missed in this building.

1154
01:33:19,884 --> 01:33:25,428
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wish him well in his retirement and hope to see him around and involved in something in the community.

1155
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:27,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1156
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:28,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Neill.

1157
01:33:30,927 --> 01:33:32,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1158
01:33:33,528 --> 01:33:42,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Working in government and working in politics, I think it's safe to say that you come across a very diverse array of people, great people.

1159
01:33:43,372 --> 01:33:46,213
[SPEAKER_13]: You meet a lot of people out in the street that are just wonderful people.

1160
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:50,114
[SPEAKER_13]: You've developed great, strong working relationships with certain individuals.

1161
01:33:50,234 --> 01:33:57,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mark Rumley was a person, when I first got involved in government back some 20 years ago, was very generous with his time to me.

1162
01:33:58,609 --> 01:34:03,653
[SPEAKER_13]: explaining certain things to me, showing me some of the ropes when I was a young kid working in the Senate.

1163
01:34:05,354 --> 01:34:13,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Upon my election to the city council, that relationship grew, and I'm just very lucky to be able to call Mark Rumley a friend.

1164
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:19,964
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, during my term as a councilor, he's always been someone that I've relied on for advice, for wisdom.

1165
01:34:20,584 --> 01:34:24,427
[SPEAKER_13]: I always felt as though the opinion that he gave from a legal perspective was a legal opinion.

1166
01:34:24,447 --> 01:34:25,808
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't politically driven, ever.

1167
01:34:26,588 --> 01:34:34,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark Rumley really held his title as a lawyer and the oath that he's taken to the law first, and he never compromised his integrity.

1168
01:34:34,974 --> 01:34:36,095
[SPEAKER_13]: He's truly a man of the cloth.

1169
01:34:36,135 --> 01:34:40,998
[SPEAKER_13]: He's truly someone that I'm really grateful that I've had the opportunity to work with and to be around.

1170
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:44,060
[SPEAKER_13]: And in government, you meet some of those people.

1171
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,442
[SPEAKER_13]: You're only going to meet so many working in government and working in a public life.

1172
01:34:48,482 --> 01:34:53,244
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mark Brumley is one of those people that I know I'm very lucky to have in my corner.

1173
01:34:53,264 --> 01:34:55,545
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know I'm very lucky to have been able to work with him.

1174
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:57,466
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wish him the best of luck in his retirement.

1175
01:34:57,827 --> 01:35:10,153
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope to say, as Councilor Mark said, that this isn't the last we see of him and that there is a role for him here in City Hall in the future, whether it be as a consultant or as someone that comes down and participates in government and provides us with his opinion.

1176
01:35:10,723 --> 01:35:15,953
[SPEAKER_13]: because that's something that he's never been shy of doing and I hope that he continues to do it because when he did it, he made us all a better body.

1177
01:35:16,535 --> 01:35:18,558
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, Mark, congratulations.

1178
01:35:18,598 --> 01:35:19,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Best of luck.

1179
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:22,165
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish you the best in your retirement and I know you're going to enjoy it.

1180
01:35:23,778 --> 01:35:27,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1181
01:35:27,841 --> 01:35:29,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

1182
01:35:29,382 --> 01:35:35,767
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the distinct pleasure of working with Solicitor Rumley as we were trying to explore potential women's commission by ordinance.

1183
01:35:35,947 --> 01:35:44,393
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was always so impressed with his ability to really hear what people were asking for and come back with stuff that is just absolutely perfect and by the letter of the law.

1184
01:35:44,713 --> 01:35:47,916
[SPEAKER_11]: And in lieu of really a formal training for new councilors,

1185
01:35:48,516 --> 01:36:13,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Solicitor Romley was very kind to incoming councillor bears and myself as far as Giving us kind of just a lay of the land and sharing as much information as he could to make us Make this job a little bit easier for us and help us be the best at this job So I thank him for his many years of service to the city And I'm just sad that I will not get to work with him in an official capacity Thank You councillor Morell consulate beers

1186
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:22,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think very similarly, you know, haven't had the chance to be behind the rail and have him on the other side and see what that looks like from this side.

1187
01:36:22,555 --> 01:36:31,440
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was lucky enough to attend Councilor Rumley's goodbye party hour-long speech by Mark.

1188
01:36:33,221 --> 01:36:39,584
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was actually really great, especially to be able to hear Mark talk about those debates.

1189
01:36:40,143 --> 01:36:47,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could tell it was issue based because he was able to be congenial and the person on the other side of that argument was in the room and they were laughing about it together.

1190
01:36:47,186 --> 01:36:51,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that goes to show that you know he would say that he won and that's why it was fine.

1191
01:36:51,787 --> 01:36:58,370
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it just goes to show that he really did great service to the city and I hope that we will.

1192
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:10,407
[SPEAKER_01]: have his help on the marijuana ordinance and many of the other things that he worked on before that he before he left that maybe only he knows well enough to describe and explain to the public.

1193
01:37:10,507 --> 01:37:18,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to thank him as well for his service and hopefully see him here as a citizen and as a as a help to our council.

1194
01:37:18,653 --> 01:37:18,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1195
01:37:18,933 --> 01:37:19,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Council appears.

1196
01:37:19,994 --> 01:37:20,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1197
01:37:21,395 --> 01:37:22,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Mr. President.

1198
01:37:22,355 --> 01:37:22,576
[SPEAKER_10]: So I

1199
01:37:23,678 --> 01:37:29,140
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that he's a man that deserves to say things over and over again, but I won't.

1200
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:37,942
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that I, too, remember our Method Municipal Law 101, I think, by Professor Rumley.

1201
01:37:38,882 --> 01:37:41,703
[SPEAKER_10]: And he tells you like it is.

1202
01:37:42,183 --> 01:37:43,784
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's so impressive.

1203
01:37:43,824 --> 01:37:50,286
[SPEAKER_10]: And one thing I realized, when you see Mark Rumley, he's a man of passion, love,

1204
01:37:51,278 --> 01:37:52,719
[SPEAKER_10]: and commitment to the city of Medford.

1205
01:37:52,899 --> 01:37:54,059
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one thing you realize.

1206
01:37:54,739 --> 01:37:59,721
[SPEAKER_10]: No matter if you think he's right or wrong, he's always about what's right for Medford.

1207
01:38:00,301 --> 01:38:01,862
[SPEAKER_10]: And he stands by that.

1208
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:04,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is sad to see him go.

1209
01:38:06,565 --> 01:38:13,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I, too, hope that our mayor finds a place for him where he could share his wealth of knowledge.

1210
01:38:13,367 --> 01:38:29,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that his passion and love for his friends and colleagues here in City Hall, the way he speaks of people and members of this community, like Mr. Lee, his best friend, and what he gave to this community.

1211
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:33,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Mark Rumley is, he probably won't

1212
01:38:35,612 --> 01:38:52,578
[SPEAKER_10]: concur with this but you speak in the same breath of Mr. Lee and Mr. Rumley and I think it's something that we'll miss so I too want to wish him luck and he's also a man that really wants to share his

1213
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:59,163
[SPEAKER_10]: his beliefs and his support when times are down.

1214
01:38:59,283 --> 01:39:13,293
[SPEAKER_10]: At times in my life, as a coach or a municipal worker, we've hit bumps in the road and Mark would be the first person to call you and just lend his support and his wisdom.

1215
01:39:13,773 --> 01:39:14,934
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll never forget that.

1216
01:39:16,296 --> 01:39:25,933
[SPEAKER_10]: He's always, he's been a friend when he's reached out and helped us in times of our confusion and need, so I appreciate that, so thank you.

1217
01:39:26,574 --> 01:39:27,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1218
01:39:29,948 --> 01:39:36,932
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may add, I mean, I've only been on the council for four years, and I knew Mark previously to coming on to the council.

1219
01:39:36,992 --> 01:39:45,417
[SPEAKER_15]: But I remember when George and I sat with him for our law 101, it was extremely valuable.

1220
01:39:46,298 --> 01:39:50,740
[SPEAKER_15]: I still have the notes that I referred to today in my notebook, and I take them with me all the time.

1221
01:39:51,781 --> 01:39:54,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark is one of those special people that he's

1222
01:39:55,463 --> 01:40:00,246
[SPEAKER_15]: someone who's truly, truly dedicated to this year, I mean, to this city.

1223
01:40:00,926 --> 01:40:08,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone that puts 36 years into one thing, I mean, to find that commitment, especially today, is really unheard of.

1224
01:40:08,971 --> 01:40:14,294
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's someone that was committed to this city, committed to the process, committed to the law.

1225
01:40:14,374 --> 01:40:20,298
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, he was someone that is just, you don't find too many people like him.

1226
01:40:20,658 --> 01:40:22,239
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's,

1227
01:40:25,088 --> 01:40:29,009
[SPEAKER_15]: It was an honor and a privilege to work with him, to learn from him, to call him a friend.

1228
01:40:30,110 --> 01:40:40,693
[SPEAKER_15]: I do hope that he's still involved and that he can help us through some of the issues that we're going to be working on in the upcoming year, because I think he will be extremely valuable.

1229
01:40:41,293 --> 01:40:46,455
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he still has a lot to give and I hope he's there to help us.

1230
01:40:46,755 --> 01:40:51,816
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank Councilor Marks and Councilor Knight for bringing this resolution forward.

1231
01:40:52,236 --> 01:40:53,797
[SPEAKER_15]: He's someone that, you know,

1232
01:40:54,919 --> 01:40:56,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank God he still lives here in Medford.

1233
01:40:56,300 --> 01:41:02,962
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, you know, he's going to be involved and we will see him on a regular basis, but it was an honor and privilege to work with him.

1234
01:41:03,302 --> 01:41:08,284
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank him for all of his years, his continuous commitment to this community.

1235
01:41:08,844 --> 01:41:12,166
[SPEAKER_15]: And if there's one guy who absolutely loves Medford, it's him.

1236
01:41:12,606 --> 01:41:16,688
[SPEAKER_15]: And so to Mark Romley, if you're watching tonight, thank you for everything.

1237
01:41:17,908 --> 01:41:19,829
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Council Marks, he and Council Knight.

1238
01:41:20,709 --> 01:41:21,269
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1239
01:41:21,289 --> 01:41:21,890
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1240
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:22,650
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

1241
01:41:24,653 --> 01:41:38,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the Honorable Sumbul Siddiqui on her election as Mayor of Cambridge in becoming the first Muslim mayor in the history of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1242
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:42,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Bears.

1243
01:41:43,384 --> 01:41:44,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1244
01:41:44,225 --> 01:41:47,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think our near neighbors in Cambridge had a historic day yesterday.

1245
01:41:48,548 --> 01:41:51,310
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a plan E form of government, so they elected their mayor yesterday.

1246
01:41:52,291 --> 01:42:04,560
[SPEAKER_01]: But Sumbul Siddiqui, I've been really happy to work with her a lot in her role as a Councilor and my role as a private citizen and advocate around regional work on pilot payment and lose of taxes.

1247
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:07,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they have Harvard and MIT, so they're getting a little bit more than we are.

1248
01:42:08,723 --> 01:42:10,444
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still a regional issue.

1249
01:42:11,745 --> 01:42:14,387
[SPEAKER_01]: nonprofits need to be paying their fair share and supporting the community.

1250
01:42:15,628 --> 01:42:32,999
[SPEAKER_01]: She immigrated here with her parents from Pakistan at age two, grew up in public housing towers, and I think her story really shows that government is for everyone and that really leading us into this new century, new millennium, new decade, whatever we want to call it, I think we should congratulate her on becoming the first Muslim mayor in the history of the Commonwealth.

1251
01:42:33,587 --> 01:42:34,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1252
01:42:34,428 --> 01:42:36,849
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1253
01:42:36,869 --> 01:42:37,490
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1254
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:37,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1255
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:38,710
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1256
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:39,811
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

1257
01:42:40,191 --> 01:42:40,712
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize.

1258
01:42:41,092 --> 01:42:42,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morell, I missed your button.

1259
01:42:42,453 --> 01:42:43,073
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize.

1260
01:42:43,534 --> 01:42:45,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to echo Councilor Bears.

1261
01:42:46,576 --> 01:42:51,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Representation is so important in politics, and I think, you know, just showing that politics is for everyone.

1262
01:42:51,519 --> 01:42:52,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone deserves a voice.

1263
01:42:53,100 --> 01:43:00,025
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I believe the new mayor is perhaps the fifth woman mayor in the city, so also count it as one more crack in that glass ceiling.

1264
01:43:00,205 --> 01:43:01,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1265
01:43:03,855 --> 01:43:08,560
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're under suspension, Councilor Scarpelli.

1266
01:43:10,121 --> 01:43:12,544
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we have a community member that would like to speak.

1267
01:43:12,584 --> 01:43:17,789
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he's a historian, a new town city historian.

1268
01:43:18,529 --> 01:43:20,892
[SPEAKER_10]: And hmm.

1269
01:43:22,964 --> 01:43:24,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Please have your name and address for the record.

1270
01:43:25,025 --> 01:43:26,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Chris Donovan for Lorraine Road.

1271
01:43:27,166 --> 01:43:34,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Although I come in with a history books from Joe McGonigal, I'm here to talk about 551 Winthrop Street.

1272
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:41,352
[SPEAKER_16]: But I did have the pleasure to see Joe McGonigal before he had to move out of the city for health reasons.

1273
01:43:41,412 --> 01:43:44,093
[SPEAKER_16]: And he wanted everyone to know how much he loved Medford.

1274
01:43:44,113 --> 01:43:48,355
[SPEAKER_16]: And he gave me some knickknacks and things about Medford that he was so proud of.

1275
01:43:48,435 --> 01:43:51,756
[SPEAKER_16]: So he gave me multiple copies, so I just thought you'd have a couple copies for you.

1276
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,477
[SPEAKER_16]: between the Lawrence Light Guard and

1277
01:43:54,987 --> 01:43:58,989
[SPEAKER_16]: the bicentennial program, Sylvania.

1278
01:43:59,009 --> 01:44:11,116
[SPEAKER_16]: So as part of a historic Medford initiative that I'm trying to sort of promote with signage, with lighting, with reinvigorating some of the stories about some of the people in Medford.

1279
01:44:11,136 --> 01:44:21,902
[SPEAKER_16]: We're really kind of excited maybe in the future to bring back some of the pride that we have in Medford, just like Mr. Rumley, Joe McGonigal, and Tom Convery, all great assets to our community.

1280
01:44:22,723 --> 01:44:28,108
[SPEAKER_16]: I just hope to give a little push for the history and the historic Medford narrative.

1281
01:44:28,748 --> 01:44:38,997
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did say here early about the South Street issue, and I thank Michael Mox, Councilor Marks, and first of all, thank you all for being here and congratulate you all for this new session.

1282
01:44:39,323 --> 01:44:43,566
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's really heartwarming to see the congeniality and professionalism behind the rail.

1283
01:44:43,626 --> 01:44:48,210
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really wonderful with this new positive attitude in Medford.

1284
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,071
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm excited for it.

1285
01:44:49,571 --> 01:44:53,194
[SPEAKER_16]: But the South Street issue, and I know you've rehashed it, but there's five lights down there.

1286
01:44:53,214 --> 01:44:59,739
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually have the numbers for them, but probably an easy fix just to put some light bulbs in those lighting fixtures that are down there.

1287
01:44:59,759 --> 01:45:02,381
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually have the lighting numbers, but I can submit them sort of later.

1288
01:45:02,741 --> 01:45:18,957
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you, Councilor Morelle, for talking about the people who walk there, because I'd like to get a historic tourism venture going and people going to the Royal House and Isaac Hall's house and around Medford Square, Forest Street, our new historic district that's being sort of organized.

1289
01:45:18,977 --> 01:45:19,697
[SPEAKER_16]: We want walkers.

1290
01:45:19,737 --> 01:45:23,100
[SPEAKER_16]: We want people walking these places, and that's a really dangerous spot.

1291
01:45:23,441 --> 01:45:24,722
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did have a chance as

1292
01:45:25,843 --> 01:45:28,204
[SPEAKER_16]: We've talked about the DCR not really stepping up to bat.

1293
01:45:28,484 --> 01:45:30,345
[SPEAKER_16]: I just took it upon myself to go down there and clean it.

1294
01:45:30,725 --> 01:45:34,987
[SPEAKER_16]: I took bags of weeds and cleaned it up, and they're probably still there.

1295
01:45:35,048 --> 01:45:45,373
[SPEAKER_16]: So I called the DPW, I called the DCR, and I don't know if I got too much fulfillment on that, but there's still some trash down there that I was too big to sort of haul away.

1296
01:45:45,413 --> 01:45:50,155
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's something that's one of our civic prides is the Mystic River, and I'm really happy to sort of try and promote that.

1297
01:45:51,949 --> 01:45:57,172
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's really, I'm here for the 551 Winthrop Street, Winthrop Estates project that's really got me concerned.

1298
01:45:57,693 --> 01:46:03,135
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not really sure, and I just heard about it's hard to get information or where you get information before you come to the meeting.

1299
01:46:03,155 --> 01:46:07,758
[SPEAKER_16]: So as a citizen, too, it's very difficult to understand where certain projects are.

1300
01:46:08,098 --> 01:46:11,520
[SPEAKER_16]: And development is coming, we're happy, we're excited about new development.

1301
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:16,583
[SPEAKER_16]: But that project near the high school at 551 Winthrop Street, called the Winthrop Estate,

1302
01:46:18,204 --> 01:46:24,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Development in in flux or it's and I'm not sure and you can maybe this is why I'm here.

1303
01:46:24,733 --> 01:46:25,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it for?

1304
01:46:26,235 --> 01:46:32,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Housing units that's being proposed there or 11 so for I think was approved and and we're excited about that.

1305
01:46:32,845 --> 01:46:33,666
[SPEAKER_16]: But now it seems like

1306
01:46:34,005 --> 01:46:37,628
[SPEAKER_16]: The scope may be going on for a larger project that includes a new street.

1307
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:47,436
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems very uncomfortable to see that this project is kind of developing on the go, on the fly, and to see explosions up there.

1308
01:46:47,456 --> 01:46:49,498
[SPEAKER_16]: I've had at least four of them that I've heard.

1309
01:46:49,778 --> 01:46:51,179
[SPEAKER_16]: They shake our houses.

1310
01:46:51,259 --> 01:46:52,400
[SPEAKER_16]: They shake the houses.

1311
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:53,181
[SPEAKER_16]: It's bedrock.

1312
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:55,963
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can clarify, it's blasting, not explosions.

1313
01:46:56,403 --> 01:46:57,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Blasting.

1314
01:46:58,404 --> 01:47:01,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Explosions of rock to separate the rock from the ground.

1315
01:47:01,266 --> 01:47:02,527
[SPEAKER_15]: They're blasting in the area.

1316
01:47:02,647 --> 01:47:03,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1317
01:47:03,127 --> 01:47:03,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1318
01:47:03,507 --> 01:47:04,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1319
01:47:04,548 --> 01:47:08,571
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe two blocks away, but I've heard from people, you know, five blocks away that they feel it too.

1320
01:47:08,631 --> 01:47:12,053
[SPEAKER_16]: So that bedrock is all connected and our foundations are

1321
01:47:13,102 --> 01:47:36,887
[SPEAKER_16]: risk and I just uncomfortable to think that who is taking charge of that who's in control who's watching it from a city's perspective for that I know they may have a permit for that but I'm nervous that they're trying to go beyond the scope of the project and I just like some some understanding of that it doesn't have to be now but at least if we can get some understanding from our community what is the scope of the project now and

1322
01:47:37,347 --> 01:47:41,990
[SPEAKER_16]: and is there potential for them to be reaching beyond that ad hoc?

1323
01:47:42,571 --> 01:47:53,138
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what we're nervous about, because that project, as they come up here before, and I thought we had shut it down as a recommendation of the Economic Development Board to not go after that 11 units with an additional street.

1324
01:47:54,539 --> 01:48:03,224
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not sure of the status of that, but that would go all the way back to the high school, which would entail a massive earth-moving project that will continue to

1325
01:48:04,325 --> 01:48:08,368
[SPEAKER_16]: blast stone, stone, not just earth moving, but stone out.

1326
01:48:08,448 --> 01:48:13,972
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, who knows what multiple days, weeks of blasting could, could do.

1327
01:48:14,092 --> 01:48:18,756
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think my concern is, is it a four unit project or the 11 unit project?

1328
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:23,540
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it a work in project or does it have some finite definition to it?

1329
01:48:25,321 --> 01:48:26,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Totsel Knight, did you want to speak on this?

1330
01:48:30,128 --> 01:48:34,170
[SPEAKER_13]: for bringing the books and to please extend my regards to Mr. McGonigal.

1331
01:48:34,190 --> 01:48:35,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Let him know I'll be reading the books.

1332
01:48:35,451 --> 01:48:36,651
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate him bringing them down.

1333
01:48:36,731 --> 01:48:38,973
[SPEAKER_13]: But then he kind of started going after me.

1334
01:48:39,413 --> 01:48:41,194
[SPEAKER_13]: He gave us the books.

1335
01:48:41,934 --> 01:48:43,675
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's what I was going to get at.

1336
01:48:43,695 --> 01:48:44,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry to ruin your mojo there.

1337
01:48:45,016 --> 01:48:45,316
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize.

1338
01:48:48,202 --> 01:48:49,243
[SPEAKER_15]: So we do thank you for the books.

1339
01:48:49,303 --> 01:48:54,687
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as that development goes, all that information would be in the building department.

1340
01:48:56,528 --> 01:48:59,551
[SPEAKER_15]: If the scope of that project is changed, I'm not aware of it.

1341
01:48:59,651 --> 01:49:01,512
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if any of the Councilors are.

1342
01:49:04,154 --> 01:49:10,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think at this point, maybe we should have some kind of a report from either the administration or the building department where we are with this.

1343
01:49:11,098 --> 01:49:12,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's been going on for a while.

1344
01:49:12,958 --> 01:49:15,720
[SPEAKER_08]: And people ask me all the time, what's going on there?

1345
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:17,581
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know what the answer to me is.

1346
01:49:17,681 --> 01:49:19,402
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be four houses.

1347
01:49:19,702 --> 01:49:26,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I have a concern for a safety hazard, for that big cliff that's up at the top there.

1348
01:49:26,805 --> 01:49:32,288
[SPEAKER_08]: There should be a fence up there if there's any children or animals that can fall off that.

1349
01:49:33,008 --> 01:49:49,903
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask to make this part of the motion that either the building departments or I don't know what departments will fall under, but come here and address the council, the building commission, and let us know where we are with that project, where it's going.

1350
01:49:51,038 --> 01:49:52,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, is this, what's it, like four years now?

1351
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:54,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Three or four years now it's been going on.

1352
01:49:54,681 --> 01:49:59,565
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can make that a form of motion, I'd appreciate it.

1353
01:50:00,026 --> 01:50:02,548
[SPEAKER_08]: And number two, I want to thank you for the books.

1354
01:50:03,629 --> 01:50:04,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe McGonigal.

1355
01:50:06,546 --> 01:50:10,787
[SPEAKER_08]: being the senior citizen of the group here, I don't think many of these people were born in 1976.

1356
01:50:12,607 --> 01:50:24,911
[SPEAKER_08]: When this happened, I do remember, I remember it, my wife and I, we had just gotten married, and I think they had the Boston Symphony Orchestra play that year, and they closed, and it was a great, great event.

1357
01:50:24,991 --> 01:50:29,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And I say, I don't know if anybody on the council was born, maybe,

1358
01:50:31,472 --> 01:50:36,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Council Marks, but I know Adam's my son's age, and he wasn't born yet.

1359
01:50:36,734 --> 01:50:41,616
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do remember it was a great take, and it was a really good community thing with fireworks.

1360
01:50:43,196 --> 01:50:44,096
[SPEAKER_16]: We hope to bring that back.

1361
01:50:44,136 --> 01:50:45,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope to bring that back.

1362
01:50:45,397 --> 01:50:46,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Parades.

1363
01:50:46,417 --> 01:50:51,299
[SPEAKER_08]: And you go back, and you look at some of the businesses that were the sponsors in the book.

1364
01:50:51,319 --> 01:50:54,860
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to see, because being the oldest president, I do remember.

1365
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,621
[SPEAKER_08]: So nostalgic.

1366
01:50:56,661 --> 01:50:57,341
[SPEAKER_08]: So nostalgic, yeah.

1367
01:50:57,901 --> 01:50:59,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's something, you get to be a senior citizen.

1368
01:51:00,602 --> 01:51:00,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1369
01:51:01,255 --> 01:51:01,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1370
01:51:02,017 --> 01:51:06,508
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of consular caviello to receive a report.

1371
01:51:09,172 --> 01:51:10,953
[SPEAKER_15]: No worries, we're gonna get to everyone.

1372
01:51:11,293 --> 01:51:17,317
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello to receive a report from the building department with an update.

1373
01:51:18,358 --> 01:51:24,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, if the commissioner could come here and actually address us and take any questions that we may have also, I think it would be.

1374
01:51:24,823 --> 01:51:35,630
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we receive a report from the building department with an update with regard to the development on Wither Street and if they could come and present, building commissioner could come and present

1375
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:37,350
[SPEAKER_15]: and give us a verbal update as well.

1376
01:51:37,491 --> 01:51:39,871
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion, seconded by... Mr. President, if I may amend.

1377
01:51:40,091 --> 01:51:43,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by... I'd just like to amend... Councilor Knight.

1378
01:51:43,393 --> 01:51:44,253
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to amend the paper.

1379
01:51:44,273 --> 01:51:51,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Because of the scope of the paper and the scope of the project, I believe it's a project that's gonna be subject to site plan review, number one.

1380
01:51:51,455 --> 01:51:54,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two, I think it might fall under subdivision control.

1381
01:51:55,157 --> 01:52:00,158
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are two aspects of our zoning act that are governed by the Office of Community Development.

1382
01:52:00,178 --> 01:52:00,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

1383
01:52:00,398 --> 01:52:04,900
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to ask that the director of the Office of Community Development also be involved in the future discussions.

1384
01:52:06,142 --> 01:52:11,464
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Morell, as amended by Councilor Knight.

1385
01:52:13,805 --> 01:52:15,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morell, did you wanna speak on this?

1386
01:52:15,506 --> 01:52:16,227
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought you were.

1387
01:52:16,407 --> 01:52:17,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, yeah, I did.

1388
01:52:17,067 --> 01:52:19,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, I mean, I don't have any more information than anyone else.

1389
01:52:19,828 --> 01:52:21,009
[SPEAKER_11]: I live close to this.

1390
01:52:21,349 --> 01:52:27,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I live close to this ongoing, whatever it is at this point, this ongoing hole, yeah.

1391
01:52:27,692 --> 01:52:30,753
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, we could talk circles around this because there's a number of issues.

1392
01:52:30,853 --> 01:52:32,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe there's no sidewalk on the other side.

1393
01:52:32,634 --> 01:52:34,355
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the portion where there's no sidewalk on Rent the,

1394
01:52:35,455 --> 01:52:37,996
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a mess, and I don't have the answers.

1395
01:52:38,016 --> 01:52:39,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know what's going on, so I agree.

1396
01:52:40,136 --> 01:52:45,618
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just love to be able, for myself, I live near there, but also, as people ask, to be able to give them an answer.

1397
01:52:47,099 --> 01:52:48,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1398
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:51,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Bierce.

1399
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:52,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1400
01:52:53,621 --> 01:53:01,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Caraviello, you don't want to know when I was born, but I just wanted to also say, Chris, thank you for bringing these in, and send our best to the former clerk.

1401
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,484
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I hope we address your concerns on the blasting.

1402
01:53:05,865 --> 01:53:06,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1403
01:53:08,068 --> 01:53:08,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

1404
01:53:09,717 --> 01:53:10,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1405
01:53:11,058 --> 01:53:16,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the sidewalks are going to be replaced by Eversource when they get through Winthrop Street.

1406
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:20,501
[SPEAKER_02]: So remember we discussed, I think that might be in the works.

1407
01:53:20,521 --> 01:53:23,702
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's actually a positive thing.

1408
01:53:23,722 --> 01:53:37,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I just would caution, I'm not sure who from the Office of Community Development would show up, but where this is actively something, and the director, I believe, is the Secretary of Community Development Board.

1409
01:53:38,588 --> 01:53:44,516
[SPEAKER_02]: that they are very cautious about having any influence by anybody.

1410
01:53:45,998 --> 01:53:47,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would just caution.

1411
01:53:50,655 --> 01:53:50,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1412
01:53:50,935 --> 01:54:02,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, I think Paul Moki, the, the building commissioner who attends those meetings and it's actually sits on, I think the board would probably be a good person to give us an update.

1413
01:54:03,243 --> 01:54:04,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he tends, I don't know if he sits on that board.

1414
01:54:04,884 --> 01:54:06,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he, I know he attends the meetings.

1415
01:54:07,386 --> 01:54:15,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I just would be cautious on, uh, having anyone that may be potentially be involved in a vote coming before us.

1416
01:54:17,572 --> 01:54:18,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to put that out there.

1417
01:54:18,693 --> 01:54:19,654
Okay.

1418
01:54:19,794 --> 01:54:20,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1419
01:54:22,843 --> 01:54:23,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Locks.

1420
01:54:23,964 --> 01:54:28,908
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, oh, Chris, someone would like to speak on this issue.

1421
01:54:29,428 --> 01:54:31,490
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could please have your name and address for the record.

1422
01:54:31,931 --> 01:54:33,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricky Cormier, 115 Middlesex Ave.

1423
01:54:34,373 --> 01:54:39,557
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Winthrop Street thing, before I came here tonight, my mother, who lives on 26 Bible Lane, asked me to bring this up.

1424
01:54:40,378 --> 01:54:49,125
[SPEAKER_00]: That project was dormant for several months, and then all of a sudden today, they started the blasting, which sounds like explosions, and there was no notification made.

1425
01:54:49,885 --> 01:54:51,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was very concerned that

1426
01:54:52,493 --> 01:54:53,714
[SPEAKER_00]: given the things going around the world.

1427
01:54:54,294 --> 01:54:57,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Jared, four explosions that shook the house all the way on Barbara Lane.

1428
01:54:58,197 --> 01:55:05,761
[SPEAKER_00]: If blasting is done anywhere in the city, maybe there could be some type of notification done to people that are going to feel it so that they know that they're not being bombed.

1429
01:55:05,781 --> 01:55:07,222
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about it.

1430
01:55:08,023 --> 01:55:09,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for keeping meetings on Tuesdays.

1431
01:55:09,564 --> 01:55:09,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.

1432
01:55:09,924 --> 01:55:10,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1433
01:55:11,785 --> 01:55:12,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Cormier.

1434
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:24,887
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could elaborate, they did send, and it was just probably the closest abutters, but they got the letter on Friday at about three o'clock to say they were blasting on Monday.

1435
01:55:24,967 --> 01:55:34,195
[SPEAKER_16]: So, and at the economic development meeting, I think that was the advisory committee to approve the new project that was going forward, which they denied.

1436
01:55:35,176 --> 01:55:40,420
[SPEAKER_16]: The comments were that they were doing this kind of ad hoc, they were kind of looking to expand this project.

1437
01:55:41,921 --> 01:55:43,342
[SPEAKER_16]: after they'd already been approved for four.

1438
01:55:43,362 --> 01:55:45,763
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's my reason for being here.

1439
01:55:45,843 --> 01:55:47,344
[SPEAKER_16]: We're all excited for development.

1440
01:55:47,385 --> 01:55:48,805
[SPEAKER_16]: We want that project finished.

1441
01:55:48,866 --> 01:55:59,833
[SPEAKER_16]: We're hoping to get that beautified, but we're nervous that they're going beyond the scope of it, including this kind of blasting, which may be the beginning of a new project that hasn't been approved.

1442
01:55:59,893 --> 01:56:05,677
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was my concern for being here today, not to squash the project at hand, but that they're not going beyond the scope of the project.

1443
01:56:05,697 --> 01:56:08,839
[SPEAKER_16]: So they did address the abutters for it,

1444
01:56:09,372 --> 01:56:12,613
[SPEAKER_16]: It's probably just as little as they had to do in 11th hour.

1445
01:56:12,673 --> 01:56:15,414
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you all for your support.

1446
01:56:15,514 --> 01:56:15,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1447
01:56:15,794 --> 01:56:16,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1448
01:56:16,194 --> 01:56:16,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears.

1449
01:56:17,375 --> 01:56:17,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1450
01:56:17,635 --> 01:56:34,140
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's worth anything else, but it might be worth at least bringing up in the meeting is what are our policies around notifying a butters, especially if we're going to do blasting, which might have a larger range than more traditional, the region that we, I mean, 26 Barbara lanes close, but it's not an immediate a butter.

1451
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:38,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, might need to look at that for blasting just cause we don't want people scared.

1452
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:42,123
[SPEAKER_15]: And those are good questions that we can ask the building commissioner when it comes to the meeting.

1453
01:56:42,183 --> 01:56:42,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1454
01:56:42,563 --> 01:56:42,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1455
01:56:42,844 --> 01:56:44,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Counsel appears on the motion of console.

1456
01:56:44,845 --> 01:56:48,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Caraviello seconded by councilor Morell as amended by Councilor Knight.

[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes while we're on the suspension.

01:57:41,896 --> 01:57:43,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Records, records.

1470
01:57:44,957 --> 01:57:45,798
[SPEAKER_15]: You did some announcements?

1471
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:54,442
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is the clerk's favorite part of the agenda, records.

1472

[SPEAKER_15]: Records, the public, the records of the meeting of December 17th, 2019 were passed to Councilor Caraviello.

1473
01:58:03,627 --> 01:58:06,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello, I can see you have that very thick binder of records.

1474
01:58:07,109 --> 01:58:08,229
[SPEAKER_15]: How did you find those records?

1475
01:58:12,131 --> 01:58:12,692
