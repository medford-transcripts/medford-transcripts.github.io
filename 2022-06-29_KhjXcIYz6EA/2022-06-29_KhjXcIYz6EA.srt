1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:02,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:04,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

3
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:08,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

4
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:10,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Is member Ruseau coming?

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,171
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he said he couldn't come.

6
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:13,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Before it was scheduled.

7
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:16,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

8
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:22,795
[SPEAKER_05]: We have committee of the whole meeting on Wednesday, June 29th, 4 p.m.

16
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:12,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, the school committee will vote on whether or not to accept changes made by a member to the 2021-2022 evaluation of our superintendent, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, due to an error.

17
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:18,450
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could, I guess if member Oso's not here, I could call the roll first.

18
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,856
[SPEAKER_05]: In no particular order.

19
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:23,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

20
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:24,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

21
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hays?

22
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:28,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

23
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:30,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

24
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:31,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

25
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:32,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

26
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:33,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

27
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:35,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone?

28
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:35,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

29
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:40,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And myself here, and Member Ruseau is absent.

30
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,032
[SPEAKER_05]: We have six present, one absent.

31
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:43,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I will

32
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:48,129
[SPEAKER_05]: turn it over to number one, which I think Member McLaughlin, per your request.

33
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:49,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mayor.

34
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,791
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, colleagues.

35
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:56,093
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies for having everyone reconvene, especially during the summer.

36
00:01:57,254 --> 00:02:09,181
[SPEAKER_03]: The superintendent evaluation that occurred last week, I noticed after doing some comparison to my evaluation that the Google Sheets form that I had used had been incorrect and some of the numbers

37
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:16,511
[SPEAKER_03]: were incorrect and actually added some comments as well that I thought were necessary, particularly after the meeting.

38
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:24,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And the primary reason I think that the numbers were incorrect, again, was the Google Sheets, which automatically populates the form.

39
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:26,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a process that's fairly new.

40
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:28,273
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the second time we've done this.

41
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:33,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, I was a secretary, so I orchestrated the process last year.

42
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:34,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very different when you're

43
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,969
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of behind the scenes doing it as opposed to when you're submitting.

44
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,330
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that was part of the problem and part of what was lost in translation.

45
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to apologize to Dr. Edouard-Vincent as well for my mistake and my error.

46
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:57,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm asking my colleagues to consider the errors and allow me to resubmit my evaluation for the superintendent based on that error.

47
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:00,474
[SPEAKER_02]: On the calendar, does it say July 3rd, when?

48
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:02,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone, I'm just gonna mute you.

49
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:03,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

50
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:04,492
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

51
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:05,272
No problem.

52
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:14,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there a motion on the floor to accept member McLaughlin's corrections?

53
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:16,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I think member Graham has her hand raised.

54
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, member Graham.

55
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:22,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wanted to make a motion to rescind the approval of the superintendent's evaluation.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,682
[SPEAKER_04]: We really shouldn't be discussing this at all until we agree that we are rescinding the evaluation.

57
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:27,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

58
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:31,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to rescind the evaluation.

59
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

60
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:34,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I will call the roll.

61
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

62
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:36,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

63
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:37,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

64
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:38,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

65
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:39,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hays?

66
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

67
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:41,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone?

68
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:41,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

69
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:42,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

70
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:43,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

71
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:45,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Brianna, yes.

72
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:47,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau, absent.

73
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:53,104
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 16 affirmative, one absent to rescind the initial approval of the evaluation.

74
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:57,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for the chair, thank you for that process aspect.

75
00:03:57,785 --> 00:04:00,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I had forgotten that, so it's really important.

76
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:10,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm making a motion, if I can, to ask that my colleagues accept my apologies and my mistake in the evaluation and allow me to resubmit the evaluation.

77
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:15,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to accept the revisions from Ms.

78
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:18,267
[SPEAKER_06]: McLaughlin for the superintendent's evaluation.

79
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:22,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to accept by member Kreatz, seconded by- Second.

80
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:26,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, I can do the roll.

81
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I offer a friendly amendment?

82
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:30,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

83
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:53,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Given that we all sat through substantive conversation about this, I would like to ask that we all are afforded the same opportunity to resubmit a review or comments or whatever we may deem appropriate or not, but that the entire committee is afforded the same opportunity.

84
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:57,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

85
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:08,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my point to that would be if there were mistakes on the previous evaluations that other folks did that they should, you know, be able to submit their evaluation.

86
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:11,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly had mistakes and I'm owning those.

87
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:23,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And my concern is that if everybody's going to resubmit the evaluation, then we would, that potentially that would require another meeting to discuss the resubmissions of everyone on the evaluation.

88
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:25,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And if folks had errors on them,

89
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:28,963
[SPEAKER_03]: then obviously I think they should be resubmitted.

90
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:35,908
[SPEAKER_03]: If folks didn't have errors on them, then I would, I guess, ask what that purpose is.

91
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:39,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we don't have an approved evaluation at this point, right?

92
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:40,311
[SPEAKER_04]: We just rescinded it.

93
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:46,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to meet again to approve the superintendent's evaluation regardless.

94
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:53,751
[SPEAKER_05]: We could take a vote tonight to accept the changes by Member McLaughlin and approve.

95
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:55,852
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't even know what the changes are.

96
00:05:56,853 --> 00:06:00,394
[SPEAKER_04]: We would be blindly approving a review that we've never seen.

97
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:05,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It would just be her additions and then you do the calculations.

98
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:06,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

99
00:06:07,017 --> 00:06:07,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mayor.

100
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:13,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just the calculations because none of us saw the individual member reviews, which was part of

101
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:26,449
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue in terms of the process frankly as I was reviewing the process from last year as well we had a calculation sheet that allowed us to see each other's reviews as we were doing our own which sort of informs the process without us working in silos.

102
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:33,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a discussion for another meeting and so I don't want to overstep the open meeting laws around that but the whole purpose is that

103
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:43,685
[SPEAKER_03]: it would recalculate in terms of that process, not necessarily affect the member reviews per se.

104
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:48,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So I leave it up to my colleagues as well, I believe Member Kreatz and Member Mustone have their hands up.

105
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,257
[SPEAKER_05]: member, I think it's a member of stone for us and members.

106
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:53,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

107
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy with my evaluation and I haven't heard anyone else.

108
00:06:57,278 --> 00:06:59,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going by the emails that were sent to us.

109
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:07,800
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also just thought we were, it was Melanie who felt like that they are Melanie didn't feel like she, um, fills out the evaluation correctly.

110
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we're meeting.

111
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:17,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was just to make her changes to be put in for the average score, I guess, because we didn't, I didn't see anyone else's.

112
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:18,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

113
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:23,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I didn't make any corrections or changes myself.

114
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:24,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't make any mistakes.

115
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:31,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So I expected this meeting to just be accept her changes and approval as changed.

116
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:34,571
[SPEAKER_05]: There are new comments in there and just the recalculation.

117
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:36,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

118
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:43,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I was going to say the same thing that I didn't have any revisions to my end.

119
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:51,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Russo, before he went on vacation, he already updated my comments and the mayor's comments and shared it with everybody.

120
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else was fine.

121
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think this year it was a little bit different.

122
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:08,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that we're not allowed to see each other's evaluations, but this time we weren't given the opportunity to even see our own evaluations.

123
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:37,492
[SPEAKER_06]: in the final version so I think you know maybe in the future if we can be shared okay this is what I have for your evaluation can you review it and let me know if it's okay whoever's doing it or everything could be sent in maybe to the superintendent secretary and she could review it you know everybody's individually so that we're not looking at them so that there's another set of eyes on them because I was reading some of the instructions and

124
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:54,338
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at the instructions for one, two, three, and four, in order for somebody to get a one or a two or a three, something has to be, so to speak, like broken in the prior evaluation.

125
00:08:54,378 --> 00:09:02,681
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was thinking there has to be a cross-examination between the prior evaluation and the current evaluation.

126
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:10,686
[SPEAKER_06]: for individual evaluations to ensure that the numbers are recorded correctly.

127
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:12,909
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very complicated.

128
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:16,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I find the whole process to be very complicated and confusing.

129
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:16,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do.

130
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:19,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really wish it was easier.

131
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I don't like the current process.

132
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Mr. Russo said some of us didn't follow the instructions.

133
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:27,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried my best.

134
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:38,144
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a confusing form, so I just did it myself on Excel and sent it in that way because I didn't like the Google Sheets, the way that I don't like how they're filled in.

135
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:42,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did it the alternative way and sent it in that way.

136
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:46,374
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm just sharing my thoughts, but I don't have any changes.

137
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:51,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just, I thought the meeting was just to hear the, receive the updates.

138
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:58,020
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once Mr. Russo gets back, the averages can be redone and then it can be sent off.

139
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, member Graham and member McLaughlin.

140
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:18,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm asking my colleagues to acknowledge that we all sat through a substantive discussion and we may all feel like a mistake was made in one way, shape or form.

141
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:26,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't understand what the harm is in affording the opportunity for anybody who feels like they

142
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:31,546
[SPEAKER_04]: made a mistake to review.

143
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:37,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's great if you don't feel that way, but I also think there's at least one member of the committee that's not even here to weigh in.

144
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:52,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So all I'm asking is that everyone be afforded the same opportunity to correct any mistakes they feel like they made and that we have a meeting to review the superintendent's revised evaluation accordingly.

145
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:56,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

146
00:10:57,418 --> 00:10:58,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

147
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, through the chair, I can understand that concern.

148
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:09,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe that before Member Ruseau left and he sent an email, said that he was not interested in changing his evaluation.

149
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:18,287
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I do believe that, you know, anyone can make mistakes and that it's appropriate to correct them.

150
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:29,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I also believe to member pretz's point, and I believe that we're going to make it, you know, that we've discussed looking at the process come September, that there was also

151
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:33,439
[SPEAKER_03]: there's some confusion in the process.

152
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:41,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Member Pex just said, and I would agree to disagree on this point with Member Pex, that we're not allowed to see each other's member reviews.

153
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:43,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was super informative last time.

154
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:56,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually had a sheet that was created, a Google sheet that was created, and certainly not by me, but we can see from the last reviews on the tabs, there was the current review, and then there was an additional tab that was member reviews, and then it had sections of each member and how

155
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:10,332
[SPEAKER_03]: We had all reviewed and what our comments were and that was super informative because this is not one member evaluating the superintendent, this is, you know, all of us as collective evaluating the superintendent so we should be able to see and share.

156
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:12,159
[SPEAKER_03]: information on an evaluation.

157
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know why this year we weren't able to, it didn't make any sense to me.

158
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:23,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess, you know, maybe in retrospect, you know, I could have asked for the meeting to be rescheduled or something.

159
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:30,990
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, in addition to that, finding the errors on my part just made it even more obvious that, you know, the process was flawed.

160
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:39,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And so really the purpose I thought of the meeting today based on what was posted publicly and for the agenda was that we would

161
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:50,681
[SPEAKER_03]: review the resubmitted evaluation process and vote to see if that would be approved, that I made a mistake and wanted the process approved.

162
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:57,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was actually posted on the agenda, may I ask, because I didn't open it early.

163
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Susie or Maurice have it?

164
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:00,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

165
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:07,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I did have it.

166
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:22,137
[SPEAKER_05]: The school committee will vote on whether or not to accept changes made by a member to the 2021-2022 evaluation of Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent due to an error.

167
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we can motion.

168
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:32,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a motion on the floor to accept member McLaughlin's changes and approve it as newly calculated, but I think member Hays would like to speak.

169
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:35,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

170
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:40,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I just wanted to say the same as some of my other school committee members have said.

171
00:13:41,718 --> 00:13:43,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I likewise don't feel like I made any errors.

172
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,361
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing I want to change.

173
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:55,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I do hope and plan to meet with the superintendent over the summer just to go over some of my comments and some areas that I didn't get to make any comments because of other things going on in my life.

174
00:13:55,108 --> 00:14:06,877
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that the major thing that I'm finding from this being my first time and just the general kind of confusion that I'm hearing is that we really do need to meet to talk about the process.

175
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:09,239
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know,

176
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:16,939
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be great if we had someone from outside to come in and talk with us about the process because it seems like we ourselves are not clear on it.

177
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:23,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know that just an internal discussion is going to yield satisfying results for everyone.

178
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:26,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's, I think it's, I think it's good.

179
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:33,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just gonna say, I think it's good that we're all taking this so seriously that we are having some major discussions and finding it confusing.

180
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that means that we're all taking it very seriously and trying to figure out the best way

181
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:43,642
[SPEAKER_01]: to make this work both for the school system, but also for the superintendent, because she's ultimately the one who's being evaluated.

182
00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:53,429
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're lacking clarity in it, then it's, you know, it's a tough, tough to be the one who's being evaluated if the people doing the evaluation are expressing confusion.

183
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:56,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm all set with my evaluation though, personally.

184
00:14:58,372 --> 00:14:58,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

185
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:00,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a motion on the floor.

186
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:03,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I think member Kreatz, did you put that motion forward?

187
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:05,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

188
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:10,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.

189
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, motion to accept member McLaughlin's changes and approve it as it will be newly calculated.

190
00:15:17,995 --> 00:15:19,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

191
00:15:21,618 --> 00:15:22,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

192
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:23,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

193
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:24,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

194
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:25,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz.

195
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:26,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

196
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:28,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hays.

197
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:28,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

198
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:30,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone.

199
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:30,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

200
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:31,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

201
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:32,546
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

202
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:35,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Brianna, yes.

203
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:36,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau, absent.

204
00:15:37,614 --> 00:15:39,535
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a five, one, and one.

205
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:40,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

206
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:49,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, we have it be resolved, the initial meeting to discuss the superintendent's goals be moved to the fall of 2022, offered by myself.

207
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I just ask for a motion for approval on that.

208
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

209
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,281
[SPEAKER_05]: By member Kreatz, seconded by member McLaughlin.

210
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:57,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Would anybody like to speak?

211
00:15:59,182 --> 00:15:59,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I would.

212
00:15:59,723 --> 00:16:00,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

213
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,916
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when we unanimously approve this motion back in May.

214
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:13,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe we talked about this but I, you know, the summer is the time when the administration has an opportunity to.

215
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:19,365
[SPEAKER_04]: really do the work that is required to make meaningful progress in the district.

216
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:34,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by not letting the superintendent know what our goals are for her before the school year starts, we're also not being fair to her to then expect her to meet goals that we didn't

217
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:44,549
[SPEAKER_04]: outline for her proactively enough for her to be able to meet them and I think, you know, we're here talking about a review and I think everyone is exceedingly trying to be fair.

218
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:51,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's wildly unfair to set goals at a point in the school year, where they

219
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:53,439
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially cannot be met.

220
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's unfair to the superintendent.

221
00:16:55,701 --> 00:17:04,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the flip side of that is we as a committee don't put forward the goals that our students need, and that's unfair to students.

222
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:08,592
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think this is a conversation worth having.

223
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:14,758
[SPEAKER_04]: We passed a unanimous resolution about this, and I would like to see us get this done before too much of summer goes by.

224
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:20,543
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, from the chair, I just also think it's time to show a little respect to our superintendent.

225
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:29,626
[SPEAKER_05]: And she did ask that she take the summer to review data and to really be able to help us outline those goals.

226
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:31,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to give her that opportunity.

227
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:32,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So I put this motion forward.

228
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:35,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can do it in the early fall, but I think she deserves that.

229
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:36,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

230
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:46,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to ask the superintendent her position on this, which I believe is to have time to be able to

231
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:52,850
[SPEAKER_03]: put these together and for us to meet early in the year so that we can all be on board.

232
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there was a little misunderstanding.

233
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:05,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounded through the chair, like there was a discussion about our goals and, you know, we have, we voted to have goals for the school committee as well for next year.

234
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:16,577
[SPEAKER_03]: But I believe, or I thought we were talking about the superintendent's goals, which of course, you know, should be aligned with our goals, but we haven't set the school committee goals either for the year.

235
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'd like to hear from Dr. Evey if we could.

236
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:23,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.

237
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:44,582
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had our meeting where we discussed my goals specifically, I requested of the committee to present my goals in the fall, to take the summer, to have time to take a step back, reflect on what happened this previous year, strategize and plan for the following year.

238
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:49,290
[SPEAKER_00]: and present the proposed goals to you at the start of the school year.

239
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:56,722
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want the committee to know that I have spoken with many superintendents, all of them that I have spoken with

240
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:04,582
[SPEAKER_00]: present their goals at the beginning of the school year between September, October, the first quarter of the school year.

241
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:14,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I also spoke with MASS just to get additional guidance, although it can happen at different points.

242
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:18,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, sorry, I'm sorry, excuse me, Superintendent, I apologize.

243
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:20,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you just share what MASS is?

244
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:27,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents to receive some additional guidance and

245
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:35,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, the majority of districts goals are presented at the start of the school year.

246
00:19:35,816 --> 00:19:39,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, during the summer, a lot of work does take place.

247
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:50,763
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a team, a district team, we need to have the opportunity to work collaboratively and come up with a plan that we present to the entire committee.

248
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:58,811
[SPEAKER_00]: So I again am in support of the mayor's resolution to wait until the fall.

249
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:05,198
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally am very exhausted and would just like a little bit of time to recharge and regroup.

250
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,021
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a very long year and just to

251
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:15,973
[SPEAKER_00]: feel refreshed and be able to come and present potential goals, knowing that the school committee makes the final decision.

252
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:25,405
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm prepared for whatever decision the committee will make regarding the goals, but I am requesting that the goals be presented at the start of the school year.

253
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:30,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor, Member Graham.

254
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:38,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to read the motion that we unanimously passed because I think there is some conflation of two things going on.

255
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:46,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So be it resolved that the school committee will meet in a committee of the whole to discuss the superintendent goals for the 2022-2023 school year no later than 6-17.

256
00:20:47,557 --> 00:20:55,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that the school committee will finalize and approve the superintendent's goals in a regular school committee meeting or a special school committee meeting no later than 9-30-2022.

257
00:20:57,481 --> 00:21:15,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So the whole point of this meeting was not for the superintendent to present her goals, it was for us to have a collaborative discussion that could help inform the work she's going to do this summer in anticipation of her bringing her goals to us in September, which was the timeline she requested so.

258
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we unanimously approved.

259
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:45,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, like I'm not talking, no one is suggesting that the superintendent needs to put anything together for that meeting, but I thought we were all in agreement that hearing from us about the things that are on our mind would help be informative and rather than being a detraction, but that is where we unanimously agreed not too long ago.

260
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:51,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think what we're doing tonight today is pushing that timeline.

261
00:21:51,889 --> 00:22:03,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can amend my resolution to read, be it resolved the initial meeting to discuss the superintendent's goals, be moved to the fall of 2022 with the finalization early winter.

262
00:22:03,593 --> 00:22:09,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I motion with the reward, the way it was rewarded by the mayor.

263
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:15,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you suggesting we won't approve the superintendent's goals until the winter when the school year is almost over?

264
00:22:17,806 --> 00:22:18,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pushing the timeline.

265
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:23,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it was broken up in two parts in the last resolution, I thought that's what you had asked.

266
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:33,230
[SPEAKER_05]: You wanted to outline of how we should, because the first resolution says initial meeting.

267
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:43,712
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we should outline when the final, you know, we can outline when the final meeting will be, or I just don't want it to be, we need to make sure it's changed from that September 30 date, because that doesn't meet,

268
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:48,417
[SPEAKER_05]: the nature of the resolution number two, which we're gonna be voting on.

269
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:52,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can be late fall or it can be early winter.

270
00:22:53,101 --> 00:23:03,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we just need to change that September 30th date, because based on how the committee votes, I don't think we're gonna meet that September 30th date.

271
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

272
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:06,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

273
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:12,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you through the chair to member Graham for the clarification on

274
00:23:13,787 --> 00:23:23,937
[SPEAKER_03]: The process, I think that clearly the year, June 17 was pretty packed with the budget stuff that was happening as we all know and other things that have been going on.

275
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:29,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that it is important for us to have a meeting in the fall.

276
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:37,709
[SPEAKER_03]: to discuss how we feel about the goals that have been proposed and early, you know, sooner than later.

277
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:46,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And then potentially the superintendent either revise or revisit those goals by 930, September 30th.

278
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:51,519
[SPEAKER_03]: So if possible, if we could, you know, have a meeting early, you know, one of our first meetings be

279
00:23:52,259 --> 00:24:15,229
[SPEAKER_03]: to address the goals that had been proposed and where we are as a school committee, but also in setting our own goals, as we said, we also passed a resolution that we would have goals for the school committee where we would also evaluate ourselves in our process or have some sort, either whether we evaluated ourselves or had someone else evaluate us, it's unclear, but that we would have an evaluation process for school committee as well.

280
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:18,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess with that understanding that

281
00:24:19,464 --> 00:24:31,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hearing the process and purpose of that resolution that had been previously passed was so that we might have some discussion around the goals that had been proposed before they're in play.

282
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:44,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously there's work over the summer, but I think there's plenty of work to be done over the summer and that will align with the goals as well, that we can afford to have that meeting early September

283
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:57,112
[SPEAKER_03]: to discuss the goals, the meeting that member Graham is mentioning for that was supposed to happen on the 17th, which again, I mean, I feel like June's a blur.

284
00:24:57,332 --> 00:25:00,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe July 1st is tomorrow or the next day.

285
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:02,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all gone by so quickly.

286
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:04,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, all the budget stuff that was happening.

287
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:12,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's unfortunate that that calendar item wasn't met, but I think if we can make it one of the first items of the new year, I think that could be helpful.

288
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:13,317
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I,

289
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:21,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I would make a motion or ask for an amendment that we make one of our first meetings be a goal review.

290
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:34,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if that's okay with Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and then the response to that goal review by Dr. Edouard-Vincent could be potentially the September 30th, if my colleagues agree.

291
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:37,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would make that friendly amendment.

292
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:40,396
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely doable.

293
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:45,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I could present draft at the beginning of September.

294
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:51,859
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be the week right after Labor Day, I believe.

295
00:25:53,681 --> 00:26:02,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I could present it at the first meeting, the draft goals, so that we could still meet the deadline of the 30th to present back to the committee.

296
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:04,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I second the motion.

297
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:10,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion on the floor as amended, seconded by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz.
