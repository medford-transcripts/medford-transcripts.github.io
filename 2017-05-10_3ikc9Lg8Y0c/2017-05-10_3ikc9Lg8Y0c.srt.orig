00:00:27,396 --> 00:00:27,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

15
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:29,006
[SPEAKER_19]: President Cariollo.

16
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:32,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Presidents, please rise and salute the flag.

17
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:45,493
[SPEAKER_19]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

18
00:00:49,825 --> 00:01:07,694
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-423, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council receive monthly updates from the Member's Training Tower Committee on the status of their efforts in identifying potential locations for the new construction of the fire training tower.

19
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:08,775
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

20
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:10,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

21
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:16,479
[SPEAKER_11]: With the recent passage of $2 million by the Memphis City Council for a design study for the police station,

22
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:21,796
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a number of questions raised about the future of Medford's Fire Training Tower and Medford's Fire Training Academy.

23
00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:31,001
[SPEAKER_11]: As such, the administration has agreed to appoint an ad hoc committee to begin to identify locations as to where this facility can go when it's reconstructed.

24
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:41,867
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm asking for monthly updates from the administration or from actually the members of the committee as to the progress that they're making so that this can be a front burner item, Mr. President, making sure that it doesn't get lost in the shuffle of progress.

25
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:45,465
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I ask my colleagues to support the resolution and move for approval.

26
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:46,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

27
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:47,747
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor DelaRusso?

28
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:48,387
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

29
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:53,871
[SPEAKER_19]: Second by Councilor, the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

30
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,151
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

31
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:55,492
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

32
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:58,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

33
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:01,135
[SPEAKER_19]: 17.424 offered by Councilor Knight.

34
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:11,542
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it resolved that the city administration move, that the city administration forward to the city council a copy of the open space plan for the city of Medford.

35
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:12,583
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight?

36
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:13,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. President.

37
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:26,174
[SPEAKER_11]: With the recent establishment of the Community Preservation Commission and also the recent discussions that this council has had relative to zoning, I think it's very important that a copy of the open space plan be forwarded to the Medford City Council.

38
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:33,600
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd also like to amend the paper, Mr. President, and ask that a copy of the open space plan also be forwarded to the Community Preservation Commission.

39
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,566
[SPEAKER_11]: With that being said, Mr. President, today, about a half an hour ago, when I checked my email, I did receive a response from Lauren Felch, the Medford City Council liaison,

40
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:47,228
[SPEAKER_11]: that has already forwarded myself a copy of the open space plan, so I'll be happy to share that with my colleagues.

41
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:51,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to amend the paper just to request that it also gets sent to the Community Preservation Commission, Mr. President.

42
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:52,269
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

43
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:56,630
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Longo-Kern.

44
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,011
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favour?

45
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:58,091
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

46
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,311
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

47
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:05,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Clerk, if you could please record Councillor Falco as being present.

48
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,973
[SPEAKER_19]: 17.425, offered by Councillor Knight, being resolved.

49
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:14,259
[SPEAKER_19]: that the Medford City Council requests the following information be forwarded to the council.

50
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:20,960
[SPEAKER_19]: One, the Medford City Council requests the city solicitor offer an opinion on the following question.

51
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:37,744
[SPEAKER_19]: If the city of Medford adopts the provisions of Mass General Law, Chapter 40, Sections 22A, B, and or C, can the receipts received for the appropriation be credited to the special fund for the exclusive purposes

52
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:44,397
[SPEAKER_19]: of funding the position of a traffic engineer in the implementation of traffic calming measures.

53
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:51,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Two, the Memphis City Council requests that the Director of Community Development offer an opinion on the following question.

54
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:59,708
[SPEAKER_19]: What is the estimated industry standard range for a public sector traffic engineer?

55
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:07,614
[SPEAKER_19]: Three, the Memphis City Council requests that the Director of Finance and Auditing provide an opinion on the following.

56
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:24,726
[SPEAKER_19]: What is the annual breakdown of receipts received credited to the city's general fund following the fulfillment of contractual obligations to the parking management vendor since the implementation of the parking management program?

57
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:25,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

58
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:27,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much, Mr. President.

59
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,789
[SPEAKER_11]: With the passage of the Municipal Modernization Act on Beacon Hill,

60
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:37,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Local municipalities have been given some flexibility in regards to their parking receipts.

61
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:42,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Presently, parking receipts are put into the general fund.

62
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,464
[SPEAKER_11]: And with the adoptions of section 22A, B, and C, these receipts can be reserved for appropriation.

63
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:58,891
[SPEAKER_11]: The theory and the thinking behind this resolution, Mr. President, is that we have a parking management program that's in the community where people are required to pay to park in our business districts and elsewhere.

64
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:02,153
[SPEAKER_11]: And if these funds can be reserved for

65
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:11,433
[SPEAKER_11]: specific appropriation, like a traffic engineer, then we might be able to fund this position off the tax rolls through the parking management program.

66
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:26,698
[SPEAKER_11]: So the idea is to, first of all, ask the question to the city solicitor as to whether or not if we adopt these sections, can we reserve the funds for a specific and exclusive principle, which would be the funding of a traffic engineer and the implementation of traffic calming measures that come from that traffic engineer.

67
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:31,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, what's the industry standard salary range?

68
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,180
[SPEAKER_11]: How much do we have to pay?

69
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,840
[SPEAKER_11]: a traffic engineer annually to be competitive and to get somebody that's good?

70
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,660
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the third question is, what's the breakdown of receipts?

71
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,621
[SPEAKER_11]: So do we take in enough money to internally fund a traffic engineer off the tax rolls?

72
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:53,723
[SPEAKER_11]: And with the adoption of these sections under the general laws, can we exclusively earmark these funds for the sole and exclusive purpose of hiring a traffic engineer and implementing traffic calming measures, Mr. President?

73
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:54,863
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the resolution.

74
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:55,743
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the breakdown of it.

75
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd ask my colleagues for their support, and I'd move for approval.

76
00:05:59,044 --> 00:05:59,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

77
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:00,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor Falco.

78
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

79
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:06,595
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to thank Councilman Knight for bringing this forward.

80
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:12,218
[SPEAKER_15]: The position of a traffic engineer is something that I have been advocating for for the past couple of years.

81
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:14,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I've offered a number of resolutions on this.

82
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:25,668
[SPEAKER_15]: I think if this is a way that we can actually pay to support this type of position, I'm all ears and hoping that this is an avenue that we can take to actually fund the position.

83
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:27,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said before,

84
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:31,156
[SPEAKER_15]: A traffic engineer is desperately needed in this community.

85
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:37,002
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go to basically any neighborhood throughout this community and there are traffic issues that need to be addressed.

86
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:43,788
[SPEAKER_15]: We are a cut through community with over five state roads that cut through Medford and this needs to be addressed.

87
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:48,193
[SPEAKER_15]: So I definitely am in favor of this resolution and second the motion.

88
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:52,657
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Lococo.

89
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:53,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

90
00:06:53,677 --> 00:07:01,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Briefly, I just wanted to make sure that we're asking for, to be clear, we're asking for the annual breakdown of receipts since the inception of the program.

91
00:07:02,182 --> 00:07:04,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if we could just maybe add that language.

92
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:09,946
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the annual breakdown of receipts from the inception of the program?

93
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to make sure we don't get just the one year in receipts.

94
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it does say that?

95
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:15,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yep, sorry.

96
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha, clear.

97
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:24,014
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

98
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:27,195
[SPEAKER_19]: By Councilor Falco.

99
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:27,755
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call vote.

100
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:30,956
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

101
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:31,916
[SPEAKER_19]: Please call the roll.

00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:36,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

104
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:38,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

105
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:38,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

106
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:39,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

107
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:39,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

108
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lockern.

109
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:40,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

110
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:41,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Monson.

111
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:42,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

112
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

113
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

114
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,540
[SPEAKER_02]: President Cavioli.

115
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,121
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

116
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

117
00:07:49,322 --> 00:07:50,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

118
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,162
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-426, offered by Councilor Knight and Scott Pelley.

119
00:07:56,822 --> 00:08:12,269
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Stephen Scapperardi and his teammates from the EMAC Celtics on an undefeated record resulting in the gold medal at the 2017 Massachusetts Special Olympics Winter Games.

120
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:20,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it further resolved that Mr. Scapperardi be invited to the future council meeting for the purpose of receiving an official

121
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:25,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Council commendation to commemorate this momentous achievement.

122
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:26,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

123
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:28,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

124
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:33,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to thank my colleague, Councilor Scott Pelley, as well, for joining me in bringing this resolution forward.

125
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,520
[SPEAKER_11]: It really feels as though it's a self-explanatory resolution.

126
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:45,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Stephen Scaparrotti is a gentleman who lives in our community, who was recently fortunate enough to win a gold medal in the Winter Games out in Auburn, Massachusetts.

127
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:46,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I had the

128
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,593
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunity of seeing Stephen a couple of weeks ago.

129
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:53,355
[SPEAKER_11]: And out of his pocket, he pulled his gold medal, and he wouldn't let me touch it or wear it.

130
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:57,397
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm hoping that when we bring him up here to give him his citation, he'll let me put it on, Mr. President.

131
00:08:57,457 --> 00:09:03,580
[SPEAKER_11]: But he's a great kid, and I think this is something that definitely deserves congratulations and accommodation, Mr. President.

132
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:10,484
[SPEAKER_11]: The eMark has been doing a great job in our community, and this is just one of the many services that they provide their clientele.

133
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to congratulate Stephen on his efforts and Stephen on his hard work.

134
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:20,724
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't keep individual statistics, but from what I understand, he was dominant in the four games that they went undefeated, Mr. President.

135
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:24,225
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution and move for approval.

136
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:24,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

137
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor Scott Pelley.

138
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,607
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank my fellow — thank you, Mr. President.

139
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:34,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank my fellow council, Mr. Knight, for bringing this forward.

140
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Stephen's a remarkable young man.

141
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that he's —

142
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:49,099
[SPEAKER_13]: He's embarking on the next chapter of his athletic prowess, which is the softball representation.

143
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:52,801
[SPEAKER_13]: He wants to make sure he wears his Method uniform proudly at practices.

144
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Great family, great young man.

145
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't wait to see him here.

146
00:09:57,443 --> 00:09:57,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

147
00:09:59,144 --> 00:09:59,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

148
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:01,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

149
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:04,868
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to congratulate Stephen on a great accomplishment.

150
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:06,804
[SPEAKER_15]: A great citizen.

151
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:07,905
[SPEAKER_15]: He does a lot in his community.

152
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:09,887
[SPEAKER_15]: He's the usher at the 4 p.m.

153
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:10,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Mass at St.

154
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:15,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Francis every Saturday, and he's an all-around good guy, so congratulations to Stephen.

155
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:17,974
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor De La Rosa.

156
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:20,136
[SPEAKER_18]: And he watches the council meetings.

157
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:20,797
[SPEAKER_18]: He does.

158
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:22,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Every Tuesday night.

159
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Stephen, you're a great American.

160
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:26,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, he is.

161
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,103
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Mox.

162
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:30,435
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

163
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:31,737
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

164
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:38,763
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I believe it was last year that he also, uh, won, uh, the same award, Mr. President.

165
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:43,427
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, so this is multiple awards by Steven.

166
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:55,157
[SPEAKER_17]: And as my council colleagues mentioned, um, he is, uh, worthy of, uh, uh, citation from this council and, um, uh, move approval, Mr. President.

167
00:10:56,083 --> 00:11:08,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and personally, I've known the Schiaparelli family and Steven since he was a little child, and I've seen him grow up into a very nice young man, and his family should be very proud of him.

168
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,473
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Knight and Schiaparelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

169
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:16,153
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

170
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:16,233
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

171
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:18,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

172
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:21,316
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-427, offered by Councilor Falco.

173
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:33,358
[SPEAKER_19]: be it resolved that the sidewalk in front of the parking lot at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital on Governor's Avenue be replaced or repaired in the interest of public safety.

174
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:34,419
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Falco.

175
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:35,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

176
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:44,784
[SPEAKER_15]: I received a number of calls this past week with regard to the sidewalk in front of the parking lot at Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

177
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:50,367
[SPEAKER_15]: When you're exiting the parking lot, if you take a left that side of the sidewalk all the way down to

178
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:52,909
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's around 200 Governors Ave.

179
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:56,270
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a stretch of sidewalk there that is in disrepair.

180
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,791
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really a trip hazard.

181
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:05,534
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a number of panels that the cement missing, it's been broken up over the years and it really needs to be replaced.

182
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:14,137
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to see if we can get the DPW out there to take a look, see what we can do to either repair it or replace it in the interest of public safety.

183
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:19,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, it's a trip hazard to anyone that's out there and especially with the

184
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:26,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Spring and summer months being here, there are many more people out walking around, and this needs to be addressed sooner than later.

185
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:34,080
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may, Councilor Carviello, I know when we talk about sidewalks a lot of times, we also talk about stumps.

186
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:45,822
[SPEAKER_15]: And so if I could amend the resolution to include if the DPW could also remove a stump in front of 27 Saunders Street in the interest of public safety as well.

187
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,063
[SPEAKER_15]: 27 Saunders Street, Mr. Clerk.

188
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:48,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

189
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:50,933
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor DelaRusso.

190
00:12:50,953 --> 00:13:07,464
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, while we're on the subject of sidewalks, it's been pointed out to me on more than one occasion that the sidewalks on Grove Street are at some points impassable when being traversed with a baby carriage or stroller.

191
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:17,370
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the Commissioner of Public Works would inspect those portions of the street and repair them accordingly,

192
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:20,456
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, the citizens would be deeply appreciative.

193
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:21,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

194
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:23,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Nice.

195
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:25,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

196
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:27,800
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you to councilor Falco for bringing this resolution forward.

197
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, the area in question that he speaks of was recently excavated, um, for the purpose of public utility upgrade.

198
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:42,148
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, that trench work was patched and now we have to wait one year, I believe, uh, until they come back and resurface the roadway.

199
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,549
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to get a copy of the,

200
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:47,015
[SPEAKER_11]: scheduled from the engineering department as to when that's going to take place as well.

201
00:13:47,035 --> 00:14:00,445
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd amend the paper asking the question to the engineering department as to when the stretch of Governor's Ave will be repaved and resurfaced as a result of the excavation work that was performed by the public utility.

202
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:08,471
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Falco as amended by Councilor DelaRusso and Councilor Knight.

203
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:12,034
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

204
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:17,235
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

205
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:19,277
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

206
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:33,006
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-428 offered by Vice President Marks, be it resolved that the MBTA assessment to the city of Medford for providing transportation services be discussed.

207
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:34,947
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Marks.

208
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:37,509
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

209
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:46,621
[SPEAKER_17]: For those who are not aware, the MBTA assesses the City of Medford each and every year off our cherry sheet, Mr. President.

210
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:54,048
[SPEAKER_17]: This year's assessment to the taxpayers of this community is $3,709,296 for services provided by the MBTA.

211
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:12,561
[SPEAKER_17]: Out of the 175 cities and towns that are in this local assistance fund, Meffitt has the sixth highest assessment in Massachusetts.

212
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:19,165
[SPEAKER_17]: The MBTA has over $66 million in tax-exempt property in the city of Meffitt.

213
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:23,487
[SPEAKER_17]: The Salem Street car bonds tax-exempt property is $2,904,200.

214
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:34,082
[SPEAKER_17]: And the Wellington properties is valued, assessed at $63,095,800.

215
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:42,765
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's a combined $66 million of tax-exempt property in the city here, Mr. President.

216
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:48,547
[SPEAKER_17]: The MBTA has four major sources of revenue.

217
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:56,395
[SPEAKER_17]: One being the fare blocks and T-passes that we all buy to use the train and buses and so forth.

218
00:15:56,995 --> 00:16:06,641
[SPEAKER_17]: The second is local municipal assessments, and that's the 3,709,000 I spoke about that the city of Meffitt is being charged this year.

219
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:17,728
[SPEAKER_17]: The third is 20% of the 5% sales tax, excluding meals tax, goes to operate the MBTA.

220
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:22,434
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's also a fourth, which is discretionary state assistance.

221
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:36,538
[SPEAKER_17]: That is when the MBTA is having a shortfall, the state is obligated to step in and fund whatever shortfall there is, Mr. President.

222
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:43,720
[SPEAKER_17]: So as you can see, as a Meffitt resident, if you are using the T, you're paying it to buy a T pass,

223
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:50,257
[SPEAKER_17]: You're paying it through the local municipal assessment, so that's the second way you're paying as a Meffitt resident.

224
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:55,642
[SPEAKER_17]: You're paying any time sales tax, so that's the third way you're paying, Mr. President.

225
00:16:56,023 --> 00:17:00,767
[SPEAKER_17]: So as a Meffitt resident, we're paying three times for the MBTA.

226
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:04,851
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, because our proximity to Boston

227
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:26,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Because of our transportation, we have great transportation in this community, we find ourselves being the hub of commuters on a daily basis that come to use Wellington, that come to use the commuter rail in West Method, and come to jump on our buses, including the express buses, into town.

228
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:33,948
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President, that Method residents, bearing the cost,

229
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:50,577
[SPEAKER_17]: in the form of this local municipal assessment that we enact legislation that would allow us to offset any assessed property that the MBTA has against our local assessment.

230
00:17:51,718 --> 00:18:00,083
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I'm not sure if this has ever been done before, Mr. President, but I offer tonight the following language be sent to the city solicitor

231
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:08,454
[SPEAKER_17]: for his input, then to our state delegation to file legislation to amend Chapter 161, Section 9 of the Mass General Laws.

232
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:32,516
[SPEAKER_17]: And the language is, and I can supply this to you, Mr. Clerk, beginning on July 1st, 2018, any city or town that contributes to the Mass Bay Transit Authority State and Local Assistance Fund, which has MBTA tax-exempt property located within said city or town, shall have 100% of the assessed value accredited against its share of the MBTA assessment.

233
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:38,699
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Mr. President, I would ask that that be sent to the city solicitor

234
00:18:39,153 --> 00:19:07,127
[SPEAKER_17]: to draft a formal ordinance, or actually probably a home rule petition in this case, Mr. President, and hopefully offset the assessment that we're being hit up as a community, almost $4 million for T-Access, while people in Winchester, Arlington, and all the surrounding communities are coming to our city, Mr. President, to use the T.

235
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:13,068
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, and move approval.

236
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:19,950
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

237
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,310
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

238
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:28,652
[SPEAKER_19]: Please record Councilor Knight as being in opposition.

239
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:32,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Negative.

240
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:37,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm concerned there'll be a negative impact on the extension of the Green Line with an adoption of such a matter.

241
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Council Member O'Karn.

242
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:45,309
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could just read back the exact resolution that we're voting on.

243
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:47,710
[SPEAKER_05]: The wording.

244
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Vice President, would you like to read that back, please?

245
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:50,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you'd do it one more time.

246
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:51,372
[SPEAKER_17]: I can read it out, yes.

247
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:51,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

248
00:19:52,832 --> 00:20:07,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Beginning on July 1st, 2018, any city or town that contributes to the Mass Bay Transit Authority State and Local Assistance Fund, which has MBTA tax-exempt property located within said city or town, shall have 100% of the assessed value

249
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:12,300
[SPEAKER_17]: accredited against its share of the MBTA assessment.

250
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:19,847
[SPEAKER_17]: So right now, we have over $66 million in tax-exempt property that's owned by the MBTA.

251
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:33,638
[SPEAKER_17]: We paid $3.7 million in a T assessment for T services, and I think we should be able to offset what we should be getting in in revenue from the MBTA against our assessment.

252
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

253
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:39,922
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Del Rosso.

254
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:52,691
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish to be marked in opposition on grounds that such a effort, if ever, uh, it would become fruit, uh, brought to fruition would create a financial mayhem and chaos in the Commonwealth.

255
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:53,531
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

256
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:55,412
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, would you please call the roll?

257
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:01,276
[SPEAKER_19]: It was done.

258
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:06,940
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Nunez, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

259
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:14,539
[SPEAKER_19]: and we're marking Councilor Knight as being in opposition and Councilor DelaRusso as being in opposition.

260
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,842
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

261
00:21:19,183 --> 00:21:19,943
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

262
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:29,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passed.

263
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:35,116
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-430 offered by Vice President Mox being resolved that the recent

264
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:39,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I'm sorry.

265
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:46,679
[SPEAKER_19]: 17.429, offered by Vice President Marks, be it resolved that the city's unaccounted for water and leak detection program be discussed.

266
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Marks.

267
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:50,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

268
00:21:52,283 --> 00:22:05,772
[SPEAKER_17]: We just had a meeting with the Water and Sewer Commissioners regarding the combining of the water and sewer enterprise account and also regarding the fixed charge

269
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:10,903
[SPEAKER_17]: that will be appearing on residents' bill coming this August of 2017.

270
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:19,005
[SPEAKER_17]: At the meeting, Mr. President, we discussed a number of issues, one being leak detection.

271
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:31,268
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to discuss tonight the fact that, I think it was about eight months ago, the mayor invited

272
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:49,781
[SPEAKER_17]: a private company up here to City Hall to give us a quick demonstration, thank you, quick demonstration on a product that's being used around this state.

273
00:22:50,522 --> 00:23:00,810
[SPEAKER_17]: And the product is installed, it's an acoustic whistling device that's installed on water meters, on water mains and gate valves

274
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:22,356
[SPEAKER_17]: between streets, and they're spaced out in a grid across the city, and the company would listen to the devices overnight, and they would be able to tell if there are leaks in particular areas and be able to pinpoint within a few feet where these leaks are coming from.

275
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:28,298
[SPEAKER_17]: And knowing, Mr. President, that this city right now has roughly 17 to 20%

276
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,652
[SPEAKER_17]: is unaccounted for water.

277
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:41,619
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's comprised of buildings in the city and fire hydrants that currently are not needed.

278
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:43,440
[SPEAKER_17]: That's considered unaccounted for.

279
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:46,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Water leaks is part of unaccounted for water.

280
00:23:47,544 --> 00:23:54,689
[SPEAKER_17]: And also the municipal and the school side, which currently are needed, but don't pay a water bill.

281
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,092
[SPEAKER_17]: That's also listed under unaccounted for water.

282
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:05,845
[SPEAKER_17]: And that comprises roughly 17 to 20% of what our entire water bill is in this community.

283
00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:15,549
[SPEAKER_17]: The city is also weighing in to purchase a $1 million leak detection system to reduce the amount of leakage in the pipes.

284
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:20,912
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would ask, Mr. President, tonight, if we can get an update on the company.

285
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:25,874
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it was Akalara Technologies.

286
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:31,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Ecolara Technologies that came before us and made a presentation many months back.

287
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:43,355
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's important, Mr. President, that we're charging rate payers in this community tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars for unaccounted for water.

288
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:56,443
[SPEAKER_17]: And if there's a technology out there that can help us and alert us to particular hot spots in the community where we are leaking a lot of water, I think it would be worth its weight, Mr. President.

289
00:24:57,097 --> 00:24:59,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Roughly 90% of the leaks don't surface.

290
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:04,140
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not like you see bubbling water and say, ha ha, there's a leak.

291
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,862
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a lot of underground leaks, Mr. President, that never surface.

292
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:26,750
[SPEAKER_17]: One company that attended the meeting also said that within a five year period, if we enacted this particular program, we could save about $5 million with leak detection, saving up to 15 million gallons of water annually.

293
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:51,546
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, Mr. President, it's only appropriate that we, on behalf of the ratepayers of this community, look any way we can, whether it's leak detection, whether it's I&I inflow and infiltration, where our sewer pipes are accepting groundwater, and that groundwater is being treated as raw sewage, costing the ratepayers millions of dollars a year, Mr. President.

294
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,628
[SPEAKER_17]: It's our obligation to move forward.

295
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:55,569
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have $7.5 million in an enterprise account

296
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,801
[SPEAKER_17]: that could be used for infrastructure improvements.

297
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:05,442
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see any reason why we don't move forward on this, Mr. President.

298
00:26:05,843 --> 00:26:20,247
[SPEAKER_17]: So that would be my resolve that we ask what happened to the technology that the mayor presented to us back some eight months ago, and what are we doing to help improve the leak detection in our community?

299
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

300
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:26,029
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion, Councilor Donald Berthiau.

301
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:38,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, that presentation was the last official act of my tenure as president of this body, and I wouldn't be surprised if it turned up in the budget in a matter of weeks.

302
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,177
[SPEAKER_18]: We hope it will.

303
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:41,257
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Nyeth.

304
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:42,998
[SPEAKER_19]: Second the motion, Mr. President.

305
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:45,479
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Marks.

306
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:47,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address for the record, please.

307
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,041
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party.

308
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:55,723
[SPEAKER_01]: My records that I have dating back when I was in the council go back to 2010.

309
00:26:57,385 --> 00:26:58,626
[SPEAKER_01]: when this proposal was made.

310
00:26:58,926 --> 00:27:10,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And the very first proposal was made by David Hatzell, who was a city engineer some multiple years ago, 20 years ago, when he got involved in an I&I program that saved the city approximately a million gallons of water per day.

311
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:21,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, subsequent to that period of time, up until now, you've had loans, grant loans, from the MWRA that either were interest-free or minimum

312
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:26,594
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of them have ranged anywhere from $5 million to $3.5 million.

313
00:27:27,274 --> 00:27:34,357
[SPEAKER_01]: The sad part about all of this, as Councilor Moxley alluded to, is the fact that you have unaccounted for water in this city, which ranges anywhere from 17, 18, 19, 20%.

314
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really has the final handle on that.

315
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:49,582
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a lot of services in this community that are using our water for which taxpayers, city taxpayers are paying for, and that's unfair too.

316
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:57,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you folks just passed, I believe it was last week, the combining of your water and sewer accounts together.

317
00:27:58,453 --> 00:28:16,800
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would suggest as an addendum to the resolution tonight, that a request be made to your city solicitor for the purposes of, since these have now been merged together, can those monies be used for any other enterprises or any other general expenditures within your enterprise fund?

318
00:28:17,747 --> 00:28:33,736
[SPEAKER_01]: checking this out with other states, and every state does it different as it relates to enterprise funds, I think it's important to note, because if you have merged these two accounts together financially, and where one has a deficit in one year and one might have an excess in another year, it would be very

319
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:36,468
[SPEAKER_01]: convenient to offset one from the other.

320
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:37,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't know.

321
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:39,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Every state does it different.

322
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:58,025
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it would behoove you to check this out with your city solicitor as to how the methods merging of its water and sewer account is used as it relates to any other fund, general fund, enterprise funds, general revenue account funds that the city has, because in some states, they're allowed to take the excess profit.

323
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:02,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you folks, just as a reminder, what took place last week,

324
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:13,352
[SPEAKER_01]: You were told at a meeting by Mr. Fox and by the chairman of the Water and Sewer Commission that the water rates are going to be reduced by approximately 3% this year, by approximately 3%.

325
00:29:13,912 --> 00:29:17,333
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, they're going to be introducing what they call a connectivity fee.

326
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:28,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And the connectivity fee is going to be going toward pipe size coming into your house, anywhere from a half inch up to 10 inches, depending whether you're residential or whether you're a commercial.

327
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:35,515
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important to note that I think the chairman of the board said, well, we're not going to call it connectivity.

328
00:29:35,535 --> 00:29:36,716
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to call it baseline.

329
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:40,097
[SPEAKER_01]: But baseline already has its position.

330
00:29:40,137 --> 00:29:44,259
[SPEAKER_01]: It has its position within the Mass General Laws under chapter 60.

331
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:46,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it here?

332
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,282
[SPEAKER_01]: It's under chapter 65, chapter 165, section 2B, where it talks about baseline having an effect

333
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,020
[SPEAKER_01]: on a city or town which does not reflect upon connectivity.

334
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:06,283
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes against large consumer use or the rate of use in the community, whether it goes up or down.

335
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:10,825
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something you as a council need to get, that's got to be corrected.

336
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:21,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, I wish somebody from the Water and Sewer Department were here, chairman or otherwise, to explain this connectivity fee because I think as we all know, people are looking at it as another fee.

337
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:25,030
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you be charging another fee on a bimonthly basis when in fact,

338
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:27,096
[SPEAKER_01]: your water rates are going down by 3%.

339
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:39,387
[SPEAKER_01]: But since, in fact, I believe it was alleged that there is a deficit on the sewer department side, and now with the merging of the water and sewer accounts together, I think the second question needs to be asked.

340
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:48,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Can the excess from one, which would be the revenue, the profit, or the excess money on that, can you use it to offset the deficit from one to the other?

341
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:50,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you look at the merging of the two,

342
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:54,509
[SPEAKER_01]: It incorporates all your vehicles.

343
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:59,511
[SPEAKER_01]: It incorporates your employees, equipment, salaries, and everything else that goes along with it.

344
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:03,272
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there is a benefit to what Councilor Marks is alluding.

345
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:16,117
[SPEAKER_01]: But more importantly, I don't think that the Medford taxpayer, knowing that there's over $7.5 million in excess account in this particular area, should be taken for the ride of saying, hey,

346
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,223
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're right, Councilor Moxon, it's up to 21%.

347
00:31:19,603 --> 00:31:27,591
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever it is, there should be a full accounting of the water and the metering of the water and how it's being distributed here in the city of Medford.

348
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:29,593
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we all run businesses.

349
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably some people use more water than others.

350
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:40,984
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going to go that route and you're going to start charging people for the size of their water meter coming in, water pipe coming in,

351
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:47,564
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's going to have a profound effect on each and every taxpayer here in the city of Medford, because that's going to be on a bimonthly charge.

352
00:31:48,084 --> 00:31:58,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the enterprise fund will tell you, and all you have to do is look up other states and other cities and towns and how the merging of enterprise funds, what you can and cannot do with them.

353
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:01,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a whole host of activities.

354
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:06,669
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in Winchester, they have an enterprise fund, but they also have an enterprise activity account fund.

355
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:09,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, trying to get a handle on that.

356
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It also deals with recreation.

357
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:12,233
[SPEAKER_01]: and a whole host of other things.

358
00:32:12,654 --> 00:32:19,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, Winchester's a town and not a city, but it's the intent and it's the purpose of the legislation and the merger that is written.

359
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:32,301
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would suggest that one of you make this request of the city solicitor, just what, in fact, does this enterprise fund, now that it's merged together, water and sewer, allow the city of Medford to do with those monies?

360
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:33,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they transfer them?

361
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:34,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they merge them?

362
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:36,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they be used to offset?

363
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:46,288
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem logical or with any sense of common sense that you could be having a profit in the water side and you have a deficit on the sewer side.

364
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:49,090
[SPEAKER_01]: But to this day, you haven't been able to offset it.

365
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:59,340
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're going to be doing is charging a connectivity fee on your pipeline coming in, which supposedly will offset the sewer charge according to what was told you last week.

366
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,462
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you're going to be reducing your water rate by 3%.

367
00:33:03,702 --> 00:33:05,344
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot for people to understand.

368
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:12,849
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any sense at all, especially when you're sitting on seven and a half million dollars, whether you want to call it surplus, reserve, or whatever it might be.

369
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:15,451
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a huge issue that's before you right now.

370
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:20,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than your tax bill, it's the next biggest thing that the citizen of this community has to deal with.

371
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:24,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for an example, relative to a connectivity fee.

372
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:31,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And your town of Stoneham, which is right across the border, they just have a one-time connectivity charge.

373
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:39,979
[SPEAKER_01]: New house going up, new resident, new line going in, $50 for a residential unit, up to one to five units.

374
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And anything over that in a commercial, it's $1,000 hookup.

375
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:44,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it might be.

376
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,560
[SPEAKER_01]: One-inch service is $500.

377
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,121
[SPEAKER_01]: A one- to two-inch service is $750.

378
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:51,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And a two-inch service or above is $1,000.

379
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:54,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Numbers are a lot lower than what's being proposed here.

380
00:33:54,507 --> 00:34:00,191
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a one-time fee, and that fee is at the discretion of the Director of Public Works and the City of Stoneham.

381
00:34:00,691 --> 00:34:02,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Every city and town does it different.

382
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:02,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.

383
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:22,245
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's hard to explain to the Mr. and Mrs. Medford resident that when you just gave them a new tax increase in their bill, when you're hitting them with a CPA tax, Community Preservation Act tax, for which the Commonwealth will not even meet its obligation to match the dollar for dollar that each rate payer is paying,

384
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what the people voted on under that assumption.

385
00:34:25,535 --> 00:34:27,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you may be hitting them with a connectivity fee.

386
00:34:27,596 --> 00:34:28,496
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not fair.

387
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:42,023
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Councilor Marks has alluded to, and hopefully the council will go along with it, I really think you need a complete assessment of all the water, all the sewer usage here in the city of Metro to get a better handle as it relates to what's going on.

388
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:47,165
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a shame that your Water and Sewer Commissioners do not appear before this board to explain this.

389
00:34:47,706 --> 00:34:50,067
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really an involved process.

390
00:34:50,897 --> 00:34:53,758
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're once again hitting the rate payers with another fee.

391
00:34:54,198 --> 00:35:01,239
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would assume that that would be very hard to explain, very hard to explain when you're sitting on $7.5 million profit at the present time.

392
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:02,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

393
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,700
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

394
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,160
[SPEAKER_19]: Counselor Knight.

395
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

396
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:11,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I do believe we had a two-hour meeting on this topic last week.

397
00:35:12,502 --> 00:35:19,623
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly support Counselor Knox's resolution relative to a leak detection program for our unaccounted

398
00:35:20,114 --> 00:35:21,895
[SPEAKER_11]: water in our community, Mr. President.

399
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I move for approval on the paper as filed.

400
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:26,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Member Kern.

401
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Carviello.

402
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I too move approval.

403
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:43,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a leak detection program for unaccounted for water is something that we voted for many times over the last several years, and I believe it is in the works, and I hope that we do move forward with that, and I thank Council Member Max for bringing that forward.

404
00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:48,012
[SPEAKER_05]: With regards to what Councilor Pinto said, I too agree.

405
00:35:48,032 --> 00:35:49,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not happy with the

406
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:55,156
[SPEAKER_05]: connectivity fee that was voted on by the Water and Sewer Commissioners.

407
00:35:55,236 --> 00:36:01,101
[SPEAKER_05]: But last week at our meeting, it did make it much more clear, and we were able to ask questions.

408
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:07,246
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't almost an hour and a half meeting, but we were able to better understand what is taking place.

409
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:14,032
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though it is very confusing, it was good to know that the water rate will not be going up.

410
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:17,435
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the connectivity fee.

411
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:18,953
[SPEAKER_05]: is put in place.

412
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:21,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess a number of other cities and towns have it.

413
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:23,575
[SPEAKER_05]: We were kind of behind the eight ball on it.

414
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,016
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think any of us maybe are happy about it.

415
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:29,197
[SPEAKER_05]: But the water rate is going down 3%.

416
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:37,560
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's almost a way we have this number that we have to meet every year with regards to how much we are going to owe the MWRA.

417
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's almost a different way to calculate it.

418
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:44,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said in the meeting, I'm not worried about the next year.

419
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:47,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope that the Water and Sewer Commission, like they stated to us,

420
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:53,561
[SPEAKER_05]: at last week's meeting always keeps it so we're not getting excess from our rate payers.

421
00:36:54,022 --> 00:37:07,112
[SPEAKER_05]: My worry is that we one day will have a Water and Sewer Commission that maybe doesn't see it that way and uses the fee as well as the rate to increase what we're charging our rate payers.

422
00:37:07,152 --> 00:37:13,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that I am worried about, although we don't have a say on what the Water and Sewer Commission does and how they vote.

423
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it would be important,

424
00:37:17,254 --> 00:37:30,580
[SPEAKER_05]: They were there for two hours last week, and it was hard to ask them to come to our meeting to explain this live to the people who are watching at home and the people that have called us or emailed us with concerns after they heard of the vote for the fee.

425
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:41,105
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's important to kind of, as counselors, let them know what we did talk about, that our worries were at ease to a point because we met last week.

426
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:45,967
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's something that I, as one counselor, wanted to let the public know, but I do see

427
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:50,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Pinto's points and I think Councillor Marks are putting this forward.

428
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:58,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one day we will be able to get the Water and Sewer Commissioners here just to explain it more in depth for the public to understand.

429
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:12,048
[SPEAKER_05]: One point on that though is we did request that the Water and Sewer Commission put this explanation within one of the next Water and Sewer bills and I think that's really important because when we did find out about the vote

430
00:38:12,914 --> 00:38:15,717
[SPEAKER_05]: that's when, you know, people started getting concerned.

431
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:28,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So something within the next bill or two, letting them know prior to this fee that they're going to see on their bill, letting them know what this vote means, that the rate is going down, that the fee is in place and why it's in place.

432
00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:29,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's very important.

433
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:31,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

434
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:35,434
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion, name and address of the record, please.

435
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:39,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew cast an anti Christian street method, Massachusetts,

436
00:38:40,428 --> 00:38:43,590
[SPEAKER_16]: The ex-counselor brought up some good points about this issue.

437
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:52,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Why would we merge the water accounts, the income and the sewerage?

438
00:38:54,596 --> 00:39:06,482
[SPEAKER_16]: I can understand, as it was stated, for making a simpler accountant to be one number combined instead of two numbers.

439
00:39:08,815 --> 00:39:15,480
[SPEAKER_16]: But my concern is, will this ever hurt us, the payer, because of this combination?

440
00:39:17,901 --> 00:39:22,625
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if anyone has that answer, or I could guarantee that answer either.

441
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:35,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Number two, this connectivity fee, is this a one-time charge at the town next to us, or is this a yearly fee, or biannually?

442
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:37,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Does anyone know that?

443
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:39,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Langelgren.

444
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:45,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was a yearly fee that you'll be paying bimonthly within your bill.

445
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:54,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So depending on the pipe, you're charged, say, $50 for the year, but you pay it divided by six per bill.

446
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:56,864
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'd pay $7 per pay period.

447
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:59,206
[SPEAKER_16]: For a total of one year or continuously?

448
00:39:59,446 --> 00:40:00,667
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be for one year.

449
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:02,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be continued.

450
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:04,410
[SPEAKER_05]: The Water and Soil Commission voted this in.

451
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it yearly?

452
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:09,105
[SPEAKER_16]: After the first year, it will continue as a yearly extra cost.

453
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:10,806
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a yearly cost.

454
00:40:10,946 --> 00:40:15,849
[SPEAKER_05]: The Water and Sewer Commission would argue whether it's an increased cost, because they lowered the rate.

455
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,971
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is not a one-time charge for 12 months.

456
00:40:20,031 --> 00:40:22,633
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be done continuously after the year is over.

457
00:40:22,873 --> 00:40:26,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, unless the Water and Sewer Commission changes their vote at some point.

458
00:40:27,035 --> 00:40:28,576
[SPEAKER_19]: It will help provide a revenue stream for the water and sewer.

459
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:29,496
[SPEAKER_16]: As it stands right now.

460
00:40:29,516 --> 00:40:30,517
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, thank you.

461
00:40:33,385 --> 00:40:49,054
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the information councilor night prior to last week's meeting with the council, the water and sewer commission had their monthly meeting and I attended that monthly meeting and at the monthly meeting they had a draft letter that they were passing around and they voted on including this draft letter in your upcoming bill.

462
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:55,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they just want to put the finishing touches on it and make sure it reads smoothly, but you will see a breakdown and an explanation within your next bill.

463
00:40:56,338 --> 00:41:00,421
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm authored by the water and sewer commission and Ron Baker.

464
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:01,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

465
00:41:01,722 --> 00:41:02,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Counselor.

466
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:11,886
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, point number two, why a connection fee if we're already connected to our water lines?

467
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:17,148
[SPEAKER_16]: I can understand for new construction, there must be fees to hook it up to the street.

468
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,768
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're already connected.

469
00:41:18,828 --> 00:41:27,411
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of see why, in a fair way, you would add such a fee, or the state did, or the NWRA.

470
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:31,953
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say, why not simply raise the usage rate

471
00:41:32,504 --> 00:41:45,587
[SPEAKER_16]: only if needed, because we're used to that every so many years, and it doesn't condolute the issue by having a connectivity fee forever and a day.

472
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:50,028
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, I can't understand it.

473
00:41:50,388 --> 00:42:01,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Unless some water meters are not being used, and they're basically trying to get a connectivity fee yearly, even if they use zero cubic feet of water, like

474
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:11,705
[SPEAKER_16]: The gas, natural gas has a supply side, and with all their hundreds of sentences, we'll need to try to decipher their bills.

475
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:26,137
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't seem fair, and I'm concerned it's gonna cost us not only in combination fees, but there might be extra costs, there might be a method to the reasoning here that might cost us greatly in the future.

476
00:42:27,398 --> 00:42:31,602
[SPEAKER_16]: And the connectivity fee, I can't understand that unless we're gonna do

477
00:42:32,907 --> 00:42:33,687
[SPEAKER_16]: a new connection.

478
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:35,789
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for this.

479
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:40,071
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Council Mark seconded by Councilor Knight.

480
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:41,191
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor.

481
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:41,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

482
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:43,433
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

483
00:42:45,053 --> 00:42:47,135
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to spend the rules by Councilor Knight.

484
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:57,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Fees and the merging of the water and sewer accounts.

485
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to take that paper up, Mr. President and adopt the committee report.

486
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:00,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

487
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:15,924
[SPEAKER_19]: 17 of 422 committee for of the whole meeting report may 2nd, 2017 on the water and soil commission connection fees, merging of the water and sewer accounts and other issues.

488
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:25,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, the, um, Memphis city council made recommendations that the city audit to prepare the sources of revenue in the water and sewer enterprise account and provide that breakdown to the council.

489
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:35,186
[SPEAKER_11]: and the Memphis City Council also requested that the mayor report back to the council on the status of the proposed leak detection program and equipment requested by the Water and Sewer Commission.

490
00:43:35,806 --> 00:43:41,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Upon a motion by one of the councilors, the meeting report was reported out of committee and passed.

491
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:45,072
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee report was included on our packet today, and I move for adoption of such, Mr. President.

492
00:43:45,092 --> 00:43:46,593
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

493
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:50,436
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

494
00:43:51,016 --> 00:43:51,716
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

495
00:43:51,736 --> 00:43:51,796
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

496
00:43:53,057 --> 00:43:54,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

497
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:55,379
[SPEAKER_19]: While we're under suspension,

498
00:43:56,315 --> 00:43:57,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Reports of the committee.

499
00:43:57,396 --> 00:44:07,324
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-421, Committee of the Whole meeting report, April 25, 2017, on Clipper Ship Connection.

500
00:44:08,986 --> 00:44:09,726
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Nice.

501
00:44:11,908 --> 00:44:13,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Mr. President.

502
00:44:13,129 --> 00:44:24,679
[SPEAKER_11]: The Memphis City Council met at the Committee of the Whole on April 25th to discuss the proposed Clipper Ship Connection program, specifically the part between the Crystal Campbell Parkway and Riverbend Park.

503
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:44,111
[SPEAKER_11]: There were recommendations that were made at this, that the DPW commissioner examined the stretch of land proposed for the path and address any safety concerns, that the commission hold a meeting with the abutters and residents of the area to address these concerns before the public hearing, that the engineer look at any quick fix improvements for pedestrian safety along Riverside Ave, Mr. President.

504
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:50,595
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee report requested that the committee report be reported out and the matter be reviewed in another 90 days.

505
00:44:50,975 --> 00:44:51,895
[SPEAKER_11]: The meeting adjourned at 7 39 PM.

506
00:44:53,464 --> 00:44:56,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Since that time, Mr. President, it's been brought to my attention that

507
00:44:57,337 --> 00:45:10,846
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been some environmental concerns in the area based upon some research that's been done over there, but it's also my understanding that those environmental concerns can be fixed and there is a strong potential that the proposed Clippership connection will move forward as designed.

508
00:45:11,906 --> 00:45:23,474
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee of the whole meeting included a presentation by Kyle Hagland from the DCR who assured the community that design alternatives will be made to the initial proposal.

509
00:45:23,694 --> 00:45:25,695
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a number of residents that were present that evening.

510
00:45:25,991 --> 00:45:29,792
[SPEAKER_11]: It has some concerns about the distance of the proposed path to their private property.

511
00:45:30,972 --> 00:45:37,975
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been other projects in other communities where they've had the same concerns, and they've been able to iron those concerns out, Mr. President, through what we call working together.

512
00:45:37,995 --> 00:45:42,436
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm hopeful that these issues will be resolved and the Clippership Connector can move forward.

513
00:45:43,276 --> 00:45:50,338
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, however, Mr. President, I'd move to adopt the committee report, and I look forward to our meeting in what would now be 83 days.

514
00:45:53,123 --> 00:45:53,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

515
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

516
00:45:55,265 --> 00:46:02,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Before we approve this, I know there are actually a number of people here tonight that wanted to talk about this topic.

517
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:04,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Falco yields the floor to the residents.

518
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:09,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address for the record, please.

519
00:46:10,257 --> 00:46:12,419
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Matthew Bell, 37 Fells Avenue.

520
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:13,519
[SPEAKER_19]: And the young lady?

521
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:15,341
[SPEAKER_19]: Say your name.

522
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:17,443
[SPEAKER_19]: If you could put the mic down for her to help her out.

523
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:20,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Say your name.

524
00:46:20,565 --> 00:46:21,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Violet.

525
00:46:22,286 --> 00:46:22,646
[SPEAKER_19]: Violet?

526
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:23,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Violet who?

527
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:24,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Bell.

528
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:25,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Violet.

529
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:28,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Violet Bell, also at 37 Phelps Avenue.

530
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:30,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to talk first, or do you want me to talk first?

531
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:30,994
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

532
00:46:31,014 --> 00:46:39,121
[SPEAKER_03]: We just wanted to add our two cents about the bike path and give you just a short story about our experience living in the city of Jerusalem.

533
00:46:39,161 --> 00:46:42,745
[SPEAKER_03]: We lived there from 2010 to 2013 before we moved to Medford.

534
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:44,266
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I got the hat.

535
00:46:44,486 --> 00:46:48,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a Middle East correspondent for WGBH, the world's public radio program.

536
00:46:49,588 --> 00:46:53,331
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jerusalem, as you probably have heard, can be a stressful place.

537
00:46:54,191 --> 00:47:03,177
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we moved there, we were delighted to find out that just after we moved, they finished a bike path right in our neighborhood that went right down the street to the kids' school.

538
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:21,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the three years that we lived there, despite all the stresses, my wife and I look back at our time there and the bike path always comes up as this fantastic thing about the quality of life there.

539
00:47:21,902 --> 00:47:22,463
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact is

540
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:34,338
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the fact that we could get up in the morning, get the kids on bikes, ride about a mile down the path, you know, with not going on traffic, getting to school, then pick them up, we'd ride back.

541
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:48,807
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, it's something that I think a lot of people, if they don't, if they don't bike commute, you might not realize how huge that is for a family and how, what a huge thing for the quality of life that is.

542
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:50,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Violet has a very short speech.

543
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:54,783
[SPEAKER_19]: Violet, would you like to come up here where it's a little shorter for her, where she can read it a little easier?

544
00:47:54,803 --> 00:47:56,043
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you like to come up here and read?

545
00:47:56,363 --> 00:47:58,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you want to read from over there?

546
00:48:00,504 --> 00:48:03,165
[SPEAKER_03]: You two are nervous.

547
00:48:04,605 --> 00:48:05,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's all right.

548
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,386
[SPEAKER_03]: We can send an email to John.

549
00:48:07,806 --> 00:48:10,667
[SPEAKER_19]: If you like, I'll be happy to read it for her, if she'd like me to read it for her.

550
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:14,408
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want him to read it, Violet?

551
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:15,489
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you very much.

552
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:16,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

553
00:48:18,217 --> 00:48:19,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

554
00:48:19,558 --> 00:48:25,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Bruce Kulik, 168 Grove Street in Medford, and also the vice chair of the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission.

555
00:48:25,982 --> 00:48:27,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanted to make two points.

556
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:37,068
[SPEAKER_09]: One is the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission voted several meetings ago to actually endorse this project, and we are looking forward to it moving forward.

557
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make sure that people were aware of that.

558
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:42,736
[SPEAKER_09]: The second, um, I was not actually at the committee, the whole meeting.

559
00:48:42,776 --> 00:48:50,606
[SPEAKER_09]: So perhaps this information didn't come up there, but it was just misreported, but it was alleged that the path would be traversing private property.

560
00:48:51,347 --> 00:48:53,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And from all the analysis we've done in looking at

561
00:48:54,785 --> 00:49:08,851
[SPEAKER_09]: the city assessor records and so forth, what we have seen is that the path itself, in fact, will not be traversing any private property, but rather an amalgam of city, DCR, highway department,

562
00:49:09,912 --> 00:49:19,396
[SPEAKER_09]: and land that's under the control of the, I believe the Medford Housing Department, as well as one private development for which the Commonwealth has an easement.

563
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:28,779
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's our belief that we have all the property in place as long as each of those government agencies is willing to be able to go forward with it.

564
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to clarify that.

565
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:34,414
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

566
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:39,877
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the issue was the distance that the proposed pathway was from private property at some spots.

567
00:49:39,937 --> 00:49:44,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it was stated that it would be less than six feet, six feet from private property.

568
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:47,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I misspoke when I gave my presentation.

569
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:57,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe that there are some stretches that are fairly narrow, but nonetheless are wide enough for the path to be placed and to provide an adequate buffer to the property.

570
00:49:57,989 --> 00:50:02,912
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's clearly something the design team will be looking at to make sure that that fits properly.

571
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:04,790
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

572
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:06,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

573
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:06,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

574
00:50:10,212 --> 00:50:11,253
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address for the record, please.

575
00:50:11,273 --> 00:50:12,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Castaneda, Andrew.

576
00:50:12,273 --> 00:50:13,093
[SPEAKER_16]: The man's right.

577
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:23,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Usually when the city comes up with an idea, I'm not usually for it because it might cost us money or aggravation or a combination thereof sometimes.

578
00:50:24,218 --> 00:50:34,062
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I believe we in East Meffitt deserve this as a connection to West Meffitt all the way through to Assembly Road

579
00:50:35,164 --> 00:50:36,806
[SPEAKER_16]: so I can continue my bike path.

580
00:50:40,148 --> 00:50:51,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, I must say, Route 93 got sound barriers on the west side, but the other child on my side, east forward, we never got any sound barriers.

581
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:59,666
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're gonna give it to one child, you should give it to both childs, or else Paul did not bring any presents home whatsoever for Christmas.

582
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:02,148
[SPEAKER_16]: That's only my opinion, of course.

583
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:05,388
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome, Councilor Del Rosso.

584
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:11,533
[SPEAKER_16]: So why not us in East Medford?

585
00:51:12,814 --> 00:51:31,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides, there is a law, I believe it goes back to 1647, Cuomo of the Massachusetts, probably the oldest law in the 13 colonies, that states we the people have egress rights to walk along waterways,

586
00:51:32,343 --> 00:51:36,966
[SPEAKER_16]: up to 20 feet, I believe, above high mean high tide.

587
00:51:39,068 --> 00:51:46,753
[SPEAKER_16]: So if properties were built close to the waterway, that's a nice amenity for them to have in the real estate business.

588
00:51:48,054 --> 00:51:56,460
[SPEAKER_16]: However, the Supreme Court also backed up this law on Cape Cod with Smith and Wesson's Peninsula down in Kituit.

589
00:51:58,622 --> 00:52:00,463
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the people's right of way.

590
00:52:02,064 --> 00:52:06,625
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope it goes forward as it should, as in West Medford.

591
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:07,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

592
00:52:07,985 --> 00:52:08,805
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Kessing.

593
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:11,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

594
00:52:12,346 --> 00:52:14,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Jason Eastman, 204 Fells Avenue.

595
00:52:14,026 --> 00:52:19,167
[SPEAKER_14]: As a daily bike commuter, I just wanted to express my full support for this project.

596
00:52:19,207 --> 00:52:28,388
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a great idea for the health of the community, the health of the city, and for just the infrastructure and everything.

597
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:30,829
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for all the support.

598
00:52:31,229 --> 00:52:31,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

599
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:33,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Member O'Karen.

600
00:52:34,675 --> 00:52:37,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll yield to the speakers at the podium.

601
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:38,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

602
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm Martha Andrus.

603
00:52:41,262 --> 00:52:48,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 45 Kilgore Avenue in West Medford, and I just wanted to go on record that I think the bike path is a great idea.

604
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:50,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even own a bike.

605
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:54,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm 68 years old, and I like a lot of older people.

606
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:56,806
[SPEAKER_04]: In Medford, I like to walk places.

607
00:52:57,046 --> 00:53:00,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like to get in the car and have to park and so forth.

608
00:53:00,727 --> 00:53:05,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to point out, it's not just the bike people who use the bike path.

609
00:53:06,148 --> 00:53:11,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I live in West Medford, I'm right up against DCR property along the river.

610
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:13,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love it.

611
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:15,369
[SPEAKER_04]: My husband and I sit on our porch.

612
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:17,670
[SPEAKER_04]: We watch people go by.

613
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,630
[SPEAKER_04]: We watch wildlife.

614
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:22,909
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a real pleasure.

615
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:27,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to say bike paths are something I'm very interested in.

616
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:28,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

617
00:53:29,232 --> 00:53:31,073
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

618
00:53:31,553 --> 00:53:32,253
Thank you.

619
00:53:33,594 --> 00:53:37,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

620
00:53:37,455 --> 00:53:38,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily Stein, 177 High Street.

621
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:41,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also here to support the Clippership Connector.

622
00:53:42,538 --> 00:53:46,719
[SPEAKER_06]: My husband and I walked the goat path that currently exists there a couple of years ago.

623
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:50,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just the most beautiful part of Medford I'd seen.

624
00:53:51,482 --> 00:54:02,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think for us to own this beauty of a river that we have in our front yard, in our backyard, it's something that I think more people need to see and need to appreciate.

625
00:54:04,513 --> 00:54:14,721
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing is this .5, .6 mile stretch that we're talking about is what connects us to Wellington Station, which connects us to Boston.

626
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:19,805
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the T. So people can walk to the T or cycle to the T and be connected.

627
00:54:20,445 --> 00:54:25,329
[SPEAKER_06]: It also can take us all the way out to Minuteman Bike Trail, which could take us out to Concord.

628
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:29,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So really, this is the missing link.

629
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:40,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And especially seeing now that DCR is working on that side of the river, that was another missing link that goes by Whole Foods and 16.

630
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a parent of two little kids, I am too scared to cycle on the road.

631
00:54:46,385 --> 00:54:49,547
[SPEAKER_06]: But seeing that go in, this is our ticket to, like,

632
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,804
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of healthy, wonderful rides ahead of us.

633
00:54:54,304 --> 00:54:58,709
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for having us here, and it's great to hear people's support.

634
00:54:59,149 --> 00:55:03,994
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is something where every age would benefit.

635
00:55:04,615 --> 00:55:05,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Senior citizens can walk.

636
00:55:06,983 --> 00:55:10,625
[SPEAKER_06]: more than just beyond the building that exists there.

637
00:55:11,665 --> 00:55:15,767
[SPEAKER_06]: It would also bring in a lot of traffic to Medford Square.

638
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:19,589
[SPEAKER_06]: We have this lack of foot traffic coming through.

639
00:55:19,669 --> 00:55:29,813
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you think of the economic benefits of people coming in from the city, people coming in from Arlington, from Concord, there could be cafes.

640
00:55:30,173 --> 00:55:33,615
[SPEAKER_06]: When you see all the places along the bike path in Lexington and Arlington,

641
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,726
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of business from people using the bike path.

642
00:55:37,746 --> 00:55:40,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's something that can also come to Medford.

643
00:55:40,328 --> 00:55:40,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

644
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:41,489
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

645
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,632
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address for the record, please.

646
00:55:45,652 --> 00:55:46,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Jen Valentine.

647
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:48,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in West Medford on Warren Street.

648
00:55:49,535 --> 00:55:51,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm happy to be here.

649
00:55:51,517 --> 00:55:56,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I moved from San Francisco, where it's a big biking and walking community.

650
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's outdoors.

651
00:55:57,801 --> 00:55:58,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're healthy-er.

652
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:12,028
[SPEAKER_07]: And coming back here, I grew up here, but I was kind of shocked at how many cars there are and the decrease in children getting driven to school.

653
00:56:12,348 --> 00:56:24,378
[SPEAKER_07]: And the statistics show, like in the 60s, we're probably the last of the free-range kids, but more than half of the kids when we grew up walked and biked to school, like 12%.

654
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:31,180
[SPEAKER_07]: took a car and now it's 58% that get driven and like 12% walk.

655
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So the statistics have changed.

656
00:56:32,821 --> 00:56:34,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So I love this idea.

657
00:56:34,701 --> 00:56:40,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It opens up a path for the children to bike and to walk and also the seniors that are right there.

658
00:56:41,003 --> 00:56:45,144
[SPEAKER_07]: They can also use the pathway and I support it.

659
00:56:45,304 --> 00:56:47,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to throw my two cents in.

660
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:48,225
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

661
00:56:48,465 --> 00:56:48,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

662
00:56:49,545 --> 00:56:50,345
[SPEAKER_19]: Counselor Longo-Kern.

663
00:56:50,985 --> 00:56:52,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Carviello.

664
00:56:53,606 --> 00:56:57,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really beneficial to have the meeting we had a couple weeks ago.

665
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:00,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we realized how many people were in support.

666
00:57:00,652 --> 00:57:04,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And it definitely educated the council with regards to how the process is going to move forward.

667
00:57:05,396 --> 00:57:08,018
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe, I don't think it's in the committee report.

668
00:57:08,038 --> 00:57:08,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to make sure.

669
00:57:09,419 --> 00:57:19,828
[SPEAKER_05]: One big thing we did learn is the lack of communication between the direct abutters and whether it be city hall or the consultant that's going to do the design.

670
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:21,590
[SPEAKER_05]: We realized there really was a,

671
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:27,134
[SPEAKER_05]: an issue and residents need to be more aware and more included in the process.

672
00:57:27,254 --> 00:57:29,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make sure that's on the committee report.

673
00:57:30,015 --> 00:57:45,522
[SPEAKER_05]: We did ask that the, whether it be the city representatives or the consultant design consultant meets with each individual butter to figure out a way to create buffer zones or figure out that everybody's concerns and questions and how we can make it

674
00:57:46,484 --> 00:57:48,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody's very happy with the project.

675
00:57:48,426 --> 00:57:54,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we have the abutters on board, I think this whole community is going to be on board, and it's going to be so beneficial.

676
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:58,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And the residents who have already spoke are right.

677
00:57:58,793 --> 00:58:11,443
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to create the connection that we need, that we have been missing, and people are going to be able to traverse a number of different communities, but also our own Medford Square, which is extremely important for our commerce.

678
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:29,339
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to make sure that was on record that the design consultant, city administration, or department head that's involved with this does meet with each and every individual abutter and keeps them apprised throughout the process and figures out ways to make each abutter happy.

679
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:30,980
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the bottom line.

680
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully we can get that done and move forward on the project.

681
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:34,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

682
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:35,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Leif.

683
00:58:35,978 --> 00:58:37,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

684
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:38,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to comment on something Ms.

685
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:43,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Valentin said about the amount of people and the percentage of people that are walking to school or biking to school these days.

686
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:52,127
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that that's also a direct effect on big box education and the move away from neighborhood schools, Mr. President.

687
00:58:52,207 --> 00:58:55,208
[SPEAKER_11]: We used to have the Gleason School, the Hervey School, the Brooks School.

688
00:58:55,769 --> 00:58:56,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we have just the Brooks School.

689
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:01,912
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that as municipalities and government that provide educational services,

690
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:12,079
[SPEAKER_11]: have changed the way that they do business, we've seen an effect in our community on the amount of people that are willing to bike, or able to bike and walk to school because of the distances between our big box schools now.

691
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

692
00:59:15,501 --> 00:59:23,847
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Knight that we accept the paper in committee, seconded by Councilor Falco.

693
00:59:23,867 --> 00:59:24,407

01:02:17,386 --> 01:02:18,086
[SPEAKER_19]: If we could get them.

715
01:02:18,186 --> 01:02:27,532

[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

719
01:02:38,016 --> 01:02:38,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

720
01:02:39,076 --> 01:02:46,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I just asked that the city clerk make commemorative citations up for these eight individuals so that they could be presented at the retirement fund.

721
01:02:46,998 --> 01:02:47,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, he is.

[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

724
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:54,860
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

725
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:56,901
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

726
01:02:57,581 --> 01:02:58,541
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

727
01:02:59,561 --> 01:03:02,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to revert back to regular business. 17.

728
01:03:04,766 --> 01:03:21,796
[SPEAKER_19]: 430, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the recent response from the Medford Housing Authority regarding Council Resolution 17-318 relative to emergency preparedness for our senior disabled housing complexes be discussed.

729
01:03:22,397 --> 01:03:23,477
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Mox.

730
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:25,299
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

731
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:33,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Several weeks back, I offered a resolution, Paper 17-318, relative to emergency preparedness

732
01:03:34,305 --> 01:03:48,219
[SPEAKER_17]: and evacuation policies for our elderly, disabled, and families that currently reside in our over 843 units consisting of eight developments within this community.

733
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,104
[SPEAKER_17]: It was brought to my attention, Mr. President, and the reason why I offer the resolution

734
01:03:53,945 --> 01:04:17,196
[SPEAKER_17]: I received a call from a disabled woman living in one of our elderly disabled units, and during a power outage, being up on the fourth floor of the building, was unable to get down to the first floor, and was unable to use her lifeline because she had no power in the apartment, and had to stay put for a period of time.

735
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:22,359
[SPEAKER_17]: So I did get a response recently, and I'll pass this off to the city clerk,

736
01:04:23,149 --> 01:04:25,010
[SPEAKER_17]: from the Meffitt Housing Authority.

737
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:30,631
[SPEAKER_17]: And it is from Joseph McRitchie, who is the interim director.

738
01:04:31,131 --> 01:04:41,174
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make note, Mr. President, that the Housing Commission has just hired the new executive director, Attorney Jeff Driscoll, who took over just recently.

739
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:50,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, I want to thank Commissioner Mike Luongo for his quick response and action on this very important resolution, Mr. President.

740
01:04:50,693 --> 01:04:59,358
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could just read it, it's from the Meffitt Housing Authority dated May 1st, 2017, regarding City Council Resolution 17-318.

741
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:10,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Councilor Mox, thank you for the opportunity to update the Meffitt City Council on the status of the emergency preparedness at the Meffitt Housing Authority.

742
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:22,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Your inquiry has spurred the Housing Authority to take immediate steps to develop new and improved evacuation policies at each of our elderly and disabled complexes throughout the city.

743
01:05:23,308 --> 01:05:31,453
[SPEAKER_17]: It will be our intent to seek the input and assistance of the Medford Fire Department, Health Department, and other first aid responders within the city.

744
01:05:32,263 --> 01:05:42,151
[SPEAKER_17]: The first issue that you have raised is the question of whether our senior complexes are equipped with emergency generators to provide elevator service in the event of emergencies.

745
01:05:42,991 --> 01:05:56,602
[SPEAKER_17]: The Saul and Stahl building, which is the Meffitt Housing Authority's only senior building classified as a high-rise, is equipped with an emergency generator that provides elevator service as well as limited lighting in the event of loss of power.

746
01:05:57,342 --> 01:06:09,307
[SPEAKER_17]: Although the generator designed to automatically start when power is lost, it is my understanding that it did not so function in mid-March when a major power outage affected a large portion of Meffitt.

747
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:17,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Our generator contractor has assured us that the repairs have been made at the salt-and-stall generator to avoid a repeat in the future.

748
01:06:18,665 --> 01:06:27,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Other mid and low rise buildings at the Meffitt Housing Authority did not have emergency generators included when originally built or converted for housing.

749
01:06:28,469 --> 01:06:33,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Space limitations and financial constraints would make providing generators at this time very difficult.

750
01:06:34,212 --> 01:06:41,295
[SPEAKER_17]: Although Weldon Gardens is a five story building, the topography does allow access from the third floor as well as the first floor.

751
01:06:41,855 --> 01:06:48,378
[SPEAKER_17]: This does reduce the number of floors that those with mobility restrictions would need to traverse in an emergency.

752
01:06:50,033 --> 01:06:58,198
[SPEAKER_17]: On the more general issue of emergency evacuations at the buildings, the Medford Housing Authority has undertaken to establish a plan for each building.

753
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:18,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Similar to the information on the city's website provided by the health department, we are encouraging all residents to familiarize themselves with all the emergency exits and to think about two separate evacuation routes in the event of an emergency and to recognize that essentially located stairwell elevators may be more crowded

754
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,222
[SPEAKER_17]: and this not be the optimal first choice.

755
01:07:22,022 --> 01:07:29,428
[SPEAKER_17]: We are also requesting that residents notify staff if they have mobility issues that would require the assistance of first responders.

756
01:07:30,009 --> 01:07:43,339
[SPEAKER_17]: It is our intent to maintain a list of residents requesting all requiring special assistance that would be kept inside the fire alarm control panels at each building that would be available to first responders when they arrive at the building.

757
01:07:43,939 --> 01:07:48,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Those lists would be updated whenever individual residents' circumstances dictate.

758
01:07:48,581 --> 01:08:02,027
[SPEAKER_17]: In summary, comprehensive evacuation plans and procedures are being formalized with the input of our residents and will be reviewed with the appropriate public safety and first responders within the Method community.

759
01:08:02,567 --> 01:08:06,949
[SPEAKER_17]: It is also expected that they will be frequently reviewed and updated as necessary.

760
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:13,192
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for recognizing the need for a more formal process than previously followed, signed Joseph McRitchie,

761
01:08:13,645 --> 01:08:16,586
[SPEAKER_17]: interim executive director, and the board of commissioners.

762
01:08:17,146 --> 01:08:42,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I also received a letter from one of the tenants that was just sent out from the Method Housing Authority, and it's an important notice that was sent out to every resident, and it's asking questions on mobility, questions that if residents have special needs, if they have oxygen within the apartment, or any other need that they may have in times of a power outage or an emergency that may take place.

763
01:08:43,643 --> 01:09:06,873
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm happy to say that we offer a lot of resolutions before this council, and I'm pleased to see the quick response from Meffitt Housing on behalf of the 843 residents, or 843 units that house residents in our community that are under the developments, Mr. President.

764
01:09:07,413 --> 01:09:09,193
[SPEAKER_17]: So they did an extensive,

765
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:16,364
[SPEAKER_17]: outreach to the community, which is underway right now, to try to get input.

766
01:09:16,985 --> 01:09:25,531
[SPEAKER_17]: They have discussed this with the local public safety officials, including the fire department and first aid responders.

767
01:09:26,212 --> 01:09:40,863
[SPEAKER_17]: And I feel comfortable now, Mr. President, that this issue is currently being addressed and that, as a result, we'll have a safer environment for our people living in the housing department.

768
01:09:41,268 --> 01:09:42,508
[SPEAKER_17]: housing units throughout the city.

769
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:43,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

770
01:09:44,529 --> 01:09:45,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me, gentleman in the back.

771
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:47,710
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't hear him here.

772
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:48,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

773
01:09:50,131 --> 01:09:50,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Knight.

774
01:09:51,572 --> 01:09:52,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

775
01:09:52,872 --> 01:09:53,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Mox, great work.

776
01:09:53,872 --> 01:09:54,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Great work, Counselor Mox.

777
01:09:55,313 --> 01:09:57,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President.

778
01:09:57,794 --> 01:10:00,735
[SPEAKER_11]: As we know, Mr. McRitchie was the interim director, and he's since gone.

779
01:10:00,795 --> 01:10:07,377
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. Driscoll is now the executive director, Jeffrey Driscoll, Attorney Jeffrey Driscoll, someone who I have had the pleasure of working with in the past, Mr. President.

780
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:12,923
[SPEAKER_11]: He was heavily involved with Mass Narrow during his tenure as an executive director in the housing authority business.

781
01:10:13,143 --> 01:10:22,468
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's most notably renowned for turning around the Taunton Housing Authority, I believe, Mr. President, which was one of the worst housing authorities in the state, mismanaged.

782
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:26,710
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the time, he went in there and he whipped everybody into shape and turned the place around.

783
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:31,072
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I'm very excited to have Mr. Driscoll as part of the team here in the city of Medford.

784
01:10:31,092 --> 01:10:33,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I welcome him aboard, and I wish him the best of luck.

785
01:10:33,493 --> 01:10:37,415
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd also like to extend to him the courtesy of coming before the council and introducing himself sometime.

786
01:10:38,407 --> 01:10:38,827
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

787
01:10:40,729 --> 01:10:48,615
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor... All those in favor?

788
01:10:48,635 --> 01:10:49,576
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

789
01:10:49,596 --> 01:10:53,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

790
01:10:53,759 --> 01:11:05,188
[SPEAKER_19]: 17-431, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Reverend Edward F. Dowdy on his recent passing.

791
01:11:05,968 --> 01:11:08,010
[SPEAKER_19]: Reverend Dowdy was the former pastor

792
01:11:08,338 --> 01:11:08,638
[SPEAKER_19]: of St.

793
01:11:08,678 --> 01:11:09,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Francis and St.

794
01:11:09,859 --> 01:11:11,519
[SPEAKER_19]: Joseph's Church in Medford.

795
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,200
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Falco.

796
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:16,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Caviello.

797
01:11:16,782 --> 01:11:24,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Just probably about a week ago, we lost Pastor Ed Doughty, former pastor of St.

798
01:11:24,285 --> 01:11:25,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Francis and St.

799
01:11:25,185 --> 01:11:25,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Joseph's.

800
01:11:27,206 --> 01:11:29,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Father Ed was pastor for about five years.

801
01:11:30,027 --> 01:11:34,689
[SPEAKER_15]: He's a very nice man, a good friend, former Marine, and he will be missed.

802
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:36,550
[SPEAKER_15]: So thoughts and prayers to his family.

803
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:37,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

804
01:11:38,488 --> 01:11:39,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor DelaRusso.

805
01:11:39,249 --> 01:11:48,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I had the opportunity to work with Father Doughty on a very regular basis in the conduct of my sacred duties.

806
01:11:49,957 --> 01:11:50,437
[SPEAKER_18]: Good man.

807
01:11:50,577 --> 01:11:51,998
[SPEAKER_18]: I studied with him in the seminary.

808
01:11:53,019 --> 01:11:53,980
[SPEAKER_18]: We weren't classmates.

809
01:11:54,020 --> 01:12:00,205
[SPEAKER_18]: He was a couple of years ahead of me, but I knew him back from my theology days in theology graduate school.

810
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:02,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Good man, good family man.

811
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:06,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Father Richard Clancy, another Woburn native,

812
01:12:06,467 --> 01:12:16,729
[SPEAKER_18]: gave a beautiful homily at his Requiem Mass yesterday, which I had the honor of attending with Cardinal O'Malley and other luminaries in the Archdiocese.

813
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:29,711
[SPEAKER_18]: So we wish, as a good priest, he achieved his reward too soon, but yet he achieved that union with the God he served.

814
01:12:30,311 --> 01:12:30,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Very well said.

815
01:12:30,871 --> 01:12:31,411
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be grateful.

816
01:12:31,691 --> 01:12:32,131
[SPEAKER_19]: Very well said.

817
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,452
[SPEAKER_19]: He was an outstanding man.

818
01:12:33,492 --> 01:12:35,752
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we could rise for a moment of silence, please.

819
01:12:51,165 --> 01:12:54,686
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion by Councilor Knight to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

820
01:12:55,706 --> 01:12:57,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Pelly.

821
01:12:57,647 --> 01:12:58,307
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

822
01:12:59,427 --> 01:13:00,287
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

823
01:13:03,028 --> 01:13:04,988
[SPEAKER_19]: My Councilor Del Rosso is being in opposition.

824
01:13:05,909 --> 01:13:19,832
[SPEAKER_19]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council thank Jack McDivitt for his many years of service as a cemetery trustee, and be it further resolved that he be congratulated on his retirement from

825
01:13:20,244 --> 01:13:21,144
[SPEAKER_19]: public service.

826
01:13:21,184 --> 01:13:21,864
[SPEAKER_19]: Counselor Knight.

827
01:13:23,605 --> 01:13:25,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

828
01:13:25,145 --> 01:13:31,687
[SPEAKER_11]: If any of us know Mr. Jack McDevitt, we probably know him from our days as students at Medford High School where he taught for over 30 years.

829
01:13:32,327 --> 01:13:42,169
[SPEAKER_11]: He retired from Medford High School and he actually went on and he became a teacher helping inmates at the Middlesex County House of Corrections receive their GEDs, Mr. President.

830
01:13:42,743 --> 01:13:47,964
[SPEAKER_11]: And after he slowed down at the jail, he moved on to the Board of Cemetery Trustees.

831
01:13:48,665 --> 01:13:54,486
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you take a look at Jack McDevitt's long and storied history in public service, I think you'll also find out that he is a veteran.

832
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:59,267
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's a gentleman that's dedicated more than 50 years of his life to the public.

833
01:13:59,687 --> 01:14:07,069
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to congratulate him for his years of service, thank him for his years of service, and welcome and wish him the best of luck in his years of retirement.

834
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:09,150
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my understanding that the

835
01:14:10,748 --> 01:14:15,932
[SPEAKER_11]: payroll at Frank's Steakhouse got a little larger, and now that Jack's retired and has more time to spend down there, Mr. President.

836
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:16,913
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wish him the best of luck.

837
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:21,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I thank him for his service, and he's a great friend and a great person who's really helped me out a lot in my life.

838
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:22,297
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

839
01:14:23,138 --> 01:14:23,959
[SPEAKER_18]: Counselor DelaRusso.

840
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:36,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Though I didn't have him in school, I didn't go to Medford High School, I know his reputation as a fine teacher and mentor, but I did have an opportunity to work with him in his capacity as a trustee at the cemetery.

841
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:38,711
[SPEAKER_18]: I always found him helpful.

842
01:14:39,552 --> 01:14:45,194
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know he had the best interests of the citizens of Medford at heart at all times.

843
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Del Rosario.

844
01:14:48,095 --> 01:14:48,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor McGovern.

845
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Carviello.

846
01:14:50,696 --> 01:14:52,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to second the paper.

847
01:14:52,156 --> 01:14:54,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. McDevitt is an amazing man.

848
01:14:55,017 --> 01:14:56,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I did have him in school.

849
01:14:56,597 --> 01:14:58,238
[SPEAKER_05]: He taught me my first law class.

850
01:14:58,658 --> 01:15:02,099
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a great, great teacher, one of the reasons I went on to law school.

851
01:15:02,179 --> 01:15:05,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to congratulate him and wish him the best in his retirement.

852
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:06,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

853
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,501
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Mox.

854
01:15:08,396 --> 01:15:09,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

855
01:15:09,917 --> 01:15:11,659
[SPEAKER_17]: And don't think for a minute he's retiring.

856
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:16,462
[SPEAKER_17]: He's been around this city a number of years.

857
01:15:16,522 --> 01:15:19,204
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember him from my days at the high school.

858
01:15:19,905 --> 01:15:24,388
[SPEAKER_17]: And he was always a people person and still remains a people person, Mr. President.

859
01:15:25,049 --> 01:15:32,435
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank him for as many years of dedication to not only the students of this community, but also to the residents of this community.

860
01:15:32,975 --> 01:15:37,979
[SPEAKER_17]: As a very prominent member of the cemetery board, he will sorely be missed.

861
01:15:38,607 --> 01:15:40,067
[SPEAKER_17]: and I hope to see him around the community.

862
01:15:40,527 --> 01:15:40,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

863
01:15:42,388 --> 01:15:43,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

864
01:15:43,508 --> 01:15:44,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

865
01:15:44,788 --> 01:15:48,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I also too would like to congratulate, uh, Mr. McDevitt on his years of service to the city.

866
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:54,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I too had him for a, um, a teacher when I went to Medford high school, a law teacher.

867
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:55,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Great guy.

868
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:56,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, great friend actually.

869
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:57,690
[SPEAKER_15]: And you hit it on the head.

870
01:15:57,770 --> 01:16:02,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Martz, he's just a people, people, person, great people, person.

871
01:16:02,131 --> 01:16:03,731
[SPEAKER_15]: You see him, they still see him today.

872
01:16:03,771 --> 01:16:05,071
[SPEAKER_15]: He walks around all over the place.

873
01:16:05,091 --> 01:16:08,092
[SPEAKER_15]: You see him walking around and he stops and he chats and he says, hello,

874
01:16:08,586 --> 01:16:11,527
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's a great guy, I just want to say congratulations on his years of service.

875
01:16:11,587 --> 01:16:11,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

876
01:16:12,027 --> 01:16:12,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

877
01:16:13,187 --> 01:16:14,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

878
01:16:14,767 --> 01:16:33,351
[SPEAKER_13]: I too echo all of my councilor's words, but if you know Mr. McDevitt in the hallways of Medford High School, that you know he loved his love of BC, and his personality is what really resonated through all students who had him, who didn't have him.

879
01:16:33,431 --> 01:16:37,252
[SPEAKER_13]: So he was a great example of how you give back to our community,

880
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:45,349
[SPEAKER_13]: And like Councilman Mark says, I'm sure he's not done, but we appreciate all the hard work he has done for us.

881
01:16:45,369 --> 01:16:45,889
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

882
01:16:46,931 --> 01:16:48,853
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilman Scott Pelley.

883
01:16:49,113 --> 01:16:52,177
[SPEAKER_19]: And I, too, had him as a teacher, and I see him walking almost every day.

884
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:56,321
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's a nice person to say hello to as he walks by, briskly walking.

885
01:16:56,482 --> 01:16:57,403
[SPEAKER_19]: I should be walking with him.

886
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:20,053
[SPEAKER_19]: Offered by President Caravello and Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Sammy Petrala.

887
01:17:20,673 --> 01:17:28,636
[SPEAKER_19]: Sammy was a Medford businessman for many years in Medford prior to his passing along with being a South Medford icon.

888
01:17:29,809 --> 01:17:39,114
[SPEAKER_19]: His presence in our community will be missed, and Sammy was a good friend to me over many years, and since I was a young child, and again, he will be missed.

889
01:17:43,096 --> 01:17:44,137
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

890
01:17:44,617 --> 01:17:45,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew Castanete.

891
01:17:45,598 --> 01:17:50,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Counselor Caviello, for informing me about Sammy Petrola a couple of hours ago.

892
01:17:51,621 --> 01:17:53,442
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very saddened to hear that he's out.

893
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:11,691
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm at a loss for words, he's a gentleman of a gentleman, one of the kindest people I've ever met in Salt and met Ford, and holy, he left a great legacy, and I hope somebody can even come close to matching him.

894
01:18:12,933 --> 01:18:14,554
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very sorry to his family.

895
01:18:14,574 --> 01:18:14,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

896
01:18:15,415 --> 01:18:16,957
[SPEAKER_19]: If we could rise for a moment of silence, please.

897
01:18:29,552 --> 01:18:43,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Offered by Vice President Moxby, it resolved that the Memphis City Council send a written comment by May 19th in opposition to the proposed cell phone towers located at 63 Tyler Avenue and 59 Charnwood Avenue.

898
01:18:43,814 --> 01:18:50,736
[SPEAKER_19]: The comment should mention that projects 32081 and 32083 in section 10B be sent to Ramacher Contractor for in motion

899
01:18:59,912 --> 01:19:04,034
[SPEAKER_19]: 855 Connolly Drive, Sauk City, Wisconsin, 53583.

900
01:19:05,796 --> 01:19:17,344
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, a copy should be sent to Verona Simon, Executive Director of the Massachusetts Historical Commission, 220 Morrissey Boulevard, Austin, Mass.

901
01:19:18,104 --> 01:19:18,805
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Maxx.

902
01:19:19,925 --> 01:19:21,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

903
01:19:21,206 --> 01:19:26,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Last week I offered this resolution and I want to follow up because I don't believe we voted as a council

904
01:19:26,864 --> 01:19:34,952
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a culminating period that was just as a legal notice in the transcript that appeared April 20th in the Medford transcript.

905
01:19:35,573 --> 01:19:45,503
[SPEAKER_17]: And it asked for comments from residents of this community regarding the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.

906
01:19:47,312 --> 01:20:03,785
[SPEAKER_17]: which states that if a cell tower is posted within or erected within a half mile or proposed to be erected within a half mile of a National Historic Site that comments be allowed.

907
01:20:04,546 --> 01:20:16,415
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's only appropriate that I believe one of the sites is within a half mile of the Royal House.

908
01:20:17,307 --> 01:20:21,849
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other one is very close to being within a half mile of the Brooks Estates, Mr. President.

909
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:37,457
[SPEAKER_17]: So at this time, I would ask that we as a council go on record and submit a letter stating our opposition to both towers, Mr. President, on behalf of this community and on behalf of the historic preservation in our community.

910
01:20:38,015 --> 01:20:38,936
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

911
01:20:38,976 --> 01:20:42,738
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Locks, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

912
01:20:43,299 --> 01:20:43,979
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

913
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,520
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

914
01:20:46,101 --> 01:20:56,028
[SPEAKER_19]: Offered by Councilor Longo Kern, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council thank the Memphis Chamber of Commerce for organizing the successful Clippership Day celebration over the weekend.

915
01:20:56,488 --> 01:21:05,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it further resolved that we thank the Memphis DPW, Memphis Police Department, and the Memphis Fire Department for working and volunteering to help make the day

916
01:21:06,253 --> 01:21:07,814
[SPEAKER_19]: in the event such a success.

917
01:21:08,014 --> 01:21:08,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Council Member O'Kurin.

918
01:21:09,736 --> 01:21:11,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Carviello.

919
01:21:11,857 --> 01:21:15,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to just take the opportunity to thank the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

920
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:30,251
[SPEAKER_05]: They organized over many months Clippership Day, brought it back to Medford Square, the street was blocked off, and a number of vendors were there, a number of businesses took part in the event, and hundreds of families benefited from it.

921
01:21:30,712 --> 01:21:31,632
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little long, 12 to 9,

922
01:21:33,793 --> 01:21:36,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe from 12 to seven, it was jam-packed.

923
01:21:36,595 --> 01:21:43,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there for three or four hours myself, and I know you, Councilor Caravaglia, were there setting up tents and working hard, so thank you as well.

924
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:50,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I also know our Medford Police Department, Medford Fire Department, and our DPW Department were out the whole time.

925
01:21:52,028 --> 01:21:59,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Some details, but a lot of volunteer work as well, and I think that just goes to show what great departments we have.

926
01:22:00,117 --> 01:22:07,201
[SPEAKER_05]: We ask a lot of them, but it is time to thank them for all the hard work they did on that event, and the families thank them as well.

927
01:22:07,641 --> 01:22:08,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

928
01:22:08,402 --> 01:22:17,727
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, Steve Tonelli was there at six o'clock in the morning, and they were there till 10 o'clock at night with the sweepers, and the DPW guys did an outstanding job.

929
01:22:17,787 --> 01:22:22,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Police were there till 10, 11 o'clock at night, and everyone did a, fire department were there all day.

930
01:22:22,869 --> 01:22:23,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone did a great job.

931
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:25,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that they volunteered.

932
01:22:25,811 --> 01:22:26,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Volunteers.

933
01:22:28,182 --> 01:22:32,906
[SPEAKER_05]: DPW are volunteering and I think that just goes to show how dedicated they are to the community.

934
01:22:34,287 --> 01:22:35,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

935
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:47,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Councilor Longo, thank you for bringing this resolution forward and I think I'd also like to take an opportunity to thank the vendors that were there that donated their time and their effort and their energy, especially the amazing John Antarpa and his magic show.

936
01:22:47,617 --> 01:22:48,938
[SPEAKER_11]: From what I understand, it was a big hit.

937
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:50,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I wasn't able to make it.

938
01:22:50,659 --> 01:22:52,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I got down to the clippership days.

939
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,061
[SPEAKER_11]: They were packing up the cars.

940
01:22:54,272 --> 01:23:01,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Allison and the kids and I went down and they were putting the tables in the back of Steve Tanaglia's truck, actually, when we got there.

941
01:23:01,195 --> 01:23:03,815
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was a great day, had by all, from what I understand.

942
01:23:03,836 --> 01:23:06,917
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry I wasn't able to get there sooner to enjoy some of the festivities.

943
01:23:06,977 --> 01:23:10,618
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to thank everybody for their efforts in putting together such a great community event as well.

944
01:23:10,838 --> 01:23:11,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

945
01:23:11,978 --> 01:23:12,719
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli.

946
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:17,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I, too, want to congratulate the team.

947
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:22,422
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that I was a guest at one of the planning meetings.

948
01:23:23,841 --> 01:23:28,223
[SPEAKER_13]: To see the effort of that team bringing back the clippership day.

949
01:23:28,263 --> 01:23:48,133
[SPEAKER_13]: That's been so so so forgotten and Needed and I think these are the days that really bring your community together and I appreciate everything they've done the chamber and and everybody that really pulled forward the the you know, the volunteers the DPW the police but

950
01:23:48,615 --> 01:23:51,196
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, again, John and Topper, unbelievable.

951
01:23:51,676 --> 01:23:59,660
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that Lou would like to see the birds disappear in Medford, so maybe if his son could do some sort of a magic trick, that would be greatly appreciated.

952
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:09,804
[SPEAKER_13]: So just thank you, and again, these are the days, those are the days, even when it was raining and miserable at times, still brought the community out, and I think that's so important.

953
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:12,545
[SPEAKER_13]: So kudos and congratulations on a job well done.

954
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:14,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Felco.

955
01:24:14,447 --> 01:24:15,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

956
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:19,030
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to thank Councilor Longo Kern for bringing this forward tonight.

957
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:22,892
[SPEAKER_15]: I, too, wanted to congratulate everyone involved.

958
01:24:23,353 --> 01:24:24,774
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a successful event.

959
01:24:24,874 --> 01:24:27,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully, it's something that we see or continue to see every year.

960
01:24:28,016 --> 01:24:32,659
[SPEAKER_15]: And especially, thank you to, like my fellow councilors said, the DPW.

961
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:37,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I did get there late, but everyone I talked to said that the DPW came through big time.

962
01:24:38,263 --> 01:24:40,605
[SPEAKER_15]: And they were everywhere, and they helped out with everything.

963
01:24:43,257 --> 01:24:46,298
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, like I said, hopefully this continues into the future, so thank you.

964
01:24:47,138 --> 01:24:57,480
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a little tough in the beginning when the rain, rain was coming down, it stopped, it started, and then, yeah, as soon as it cleared up, it turned into a great day.

965
01:25:00,461 --> 01:25:04,442
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Lococoon, seconded by Councilor De La Rosa, all those in favor?

966
01:25:05,282 --> 01:25:06,242
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

967
01:25:12,058 --> 01:25:28,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the city of Medford is in close proximity to Logan International Airport, whereas the aircraft noise has had a significant negative impact on our quality of life, be it resolved that aircraft noise issue be discussed.

968
01:25:28,767 --> 01:25:29,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Falco.

969
01:25:30,128 --> 01:25:31,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

970
01:25:31,389 --> 01:25:39,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Last night I had the opportunity to attend the aircraft noise in Medford meeting here, right in these council chambers.

971
01:25:40,024 --> 01:25:43,506
[SPEAKER_15]: You were there yourself, and Council Member Kern was there as well.

972
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:46,688
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was actually a great turnout.

973
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,850
[SPEAKER_15]: There was probably about 150 people here.

974
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:58,356
[SPEAKER_15]: And a big thank you to Peter Houck from the Massport CAC and Luke Fraser from Logan CAC.

975
01:25:58,376 --> 01:26:02,479
[SPEAKER_15]: They're both of our volunteers that serve on those boards.

976
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:05,561
[SPEAKER_15]: And they put together a great presentation.

977
01:26:05,621 --> 01:26:08,223
[SPEAKER_15]: It lasted probably about an hour and a half, two hours.

978
01:26:08,942 --> 01:26:14,384
[SPEAKER_15]: And they put together a 33-page presentation, which is, I believe, on the city website.

979
01:26:14,724 --> 01:26:16,805
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would definitely encourage everyone to read it over.

980
01:26:17,765 --> 01:26:23,787
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a great talk about how this is really affecting the quality of life here in our city.

981
01:26:24,407 --> 01:26:31,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Regardless of what neighborhood you live in, it really has had a negative impact on everyone.

982
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:37,132
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's something that they did a great job at describing how things used to be and how

983
01:26:37,972 --> 01:26:44,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Things have basically happened over the years where they've streamlined the routes, and they tend to fly all over Medford, unfortunately.

984
01:26:45,634 --> 01:26:51,035
[SPEAKER_15]: And the interesting thing is, is this is a problem that's really not going to go away.

985
01:26:51,055 --> 01:27:05,278
[SPEAKER_15]: They talked about the modernization of Terminal E, which, just to let people know, there's going to be five additional low-cost carriers will offer 23 new flights a week.

986
01:27:05,907 --> 01:27:08,367
[SPEAKER_15]: mostly from the international terminal.

987
01:27:09,068 --> 01:27:11,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Flights will not leave at peak times at 2, 3, 5, and 8.

988
01:27:11,888 --> 01:27:13,468
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll leave at off-peak times.

989
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:17,309
[SPEAKER_15]: There's going to be bigger airplanes flying in.

990
01:27:17,329 --> 01:27:23,430
[SPEAKER_15]: The A380, which carries a lot more than your regular plane, and it's two decks.

991
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:24,730
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a double-decker airline.

992
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:31,591
[SPEAKER_15]: They talked basically about everything from how the patterns change during the weather and whatnot.

993
01:27:32,052 --> 01:27:33,492
[SPEAKER_15]: But an interesting thing is, in 2015, the airport

994
01:27:35,894 --> 01:27:39,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Terminal E, in particular, served 5.5 million international passengers.

995
01:27:40,415 --> 01:27:44,016
[SPEAKER_15]: And by 2030, that's going to go up by 8 million.

996
01:27:44,036 --> 01:27:45,856
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to go up to 8 million.

997
01:27:46,376 --> 01:27:51,237
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's going to be significant increases here with regard to passengers, but also to planes.

998
01:27:51,857 --> 01:28:04,900
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the big things that they pointed out is that, you know, you take a look at other surrounding communities, and really, we don't, as residents here in this city, we actually do not complain enough to Massport

999
01:28:05,462 --> 01:28:06,162
[SPEAKER_15]: about this issue.

1000
01:28:07,143 --> 01:28:12,764
[SPEAKER_15]: So people really have to start to call, start to log complaints online.

1001
01:28:13,344 --> 01:28:24,208
[SPEAKER_15]: If you'd like to go online, you can go to massport.com slash environment slash environmental reporting slash noise abatement slash noise complaints.

1002
01:28:25,028 --> 01:28:28,729
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can also call the noise complaint line at 617-561-3333.

1003
01:28:34,498 --> 01:28:42,081
[SPEAKER_15]: I would encourage everyone, if you have the opportunity to really log on to the city website, take a look through this presentation.

1004
01:28:42,101 --> 01:28:43,782
[SPEAKER_15]: They did a great job.

1005
01:28:43,862 --> 01:28:45,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, 33 pages.

1006
01:28:45,782 --> 01:28:58,767
[SPEAKER_15]: It's full of all kinds of information about aircraft noise, departures, how the hotline works with regard to complaining, and the best way to actually complain.

1007
01:28:59,388 --> 01:29:02,369
[SPEAKER_15]: So they do have a lot of helpful hints here, but overall,

1008
01:29:03,253 --> 01:29:06,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, thanks to Peter Howick and to Luke Preissner who put this together.

1009
01:29:06,795 --> 01:29:07,655
[SPEAKER_15]: They did a great job.

1010
01:29:07,735 --> 01:29:13,599
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would encourage people to call Massport, especially with the warm-up months coming up.

1011
01:29:14,259 --> 01:29:15,720
[SPEAKER_15]: People like to spend time in the yard.

1012
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,281
[SPEAKER_15]: This is going to be an issue, so people should call.

1013
01:29:18,761 --> 01:29:19,322
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

1014
01:29:19,362 --> 01:29:20,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Palacio.

1015
01:29:20,803 --> 01:29:21,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1016
01:29:21,663 --> 01:29:22,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Langel-Kern.

1017
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:25,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1018
01:29:25,325 --> 01:29:30,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have some notes myself, because I wanted to thank Peter and Luke, who

1019
01:29:30,975 --> 01:29:32,115
[SPEAKER_05]: held the meeting last night.

1020
01:29:32,155 --> 01:29:36,836
[SPEAKER_05]: It was extremely informative, and it's something that we've been in need of for a very long time.

1021
01:29:37,336 --> 01:29:48,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very good to know we have two representatives who do have a seat at the table who are working with regards to MedFed's best interests, and are really educated on the topic.

1022
01:29:49,478 --> 01:29:55,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke gave the first portion of the presentation, and he had graphs, and he educated the public.

1023
01:29:55,779 --> 01:30:00,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that the new radar system that's being used directs

1024
01:30:01,403 --> 01:30:21,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Every flight over Medford that uses 33L versus in the past when you had each pilot deciding on which route they wanted to go on, now with the new radar, every flight with 33L goes over Medford, which I believe it was mentioned last night that it's a direct route over the Andrews Middle School.

1025
01:30:22,091 --> 01:30:24,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is definitely concerning.

1026
01:30:24,373 --> 01:30:26,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's not too little too late.

1027
01:30:26,835 --> 01:30:28,737
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an MIT study going on.

1028
01:30:28,777 --> 01:30:31,399
[SPEAKER_05]: It's halfway done on ways to mitigate the noise.

1029
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:42,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully that second half will, with it grouped in with complaints from Medford, we can get the FAA to make some changes.

1030
01:30:42,549 --> 01:30:47,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And that obviously is the hope and dream, because the noise is a little uncontrollable at times.

1031
01:30:50,118 --> 01:30:56,541
[SPEAKER_05]: main complaints besides speeding that I get as a city councilor, especially in the spring and summer months.

1032
01:30:56,641 --> 01:31:00,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was important for us to be there and get the information.

1033
01:31:01,423 --> 01:31:04,584
[SPEAKER_05]: With regards to the complaints, of 12,685 complaints in 2014, 742 were from Medford.

1034
01:31:04,624 --> 01:31:04,984
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very low.

1035
01:31:05,005 --> 01:31:05,505
[SPEAKER_05]: 2015, that shot down.

1036
01:31:05,525 --> 01:31:06,025
[SPEAKER_05]: 17,695 complaints

1037
01:31:18,017 --> 01:31:20,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Only 508 were from Medford.

1038
01:31:20,498 --> 01:31:27,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we did make a little bit better showing of 1,748 complaints out of 38,000 in 2016.

1039
01:31:28,202 --> 01:31:32,784
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is important because the FAA does look at the number of complaints in a community.

1040
01:31:32,944 --> 01:31:40,628
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't learn about it last night, but I do know from speaking to the representative previously, I believe there was a big issue in Milton.

1041
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:46,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of all their complaints, it's some of the reason why Medford's getting more traffic than we have in the past.

1042
01:31:47,908 --> 01:31:50,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, too, am so happy that we had the meeting.

1043
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:52,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we continue to inform the public.

1044
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:58,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope the public, there had to have been 150 people here and all very concerned.

1045
01:31:59,593 --> 01:32:09,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we can keep spreading the word with regards to getting educated and making the appropriate complaints because I think that is extremely important.

1046
01:32:10,297 --> 01:32:17,400
[SPEAKER_05]: One question that I do have that I didn't know if it came up after the meeting, after I left, I had to go get my daughter a softball.

1047
01:32:18,152 --> 01:32:34,618
[SPEAKER_05]: One concern I have is with regards to, we have all these planes flying over North Medford and our middle schools, the McGlynn and the Andrews, there's studies out there that show the more air pollution from planes causes higher rates of cancer.

1048
01:32:34,678 --> 01:32:46,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, if we could send a request to our, I don't know, Energy and Environment Committee to see if they're involved in this at all with regards to the pollution that's coming from these planes,

1049
01:32:47,498 --> 01:32:55,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that alone, I mean, whether it's flying higher or taking different directions, I think something, noise is obviously the number one complaint.

1050
01:32:55,784 --> 01:33:03,851
[SPEAKER_05]: But people are starting to talk about the pollution that's coming over Medford and getting, I mean, there was a gentleman last night who talked about debris coming from the planes.

1051
01:33:04,251 --> 01:33:05,132
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another concern.

1052
01:33:05,192 --> 01:33:12,797
[SPEAKER_05]: But the pollution, with regards to having young, it's especially for our young children, it's really concerning to me.

1053
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:16,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And it should be a factor, public health and public safety.

1054
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:33,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we could ask if this has been looked into at all, discussed, researched, and maybe we can get our environment committees to, at the table as well, to push, to really push to get these studies, whether it be from MIT or get the administration, thankfully is on top of it.

1055
01:33:33,883 --> 01:33:35,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Burke was here, they're here last night.

1056
01:33:37,326 --> 01:33:40,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Carviel, you and I did try to attend the FAA meeting with her.

1057
01:33:41,629 --> 01:33:43,790
[SPEAKER_05]: We got kicked out, but we did try.

1058
01:33:43,891 --> 01:33:45,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything we can do to,

1059
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:50,473
[SPEAKER_05]: be positive and try to move forward and protect Medford's interests.

1060
01:33:50,533 --> 01:33:51,714
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a little late at the table.

1061
01:33:52,215 --> 01:33:56,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully those two reps are put on and thankfully they're doing a great job.

1062
01:33:56,278 --> 01:34:05,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully we can, I really hope that we can get some resolve to have thousands and thousands of planes coming through Medford.

1063
01:34:05,465 --> 01:34:14,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody hears it from West Medford to South Medford, but especially on North Medford and McGlynn Andrews areas getting hit pretty hard and it's affecting a lot of people.

1064
01:34:15,339 --> 01:34:20,300
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that we can get some mediation resolved from this.

1065
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:21,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1066
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address of the record, please.

1067
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:24,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1068
01:34:24,941 --> 01:34:27,761
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1069
01:34:28,281 --> 01:34:34,182
[SPEAKER_12]: I had opportunity to also attend last night's informational discussion.

1070
01:34:35,222 --> 01:34:43,724
[SPEAKER_12]: And while I am thankful that the meeting took place, I'm not really optimistic from what I learned last night.

1071
01:34:44,194 --> 01:34:52,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, they started the meeting out saying that, uh, present trends of airplane noise are either going to continue or get worse.

1072
01:34:53,556 --> 01:34:57,417
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, I'm led to believe that it's actually going to get worse.

1073
01:34:57,937 --> 01:35:02,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Now as, as, because there's three new airlines, uh, that are going to start.

1074
01:35:04,418 --> 01:35:02,978
11.

1075
01:35:04,438 --> 01:35:05,178
[SPEAKER_12]: 11 new airlines.

1076
01:35:05,258 --> 01:35:13,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of them, uh, double deckers, uh, that'll be coming in over the next, I think you president, uh, Caraviello said last night, one starts next month.

1077
01:35:14,619 --> 01:35:19,301
[SPEAKER_19]: The double-deckers have already started coming here, British Air and Arab Emirates.

1078
01:35:19,621 --> 01:35:21,142
[SPEAKER_19]: They come in with the big A380s.

1079
01:35:21,542 --> 01:35:29,425
[SPEAKER_12]: From what I heard the presenters, excuse me, say last night was, complaints have skyrocketed.

1080
01:35:30,005 --> 01:35:37,748
[SPEAKER_12]: And the information they put out last night was from a study that, I don't think it's half done, Counselor, I think it is done.

1081
01:35:37,788 --> 01:35:39,829
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this slide show,

1082
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:47,111
[SPEAKER_12]: was actually the result of the study that I asked the guy after the meeting.

1083
01:35:47,852 --> 01:35:52,894
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the guy's name from MIT is Professor Hanson or something like that.

1084
01:35:54,015 --> 01:36:04,401
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a taxpayer-funded study that I think more complaints to Massport is good and should happen.

1085
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:09,884
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I really think needs to happen is that we have to address our state

1086
01:36:10,612 --> 01:36:19,336
[SPEAKER_12]: delegation, Congresswoman Clark, Senators Markey and Warren, because these are the people that have the political authority to do something.

1087
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:29,721
[SPEAKER_12]: I looked up, before coming last night, because I thought the airlines were going to be here, the amount of profits that these airlines are reaping.

1088
01:36:29,781 --> 01:36:30,802
[SPEAKER_12]: And I am all for that, 100%.

1089
01:36:31,822 --> 01:36:33,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Make as much money as you can.

1090
01:36:33,463 --> 01:36:35,544
[SPEAKER_12]: But when they're making a combined $29 billion profit,

1091
01:36:37,896 --> 01:36:54,713
[SPEAKER_12]: They can afford to spend a few dollars to fly these planes out over the ocean, make a U-turn, gain the altitude, so they don't have to be subjecting our schools possibly to cancer, so that they don't have to be subjecting our city to

1092
01:36:55,196 --> 01:36:56,257
[SPEAKER_12]: this excessive noise.

1093
01:36:56,557 --> 01:36:58,639
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you heard some of the comments in here last night.

1094
01:36:58,739 --> 01:37:03,724
[SPEAKER_12]: One woman said, if she knew about all this airplane noise, she wouldn't have bought a house in Medford.

1095
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:05,986
[SPEAKER_12]: We want more people to move here.

1096
01:37:06,246 --> 01:37:07,907
[SPEAKER_12]: We want the quality of life to improve.

1097
01:37:08,168 --> 01:37:21,780
[SPEAKER_12]: And as another gentleman said last night, with the CPA surcharge tax, and the property tax, and the water tax, now the connectivity tax, plus the sales tax, two income taxes, where are all these monies going to?

1098
01:37:22,509 --> 01:37:44,202
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're not going to get a better improvement in quality of life, I really think people should direct their complaints and light the fire under our state delegation and our federal representatives to cause a herring, have people come out and hold these airlines accountable.

1099
01:37:44,569 --> 01:37:45,229
[SPEAKER_12]: to what they're doing.

1100
01:37:45,589 --> 01:37:53,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Another option they can do, which is cost prohibitive to the airlines, like they did in East Boston and Winthrop, is start soundproofing the windows in Medford.

1101
01:37:54,093 --> 01:37:55,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Sound panel the houses.

1102
01:37:56,494 --> 01:38:01,596
[SPEAKER_12]: But because it's Medford and also Somerville and Everett, that's cost prohibitive.

1103
01:38:03,176 --> 01:38:12,160
[SPEAKER_12]: The only real solution, I think, here for them to do is to pay the few extra dollars in fuel costs, fly out over the ocean, gain altitude, and then

1104
01:38:13,766 --> 01:38:15,267
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, not subject our cities.

1105
01:38:15,547 --> 01:38:18,369
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, some of these planes are flying at 500 and a thousand feet.

1106
01:38:18,789 --> 01:38:20,330
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's, it's really outrageous.

1107
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:35,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I hope that, that people will still continue to complain to Massport, but if that's only going to fund, uh, cause another taxpayer funded study that tells us what we already know, I mean, what's the point?

1108
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:38,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Get, get the people with the political will,

1109
01:38:38,474 --> 01:38:42,597
[SPEAKER_12]: and authority to do something about this before we start seeing people leave.

1110
01:38:43,038 --> 01:38:45,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want more people to move to Medford.

1111
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,402
[SPEAKER_12]: I want it to be the best city north of Boston.

1112
01:38:48,863 --> 01:38:58,370
[SPEAKER_12]: But it won't be if we continue with these excessive fees, taxes, and planes that are destroying the quality of life in Medford.

1113
01:38:58,671 --> 01:38:59,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1114
01:38:59,251 --> 01:38:59,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1115
01:39:00,392 --> 01:39:01,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Mox.

1116
01:39:02,574 --> 01:39:03,555
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1117
01:39:04,728 --> 01:39:12,093
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I just want to reiterate what I mentioned several months back regarding this particular issue.

1118
01:39:12,913 --> 01:39:30,785
[SPEAKER_17]: We went without a representative on the community advisory committee, which is our direct representative that sits on the committee, which talks about shifting of runways, where runways will filter over, what areas they will filter over.

1119
01:39:31,161 --> 01:39:32,621
[SPEAKER_17]: how it will impact communities.

1120
01:39:33,021 --> 01:39:39,203
[SPEAKER_17]: And for close to two years, we did not have a representative on that committee, a vital committee, Mr. President.

1121
01:39:39,503 --> 01:39:48,065
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was this council that kept on urging the mayor to either appoint someone or put someone on the committee that actually wanted to be there and do the work.

1122
01:39:48,705 --> 01:39:56,927
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree with Councilor Lungo Kern that now we have two great representatives that have appeared before this council on several occasions, Mr. President,

1123
01:39:57,548 --> 01:40:02,912
[SPEAKER_17]: and are doing their homework and their due diligence, and they are attending the meetings.

1124
01:40:04,453 --> 01:40:21,364
[SPEAKER_17]: As to calling Logan Airport and complaining, as Councilor Longo-Kern mentioned, if you look at the statistics, in 2014, out of the 81 communities that reported complaints, Meffitt had the fifth highest number of complaints.

1125
01:40:22,304 --> 01:40:23,785
[SPEAKER_17]: In 2015, out of 84 communities that complained,

1126
01:40:26,572 --> 01:40:36,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Meffitt had the eighth highest in complaints, and then in 2016, out of 77 communities, Meffitt had the fourth highest.

1127
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,942
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how much higher we can get, Mr. President.

1128
01:40:39,823 --> 01:40:51,332
[SPEAKER_17]: The issue is that, honestly, that when you look at other communities that have been involved in years, over the years, they've made headway through their congressional delegation, as was mentioned.

1129
01:40:52,690 --> 01:41:07,933
[SPEAKER_17]: And to be quite frank with you, Congressman Lynch has done yeoman's work for his district to make sure Milton and the other surrounding communities that were faced with a lot of airplane noise had mitigation and were at the table when decisions were being made.

1130
01:41:08,533 --> 01:41:21,256
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not sure that was quite the case with our congressperson, Captain Clark, Mr. President, and I requested several times that we have meetings with our delegation

1131
01:41:22,216 --> 01:41:23,543
[SPEAKER_17]: on the federal side.

1132
01:41:24,385 --> 01:41:35,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, Mr. President, within the community, we have several noise monitors, and this council voted unanimously to take another look at where these monitors are placed.

1133
01:41:36,015 --> 01:41:51,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe they're not in the areas that the jets are coming over, because according to the feedback that I see on Logan Airport website, they're saying that our monitors don't meet the decimal level that requires some type of mitigation.

1134
01:41:52,468 --> 01:41:57,069
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would say that's untrue when you can read the underbelly of a plane and it shakes your house.

1135
01:41:57,489 --> 01:42:01,590
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say that definitely requires some type of mitigation, Mr. President.

1136
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:17,153
[SPEAKER_17]: And you could talk to the residents of Revere, East Boston, Winthrop, and a lot of other surrounding communities that are getting brand new windows, brand new insulation in their roofs, and other factors to help with airplane noise, Mr. President.

1137
01:42:17,633 --> 01:42:18,273
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know,

1138
01:42:19,152 --> 01:42:31,701
[SPEAKER_17]: We can file all the complaints we want, but if we don't have a seat at the table, and if there's no one representing this community, like has been the case in the past several years, then we're just gonna be another bystander as the process goes on.

1139
01:42:32,362 --> 01:42:33,302
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's unfortunate.

1140
01:42:33,943 --> 01:42:38,386
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very pleased to see that we do have these two appointments, Mr. President.

1141
01:42:38,786 --> 01:42:47,733
[SPEAKER_17]: And once again, I would ask that the monitors that are located within the city of Method, because we never got a response on our other one, Mr. President,

1142
01:42:48,387 --> 01:43:03,029
[SPEAKER_17]: that they be reviewed and see if we can find other areas that we can place these monitors that we're experiencing up in the Heights, I agree, in the Wellington area, in South Meffitt area, we're hearing a lot of complaints, Mr. President, the ones I'm receiving, all throughout the community.

1143
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:12,671
[SPEAKER_17]: If we could place them in strategic areas to get some feedback on whether or not residents of this community are eligible for some type of noise mitigation from Massport.

1144
01:43:14,792 --> 01:43:15,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1145
01:43:16,412 --> 01:43:17,452
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

1146
01:43:18,309 --> 01:43:19,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1147
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:20,791
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 281 Park Street.

1148
01:43:21,331 --> 01:43:24,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently reside under the FAA Airline Highway.

1149
01:43:25,314 --> 01:43:31,818
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way for them to reduce the noise complaints was to concentrate the traffic on what they call the Airline Highway.

1150
01:43:32,291 --> 01:43:36,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, if you affect less people, you'll get less complaints.

1151
01:43:37,072 --> 01:43:44,134
[SPEAKER_00]: I've received several letters in response to my complaints that say, we've concentrated the traffic over your area so that it will affect less people.

1152
01:43:44,494 --> 01:43:50,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's great for them and not so great for me, as my tax bill rolls in and it's exactly the same amount.

1153
01:43:51,115 --> 01:43:57,096
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did speak to someone from the soundproofing department at Massport approximately two weeks ago.

1154
01:43:57,196 --> 01:43:59,797
[SPEAKER_00]: I called them and asked them some various questions

1155
01:44:00,978 --> 01:44:04,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone was confused that I spoke to and I ended up speaking to a manager.

1156
01:44:05,004 --> 01:44:13,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I took away from it was one neighborhood can have one very loud plane come in once a week, just one.

1157
01:44:14,573 --> 01:44:18,375
[SPEAKER_00]: In my neighborhood, you can have 40 or 50 planes come in a day.

1158
01:44:18,935 --> 01:44:21,297
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be loud, but not as loud as that one plane.

1159
01:44:21,837 --> 01:44:31,222
[SPEAKER_00]: The neighbor with the one extremely loud plane may qualify for soundproofing, while my neighborhood may not, because they're not doing it cumulatively.

1160
01:44:32,251 --> 01:44:37,594
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an issue because the past two days I think we had over 100 planes.

1161
01:44:37,935 --> 01:44:40,736
[SPEAKER_00]: We had more than 100,000 planes fly over us last year.

1162
01:44:41,097 --> 01:44:45,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Our planes fly in at less than 5,000 feet off the ground.

1163
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:50,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Milton, who got extensive help from state representatives

1164
01:44:51,287 --> 01:44:57,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Their planes fly in at approximately 10,000 square feet, more than double what they're flying over in Medford.

1165
01:44:58,389 --> 01:45:03,571
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have had several feature articles in the Globe about how their neighborhoods are suffering.

1166
01:45:04,091 --> 01:45:13,534
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone saw the two-sentence article that we had in the Globe yesterday, it said, residents get a chance to squawk about airline noise.

1167
01:45:14,315 --> 01:45:15,175
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the headline.

1168
01:45:15,555 --> 01:45:21,157
[SPEAKER_00]: The next two lines were, apparently it's loud in Medford, according to city officials anyway.

1169
01:45:21,989 --> 01:45:24,953
[SPEAKER_00]: come to City Hall at 7 o'clock to hear the meeting.

1170
01:45:25,914 --> 01:45:28,097
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the level of respect that we're getting.

1171
01:45:28,778 --> 01:45:35,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, Elizabeth Warren is our senator, and she is on a committee that studies the FAA noise.

1172
01:45:35,868 --> 01:45:37,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage people to escalate.

1173
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:44,266
[SPEAKER_00]: and go to your state reps, go to your national senator, get some action, because this is getting worse.

1174
01:45:44,686 --> 01:45:49,367
[SPEAKER_00]: But understand that just because it isn't loud in your neighborhood doesn't mean that it isn't loud.

1175
01:45:49,387 --> 01:45:53,028
[SPEAKER_00]: They've intentionally concentrated the noise to reduce the complaints.

1176
01:45:53,908 --> 01:45:55,989
[SPEAKER_00]: People's homes have shaking.

1177
01:45:56,029 --> 01:45:57,489
[SPEAKER_00]: I have things that fall off shelves.

1178
01:45:57,549 --> 01:45:59,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I have soot on the back of my home.

1179
01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:00,290
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not from traffic.

1180
01:46:01,561 --> 01:46:02,962
[SPEAKER_00]: planes flying over my house.

1181
01:46:03,382 --> 01:46:05,643
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter is under treatment in neurology.

1182
01:46:05,703 --> 01:46:06,724
[SPEAKER_00]: She's nine years old.

1183
01:46:06,784 --> 01:46:09,045
[SPEAKER_00]: She's had severe migraines for three years.

1184
01:46:09,465 --> 01:46:12,246
[SPEAKER_00]: She misses more than 20 days of school a year from migraines.

1185
01:46:12,687 --> 01:46:13,507
[SPEAKER_00]: She's being followed.

1186
01:46:13,547 --> 01:46:14,828
[SPEAKER_00]: She's had medication doubled.

1187
01:46:14,888 --> 01:46:16,348
[SPEAKER_00]: She's had medication changed.

1188
01:46:17,429 --> 01:46:25,333
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all connected to sleep interruption from the planes that fly over late at night, that start at 5 in the morning, that don't end until midnight.

1189
01:46:25,713 --> 01:46:27,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in a while, we get a 3 a.m.

1190
01:46:27,074 --> 01:46:27,634
[SPEAKER_00]: flyover.

1191
01:46:28,014 --> 01:46:29,255
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an issue for people.

1192
01:46:30,218 --> 01:46:34,200
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find some way to get soundproofing or just get them to fly higher.

1193
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:39,523
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not believe that the answer is to disperse the traffic and affect more people.

1194
01:46:39,963 --> 01:46:48,448
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the airlines need to consider that there are people under them and that they're affecting us negatively and keep calling and complaining.

1195
01:46:48,488 --> 01:46:57,072
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't stop at just complain to Massport because Massport already knows it's an issue because this is an issue that was intentionally concentrated over specific people.

1196
01:46:57,553 --> 01:46:58,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1197
01:46:58,747 --> 01:47:03,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Massport does have a sound debate program that they use, and you are welcome to call it.

1198
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:06,831
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record.

1199
01:47:09,072 --> 01:47:10,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew, I've been here enough.

1200
01:47:11,593 --> 01:47:26,399
[SPEAKER_16]: At the risk of repeating myself from last night's meeting and being crude, and knowing that hindsight is 20-20, seems to me the local politicians, however, are way too late.

1201
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:27,460
[SPEAKER_16]: They should have been

1202
01:47:28,504 --> 01:47:43,171
[SPEAKER_16]: At that table, if they were, and with better power, back in 2006, 7, before runway 33L was actually built, which affects us on east side of Medford.

1203
01:47:44,472 --> 01:47:51,735
[SPEAKER_16]: But even with Tip O'Neill power, I'm not sure if you're going to stop Massport from doing what they want, being the entity that they are.

1204
01:47:53,136 --> 01:47:55,557
[SPEAKER_16]: And if Logan Airport is way too busy,

1205
01:47:57,279 --> 01:48:03,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Why can't we lay it off, some of that traffic to Providence, Worcester, Manchester?

1206
01:48:06,506 --> 01:48:08,668
[SPEAKER_16]: Seems to me it's a day late and a dollar short.

1207
01:48:09,969 --> 01:48:14,413
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is noise pollution and other pollution, as was stated.

1208
01:48:15,213 --> 01:48:25,762
[SPEAKER_16]: So I say I wish you the best of luck fixing this, or we have to live with it, or it's leaving 02155 if it bothers you that much.

1209
01:48:26,668 --> 01:48:27,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately.

1210
01:48:27,849 --> 01:48:28,229
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1211
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:35,314
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Logan Kern, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1212
01:48:35,955 --> 01:48:36,775
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor.

1213
01:48:36,795 --> 01:48:37,736
[SPEAKER_17]: I have two, Mr. President.

1214
01:48:38,777 --> 01:48:39,057
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry?

1215
01:48:40,218 --> 01:48:42,119
[SPEAKER_19]: As amended by Councilor Marks also, I'm sorry.

1216
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,621
[SPEAKER_19]: What was Councilor Marks' name again?

1217
01:48:45,001 --> 01:48:45,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Noyes Marks.

1218
01:48:46,022 --> 01:48:46,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Noyes Marks.

1219
01:48:50,165 --> 01:48:54,988
[SPEAKER_19]: Offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved that the DPW report back to the Council

1220
01:48:55,525 --> 01:48:58,687
[SPEAKER_19]: on the status of the paving of Paris Street.

1221
01:48:58,787 --> 01:48:59,508
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Nice.

1222
01:49:00,328 --> 01:49:13,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. President, this is just a friendly reminder to our friends at the DPW that they've made a commitment to pave Paris Street this season, and I'm hoping that the DPW and the engineering division can report back to the council with the schedule as to when that will be completed.

1223
01:49:13,758 --> 01:49:17,541
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have requested for Evans Street, and I believe Evans Street goes first.

1224
01:49:17,661 --> 01:49:20,543
[SPEAKER_11]: They're gonna do the water pipe, some underground work, and then they're gonna move over to Paris.

1225
01:49:20,936 --> 01:49:31,263
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just hoping that we can get a copy of the construction schedule so that we can inform our constituencies as to what's going on in the neighborhood, because this has been a long overdue project that needs to take place.

1226
01:49:31,283 --> 01:49:33,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support it and move for approval.

1227
01:49:33,605 --> 01:49:34,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1228
01:49:35,346 --> 01:49:38,908

[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

1232
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:45,173
[SPEAKER_19]: The records were passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

1233
01:49:45,733 --> 01:49:47,714
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scarpelli, how did you find those records?

[SPEAKER_19]: Council combination for May Makibrek.

1242
01:50:05,815 --> 01:50:06,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we gonna do that next week?

1243
01:50:06,956 --> 01:50:08,217
[SPEAKER_19]: We're gonna try to get her here next week.

1244
01:50:08,357 --> 01:50:08,998
[SPEAKER_19]: Next week, okay.
