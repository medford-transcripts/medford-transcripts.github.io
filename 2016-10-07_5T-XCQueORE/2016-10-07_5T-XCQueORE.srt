1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:07,623
[SPEAKER_06]: the financial report, the final summary for the GL for the period of July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016.

2
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:16,590
[SPEAKER_06]: We completed the fiscal year as planned and in the year carrying $100,145 in encumbrances.

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,312
[SPEAKER_06]: These are expenses for which we did not have an invoice at closing.

4
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:23,735
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the expenses are attributable to the FY16 year.

5
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:28,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Utility usage reports are attached, as you can see.

6
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:42,648
[SPEAKER_06]: We did end the year at about 4% over last year in electricity cost, and we did end the year under on the natural gas as we planned by almost 24%, which was indicative of the nice, warm winter we had.

7
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:44,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't guarantee that this year.

8
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:57,129
[SPEAKER_06]: The budget includes a city appropriation of $52,933,000 and 1.7 planned revenue was expended as follows, $52,933,000 general fund expenditures plus 1.5 for planned FY16 general fund expenditures as well as $238,000 offset entry to school revolving accounts.

9
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,250
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll also find attached to your reports the year to year comparison budget versus actuals

10
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions on FY16?

11
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:22,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions?

12
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:24,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have to give any money back to the city?

13
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:25,213
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

14
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I did have one quick question, or one quick note.

15
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:34,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed at the end of the year, the fiscal year 2016,

16
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:43,249
[SPEAKER_07]: that there were three areas in the budget that were more than 10% over their initial budget plan.

17
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:46,830
[SPEAKER_07]: And those areas were the high school, the middle school, and security.

18
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,752
[SPEAKER_07]: My request is that we keep an eye on these for this year and make sure that they stay within their budget parameters.

19
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Through you to the superintendent.

20
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:58,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things you need to remember is that

21
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:10,917
[SPEAKER_01]: In this report, the way it's set up, the distribution of undistributed due to contract negotiations was moved after the fact so that when that gets moved, they're not over the top.

22
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:18,078
[SPEAKER_01]: They just simply reflect that contract negotiations took place and that those contributions went over there.

23
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,939
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just the way it is.

24
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:28,000
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way we report it so you see it in totality in the raw score rather than move the money around and then you just balance it out.

25
00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:30,047
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just show it to you the way it is.

26
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:36,309
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a non-negotiated year, in a year where we're not negotiating a contract, those numbers have already been worked in.

27
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:42,032
[SPEAKER_01]: So you won't see that this year, but you might see it in another negotiated year.

28
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:42,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?

29
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Set the report in place on file, Madam Chairman.

30
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:48,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Those who accept, say aye.

31
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:49,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

32
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:51,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Could I just ask one question?

33
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:51,856
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

34
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,497
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost missed it.

35
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:53,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

36
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Pat, I wanted to thank you for the report.

37
00:02:56,505 --> 00:03:03,008
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to ask just a couple questions for the upcoming school year, you know, in terms of the transportation.

38
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:10,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know last year, um, there was a plan failed trip between, um, the elementary school and the high school.

39
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:15,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I almost missed the opportunity to ask for the funding.

40
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:18,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I wanted to mention it now.

41
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:22,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's a good time, but I wanted to mention that, um,

42
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:24,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I did talk to Ms.

43
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:31,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Lasky, and she was interested in doing another field trip between the elementary school and the vocational school, like the biotech.

44
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:34,392
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to be having another aquaponics.

45
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:46,437
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to mention, I don't know if it's something that I should put on the agenda, because it would be something that we would be doing in the spring, you know, once they're all set with their program.

46
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:51,180
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be more appropriate for the current fiscal year, as opposed to the one

47
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:53,989
[SPEAKER_01]: just passed because that year is over.

48
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:54,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

49
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're looking at, now we'll look at this year's report to date and make a recommendation.

50
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:00,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

51
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:00,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll wait.

52
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:01,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

53
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,612
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'll probably do.

54
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:04,092
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just accept 2016.

55
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:08,273
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor of accepting the report, please sign our file.

56
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:12,474
[SPEAKER_07]: We can move on to the next agenda item, which is the current year 2017.

57
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:19,036
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll start with Mrs. Kreatz's request.

58
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:21,657
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also wanted to mention that,

59
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:29,626
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure that it was extended to all the elementary schools who were, you know, wanted to plan a field trip.

60
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:44,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the ideal grade, you know, seemed to be like the fourth grade or fifth grade level because they could understand and they were, you know, doing the science program very similar to the vocational biotech and biotech and, um, engineering.

61
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:47,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also went for a walk in the fells.

62
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:51,133
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were old enough to understand in the same type of science program.

63
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:54,997
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to make that mention.

64
00:04:55,217 --> 00:05:01,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard from other elementary schools, but I think it was a great, great day, and it was just wonderful.

65
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:05,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it, and I don't wanna forget and miss the opportunity, so I wanted to mention it.

66
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:08,605
[SPEAKER_00]: And, yep.

67
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Superintendent, would you like to?

68
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:13,228
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we take that under advisement and see how we can do it, okay?

69
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:14,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get right back to you.

70
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:15,009
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you.

71
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:20,413
[SPEAKER_07]: A motion on the floor to have the superintendent provide a report to the committee as to whether or not we can

72
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,585
[SPEAKER_07]: um, provide the elementary school children, um, transportation for a trail field trip to our high school building.

73
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:36,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, uh, by Mrs. Kreatz, anyone second by Mr. Scarey motion to approve.

74
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:37,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

75
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:38,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

76
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:38,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

77
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:41,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, motion approved.

78
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:42,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

79
00:05:43,536 --> 00:05:45,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one more question that's different.

80
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, it has to do with the,

81
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,702
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, Pat, you helped answer the question.

82
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:53,584
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with the MBTA, the S-pass.

83
00:05:54,265 --> 00:06:08,997
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know if there was, you know, if, you know, do we previously, you know, provide the middle schools with the S-pass, like the MBTA S-pass for students at the discounted rate?

84
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:15,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I reached out to my niece who was, you know, when she was at Arlington in her middle school,

85
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:18,576
[SPEAKER_00]: she got the discounted student pass.

86
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:21,978
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't know if it was something that we did or we didn't do.

87
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:25,761
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe some people are using it in addition to the high school.

88
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:31,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know we had the parent who was asking if we did provide those passes.

89
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:38,550
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just didn't know where that stood and if it was something that we were going to explore getting those S passes for the students.

90
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,832
[SPEAKER_00]: I did check around with the META.

91
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:45,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is something that would have to go through the school system.

92
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:54,288
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily the MBTA, but it would be something that would be managed between the school system, you know, to, you know, to get those passes.

93
00:06:54,569 --> 00:07:09,140
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't know if it was something that we were going to pursue or maybe do like a survey to find out how many middle school parents would be interested in getting the pass, you know, to see if it was worthwhile to put forward for the next school year.

94
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:11,722
[SPEAKER_07]: We have received emails.

95
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:12,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

96
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:24,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I responded to, um, to both of your, all of your emails, I had several people, uh, we sell between three and 400 bus passes a month for the high school students to transport outside of the heights area.

97
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:29,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, we charge $30 a month for those passes of which we do not see any money.

98
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:30,657
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep nothing.

99
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:32,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It all goes back to MBTA.

100
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:36,660
[SPEAKER_06]: A few years ago, we did do the middle school passes as my understanding.

101
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:39,408
[SPEAKER_06]: We are taking it under consideration.

102
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:41,049
[SPEAKER_06]: The need is very small.

103
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:45,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I've literally had a handful of people ask for them only in the last two weeks.

104
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:49,750
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're looking into whether or not we can do that and what it requires from us.

105
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,971
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have specialized MBTA equipment.

106
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,851
[SPEAKER_06]: We do it all through our own computers and internet.

107
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:59,952
[SPEAKER_06]: So it can be a little cumbersome because we're not using a Charlie card machine.

108
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:05,153
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are looking into it and we should be able to get back to you in the next few days with a decision.

109
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:05,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

110
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:06,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

111
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:20,503
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a motion on the floor placed by Mrs. Kreatz for a report from the superintendent as to a follow-up as to whether we can provide S passes to our middle school and any students attending Method public schools.

112
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:22,004
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor.

113
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:22,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

114
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:24,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had a question about it.

115
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:24,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

116
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:30,336
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question was, I guess I didn't really understand one thing about the yes pass to the kids.

117
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:41,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, can they get the physical pass and loaded at an MBTA station or do they, do we have to, do they have to bring us the money to load?

118
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,743
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but they do have to be tracked and monitored by us.

119
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,224
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they come and check out a card,

120
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:54,437
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they lose the card, we are the person responsible for reactivating a new card and putting a stop on the old card.

121
00:08:54,798 --> 00:09:02,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the card has any money at all left on it, and they come in and say it's lost, then we have to do the actual tracking, stopping, reinitiating.

122
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,064
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a cumbersome task.

123
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,786
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to tell you that our ratio of lost cards is quite high.

124
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:10,848
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the population.

125
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:13,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

126
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:17,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a motion on the board second by Mr. Skerry.

127
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,301
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor say aye.

128
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:19,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

129
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,724
[SPEAKER_07]: All those against motion passes.

130
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:28,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, current fiscal year 2017 report attached.

131
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:35,055
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll find the summary financial report as of September 21 10 month bi-weekly employees have received two checks since August 29th.

132
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:48,007
[SPEAKER_06]: While our 12 month employees have received six paychecks since July one, most hiring has been completed and new employees have finalized paperwork with the requisite Corey check and request for fingerprinting homeless.

133
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:54,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently NPS provides educational programming to 18 homeless students of which nine require transport.

134
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:57,689
[SPEAKER_06]: All students requiring transport have these services in place.

135
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,059
[SPEAKER_06]: online payments.

136
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:06,825
[SPEAKER_06]: The district continues the online payment system, and this year has added the afterschool group to the fax online payment system.

137
00:10:07,526 --> 00:10:12,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Fax provides families with the ease of their annual tuition divided by 10 equal monthly payments.

138
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:17,976
[SPEAKER_06]: E-Community AMCC product handles fee-based programming online payments.

139
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:19,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Special education

140
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:23,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Contracts and purchase orders are in process for all approved programming.

141
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:33,385
[SPEAKER_06]: FY17 budget is initially established as 1.2 million general fund, 1 million idea grant funding, and the balance circuit breaker.

142
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:38,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Additional encumbrance details provided at the close of the first quarter, which is right around the corner.

143
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:42,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Telephones, the VoIP system is established for the district.

144
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:49,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Internal changes due to room moves and name changes are handled internally, and to date, all changes have been completed.

145
00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:52,155
[SPEAKER_06]: transportation.

146
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:55,417
[SPEAKER_06]: MPS utilizes 18 buses running 2 a.m.

147
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,797
[SPEAKER_06]: routes and 2 p.m.

148
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:57,818
[SPEAKER_06]: routes serving St.

149
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Joseph Catholic school, St.

150
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Raphael Catholic school that pick up at 230 stops.

151
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:07,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Roots have been reviewed for use and overcrowding.

152
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:09,365
[SPEAKER_06]: We have made a few adjustments.

153
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:16,129
[SPEAKER_06]: MPS K eight buildings and Eastern bus company are in the process of completing a manual student count.

154
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:23,486
[SPEAKER_06]: That information will be used to update our trans finder system and provide us with the emergency list that we are really looking forward to.

155
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:34,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also like to add that in response to the mayor's earlier report on the updated crossings, we added a stop to the route where the Brooks route goes by a high in Alston.

156
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:38,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've made it so it's all right side pickup along that stretch.

157
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:38,935
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

158
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:44,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Utilities, the initial three months of the FY17 budget year have been uneventful for utilities.

159
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:50,415
[SPEAKER_06]: As in the past, all buildings within the district will be monitored and updates provided on a quarterly basis.

160
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:57,921
[SPEAKER_06]: In closing, the first quarter of the school year is busy with grant closeouts and preparation to complete the state's end of year report.

161
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:06,247
[SPEAKER_06]: FY17 is progressing as expected, and MPS will move forward with continued monitoring of the budget by my colleague, Ms.

162
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:06,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Patterson.

163
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:10,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to thank all of you for the opportunity to serve Medford.

164
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:12,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

165
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:12,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

166
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions?

167
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion of approval.

168
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:16,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

169
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:19,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have one question or one comment.

170
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:25,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Homeless transportation increased $50,000 in our budget for this year.

171
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:28,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It's telling of the times that our families are going through.

172
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:33,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I did speak with Representative Christine Barber about this yesterday.

173
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:44,523
[SPEAKER_07]: There was an amendment in the state budget to set up a committee to track transportation and how we're paying for it as a commonwealth.

174
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am hoping to be placed onto that committee.

175
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:49,829
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't been decided as of yet.

176
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:53,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an increase in costs.

177
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:55,787
[SPEAKER_07]: We have more and more homeless children in our districts.

178
00:12:56,007 --> 00:13:00,348
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know how difficult it is to get rides for all of our children.

179
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:14,631
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to personally thank you for the work that you've done to make sure all our students have a ride to school and all the effort that you've put in, in transportation especially, because I know it's not generally something you would assume is your job.

180
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:20,912
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you for all your years of service and all the tremendous change you made in automating our school district

181
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:33,490
[SPEAKER_07]: and making things more easily understandable, and specifically, personally, teaching me how to read some of these papers and things, so I don't follow the superintendent oh so much.

182
00:13:34,603 --> 00:13:36,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my only- You actually taught her how to read this stuff?

183
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:37,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Pat.

184
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.

185
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:44,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I figured out a few of my questions before I come here.

186
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:49,289
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little less stickies, but that's my only comment on tonight.

187
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:52,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Christine, don't make that mistake again.

188
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you again.

189
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Pat.

190
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Pat.

191
00:13:55,111 --> 00:14:01,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion is on the floor to accept and place the file on, to accept and place the file.

192
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And all in favor?

193
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:03,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

194
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:04,395
[SPEAKER_07]: All against?

195
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:06,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passed.

196
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:10,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Negotiations and legal.

197
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:11,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, I'm jumping.

198
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:18,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Report on 2016 MCAS Park test results and school accountability ratings.

199
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:21,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to call on our deputy superintendent to deliver this report.

200
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:24,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Good or bad?

201
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:27,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot off the presses, okay?

202
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:30,250
[SPEAKER_02]: We just, you don't have these or don't look for these in your package yet.

203
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:48,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think good is the overall word as we start to analyze all of this.

204
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:55,810
[SPEAKER_02]: The information you have we couldn't give to you earlier because actually we just received it Thursday.

205
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,291
[SPEAKER_02]: We had access to our scores.

206
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:06,438
[SPEAKER_02]: on Thursday, and again, we started to analyze things as quickly as we could get things prepared.

207
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:13,483
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this was embargoed until 5 o'clock this afternoon, so this is why we can share it openly with you right now.

208
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:21,168
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first of what we anticipate to be several reports that we are going to give to the committee.

209
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:28,734
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, there are a lot of different layers of analysis dealing with the state testing, so we will, again, present

210
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:39,080
[SPEAKER_02]: what we have in terms of preliminary information in this report that we prepared for you with Carolyn Joy, Nicole Chiesa, and Rocco Sieri.

211
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:55,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, as you probably know, MCAS this past year was administered to just 10th graders in Medford in English and mathematics, and it was the test, the only option for science.

212
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:59,285
[SPEAKER_02]: The science MCAS exam is very different

213
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:01,055
[SPEAKER_02]: than the English and Mathematics.

214
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,696
[SPEAKER_02]: The English and Mathematics MCAS is administered in grade 10.

215
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:14,417
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a test that's a cumulative test of what students have learned through the years up through grade 10, where the science high school test is different.

216
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:22,139
[SPEAKER_02]: The science high school test a youngster takes after they complete a specific science course.

217
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:29,340
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we try to encourage is that our ninth graders, most of whom take introductory physics,

218
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:33,386
[SPEAKER_02]: take the science MCAS introductory physics.

219
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:44,590
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if a student doesn't take that, they can take the biology when they take the biology course, or they can take chemistry when they take the chemistry course.

220
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:50,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So science MCAS is a little bit different, and it's been that way since its inception.

221
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:58,754
[SPEAKER_02]: As you also know, we opted last year, we had a choice for the rest of the school district whether to take MCAS,

222
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:02,682
[SPEAKER_02]: or to take PARCC, and we decided to take PARCC.

223
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:13,584
[SPEAKER_02]: We realized that the new MCAS 2.0 was coming quickly, and that the old MCAS was not gonna resemble that, and the new test was going to be more PARCC-like.

224
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:21,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So we opted in grades three through eight in English and mathematics to have our youngsters be taking the PARCC exam.

225
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:26,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have tonight are really two different reports.

226
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,007
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them deals with accountability.

227
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:35,727
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, school and district accountability, and that, again, was embargoed until this afternoon.

228
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:42,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're happy to report that we have moved up from a level three to a level two.

229
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:52,134
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, last year we had one school that was at level three, and because it takes just one, the entire district was into level three.

230
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:55,315
[SPEAKER_02]: That school has moved out of level three into level two.

231
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,556
[SPEAKER_02]: We're quite happy to report.

232
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,679
[SPEAKER_02]: and the district is now level two.

233
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:02,722
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to be in level one, but again, we'll work towards that this coming year.

234
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:09,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's see, accountability, how do they determine it?

235
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:11,848
[SPEAKER_02]: There are really two factors, and it's very complex.

236
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:17,051
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is obviously student performance on the exams.

237
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:22,155
[SPEAKER_02]: They give scores depending upon how students rate on the exams.

238
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:27,557
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there's a second part of accountability rating, and that is your participation.

239
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:42,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where it gets a little bit tricky, because what they look for is a certain level of participation for the aggregate in the school, that's all the students, and then each subgroup that's reported out.

240
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:49,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year, they report out, they lower the number of students required to report out a subgroup.

241
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:51,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be 40.

242
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:59,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, you would not get a report on, let's say, special education unless you had 40 kids in the school.

243
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:02,947
[SPEAKER_02]: They gradually over the years lowered it, so now it's 20.

244
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:05,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So the threshold for reporting out is now 20.

245
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're getting reports on.

246
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:15,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get more and more subgroups reported out because, you know, more and more kids are making up 20 kids within that group.

247
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:24,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens with participation is that is factored into the whole accountability.

248
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:32,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we basically have done well again with this meeting level two.

249
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to share with you, we just got this just as we left this evening.

250
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:40,823
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to get the comparative accountability ratings of some of the districts.

251
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:46,065
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought we'd like to share that with you because you might be interested in seeing how some of our

252
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:46,885
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors.

253
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:56,733
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

254
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:04,600
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see once you get the sheet that, um, we're actually compared to neighbors doing quite well.

255
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:13,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Arlington, you see most of the accountability ratings are to, uh, Belmont is a one, but you have Arlington,

256
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:28,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Burlington, Lexington, Linfield, Melrose, North Reading, Stoneham, Wakefield, are all level two.

257
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:34,126
[SPEAKER_02]: You will also see that other districts nearby, Somerville's a level three.

258
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:37,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Malden's a level three.

259
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,489
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so those are a little bit lower than we are.

260
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:43,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, many communities that are, you know,

261
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:49,622
[SPEAKER_02]: demographically, um, don't have the challenges that we have are level two.

262
00:20:50,122 --> 00:20:54,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So we feel that we're a pretty good company being able to hold to that level.

263
00:20:57,343 --> 00:21:04,064
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the information, Mr. Skerry films rated for the prospect for receivership.

264
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:07,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Salem actually moved from four to three.

265
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:10,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you have here is 2015 and then 2016.

266
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:11,206
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the movement.

267
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:14,595
[SPEAKER_02]: in communities.

268
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:24,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So Salem actually kind of get itself out from under that four level because they were under scrutiny as a level four, but now they have progressed to level three, right?

269
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:30,418
[SPEAKER_05]: See, the mall hasn't made any changes, but state pumps all kinds of money in there and it's nothing's happened.

270
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:32,118
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that tell you?

271
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:39,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you have, you, you have to work with the students that you have.

272
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that,

273
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:44,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Every teacher in Malden probably works very, very hard with students.

274
00:21:44,868 --> 00:22:02,152
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have ELL students, and I'm going to share with you what happened at the high school because it kind of highlights some of the problems that we have with this whole system, is that, you know, a place like Malden has a lot of ELL students, and those students are required to take the science test.

275
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:03,852
[SPEAKER_02]: They're required to take the math test.

276
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:07,173
[SPEAKER_02]: If they arrive the day before the test is administered,

277
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:12,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, the only opt-out they have is English, and that's only for one year.

278
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really, I mean, is it fair to these students for them to take this test?

279
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:18,844
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

280
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:20,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they required to?

281
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:20,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

282
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:22,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And therein lies the problem.

283
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:30,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what you're seeing in other communities is not that they're not spending their money wisely, or they're not following the curriculum, or their teachers aren't doing their jobs.

284
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:32,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they all are doing that.

285
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: But the students that they're working with, sometimes the rules around who has to take the exam are not fair.

286
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're seeing this.

287
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:44,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to kind of share with you what happened at the high school, because high school is level two and it was level one.

288
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:45,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a concern for us.

289
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:47,666
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's nothing to do with academics.

290
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:52,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as we look at the scores of the MCAS scores, the high school did quite well.

291
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:58,073
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, in many cases, we moved a lot of kids into advanced from actually the lower levels.

292
00:22:59,113 --> 00:23:01,675
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened is the participation rate.

293
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:06,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was only for one subgroup, okay, was the Latin Hispanic subgroup.

294
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:11,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were only 30, what, 32 kids in that subgroup.

295
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:14,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had to do with the science test.

296
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:24,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened is because the smaller the sample you have of students, the more the statistics are going to be skewed by one or two students.

297
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:29,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had three, four students who did not take that test.

298
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:35,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason they didn't take it is because they were ELL students and you can't take the science test

299
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:39,600
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you've taken the rigorous appropriate science course.

300
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:45,423
[SPEAKER_02]: These ELL students, no way could they take introductory physics or biology the first year in this country.

301
00:23:45,944 --> 00:23:54,449
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we designed was a course called general science to give them science, but to build them up slowly so they could take the more rigorous courses.

302
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:57,090
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no general science MCAS.

303
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:03,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Those students couldn't take the test even if they wanted to, okay, because they didn't take the appropriate course.

304
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:05,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened is that we

305
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:19,169
[SPEAKER_02]: To be level one, you have to have participation rate of 95%, which means that we have 32 kids, 30 kids would have had to take that test to get to the participation of 95%.

306
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we didn't have the kids taking the test, and that's what happened.

307
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:30,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't want to have the misconception that the high school academically declined.

308
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:31,091
[SPEAKER_02]: It did not.

309
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:33,872
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually, in many cases, made improvements.

310
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:36,797
[SPEAKER_02]: This participation rate is very tricky.

311
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:40,680
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a subgroup, by the way, that was not reported out to us last year.

312
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a subgroup that tends to contain a lot of ELL students.

313
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:52,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, having no knowledge that this was a problem area, again, we need to pay attention.

314
00:24:52,367 --> 00:25:03,654
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to, as silly as it sounds, if we're going to try to reach for the gold, the level one, we have to put kids in courses

315
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:11,527
[SPEAKER_02]: ELL kids in rigorous science courses, which I don't think is the right thing to do, and if we want them to take the exam.

316
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:12,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, they can't take it.

317
00:25:13,288 --> 00:25:14,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a catch-22.

318
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:18,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a terrible situation that I don't know how we can work around.

319
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:20,192
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about changing accountability.

320
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope they change it in that direction, because it's not fair to those kids.

321
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,616
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might want to know that Boston Latin is level two.

322
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:28,517
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you an idea.

323
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:30,638
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't an academic issue.

324
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:31,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Participation.

325
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:32,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a participation issue.

326
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:40,107
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see it in Andover High School and a lot of other places that you would consider to be immune to this.

327
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:40,807
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not.

328
00:25:41,928 --> 00:25:44,089
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a whole discussion that has to happen.

329
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:49,572
[SPEAKER_01]: You may remember when AYP, annual adequate yearly progress, was the benchmark.

330
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:52,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone was going to be proficient by 2014.

331
00:25:52,774 --> 00:25:58,837
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point around 2012, 80% of the schools couldn't make it.

332
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:00,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had to scratch it.

333
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was an unrealistic target.

334
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:15,962
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're going to set up some of these, these parameters that don't work for certain youngsters, you're going to have difficulty making it on the participation level or on the, you know, achievement level as well.

335
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,283
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what we're facing.

336
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:21,283
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be some discussions at the state level about this.

337
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:25,925
[SPEAKER_01]: The new federal act ESSA gives the states more flexibility.

338
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:26,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what they do with it.

339
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:30,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how, what kind of discussion they have on that level.

340
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:37,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously, if they don't have a discussion, you're going to see the same phenomenon as you saw with AYP.

341
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:40,208
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be more and more districts that drop down.

342
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:43,049
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not going to fly.

343
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:53,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that comes down to, as a district, do you make an ELL kid suffer through a year of coursework that they can't understand at all?

344
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:57,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you put them in a more reasonable course where they can really learn something?

345
00:26:57,257 --> 00:26:58,818
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we run into this problem.

346
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:01,908
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the catch-22 that we're dealing with.

347
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:03,749
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we are level two.

348
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:07,609
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to be level one, but I think we've made progress on that.

349
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you have what our neighbors have done as well.

350
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,450
[SPEAKER_02]: The state assessment.

351
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:23,752
[SPEAKER_02]: The only comparisons we really can make right now would be with the MCAS, because we don't have data from PARC from last year to compare with the results last year.

352
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the directors did is they prepared

353
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:30,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Summaries, they did the highlights of the MCAS for grade 10.

354
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:37,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the science is grade five, eight, and high school, Mr. Cieri did all three grade levels.

355
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:40,774
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of read over the highlights, look at the data.

356
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:42,315
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the data for you.

357
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:46,977
[SPEAKER_02]: The park, because it's so new, we're still in the process of examining it.

358
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:50,880
[SPEAKER_02]: We have numbers, but we're still trying to put some meaning to the numbers.

359
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,623
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you should know is that park is scored very differently.

360
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:58,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Then MCAS, where MCAS has the four categories.

361
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Advanced, Proficient, Needs Improvement, and Warning, or Unsatisfactory.

362
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:10,565
[SPEAKER_02]: The park is judged on a five point scale.

363
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:22,352
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the designations are that somebody has exceeded expectations, met expectations, approximated expectations, partially met, and so on.

364
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:25,194
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very, and we don't quite understand

365
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:27,152
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the meaning behind that.

366
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're looking at next.

367
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:38,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we were told that there's not gonna be a state report in terms of how the students did statewide because some of the students still took MCAS.

368
00:28:38,636 --> 00:28:44,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So to do a comparison with state park results would leave out a lot of districts.

369
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:50,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been told, although I'm not sure that could change, that the state's not gonna give us a comparison figure.

370
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So we may not even be able to say Medford did

371
00:28:53,542 --> 00:29:01,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So much better or so much worse in each category than the state, because we don't have that data right now, and we've been told we're not going to get it.

372
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:02,364
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will be looking at that.

373
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:09,865
[SPEAKER_02]: The student reports, all of them, MCAS and PARCC, will be arriving at our doorsteps in the next couple of days.

374
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:14,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Our plan is to get the results out to parents by the end of the week.

375
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of our plan.

376
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:28,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Have educators and teachers indicated to the Department of Education if the kids are having a problem with science, why can't they take it in their native language?

377
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It might give them a leg up so that they can further progress.

378
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,894
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to have MCAS when it all started.

379
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:39,175
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to have a Spanish version of it.

380
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:40,515
[SPEAKER_02]: They did away with it.

381
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,796
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for English and math.

382
00:29:42,757 --> 00:29:49,360
[SPEAKER_02]: The thinking with ELL is that, you know, these students have to be fully immersed in

383
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:51,558
[SPEAKER_02]: the language as soon as possible.

384
00:29:51,578 --> 00:30:00,663
[SPEAKER_02]: The testing though is, it's just bothersome because it's just like, you know, someone giving us a test in Arabic and we've only been here for, you know.

385
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:06,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I think from the state's point of view it would be advantageous if they know there's a certain test that the kids can't pass.

386
00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:11,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not, you know, make it a little easier for them and then they can pick up speed along the way.

387
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:16,052
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a discussion between the House and the Senate.

388
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:16,492
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both,

389
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:20,529
[SPEAKER_01]: have different viewpoints on the bilingual or ELL laws.

390
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,572
[SPEAKER_01]: The Senate would like to change what the UNS amendment did.

391
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:33,257
[SPEAKER_01]: The House is still moving around on it a little bit, and they haven't been able to reach any kind of consensus.

392
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:36,459
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of ferment around this stuff right now.

393
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:44,364
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I think that becomes obvious to us is that these tests,

394
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:53,732
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, last year they try to use something called the equity percentile to try to find some sort of crossover between MCAS and park.

395
00:30:55,133 --> 00:31:02,019
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it was a very full attempt to try and compare two very different tests and notice the state isn't going to do it this year.

396
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:02,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

397
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:11,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously somebody came to the same conclusion, even though, you know, last year we said to them, we don't think this works.

398
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:13,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um,

399
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:24,061
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they came to the conclusion that since they couldn't really compare all the districts and we think to some degree that impacted our scores last year and impacted our rating last year.

400
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:26,783
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just our thinking about it, but I can't prove it.

401
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:28,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so be it.

402
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Vanderhoof.

403
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:36,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam chair, since the results were just released this afternoon and school committee members have only received the preliminary report.

404
00:31:36,488 --> 00:31:42,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that with the information that was provided so far, um, by, uh, the deputy superintendent,

405
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:54,722
[SPEAKER_03]: that at this point, it seems like it would be appropriate for us to move this to a subcommittee meeting when the rest of the analysis has been done.

406
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:59,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd make a motion to move it to the curriculum subcommittee meeting.

407
00:31:59,623 --> 00:32:00,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion on approval.

408
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:01,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Second by?

409
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:04,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, could I just ask a question before we do that?

410
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:08,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question I was waiting to ask.

411
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:11,686
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to know, because I know the results are coming out this week,

412
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:21,956
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the parents or the students who are 10th graders, who are now juniors, they're going to get their results.

413
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:26,597
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to know if they have to take the retest as soon as possible.

414
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:33,599
[SPEAKER_00]: How quickly is that information going to be made available to those parents and the students?

415
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that there was prep work that was done, MCAS prep that's done.

416
00:32:40,675 --> 00:33:02,267
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the plans for that, and are those students, if they have to take the retest, where the MCAS 2.0 isn't gonna be out till next spring, the students have to take the retest coming up this November, because that's, I don't know the exact date, but it's November, so what are the plans?

417
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:09,831
[SPEAKER_00]: My son's a junior, and this is the big grade we're waiting for, and I know there's a lot of other parents out there

418
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:17,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, a lot of anxiety around that, you know, scoring and, you know, and where is the new test, you know?

419
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:18,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

420
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:27,003
[SPEAKER_02]: The retest, first of all, would be the old MCAS test because the MCAS 2.0 is still in the developmental phases.

421
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:27,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

422
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:28,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not ready.

423
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:32,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're very ambitious to think they're going to have it ready for the spring, but they're telling us they are.

424
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:38,968
[SPEAKER_02]: The results will go home to parents as soon as we get those in tomorrow or the next day is when we've been told.

425
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,062
[SPEAKER_02]: By the state, we'll get the principals to pick them up.

426
00:33:43,842 --> 00:33:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Labels are made.

427
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:46,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to ship them out.

428
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:51,206
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get them on time this week, we're going to ship them out by Friday to everyone.

429
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:53,387
[SPEAKER_02]: So people will know by next week.

430
00:33:54,067 --> 00:34:00,491
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the plans to do the retest, again, this is just the high school level, obviously.

431
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:03,272
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, we don't have our academic support money.

432
00:34:03,412 --> 00:34:04,393
[SPEAKER_02]: They did away with the grant.

433
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:07,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And the academic support grant used to support

434
00:34:07,596 --> 00:34:11,117
[SPEAKER_02]: the MCAS prep, both for the 10th grade test and for the retest.

435
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:25,762
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that Mr. Blau and Dr. Perrella and Dr. Riccio are looking for ways to get those kids, whether we have to put some of the district money into this to get some tutors, we try to get those kids ready for that retest as soon as possible.

436
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:35,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll have a good month to be able to prep, and I know the high school's already trying to be creative in finding ways we can use

437
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:42,005
[SPEAKER_02]: a fine money to make sure these kids, because the MCAS academic support money was really very helpful.

438
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:43,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone.

439
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:47,968
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a concern because that was a great program.

440
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:53,271
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a six week program, you know, for the students who needed help with either math or the English.

441
00:34:53,351 --> 00:35:05,577
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you know, is I'd like to I don't know if I could make a motion that we can make some budget money available for those students, you know, to get the prep and the assistance they need.

442
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,265
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to help them so they can graduate, because this is a big deal and, you know, students need the assistance.

443
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,027
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of them struggle with testing.

444
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:35,141
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the strategies I know, you know, that the students learned was, you know, helpful, and the repetition, you know, and where there was a break over the summer and, you know, things are, you know, getting back into the swing of things, you know, I think it's definitely something that we need to make a priority for the students.

445
00:35:36,315 --> 00:35:49,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I will meet with the high school, as soon as we get the scores in and we see where we stand with the number of kids who have to take the retest, maybe we don't have anybody, maybe they all passed, which would be very nice, but I'll meet with the high school staff next week and we'll work something out.

446
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:56,781
[SPEAKER_02]: There's usually not a huge number of kids, so we'll find something that works because we want them to get diplomas.

447
00:35:59,308 --> 00:35:59,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

448
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:02,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's currently two motions on the floor.

449
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:17,243
[SPEAKER_07]: The first motion is, um, to conduct an academic committee subcommittee meeting, um, where we can go over all testing results, um, from that were recent release curriculum subcommittee curriculum subcommittee side.

450
00:36:18,224 --> 00:36:20,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, both all those in favor.

451
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:20,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

452
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:34,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a second motion by Mrs. Brents for the superintendent to provide us a cost report of implementing a six-week MCAS prep program.

453
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:43,146
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way, as quickly as possible, so we can help all of our high school students.

454
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:47,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, because we'll have to find out.

455
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:53,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Do an assessment and a cost analysis of what you'd need from the school committee to be able to provide that program.

456
00:36:53,705 --> 00:36:56,366
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to that as soon as we get the results.

457
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:57,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

458
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:00,226

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

507
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:30,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

508
00:38:30,804 --> 00:38:31,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot?

509
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:31,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

510
00:38:32,974 --> 00:38:43,261
[SPEAKER_07]: So also on this report, we have a report from the superintendent on the cost involved in attending.

511
00:38:45,243 --> 00:38:46,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Superintendent?

512
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:50,166
[SPEAKER_01]: So we gave you a report on the cost.

513
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:51,668
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually spelled out for you.

514
00:38:51,848 --> 00:39:00,114
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if someone wanted to only go for one or two days, MASC indicated that we could talk to them about it, depending on what their numbers look like.

515
00:39:01,135 --> 00:39:01,555
[SPEAKER_01]: and their costs.

516
00:39:01,855 --> 00:39:03,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would include their hotel stay.

517
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:05,036
[SPEAKER_01]: No, hotels would be different.

518
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:06,177
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a registration cost.

519
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:09,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Hotels or whatever they are.

520
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:10,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally about $100 a night.

521
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:18,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Through you to the superintendent, I just want to say that I'm really happy that both of my colleagues are going to be able to get there for the vote.

522
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:21,943
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an important and very important piece of this conference.

523
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:28,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives us some room at the table, which is nice for our opinions to be seen, to be heard.

524
00:39:29,193 --> 00:39:38,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not going to commit to the whole four days because I am actually working right now on trying to get unpaid leave to get down there, but my cost will be less.

525
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:43,179
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe Paulette's cost will be less because we're both lifetime members.

526
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:47,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will, uh, inform the superintendent of the days that I'll be going.

527
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:49,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions?

528
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:57,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'd like to make a motion at this time that the superintendent report back to the school committee, the total cost of all expenses,

529
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:59,683
[SPEAKER_07]: with attending this conference.

530
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:02,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a second.

531
00:40:03,505 --> 00:40:03,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I second.

532
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:05,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carried.

533
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:06,967
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor, aye?

534
00:40:07,427 --> 00:40:07,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

535
00:40:07,827 --> 00:40:09,228
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

536
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:11,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion accepted.

537
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:14,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Item approved to be placed on file.

538
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:17,272
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

539
00:40:17,552 --> 00:40:18,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

540
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:19,793
[SPEAKER_07]: That's accepted.

541
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:21,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Communication?

542
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:24,355
[SPEAKER_07]: None.

543
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there is one.

544
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to ask Mr. Skerry to read tonight's motion.

545
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:34,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Skerry.

546
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:51,741
[SPEAKER_05]: That the Medford School Committee extend its condolences to the family of Frank Andre, who passed away this week.

547
00:40:52,963 --> 00:40:56,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Frank's daughter, Kara, is a teacher in the special ed department.

548
00:40:56,346 --> 00:40:59,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Frank was very active in civic affairs in the community.

549
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:03,492
[SPEAKER_05]: He had two great passions, horse racing and youth baseball.

550
00:41:03,572 --> 00:41:06,374
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a little league coach in North Medford for many years.

551
00:41:07,695 --> 00:41:16,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Later years, he lived across the street from the park on Fulton Street, and he was a 24-7 watchman and always had plenty of advice for the youngsters.

552
00:41:17,798 --> 00:41:19,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I consider Frank a good friend.

553
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Frank would always call me and let me know what we're doing right here, what we're doing wrong, and how things should change.

554
00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:31,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Frank was also a candidate for this austere body in 1951 when my dad was serving.

555
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:33,429
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll be sorely missed.

556
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:39,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, our condolences go out to the Andre family, and I ask that we observe a moment of silence for Frank.

557
00:41:40,474 --> 00:41:40,975
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

558
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:54,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Condolences to the family.

559
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:55,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

560
00:41:57,228 --> 00:41:59,330
[SPEAKER_07]: That concludes our business for this evening.
