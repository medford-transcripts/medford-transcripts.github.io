1
00:00:01,027 --> 00:00:07,752
So again, this is a continuation of the meeting originally began on March 31st, 2021 at 6 p.m.

2
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:14,776
Continued public hearing for Verizon wireless applications for 43 proposed small cell infrastructures in the city of Medford.

3
00:00:15,637 --> 00:00:24,203
Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12th, 2020 order, suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law, general law chapter 38 and 18.

4
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:31,588
and the governor's subsequent order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place.

5
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:41,495
This meeting of the Medford Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest possible.

6
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:53,943
Specific information and the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with the right and or requirements to attend this meeting can be found on the city of Medford website at www.medford.org.

7
00:00:54,786 --> 00:00:56,907
medfordma.org.

8
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:06,594
For this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by viewing the meeting on cable access or online through Medford Community Media's YouTube channel.

9
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:19,463
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means.

10
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:34,776
In the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media website, an audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting.

11
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,957
The meeting is being held on Zoom.

12
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:40,078
The meeting ID is 933-7697-5064, passcode 035999 for dial-in audio.

13
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:51,623
The number is 1-929-205-6099, ID number 933-7697-5064.

14
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:58,548
All right, I'd like to welcome committee and Verizon and everybody back to continuation of the public hearing.

15
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,612
So the thing I'd like to do is introduce myself and the committee.

16
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:24,373
So my name is Tim McGibbon.

17
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:27,635
I'm the city engineer and the chair of the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee.

18
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:38,540
We also have Paul Moki, who is the building commissioner, Mary Ann O'Connor, who is the director of public health, and Alicia Hunt, director of Office of Community Development.

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,321
So that is the committee.

20
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:42,902
A reminder,

21
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:48,806
We are operating under the interim policy for small cell wireless installation.

22
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:55,488
This interim policy was a result of an FCC declaratory ruling and order.

23
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:57,168
So federal order.

24
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,790
A reminder to everybody that this meeting is being recorded.

25
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:11,132
And I'll just give a summary of the last meeting here.

26
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,041
At the last meeting, we had a presentation.

27
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:15,121
It was made by Verizon.

28
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,862
There was a follow-up period with questions by the committee.

29
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:25,664
The committee introduced the map location as a tool we're using for discussion.

30
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:34,547
That was followed by a substantial non-site specific or general comment period from the public.

31
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:38,488
And many questions were directed to Verizon through that process.

32
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:49,592
We also received a briefing from the city's legal counsel regarding understanding the legal framework, before we got into the specifics of locations and applications.

33
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:56,034
And we voted to grant with conditions application number three, which is at 287 Main Street.

34
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:09,781
And the general conditions that we established the last meeting when that one was under discussion will be listed before we go into the next location on the agenda.

35
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:15,826
Okay.

36
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,931
Before we continue, I'm gonna take some liberties here because I know in the last week,

37
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,202
The buzz has been high regarding this.

38
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:29,684
I just would like to make a statement before we move forward.

39
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,045
It's similar to the statement I made before.

40
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:37,850
That's just to get it off the table and make sure that folks know where I stand as the chair here and how we're moving this forward.

41
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,172
So anyway, here I go.

42
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:45,856
Before we continue, I'd like to make a statement similar to the one I made last week for the benefit of folks who did not hear it.

43
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:49,098
I know there are a lot of folks here who'd like an opportunity to speak.

44
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:52,021
I also know that there are a lot of strong feelings in the room.

45
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,881
I'd like to acknowledge that.

46
00:04:54,381 --> 00:05:00,242
I'd like to make sure folks understand that my job tonight is to go through this agenda, picking up where we left off on March 31st.

47
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:08,404
On the 31st, there was a significant portion of the meeting dedicated to public comment, and we heard quite a lot of opinions and views.

48
00:05:09,164 --> 00:05:12,124
We heard many passionate voices on a variety of topics.

49
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:19,886
As we move into more specific locations, there is a time set aside for site-specific public comment,

50
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:26,435
I'll ask during those periods that folks limit their comments to the specific site that is under discussion.

51
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:33,978
I'd also like to remind folks that this committee has a narrow purview regarding the overall approval process of these systems.

52
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,539
The nationwide approvals of this system take the form of the federal order that I mentioned.

53
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:45,782
The city was under legal obligation to create an interim policy for processing application proposals from companies such as Verizon.

54
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:49,243
The set of application was received after the policy was adopted.

55
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:51,737
All of this took place over a year ago.

56
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:58,684
I personally do not believe wireless antennas should be on wire support utility poles.

57
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:05,272
I am generally a proponent of putting overhead wires underground and removing poles out of the city streetscape in general.

58
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,598
Overhead equipment and wires in the streetscape does not positively contribute to the visual or audible streetscape.

59
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:13,318
It just doesn't.

60
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:21,061
I also do not agree with the idea of the federal government agency telling municipalities what is and isn't good for their community.

61
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:26,064
I also do not agree with the idea that the science and technology is complete.

62
00:06:26,544 --> 00:06:33,227
Today we have radio signals all around us from the wireless service in our homes or offices to the cell phones in our pockets, to the microwave in our kitchen.

63
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:35,886
and the radiation coming at us from outer space.

64
00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:36,806
It's coming from everywhere.

65
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:45,348
To definitively say that we know the long-term impacts on people from serving ourselves with different man-made radio frequencies emissions is laughable.

66
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:48,850
I also personally would not want an antenna outside of my home.

67
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,931
For one thing, more equipment and wires above the street level is not a positive contribution to my neighborhood.

68
00:06:54,371 --> 00:07:03,114
Second, my understanding of the law in Massachusetts is that my local representatives that we the people elect hold the keys to the installation of utility systems in the public ways.

69
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:13,837
With that said, we are reviewing these applications with the best interests, with the interests of Medford residents in mind, not our own personal interests.

70
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:23,927
The circumstances we are presented with are such that denials with this committee would not be in the best interest of the public as it may risk the city losing what little control we do have.

71
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:37,007
As I have done since the beginning, I am recommending that folks contact their federal, state, and local elected officials to make sure they know what your objections are as well.

72
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:39,088
Same thing I've been telling folks that I've been talking to.

73
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:49,876
And a strong reminder here too, it was covered last meeting, but this committee doesn't have any purview over health impacts in general.

74
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:54,760
And I know a lot of comments is about health impacts or about health impacts.

75
00:07:55,335 --> 00:08:00,197
We don't have any purview there, and that's been pretty, it's been explored quite a bit.

76
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:04,379
So like I said, very limited purview.

77
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,021
I'd like to remind everybody the rules of this hearing.

78
00:08:10,202 --> 00:08:22,707
If you have a site-specific comment, please send it in the chat to me or let me know that you'd like to make a site-specific comment, and I will cue you up when the site comes along.

79
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:32,117
You can direct your speech, comments, questions, and things like that directly to the chair, and I can pass them to Verizon.

80
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,161
No profanity in calling, no other rude or disruptive behavior is going to be allowed.

81
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:43,346
The chair may reserve the right to mute participants who become disruptive to the proceedings.

82
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:47,470
And each speaker during the public participation will receive two minutes.

83
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:51,720
General comment period is over.

84
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,804
That was that last meeting, the start of this hearing.

85
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:03,227
So site-specific comments must be relevant to the specific site under consideration.

86
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:09,152
Before we move further, we have Robin on the line.

87
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:18,238
Robin, I was wondering if you could just give an overview of the standard conditions that we established last time.

88
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,920
Sorry, I don't think I have them word for word.

89
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,021
I think they were recorded in the record, but I can give a summary of what they were.

90
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,901
That would be great, thank you.

91
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:41,502
Okay, so let me just run those for you.

92
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:55,025
So generally they were conditions requiring compliance with section F,

93
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:05,812
of the application process, which requires that prior to installation, there'll be the engineering certification as to pole structural safety.

94
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:22,076
And that is in section, it's 1F of the policy, with reference to section 1H of the policy, prior to installation of any units, there'll be, I'm sorry, not 1H, it's,

95
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:26,594
I apologize.

96
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:29,156
I didn't know you were going to put me on the spot like that, Tim.

97
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:29,736
I apologize.

98
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:30,717
That's OK.

99
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:32,538
I'm sorry.

100
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:33,139
Let me go back.

101
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:33,619
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:41,564
It's 2F, which requires certification by a registered professional engineer that the pole or location will safely support the proposed equipment.

103
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:48,829
There was also a condition that prior to installation, there'll be compliance with 2H related to the affidavit of a radio frequency engineer.

104
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,471
Prior to installation, we'll have updated insurance certificates.

105
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,372
There was a condition.

106
00:10:56,005 --> 00:11:03,771
that Verizon will cover the cost of any of the so-called make ready work related to moving or relocating any city lights or infrastructure on any of the poles.

107
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,013
There'll be no installations on double poles.

108
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:15,660
And if a new pole is installed in the future, Verizon will cause removal of the double pole before installing the equipment on the new pole.

109
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:23,065
There'll be a confirmation that all of the poles and installations are ADA compliant.

110
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:32,311
the condition that there be no noise detectable to a human ear at the poll location on the ground and at the nearest residence.

111
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:47,414
There'll be an affidavit submitted consistent with section 2L of the policy, which is that the applicant will certify that the equipment will be maintained in good repair and according to SEC standards, and that it will in fact be kept in good repair.

112
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:53,315
And I believe those are one, two, three, four, five, six.

113
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:58,452
seven, eight, and I had eight conditions from the last meeting.

114
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:12,743
There was one other item I thought it was worth clarifying that it was not voted as a condition, but just that granting the location, the right to be in the public way, but that the applicants still gonna need to apply for any of their local permits or electrical permits.

115
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:21,851
And I don't know if you wanna vote that as a ninth condition, if it needs to be clarified or if you're comfortable based on the applications that that's clear.

116
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,584
But I figured I'd mention it while we were talking about conditions.

117
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,945
I think it's worth clarifying.

118
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:33,087
And there's another condition I would like to bring to the table.

119
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:43,672
Actually two, and one of them actually has to do with the double pole situation.

120
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:51,886
And eventually, should we do this now or should we move to location and do it during a location or?

121
00:12:52,526 --> 00:13:01,552
I think it would make sense to general discussion of them because then you're each motion for the locations, you can just say that you're incorporating the prior conditions.

122
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:02,193
Yeah.

123
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,690
It looks like Verizon has a question, Tim.

124
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,112
Yeah, just a matter of housekeeping.

125
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:21,002
If we have Kathleen Finn as co-host so that if questions come up, we get the right people on, you know, that's all I'm asking.

126
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:21,843
Sure.

127
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:22,783
Okay.

128
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:30,290
Dave, can you be ready in case we need to unmute those people for responses?

129
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:48,651
All right, so committee members, what I wanted to discuss with you about adding to the list of conditions, I did notice that some of the poles don't have the concrete repaired at the base.

130
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:53,212
And also some of the poles seem to be in process.

131
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,953
So they are double poles right now.

132
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:59,694
It looks like new ones were put in and the old ones are still attached to the new one.

133
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:04,439
So one of the things, maybe we can amend the condition about double poles.

134
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:12,283
I also think that the concrete at the base of the poles needs to be repaired as well before the antennas go up.

135
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:17,586
So that's one.

136
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:21,307
Do you have a list of which ones have the concrete issue?

137
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:23,168
I don't have a list.

138
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,769
No, but many of them do.

139
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:34,811
In general, many of them do, whether it's from a double pole installation or it's just never was done or needs to be done.

140
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:44,279
So there's that one.

141
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:48,202
So does anybody else in the committee have anything to say about that?

142
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:50,264
We'll move on it.

143
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:54,327
Paul.

144
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:08,856
Yeah, Tim, is that already one of the requirements in our interim policy that the poles are certified that they are safe for any further installation, or do you feel like something we need to add?

145
00:15:09,797 --> 00:15:21,427
Well, I think the condition should be such that the pole can't be a double pole when they put the antenna on, and it can't be incomplete.

146
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,108
It needs to be completed.

147
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:25,711
So in other words, the concrete needs to be put back where it was.

148
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:28,385
around the base of the pole, basically.

149
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:37,229
So are you talking about existing poles that you're concerned with also, Tim, and there may not be double poles?

150
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:39,470
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

151
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:46,293
I mean, just that's why in general, the concrete should be complete down the bottom, not in disrepair.

152
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,794
It should be in good condition.

153
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,834
Right.

154
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:49,615
Yeah.

155
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:51,095
Well, I agree.

156
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:54,277
We should get some type of report or certification that it's

157
00:15:55,003 --> 00:16:09,014
structurally sound to anchor these poles and any additional height added to the poles by the dis-equivalent on top of the poles isn't going to create any more of a moment type of situation where we may get some unsafe poles.

158
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:14,238
We are, they submitted structural calculations but we've requested those to be certified.

159
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:14,959
Right.

160
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:18,364
by professional structural engineer per the policy.

161
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:31,215
So one of the conditions you've already adopted is that prior to installation of any equipment, you'll receive a certification by a registered professional engineer that the pole under location will safely support the proposed equipment.

162
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:33,697
So that's already a condition.

163
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:49,739
This would just be, I'd like to add, either add a whole new condition or add it to the, I guess it shouldn't be added to the double poles one, but just in general, the concrete should be in good condition at the base of the pole and shouldn't be missing.

164
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,686
When you, Tim, just because I'm not familiar with, when you say the base of the pole, do you mean on the sidewalk itself?

165
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:58,382
Right around the pole.

166
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:05,384
So usually when they take poles out and put them in, there's a square of concrete about two by two, 18 inches by 18 inches.

167
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:12,126
So that's the concrete I'm talking about, the concrete at the base of the utility pole.

168
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:13,647
Okay.

169
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,707
Can I interject for one second?

170
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:29,829
I'd like to direct this to Robin.

171
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:30,930
I've had several calls.

172
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:45,619
from concerned residents stating they wanna know why Medford has decided not to include health effects as a condition for denial.

173
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:58,087
And I am asking you to clarify that this is not a Medford decision, that we have no control over the fact that we cannot include health effects

174
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:15,117
And for those on this call that want to make comments regarding their concerns about health effects, I want them to know before they basically waste their breath, that this is not a decision in our control.

175
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:24,862
And I would like you to make it perfectly clear that this is not a Medford decision, this is not our committee's decision, that our hands are tied on this.

176
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:27,604
No, that's consistent with federal law.

177
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:36,120
Could you please explain to the residents a little bit more clearly that this is?

178
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,181
It's not a decision of the city of Medford.

179
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:48,344
The federal law regulating the installation of personal wireless services facilities prevents you from denying an application based on concerns over health.

180
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,684
I mean, it's that simple.

181
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:50,905
I know folks don't like it.

182
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:55,646
I totally understand, but those are the parameters in which you have to evaluate this.

183
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:04,516
Do I hear any motion for the concrete base?

184
00:19:06,977 --> 00:19:26,142
Can I just ask before you have the actual motion, so would it be, and you may want to get Verizon's input, I don't know, before you move on that, but would it be that to the extent necessary, concrete at the base of the pole shall be installed or repaired to what, is it to your satisfaction as a city engineer, to what?

185
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:28,623
Yeah, to city sidewalk standards, yeah.

186
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:29,809
Okay, that's perfect.

187
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:30,189
Okay.

188
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:37,874
Before we vote on that, I was just looking for clarification in our policies.

189
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:39,836
I apologize they're eight pages long.

190
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:43,278
I sometimes can't remember what's in them.

191
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,965
Do they have a length of time that they have to put that they have in which to put the

192
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:56,609
equipment up after we grant the permit.

193
00:19:57,249 --> 00:20:07,875
I'm just, I was a little, I know we sort of discussed that last week because getting the certified things, getting the right pole in place, getting the other pole removed, getting the concrete on.

194
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:16,604
I don't want us to be in a situation where five years from now, they're installing something that we permitted today, right?

195
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:23,569
I feel like these permits should have a window in which that they're good.

196
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:28,253
Like 10 years from now, they shouldn't be then executing on a permit that we issued tonight.

197
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:36,040
I see there's an annual recertification that's required.

198
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:43,089
And then if it's no longer in use, it has to come down within 30 days.

199
00:20:49,112 --> 00:21:01,298
Because if that's not in here, then I think that we should put some time limit on these permits to do the installation.

200
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:05,845
Yeah.

201
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:09,787
And again, I don't, I'm not, I don't see anything in here about that.

202
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:15,469
Most of it is tied to the annual certifications and removing equipment, which is no longer.

203
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,530
Right.

204
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:31,477
And is there anything that if we didn't put a date that, because it's a permit issued by the city that, you know, they have, I know the conservation commission, which is the board I've been staffing for a long time.

205
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:32,697
You have three years.

206
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:33,578
Yep.

207
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:37,268
So it's not in the policy.

208
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:39,450
Again, that might be something to talk with Verizon about.

209
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:45,473
I don't know what their timeframe is for being able to install 43 or 44 of these.

210
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:51,016
And obviously, I know this is going to take time.

211
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:56,019
I'm just thinking five years, 10 years becomes unreasonable.

212
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,361
Again, I think it's a point to discuss.

213
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:05,630
The other members, I mean, Paul and Tim, you do a lot of more construction work than I do.

214
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:17,159
Well, we have, in building permit-wise, once the permit is issued, there's a six month period they have to start that work.

215
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,965
If it's a special permit, usually by a zoning board, they usually have a year to submit for the permit.

216
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:36,139
The language of the building code, once you start the permit within six months, you have to work as expeditiously as possible to complete it, so they don't really put an end date on it.

217
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:44,222
But the other criteria in the building code is if the work is abandoned for six months, then the permit is revoked.

218
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:48,224
So six months to start is what we go by.

219
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:52,566
Do you have anything, Tim, on your end about your permit?

220
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:54,347
We usually require

221
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:57,366
work to be done within 30 days under a permit.

222
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:01,507
For this situation, I'm not sure.

223
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:09,090
Obviously, the policy is written as if it's abandoned or if it's not being used to take it down.

224
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:16,173
I'm not sure if after a year they haven't installed these, if that means anything.

225
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:19,274
I'm not quite sure about that.

226
00:23:19,854 --> 00:23:24,196
I think as a committee, we could probably condition if we want them to be up within a certain amount of time,

227
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:27,959
I don't know how that would work.

228
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,723
I'd like to hear from Verizon as to what their time frame is.

229
00:23:34,783 --> 00:23:35,403
We can, yeah.

230
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:36,223
We can.

231
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:41,125
I want to ask them about the concrete collars around the bottom of the pole suits.

232
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:44,007
We can ask them about those two things now.

233
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:45,648
Stan, do you have...

234
00:23:46,937 --> 00:23:58,906
Any comments regarding the concrete collar around the base of the pole that I was wishing to condition or the timeframe for implementation after?

235
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:04,250
I think Mike might have both of those, but I can tell you that, you know,

236
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:11,254
placement of concrete or like materials, depending on where they are on the sidewalks.

237
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:16,015
You're not gonna put concrete in an asphalt sidewalk and vice versa.

238
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:24,818
So we would make sure that takes place and that the slab matches and is in conformity with the standards of the city.

239
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:31,820
In terms of timeframe, perhaps Michael or Sean would be best to answer that.

240
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:43,288
Yeah, I think from a practical Sean would be, I don't think there's any justification for making too short a timeframe on these, but Sean may know what the timing plans are.

241
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:46,790
If he's unmuted.

242
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,350
Thank you, Mike.

243
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,110
There you go.

244
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:49,751
Can you guys hear me?

245
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:50,452
Yes.

246
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:52,633
Okay, thank you.

247
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:58,636
Yeah, I mean, as Mike said, I think, I mean, our intention would be to get out and build these sites as quickly as possible.

248
00:24:59,217 --> 00:25:00,277
I would think that a year

249
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:14,020
timeframe on them would be acceptable to us in this occasion with possibly the ability to renew if we're not able to build within that year or you know one renewal for a year maybe.

250
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:22,374
I mean, it seems to me that's reasonable.

251
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:33,502
I'd rather have a deadline and not have these suddenly appearing five years from now and the staff who are then in staff have no idea what's going on, have no history on it.

252
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:34,823
Okay.

253
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:36,804
I mean, I'm open to that.

254
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:37,324
I'm open to that.

255
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:39,586
I mean, 12 months.

256
00:25:42,148 --> 00:25:42,448
Okay.

257
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:45,970
So if there is some locations that require a renewal,

258
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:58,837
How long are we gonna, is that a renewal for an additional year or do we wanna make the renewal for a lesser period of time, like maybe a six month period?

259
00:26:06,602 --> 00:26:11,466
I would ask Robin if that's reasonable and acceptable and allowable.

260
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:20,995
I mean, I think if it works for folks, you could have a condition that any grant of location for which the installation is not complete within one year shall expire.

261
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:30,961
New application shall be required provided, however, that the applicant can apply for up to one year extension.

262
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:35,484
I'd say up to six months.

263
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:40,607
Because if they haven't done it in a year, I mean, they should be able to do it within six months.

264
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:42,148
Yeah, I agree too.

265
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:42,908
Yeah.

266
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:43,209
Yeah.

267
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:46,371
I mean, again, as long as that work, you know, they know what their time schedule is.

268
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:50,755
I think Alicia's point as well, take it needs to be something that makes sense for folks.

269
00:26:51,355 --> 00:26:51,736
Yeah.

270
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:59,282
And they said a year and then a year makes sense based off of the recertification timeframe that we have in policy.

271
00:26:59,342 --> 00:27:05,287
So as far as the annual recertification goes, so it makes sense to have, have it within 12 months.

272
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:10,111
And then if they need to apply for extension, then,

273
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:11,873
They have six months.

274
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:14,935
And that makes a lot of sense.

275
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:19,138
And we're back on the concrete collar.

276
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:26,082
Any objections to those timeframes?

277
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,403
I think that's fine.

278
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:31,385
That should be workable.

279
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:34,247
All right.

280
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,990
So let's vote on, if there's a motion, vote on these.

281
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:42,727
Do you want me to summarize the three of them for you?

282
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,149
If you could, yeah.

283
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:54,014
Actually, before we move to a procedural question, if I present another potential condition here, can we vote on all of them at once, or do we need to do one at a time?

284
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:58,496
No, I think it probably makes sense to just take one vote adding in the additional conditions.

285
00:27:58,796 --> 00:28:00,137
All right, then let's just pause for a moment.

286
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:01,158
Let me read this one.

287
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:01,238
OK.

288
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:12,931
I'm hearing all kinds of information from the public, and I have been thinking of a way to try to address some of this.

289
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:17,374
And this is what I came up with, and I'm speaking to the other committee members here.

290
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:22,699
A letter to homes within 100 feet of any poll location.

291
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:33,167
I know we did the voter notifications 300 feet, but I'm saying for this particular letter, 100 feet, reduce the amount of houses and get the ones that are within 100 feet, explaining what the equipment is,

292
00:28:34,243 --> 00:29:02,940
a list of the FCC standards it complies with and the legal references to those standards, a short description of the federal order, a couple of sentences explaining what the federal order is and what it's doing here, contact information for Verizon Wireless, and a process to follow if the residents would like to request that the antenna be relocated.

293
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:20,767
So that letter would give folks who have these near their houses, who don't want them there, some information to use to try to help them out.

294
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:25,790
This is one of the reasons why I thought conditions is a good idea here.

295
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:29,553
When would folks be getting that letter?

296
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:48,039
We could say, you know, two weeks prior to installation or something like that, or, you know, some timeframe so folks know that it's going up and have the information who to contact, you know, and sort of the framework that gives a little bit of explanation about why it's there.

297
00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:57,806
Tim, you think as far as the delivery net letter, certified mail or regular first class mail,

298
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:02,232
Yeah, certified mail, certified mail for something like this, yeah.

299
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:08,521
And, you know, demonstration to the city that it was done as a condition of the approval.

300
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:13,008
Any of the committee members have any thoughts on that?

301
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:24,652
I wanted us to be very explicit in understanding because everybody got a butters notifications and I believe that was in writing about this.

302
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:28,875
I assume that was a radius that was dictated in here.

303
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:39,224
Are you indicating that same radius or you're talking like the most immediate residential structure?

304
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:41,306
The most immediate residential structure.

305
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:42,507
So within a hundred feet basically.

306
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:52,485
That's a number I'm using because a lot of resident structures are within, you know, sometimes as close as 20 feet, sometimes a couple that are closer.

307
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:56,848
And then, you know, 300 feet was the water notification.

308
00:30:56,868 --> 00:31:05,452
So 100 was just a number I used because there, you know, there's a lot of homes that are 90 feet away, for example.

309
00:31:07,357 --> 00:31:17,299
So it's just the sort of line I drew in the sand to, in my mind, that seems like an appropriate distance as opposed to the full 300 feet.

310
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:22,480
I know the full 300 feet was the notification that folks received for the hearing.

311
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,740
So.

312
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:35,423
I would, if we do this, accept this condition, I would say a month's notification would be,

313
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:56,838
better in that if they do have to reach back out to Verizon and have their reasons for wanting these not to be built in front of their homes or to be moved, I think a month notice is fair to the resident and fair to Verizon.

314
00:31:56,858 --> 00:32:01,241
Any other thoughts from the committee?

315
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:07,304
Yeah, 30 days is, I think, a good time period, Mary Ann.

316
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:11,412
I would think that's a good condition to implement.

317
00:32:14,493 --> 00:32:19,335
Tim, if you could just take a second.

318
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:34,981
When you're part of this condition, a letter of requesting maybe a relocation of the pool, I'm wondering, I don't know if you've thought that through yet, but what kind of time periods would that involve and how do we act on that?

319
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:36,745
I don't know.

320
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:46,571
I mean, I think that it would be a process through Verizon Wireless because we don't have control over where the proposed locations are.

321
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:54,075
We can suggest other locations, but that's, from my understanding, that's about all we can do is suggest other locations.

322
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:59,458
Wait, I'm confused because people can't just request that polls be moved.

323
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:04,839
And this is the process to determine which poll is being used for it.

324
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:13,681
If they have an objection to the poll that's being used, it has to go through the certification policy, the process with this committee, right?

325
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:20,103
I can see wanting to give them notice so that they're aware that there's one going up on their, near their house.

326
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:28,905
I'm not really sure why they fully need, I think a lot of it has to do with different people's opinions on these.

327
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:39,251
Yeah, I was thinking more like the narrows, that we don't have a lot of, like if a person objects because of health reasons, for example, and this committee doesn't have purview on that.

328
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:40,912
So it was more along those matters.

329
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:43,374
Like, is the, you know, what is their process?

330
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:56,062
I mean, I would imagine that there is, as Verizon stated in the last meeting, there is a way to contact Verizon, file complaints, try to get issues remedied.

331
00:33:57,713 --> 00:34:01,476
So I know that there are protocols and procedures that Verizon already has set up for this type of thing.

332
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:06,240
So if the resident has a complaint on the antenna, how do they get that complaint resolved?

333
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:13,947
And if the complaint is that the antenna is there, then the owner of that antenna should be the one responding to that complaint.

334
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:25,317
An interesting thing is that we have in our rules that there can't be any signage, logos, decals on these.

335
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:37,856
which is a little bit perplexing because I would think that we would want it labeled as what company it belongs to so that people have an awareness of whose antenna it is.

336
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:41,400
There are some requirements for that, yeah.

337
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:43,122
Okay.

338
00:34:43,887 --> 00:34:52,711
So they have to post the name, location, identifying information, emergency telephone number, in an area on the cabinet of the small wireless facility that is visible to the public.

339
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:56,993
So that I know, and it's on a specific sign.

340
00:34:57,733 --> 00:35:09,099
My idea was just to sort of have that information sent in a letter, content information, and if there's any complaint with the pole, the location of the antenna.

341
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:13,154
to sort of give some advice.

342
00:35:13,214 --> 00:35:19,295
Sorry.

343
00:35:21,816 --> 00:35:26,597
But anyway, I'd like to move on if folks on the committee.

344
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:28,738
Oh, excuse me, sir.

345
00:35:28,758 --> 00:35:30,058
No, go ahead, please, Robin.

346
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:33,679
I think you should get some input probably from Verizon on that last one.

347
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm not real sure on the wording.

348
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:40,766
Maybe Verizon wants to comment on it first.

349
00:35:42,526 --> 00:35:43,147
Sure.

350
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:49,569
I'm not even sure if the committee is on board with it, but I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to advance it prematurely.

351
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:50,809
That's okay.

352
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:55,731
I just, I do want to move on, but I also want to make sure that the committee understands what I'm trying to do here.

353
00:35:55,751 --> 00:36:05,655
I'm trying to be sensitive to the situation that we're in as a committee, and I'm trying to see if there's an opportunity here to have a condition that gives information to the resident

354
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:16,170
about the poll and who to contact if there are issues and a short description of what it complies with as far as the FCC standards go.

355
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:18,291
That's what I'm trying to get at here.

356
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:25,653
So if no one else in the committee has anything to say, I'll see if Verizon has something to say about it.

357
00:36:31,535 --> 00:36:32,916
Stan, Mike, you guys.

358
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:34,777
Sure, I'm happy to comment.

359
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:43,470
If it's a question of informing people of what the work is that's being done, I don't know that there's an objection to informing.

360
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,912
I think a certified letter is overkill.

361
00:36:45,932 --> 00:36:48,053
This is not a notice situation.

362
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:50,095
You don't need a certification.

363
00:36:50,715 --> 00:36:54,858
This hearing process is really the process to discuss what polls these are on.

364
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:59,682
As one of your committee members just pointed out, I don't think

365
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:18,633
There needs to be a follow on process for this, but in terms of providing contact information and some background information, I think Verizon would be able to do that, even if it was something like a notice that went on the city's website or something too.

366
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:28,819
I mean, you have lots of information out there about this process and we're happy to make reasonable,

367
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:39,052
have a reasonable efforts here, but I don't know that a certified notice to all the people in a certain radius is necessary or reasonable.

368
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:40,792
Thank you.

369
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:44,873
I would like to have some notice called because there is a lot of information out there.

370
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:48,774
But the thing is that we're still getting inundated with comments on this.

371
00:37:50,715 --> 00:37:52,495
So there's a lot of concerns out there.

372
00:37:52,515 --> 00:37:55,456
A lot of it doesn't have much to do about our purview.

373
00:37:57,338 --> 00:38:02,579
but it is out there, so I would like to have something sent out.

374
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:10,441
And I'd like to get the other committee's feeling, committee's member feelings on this so we can move on these, continue to get going here.

375
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:26,484
Well, I think timeframes are essential and I'm not sure, you know, unless we have direct and constant communication with Verizon to post anything on our website, when we will know what's happening.

376
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,302
and in a reasonable timeframe to give residents notice.

377
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:49,634
So I would put the onus back on Verizon to notify, like you said, the about us within 100 feet as to when this is happening and give them an opportunity to give feedback.

378
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:53,877
Yeah, and that's what I wanna try to do here.

379
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:56,018
Can I perhaps make a suggestion?

380
00:38:56,038 --> 00:38:56,839
Yeah.

381
00:38:58,472 --> 00:39:05,794
And to see if that works for Verizon, because I think it will be helpful if we can be on agreement as to the conditions.

382
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:21,519
And perhaps it's just that a week or 10 days, perhaps, written notice before Verizon intends to install will be provided to residents within a specified distance.

383
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:26,140
And the notice can include Verizon's contact information to the extent that there are

384
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:31,688
concerns or problems with the installation in the future and they need to reach somebody.

385
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:35,530
I don't know, Mike, how you feel about that?

386
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,271
You're on mute.

387
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:40,392
Mike, you're on mute.

388
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:56,628
I think that's more consistent with what we have done other places, which is notify an area that there's going to be work done on the poles in their neighborhoods, that there's going to be an installation of what it is, some contact information.

389
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,972
I don't think that would be objectionable.

390
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:18,147
So if you did written notification to residents within 100 feet within 10 days of the anticipated installation, that the installation's coming and provided Verizon's contact information for any problems or concerns, would that work, Tim?

391
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:19,447
Does that avail your concerns?

392
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:24,728
That does work in a sense.

393
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:27,768
I want it to be a little bit more.

394
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:30,149
I liked the idea of a month, 30 days.

395
00:40:32,717 --> 00:40:36,780
to give folks plenty of time to react if they need to?

396
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:45,848
Sorry, 30 days before their installation or 30 days after they received this permit?

397
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:46,968
30 days before installation.

398
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:51,652
Again, I would defer.

399
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,334
I don't know if Mike has a comment on that.

400
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,455
I don't know how this works.

401
00:40:55,475 --> 00:40:57,377
I don't understand what action they take.

402
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:01,808
They're not gonna stop Verizon from changing where it is.

403
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:03,610
They're not gonna stop from the pole.

404
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:16,238
If like suddenly they feel like it's mounted in securely or it starts making noise unnecessarily that it's not supposed to make, that they should know how to contact Verizon, that's great.

405
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,864
But I don't wanna mislead people about what power they're gonna have over this.

406
00:41:26,302 --> 00:41:28,203
Yeah, I don't want to mislead people at all either.

407
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:35,125
If there is an issue with the antenna, they need someone to be able to contact.

408
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:37,806
And I want that to be in a letter that they receive from Verizon.

409
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:47,209
And if they want to try to take further action, to have someone at Verizon they can talk to and name a number.

410
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:54,071
I know it's on the poll itself, but I want folks to have that information.

411
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:19,611
So I'm okay with the way it was 30 days before installation that homes within 100 feet receive a letter explaining what the equipment is, a description of the standards that it complies with.

412
00:42:20,878 --> 00:42:25,522
And contact, these are basically the minimums that I want to see and contact information for Verizon Wireless.

413
00:42:25,823 --> 00:42:39,394
Before I said a short description of the federal order, but I mean, the bare minimum is what I want to see is the list of the standards and a contact person and a short description of why it's there.

414
00:42:42,015 --> 00:42:54,137
And yeah, and, you know, I did say a process to if, you know, they want the intent of relocated, but it's the intent would be more of having a person or a contact at Verizon that they can resolve issues with.

415
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:55,517
That's the idea.

416
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:04,299
So I think from what I, I think Verizon is okay with that.

417
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:09,380
So I want to add that as a condition.

418
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:10,740
So.

419
00:43:11,848 --> 00:43:13,669
So we have four of them now, right, Robin?

420
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:14,710
Yep.

421
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:23,116
So just, I guess the question is, I don't know if anyone Verizon wants to weigh in, you know, I think Mike said certainly written notification to residents within a hundred feet was fine.

422
00:43:23,156 --> 00:43:25,337
Providing Verizon contact information is fine.

423
00:43:26,118 --> 00:43:30,881
Um, is there any issue with just having that have a brief description explaining the equipment that it meets?

424
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:37,285
You know, the physical standards, certainly you folks will have the affidavit, you know, on file at the city.

425
00:43:37,305 --> 00:43:41,288
Um, so I guess the only question, you know, is that something that's reasonable for Verizon to do?

426
00:43:42,324 --> 00:43:43,545
30 days before an installation?

427
00:43:44,806 --> 00:43:44,986
Yep.

428
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:52,069
Oh, if not 30 days, what would be a reasonable timeframe that, you know, three weeks, two weeks?

429
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:57,993
I mean, I think it's all of it's operational for Verizon.

430
00:43:58,013 --> 00:43:59,313
So perhaps they want to comment on that.

431
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:00,254
Yes.

432
00:44:01,254 --> 00:44:02,355
Verizon, Stan, Mike?

433
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:08,958
I think if it said at least 30 days, that would not be a problem.

434
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:09,859
Okay.

435
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:11,440
I'd like to make it 30 days.

436
00:44:17,114 --> 00:44:17,494
Okay.

437
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:17,734
Okay.

438
00:44:17,854 --> 00:44:18,455
All right.

439
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:21,736
Do I hear a motion to, um, improve those as general conditions?

440
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:27,438
I'll make a motion to him to, uh, close those conditions.

441
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:28,439
Okay.

442
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,659
We hear a second.

443
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:31,960
Second.

444
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,561
All right.

445
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:34,702
Do roll call vote.

446
00:44:35,102 --> 00:44:36,622
Um, Alicia hunt.

447
00:44:38,623 --> 00:44:38,863
Yes.

448
00:44:40,364 --> 00:44:40,884
Paul Moki.

449
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:42,325
Yes.

450
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:44,385
Mary Anne O'Connor.

451
00:44:44,405 --> 00:44:51,389
I can't hear Mary.

452
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:52,629
Is Mary Anne present?

453
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:54,350
Yes.

454
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,151
Can you hear me?

455
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:56,451
Yep.

456
00:44:57,592 --> 00:44:59,853
And then me, Tim McGibbon, the chair, yes.

457
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:01,954
Okay.

458
00:45:03,774 --> 00:45:09,657
So we'll have a total of 12 conditions now, the eight from last week and the additional four from now.

459
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:10,758
Okay.

460
00:45:10,798 --> 00:45:13,039
All right, thank you very much.

461
00:45:14,057 --> 00:45:22,424
Certainly, Tim, if members of the public have comments on the specific conditions, as you get to the specific applications, you could always add or vary something.

462
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:23,305
Yeah.

463
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:25,787
Thank you, Robin.

464
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:35,455
All right, so that was the overview of standard conditions as established by the committee on March 31st, 2021.

465
00:45:35,595 --> 00:45:39,859
We're gonna move on to applications in South Medford.

466
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,140
If I could have,

467
00:45:42,346 --> 00:45:47,545
The map brought up and we'll go to 24 Wareham Street, application 36.

468
00:46:14,392 --> 00:46:21,656
And my comments on my review of this one was that it's 55 feet away from two, three-story residential buildings.

469
00:46:22,256 --> 00:46:24,998
I didn't have any additional comments about clearances, et cetera.

470
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:29,320
Anybody on the committee have any comments on this one?

471
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:37,404
Tim, what application number did you say this was?

472
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:39,905
This is application 36, 036.

473
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:40,526
Thank you.

474
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,079
Yeah.

475
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:51,886
And one thing that I added to the information here too, is the utility pole ID is 664.

476
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:55,029
So the metal tag on the pole, 664.

477
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:03,837
And I'll see if there's anyone in the chat about that one.

478
00:47:04,137 --> 00:47:08,461
Tim, just because I think we had asked Dave to help with the,

479
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:15,013
the email information and he's no longer a co-host so can no longer unmute himself.

480
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:19,756
And you are the only one with the power to make somebody a co-host.

481
00:47:20,516 --> 00:47:20,637
Oh.

482
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:23,538
Okay.

483
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:26,300
You don't mind taking a minute?

484
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:28,281
No, what do I need to do?

485
00:47:28,301 --> 00:47:34,045
I need to make the- If you type in the participants list his name, it'll show just that one.

486
00:47:34,065 --> 00:47:38,607
And then under more, you can choose to make him a co-host.

487
00:47:39,408 --> 00:47:39,608
Okay.

488
00:47:42,908 --> 00:47:43,208
All right.

489
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:44,830
He's a co host.

490
00:47:48,995 --> 00:47:59,367
I've been monitoring the chat for people to say if they have specific questions for any address and now Miranda is also on to do that.

491
00:47:59,387 --> 00:48:02,290
We have people who have raised their hands.

492
00:48:03,332 --> 00:48:05,854
during the earlier portion of this.

493
00:48:06,995 --> 00:48:09,336
There are no new hands that have raised.

494
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:11,297
It's just the ones that have been up.

495
00:48:11,477 --> 00:48:13,118
I don't know how we wanna handle that.

496
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:21,224
And there were a number of general comments, the comments that are about a specific address.

497
00:48:21,284 --> 00:48:25,847
I've made a note of the name of that person and the address they were looking for.

498
00:48:26,547 --> 00:48:29,989
All right, do we have anybody for 24 Wareham Street?

499
00:48:30,589 --> 00:48:31,150
Comments on that?

500
00:48:32,023 --> 00:48:33,984
Not that I have seen myself.

501
00:48:34,284 --> 00:48:37,124
Do we have any emails regarding 24 Wareham Street?

502
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,845
There were no emails submitted.

503
00:48:40,725 --> 00:48:41,065
Okay.

504
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:45,146
Do we have a motion?

505
00:48:50,108 --> 00:48:53,508
Just to remind the committee, we can either grant grant with conditions or deny.

506
00:49:00,408 --> 00:49:01,029
That's what we can do.

507
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:05,412
And I would say that, obviously, we have general conditions.

508
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,753
So we would use, apply those.

509
00:49:07,773 --> 00:49:10,535
Do we hear a motion?

510
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:14,719
Tim, a question on the motion?

511
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:15,559
Yeah.

512
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:16,400
We'll make the motion.

513
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:18,361
Grant, what conditions?

514
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:23,045
That would include the four additional conditions we adopted tonight.

515
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:23,705
Is that correct?

516
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:25,867
That is my understanding correct, yeah.

517
00:49:27,705 --> 00:49:32,086
Did I make a motion to approve 24 Wareham Street installation?

518
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:36,207
With or without addition?

519
00:49:36,227 --> 00:49:41,988
Yeah, if the clarity of the record, if we're gonna do the motions, can you do them to grant with the 12 standard conditions voted by the board?

520
00:49:43,468 --> 00:49:45,648
Yes, please, Paul, if you can revise your language.

521
00:49:46,388 --> 00:49:46,588
Okay.

522
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:48,389
Thank you.

523
00:49:48,929 --> 00:49:55,710
Did I make a motion to approve the 24 Wareham Street with the 12 conditions that were adopted by the committee?

524
00:50:00,652 --> 00:50:08,725
Can I like all these hands that are raised we are holding off before.

525
00:50:10,277 --> 00:50:13,738
or if they're not specific to Wayham Street, we're not addressing or?

526
00:50:14,238 --> 00:50:15,679
That's correct, that's correct.

527
00:50:15,899 --> 00:50:22,381
There's a lot to get through and we had a substantial public comment period prior.

528
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:25,042
So we're on site-specific.

529
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:32,684
I'll remind everybody, this is a continuation of last week's hearing and we're going into the site-specific portion of the agenda.

530
00:50:33,504 --> 00:50:37,806
So do we know that all these hands raised are not site-specific?

531
00:50:38,485 --> 00:50:47,451
I will remind everybody, so if you have a site-specific comment, let us know in the chat so we know.

532
00:50:49,092 --> 00:50:54,296
It looks like Councilor Marks is saying thumbs up that he has a site-specific comment.

533
00:50:54,636 --> 00:50:56,498
Is that correct, Councilor Marks?

534
00:50:57,178 --> 00:50:58,979
Yes, he has a thumbs up.

535
00:51:09,482 --> 00:51:16,363
I'm just looking through the chat and make sure that I didn't get any direct messages.

536
00:51:16,384 --> 00:51:20,244
We can unmute Councillor Marks because he said he had a site-specific comment.

537
00:51:20,764 --> 00:51:23,765
Okay, yeah, we can unmute Councillor Marks and site-specific comment.

538
00:51:26,146 --> 00:51:26,926
Hello, Councillor Marks.

539
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:32,207
Thank you very much.

540
00:51:33,944 --> 00:51:41,991
And I just want to start my comment by saying I've never been so disrespected in my 26 years as an elected official in this community.

541
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:57,103
To allow Verizon, an outside company, to speak and not allow an elected official to speak that represents this community for the past 26 years is a complete disgrace, a complete disgrace.

542
00:51:59,637 --> 00:52:07,964
I do have comments to make, and they're site-specific, 43 sites that are on your agenda tonight.

543
00:52:09,205 --> 00:52:13,808
And I totally disagree with the way you're handling public comments tonight.

544
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:16,050
This was a continuation meeting.

545
00:52:16,631 --> 00:52:24,817
Nowhere does it say that additional comments and public input cannot be stated in an additional continuation meeting.

546
00:52:25,157 --> 00:52:28,340
Nowhere in my 26 years as an elected official.

547
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:53,934
If you would, Mr. Chair, I would appreciate the fact, if you would indulge me, because over the past two years, I've received hundreds of emails, phone calls, people stopping me at stop and shop and around the community asking, Mr. President, and as their elected representative, I should have the ability to speak on their behalf.

548
00:52:56,595 --> 00:52:56,976
Thank you.

549
00:52:59,617 --> 00:53:01,939
Comments of April 6th council meeting.

550
00:53:03,415 --> 00:53:06,857
These were my comments and I'd like to read them into the record.

551
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:24,888
And it applies to all 44 applications, not just the 43 that are on tonight, but 44 and any other future applications, which we all know we will see from not only Verizon, but other providers as well.

552
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:32,053
After attending the March 31st Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee public hearing,

553
00:53:32,993 --> 00:53:47,245
I am concerned that corporate greed and commercial benefits of 5G will outweigh the potential long-term health effects of 5G on our residents, home values, and environment.

554
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:56,052
MEFID must delay any wireless build-out until the law and public policy catch up to the science.

555
00:53:57,688 --> 00:54:08,739
The Federal Communication Commission declaratory ruling effectively tied the hands of local municipalities to make decisions best for their community.

556
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:17,207
The city is prohibited from taking any action that is seen as prohibiting Verizon's 5G rollout.

557
00:54:18,411 --> 00:54:35,210
Verizon representatives at one point during the last hearing told Methodist residents unequivocally that the FCC regulations would not allow for health concerns to be discussed as a reason for not approving their applications.

558
00:54:36,371 --> 00:54:39,735
This comment, true or not, is outrageous.

559
00:54:41,418 --> 00:54:49,764
and requires a formal complaint be filed with the FCC and our congressional representatives on behalf of our community.

560
00:54:51,065 --> 00:55:10,200
The city, in my opinion, was ill-prepared for the much-anticipated 5G hearing, not presenting one subject matter expert to represent our city's interest and its residents, and only relied on one-sided Verizon paid expert witnesses

561
00:55:10,918 --> 00:55:12,079
in which there were many.

562
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:26,610
The city has not requested any potential mitigation from Verizon to address further disenfranchisement of the communities in Meffitt who can least afford Verizon's new 5G.

563
00:55:27,531 --> 00:55:39,880
At the very least, Meffitt should request Verizon provide free Wi-Fi to our communities of need, as well as schools, senior housing, and low-income housing.

564
00:55:43,638 --> 00:55:50,865
5G will substantially increase residential exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields.

565
00:55:52,146 --> 00:55:55,870
This has been proven to be harmful to humans and the environment.

566
00:55:56,851 --> 00:56:05,920
We need to engage the US government to require the FCC to do an independent study of radio frequency standards and health risk.

567
00:56:06,768 --> 00:56:32,803
We should support the recommendations of the 400 scientists and medical doctors who signed the 5G appeal that calls for an immediate moratorium on the deployment of 5G and demand our government officials fund the research needed to adopt biologically based exposure limits that protect the health and safety of our residents and the environment.

568
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:47,298
Human exposure guidelines for radio frequency used by the FCC are more than 20 years old and address only thermal, not biological impact of exposure.

569
00:56:48,240 --> 00:57:08,799
Over the past 20 years, a robust body of independent science has emerged showing significant biological impacts from exposure to radio frequency microwave radiation, including clear evidence of cancer, neurological and cognitive harm, heart abnormalities, and reproductive effects.

570
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:22,370
Populations especially at risk include pregnant women, children, the elderly, individuals with implanted medical devices, or cardiac or neurological problems.

571
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:24,791
At the April 6th

572
00:57:26,365 --> 00:57:41,163
This past Tuesday, City Council meeting, I along with Councilor Scott Pelley, co-sponsored docket number 21310, asking the city's 5G small cell interim policy be discussed.

573
00:57:42,344 --> 00:58:04,663
After considerable input and discussion between the council and residents, 10 amendments with six questions were offered, approved, and unanimously voted on by the Memphis City Council 7-0, of which all four members of the small cell committee should have a copy in their hands right now, according to the city clerk.

574
00:58:05,602 --> 00:58:20,297
The vote requested a response from the city solicitor, the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee, the Federal Communications Commission, our federal delegation, the city administration, along with the Biden administration.

575
00:58:21,438 --> 00:58:29,446
The one amendment that requires immediate action prior to any action of this committee tonight is the following.

576
00:58:30,797 --> 00:58:44,233
motion requesting the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee not approve any more 5G applications until the city has ample time to review questions and policy comments submitted.

577
00:58:45,390 --> 00:59:04,542
Be it further requested, the city consult with its own 5G subject matter experts regarding issues of concern raised by residents regarding health and safety, setbacks, FCC 5G regulations, potential mitigation, and other issues of concern.

578
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:14,909
I want to also recognize Council President Caviello, who is on the call, Councilor Scott Pelli, and Councilor Morrell that are also on the call tonight.

579
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:18,981
and all my other colleagues that voted for this this past Tuesday.

580
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:40,313
I respectfully ask that this committee for request the continuation of the meeting originally begun on March 31st to a date certain to allow for additional community comment and input before any vote is taken.

581
00:59:41,674 --> 00:59:43,395
I thank you for allowing me to speak

582
00:59:44,487 --> 00:59:51,151
I thank you for allowing me to represent the 58,000 people in the community that elect me to represent them.

583
00:59:51,251 --> 00:59:51,631
Thank you.

584
00:59:53,252 --> 00:59:55,173
Thank you, Council Member Marks.

585
00:59:55,193 --> 00:59:59,416
I would ask Robin to respond to those, if that's even.

586
01:00:00,665 --> 01:00:01,446
if that's possible.

587
01:00:01,726 --> 01:00:04,227
Could I ask Robin's input for that, please?

588
01:00:04,628 --> 01:00:04,968
Thank you.

589
01:00:04,988 --> 01:00:05,428
Thank you, Mary.

590
01:00:05,448 --> 01:00:09,590
And I would also like to ask Robin to comment on that, but just a couple of things.

591
01:00:10,511 --> 01:00:13,933
So these applications have been pending for over a year.

592
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:20,457
There are shot clocks associated with this and the shot clocks are long run out.

593
01:00:21,477 --> 01:00:29,162
So the risks that I described earlier in my opinions on the matter, I don't disagree with Councilor Marks in a lot of,

594
01:00:30,282 --> 01:00:31,243
A lot of respects.

595
01:00:31,663 --> 01:00:41,631
This goes to the situation that our hands are tied and trying to do- Mr. Chair, with all due respect, with all due respect, we've been in a pandemic for close to 14 months.

596
01:00:42,712 --> 01:00:48,356
There were several meetings held with over a hundred residents that appeared at city hall that were canceled.

597
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:50,638
So I realize there's a shock clock.

598
01:00:50,998 --> 01:00:53,640
I realize Verizon would like to see this happen yesterday.

599
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,905
However, I believe we have to proceed with caution on this matter and there's no rush to judgment.

600
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:03,106
I'm trying to proceed to caution.

601
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:12,291
If they're denied tonight or if it's further, but if it's continued further, we'll well be on the shot clocks.

602
01:01:12,611 --> 01:01:14,952
And I'd like Robin to respond to this.

603
01:01:15,392 --> 01:01:18,614
It's not that simple.

604
01:01:19,814 --> 01:01:25,277
And I'm trying to, I had a substantial period last meeting for public comment.

605
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:33,095
So I would ask Robin to address some of those comments if she can regarding the legal framework of this.

606
01:01:34,716 --> 01:01:37,378
I'm going to be honest, I'm not sure what parts of it.

607
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:45,444
I guess the continuing to delay the process as well as, you know,

608
01:01:50,247 --> 01:01:53,029
health impacts were brought up again and how outrageous that is.

609
01:01:53,069 --> 01:02:19,342
And I agree, but sort of the limited purview of this committee and, you know, the shock clocks maybe are, maybe the shock clocks and what the sort of the, how the delay since they first applied it with the policy and how that leads to where we are today, as far as the shock clocks go and what that

610
01:02:20,178 --> 01:02:21,118
legal framework is?

611
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:31,342
So, I mean, again, the, there are presumptive shot clocks for what is a reasonable time to act on these applications.

612
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:35,443
Um, you are well, well beyond those shot clocks.

613
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:41,185
And certainly I understand that we've been living in, um, you know, limited circumstances and what have you.

614
01:02:41,205 --> 01:02:47,447
I can't say what Verizon will or won't do if you either, um,

615
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:52,796
you know, deny these or continue them in a way where they feel as though they're being denied or prohibited.

616
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:57,538
I can't speak for what Verizon will do, but certainly they will have recourse to the courts.

617
01:02:58,418 --> 01:02:59,998
I've already addressed the health issue.

618
01:03:00,018 --> 01:03:05,960
I don't know what else I guess I can say on this.

619
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,121
You have a policy.

620
01:03:07,141 --> 01:03:11,322
You have applications before you that this policy will lie to.

621
01:03:13,146 --> 01:03:18,970
You know, certainly any changes in aesthetic requirements or not published in advance are not going to apply to these applications.

622
01:03:19,611 --> 01:03:31,320
So, um, it really, it wouldn't change anything for purposes of these applications, in my opinion, if something different, you know, regulating the form of them was enacted tomorrow.

623
01:03:32,897 --> 01:03:41,339
And to the extent that you were to deny any of these applications, you would need to have a substantial reason in your written record based on this policy to do so.

624
01:03:41,899 --> 01:03:44,700
So I understand that folks are in a tough spot here.

625
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,401
I'm not unsympathetic.

626
01:03:46,481 --> 01:03:49,961
I just, I'm sorry, but I don't know what more there is that I can say.

627
01:03:49,981 --> 01:03:51,442
No, you've said it all Robin.

628
01:03:51,482 --> 01:03:52,862
I thank you.

629
01:03:52,922 --> 01:03:55,323
And I addressed some of that myself.

630
01:03:55,343 --> 01:03:58,324
I can't predict the future and I can't speak for Verizon.

631
01:03:58,844 --> 01:03:59,004
Right.

632
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:07,901
I think some of the issues though, Robin, you can speak to is what Councilor Marks brought up about, you know, concerning like going to the FCC and the federal government.

633
01:04:08,441 --> 01:04:11,042
And please give us some more guidance, Robin.

634
01:04:11,062 --> 01:04:13,743
I think you have more to offer us right now.

635
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:18,304
I can't speak to how effective those efforts may or may not be.

636
01:04:18,324 --> 01:04:23,566
And I can't say what Verizon will do should the city put these off.

637
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:27,947
I mean, I think that's a question maybe for Verizon.

638
01:04:27,987 --> 01:04:29,308
I'm sorry, but that's not...

639
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:39,123
You know, again, you have applications before you and you have timelines by which you were supposed to have acted on those applications that you are well beyond.

640
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:42,504
Certainly, Verizon would have recourse to the courts.

641
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:45,326
What do I can't say?

642
01:04:45,366 --> 01:04:50,168
These are tremendously difficult to deny, to defend when it's a denial.

643
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:53,150
I don't know.

644
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:54,030
I'm sorry.

645
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:55,691
I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.

646
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:57,812
I don't know what else to say that I haven't already said.

647
01:04:57,872 --> 01:04:58,752
There are deadlines.

648
01:04:59,473 --> 01:04:59,933
You can't.

649
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:08,534
Well, I mean, I don't think that you can ultimately be successful in just refusing to hear them or refusing to act.

650
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,334
That's my opinion.

651
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:15,015
Mr. Chair, with all due respect, no one's refusing to hear them.

652
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:31,120
We're asking for a continuation so we can have the concerns that are out in the public, which are clear, addressed, and discussed, and don't have people feel that they don't have a say and they don't have the ability to have input with this.

653
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,202
And that's currently how people feel.

654
01:05:33,602 --> 01:05:36,305
And I understand Verizon has their job to do.

655
01:05:36,706 --> 01:05:39,008
But we also as a community have our job to do.

656
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:47,197
And that's all I'm asking is for some additional time, not to kill this, but to allow for more public input, more comment.

657
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:50,220
Clearly, our policy is ineffective.

658
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,441
if we have to put 10 conditions on it.

659
01:05:53,821 --> 01:05:56,863
So it speaks volumes regarding our policy.

660
01:05:57,303 --> 01:06:07,567
And if you look at the council's recommendations the other day, we have a number of recommendations to create a stronger policy that we're requesting.

661
01:06:07,867 --> 01:06:08,968
And I appreciate your time.

662
01:06:09,228 --> 01:06:10,648
I know this is difficult, believe me.

663
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:12,349
This is incredibly difficult.

664
01:06:12,429 --> 01:06:14,270
And I must say that it's been a year.

665
01:06:15,658 --> 01:06:18,600
I mean, it's been over a year, all right?

666
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:27,924
And I would like to just really have everybody acknowledge that it's been over a year, okay?

667
01:06:29,725 --> 01:06:43,792
So I would like to get Verizon's take on even another extension, another extension to allow more time for the community

668
01:06:45,926 --> 01:06:46,847
to discuss this.

669
01:06:46,867 --> 01:06:51,610
Okay, before you ask that question, I have a question for you and the other community members.

670
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:55,573
I did not receive any of those council recommendations today.

671
01:06:55,613 --> 01:06:57,234
Did any other committee members get them?

672
01:06:57,794 --> 01:06:58,615
No, I did not.

673
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:07,981
I was told by the city clerk they would deliver it sometime at around noontime, or maybe shortly after.

674
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:12,124
Well, council, I checked my email in both my

675
01:07:12,848 --> 01:07:14,029
mail in my box today.

676
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:15,990
I didn't get a notification either way.

677
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:20,373
That's why I wanted to make sure the other committee members didn't get them either.

678
01:07:20,914 --> 01:07:21,234
I did.

679
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:22,875
I received, I received them.

680
01:07:23,475 --> 01:07:24,016
I did not.

681
01:07:24,836 --> 01:07:25,917
I did not get them either.

682
01:07:27,998 --> 01:07:31,681
Dave, were those sent to other committee members?

683
01:07:34,023 --> 01:07:40,407
I received the email from the clerk with the unapproved report and I forwarded that over to you, Tim.

684
01:07:41,277 --> 01:07:43,278
I did not forward it to the direct committee.

685
01:07:43,298 --> 01:07:44,238
I sent it to UN Council.

686
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:46,218
Okay.

687
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:48,399
Well, I received it at the end of the day.

688
01:07:48,419 --> 01:07:49,059
I read it.

689
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:51,960
I didn't forward it to the other committee members.

690
01:07:55,161 --> 01:08:03,383
And again, I just want to reiterate that the federal government is prohibiting us from acting on health effects.

691
01:08:04,464 --> 01:08:08,925
And I know that was a lot of what Councilor Marks had to say, but again,

692
01:08:11,725 --> 01:08:12,526
our hands are tied.

693
01:08:15,369 --> 01:08:18,393
So we have, again, a limited purview.

694
01:08:18,893 --> 01:08:26,001
I still believe that robust conditions seem like the best way to go here on these.

695
01:08:27,022 --> 01:08:31,467
I believe if we deny or delay, we're risking

696
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:38,422
them going up as applied for, because the courts rule in Verizon's favor.

697
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:41,283
So I'm trying to maintain a little control we have here.

698
01:08:41,883 --> 01:08:46,965
So I would like to get Verizon's input on an additional time.

699
01:08:48,265 --> 01:08:51,026
How much, you know, are we talking one more month?

700
01:08:53,889 --> 01:08:55,070
Tim, if I could.

701
01:08:55,671 --> 01:08:56,451
Yes, please, Dan.

702
01:08:57,072 --> 01:09:17,830
Yeah, I think that, you know, the amount of public information that we've exchanged over the course of more than a year, as you pointed out, and when you juxtapose what we've done in Medford to any other community, it's been an extraordinary effort to do outreach.

703
01:09:18,385 --> 01:09:20,667
We've done a community meeting.

704
01:09:21,047 --> 01:09:25,731
We've established a website where there can be exchange of information.

705
01:09:26,532 --> 01:09:38,662
And we participated in a public hearing as you have shared just last week and listened quite carefully to the comments that were made.

706
01:09:40,183 --> 01:09:42,845
There is no benefit from continuing this meeting.

707
01:09:43,556 --> 01:09:50,203
beyond the timeframe and to take up the issues that are in front of the committee at this point.

708
01:09:52,165 --> 01:09:53,046
Benefit to who?

709
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:56,190
To all concerned.

710
01:09:57,411 --> 01:09:58,392
I would disagree with that.

711
01:09:59,213 --> 01:09:59,473
Okay.

712
01:09:59,493 --> 01:09:59,994
All right.

713
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:00,935
We have to move on.

714
01:10:00,955 --> 01:10:01,575
I don't

715
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:12,250
With that said, if we continue this further, I don't think that is in the best interest of the city.

716
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,571
I just don't.

717
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:14,611
I live in the city.

718
01:10:14,691 --> 01:10:15,992
It is not in the best interest.

719
01:10:16,032 --> 01:10:23,738
I think in the best interest is to condition these, condition the applications to the best of our ability.

720
01:10:24,218 --> 01:10:26,199
So with that said, I'm going to move on.

721
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:28,801
I have to move on.

722
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:32,464
There's a lot of applications to get to, okay?

723
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:47,927
So we had a, again, I didn't see any site-specific, additional site-specific come in for 24 Wareham Street.

724
01:10:48,628 --> 01:10:54,189
And we have a motion for, Paul, was it a grant with conditions?

725
01:10:56,389 --> 01:10:57,049
Yes, it was.

726
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:59,030
Do we have a second?

727
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:04,851
I'll second it.

728
01:11:06,523 --> 01:11:10,406
All right, we'll take a, that's Alicia Hunt, second.

729
01:11:12,848 --> 01:11:15,510
So let's see, Alicia Hunt?

730
01:11:16,631 --> 01:11:16,891
Yes.

731
01:11:17,892 --> 01:11:18,633
Marianne O'Connor?

732
01:11:25,678 --> 01:11:26,319
Marianne O'Connor?

733
01:11:31,383 --> 01:11:31,643
Yes.

734
01:11:32,964 --> 01:11:33,444
Paul Mulkey?

735
01:11:34,726 --> 01:11:34,966
Yes.

736
01:11:36,816 --> 01:11:38,737
And I am a yes as well with the conditions.

737
01:11:41,678 --> 01:11:45,099
13 Higgins Avenue, application 41, poll ID 587.

738
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:47,460
If you could bring that up on the map, please.

739
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:47,720
All right.

740
01:12:12,342 --> 01:12:22,826
So the points from my review, there's a three-story residential building within about 13 feet.

741
01:12:22,866 --> 01:12:23,726
I think you can see that.

742
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:30,868
Other buildings located within 60 feet, dense residential area with many three-story buildings.

743
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:37,170
Now, Dave, do we have any emails regarding 13 Higgins Avenue?

744
01:12:43,065 --> 01:12:45,746
Okay, I'm gonna check the chat to see if we have anything.

745
01:12:55,069 --> 01:13:09,395
Miranda and I have been watching the chat for people to say if it's about a specific location or something that we are being, some people want us to recognize them, but they haven't indicated what it is they wanna talk about, what their topic is.

746
01:13:17,672 --> 01:13:17,932
Tim?

747
01:13:19,073 --> 01:13:22,075
Hold on, I'm trying to complete the task that I said.

748
01:13:25,938 --> 01:13:27,800
And people are concerned about health issues.

749
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:34,925
And again, we have to reiterate that this is not, we cannot, cannot deny.

750
01:13:34,945 --> 01:13:37,467
I could address a lot of these comments.

751
01:13:37,727 --> 01:13:41,049
The phrase shot clock came from the federal law, not from Verizon.

752
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:49,777
We do have a right to deny applications and pursuing for the legal channels, but please take a look at the case history here.

753
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:51,779
I mean, law.

754
01:13:55,654 --> 01:14:02,360
I have gotten several questions about why in South Medford, why not in other parts of Medford?

755
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:08,786
And the answer is we have no idea why Verizon chose the neighborhoods that they chose.

756
01:14:08,847 --> 01:14:13,871
They have not expressed that to us when asked why these neighborhoods.

757
01:14:16,974 --> 01:14:17,034
OK.

758
01:14:21,071 --> 01:14:22,232
Is there an answer to that?

759
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:26,795
I actually got a call from residents today who couldn't be on the call, who said, why this neighborhood?

760
01:14:26,975 --> 01:14:34,019
And what is the plan going forward for how quickly other neighborhoods would be impacted?

761
01:14:35,881 --> 01:14:40,644
And then some people want it in their neighborhoods, would like higher speed self-service.

762
01:14:40,764 --> 01:14:48,469
And there are parts of Medford that have poor self-service like West Medford and up near the fells, and they would like better service.

763
01:14:50,738 --> 01:14:53,079
I didn't see anything site-specific in the chat.

764
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:55,620
Does anybody?

765
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,502
Tim, I think the council president had his hand up.

766
01:14:58,602 --> 01:15:00,202
I think I saw it a second ago.

767
01:15:00,242 --> 01:15:02,904
I don't know if you... All right, let me change my view.

768
01:15:05,785 --> 01:15:06,645
Too many things open.

769
01:15:07,706 --> 01:15:08,646
President Caravaglia?

770
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:16,530
Do I have that correct, Paul?

771
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:18,411
Yes, yeah, that's...

772
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:25,215
President Caravaglia, did you want to say something on this application for 13 Higgins Avenue?

773
01:15:25,835 --> 01:15:28,538
No, I have a general question, Tim, Mr. Chairman.

774
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:36,304
This afternoon, we had Congresswoman Clark in Medford, the fourth most powerful person in Congress here in our city.

775
01:15:37,185 --> 01:15:42,008
And during her visit, I saw there were city officials there.

776
01:15:43,369 --> 01:15:48,614
I want to know if this question was posed to her about these issues that we're having.

777
01:15:49,217 --> 01:15:49,698
this evening.

778
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,040
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend.

779
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:56,525
But I said, I think this is something that should have been asked to her when she was here today.

780
01:15:57,306 --> 01:15:59,208
And I don't know if that question was asked to her.

781
01:15:59,228 --> 01:16:01,891
We can we can ask Mr. Rodriguez.

782
01:16:02,852 --> 01:16:04,414
If that happened, I don't know the answer.

783
01:16:04,454 --> 01:16:07,297
I wasn't involved with conversations with Representative Barber today.

784
01:16:09,372 --> 01:16:11,814
I was not part of the conversation with Congresswoman Clark.

785
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:21,561
It was my understanding that that conversation centered around the pool testing program that got kids back to school in Medford, the American Rescue Plan, and some talk about vaccines.

786
01:16:22,922 --> 01:16:26,405
I can't confirm that small cell was discussed.

787
01:16:27,766 --> 01:16:28,066
Thank you.

788
01:16:31,609 --> 01:16:31,909
Thank you.

789
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:34,271
Yeah, thank you very much, President Cabello.

790
01:16:36,463 --> 01:16:39,924
Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and request a motion on 13 Higgins Avenue.

791
01:16:39,944 --> 01:16:55,648
I make a motion to approve 13 Higgins Avenue with the conditions that we have established.

792
01:16:56,748 --> 01:16:57,368
Do I hear a second?

793
01:17:01,969 --> 01:17:02,309
Second.

794
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:03,890
Thank you.

795
01:17:10,344 --> 01:17:12,406
Vote, Nisha Hunt?

796
01:17:13,987 --> 01:17:14,247
Yes.

797
01:17:14,947 --> 01:17:15,408
Paul Moki?

798
01:17:16,368 --> 01:17:16,629
Yes.

799
01:17:17,209 --> 01:17:17,889
Mary Ann O'Connor?

800
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:27,496
Mary Ann O'Connor?

801
01:17:27,716 --> 01:17:29,298
Yes.

802
01:17:30,338 --> 01:17:32,340
13 Higgins Avenue is granted with conditions.

803
01:17:34,893 --> 01:17:38,155
28 Killscythe Road, application number 42, sorry.

804
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:40,376
And did you vote, because I didn't catch your vote.

805
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:41,996
I did, I voted yes, sorry.

806
01:17:42,297 --> 01:17:43,137
Okay, thank you.

807
01:17:43,637 --> 01:17:45,898
Yeah, thank you for double checking.

808
01:17:46,058 --> 01:17:49,300
So the next application is number 42, 28 Killscythe Road.

809
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,621
The poll ID is 2948.

810
01:17:51,981 --> 01:17:52,601
My review.

811
01:17:59,337 --> 01:18:17,413
My takeaway from the review of this location was there's one three-story residence about 35 feet away, three more within 50 feet, dense residential neighborhood, and the hill puts the antenna in the plane of the third floor residential space on the closest structure.

812
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,769
So this is 28 Killscythe.

813
01:18:23,849 --> 01:18:27,370
Let me just, Dave, if you could check the emails, I'll check the chat.

814
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:37,273
And if someone could, if folks are trying to get my attention for 28 Killscythe, please let me know.

815
01:18:37,753 --> 01:18:42,794
If folks could, I do see everyone's comment, but it makes it difficult.

816
01:18:42,814 --> 01:18:44,474
I'm trying to get the site-specific comments.

817
01:18:44,814 --> 01:18:47,315
So thank you if you've submitted site-specific.

818
01:18:54,946 --> 01:19:02,231
And I don't see anything in... For 28- Mr. Chairman, there were no emails received on this site.

819
01:19:02,812 --> 01:19:03,052
Okay.

820
01:19:03,552 --> 01:19:04,393
All right.

821
01:19:04,433 --> 01:19:05,034
It's 28 Kilsyth.

822
01:19:05,834 --> 01:19:07,435
And I don't see anything in the chat.

823
01:19:08,496 --> 01:19:09,437
Am I missing anything?

824
01:19:09,877 --> 01:19:10,878
Other committee members here?

825
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:12,779
Not that I see.

826
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:17,223
Tim, is it helpful for me to go to Street View on these as we go through?

827
01:19:17,243 --> 01:19:21,526
I think if it's requested, I know that I definitely have

828
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,341
looked at every single one of these.

829
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:29,905
So if a committee member wants to go to Street View or the site specific commenter wants to go to Street View, we can certainly do that.

830
01:19:30,205 --> 01:19:33,828
And I'll just let people know that I can switch it to that.

831
01:19:33,848 --> 01:19:34,789
Okay.

832
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:35,509
All right.

833
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:39,352
All right, so do I hear a motion on 28 Killside?

834
01:19:44,923 --> 01:19:45,883
Let me mix it up a little bit.

835
01:19:46,004 --> 01:19:48,005
Someone else besides Alicia or Paul, I guess.

836
01:19:48,245 --> 01:19:51,406
I'm the chair, so I don't think I am allowed to motion.

837
01:19:54,228 --> 01:19:56,509
A motion to approve it with conditions.

838
01:19:56,529 --> 01:19:57,990
Okay.

839
01:20:00,031 --> 01:20:00,951
Do I hear a second on that?

840
01:20:03,492 --> 01:20:04,273
I'll second that.

841
01:20:05,453 --> 01:20:05,773
All right.

842
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,355
I'll just go to the same order for the vote.

843
01:20:09,415 --> 01:20:09,876
Alicia Hunt?

844
01:20:10,496 --> 01:20:10,736
Yes.

845
01:20:11,476 --> 01:20:11,937
Paul Moki?

846
01:20:13,117 --> 01:20:13,357
Yes.

847
01:20:13,938 --> 01:20:14,638
Marianne O'Connor?

848
01:20:16,642 --> 01:20:17,763
Um, yes.

849
01:20:18,964 --> 01:20:19,324
And me?

850
01:20:19,504 --> 01:20:19,744
Yes.

851
01:20:23,767 --> 01:20:26,729
Next one is 48 Granville Avenue.

852
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:36,675
I know, um, there is, uh, I have received the comment, uh, comments from the folks who live close by.

853
01:20:36,695 --> 01:20:39,777
Um, and I'll go over my review of this one.

854
01:20:39,837 --> 01:20:42,138
It's within 18 feet of a three story residential structure.

855
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:44,720
Um, as we can see right there.

856
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:47,895
and it's within 50 feet of another one.

857
01:20:48,456 --> 01:20:59,619
The plan indicates that the streetlight will be removed from the pole, but there is no acceptable alternate location for a streetlight in this vicinity.

858
01:21:01,759 --> 01:21:03,600
So two questions.

859
01:21:04,945 --> 01:21:07,566
there is a poll at the corner of Winchester and Granville.

860
01:21:08,927 --> 01:21:13,469
I don't, from my understanding, I don't believe it was listed as an alternate poll location.

861
01:21:13,529 --> 01:21:26,816
I may be mistaken, but I'd either like to see if we can move the end to there, which is further away from residences, or if there's something, we gotta do something with that light.

862
01:21:29,857 --> 01:21:30,217
So let me,

863
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:44,189
I will summarize the comment as being that the people that live in that house close by objects to installing an antenna there.

864
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:51,296
And they would like Verizon to explore an alternate location for that antenna.

865
01:21:52,215 --> 01:21:56,956
Um, and, uh, like I said, there's no alternate location for that particular street light.

866
01:21:57,236 --> 01:22:00,257
It's a dead end street, and that basically is the light for the street.

867
01:22:01,037 --> 01:22:11,479
Um, so Verizon could talk about the light and see if, um, there's a opportunity for the pole at the corner of Granville and Winchester, as opposed to this one.

868
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,580
Alicia, could you rotate the screen to look at that other pole?

869
01:22:17,078 --> 01:22:18,099
Hey, Tim, this is Sean.

870
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:21,985
I can speak to the light that the light will will be remaining.

871
01:22:22,005 --> 01:22:23,407
Okay.

872
01:22:23,767 --> 01:22:27,152
And as as to the poll there, that's at the corner of the street.

873
01:22:28,108 --> 01:22:30,210
That has a couple of no-nos on it for us.

874
01:22:30,491 --> 01:22:33,213
It's what's called a three-way junction pole.

875
01:22:33,253 --> 01:22:40,261
So primary power runs up and down a street, and then primary power comes to the pole another way, three-way junction.

876
01:22:40,701 --> 01:22:44,505
And you can also see the equipment up on the top of the primary lines there.

877
01:22:44,525 --> 01:22:45,506
They're called reclosers.

878
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:48,109
We can't attach to a pole that has that equipment on it.

879
01:22:53,387 --> 01:23:02,033
And you had the other polls, at least three of them, I recall in the application that you had also scratched because of various reasons.

880
01:23:03,514 --> 01:23:07,978
Could you discuss some of those alternate locations quickly?

881
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:11,780
Sure.

882
01:23:12,301 --> 01:23:19,326
If you want to, we have poll 645, which is if you go up the end of Granville here and take a right,

883
01:23:20,049 --> 01:23:23,431
The next pole you'll see has those same reclosers up on the top.

884
01:23:23,591 --> 01:23:27,194
So it's not a pole that we can use.

885
01:23:31,377 --> 01:23:37,341
And then if we go the other way up the street, you see that first pole, it's got a transformer on it.

886
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:38,542
We can't attach to that.

887
01:23:39,662 --> 01:23:42,204
If you go to the next pole, it also has a transformer on it.

888
01:23:42,364 --> 01:23:43,265
We can't attach to that.

889
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:46,407
And as we had talked about in our

890
01:23:47,403 --> 01:23:53,025
meeting last week, once you get two or three poles away, you were really losing the, the RF coverage objective.

891
01:23:53,045 --> 01:23:55,686
We had hoped to satisfy with the location.

892
01:23:59,307 --> 01:23:59,607
Thank you.

893
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:10,691
So this is a situation where, you know, we're even in a tighter spot because the residents have vocally stated that they do not want this where it's going.

894
01:24:11,511 --> 01:24:12,892
Um, and

895
01:24:14,272 --> 01:24:19,976
If I understand everything correctly, which I pretty sure I do, um, we deny it and it goes there anyway.

896
01:24:21,017 --> 01:24:34,967
Um, so it, it sounds like though that one of the objections that at least the one that I was, had processed, was it about the streetlight and if the streetlight is staying, um, that helps some of them.

897
01:24:35,447 --> 01:24:41,752
We did have one resident indicate early on in the chat that he lives at 48 Granville and wanted to speak.

898
01:24:43,113 --> 01:24:43,393
Oh, okay.

899
01:24:43,698 --> 01:24:46,420
Yep, that was one of the speak on 48 Granville.

900
01:24:47,361 --> 01:24:47,861
Oh, that's Lou.

901
01:24:47,961 --> 01:24:50,103
Okay, that is the Roy Mr. Roy.

902
01:24:50,123 --> 01:24:50,603
Okay.

903
01:24:51,564 --> 01:25:01,752
Thank you, Alicia, want me to know that there were no emails received on this location, although didn't mention that did indicate that he would like to offer comedy.

904
01:25:02,612 --> 01:25:06,215
Okay, let's go to Mr. Roy and then we'll go to Councilmarks.

905
01:25:06,755 --> 01:25:08,076
All right, I'll ask him to unmute.

906
01:25:11,485 --> 01:25:18,126
Hi, this is Charlene Roy and it was because of the street streetlight removal was the biggest concern.

907
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:28,348
But also that it's only 18 feet from our house and it's I'm sitting in my living room watching TV and the pole, it looks like it's 10 feet away from the house.

908
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:30,828
And I'm really concerned with the distance.

909
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:36,309
Thank you.

910
01:25:36,409 --> 01:25:37,590
And what was your first name again?

911
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:37,910
I'm sorry.

912
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:39,270
I know we met Charlene Roy.

913
01:25:39,915 --> 01:25:46,458
Charlene, okay, thank you, Charlene.

914
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:50,720
And why was it mentioned that the light was gonna be removed in the first place?

915
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:52,901
That's a good question.

916
01:25:52,941 --> 01:26:07,007
They have stated that it's not gonna be removed, so I'm going to, if the committee so moves to grant with conditions, I wanna have the condition on there that the light must remain on that pole.

917
01:26:10,982 --> 01:26:16,989
So anyway, so thank you very much, Councilor Marks.

918
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:25,319
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

919
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:29,584
I would just respectfully ask we have from what I can see,

920
01:26:30,071 --> 01:26:33,132
only five residents that have raised their hand to speak.

921
01:26:33,172 --> 01:26:47,696
I know there may be some other comments, sites specific, but I'm not sure why we can't go through the residents that raised their hand, listen to their comments at first, so they don't have to stay in a potential meeting for three to four hours.

922
01:26:48,176 --> 01:26:51,917
That would make more sense to me, but just wanted to put that out there.

923
01:26:52,303 --> 01:26:54,264
I'll take the suggestion, Councilor Marks.

924
01:26:55,045 --> 01:26:58,426
My screen has multiple windows open, including the chat.

925
01:26:58,487 --> 01:27:01,708
So let me go back to make sure I see everyone who has their hands up.

926
01:27:01,728 --> 01:27:09,092
I was trying to get- On that, Joseph Nazaro has said in the chat that he has a question on Grand Hill Street.

927
01:27:10,773 --> 01:27:11,954
Okay, let's take him first, please.

928
01:27:14,335 --> 01:27:18,478
Miranda's gonna start unmuting people for us as we call on them.

929
01:27:22,799 --> 01:27:23,079
Hello?

930
01:27:23,099 --> 01:27:26,761
We can hear you.

931
01:27:26,901 --> 01:27:27,201
Yeah.

932
01:27:27,901 --> 01:27:30,823
I wanted to say at the beginning that I went out looking for the poles.

933
01:27:31,403 --> 01:27:33,164
It was very difficult to find them.

934
01:27:35,205 --> 01:27:41,547
The numbers didn't jive with what I was trying to see on the map and what the applications say.

935
01:27:41,628 --> 01:27:47,790
So I wonder if the abutters did indeed get notice if they were living near a pole.

936
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:50,932
But for this specific pole,

937
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,942
I want to know how far it is to the Tufts playing fields.

938
01:27:56,043 --> 01:28:06,930
And does the ordinance in Medford deny how close to the playing fields can these antennas be?

939
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:13,434
I could field some of those questions.

940
01:28:13,494 --> 01:28:17,016
So Verizon has stated, and it is my understanding,

941
01:28:18,686 --> 01:28:26,233
that the offsets that they are using are based off of their safety standards.

942
01:28:27,995 --> 01:28:39,907
And the distance to the playing fields at Tufts, I don't have it exactly on here, but it looks to be 200, 300 feet.

943
01:28:45,258 --> 01:28:48,739
So you're talking about the Tufts playing field basically close by, correct?

944
01:28:48,979 --> 01:28:51,320
I think he means Tufts Park.

945
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:52,380
Tufts Park.

946
01:28:52,400 --> 01:29:01,702
And that the far end of it where people are known to run dogs is on the other side of Winchester and Granville.

947
01:29:03,323 --> 01:29:03,503
Right.

948
01:29:04,843 --> 01:29:10,064
Just looking at it, it looks to be over, I mean, at least 150 feet, if not more than that.

949
01:29:10,084 --> 01:29:12,645
And what's the ordinance say, please?

950
01:29:13,797 --> 01:29:20,382
There isn't any ordinance regarding the small cell infrastructure.

951
01:29:20,943 --> 01:29:22,224
No ordinance has been created.

952
01:29:22,264 --> 01:29:23,225
There's a policy.

953
01:29:23,265 --> 01:29:24,646
The policy doesn't have setbacks.

954
01:29:25,247 --> 01:29:29,630
The policy references the FCC standards.

955
01:29:32,653 --> 01:29:36,276
And there's no offset that would...

956
01:29:38,502 --> 01:29:43,284
because this is my concern also in the full Colby Street poll, but which we haven't got to yet.

957
01:29:43,865 --> 01:29:49,848
But the other question is the poll numbers and the street addresses don't seem to match.

958
01:29:51,388 --> 01:29:52,909
Is that my observation?

959
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:53,909
Am I just dumb or?

960
01:29:53,929 --> 01:29:58,672
No, the addresses are approximate.

961
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:04,910
And then the poll numbers are in the application to get you at the poll.

962
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:08,492
And then they're all mapped on this map here.

963
01:30:08,792 --> 01:30:11,513
The exact location of the poll are mapped here.

964
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:17,637
So the abutters did get notice, the people who were meant to get notice got notice.

965
01:30:17,877 --> 01:30:20,258
Yeah, within 300 feet of the poll location.

966
01:30:22,299 --> 01:30:26,341
The 300 feet put so many people within it that

967
01:30:28,295 --> 01:30:37,200
it can't help but get, like it goes about two blocks out of each, like on this map, 50, right?

968
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:42,303
Like 300 feet is gonna be up here, right?

969
01:30:42,383 --> 01:30:44,224
So we're looking at some pretty big circles.

970
01:30:44,324 --> 01:30:54,049
And we actually, in our applications, they show us the map with the radius of, oh, they show us a 500 foot radius.

971
01:30:54,089 --> 01:30:54,469
Hold on.

972
01:30:55,009 --> 01:30:55,430
It's not the 300.

973
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:55,750
All right.

974
01:31:19,592 --> 01:31:22,214
A lot of folks are sending comments in about the noise.

975
01:31:22,715 --> 01:31:30,582
One of our standard conditions is that there can be no audible noise at the sidewalk level and the dwelling level.

976
01:31:30,942 --> 01:31:33,905
And if they are, then they're not meeting the conditions of the approval.

977
01:31:33,925 --> 01:31:36,347
And I don't want to be surprising.

978
01:31:39,322 --> 01:31:42,563
This map that I'm using is located.

979
01:31:42,603 --> 01:31:45,143
Somebody asked about the map and the exact locations.

980
01:31:45,263 --> 01:31:54,345
This map that we're using is linked on the city's website on the 5G small cell committee page.

981
01:31:55,445 --> 01:31:57,005
And you can, it's this.

982
01:32:01,326 --> 01:32:05,547
I have been switching between the one that allows street views and this one.

983
01:32:11,305 --> 01:32:17,506
So if people wanted to follow along and zoom in on each of them, I was just trying to see if I could grab the URL.

984
01:32:17,526 --> 01:32:21,667
What are you trying to look for?

985
01:32:23,367 --> 01:32:28,288
The URL that we used for this map, the one that's embedded on the city's website.

986
01:32:29,128 --> 01:32:35,629
So if I switch my webpage to go get the URL, I'll change what everybody is looking at.

987
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:40,730
Okay, well, let me do that and just send it in the chat to everybody.

988
01:32:45,995 --> 01:32:51,900
And to be clear, the link that Tim is sending is available on the city's website for everybody.

989
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,722
We're just putting it in the chat for convenience.

990
01:33:03,949 --> 01:33:07,251
Was there anybody else who wanted to speak on Granville?

991
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:11,615
I think Mr. Gazzaro still has one more question.

992
01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:29,199
Yeah, yeah, further to the address because I was at Colby Street and for Colby Street is one end of the street, but the pole is the other end of the street, the very other end of the street.

993
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,401
So it's like about three or 400 feet away.

994
01:33:33,461 --> 01:33:35,922
It's the length of the building on Colby Street.

995
01:33:36,662 --> 01:33:37,882
Is that an exception?

996
01:33:39,323 --> 01:33:43,865
So there are several poles in between that weren't the correct poles.

997
01:33:46,797 --> 01:33:49,179
Can we look at that when we get to Colby Street?

998
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:51,221
Yeah, we'll look at it when we get to Colby Street.

999
01:33:51,241 --> 01:34:00,288
I understand that the comment as far as the address doesn't line up exactly with where the poll location is, just because the address is the house or the building.

1000
01:34:00,588 --> 01:34:03,891
And then the poll is most of these right up front.

1001
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:06,473
Some of them, they're around the corner.

1002
01:34:06,493 --> 01:34:14,139
So, and I've made note of the ones that are on a different right-of-way, you know, sometimes around the corner.

1003
01:34:17,114 --> 01:34:29,580
Okay, so let's go, I said Councilor Marks, and then we're gonna go to Joseph Nazaro after that.

1004
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,261
He just spoke.

1005
01:34:32,161 --> 01:34:33,242
Oh, okay, all right, sorry.

1006
01:34:34,982 --> 01:34:37,984
So Councilor Marks, and then if there's someone else.

1007
01:34:41,165 --> 01:34:46,628
It looks like a resident's raising their hand visually, Fire Tao.

1008
01:34:47,733 --> 01:34:49,074
for coming on this site.

1009
01:34:49,474 --> 01:34:50,996
Okay, yeah, let's go with them, please.

1010
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:55,019
Hi, Miranda, thank you.

1011
01:34:57,721 --> 01:35:01,365
And we need each person's name and address for the record.

1012
01:35:01,385 --> 01:35:08,030
And Miranda, if you can try to capture those for us, not just the address they're speaking at, but their address.

1013
01:35:08,951 --> 01:35:09,351
Hello?

1014
01:35:10,452 --> 01:35:10,752
Hello?

1015
01:35:11,673 --> 01:35:12,054
Hello?

1016
01:35:13,575 --> 01:35:14,476
We got you.

1017
01:35:15,256 --> 01:35:15,677
Thank you.

1018
01:35:16,815 --> 01:35:24,679
The name is Andrew Castanetti, and I've been trying to speak since Councilor Mark spoke earlier.

1019
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:41,208
And I want to say he brought up some great points, and I understand it's a done deal, it's a slam dunk, according to Verizon and their lobbyists and the government.

1020
01:35:42,969 --> 01:35:43,389
However,

1021
01:35:46,153 --> 01:35:55,781
Verizon's implying or stating, and as Alicia Hunt said in today's transcript, I'll quote, we'll just have to trust it works.

1022
01:35:58,183 --> 01:36:12,535
I would say trust is good, may be good, but it would be much better if Verizon could place a $10 billion surety health safety bond

1023
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:14,402
that'll be much better.

1024
01:36:14,922 --> 01:36:19,886
Trust me on that one, because there are no guarantees in life or on life.

1025
01:36:20,747 --> 01:36:26,131
And I can give you one example, even if it is so safe, as we speak, according to GARP.

1026
01:36:27,192 --> 01:36:32,816
However, 50 years ago, we were painting our house inside our bedrooms.

1027
01:36:33,456 --> 01:36:37,760
And then 35 years later, we had an issue called lead paint.

1028
01:36:38,921 --> 01:36:39,061
So

1029
01:36:40,167 --> 01:36:47,750
Would Verizon, with their surety, place a $10 billion bond in case there's any health issues?

1030
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:50,971
I do have a site specific on Bradley Road.

1031
01:36:51,031 --> 01:37:01,074
I have a loved one whose apartment is directly across from the pole, 10 feet higher than the pole on the fourth floor when you get to Bradley Road.

1032
01:37:02,054 --> 01:37:09,257
So I'm asking Verizon, clear as a bell, would they have the decency to put up a $10 billion

1033
01:37:10,473 --> 01:37:12,996
surety health safety bond.

1034
01:37:13,817 --> 01:37:15,658
I'm asking that to Verizon.

1035
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:18,601
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

1036
01:37:19,122 --> 01:37:19,402
Thank you.

1037
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,523
Good to hear your voice.

1038
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:21,464
Thank you.

1039
01:37:22,826 --> 01:37:27,130
Verizon, could we get a response to Mr. Castaneda for that question?

1040
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:29,492
Can I also get his address for the record?

1041
01:37:30,193 --> 01:37:31,555
Oh, Clifton Street, C-U-S-H-I-N-G.

1042
01:37:40,768 --> 01:37:45,830
Stan and Mike, the question regarding... Yeah, sure, Mr. Chair.

1043
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:47,570
Yeah, the response is no.

1044
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:55,633
And as we talked about the last time, local regulation on the basis of health and safety effects is not permitted under the federal law.

1045
01:37:57,373 --> 01:37:57,653
Thank you.

1046
01:37:59,114 --> 01:38:02,715
Okay, in the name of duty and humanity and for safety, the answer is no.

1047
01:38:04,255 --> 01:38:05,776
Yeah, we've got them on the record.

1048
01:38:08,605 --> 01:38:20,972
And I hope folks, you know, friendly with a lot of folks around here and I you know, I hope people understand where I'm coming from and more than happy to continue the discussions, why I'm sitting where I am.

1049
01:38:21,412 --> 01:38:23,333
And constant marks also wanted to speak on this.

1050
01:38:41,907 --> 01:38:42,387
Did we lose him?

1051
01:38:43,368 --> 01:38:44,909
I'm here, Tim.

1052
01:38:44,929 --> 01:38:49,411
I already spoke, but I would hope that you would just call upon the people that have their hands raised.

1053
01:38:49,812 --> 01:38:50,412
Okay, thank you.

1054
01:38:50,452 --> 01:38:51,173
Yeah, I did.

1055
01:38:51,253 --> 01:38:58,077
All right, so we'll take a few minutes here to get some comments.

1056
01:38:59,377 --> 01:39:03,640
So we'll go with Dennis Dettling, just going down the list that I got here.

1057
01:39:05,461 --> 01:39:06,842
So we can go ahead and unmute Dennis.

1058
01:39:17,664 --> 01:39:18,704
Can someone please unmute Dennis?

1059
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:18,985
Thank you.

1060
01:39:19,105 --> 01:39:19,805
Yeah, sorry.

1061
01:39:19,925 --> 01:39:21,786
It took me a little while to click the right thing.

1062
01:39:22,346 --> 01:39:22,826
That's okay.

1063
01:39:22,846 --> 01:39:25,507
I thought someone else was doing it for us, but thank you very much.

1064
01:39:26,407 --> 01:39:41,833
I've been involved with the city council meetings and politics, and I've been on the same team with Alicia Hunt as far as getting municipal aggregation, and I'm very much concerned about climate change.

1065
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:55,402
And anyway, I just wanted to say, so I am concerned about two locations near me, 42 Quincy and 90 North.

1066
01:39:56,803 --> 01:39:59,045
But in general, I wanted to know, I have two,

1067
01:40:01,893 --> 01:40:03,113
Three questions, actually.

1068
01:40:03,974 --> 01:40:21,739
One is why we dropped the requirement of setback from dwellings, because we have a requirement for the setback from parks and playgrounds and schools.

1069
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:28,842
And if that's not about public safety, then please explain that.

1070
01:40:30,623 --> 01:40:32,785
and why doesn't it apply to dwellings?

1071
01:40:33,506 --> 01:40:44,817
The second question I have is why did we give up on the canister enclosures so easily when it turns out that other cities require canister enclosures and these are

1072
01:40:46,667 --> 01:40:59,435
composite or whatever materials they are that allow the microwaves to go through, but they protect the wires and other sensitive things that are inside that thing.

1073
01:40:59,796 --> 01:41:01,597
That doesn't seem to be right to me.

1074
01:41:02,898 --> 01:41:07,380
And are we following up on the liability insurance?

1075
01:41:08,881 --> 01:41:10,903
I think that's an absolute requirement.

1076
01:41:12,144 --> 01:41:14,085
And finally, the fourth question is,

1077
01:41:15,715 --> 01:41:18,877
Are we making an effort to appeal this to the federal government?

1078
01:41:19,337 --> 01:41:23,700
And these are all things that were requested by unanimous votes of the city council.

1079
01:41:25,261 --> 01:41:29,664
And I wanna know whether they, I want answers to these questions, please.

1080
01:41:29,684 --> 01:41:31,184
Okay, thank you.

1081
01:41:31,645 --> 01:41:34,166
I can address the setbacks.

1082
01:41:34,366 --> 01:41:44,913
So it says, the policy says that setbacks can be created, but the policy that the applications were submitted under never defined any setbacks.

1083
01:41:46,023 --> 01:41:47,365
So that's the answer there.

1084
01:41:49,347 --> 01:41:56,314
So even if we were to, if the administration were to create a policy that had setbacks it wouldn't apply to these applications.

1085
01:41:56,915 --> 01:42:04,544
The canisters, I personally thought and the other committee members thought that canisters were worse as far as visual pollution goes.

1086
01:42:07,188 --> 01:42:14,032
These are smaller without the canisters and they're less visually obstructing to me.

1087
01:42:14,052 --> 01:42:15,613
So that was the reason there.

1088
01:42:15,633 --> 01:42:18,575
And the other committee members agreed.

1089
01:42:19,796 --> 01:42:24,118
And the liability insurance, the renewal of that is part of the conditions.

1090
01:42:24,358 --> 01:42:26,439
So I agree with you, it's a very important piece of it.

1091
01:42:26,579 --> 01:42:31,762
So because it's been a year, the certificates have expired.

1092
01:42:32,843 --> 01:42:34,404
So they would need to generate new certificates.

1093
01:42:37,988 --> 01:42:40,529
I believe those were your questions.

1094
01:42:40,989 --> 01:42:52,173
The fourth one was about whether we're doing anything about the federal policy appealing to the FCC or for President Biden or federal government senators.

1095
01:42:52,653 --> 01:42:54,394
I mean, the city has the ability to do that.

1096
01:42:55,354 --> 01:42:59,995
I'm not aware of any actions taken by this administration or any other entity in the city.

1097
01:43:00,435 --> 01:43:01,636
Are you going to agree to that?

1098
01:43:01,696 --> 01:43:04,897
Is that going to be, is anyone going to make a motion for that?

1099
01:43:05,952 --> 01:43:13,654
that it be added as, I assume that you have jurisdiction over this as you're the committee that's been appointed.

1100
01:43:14,234 --> 01:43:18,896
We have jurisdiction over the policy that was written by the city's administration.

1101
01:43:19,436 --> 01:43:26,558
So I believe that would be in someone else's court.

1102
01:43:26,818 --> 01:43:30,459
This committee is reviewing the applications based off of the policy that was written.

1103
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:33,720
We have, as I said before, a pretty narrow purview on this.

1104
01:43:35,349 --> 01:43:36,770
And I can't speak for other city entities.

1105
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:42,233
All right, well, the two poles that are near my house, I don't want them.

1106
01:43:43,033 --> 01:43:52,137
And I wanna know, have any residents requested that they have the 5G near their home?

1107
01:43:53,518 --> 01:43:55,499
I mean, what is the basis of this?

1108
01:43:56,739 --> 01:43:59,361
The basis is the federal order.

1109
01:43:59,381 --> 01:44:02,102
I mean, I'm sorry.

1110
01:44:03,999 --> 01:44:08,042
the locations, the locations that were chosen by Verizon.

1111
01:44:08,062 --> 01:44:09,883
Do we have an explanation for that?

1112
01:44:10,383 --> 01:44:17,648
And does that explanation include residents requesting that these transponders be near there?

1113
01:44:18,088 --> 01:44:19,670
Do they want the 5G?

1114
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:22,511
Or would they go for broadband?

1115
01:44:23,012 --> 01:44:26,734
I believe there are some residents who have specifically requested 5G.

1116
01:44:28,135 --> 01:44:29,136
In those locations?

1117
01:44:29,859 --> 01:44:33,762
I don't know, we can ask Verizon to address that question.

1118
01:44:36,124 --> 01:44:45,291
And I do know that there's a desire for folks want 5G, a lot of folks want it.

1119
01:44:45,451 --> 01:44:46,552
I know a lot of folks don't want it.

1120
01:44:48,173 --> 01:44:58,742
So Verizon, Stan or Mike, have there been specific requests from residents to want antennas in the vicinity of their home?

1121
01:45:05,652 --> 01:45:12,275
I don't know if someone on the team can answer that, but I would say just generally, Mr. Chairman, we're here at a hearing about specific sites.

1122
01:45:12,335 --> 01:45:20,479
I thought we had ground rules here where general comments were being taken up last week, and we were gonna move through these applications.

1123
01:45:20,979 --> 01:45:23,201
And I would request that you move through the applications.

1124
01:45:24,421 --> 01:45:32,445
We're hearing a lot of stalling going on to try to delay this, and we would like to get these applications through the committee, please.

1125
01:45:34,814 --> 01:45:35,654
There's a response there.

1126
01:45:36,955 --> 01:45:37,275
Thank you.

1127
01:45:37,355 --> 01:45:41,378
All right, so... Can I get the address for the record?

1128
01:45:41,518 --> 01:45:41,778
Sorry.

1129
01:45:42,919 --> 01:45:44,680
Oh, 120 North Street.

1130
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:45,880
Thank you.

1131
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:46,340
Yeah.

1132
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:54,205
So do we have other site-specific comments on 48 Granville Avenue that remain?

1133
01:45:56,426 --> 01:45:58,267
I want to get to the applications as well.

1134
01:45:58,547 --> 01:46:03,590
It's... All right.

1135
01:46:04,336 --> 01:46:11,183
I know that there are hands up, but I agree that we need to continue to move on.

1136
01:46:11,223 --> 01:46:15,287
We've heard a lot of general comments and we have to continue.

1137
01:46:17,970 --> 01:46:27,700
So if there's no other comments on 48 Granville Avenue, I'd like to introduce a condition that the light will remain, which is different from what it says on the plans.

1138
01:46:30,875 --> 01:46:33,616
Um, so I'd like, uh, to hear a motion.

1139
01:46:33,636 --> 01:46:43,039
Uh, and if the motion is, uh, to grant with conditions, I would like, uh, that, uh, member to add that the light will remain.

1140
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,221
If they agree, they still moved.

1141
01:46:50,522 --> 01:46:59,805
Motion to approve with the regular conditions and the, that the light remains on this poll in contrary to what is on their application.

1142
01:46:59,825 --> 01:47:00,565
Okay.

1143
01:47:03,098 --> 01:47:03,678
Do I hear a second?

1144
01:47:06,279 --> 01:47:06,579
Second.

1145
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:11,980
All right, Alicia Hunt, to vote?

1146
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:12,460
Yes.

1147
01:47:13,341 --> 01:47:13,821
Paul Mulkey?

1148
01:47:14,941 --> 01:47:15,201
Yes.

1149
01:47:16,981 --> 01:47:17,642
Mary Ann O'Connor?

1150
01:47:26,104 --> 01:47:26,424
Mary Ann?

1151
01:47:27,824 --> 01:47:28,084
Yes.

1152
01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:30,245
And I'm a yes as well.

1153
01:47:30,985 --> 01:47:31,565
Light will remain.

1154
01:47:33,672 --> 01:47:34,092
All right, thank you.

1155
01:47:34,112 --> 01:47:36,613
We'll move on to 25 Dexter Street.

1156
01:47:40,655 --> 01:47:42,856
So this poll is at the corner of Dexter and Bow.

1157
01:47:43,296 --> 01:47:45,317
It's actually in the Bow Street right-of-way.

1158
01:47:45,337 --> 01:47:49,219
And it's within 20 feet of a three-story residential structure.

1159
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:50,220
The poll ID is 4312.

1160
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:54,982
Let me get to that one.

1161
01:47:59,086 --> 01:48:04,831
All right, and if we could check emails and chat on specific comments to the site?

1162
01:48:06,212 --> 01:48:07,313
Mr. Chairman, emails received.

1163
01:48:08,074 --> 01:48:08,454
OK.

1164
01:48:09,515 --> 01:48:12,838
Are there any hands raised on this one?

1165
01:48:13,638 --> 01:48:13,758
OK.

1166
01:48:20,164 --> 01:48:21,545
I'll wait until we get the map there.

1167
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,441
I'm still just going through the comments.

1168
01:48:24,621 --> 01:48:28,123
I'm getting sort of inundated with general comments.

1169
01:48:28,623 --> 01:48:32,425
I am going to ask people to please stop sending me general comments.

1170
01:48:34,106 --> 01:48:35,307
I'm not ignoring questions.

1171
01:48:35,327 --> 01:48:37,869
There's been a ton of public comment period.

1172
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:41,851
And you can choose your carrier.

1173
01:48:43,692 --> 01:48:47,114
Sorry, is it the one that has the Dexter Street sign on it?

1174
01:48:47,134 --> 01:48:50,596
I was trying to go to ground level to see it.

1175
01:48:54,607 --> 01:48:55,708
Let me just see here.

1176
01:48:57,668 --> 01:48:57,969
Yeah.

1177
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:02,450
This one here.

1178
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:05,191
And so this is it at ground level.

1179
01:49:05,531 --> 01:49:06,192
That's it, yeah.

1180
01:49:10,893 --> 01:49:14,895
This one looks like they were going to need to install a new pole.

1181
01:49:15,655 --> 01:49:21,577
The diagram showed it going taller than that current pole is.

1182
01:49:25,847 --> 01:49:31,029
I think you're looking at the wrong poll.

1183
01:49:31,069 --> 01:49:33,790
I think it's across the street from there.

1184
01:49:34,251 --> 01:49:34,591
Okay.

1185
01:49:34,671 --> 01:49:35,911
Thank you very much.

1186
01:49:36,352 --> 01:49:39,693
This one, the one without the light, that.

1187
01:49:39,973 --> 01:49:40,553
Thank you.

1188
01:49:41,374 --> 01:49:41,654
Yes.

1189
01:49:41,694 --> 01:49:42,074
Correct.

1190
01:49:42,314 --> 01:49:42,614
Thank you.

1191
01:49:43,955 --> 01:49:44,895
I appreciate that.

1192
01:49:45,975 --> 01:49:52,198
So it's the current poll there is according to this diagram that was submitted

1193
01:49:53,197 --> 01:49:55,339
existing top was at 34 feet.

1194
01:49:55,799 --> 01:49:58,941
So they're just going to they're going to go with a pole that's four feet taller.

1195
01:49:59,402 --> 01:50:17,655
And I just I'm sure that we asked this last week, and I wanted to make sure we were clear that there's no intention to extend the pole or put a topper but rather in a situation like this, because this is the first we're discussing specifically, it would be a new pole and you would be replacing it.

1196
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:22,860
I can answer that, yes.

1197
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,061
It will be a new pole.

1198
01:50:24,801 --> 01:50:33,526
And when we submit our applications, National Grid does their survey, and they tell us that the pole needs to be replaced for some reason, maybe because this one was leaning a little bit.

1199
01:50:33,566 --> 01:50:36,567
They thought a new pole would be needed for the antenna.

1200
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:48,113
So it will be higher at that point than what's currently there?

1201
01:50:49,673 --> 01:50:50,494
It will be higher, yes.

1202
01:50:51,751 --> 01:50:53,112
That's my understanding of the review too.

1203
01:50:54,152 --> 01:50:55,993
Yes, Marion, that was my understanding of this review too.

1204
01:50:56,014 --> 01:51:01,837
I didn't have any other questions on this location.

1205
01:51:01,857 --> 01:51:03,598
All right.

1206
01:51:03,958 --> 01:51:09,061
I can't even remember if I already asked this.

1207
01:51:09,081 --> 01:51:11,202
Did we receive any emails on 25 Dexter Street?

1208
01:51:11,222 --> 01:51:15,405
I don't think we did, right?

1209
01:51:16,325 --> 01:51:18,547
I haven't seen any chats or anything either.

1210
01:51:19,107 --> 01:51:20,628
OK, I don't see anything.

1211
01:51:22,379 --> 01:51:25,281
All right, do I have a motion on 25 Dexter Street?

1212
01:51:27,342 --> 01:51:30,424
I'll make a motion to approve that with the conditions we adopted.

1213
01:51:30,444 --> 01:51:32,125
Do we hear a second?

1214
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:35,567
Second.

1215
01:51:37,128 --> 01:51:37,849
Alicia Hunt, vote?

1216
01:51:38,729 --> 01:51:38,969
Yes.

1217
01:51:39,890 --> 01:51:40,450
Paul Moki?

1218
01:51:41,251 --> 01:51:41,491
Yes.

1219
01:51:42,231 --> 01:51:42,672
Mary Ann?

1220
01:51:43,472 --> 01:51:43,732
Yes.

1221
01:51:44,373 --> 01:51:45,313
Tim is a yes as well.

1222
01:51:45,333 --> 01:51:47,555
39 Albion Street.

1223
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:55,222
It's 39 Albion Street, application number seven.

1224
01:51:56,503 --> 01:52:03,348
Poll number is 4732, and it's on the corner of William Street, and it's actually in the William Street right-of-way.

1225
01:52:03,368 --> 01:52:07,650
It's within 20 feet of one three-story residence and within 25 feet of another.

1226
01:52:13,654 --> 01:52:14,615
There's the location there.

1227
01:52:16,656 --> 01:52:18,977
Have we received any emails regarding 39 Albion Street?

1228
01:52:22,241 --> 01:52:23,001
No emails received.

1229
01:52:23,762 --> 01:52:30,926
All right, let me just check the chat here and folks let me know on the team if we received anything for 39 Albion Street.

1230
01:52:38,571 --> 01:52:41,813
This is another one where it looks like it needs to be a new poll.

1231
01:52:41,833 --> 01:52:49,838
Yeah, there's a few of those.

1232
01:52:51,387 --> 01:52:54,349
some mid mid pole swap to some of them.

1233
01:52:56,471 --> 01:52:58,853
This is the location here on William Street.

1234
01:52:58,873 --> 01:53:00,975
Yep.

1235
01:53:26,848 --> 01:53:30,910
All right, Dennis, I have you in for 42 Quincy and 90 North.

1236
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:32,111
I just scrolled back to the top.

1237
01:53:33,432 --> 01:53:35,913
And I see other people's too, Brookings.

1238
01:53:37,014 --> 01:53:37,994
So we'll get to those.

1239
01:53:38,014 --> 01:53:42,837
All right, I don't see anything for 39 L beyond.

1240
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:52,823
If you have- The new pole at the top of this is gonna take it up above the existing houses.

1241
01:53:58,050 --> 01:53:58,170
Okay.

1242
01:53:58,210 --> 01:54:00,171
All right.

1243
01:54:00,231 --> 01:54:03,733
Do we hear a motion?

1244
01:54:08,035 --> 01:54:14,418
This poll is going to be replaced or put on top?

1245
01:54:14,438 --> 01:54:15,739
This is going to be replaced.

1246
01:54:15,799 --> 01:54:25,984
The existing utility poll, the elevation is 29 feet 6 inches, according to this survey, and they're proposing to put the antenna at

1247
01:54:28,443 --> 01:54:32,246
The bottom of their utenna equipment is at 34 feet.

1248
01:54:33,767 --> 01:54:37,530
So they're going to be going up that six feet higher than the current pole.

1249
01:54:38,211 --> 01:54:42,774
Thank you.

1250
01:54:44,456 --> 01:54:48,879
Most of these tend to be above the plane of homes, unless like kill site that was on a hill.

1251
01:54:48,899 --> 01:54:54,443
Sorry, I apologize if I'm making people a little dizzy.

1252
01:54:54,523 --> 01:54:56,385
I just wanted to have a good view of these.

1253
01:55:05,594 --> 01:55:08,575
Yep.

1254
01:55:08,595 --> 01:55:11,016
That's the view where we can sort of see it'll go up higher.

1255
01:55:12,476 --> 01:55:16,737
And that's one where you can see it probably is a new pole.

1256
01:55:17,157 --> 01:55:18,558
You can tell just by looking at the base of it.

1257
01:55:19,098 --> 01:55:23,699
You can tell by looking at the pole itself, but they haven't they haven't done the finish work on the concrete.

1258
01:55:23,899 --> 01:55:25,080
That's what I was referring to before.

1259
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:26,500
So quite a number of them like that.

1260
01:55:27,978 --> 01:55:28,398
You can see that.

1261
01:55:31,261 --> 01:55:33,082
Motion to approve with our conditions.

1262
01:55:34,203 --> 01:55:34,503
Thank you.

1263
01:55:34,523 --> 01:55:35,084
Do I hear a second?

1264
01:55:36,024 --> 01:55:36,405
Second.

1265
01:55:37,786 --> 01:55:38,626
Alicia DeHunt, vote?

1266
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:39,567
Yes.

1267
01:55:40,488 --> 01:55:40,908
Paul Mulkey?

1268
01:55:41,449 --> 01:55:41,649
Yes.

1269
01:55:42,610 --> 01:55:43,230
Mary Ann O'Connor?

1270
01:55:43,730 --> 01:55:43,991
Yes.

1271
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:45,312
Tim McGibbon?

1272
01:55:45,452 --> 01:55:45,652
Yes.

1273
01:55:48,794 --> 01:55:52,818
Moving to application number 820 Winchester Street.

1274
01:55:53,935 --> 01:55:55,535
Poll ID 671.

1275
01:55:56,615 --> 01:55:59,496
Poll is actually in the Wareham Street right of way, it's in the corner.

1276
01:56:02,556 --> 01:56:10,358
In my review of this one, within 20 feet of one three-story residence, and one more is within 50 feet.

1277
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:23,080
That one looks familiar.

1278
01:56:24,428 --> 01:56:26,370
671, yeah, that's 671, so that's the pole there.

1279
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:30,473
So again, that's another new pole.

1280
01:56:30,493 --> 01:56:32,594
A lot of these are new poles, so.

1281
01:56:35,997 --> 01:56:40,200
Again, can I ask if it's above the residence, what the height could be?

1282
01:56:46,424 --> 01:56:52,048
The height on their proposal says the existing top of the pole is at 29 feet.

1283
01:56:53,591 --> 01:56:58,214
and that they're proposing the base of their equipment starts at 34 feet.

1284
01:56:58,234 --> 01:57:06,840
So they're installing a new pole that's five feet higher than the one that's currently there.

1285
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:13,564
If I can back it up a bit so people can get.

1286
01:57:21,289 --> 01:57:21,809
Oh, doing that.

1287
01:57:25,713 --> 01:57:28,595
at it, it'll go higher than the existing.

1288
01:57:28,615 --> 01:57:36,601
So we can see that it's currently above the houses and it's gonna go five feet higher than it currently is.

1289
01:57:39,983 --> 01:57:40,384
Thank you.

1290
01:57:40,724 --> 01:57:44,106
It'll be significantly above the current house there.

1291
01:57:44,126 --> 01:57:51,512
Okay, and I don't see anything in the chat for 20 Winchester Street.

1292
01:57:51,552 --> 01:57:52,432
Do we have anything in email?

1293
01:57:53,765 --> 01:57:57,267
Nothing in the email, Mr. Chairman, and Councilor Marks has indicated he has the additional comment.

1294
01:57:59,828 --> 01:58:05,370
Okay, Councilor Marks, if you can be brief, that would be appreciated.

1295
01:58:05,390 --> 01:58:08,631
I'll let you speak, please.

1296
01:58:09,972 --> 01:58:10,712
Unmute Councilor Marks.

1297
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:12,181
Thank you, Tim.

1298
01:58:13,482 --> 01:58:18,786
I requested about 20 minutes ago that we allow people that have their hands raised to speak.

1299
01:58:19,587 --> 01:58:21,068
And you agreed with that.

1300
01:58:21,628 --> 01:58:25,751
And then a representative from Verizon came on and said they heard enough public input.

1301
01:58:26,332 --> 01:58:28,073
And then you sided with Verizon.

1302
01:58:28,393 --> 01:58:32,617
I'm a little disappointed that- I sided with myself.

1303
01:58:32,797 --> 01:58:37,080
I mean, I do want to let these people speak and I am going to.

1304
01:58:38,196 --> 01:58:40,877
Give them two minutes each, there's five of them, that's 10 minutes.

1305
01:58:41,837 --> 01:58:44,837
It doesn't make sense to go through all these petitions.

1306
01:58:45,418 --> 01:58:47,198
Let the people speak that want to speak.

1307
01:58:49,778 --> 01:58:50,059
Thank you.

1308
01:58:51,859 --> 01:58:56,060
Just so everybody knows, I mean, there's a lot on the agenda, so I'm trying to keep it moving.

1309
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:59,581
But I do want to let people speak.

1310
01:59:00,721 --> 01:59:03,541
So if we can be quick here, please.

1311
01:59:03,902 --> 01:59:05,782
I do want to respect folks

1312
01:59:07,069 --> 01:59:08,609
make sure that folks have a chance to speak.

1313
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:23,733
So let's go to Mr. Lysakowski, if I'm saying that correctly.

1314
01:59:23,773 --> 01:59:25,834
We can't hear you, Mr. Lysakowski.

1315
01:59:26,434 --> 01:59:27,254
You are unmuted though.

1316
01:59:38,997 --> 01:59:41,417
All right, well, I think, I believe we may have lost him.

1317
01:59:42,238 --> 01:59:44,198
Mr. LaScalcia, if he comes back, just let me know.

1318
01:59:44,298 --> 01:59:46,938
And if you have general comments, you can send them to the next one.

1319
01:59:47,798 --> 01:59:50,259
Mr. Brandes, we'll unmute you.

1320
01:59:50,279 --> 01:59:52,159
Please try to keep it brief.

1321
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:01,601
Hi, my name is Aaron Brandes.

1322
02:00:01,701 --> 02:00:05,601
My address is 48 Marion Street.

1323
02:00:06,942 --> 02:00:08,402
And I have a,

1324
02:00:10,528 --> 02:00:13,029
One, I have two questions, I guess.

1325
02:00:13,249 --> 02:00:28,593
One is, it's been my impression that Verizon was having work done at their behest or in some way on many of the designated polls.

1326
02:00:28,713 --> 02:00:30,734
And I'm wondering if that's true.

1327
02:00:32,334 --> 02:00:35,055
And secondly, the committee

1328
02:00:36,233 --> 02:00:48,196
keeps talking about how their hands are tied and how, but aren't you the people who were supposed to, who wrote the conditions that applications had to meet?

1329
02:00:48,737 --> 02:00:50,777
Can you clarify who wrote them?

1330
02:00:50,897 --> 02:01:02,420
And also during this, there seemed to be a lot of other towns that are adding more conditions to protect their citizens.

1331
02:01:02,881 --> 02:01:03,841
And I'm wondering if,

1332
02:01:04,734 --> 02:01:08,396
if you've had any contact with other cities about this.

1333
02:01:10,036 --> 02:01:10,377
Thank you.

1334
02:01:13,358 --> 02:01:13,918
Thank you very much.

1335
02:01:13,938 --> 02:01:19,881
You can let the committee members speak to their experience.

1336
02:01:20,661 --> 02:01:23,462
I've been talking to quite a number of folks regarding this.

1337
02:01:25,663 --> 02:01:29,705
The policies and ordinances that other towns are operating under are different from ours.

1338
02:01:30,355 --> 02:01:38,157
The policy that we have in place, the interim policy was written by the previous mayor's administration and is the one we're operating under today.

1339
02:01:41,058 --> 02:01:47,120
All right, Tim, I think I can add a little bit if you want to indulge me just on, in terms of background, in terms of the poll work.

1340
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:49,101
Tim is correct.

1341
02:01:49,141 --> 02:01:54,723
And just to clarify his point, this was a policy that was developed in 2019 under the Burke administration.

1342
02:01:54,803 --> 02:01:58,564
These are applications that were submitted in 2019 under the Burke administration.

1343
02:01:59,264 --> 02:02:02,706
And these are, we sought advice of counsel over the past year.

1344
02:02:03,447 --> 02:02:10,751
Mayor Lungo Kern sought to delay this as fervently as she could, and Verizon can speak to that.

1345
02:02:10,771 --> 02:02:21,196
Some of the conversations that she had with them via email trying to push these out and delay these and find more time and advocate at the federal level to the greatest extent she could.

1346
02:02:23,464 --> 02:02:26,846
This is, what Tim said, an unfortunate situation.

1347
02:02:27,726 --> 02:02:33,869
Speaking specifically to the poll work that was done by Verizon, it was brought to our attention that poll work was being performed.

1348
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:39,072
Verizon was put on notice that any work performed prior to this hearing was done at their own risk.

1349
02:02:39,732 --> 02:02:44,755
If they were doing it in advance of this hearing, before these permits were issued, and the permits were not issued,

1350
02:02:45,515 --> 02:02:45,956
They're out.

1351
02:02:46,596 --> 02:02:48,839
They're doing so at their own risk.

1352
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:54,284
Speaking to an earlier point about the federal advocacy, it is a point extremely well taken.

1353
02:02:54,504 --> 02:02:56,567
And the mayor and I have spoken about this a number of times.

1354
02:02:57,107 --> 02:03:04,535
And we are preparing our advocacy strategy to the federal government now so that we can advocate to both Senator Warren, Senator Markey,

1355
02:03:04,908 --> 02:03:15,850
Congresswoman Clark, the FCC, the White House, anybody that will listen to us, we're gonna talk to about these issues, because she is extremely concerned about the removal of local control over the placement of these things.

1356
02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:31,353
That's what we mean when, I think, and I'm not gonna put words inside Tim's mouth, but when we say our hands are tied, it wasn't tied by us, by anyone on this call, and anyone that's currently in city government, or currently that probably has ever even been to Medford.

1357
02:03:32,113 --> 02:03:34,374
which is the most frustrating part for all of us.

1358
02:03:35,115 --> 02:03:41,878
I've spoken to all four members individually about their frustrations, my frustrations, the mayor's frustrations, and they're working through them.

1359
02:03:41,958 --> 02:03:44,519
So those are just a couple of brief points on that stuff.

1360
02:03:44,539 --> 02:03:45,259
I hope it was helpful.

1361
02:03:45,479 --> 02:03:47,620
So I'm available for any other questions.

1362
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:48,381
I appreciate that.

1363
02:03:48,421 --> 02:03:50,121
And what's your position?

1364
02:03:51,382 --> 02:03:53,283
Do you have a position in the city government?

1365
02:03:53,869 --> 02:03:55,610
I'm the chief of staff for this video.

1366
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:56,030
You're what?

1367
02:03:56,150 --> 02:03:57,451
I'm the mayor's chief of staff.

1368
02:03:57,932 --> 02:03:58,572
Chief of staff.

1369
02:03:58,652 --> 02:03:59,413
Thank you very much.

1370
02:03:59,673 --> 02:04:04,175
I really appreciate getting some direct responses.

1371
02:04:04,236 --> 02:04:04,616
Thank you.

1372
02:04:05,176 --> 02:04:06,477
Thank you very much, Mr. Berenice.

1373
02:04:06,537 --> 02:04:08,398
If you could do me a favor and take your hand down.

1374
02:04:08,698 --> 02:04:11,040
Folks, if you have spoken, please take your hand down.

1375
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:19,345
I will move on to the next location, but Mr. George, I assume a man, George Silvestro, Marilyn Jordan, and Barbara Kendall.

1376
02:04:20,653 --> 02:04:22,433
I believe Barbara may have a site-specific one.

1377
02:04:22,874 --> 02:04:24,174
I've spoken to Barbara.

1378
02:04:25,654 --> 02:04:30,615
So we'll do it that way, because I do want to let people speak.

1379
02:04:30,675 --> 02:04:33,675
That is part of this, as has been said.

1380
02:04:34,195 --> 02:04:36,736
I'm unmuting Mr. Silvestro.

1381
02:04:38,516 --> 02:04:38,596
OK.

1382
02:04:38,636 --> 02:04:42,097
I wanted to do that in the next one.

1383
02:04:42,117 --> 02:04:42,337
That's OK.

1384
02:04:42,357 --> 02:04:42,837
Oh, sorry.

1385
02:04:43,457 --> 02:04:43,877
That's OK.

1386
02:04:44,277 --> 02:04:45,477
I believe it's a general comment.

1387
02:04:47,198 --> 02:04:47,658
Do we have any?

1388
02:04:49,007 --> 02:04:50,528
Let's see, I just kind of lost my place.

1389
02:04:50,588 --> 02:04:57,434
I believe we're on 20 Winchester Street, 671 and application number eight.

1390
02:04:57,454 --> 02:04:59,316
So 20 Winchester Street.

1391
02:05:00,136 --> 02:05:03,459
So do we have any emails on 20 Winchester Street?

1392
02:05:03,779 --> 02:05:06,682
I don't believe I saw any in the comments in the chat.

1393
02:05:08,503 --> 02:05:09,644
There are no emails, Mr. Chairman.

1394
02:05:10,184 --> 02:05:10,885
Okay, thank you.

1395
02:05:10,905 --> 02:05:13,187
All right.

1396
02:05:20,003 --> 02:05:29,086
All right, thank you everybody for your general comments, but it's making it more difficult for me to get the specific ones.

1397
02:05:29,726 --> 02:05:33,327
Okay, I don't see anything in the chat for 21 Chester Street.

1398
02:05:35,708 --> 02:05:37,829
And that's, do we have that one on the screen?

1399
02:05:41,435 --> 02:05:42,015
This will wear him.

1400
02:05:42,095 --> 02:05:47,676
Yes, that's my belief that that's, we're looking at it from a distance to see its comparison to the building.

1401
02:05:48,217 --> 02:05:48,877
Thank you, thank you.

1402
02:05:48,937 --> 02:05:49,937
All right, I'm on track now.

1403
02:05:49,957 --> 02:05:51,137
Yeah, we did, we did do that.

1404
02:05:51,197 --> 02:05:52,618
Okay, so we're ready for a motion.

1405
02:05:57,459 --> 02:06:01,840
At the- Motion to approve 20 Winchester Street with our standard conditions.

1406
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:04,000
Right, do we hear a second?

1407
02:06:05,481 --> 02:06:06,521
I'll second that motion.

1408
02:06:06,541 --> 02:06:09,702
Okay, and we'll vote.

1409
02:06:09,922 --> 02:06:10,382
Alicia Hunt?

1410
02:06:12,502 --> 02:06:13,002
Paul Moki?

1411
02:06:13,743 --> 02:06:14,003
Yes.

1412
02:06:15,124 --> 02:06:15,904
Mary Ann O'Connor?

1413
02:06:17,005 --> 02:06:17,285
Yes.

1414
02:06:17,305 --> 02:06:18,806
Okay, it's approved.

1415
02:06:18,826 --> 02:06:20,367
Conditions.

1416
02:06:21,587 --> 02:06:25,890
All right, next one is application number nine for Colby Street, poll 4435.

1417
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:33,615
And I do know that somebody wanted to speak on poll for Colby Street.

1418
02:06:33,735 --> 02:06:39,338
I believe it was a gentleman who spoke a couple of times back, so we can get him back on.

1419
02:06:39,778 --> 02:06:40,739
Yeah, Mr. Nazaro.

1420
02:06:41,533 --> 02:06:51,438
Yeah, but before we do that, my review, there wasn't any three story residences within 60 feet, and it's at the corner of the Tufts Science Building on Colby.

1421
02:06:53,239 --> 02:06:57,921
So with that, we'll go to site specific comments, anything in the email, just check that first.

1422
02:07:01,987 --> 02:07:03,947
Uh, there were a number of emails received, Mr Chairman.

1423
02:07:04,548 --> 02:07:07,548
I'll read them and, uh, several.

1424
02:07:07,768 --> 02:07:10,569
I'll read them chronological or as they were received on.

1425
02:07:10,609 --> 02:07:13,249
I apologize if I, um, mispronounce anybody's name.

1426
02:07:13,909 --> 02:07:25,872
Sharon Sue, uh, an application regarding concerning about, um, additional studies definitively proving the safety of small cells in that application nine is adjacent to her house with young Children.

1427
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,142
she's concerned about the constant exposure.

1428
02:07:30,263 --> 02:07:33,025
She did send two emails to that general effect.

1429
02:07:34,987 --> 02:07:41,652
Another email was received from Sharon Wong, additional scientific studies regarding young children at home all day.

1430
02:07:41,672 --> 02:07:47,336
I'm not sure if this is the same individual based upon the context of the email.

1431
02:07:47,936 --> 02:07:48,537
Mr. Nazaro,

1432
02:07:49,059 --> 02:07:55,617
also emailed a number of times regarding his property in 9698 Princeton opposite the pole.

1433
02:07:57,817 --> 02:08:01,620
And he stated that he was well-served by the legacy service of 3G and 4G.

1434
02:08:02,261 --> 02:08:07,765
And he had some comments regarding some of the other comments that were made previously.

1435
02:08:07,785 --> 02:08:16,852
He stated that 440 scientists have now signed the 5G appeal and he had serious health concerns related to 5G.

1436
02:08:17,352 --> 02:08:21,035
And restated that the health of the community is the most basic protection.

1437
02:08:21,055 --> 02:08:25,139
The final email was again from Mr. Nazaro.

1438
02:08:26,361 --> 02:08:29,323
Um, concerned about the, uh, placement.

1439
02:08:29,943 --> 02:08:35,786
Uh, that was, that was there in the structural, the structural integrity of poll 365 outside of for Colby.

1440
02:08:36,226 --> 02:08:37,187
That's the extent of the email.

1441
02:08:39,048 --> 02:08:39,648
And I did get it.

1442
02:08:39,668 --> 02:08:45,811
There was a confirmation in the chat, uh, that emails, uh, from Sharon Sue and Sharon Wong, uh, were from the same individual.

1443
02:08:46,952 --> 02:08:47,132
Okay.

1444
02:08:49,752 --> 02:08:53,154
So that pole is one that will be replaced.

1445
02:08:53,214 --> 02:09:05,203
The existing pole, according to the application, is the top of it is 33 and a half feet high, and the new top of pole would be 38 and a half feet high.

1446
02:09:05,283 --> 02:09:16,951
So it'll be five feet taller than the existing pole, which looks like it's gonna, again, put it significantly above the other houses.

1447
02:09:17,625 --> 02:09:23,466
and would address any instability issues of the existing poll, because it will be a new one.

1448
02:09:23,486 --> 02:09:34,428
And does Mr., blanking on his name, the gentleman that wrote an email and said he wanted to speak on Colby, does he want to?

1449
02:09:34,448 --> 02:09:37,869
Yeah, has he made his point?

1450
02:09:37,889 --> 02:09:39,990
Would you like to speak?

1451
02:09:40,350 --> 02:09:40,670
Yes.

1452
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:42,250
Okay, hello.

1453
02:09:44,895 --> 02:09:48,976
I don't understand why there are no setbacks for the playing fields.

1454
02:09:49,596 --> 02:09:54,357
People in their houses won't be exposed to the millimeter wave radiation.

1455
02:09:54,937 --> 02:09:56,698
People out in the street will be.

1456
02:09:57,478 --> 02:10:01,939
The pole, I thought, was at the other end of the building where the door opens.

1457
02:10:01,999 --> 02:10:06,360
That's for Colby Street, but it's the far end of the building by the playing fields.

1458
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:11,883
One end of the building, the kids stand out there and smoke, so they'll be irradiated.

1459
02:10:12,404 --> 02:10:18,608
The other end of that street, the kids are out there in the playing fields, so they'll be irradiated.

1460
02:10:18,628 --> 02:10:31,117
And there's no protection for children in playing fields and playgrounds with your bylaw or ordinance or whatever you call it, which to me seems very negligent.

1461
02:10:32,751 --> 02:10:34,792
That poll, by the way, is a new poll.

1462
02:10:35,512 --> 02:10:38,633
I was wrong with my original identification of the poll.

1463
02:10:39,774 --> 02:10:40,514
It's a new poll.

1464
02:10:40,534 --> 02:10:42,195
So if they're going to change the new poll, that's fine.

1465
02:10:42,215 --> 02:10:45,956
There is no concrete in the sidewalk around the new poll.

1466
02:10:50,058 --> 02:10:50,358
Thank you.

1467
02:10:50,478 --> 02:10:55,700
And most of your concerns are health-related, and I'm afraid the policy doesn't have the setbacks to find.

1468
02:10:57,241 --> 02:10:57,701
Why not?

1469
02:10:58,482 --> 02:10:59,962
I do not know why not.

1470
02:11:00,742 --> 02:11:01,783
But that's negligent.

1471
02:11:03,531 --> 02:11:08,535
We're talking about the health of our children and the students and the people that send their kids to Medford to go to college.

1472
02:11:11,697 --> 02:11:14,479
Again, that's a federal... No, it isn't.

1473
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:17,061
That's a town ordinance or bylaw.

1474
02:11:17,101 --> 02:11:18,402
It's nothing to do with the feds.

1475
02:11:18,423 --> 02:11:19,543
You can institute it.

1476
02:11:19,844 --> 02:11:20,584
You did not.

1477
02:11:20,624 --> 02:11:22,045
You're not protecting the public.

1478
02:11:22,586 --> 02:11:26,669
This body does not have the ability to set policy.

1479
02:11:27,345 --> 02:11:31,587
that is not given to us in the policy.

1480
02:11:32,887 --> 02:11:35,229
Mr. Nazaro, please.

1481
02:11:36,349 --> 02:11:44,513
This topic has been covered at length both today and last hearing, and many people have spoke eloquently on it.

1482
02:11:44,973 --> 02:11:46,513
I think I agree with you, actually.

1483
02:11:47,934 --> 02:11:54,137
So, that said, thank you very much.

1484
02:11:56,893 --> 02:11:58,134
Thank you for getting your comments on the record.

1485
02:11:58,934 --> 02:11:59,195
All right.

1486
02:12:01,256 --> 02:12:03,658
So we have 4 Colby Street on the table.

1487
02:12:03,678 --> 02:12:06,740
Do we have a motion?

1488
02:12:10,042 --> 02:12:13,745
Motion to approve 4 Colby Street with the conditions we adopted.

1489
02:12:15,606 --> 02:12:16,166
Do we have a second?

1490
02:12:16,186 --> 02:12:21,330
Seconded.

1491
02:12:23,331 --> 02:12:24,152
Was that a second, Alicia?

1492
02:12:24,892 --> 02:12:25,473
Yes, sorry.

1493
02:12:25,985 --> 02:12:27,626
Okay, that's okay, just cut out for a sec.

1494
02:12:28,186 --> 02:12:29,466
All right, so we'll go to the vote.

1495
02:12:29,546 --> 02:12:31,007
Alicia Hunt, Alicia Hunt?

1496
02:12:31,887 --> 02:12:32,027
Yeah.

1497
02:12:32,047 --> 02:12:32,467
Paul Mookie?

1498
02:12:33,428 --> 02:12:33,728
Yes.

1499
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,368
Mary Ann O'Connor?

1500
02:12:37,989 --> 02:12:41,330
Yeah, my understanding is this poll's 38 feet high, so yes.

1501
02:12:41,971 --> 02:12:44,852
Okay, and I'm a yes as well.

1502
02:12:46,792 --> 02:12:53,815
And I'll take this opportunity to let the next person who had general comments in a couple minutes, George Silvestro, if we could unmute him.

1503
02:12:58,686 --> 02:13:01,027
and we'll move on to 333 Main Street.

1504
02:13:02,789 --> 02:13:03,109
Hello.

1505
02:13:04,450 --> 02:13:05,530
Hello, Mr. Silvestro, thank you.

1506
02:13:06,211 --> 02:13:07,111
You're welcome, thank you.

1507
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:11,354
George Silvestro, 45 Brogan Road.

1508
02:13:11,374 --> 02:13:12,194
Thank you.

1509
02:13:14,416 --> 02:13:17,077
I had a comment on Granville Ave.

1510
02:13:17,097 --> 02:13:18,118
Okay.

1511
02:13:19,319 --> 02:13:23,521
That the gentleman that spoke saying the polls were numbered wrong, he is absolutely correct.

1512
02:13:27,083 --> 02:13:27,224
And

1513
02:13:28,615 --> 02:13:39,820
I object to that poll too, because I have two houses on the corner of Winchester street and Martin Ave that they get overlapped from different towers, from different polls that you're putting up.

1514
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:53,146
So does that mean I'm getting double of the, whatever's coming out of these polls when they're overlapped on the maps that they have, they're overlapped.

1515
02:13:56,188 --> 02:13:56,988
My other question.

1516
02:13:58,554 --> 02:14:01,516
on the pole in front of my house at 45 Brogan Road.

1517
02:14:04,419 --> 02:14:09,703
The reason they put it in front of my house, because there was four other poles on Park Street.

1518
02:14:12,345 --> 02:14:13,766
We will get to that one.

1519
02:14:14,867 --> 02:14:16,188
I have some comments on that one as well.

1520
02:14:16,709 --> 02:14:21,052
I did stop by and confirm some of the numbers that you said.

1521
02:14:21,172 --> 02:14:24,635
It refers to the Granville Ave on Park Street.

1522
02:14:25,522 --> 02:14:29,784
Poll number 222, 2213, there's two of them.

1523
02:14:30,325 --> 02:14:30,885
Same number.

1524
02:14:31,145 --> 02:14:31,845
Same number.

1525
02:14:35,147 --> 02:14:42,991
The 48 Granville Ave poll number is 30, and it's the one, it's the only one on the dead end portion of Granville Ave.

1526
02:14:43,071 --> 02:14:44,212
Yes, I understand that.

1527
02:14:44,792 --> 02:14:45,513
Okay, okay.

1528
02:14:45,913 --> 02:14:51,596
The reason I'm saying on Park Street, there's two polls with the same number.

1529
02:14:53,337 --> 02:14:53,517
Okay.

1530
02:14:55,025 --> 02:14:55,105
of 22, 13.

1531
02:14:57,687 --> 02:15:08,153
And then it's just a shame that you guys inherited this mess and you guys can't do nothing about it.

1532
02:15:09,912 --> 02:15:12,294
I agree, we're gonna get to the poll in front of your house, Mr. Smith.

1533
02:15:12,334 --> 02:15:14,676
No, but I wanna voice my opinion.

1534
02:15:14,696 --> 02:15:16,798
I've been on here since six o'clock with you guys.

1535
02:15:17,198 --> 02:15:17,738
I know, I know.

1536
02:15:18,179 --> 02:15:20,080
I do not have the right to speak.

1537
02:15:20,641 --> 02:15:22,903
I pay the taxes, that pays your salary.

1538
02:15:23,263 --> 02:15:24,064
Yep.

1539
02:15:24,084 --> 02:15:25,485
We all identify ourselves.

1540
02:15:25,965 --> 02:15:28,387
Can you guys identify yourself with your zip code?

1541
02:15:29,628 --> 02:15:30,689
I live in Manfred.

1542
02:15:31,049 --> 02:15:32,651
I'll wait for 45 Brogan Road.

1543
02:15:33,227 --> 02:15:45,952
Okay, I live in Medford, so everybody knows, I live in Medford, I'm a resident, and I'm trying to let people speak and get their opinions, and this is the first time, and I checked out your inquiry, personally, so.

1544
02:15:47,113 --> 02:15:55,256
All right, so we're gonna move on to three, if you could take your hand down too, that will be helpful, and- I'm gonna wait for 45 Brogan Road.

1545
02:15:55,556 --> 02:15:57,697
Oh, okay, okay, yeah, I'll get you, I know you're there.

1546
02:15:57,717 --> 02:15:58,438
Thank you.

1547
02:15:58,518 --> 02:16:00,458
Yeah, all right, so 333 Main Street,

1548
02:16:02,647 --> 02:16:04,568
Application 35, pole 2188.

1549
02:16:04,708 --> 02:16:08,190
The closest residential building is 50 feet away.

1550
02:16:08,210 --> 02:16:10,391
That's the third story.

1551
02:16:10,411 --> 02:16:11,852
You could go to that one.

1552
02:16:11,872 --> 02:16:12,932
That's the next one.

1553
02:16:14,353 --> 02:16:18,875
And if we could check emails to see if we have any emails that came in on 333 Main Street.

1554
02:16:19,636 --> 02:16:20,836
No emails received for 333 Main.

1555
02:16:20,936 --> 02:16:21,597
Okay.

1556
02:16:23,197 --> 02:16:32,222
And the existing top of the pole is 29 feet, 10 inches, and their equipment is slated to go on a new pole

1557
02:16:32,829 --> 02:16:37,409
starting at 34 feet, so five feet above the existing location.

1558
02:16:39,926 --> 02:16:42,748
I do have to ask again, otherwise I have to turn off the chat.

1559
02:16:42,788 --> 02:16:44,829
There's a lot of general comments coming in from the chat.

1560
02:16:44,869 --> 02:16:46,270
I'm reading them, I acknowledge them.

1561
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:51,032
A lot of them, you know, we could spend all night talking about them.

1562
02:16:51,072 --> 02:16:54,734
And we did spend most of all of last meeting discussing them.

1563
02:16:55,515 --> 02:16:57,576
And I'm afraid, you know, it's true.

1564
02:16:57,676 --> 02:16:59,457
We don't have a lot of purview here.

1565
02:16:59,617 --> 02:17:01,398
So I just need to keep reminding folks of that.

1566
02:17:02,238 --> 02:17:03,419
So sorry, Alicia, I interrupted.

1567
02:17:07,303 --> 02:17:09,305
So there we got 3-3 Main Street, Medford Mast.

1568
02:17:14,989 --> 02:17:21,675
And I have to say it, I've studied electricity and electrical engineering and how some of this stuff works.

1569
02:17:22,455 --> 02:17:27,379
And the dangerous space is about a foot or two from the box.

1570
02:17:29,481 --> 02:17:31,483
It doesn't irradiate people on the ground.

1571
02:17:32,753 --> 02:17:33,954
That's not how this works.

1572
02:17:34,534 --> 02:17:44,239
And people need to stop believing the hype that's out there trying to scare Americans away from very useful technology.

1573
02:17:44,259 --> 02:17:46,220
Yeah.

1574
02:17:48,401 --> 02:17:48,861
Thank you.

1575
02:17:48,881 --> 02:17:49,221
Crazy.

1576
02:17:49,861 --> 02:17:50,041
Yeah.

1577
02:17:50,602 --> 02:17:53,603
It's there's been a lot of that still coming in.

1578
02:17:53,723 --> 02:17:56,405
And please, personal attacks to me.

1579
02:17:56,945 --> 02:17:57,525
Please stop.

1580
02:17:58,165 --> 02:17:58,426
OK.

1581
02:17:58,566 --> 02:17:58,986
On the chat.

1582
02:17:59,726 --> 02:18:00,326
Not going to have it.

1583
02:18:00,567 --> 02:18:01,307
I do live in Medford.

1584
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:03,012
I'm not going to have that.

1585
02:18:04,593 --> 02:18:13,296
And I've put a lot of thought into this, and I've constructed an opinion that I believe puts the residents of Medford at the forefront.

1586
02:18:15,557 --> 02:18:15,857
Thank you.

1587
02:18:16,877 --> 02:18:17,697
All right.

1588
02:18:21,459 --> 02:18:26,761
Mr. Lysakowski indicates that 330 Main Street is in direct line of sight for his third floor tenants.

1589
02:18:32,550 --> 02:18:34,372
I am trying to.

1590
02:18:36,313 --> 02:18:41,598
This is 333 Main Street, as is marked on our map I was trying to get the ground floor.

1591
02:18:41,618 --> 02:18:44,801
Okay, so it's a cross from Main Street variety.

1592
02:18:47,223 --> 02:18:48,905
So it's this one.

1593
02:18:51,387 --> 02:18:51,547
Yeah.

1594
02:18:54,267 --> 02:18:56,327
All right, so.

1595
02:18:56,808 --> 02:19:04,169
That pole that you can see there up above the house, is it 29 feet 10 inches according to this survey?

1596
02:19:04,869 --> 02:19:06,769
And they're going to 34 feet.

1597
02:19:10,230 --> 02:19:15,831
And Mr. Lysakowski would like to speak on this one.

1598
02:19:15,851 --> 02:19:17,771
Mr. Lysakowski,

1599
02:19:21,923 --> 02:19:23,504
We can have you speak.

1600
02:19:31,249 --> 02:19:33,731
Maybe, I don't know if one's going to be put in front of my house.

1601
02:19:34,031 --> 02:19:35,292
People have to stop with the comments.

1602
02:19:35,372 --> 02:19:35,512
OK.

1603
02:19:35,532 --> 02:19:38,554
All right.

1604
02:19:38,954 --> 02:19:40,055
I'm going to set it.

1605
02:19:41,475 --> 02:19:41,796
Hello?

1606
02:19:42,276 --> 02:19:42,696
Can you hear me?

1607
02:19:43,517 --> 02:19:44,317
Yes.

1608
02:19:44,718 --> 02:19:45,058
Thank you.

1609
02:19:46,979 --> 02:19:47,239
OK.

1610
02:19:47,639 --> 02:19:51,522
So my issue, and I have some questions for Congressman Marks as well.

1611
02:19:53,650 --> 02:20:01,933
So this is being treated like a done deal, a fait accompli by the committee and by Verizon.

1612
02:20:03,213 --> 02:20:18,057
And I'm wondering, besides health concerns, what other mechanisms do we have as citizens and homeowners, such as ordinances, referendum, amendments,

1613
02:20:18,793 --> 02:20:20,114
Change in city policy.

1614
02:20:20,134 --> 02:20:23,656
What other mechanisms do we have besides health concerns?

1615
02:20:24,476 --> 02:20:43,126
Yes, deny these applications And I want a meeting to talk about those things before we proceed with talking about implementation details because Horizon wants you to rush to talk about implementation details because that means it's a done deal so

1616
02:20:45,449 --> 02:20:49,393
We have a finite purview to review these based off the policy.

1617
02:20:49,413 --> 02:20:52,536
And so that's what we're doing.

1618
02:20:53,096 --> 02:20:58,181
And what is preventing you from expanding your purview as residents and property owners?

1619
02:21:00,510 --> 02:21:03,271
I don't, we don't have the authority to expand our purview.

1620
02:21:04,212 --> 02:21:07,133
Also, when it regards to what you could do as a citizen.

1621
02:21:07,153 --> 02:21:07,954
You took away your power.

1622
02:21:08,934 --> 02:21:15,618
Basically, as a citizen, you can contact, I encourage everybody to contact their federal representatives.

1623
02:21:15,778 --> 02:21:16,138
Okay.

1624
02:21:16,459 --> 02:21:20,601
Well, we need to start local, because this is a local matter.

1625
02:21:21,201 --> 02:21:24,763
To be quite honest, this could have been created as an ordinance over a year ago.

1626
02:21:25,164 --> 02:21:27,565
Okay, what's stopping us from doing that now?

1627
02:21:28,158 --> 02:21:29,138
I don't believe there is anything.

1628
02:21:30,179 --> 02:21:31,459
Okay, do that for us.

1629
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:33,300
City Council rights ordinance.

1630
02:21:33,981 --> 02:21:34,661
City Council.

1631
02:21:34,841 --> 02:21:35,321
Okay.

1632
02:21:35,541 --> 02:21:36,142
Yep.

1633
02:21:36,322 --> 02:21:39,783
What do we have to do to get that on the next city council meeting agenda?

1634
02:21:39,883 --> 02:21:40,984
I'm not on city council.

1635
02:21:41,264 --> 02:21:43,385
I and I would encourage that please.

1636
02:21:45,826 --> 02:21:47,967
I can I can tell you to contact the clerk's office.

1637
02:21:50,028 --> 02:21:50,608
City Council.

1638
02:21:51,568 --> 02:21:53,449
President caraviello is the current president.

1639
02:21:54,009 --> 02:21:55,370
Okay, he's in this meeting now.

1640
02:21:57,021 --> 02:21:58,021
Is he still present?

1641
02:21:59,102 --> 02:22:02,163
It was on their agenda last Tuesday.

1642
02:22:02,303 --> 02:22:04,663
And from the sounds of it, it's going to be on the agenda again.

1643
02:22:05,244 --> 02:22:05,764
OK.

1644
02:22:06,704 --> 02:22:07,644
So is he present now?

1645
02:22:08,945 --> 02:22:10,005
He was present early in the meeting.

1646
02:22:10,025 --> 02:22:10,945
I don't know if he's present now.

1647
02:22:10,965 --> 02:22:11,205
OK.

1648
02:22:11,245 --> 02:22:12,766
Could we check and see if he's here now?

1649
02:22:13,946 --> 02:22:17,127
Let's get this scheduled on their calendar tonight.

1650
02:22:17,147 --> 02:22:19,868
The meeting is supposed to be over at 830.

1651
02:22:20,468 --> 02:22:22,229
We all have other things to do.

1652
02:22:22,909 --> 02:22:24,490
This is why I'm trying to keep it moving.

1653
02:22:24,510 --> 02:22:25,730
I'm trying to keep it moving.

1654
02:22:26,432 --> 02:22:27,432
I'm trying to keep moving.

1655
02:22:27,913 --> 02:22:31,454
Okay, well, you have to hear from your constituents.

1656
02:22:32,894 --> 02:22:34,155
I'm not an elected official.

1657
02:22:34,715 --> 02:22:36,156
But I do want to hear from people.

1658
02:22:36,876 --> 02:22:39,237
I, I'm not elected official, but I want to hear from people.

1659
02:22:39,377 --> 02:22:45,959
So and I have a substantial amount of time listening to general comments of the city council here.

1660
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:49,761
I'm not aware if he's here right now.

1661
02:22:50,401 --> 02:22:51,601
But we are going to look in the

1662
02:22:53,327 --> 02:22:54,108
We are going to move on.

1663
02:22:54,148 --> 02:22:55,248
Thank you very much, Mr. Leslie.

1664
02:22:55,308 --> 02:22:56,609
Wait a minute.

1665
02:22:56,649 --> 02:22:57,350
Wait, hold on.

1666
02:22:57,590 --> 02:22:58,130
Hold on.

1667
02:22:59,111 --> 02:23:03,614
I live within 300 feet of that 333 Main Street.

1668
02:23:04,155 --> 02:23:07,257
It is direct line of sight, direct line of transmission.

1669
02:23:07,537 --> 02:23:10,439
We are going to see if President Carabiello is here.

1670
02:23:10,459 --> 02:23:11,860
We're going to do that.

1671
02:23:12,261 --> 02:23:13,622
And he wanted to speak earlier.

1672
02:23:13,662 --> 02:23:15,163
If he still wants to speak, we're going to let him speak.

1673
02:23:15,903 --> 02:23:16,003
OK.

1674
02:23:16,684 --> 02:23:16,764
OK.

1675
02:23:17,647 --> 02:23:23,490
All right, have the residents of the third floor apartment on 333 Main Street been notified about this?

1676
02:23:23,870 --> 02:23:25,491
Yes, yes.

1677
02:23:26,972 --> 02:23:27,532
Yes, they have.

1678
02:23:27,992 --> 02:23:28,473
Tim?

1679
02:23:29,133 --> 02:23:30,694
Hi, President Caravaglia, thank you very much.

1680
02:23:30,714 --> 02:23:31,154
Thank you.

1681
02:23:31,194 --> 02:23:32,675
Mr. Lykoski, thank you very much.

1682
02:23:33,475 --> 02:23:35,476
Mr. Lykoski, you are correct.

1683
02:23:35,676 --> 02:23:46,982
There were several, this was on our agenda last week, and Councilor Mox posed seven questions to the commission

1684
02:23:47,455 --> 02:23:53,876
along with, I think he made seven motions for this particular project.

1685
02:23:54,636 --> 02:24:04,738
And I said, and I think as Councilor Moxley alluded to earlier, all the committee people should have received a copy of what we discussed on Tuesday evening.

1686
02:24:05,618 --> 02:24:10,739
And I think we were pretty clear and unified in what we sent out.

1687
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:14,420
Okay, what's the ordinance that's being proposed?

1688
02:24:15,253 --> 02:24:16,733
There is no ordinance proposed.

1689
02:24:17,614 --> 02:24:21,535
The city council has never been asked to make an ordinance on this.

1690
02:24:23,415 --> 02:24:25,956
This is policy written by the administration.

1691
02:24:27,416 --> 02:24:30,617
And this goes back a couple of years.

1692
02:24:30,657 --> 02:24:34,658
Can you explain the process to us for proposing the ordinance and carrying it forward?

1693
02:24:35,433 --> 02:24:42,854
this, can we move this conversation to a place where it's more appropriate, such as city council, or?

1694
02:24:42,874 --> 02:24:48,535
Before you rubber stamp all these applications, I wanna make sure- We're not rubber stamping them.

1695
02:24:49,356 --> 02:24:50,136
I have to move on.

1696
02:24:50,156 --> 02:24:51,376
We're not rubber stamping them.

1697
02:24:51,436 --> 02:24:52,676
We're placing conditions.

1698
02:24:52,696 --> 02:24:55,157
Well, you're pushing them through without careful consideration.

1699
02:24:55,277 --> 02:24:55,617
Tim?

1700
02:24:55,877 --> 02:24:57,557
We've been carefully considering this for over a year.

1701
02:24:57,637 --> 02:24:59,497
We've been carefully considering this for over a year.

1702
02:24:59,837 --> 02:25:00,078
Okay.

1703
02:25:00,218 --> 02:25:02,538
Well, then why haven't the ordinance been passed?

1704
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:07,203
City Council had over you to move on this for an ordinance.

1705
02:25:07,583 --> 02:25:16,570
Tim, can I move that we again, move this meeting to continuance.

1706
02:25:16,590 --> 02:25:27,479
This is nine o'clock now, and we're not getting further and the residents are not understanding the position we're in.

1707
02:25:27,919 --> 02:25:30,521
I'm going to, we're going to continue this, we're going to continue this meeting.

1708
02:25:33,663 --> 02:25:36,444
and until we get through some more of these.

1709
02:25:37,805 --> 02:25:42,987
I would like to know why you put yourself in this position to be, to not have- Mr. Lysakowski, please.

1710
02:25:43,767 --> 02:25:50,410
I've said a lot and the topics that you want to talk about should be discussed with City Council.

1711
02:25:50,510 --> 02:25:52,471
Okay, let's talk about 333 Main Street.

1712
02:25:52,851 --> 02:25:52,951
Okay.

1713
02:25:52,971 --> 02:25:54,732
That's your immediate concern?

1714
02:25:55,492 --> 02:25:55,712
Yep.

1715
02:25:56,453 --> 02:25:57,573
So what is your proposal?

1716
02:25:58,969 --> 02:26:04,593
that to place our standard conditions on 333 Main Street, that would be mine.

1717
02:26:06,494 --> 02:26:06,835
Okay.

1718
02:26:07,535 --> 02:26:12,118
My other concern is about the pole in front of Tufts Park, right next to the swimming pool.

1719
02:26:13,459 --> 02:26:14,940
I have a concern with every single one of them.

1720
02:26:15,541 --> 02:26:18,262
Well, I mean, my children play in that park.

1721
02:26:18,943 --> 02:26:19,403
So do mine.

1722
02:26:19,824 --> 02:26:20,504
Use the pool.

1723
02:26:21,285 --> 02:26:21,745
So do mine.

1724
02:26:22,385 --> 02:26:26,648
And, you know, we don't, at this pole at 333 Main Street,

1725
02:26:27,956 --> 02:26:30,857
is going to cause more unrest and interference in my neighborhood.

1726
02:26:30,877 --> 02:26:33,399
All right, thank you very much, Melissa Kosky.

1727
02:26:34,639 --> 02:26:36,440
Can I ask what the height of the pole is, please?

1728
02:26:41,482 --> 02:26:52,328
The application says that the top of the existing utility pole is 29 feet 10 inches and that the proposed top of the utility ball would be 34 feet.

1729
02:26:55,277 --> 02:27:02,320
and it would be at 34 feet that the equipment would start.

1730
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:02,940
33 feet.

1731
02:27:03,580 --> 02:27:11,023
I know that folks are, you know, the Verizon folks are basing this on 20 year old guidance, but that's the guidance we have.

1732
02:27:11,083 --> 02:27:15,565
So 33 feet minimum is the guidance that we're going on.

1733
02:27:15,645 --> 02:27:23,028
So if it's above 33 feet and above that, I'm okay.

1734
02:27:23,829 --> 02:27:30,291
As we're looking at two and a half story houses, those are, they look like three, they're legally two and a half.

1735
02:27:31,391 --> 02:27:39,674
The zoning height regulations in Medford is 35 feet, while obviously there are things that don't comply with zoning.

1736
02:27:40,214 --> 02:27:51,238
When you can see that most of that buildings are the same height, one has to, they're under, these poles are going up around the roof line of the top story.

1737
02:27:53,446 --> 02:27:55,627
All right, do we have a motion for 333 Main Street?

1738
02:27:57,468 --> 02:27:58,429
Motion to approve.

1739
02:27:58,449 --> 02:28:00,350
Do we have a second?

1740
02:28:00,370 --> 02:28:01,611
With our conditions.

1741
02:28:01,631 --> 02:28:03,772
Do we have a second?

1742
02:28:03,792 --> 02:28:06,714
I'll second that too.

1743
02:28:07,294 --> 02:28:08,014
All right, vote.

1744
02:28:08,195 --> 02:28:08,695
Alicia Hunt?

1745
02:28:10,156 --> 02:28:10,416
Yes.

1746
02:28:11,657 --> 02:28:12,097
Paul Moghi?

1747
02:28:13,097 --> 02:28:13,358
Yes.

1748
02:28:14,658 --> 02:28:15,319
Mary Ann O'Connor?

1749
02:28:15,859 --> 02:28:16,119
Yes.

1750
02:28:17,060 --> 02:28:17,740
Tim McGivern, yes.

1751
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:22,223
All right, moving on to 600 Boston Avenue.

1752
02:28:23,341 --> 02:28:24,121
Application 45, poll 4910.

1753
02:28:24,181 --> 02:28:39,386
Mr. Chairman, there have been no site-specific emails received for this location.

1754
02:28:40,246 --> 02:28:40,986
Okay, thank you.

1755
02:28:41,006 --> 02:28:45,448
I didn't see any comment on the chat for 600 Boston Avenue.

1756
02:28:59,352 --> 02:29:00,893
All right, there's one new one, let me just check that.

1757
02:29:04,236 --> 02:29:06,538
A poll could very well go in front of my house, Ms.

1758
02:29:07,458 --> 02:29:08,099
Kuczynski.

1759
02:29:08,139 --> 02:29:11,742
They haven't proposed one, but I would be in the same situation that I am for every single one of these.

1760
02:29:13,583 --> 02:29:14,204
I live in Medford.

1761
02:29:15,805 --> 02:29:20,749
All right, my measurements for 600 Boston Avenue, 58 feet away from St.

1762
02:29:20,789 --> 02:29:25,533
Clement Elementary School, 70 plus feet away from the third story buildings, horizontal plane.

1763
02:29:29,825 --> 02:29:31,626
Any other, any comments from the committee?

1764
02:29:33,768 --> 02:29:35,609
Alicia, can we get a street view of that one?

1765
02:29:38,211 --> 02:29:40,153
It's that one, that asphalt patch, I believe, right there.

1766
02:29:40,173 --> 02:29:44,196
The one right there that looks cut off at the top.

1767
02:29:46,638 --> 02:29:48,359
I don't have the next one open.

1768
02:29:55,764 --> 02:29:56,925
This says,

1769
02:29:59,967 --> 02:30:15,219
Maybe it's just an artifact of what's there, but the proposal here says that the top of the existing and proposed utility pole is 38 foot six inches.

1770
02:30:17,301 --> 02:30:21,104
It just gives the impression of being a lot shorter.

1771
02:30:21,124 --> 02:30:23,385
Yeah, it doesn't look like it's that high.

1772
02:30:24,286 --> 02:30:26,128
Is that the right pole number they have on there?

1773
02:30:27,969 --> 02:30:29,210
Are they replacing it?

1774
02:30:32,965 --> 02:30:36,445
We could have Verizon speak to this specific poll.

1775
02:30:36,725 --> 02:30:38,146
Are we looking at the correct one?

1776
02:30:38,186 --> 02:30:39,306
Are they replacing it?

1777
02:30:41,366 --> 02:30:42,687
Yes, you're looking at the correct poll.

1778
02:30:44,707 --> 02:30:45,567
Is that really 38 feet?

1779
02:30:45,647 --> 02:30:52,969
It doesn't look like 38 feet in its current state there, no.

1780
02:30:54,009 --> 02:30:54,269
Okay.

1781
02:30:54,309 --> 02:30:59,130
I was just taking a look to see if there was...

1782
02:31:00,335 --> 02:31:02,516
I mean, there's no way.

1783
02:31:03,676 --> 02:31:06,337
So we could, it'll be replaced then.

1784
02:31:11,499 --> 02:31:13,300
Yeah, they would have to do it per the plan.

1785
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:21,623
So the plan has it that the antenna at 41 feet above grade.

1786
02:31:22,643 --> 02:31:22,863
Right.

1787
02:31:22,883 --> 02:31:23,704
Yeah.

1788
02:31:25,744 --> 02:31:27,345
So for the application.

1789
02:31:28,412 --> 02:31:30,474
make that as a condition on this poll, please?

1790
02:31:32,335 --> 02:31:33,316
Yeah, I agree.

1791
02:31:35,838 --> 02:31:38,860
So Marianne, is that a motion to grant with condition?

1792
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:38,940
Yes.

1793
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:39,640
Okay.

1794
02:31:40,501 --> 02:31:46,826
And the condition would be to confirm that it meets the offset from ground.

1795
02:31:48,807 --> 02:31:49,087
Correct?

1796
02:31:49,768 --> 02:31:50,689
Correct, thank you.

1797
02:31:50,709 --> 02:31:52,490
Okay, do we hear a second?

1798
02:31:53,631 --> 02:31:53,791
Second.

1799
02:31:53,811 --> 02:31:55,872
All right, vote.

1800
02:31:56,273 --> 02:31:56,733
Alicia Hunt?

1801
02:31:57,374 --> 02:31:57,534
Yes.

1802
02:31:58,727 --> 02:31:59,147
Momoki?

1803
02:31:59,828 --> 02:32:00,088
Yes.

1804
02:32:00,808 --> 02:32:01,449
Marion O'Connor?

1805
02:32:02,029 --> 02:32:02,269
Yes.

1806
02:32:07,112 --> 02:32:07,792
Tim McGibbon, yes.

1807
02:32:08,773 --> 02:32:09,053
Thank you.

1808
02:32:09,073 --> 02:32:13,615
All right, we're gonna move to 13 New Bern Avenue.

1809
02:32:13,635 --> 02:32:16,577
I didn't hear Marion's vote, did you hear it?

1810
02:32:17,698 --> 02:32:18,338
I did, it was yes.

1811
02:32:18,878 --> 02:32:20,379
Okay, I just didn't hear it.

1812
02:32:20,859 --> 02:32:23,221
Yeah, I believe, Marion, I'm not incorrect, right?

1813
02:32:23,736 --> 02:32:24,476
No, you're right.

1814
02:32:24,716 --> 02:32:25,016
Yes.

1815
02:32:26,577 --> 02:32:28,837
Internet is bad, so I shut my video off.

1816
02:32:28,857 --> 02:32:34,118
So hopefully you can hear me.

1817
02:32:34,138 --> 02:32:34,798
13 New Bern Ave.

1818
02:32:35,638 --> 02:32:38,099
Poll ID is 618, application 39.

1819
02:32:38,879 --> 02:32:43,980
My measurement is 18 feet horizontal distance from a three-story dwelling, as you can see there.

1820
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:48,720
ADA measurement clearance is checked out, et cetera.

1821
02:32:48,740 --> 02:32:50,341
Otherwise, I wouldn't have noted it.

1822
02:32:52,947 --> 02:32:54,608
So 13 new burnout, any emails?

1823
02:33:02,252 --> 02:33:04,553
I know where every single poll is, I mapped every single one of them.

1824
02:33:18,161 --> 02:33:20,722
I'm voting what I believe is the best interest.

1825
02:33:24,036 --> 02:33:27,517
All right.

1826
02:33:27,557 --> 02:33:28,878
Thank you, Ms.

1827
02:33:28,898 --> 02:33:32,559
Jordan, for clarifying where your comment will go on Sheridan Avenue.

1828
02:33:33,199 --> 02:33:33,819
So I appreciate that.

1829
02:33:33,839 --> 02:33:34,319
Thank you very much.

1830
02:33:34,660 --> 02:33:36,320
I don't see anything for 13 Newborn.

1831
02:33:36,340 --> 02:33:37,721
Dave, any emails?

1832
02:33:38,961 --> 02:33:40,141
No emails for this location.

1833
02:33:41,122 --> 02:33:41,182
OK.

1834
02:33:41,202 --> 02:33:44,022
Do I hear a motion?

1835
02:33:46,043 --> 02:33:47,744
Motion to approve with our conditions.

1836
02:33:48,724 --> 02:33:49,324
Do we hear a second?

1837
02:33:49,344 --> 02:33:51,925
Second.

1838
02:33:54,250 --> 02:33:56,531
All right, that was a second, I believe.

1839
02:33:57,111 --> 02:33:58,031
So call the vote.

1840
02:33:58,211 --> 02:33:58,672
Alicia Hunt?

1841
02:33:59,512 --> 02:33:59,772
Yes.

1842
02:34:00,872 --> 02:34:01,353
Paul Moki?

1843
02:34:02,013 --> 02:34:02,273
Yes.

1844
02:34:03,133 --> 02:34:03,834
Marian O'Connor?

1845
02:34:03,854 --> 02:34:05,514
The height of this pole was?

1846
02:34:05,954 --> 02:34:06,995
Sorry.

1847
02:34:07,275 --> 02:34:18,299
This is a designated utility pole is 33 feet 9 inches, and that the proposed pop of the new would be 38 feet 6 inches.

1848
02:34:20,580 --> 02:34:20,880
Yes.

1849
02:34:23,041 --> 02:34:23,761
And Tim McGibbon, yes.

1850
02:34:27,207 --> 02:34:29,029
All right, next is 8 Alfred Street.

1851
02:34:30,270 --> 02:34:36,576
Application number 38, poll 634, poll ID 634.

1852
02:34:37,737 --> 02:34:40,459
My measurements on this one, 20 feet from a three-story dwelling.

1853
02:34:45,544 --> 02:34:47,085
No emails for this location, Mr. Chairman.

1854
02:34:48,246 --> 02:34:48,827
Thank you very much.

1855
02:35:06,290 --> 02:35:15,396
And I don't see anything in the chat for 8 Alfred Street.

1856
02:35:15,416 --> 02:35:17,978
All right.

1857
02:35:23,082 --> 02:35:24,803
And we're going to the poll here.

1858
02:35:29,106 --> 02:35:30,007
Is that the right one?

1859
02:35:30,027 --> 02:35:32,128
Or I can flip back and forth.

1860
02:35:33,549 --> 02:35:34,850
That's the poll right there, correct.

1861
02:35:35,631 --> 02:35:35,971
Thank you.

1862
02:35:37,019 --> 02:35:37,219
Okay.

1863
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:40,501
Questions from the committee?

1864
02:35:42,783 --> 02:35:58,612
I'll tell you, and again, this is the existing top of the pole is 29 feet, seven inches, and that the proposed top of the new pole would be 34 feet with the equipment above that.

1865
02:36:03,695 --> 02:36:06,397
These are two stories, so it'll be significantly above what's there.

1866
02:36:09,135 --> 02:36:09,815
Do we hear any motions?

1867
02:36:10,976 --> 02:36:12,717
Motion to approve with conditions.

1868
02:36:14,738 --> 02:36:15,458
All right, do we hear a second?

1869
02:36:16,879 --> 02:36:17,259
Second.

1870
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:21,361
All right, we'll put it to a vote.

1871
02:36:21,381 --> 02:36:22,221
Alicia Hunt?

1872
02:36:22,902 --> 02:36:23,142
Yes.

1873
02:36:25,083 --> 02:36:25,583
Paul Mulkey?

1874
02:36:26,243 --> 02:36:26,484
Yes.

1875
02:36:27,664 --> 02:36:28,384
Mary Ann O'Connor?

1876
02:36:29,045 --> 02:36:29,305
Yes.

1877
02:36:30,466 --> 02:36:31,006
Tim McGivern?

1878
02:36:31,026 --> 02:36:31,246
Yes.

1879
02:36:35,248 --> 02:36:35,428
All right.

1880
02:36:35,730 --> 02:36:43,957
We will move to 236 Harvard Street, application number 46, poll ID 4618.

1881
02:36:45,218 --> 02:36:51,444
My measurement was 25 feet from a three-story dwelling, which can be seen there.

1882
02:36:54,006 --> 02:36:56,789
Any emails for 236 Harvard Street?

1883
02:36:58,150 --> 02:36:59,531
No emails for this location, Mr. Chairman.

1884
02:37:01,513 --> 02:37:01,693
Okay.

1885
02:37:04,292 --> 02:37:05,733
The chat is getting overloaded.

1886
02:37:06,293 --> 02:37:11,657
If you did want to speak on 236 Harvard Street, please let me know.

1887
02:37:11,677 --> 02:37:13,458
I don't see anything in here.

1888
02:37:13,478 --> 02:37:16,901
All right.

1889
02:37:18,321 --> 02:37:20,043
Any additional questions by the committee?

1890
02:37:26,927 --> 02:37:27,187
Is it?

1891
02:37:27,748 --> 02:37:30,510
Alicia, can you go back to that view we had a second ago?

1892
02:37:31,352 --> 02:37:32,493
I don't think it was right.

1893
02:37:32,513 --> 02:37:34,255
I was trying to get the right location.

1894
02:37:34,335 --> 02:37:36,196
So it's across from Benton Road.

1895
02:37:36,216 --> 02:37:37,317
Okay, there.

1896
02:37:37,337 --> 02:37:38,758
Sorry.

1897
02:37:40,960 --> 02:37:43,222
Things are not easy to navigate.

1898
02:37:44,343 --> 02:37:47,826
I wish the map allowed us to go into street view.

1899
02:37:47,846 --> 02:37:48,466
It's right there.

1900
02:37:49,307 --> 02:37:49,767
Yeah, okay.

1901
02:37:55,259 --> 02:37:57,039
All right, let's see, let's double check this.

1902
02:37:57,059 --> 02:38:03,481
This thing says the existing, the top of the existing utility pole is already at 38 feet.

1903
02:38:04,441 --> 02:38:09,062
And so this would go on top of the existing pole.

1904
02:38:09,082 --> 02:38:12,662
Okay.

1905
02:38:13,943 --> 02:38:14,443
Any motions?

1906
02:38:14,463 --> 02:38:18,484
Motion to approve dislocational conditions.

1907
02:38:20,524 --> 02:38:20,784
Second.

1908
02:38:23,645 --> 02:38:23,985
Second.

1909
02:38:26,219 --> 02:38:26,639
Call vote.

1910
02:38:26,979 --> 02:38:27,460
Alicia Hunt.

1911
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:28,520
Yes.

1912
02:38:29,541 --> 02:38:29,981
Paul Mulkey.

1913
02:38:30,681 --> 02:38:30,921
Yes.

1914
02:38:31,582 --> 02:38:32,222
Marion O'Connor.

1915
02:38:33,583 --> 02:38:33,883
Yes.

1916
02:38:34,383 --> 02:38:34,883
Jimmy Gibran.

1917
02:38:35,103 --> 02:38:35,303
Yes.

1918
02:38:37,685 --> 02:38:40,526
And we'll go to 549 Main Street.

1919
02:38:45,028 --> 02:38:46,129
Application 40.

1920
02:38:46,729 --> 02:38:47,889
Poll ID 543.

1921
02:38:48,510 --> 02:38:51,171
Measurement was 30 feet from multiple two-story dwellings.

1922
02:38:54,092 --> 02:38:55,473
Anything from the email?

1923
02:38:56,435 --> 02:38:57,818
No email for this location, Mr. Chairman.

1924
02:38:57,838 --> 02:39:02,486
Okay.

1925
02:39:06,854 --> 02:39:07,996
I didn't see anything in the chat.

1926
02:39:29,752 --> 02:39:30,813
I'm going to look at technology.

1927
02:39:30,873 --> 02:39:31,693
It's that poll right there, 543.

1928
02:39:32,333 --> 02:39:32,493
Yeah.

1929
02:39:32,513 --> 02:39:38,876
We're learning that we can read poll numbers.

1930
02:39:38,956 --> 02:39:44,179
We were doing this for the Streetlight Project and reading poll numbers through Google.

1931
02:39:44,259 --> 02:39:45,680
So that's the poll.

1932
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:49,862
Yeah, and Ellesmere Place is effectively a driveway.

1933
02:39:50,242 --> 02:39:51,062
There isn't a right of way there.

1934
02:39:51,082 --> 02:39:52,183
It's an easement driveway.

1935
02:39:53,524 --> 02:39:58,526
Is that a new, are they going to replace that or is that going on existing?

1936
02:39:59,935 --> 02:40:04,959
So this says top of existing utility pole is 35 feet, three inches.

1937
02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:09,763
The top of the proposed pole is 38 feet, six inches.

1938
02:40:09,783 --> 02:40:13,706
So it will be a new pole here, Alicia?

1939
02:40:13,726 --> 02:40:14,847
Yes.

1940
02:40:15,848 --> 02:40:19,791
It's pretty close to that opening there.

1941
02:40:20,151 --> 02:40:27,517
Do we know if Verizon might have an opportunity to push that a little bit to the side so they have a little more clearance to navigate that churn?

1942
02:40:30,799 --> 02:40:33,962
Sorry, I then picture people driving over the sidewalk.

1943
02:40:36,443 --> 02:40:39,686
Yeah, I mean, Paul, I'm okay in general with having the pole there.

1944
02:40:39,946 --> 02:40:42,368
It prevents people from driving on the sidewalk on that turn.

1945
02:40:43,809 --> 02:40:49,714
And there hasn't, I mean, I'm not aware of any complaints with it.

1946
02:40:53,557 --> 02:40:58,541
Yeah, it just looks a little tight there, but that's really your call, Tim, with the sidewalks.

1947
02:40:59,048 --> 02:41:04,970
You know, like I said, it kind of acts like a baller there and it does having a pole there or something like that, street furniture does protect the turning.

1948
02:41:05,410 --> 02:41:09,552
So, and we haven't, I'm not aware of any complaints.

1949
02:41:09,592 --> 02:41:10,132
I looked into it.

1950
02:41:10,472 --> 02:41:12,433
I wasn't aware of any complaints regarding the pole location.

1951
02:41:13,293 --> 02:41:15,754
So I'm inclined to leave it, leave it where it is.

1952
02:41:20,996 --> 02:41:26,818
Although if, you know, if someone wanted to, I don't think moving it a couple of feet would necessarily hurt.

1953
02:41:26,878 --> 02:41:27,838
I just don't think it's necessary.

1954
02:41:32,899 --> 02:41:38,102
Well, any discussion or a motion to approve with conditions?

1955
02:41:39,003 --> 02:41:39,884
Okay, do we have a second?

1956
02:41:42,926 --> 02:41:43,326
Second.

1957
02:41:43,486 --> 02:41:45,347
Somebody just raised their hand.

1958
02:41:45,407 --> 02:41:51,411
Was this the location or is it the next location that George Silvestro was interested in?

1959
02:41:55,153 --> 02:42:00,377
Mr. Silvestro, did you want to speak to this location?

1960
02:42:02,177 --> 02:42:03,218
You wanna let me know in the chat?

1961
02:42:06,381 --> 02:42:07,101
Yes, I'll speak.

1962
02:42:08,542 --> 02:42:10,604
On this location, 549 Main Street?

1963
02:42:11,024 --> 02:42:16,429
Yes, it's in regards to, I mean, you're talking about the pole being close to the sidewalk and all that.

1964
02:42:17,069 --> 02:42:17,210
Yeah.

1965
02:42:17,590 --> 02:42:28,419
My concern with poles like that, which there's a lot in the city, the cabinet that they're gonna put 12 feet up with the meter at eight feet, seven feet,

1966
02:42:30,773 --> 02:42:44,960
The box, the cabinet they're gonna put up is 48 feet high, 20, I mean, sorry, excuse me, 48 inches high, 24 inches wide, 21 inches deep.

1967
02:42:46,061 --> 02:42:48,282
Where on the pole is that gonna be mounted?

1968
02:42:48,662 --> 02:42:53,304
Because your typical UPS truck is at least 12 feet tall.

1969
02:42:53,484 --> 02:42:56,306
Any truck on the road is under 14 feet.

1970
02:42:56,326 --> 02:42:57,826
14 feet is the max.

1971
02:43:00,413 --> 02:43:09,617
when they pull up to a curb, if it's mounted on the sidewalk side or the street side, because from what I understand, the poles are supposed to be 10 inches from the curb.

1972
02:43:11,778 --> 02:43:15,119
So they're gonna be in the street if they're mounted on the outside of the pole.

1973
02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:22,242
We're gonna pull the application and take a look at where it shows the mounting.

1974
02:43:23,162 --> 02:43:24,623
Is the cabinet,

1975
02:43:28,754 --> 02:43:34,736
21 flush to the pole, 21 inches deep flush to the pole or is there a bracket on the cap?

1976
02:43:38,797 --> 02:43:56,303
The application that I'm looking at shows the equipment being the box that I believe that you're referring to that starts at 12 feet, that it's about a foot or two above

1977
02:43:57,214 --> 02:44:03,359
the existing street sign and it faces that Ellesmere at it.

1978
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:05,481
I don't know how to explain it.

1979
02:44:05,541 --> 02:44:07,303
It's perpendicular to me.

1980
02:44:07,663 --> 02:44:09,484
It faces the houses.

1981
02:44:10,105 --> 02:44:12,547
It's on the inside of the pole, not the outside.

1982
02:44:12,887 --> 02:44:14,389
No, it's on neither.

1983
02:44:14,869 --> 02:44:17,331
It's on the sideways to the street.

1984
02:44:17,731 --> 02:44:18,932
It's sideways to the street.

1985
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:24,337
According to the- It would be on the left of the pole, on the right of the pole going into the driveway.

1986
02:44:26,597 --> 02:44:27,237
I think so.

1987
02:44:27,277 --> 02:44:32,139
We can certainly condition this that it doesn't interfere with vehicular movements.

1988
02:44:33,140 --> 02:44:39,082
Well, that's my concern that depends on where they mount these boxes on all these poles.

1989
02:44:40,203 --> 02:44:43,264
Yeah, they're generally above the vehicular zone.

1990
02:44:43,944 --> 02:44:44,925
That is something I looked at.

1991
02:44:45,685 --> 02:44:50,447
But I agree, there's this one because 12 feet isn't above it.

1992
02:44:50,987 --> 02:44:53,908
Because 14 feet is the clearance, yes.

1993
02:44:57,078 --> 02:45:03,484
If there is a potential for this to be in a vehicle zone, we can condition it, that it's not obstructing.

1994
02:45:04,104 --> 02:45:06,707
And this is the idea of having a little bit of control here.

1995
02:45:07,528 --> 02:45:08,869
The city has a little bit of control.

1996
02:45:08,969 --> 02:45:18,858
So we can condition this pole to say that it cannot obstruct any typical vehicle movements into Ellesmere Terrace.

1997
02:45:19,899 --> 02:45:21,520
So that's how I would wanna deal with it.

1998
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:23,282
And that's some of the control that the city has here.

1999
02:45:23,820 --> 02:45:32,483
Yeah, I think it's going to apply to a lot of poles, depending on where they put that.

2000
02:45:32,683 --> 02:45:38,965
And the electric meter is going to be seven, eight feet, I believe.

2001
02:45:41,625 --> 02:45:49,768
If it's right under it, that's going to get hit too, if a truck rubs against it or something.

2002
02:45:50,482 --> 02:45:50,702
Yep.

2003
02:45:50,802 --> 02:45:52,843
And then that's my concern.

2004
02:45:53,403 --> 02:45:54,103
It is a good concern.

2005
02:45:54,363 --> 02:46:06,306
I think I'd like to whoever makes the motion if they could consider a condition for this one to specifically say that it doesn't obstruct typical vehicular movements onto Ellesmere Terrace.

2006
02:46:06,446 --> 02:46:08,727
I think Verizon would like to respond to that.

2007
02:46:09,987 --> 02:46:10,747
Yeah, they can respond to that.

2008
02:46:13,162 --> 02:46:24,148
Mr. McGibbon, I'd just like to bring up the fact that since we filed these applications, the technology's changed the way that we do not need those boxes on the big box on a pole.

2009
02:46:26,490 --> 02:46:26,750
Okay.

2010
02:46:27,990 --> 02:46:32,713
So it's much smaller equipment, it's the meter, a disconnect, and then the antenna and radio is above.

2011
02:46:33,774 --> 02:46:37,896
Okay, that's less visually impactful, so I appreciate that, certainly.

2012
02:46:39,825 --> 02:46:52,155
Okay, I still think, you know, just because where this one is, I don't, I mean, I wouldn't imagine that you'd want to put them in the vehicle turning zone, but just to sort of make sure, and it was brought up as a concern, and it's a legitimate concern.

2013
02:46:52,435 --> 02:47:02,383
So I think that should be a condition for this particular poll, just to confirm that it doesn't obstruct any vehicular movements onto Ellesmere Terrace, whatever the equipment is.

2014
02:47:02,704 --> 02:47:05,526
So if that's already the case, then it shouldn't be a big deal.

2015
02:47:06,207 --> 02:47:06,487
Thank you.

2016
02:47:07,733 --> 02:47:08,914
Okay, thank you, Mrs. Sylvester.

2017
02:47:08,934 --> 02:47:12,877
I appreciate the constructive comments.

2018
02:47:14,137 --> 02:47:23,404
I move to approve with the condition that nothing obstructs the vehicular movements.

2019
02:47:24,264 --> 02:47:25,825
Is that appropriate?

2020
02:47:26,846 --> 02:47:27,867
Onto Ellesmere Terrace.

2021
02:47:28,347 --> 02:47:29,488
Onto Ellesmere Terrace.

2022
02:47:30,028 --> 02:47:33,991
Yeah, or off Ellesmere Terrace.

2023
02:47:36,312 --> 02:47:37,013
Do we have a second?

2024
02:47:39,370 --> 02:47:39,970
I'll second it.

2025
02:47:39,990 --> 02:47:41,971
All right, we'll call a vote.

2026
02:47:42,052 --> 02:47:42,492
Alicia Hunt?

2027
02:47:43,412 --> 02:47:43,652
Yes.

2028
02:47:46,934 --> 02:47:47,294
Palmer?

2029
02:47:48,295 --> 02:47:49,056
Yes.

2030
02:47:49,576 --> 02:47:50,316
Marion O'Connor?

2031
02:47:51,137 --> 02:47:51,417
Yes.

2032
02:47:53,298 --> 02:47:54,038
Tim McGibbon, yes.

2033
02:48:00,042 --> 02:48:05,805
All right, next one is 89 Princeton Street, application 47, poll 2296.

2034
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:15,862
It appears, is it actually on Radcliffe Street?

2035
02:48:16,543 --> 02:48:17,123
That is correct.

2036
02:48:17,143 --> 02:48:22,167
This pole is actually on Radcliffe Street, but it's next to 89 Princeton Street, which is the house.

2037
02:48:23,007 --> 02:48:23,608
Oh, I see.

2038
02:48:23,648 --> 02:48:24,288
Thank you.

2039
02:48:29,172 --> 02:48:36,377
My other measurement on that, 25 feet from multiple three-story dwellings, horizontal distance.

2040
02:48:42,728 --> 02:48:45,510
All right, and this is- Everyone will receive no emails on this location.

2041
02:48:46,091 --> 02:48:47,112
Thank you, you read my mind.

2042
02:48:47,132 --> 02:48:49,113
89 Fenton Street, let's see.

2043
02:48:49,994 --> 02:49:01,763
This poll here in the distance for the street view, I think the distance helps us sort of see the, oops, and this is it up close, right?

2044
02:49:02,624 --> 02:49:03,925
Or did I get the wrong one?

2045
02:49:04,745 --> 02:49:07,147
Apologize.

2046
02:49:17,492 --> 02:49:21,994
I don't see anything on 89 Princeton Street in the chat.

2047
02:49:24,974 --> 02:49:29,256
Again, I'm gonna ask people that general comments.

2048
02:49:29,656 --> 02:49:36,758
I think the information that people have been asking for is

2049
02:49:43,075 --> 02:49:47,057
This says top of existing utility pole is 29 feet.

2050
02:49:49,819 --> 02:49:55,161
The proposed top of new utility pole is 38 feet, six inches.

2051
02:49:55,181 --> 02:50:05,787
There's nothing else different about this one.

2052
02:50:11,660 --> 02:50:11,920
Right.

2053
02:50:12,441 --> 02:50:14,562
And there was no emails, none in the chat.

2054
02:50:17,244 --> 02:50:18,404
And I did my review of this one.

2055
02:50:20,366 --> 02:50:22,567
Any other comments from the committee or do we hear a motion?

2056
02:50:24,348 --> 02:50:26,009
Motion to approve without conditions.

2057
02:50:26,990 --> 02:50:27,150
Okay.

2058
02:50:27,210 --> 02:50:27,811
Do we hear a second?

2059
02:50:28,691 --> 02:50:29,092
Second.

2060
02:50:30,032 --> 02:50:30,372
All right.

2061
02:50:30,633 --> 02:50:31,073
Leishon?

2062
02:50:31,913 --> 02:50:32,154
Yes.

2063
02:50:33,074 --> 02:50:33,554
Pamoki?

2064
02:50:34,455 --> 02:50:34,735
Yes.

2065
02:50:35,396 --> 02:50:36,176
Mary Ann O'Connor?

2066
02:50:37,177 --> 02:50:37,517
Yes.

2067
02:50:38,137 --> 02:50:38,718
Tim McGivern?

2068
02:50:38,858 --> 02:50:39,118
Yes.

2069
02:50:39,398 --> 02:50:39,999
Thank you very much.

2070
02:50:44,641 --> 02:50:53,928
We're gonna do Marion Street, and then we'll do the one at 499 Main Street, and then I'll propose a five-minute break before we go into Hillside, Evermistic area.

2071
02:50:55,470 --> 02:50:59,733
All right, 62 Marion Street, 4497.

2072
02:51:02,115 --> 02:51:08,920
Application, number 37, 30 feet to closest three-story dwelling, multiple buildings.

2073
02:51:09,381 --> 02:51:11,722
So.

2074
02:51:11,762 --> 02:51:13,784
And Mr. Chairman, we received no emails on this location.

2075
02:51:14,705 --> 02:51:14,985
All right.

2076
02:51:28,528 --> 02:51:29,108
All right, there it is.

2077
02:51:29,128 --> 02:51:34,529
I don't see anything in the chat.

2078
02:51:40,110 --> 02:51:42,971
I believe it's that poll there.

2079
02:51:42,991 --> 02:51:43,111
OK.

2080
02:51:45,478 --> 02:51:47,179
Yeah, that looks familiar.

2081
02:51:50,240 --> 02:52:00,303
The application says that the existing utility pole is 33 feet nine inches and that this equipment would go on top of the existing pole.

2082
02:52:00,323 --> 02:52:03,104
Okay.

2083
02:52:04,844 --> 02:52:07,625
Any other concerns or questions from the committee or a motion?

2084
02:52:07,745 --> 02:52:09,386
So how high would that be?

2085
02:52:09,706 --> 02:52:10,386
Hold on.

2086
02:52:14,554 --> 02:52:22,840
Sorry, it says that the equipment would start at 33, well, its base is at 33 feet 9.

2087
02:52:23,220 --> 02:52:29,465
It says the CL of proposed antennas is 36 feet 3 inches.

2088
02:52:29,485 --> 02:52:31,126
Thank you.

2089
02:52:37,251 --> 02:52:38,112
Anything else from the committee?

2090
02:52:38,132 --> 02:52:43,976
We can hear a motion whenever someone's ready.

2091
02:52:46,937 --> 02:52:49,018
Motion to approve with our standard conditions.

2092
02:52:50,098 --> 02:52:50,998
All right, do we have a second?

2093
02:52:52,779 --> 02:52:53,159
Second.

2094
02:52:54,780 --> 02:52:55,620
Roll call, Alicia Hunt?

2095
02:52:55,640 --> 02:52:55,700
Yes.

2096
02:52:56,380 --> 02:52:58,141
Pamela Mulkey?

2097
02:52:58,741 --> 02:52:59,001
Yes.

2098
02:53:00,022 --> 02:53:00,782
Mary Ann O'Connor?

2099
02:53:01,462 --> 02:53:01,822
Yes.

2100
02:53:02,883 --> 02:53:03,663
Tim McGibbon is a yes.

2101
02:53:09,617 --> 02:53:22,728
All right, the next poll on the agenda is application number five, Main Street, close proximity to 499, which isn't necessarily a good bearing.

2102
02:53:22,788 --> 02:53:25,610
It's the outside of the Tufts pool building on Main Street.

2103
02:53:27,612 --> 02:53:30,294
Mr. Chairman, there are no emails for that location.

2104
02:53:31,015 --> 02:53:31,415
Okay, thank you.

2105
02:53:49,967 --> 02:53:51,148
I don't see anything in the chat.

2106
02:53:53,530 --> 02:53:59,654
Again, if inundated with general comments in the chat, I appreciate the comments.

2107
02:54:00,134 --> 02:54:02,836
It just makes it more difficult for me to find the site-specific ones.

2108
02:54:02,856 --> 02:54:10,182
So if you've submitted a site-specific request for comment earlier, please try to refresh it if you can when it comes up.

2109
02:54:10,942 --> 02:54:11,222
Thank you.

2110
02:54:11,663 --> 02:54:12,964
And I know Ms.

2111
02:54:12,984 --> 02:54:13,424
Kendall and Ms.

2112
02:54:13,464 --> 02:54:15,506
Jordan are on for 101 Sheridan.

2113
02:54:20,118 --> 02:54:22,740
All right, so there's that.

2114
02:54:28,065 --> 02:54:30,627
So it's this one, I believe, is that correct?

2115
02:54:33,189 --> 02:54:34,230
By your description?

2116
02:54:34,730 --> 02:54:37,533
Yeah, go to the map here just so I can double check.

2117
02:54:37,593 --> 02:54:39,094
I believe it is, but just so I can double check.

2118
02:54:41,636 --> 02:54:43,978
Between the entrance to the playground?

2119
02:54:43,998 --> 02:54:46,120
Is that it?

2120
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:46,360
Yeah.

2121
02:54:47,341 --> 02:54:48,462
Left side of the building, yeah.

2122
02:54:49,928 --> 02:54:51,849
in the playground and the, oops.

2123
02:54:53,390 --> 02:54:54,031
Yeah, that's it, Alicia.

2124
02:54:54,051 --> 02:54:54,711
That's the one.

2125
02:54:54,791 --> 02:54:56,473
And it has the spotlight on it.

2126
02:54:56,993 --> 02:55:03,858
It does indicate, the application actually indicates it has the existing spotlight on it.

2127
02:55:07,220 --> 02:55:17,127
It says the existing top of utility pole is 29 feet, five inches, and the top of existing

2128
02:55:18,151 --> 02:55:20,412
Street light, is it 31 feet?

2129
02:55:20,913 --> 02:55:25,635
And the proposed antenna height, is it 31 feet?

2130
02:55:26,236 --> 02:55:29,278
This is the shortest one that we've seen so far.

2131
02:55:29,718 --> 02:55:31,859
Most of them, they're going up higher than that.

2132
02:55:34,961 --> 02:55:42,345
I am a little perplexed that this equipment won't interfere with our street light that's there, either one, at least the one that lifts up.

2133
02:55:43,326 --> 02:55:47,028
I don't know, it might be helpful for Verizon to speak to that a little bit.

2134
02:55:48,552 --> 02:56:02,155
Okay, rising Can you speak to that.

2135
02:56:02,235 --> 02:56:04,576
So, what the question is if it would interfere with the streetlight.

2136
02:56:05,096 --> 02:56:07,356
Right, so this is the shortest location.

2137
02:56:07,836 --> 02:56:10,257
Most of them have going up a little higher than this.

2138
02:56:11,353 --> 02:56:24,980
And our street light actually, as indicated at your survey and what we can see there, actually reaches up above the top of the pole and then your equipment is gonna start at that same height and go up.

2139
02:56:25,700 --> 02:56:33,484
So is there any interference between them here and why is this pole not going up higher the way the others were?

2140
02:56:37,470 --> 02:56:39,690
The pole is remaining as it is.

2141
02:56:39,750 --> 02:56:41,611
That's a National Grid's decision.

2142
02:56:41,911 --> 02:56:46,432
We submit the application, and they kind of tell us what, if the pole needs to be replaced or not.

2143
02:56:49,232 --> 02:56:54,253
And there wouldn't be any, there shouldn't be any interference with the light.

2144
02:56:54,533 --> 02:57:01,695
It would be fine if there was a condition, if there was any sort of interference that you guys thought was coming from our antenna to check it out.

2145
02:57:02,195 --> 02:57:03,355
But we've been installing these

2146
02:57:04,649 --> 02:57:09,976
throughout New England, and we haven't had any interference with any lights, LED, or connected lights even.

2147
02:57:12,600 --> 02:57:14,262
I was assuming physical.

2148
02:57:14,463 --> 02:57:15,524
I will radiate.

2149
02:57:16,910 --> 02:57:27,595
sorry, reiterate, as we mentioned at the last meeting, the city owns the streetlights on the city streets, not National Grid.

2150
02:57:29,156 --> 02:57:33,198
So both of the lights on this pole are owned by the city.

2151
02:57:34,259 --> 02:57:42,783
So we would not want, if there was any difficulty, if things had to be adjusted, you'd be in touch with us about it and you would cover the cost.

2152
02:57:44,699 --> 02:57:47,921
That's one of our conditions, but I'm pointing it out on this location.

2153
02:57:47,982 --> 02:58:02,572
It's already one of our... Did anybody else have anything?

2154
02:58:03,532 --> 02:58:06,875
So the final high of the equipment would be less than 33 feet.

2155
02:58:09,759 --> 02:58:14,983
that says that the top of the proposed antennas is 33 feet and the bottom is 31 feet.

2156
02:58:15,163 --> 02:58:15,344
Okay.

2157
02:58:23,290 --> 02:58:38,162
So Verizon, when you're talking about the equipment should not interfere with the street light, I forget what address it was, but a few minutes ago, you made a comment about the technology changing.

2158
02:58:38,655 --> 02:58:40,456
since these plans were prepared.

2159
02:58:42,036 --> 02:58:43,256
Could you address that?

2160
02:58:43,396 --> 02:58:48,978
Is the technology changing in terms of how that's affecting what we're looking at on the plans?

2161
02:58:49,518 --> 02:58:53,480
Will there be more equipment than we're looking at or is it going to be smaller or less?

2162
02:58:54,680 --> 02:58:58,001
Yeah, the equipment actually all got smaller since we filed the application.

2163
02:58:58,041 --> 02:59:04,323
So the box is down to a smaller unit and the meters are standard size.

2164
02:59:08,828 --> 02:59:14,732
Same configuration and the same amount of boxes on there, basically.

2165
02:59:16,513 --> 02:59:17,554
Correct.

2166
02:59:17,574 --> 02:59:18,915
Smaller in size than, right?

2167
02:59:19,055 --> 02:59:20,796
Smaller in size, right.

2168
02:59:28,662 --> 02:59:29,302
Do we have a motion?

2169
02:59:32,104 --> 02:59:32,384
All right.

2170
02:59:32,404 --> 02:59:34,406
A motion to approve without conditions.

2171
02:59:36,027 --> 02:59:36,387
Second.

2172
02:59:37,928 --> 02:59:38,748
All right, call vote.

2173
02:59:38,989 --> 02:59:39,449
Alicia Hunt?

2174
02:59:40,049 --> 02:59:40,249
Yes.

2175
02:59:41,990 --> 02:59:42,410
Paul Moki?

2176
02:59:43,151 --> 02:59:43,411
Yes.

2177
02:59:44,692 --> 02:59:45,352
Mary Ann O'Connor?

2178
02:59:46,012 --> 02:59:46,293
No.

2179
02:59:48,414 --> 02:59:49,514
And Tim McGibbon, yes.

2180
02:59:50,715 --> 02:59:52,776
So that's three yes, one no.

2181
02:59:55,998 --> 02:59:56,578
Thank you very much.

2182
02:59:56,978 --> 02:59:59,480
We're gonna take a five minute recess.

2183
03:00:00,695 --> 03:00:08,297
So, and then we'll come back and we'll get to as many as we think we can in a reasonable timeframe.

2184
03:00:09,077 --> 03:00:17,059
Just so folks understand, that's one third of the applications, okay?

2185
03:00:18,139 --> 03:00:23,240
So we will, sorry, do we need a vote on taking a recess, Robin?

2186
03:00:25,852 --> 03:00:31,276
No, I think you can just tell everyone you're having a recess and the hearing's still open.

2187
03:00:31,296 --> 03:00:32,337
You'll be back in five minutes.

2188
03:00:32,938 --> 03:00:33,718
Okay, so it's 9.32 now.

2189
03:00:33,738 --> 03:00:34,198
9.37 we will return.

2190
03:00:34,219 --> 03:00:34,839
So starting now.

2191
03:00:34,859 --> 03:00:36,080
Thank you very much.

2192
03:04:44,450 --> 03:04:46,070
All right, it's 9.37.

2193
03:04:46,771 --> 03:04:47,631
Get the committee back.

2194
03:05:04,855 --> 03:05:12,017
Thank you.

2195
03:05:41,202 --> 03:05:43,042
All right, welcome back everybody, thank you.

2196
03:05:43,062 --> 03:05:47,663
All right, so we're gonna keep moving.

2197
03:05:50,904 --> 03:05:55,425
We will go until this committee runs out of steam and is not able to function anymore.

2198
03:05:55,945 --> 03:06:00,366
And we're gonna have to see where that lands us, okay?

2199
03:06:02,426 --> 03:06:07,747
So we're gonna go ahead and we're going to open up the hearing for 50 George Street.

2200
03:06:08,648 --> 03:06:10,268
So this is application number one.

2201
03:06:14,219 --> 03:06:21,325
And it is poll ID 2150.

2202
03:06:23,626 --> 03:06:25,848
And maybe Alicia's not back yet.

2203
03:06:26,649 --> 03:06:28,210
Mr. Chairman, I'd probably take the roll again.

2204
03:06:28,230 --> 03:06:30,011
Yeah.

2205
03:06:30,232 --> 03:06:32,053
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2206
03:06:33,194 --> 03:06:33,454
No way.

2207
03:06:33,514 --> 03:06:34,135
Alicia, are you here?

2208
03:06:36,096 --> 03:06:36,577
Paul, are you here?

2209
03:06:39,319 --> 03:06:40,019
I see Marianne.

2210
03:06:40,239 --> 03:06:40,820
Marianne's here.

2211
03:06:41,659 --> 03:06:47,862
No Paul yet, no Alicia, so we'll wait a minute until we get back on track here.

2212
03:06:48,563 --> 03:06:49,203
Tim, I'm here.

2213
03:06:49,223 --> 03:06:50,824
All right, thank you, Paul.

2214
03:06:51,124 --> 03:06:51,845
And we got Alicia.

2215
03:06:51,865 --> 03:06:54,946
There's Alicia, okay.

2216
03:06:56,287 --> 03:06:56,987
And we got Marianne.

2217
03:06:59,649 --> 03:07:06,793
You guys all set?

2218
03:07:06,813 --> 03:07:09,234
Any objections from the committee to keep moving?

2219
03:07:10,375 --> 03:07:10,975
Next application.

2220
03:07:12,075 --> 03:07:21,019
Alicia, what I just said and Marianne and Paul, we're gonna keep going until this committee runs out of steam.

2221
03:07:21,039 --> 03:07:21,419
9.40 now.

2222
03:07:22,159 --> 03:07:26,121
So, and obviously we're about a third away through the applications.

2223
03:07:26,681 --> 03:07:27,702
So we're gonna keep plugging.

2224
03:07:27,822 --> 03:07:33,484
I'm gonna try to maintain the situation as I have been trying to do.

2225
03:07:33,584 --> 03:07:34,825
So we will continue.

2226
03:07:35,898 --> 03:07:39,701
Which group are you going to next so that I can start to queue it up?

2227
03:07:40,082 --> 03:07:42,063
Yep, 50 George Street is the next one.

2228
03:07:42,664 --> 03:07:46,427
It's application number one, is poll ID 2150.

2229
03:07:46,467 --> 03:07:50,711
And this poll is actually in the Wedgmere right of way, Alicia.

2230
03:07:50,911 --> 03:07:51,451
It's on the corner.

2231
03:07:51,471 --> 03:08:00,399
All right.

2232
03:08:04,002 --> 03:08:11,989
So this antenna is within about 20 feet of a second story at about the roof line or above.

2233
03:08:14,752 --> 03:08:15,712
My measurements on this one.

2234
03:08:18,595 --> 03:08:19,896
And we're gonna, Alicia.

2235
03:08:22,158 --> 03:08:23,900
We received no emails on this location, Mr. Trim.

2236
03:08:23,980 --> 03:08:25,641
All right, no emails on this one.

2237
03:08:25,661 --> 03:08:26,382
Let me check the chat.

2238
03:08:33,680 --> 03:08:39,143
Okay, so 50 George Street.

2239
03:08:39,363 --> 03:08:40,484
You can see it there.

2240
03:08:40,504 --> 03:08:42,325
I can go to Street View in a second.

2241
03:08:42,425 --> 03:08:43,505
I was just taking a look.

2242
03:08:45,446 --> 03:08:50,009
Top of the existing utility pole at 29 feet.

2243
03:08:51,129 --> 03:08:54,411
And then the proposed antenna height would be 31 feet.

2244
03:09:04,101 --> 03:09:08,602
All right, no emails, I didn't see anything coming from the chat for this one.

2245
03:09:12,383 --> 03:09:26,207
So it's open to the committee for any more questions or a motion.

2246
03:09:26,487 --> 03:09:29,308
This one with the T stop sign on it, is that correct?

2247
03:09:41,888 --> 03:09:42,168
Which?

2248
03:09:43,669 --> 03:09:45,231
On the curved side of Georgia Street.

2249
03:09:46,252 --> 03:09:47,093
On the curve.

2250
03:09:47,893 --> 03:09:50,015
Yeah, so way across here.

2251
03:09:50,676 --> 03:09:52,177
Yeah, it's on the curve.

2252
03:09:54,059 --> 03:09:56,521
It's the one with the sign on it, the dead end sign.

2253
03:09:58,143 --> 03:09:58,643
That's the one.

2254
03:09:59,184 --> 03:10:00,845
The one with the dead end sign on it?

2255
03:10:01,206 --> 03:10:01,366
Yeah.

2256
03:10:02,357 --> 03:10:10,379
So the top of that existing pole, which is clearly in line with that house's top of chimney.

2257
03:10:18,800 --> 03:10:19,501
Yes, sorry.

2258
03:10:20,621 --> 03:10:22,361
We get a little slower the later we get.

2259
03:10:22,381 --> 03:10:23,621
All right.

2260
03:10:25,362 --> 03:10:26,282
Any other comments?

2261
03:10:30,603 --> 03:10:31,643
Comments or questions or a motion?

2262
03:10:33,686 --> 03:10:37,829
I'll move to approve with our regular conditions.

2263
03:10:39,270 --> 03:10:39,870
Do we hear a second?

2264
03:10:41,351 --> 03:10:41,692
Second.

2265
03:10:43,253 --> 03:10:44,193
All right, roll call vote.

2266
03:10:44,293 --> 03:10:44,794
Alicia Hunt?

2267
03:10:46,715 --> 03:10:46,975
Yes.

2268
03:10:48,416 --> 03:10:48,876
Paul Mulkey?

2269
03:10:49,577 --> 03:10:49,837
Yes.

2270
03:10:50,497 --> 03:10:51,298
Mary Ann O'Connor?

2271
03:10:51,958 --> 03:10:52,219
No.

2272
03:10:53,760 --> 03:10:54,380
Tim McGibbon?

2273
03:10:54,600 --> 03:10:54,820
Yes.

2274
03:10:58,603 --> 03:11:00,144
Okay, next one is 200 Boston Avenue.

2275
03:11:02,202 --> 03:11:06,305
Application number 15, hole 787.

2276
03:11:06,606 --> 03:11:13,611
And while Alicia is navigating there, Dave, will you check the emails?

2277
03:11:16,053 --> 03:11:17,594
No emails for that location, Mr. Chairman.

2278
03:11:18,275 --> 03:11:18,615
OK.

2279
03:11:18,795 --> 03:11:20,957
And I don't see anything in the chat.

2280
03:11:20,977 --> 03:11:23,459
200 Boston Avenue.

2281
03:11:26,633 --> 03:11:33,378
And then my measurements, this one is within 60 feet of a three-story residential building.

2282
03:11:33,398 --> 03:11:43,184
Yeah, it's basically out front of 200 Boston Avenue.

2283
03:11:46,686 --> 03:11:46,907
Yeah.

2284
03:11:52,771 --> 03:11:54,211
I believe it's that pole right there, Alicia.

2285
03:11:54,231 --> 03:11:55,132
We might want to double check.

2286
03:11:57,175 --> 03:11:57,733
crossing sign.

2287
03:12:09,168 --> 03:12:14,709
Yes, you can see on the proposal, it says existing street signs will be relocated if necessary.

2288
03:12:15,609 --> 03:12:29,772
So I guess I'm wondering from Verizon is if with their new equipment, they no longer need to move the street sign or if they'd like to upgrade and improve it to a flashing one, more reflective one while they're at it.

2289
03:12:33,532 --> 03:12:38,493
It's right in the area of where our equipment still would land on the pole.

2290
03:12:42,764 --> 03:12:45,265
Would you guys, do you want to go ahead?

2291
03:12:46,105 --> 03:12:46,785
What does that mean?

2292
03:12:47,545 --> 03:13:05,049
I was just going to suggest they could put in a newer, if they're going to be relocating and we have a crossing sign there for a reason to help people, they could, can there still be the crossing sign on the pole with the equipment?

2293
03:13:05,129 --> 03:13:08,369
And if so, then can you put a nice new sign on?

2294
03:13:10,950 --> 03:13:11,310
We could.

2295
03:13:11,798 --> 03:13:20,904
We could put a sign similar to that on a metal pole, like you'd see if it wasn't attached to the utility pole.

2296
03:13:21,704 --> 03:13:27,828
Like install a metal pole next to the utility pole that would have the crossing sign on it.

2297
03:13:29,049 --> 03:13:29,269
Right.

2298
03:13:32,411 --> 03:13:35,273
Tim, you're more on top of street furniture than I am.

2299
03:13:38,846 --> 03:13:40,487
Yeah, I mean, that would be acceptable.

2300
03:13:40,728 --> 03:13:44,050
I like the idea of upgrading it if we can.

2301
03:13:46,152 --> 03:13:50,576
If it needs to be relocated, we shouldn't put something there that needs to be updated.

2302
03:13:53,919 --> 03:14:02,907
We have a current standards that we usually, we've been doing with flashing, with fluorescent, neon.

2303
03:14:03,726 --> 03:14:06,789
Yeah, like solar powered ones that flash.

2304
03:14:07,329 --> 03:14:09,571
There are those that are just the signs.

2305
03:14:09,591 --> 03:14:15,196
There's something like that we could ask them to do.

2306
03:14:15,216 --> 03:14:19,720
I'm going to be able to add another poll right there in front of that.

2307
03:14:21,847 --> 03:14:34,913
If it meets clearances, when I was looking at this, I wasn't necessarily thinking of the sign relocation with the presumption that there seems to be plenty of room in the furniture zone here.

2308
03:14:34,933 --> 03:14:38,715
There's a couple of trees.

2309
03:14:39,055 --> 03:14:40,956
There's actually not many trees.

2310
03:14:41,116 --> 03:14:42,196
There's a hydrant, as you can see.

2311
03:14:42,677 --> 03:14:45,918
But in general, the block has a pretty clear furniture zone.

2312
03:14:46,598 --> 03:14:49,980
So I'm sure there's a location that would work.

2313
03:14:50,440 --> 03:14:56,302
whether it's ahead of the pole, behind the pole, or on the other side of the crosswalk.

2314
03:14:56,742 --> 03:15:01,164
Because as you can see, this says crossing ahead, but it's kind of in the wrong spot.

2315
03:15:01,484 --> 03:15:04,005
It's really, you just passed the crossing.

2316
03:15:05,565 --> 03:15:17,090
So this one, I would like to condition that a sign that meets current standards is installed ahead of the crosswalk in this location.

2317
03:15:20,116 --> 03:15:21,798
And that's on Verizon to do.

2318
03:15:22,738 --> 03:15:25,100
Yeah, that would be them if they have to relocate that sign.

2319
03:15:25,140 --> 03:15:27,422
Yeah, and that would be my condition.

2320
03:15:27,442 --> 03:15:31,366
And again, folks, this is another example of the small control that the city would have here.

2321
03:15:33,408 --> 03:15:34,649
Can I ask a quick question?

2322
03:15:34,669 --> 03:15:40,594
Is there an existing pole that's right there that might be already considered for the town?

2323
03:15:40,614 --> 03:15:42,896
Looks like there's a little metal pole there right in front of this crosswalk.

2324
03:15:42,916 --> 03:15:43,957
Yeah, that spot.

2325
03:15:45,662 --> 03:15:47,283
Yeah, I mean, that could be considered.

2326
03:15:47,764 --> 03:15:52,748
I think I'd like to condition this to have the city approve the new location of the sign.

2327
03:15:52,768 --> 03:16:10,403
If that's an appropriate one, and if that poll is sufficient to hold the standard signs that we're installing now, which are the solar powered flashing crossing signs.

2328
03:16:12,845 --> 03:16:13,306
Yeah, that's right.

2329
03:16:15,144 --> 03:16:23,730
Maybe this poll would work, Alicia, but I would rather have it a little bit broader, where we would need to approve the location.

2330
03:16:25,131 --> 03:16:29,994
Because there are certain distances that you try to meet if you can.

2331
03:16:30,234 --> 03:16:32,256
So we'd want to try to meet that distance.

2332
03:16:33,416 --> 03:16:36,759
And I'm not sure, just looking at if that poll is acceptable.

2333
03:16:38,082 --> 03:16:50,611
A condition that the new crosswalk signage has to be installed at the approval with the coordination and approval of our traffic director or director of traffic.

2334
03:16:51,212 --> 03:16:51,432
Yeah.

2335
03:16:53,213 --> 03:16:53,393
Yep.

2336
03:16:54,834 --> 03:16:56,956
And the height of that pole that they're proposing.

2337
03:16:56,976 --> 03:17:06,563
So the existing utility pole is 34 feet 11 inches, and it says that the equipment would start shortly above that.

2338
03:17:08,242 --> 03:17:08,602
Thank you.

2339
03:17:10,784 --> 03:17:21,970
Tim, getting back to that existing post, if we're gonna use that to mount the new sign, I'm trying to see, looking at this picture, I'm not sure what clearance is.

2340
03:17:22,030 --> 03:17:31,036
Can we add a condition that you also have approval on that as far as sidewalk regulations that we have proper clearance around that pole also?

2341
03:17:31,056 --> 03:17:37,640
Yeah, Paul, I want to condition it so the exact location needs to be approved by director of traffic.

2342
03:17:38,511 --> 03:17:40,051
Okay.

2343
03:17:40,071 --> 03:17:44,272
That way that covers all the bases because it's all quite, we don't want to miss any sort of nuances.

2344
03:17:44,792 --> 03:17:57,255
It's kind of a bunch of factors and variables in play distance from the crosswalk ADA clearance clearances offsets and curb offsets from other street furniture, etc.

2345
03:17:57,295 --> 03:17:58,015
And the list goes on.

2346
03:17:58,355 --> 03:18:03,456
So, um, I'd like to have just the

2347
03:18:04,337 --> 03:18:05,418
the location approved.

2348
03:18:05,718 --> 03:18:13,804
If it happens to be that pole, that's serendipity, but if it needs to be a new location, it needs to be a new location.

2349
03:18:13,824 --> 03:18:15,045
So not a big to do there.

2350
03:18:15,886 --> 03:18:17,948
Are there any objections from Verizon on that?

2351
03:18:22,771 --> 03:18:32,839
The benefit of those who may not be aware, the director of traffic works in Tim's office, so it's easy for him to say that, yes, he will coordinate with you on this.

2352
03:18:33,319 --> 03:18:33,600
That's right.

2353
03:18:41,077 --> 03:18:43,460
Okay, so we don't have an objection to that.

2354
03:18:45,063 --> 03:18:56,759
I think having some more detail in terms of exactly what you're looking for will be helpful, but I guess we'll get that through the coordination with the traffic director.

2355
03:18:57,375 --> 03:18:58,135
Yeah, two things.

2356
03:18:58,615 --> 03:19:02,157
The new standard we're doing for these signs is a solar-powered flasher.

2357
03:19:02,317 --> 03:19:04,337
I don't think it's a huge extra expense.

2358
03:19:05,358 --> 03:19:09,659
And the location would just have to be confirmed.

2359
03:19:09,699 --> 03:19:10,959
We can even mark it out for you.

2360
03:19:11,480 --> 03:19:12,480
That's probably the easiest way to do it.

2361
03:19:12,500 --> 03:19:13,860
That's usually how we do something like this.

2362
03:19:14,320 --> 03:19:21,803
So the director of traffic, Alicia's correct, works out of my office, would place that location on the pavement for coordination.

2363
03:19:23,113 --> 03:19:27,816
So, and if it happens to be that poll, you know, I can't see, there might be another sign on there.

2364
03:19:27,836 --> 03:19:28,317
I'm not sure.

2365
03:19:28,377 --> 03:19:29,978
So that's why I'm not committing to that poll at all.

2366
03:19:30,558 --> 03:19:34,881
So, okay.

2367
03:19:37,243 --> 03:19:37,563
All right.

2368
03:19:40,365 --> 03:19:42,586
We hear any more discussion questions or emotion?

2369
03:19:44,268 --> 03:19:47,770
Mr. Chairman, I think there is a site specific question in the chat.

2370
03:19:48,471 --> 03:19:48,991
Oh, I'm sorry.

2371
03:19:52,553 --> 03:19:53,954
from Mr. Chiaramonte.

2372
03:19:53,974 --> 03:19:57,198
Apologies if I misheard that name.

2373
03:19:57,778 --> 03:19:58,999
You want to speak?

2374
03:19:59,119 --> 03:20:08,749
His comment is, was the cell tower on the Elizabeth Grady building taken into consideration when considering this location?

2375
03:20:08,769 --> 03:20:14,655
Mr. Chiaramonte, would you like to speak live?

2376
03:20:22,633 --> 03:20:28,315
Okay, so the question was cell tower on the Elizabeth Grady building taken into consideration when considering this location.

2377
03:20:28,335 --> 03:20:31,816
I'm not familiar with the cell tower on the Elizabeth Grady building.

2378
03:20:33,017 --> 03:20:35,438
Verizon, do you have an answer to that question?

2379
03:20:35,458 --> 03:20:36,458
I'm assuming you did.

2380
03:20:38,019 --> 03:20:48,722
Yeah, I can ask John Fournagle, our RF engineer to address that, but there are antennas on that building, but they do a different thing than this antenna does.

2381
03:20:48,922 --> 03:20:49,863
John will explain it.

2382
03:20:49,883 --> 03:20:50,663
Okay.

2383
03:20:52,573 --> 03:20:53,613
All right, I see those in comments.

2384
03:20:58,654 --> 03:21:00,395
Sorry, is that somebody we need to unmute?

2385
03:21:00,475 --> 03:21:02,095
Is he here?

2386
03:21:02,995 --> 03:21:03,915
Yes, I just unmuted.

2387
03:21:03,935 --> 03:21:04,275
You hear me?

2388
03:21:05,776 --> 03:21:12,937
Yeah, typically, typically that's a that's a rooftop macro, which we generally which we generally don't use for these type of 5G designs.

2389
03:21:19,419 --> 03:21:20,639
Does that increase the

2390
03:21:22,160 --> 03:21:26,484
I don't know, the radio frequency waves and that vicinity or is that?

2391
03:21:28,165 --> 03:21:30,928
No, just it's two different frequency ranges.

2392
03:21:30,968 --> 03:21:42,398
So the frequencies that we're using for these small cells are higher frequencies and they tend to, especially on macro rooftops, they attenuate very, very quickly, especially at heights like this.

2393
03:21:42,418 --> 03:21:48,403
Okay.

2394
03:21:51,640 --> 03:21:58,323
All right, Mr. Tremonti, thank Verizon for the response.

2395
03:21:59,483 --> 03:22:03,285
So if there's no other emails, Dave, I believe you confirmed there wasn't any emails.

2396
03:22:04,685 --> 03:22:08,347
We'll go ahead and any more questions from the committee or motion?

2397
03:22:11,008 --> 03:22:21,352
Motion to approve with the condition around the relocation of the site sign with the approval or with the coordination of the director of traffic.

2398
03:22:22,150 --> 03:22:23,171
Okay, do we have a second?

2399
03:22:23,191 --> 03:22:24,472
Second.

2400
03:22:25,773 --> 03:22:27,234
All right, roll call, Alicia Hunt?

2401
03:22:27,995 --> 03:22:28,275
Yes.

2402
03:22:29,036 --> 03:22:29,536
Paul Mulkey?

2403
03:22:30,117 --> 03:22:30,377
Yes.

2404
03:22:31,298 --> 03:22:32,039
Marian O'Connor?

2405
03:22:32,699 --> 03:22:32,959
Yes.

2406
03:22:33,720 --> 03:22:34,320
Tim McGibbon?

2407
03:22:34,501 --> 03:22:34,701
Yes.

2408
03:22:34,721 --> 03:22:39,105
All right, next one is 16 Mystic Avenue.

2409
03:22:40,906 --> 03:22:41,827
Application number 20.

2410
03:22:43,488 --> 03:22:44,609
Poll ID 717.

2411
03:22:44,830 --> 03:22:46,791
Dave, any emails?

2412
03:22:47,392 --> 03:22:48,192
No emails, Mr. Chair.

2413
03:22:48,232 --> 03:22:49,894
All right.

2414
03:22:52,557 --> 03:22:54,779
I don't see anything coming in from the chat.

2415
03:22:54,959 --> 03:22:55,880
I'll check it again in a minute.

2416
03:23:00,323 --> 03:23:06,908
My review, 57 feet away from a three-story residential building.

2417
03:23:06,928 --> 03:23:11,391
What's the only one I have for that one?

2418
03:23:11,411 --> 03:23:18,596
16 Mississippi Avenue, it's right in front of that building, Alicia, the one the red pin is on.

2419
03:23:19,837 --> 03:23:20,418
It's, yeah.

2420
03:23:23,443 --> 03:23:26,205
And there it is, that yellow sign.

2421
03:23:29,007 --> 03:23:30,128
Nope, not that one, to the left.

2422
03:23:33,270 --> 03:23:33,770
Yeah, that one.

2423
03:23:35,191 --> 03:23:35,932
That one, okay.

2424
03:23:40,014 --> 03:23:42,996
Thank goodness for the mute button or you'd hear me talk twice as much.

2425
03:23:44,237 --> 03:23:46,959
Where's the residential building from there?

2426
03:23:47,319 --> 03:23:49,781
Is there one?

2427
03:23:50,542 --> 03:23:51,102
There is one.

2428
03:23:51,542 --> 03:23:52,203
Okay, thank you.

2429
03:23:52,883 --> 03:23:56,466
57 feet away, three-story residential building.

2430
03:23:56,486 --> 03:23:58,147
So you can see that there in the image.

2431
03:23:59,188 --> 03:24:04,932
This says that the existing top of the pole is 38 feet, six inches.

2432
03:24:06,133 --> 03:24:07,554
And then we'll go above that.

2433
03:24:07,574 --> 03:24:14,199
Okay.

2434
03:24:15,319 --> 03:24:19,843
Oh, is there anything, the existing street sign to be relocated if necessary?

2435
03:24:19,903 --> 03:24:21,104
What is that street sign?

2436
03:24:22,456 --> 03:24:30,881
Oh, this is right before that building in the distance.

2437
03:24:31,161 --> 03:24:33,442
That is our fire headquarters.

2438
03:24:33,743 --> 03:24:36,344
And actually this is our police station right behind it.

2439
03:24:37,365 --> 03:24:37,505
Yeah.

2440
03:24:37,585 --> 03:24:40,947
So I would say similar to that last one, we would want to relocate it.

2441
03:24:40,967 --> 03:24:43,288
We don't have any updated standards for that type of sign.

2442
03:24:43,328 --> 03:24:48,211
So it would just be the same if it's in poor condition, we'd want a new sign.

2443
03:24:48,511 --> 03:24:50,352
But besides that.

2444
03:24:54,130 --> 03:24:56,212
It could be relocating the existing sign.

2445
03:24:57,112 --> 03:24:58,773
Yeah, and it's not like for a crosswalk.

2446
03:24:58,813 --> 03:25:03,217
It's basically an advance warning sign for emergency vehicles entering and exiting.

2447
03:25:03,237 --> 03:25:08,961
So the same general vicinity would be appropriate, probably in front of the pole.

2448
03:25:09,401 --> 03:25:16,886
But again, this is something that we'd want to just, since it's street furniture, we'd want to have it confirmed with the director of traffic.

2449
03:25:19,128 --> 03:25:21,870
If it needs to be relocated.

2450
03:25:26,536 --> 03:25:29,897
can provide some comment on whether it will need to be relocated?

2451
03:25:30,658 --> 03:25:33,879
Yeah, I'm trying to pull the application too, Cynthia says on there.

2452
03:25:37,980 --> 03:25:40,001
Just looking at it, it looks like it would need to be relocated.

2453
03:25:40,021 --> 03:25:44,503
Yeah, I don't recall what the app said.

2454
03:25:44,523 --> 03:25:55,207
The application visually shows the equipment on the other side of the pole and says existing street sign to be relocated if necessary.

2455
03:25:59,260 --> 03:26:02,783
And it appears to be where that box is, the large box.

2456
03:26:03,963 --> 03:26:06,545
Okay, yep, which we're being told is smaller.

2457
03:26:06,565 --> 03:26:21,276
And so, I mean, a similar condition, if it needs to be relocated, if that is the case, then we would want the new location approved by, or coordinated and approved by the director of traffic.

2458
03:26:26,980 --> 03:26:28,921
No, nothing in the chat.

2459
03:26:29,828 --> 03:26:33,891
So we can go ahead and either any additional questions or a motion.

2460
03:26:35,732 --> 03:26:44,279
Motion to approve with the standard conditions and the requirement to relocate the existing sign if necessary.

2461
03:26:44,299 --> 03:26:50,523
If it's necessary to relocate it to coordinate with our director of traffic.

2462
03:26:50,743 --> 03:26:50,883
Yep.

2463
03:26:52,645 --> 03:26:55,707
Do I hear a second?

2464
03:26:56,748 --> 03:26:57,268
Second that.

2465
03:26:58,158 --> 03:26:59,379
All right, roll call vote.

2466
03:26:59,399 --> 03:26:59,879
Alicia Hunt?

2467
03:27:01,240 --> 03:27:01,681
Yes.

2468
03:27:02,261 --> 03:27:02,741
Paul Moki?

2469
03:27:03,362 --> 03:27:03,622
Yes.

2470
03:27:04,203 --> 03:27:04,923
Mary Ann O'Connor?

2471
03:27:05,724 --> 03:27:06,004
Yes.

2472
03:27:06,865 --> 03:27:07,445
Tim McGivern?

2473
03:27:07,625 --> 03:27:07,825
Yes.

2474
03:27:07,845 --> 03:27:13,249
All right, next one is 0 Boston Avenue.

2475
03:27:13,390 --> 03:27:14,450
So that's not an address.

2476
03:27:15,311 --> 03:27:16,132
It's application number 48.

2477
03:27:16,232 --> 03:27:17,272
It is a pole 3310-5.

2478
03:27:17,353 --> 03:27:20,155
And the closest residential building is more than 100 feet away.

2479
03:27:27,166 --> 03:27:29,247
There are no emails on this site, Mr. Chairman.

2480
03:27:29,967 --> 03:27:30,187
Okay.

2481
03:27:30,528 --> 03:27:32,248
I don't see anything in the chat.

2482
03:27:34,209 --> 03:27:35,270
So there you have it.

2483
03:27:35,530 --> 03:27:46,796
Just so folks can orient themselves, the new T station is across the street from this pole and the brand new Tufts power plant building is the closest building.

2484
03:27:48,076 --> 03:27:51,878
So I would imagine that more disruption is going to come from that power plant building.

2485
03:28:18,753 --> 03:28:23,076
Sorry, so there appears to be two poles next to each other.

2486
03:28:23,096 --> 03:28:28,380
It appears to be not the one with the signage according to the application, but the other one, is that correct?

2487
03:28:29,781 --> 03:28:30,661
Sounds familiar.

2488
03:28:30,681 --> 03:28:34,924
I'm just going to double check in here.

2489
03:28:35,745 --> 03:28:36,145
Yeah.

2490
03:28:36,185 --> 03:28:36,365
Okay.

2491
03:28:36,445 --> 03:28:45,051
The top of the existing utility pole is 34 feet, seven inches, and the equipment would go above that around 37 feet.

2492
03:28:53,723 --> 03:28:55,043
We do have a question.

2493
03:28:55,183 --> 03:28:57,764
Will this be the same equipment as the others?

2494
03:28:58,804 --> 03:29:01,924
I believe the answer is yes.

2495
03:29:02,545 --> 03:29:08,546
All of the applications I did confirm at the first hearing is all the same equipment.

2496
03:29:10,726 --> 03:29:11,246
Okay.

2497
03:29:16,367 --> 03:29:19,648
Do we have any other, anything from the email Dave?

2498
03:29:19,978 --> 03:29:21,759
Did I already ask that?

2499
03:29:21,799 --> 03:29:25,843
Nothing in the email, Mr. Chairman, but there are some specific questions in the chat from Mr. Nazaro.

2500
03:29:26,583 --> 03:29:26,844
Okay.

2501
03:29:27,264 --> 03:29:30,727
The question was actually that, will this equipment be the same as the others?

2502
03:29:31,247 --> 03:29:32,008
So we got that.

2503
03:29:32,748 --> 03:29:43,857
It's asking if it's handling more data potentially, same power density, and I'll ask Verizon to confirm this, but I believe it's all the same equipment that is being proposed on all of these polls.

2504
03:29:45,759 --> 03:29:47,120
So it's no different from the other ones.

2505
03:29:47,380 --> 03:29:48,221
Can I please have that confirmed?

2506
03:29:49,645 --> 03:29:50,285
That would be correct.

2507
03:29:50,306 --> 03:29:51,306
Okay, thank you.

2508
03:29:56,970 --> 03:30:01,114
The three antennas, they are tri antennas, so they face in three directions.

2509
03:30:04,096 --> 03:30:07,999
Thank you, Mr. Nazaro.

2510
03:30:08,459 --> 03:30:09,220
Motions from the committee?

2511
03:30:10,440 --> 03:30:12,542
Motion to approve with our standard conditions.

2512
03:30:13,022 --> 03:30:14,443
Okay, do we hear a second?

2513
03:30:16,205 --> 03:30:16,485
Second.

2514
03:30:17,860 --> 03:30:19,020
All right, roll call vote.

2515
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:19,540
Malisha Hunt.

2516
03:30:21,701 --> 03:30:22,001
Yes.

2517
03:30:23,341 --> 03:30:23,761
Paul Mulkey.

2518
03:30:24,621 --> 03:30:24,861
Yes.

2519
03:30:26,061 --> 03:30:26,722
Mary Ann O'Connor.

2520
03:30:28,022 --> 03:30:28,342
Yes.

2521
03:30:29,282 --> 03:30:30,102
Tim McGivern, yes.

2522
03:30:34,043 --> 03:30:36,363
All right, next one is 97 Greenleaf Avenue.

2523
03:30:37,603 --> 03:30:39,604
This is application 11, poll number 3755.

2524
03:30:39,644 --> 03:30:47,365
Do not receive any emails for this location, Mr. Chairman.

2525
03:30:48,130 --> 03:30:51,231
Thank you.

2526
03:30:51,351 --> 03:30:52,392
University was notified.

2527
03:30:52,572 --> 03:30:52,772
Yes.

2528
03:30:53,692 --> 03:30:54,873
All right.

2529
03:30:56,454 --> 03:30:58,374
So this one has an existing double pole.

2530
03:30:58,875 --> 03:31:02,296
I would like Verizon to confirm that it's an in process double pole.

2531
03:31:03,377 --> 03:31:08,119
We do have a condition just to remind everybody that, and it's in the policy that they can't go on double pole.

2532
03:31:08,159 --> 03:31:11,880
So that would have to be complete before this.

2533
03:31:12,020 --> 03:31:15,322
And obviously the concrete collar at the base would need to be repaired.

2534
03:31:16,352 --> 03:31:18,854
as per the standard conditions we've already created.

2535
03:31:20,835 --> 03:31:22,496
The pole is actually in the Burgett Ave right of way.

2536
03:31:23,877 --> 03:31:26,519
And within 30 feet is a three-story dwelling.

2537
03:31:32,683 --> 03:31:33,263
Yeah, that's it.

2538
03:31:34,744 --> 03:31:36,806
So it looks like it's an in-process pole switch.

2539
03:31:37,206 --> 03:31:44,511
So just so folks understand what happens with utility poles, if a owner of a pole is going to replace the pole,

2540
03:31:45,370 --> 03:31:55,353
they put the new one in, and then they have all of their VCs move the equipment from one pole to another over a certain period of time.

2541
03:31:56,213 --> 03:32:00,354
And then once that is complete, they remove the old pole and finish setting the new pole.

2542
03:32:01,515 --> 03:32:04,175
That's a really rough outline of the process.

2543
03:32:04,615 --> 03:32:06,836
And this one looks like it's mid process.

2544
03:32:08,857 --> 03:32:11,017
So just want to confirm that with Verizon.

2545
03:32:11,898 --> 03:32:13,298
How long does that usually take to

2546
03:32:14,084 --> 03:32:17,228
It could take anywhere from a few weeks to many months.

2547
03:32:17,508 --> 03:32:22,053
It usually depends on the leases on the poll.

2548
03:32:22,333 --> 03:32:30,622
You know, sometimes there are wires, services that poll owners sometimes have trouble coordinating with, and that's just the truth of it.

2549
03:32:32,084 --> 03:32:32,184
So.

2550
03:32:32,404 --> 03:32:35,708
I mean, it take years to get the second poll removed.

2551
03:32:37,021 --> 03:32:40,742
Sometimes there have been cases where it's been way too long years.

2552
03:32:40,762 --> 03:32:45,383
It's, you know, I'm trying to move a poll in tough square and it's, you know, we had a brutal time of it.

2553
03:32:46,483 --> 03:32:49,944
So, you know, but that's why- There's an editorial comment, Mr. Chairman.

2554
03:32:49,984 --> 03:32:53,604
There is a requirement under state law to have the double poll moved after 90 days.

2555
03:32:54,344 --> 03:32:55,465
That is never enforced.

2556
03:32:55,685 --> 03:32:57,445
It's not unenforceable at the municipal level.

2557
03:32:57,485 --> 03:33:01,926
It has to be enforced at the state level, but it's never enforced by DPU.

2558
03:33:02,626 --> 03:33:03,547
Yeah, sounds about right.

2559
03:33:04,267 --> 03:33:11,791
But we can enforce here that the new equipment, the double pole has to come out before this new equipment can go on.

2560
03:33:14,293 --> 03:33:22,837
And there's one of our conditions is the one year on the thing, which will help Verizon help us get rid of these double poles in these locations.

2561
03:33:25,759 --> 03:33:25,899
Yeah.

2562
03:33:27,318 --> 03:33:33,741
Again, I just want to keep pointing out, this is another example of the city maintaining what little control we have here.

2563
03:33:34,501 --> 03:33:50,488
So just- So I'm assuming that because the application said top of existing utility pole, 29, three feet, and the new pole would be 34 feet, that what we're seeing here is the old 29 and the new 34.

2564
03:33:50,568 --> 03:33:54,250
That would be consistent with my understanding as well, Alicia.

2565
03:33:56,240 --> 03:33:58,121
Yeah, this would be the new pole, yeah.

2566
03:33:58,902 --> 03:34:00,783
So the old 29 will come out.

2567
03:34:01,784 --> 03:34:01,984
Yeah.

2568
03:34:02,764 --> 03:34:05,326
And the new 34, it would be built on top of the new 34.

2569
03:34:05,366 --> 03:34:05,646
Mm-hmm.

2570
03:34:05,706 --> 03:34:10,229
That would be higher than 34 feet.

2571
03:34:12,291 --> 03:34:13,932
Yeah, it'll start then at 35.

2572
03:34:14,092 --> 03:34:21,297
It says the center line of the antennas will be at 36 feet, six inches, and the top is at 37.

2573
03:34:21,437 --> 03:34:22,918
I'm gonna do math.

2574
03:34:24,561 --> 03:34:32,606
put into, so 35, the bottom of the antenna would be at 35 feet 4 inches.

2575
03:34:35,927 --> 03:34:36,268
Thank you.

2576
03:34:37,388 --> 03:34:37,628
Yeah.

2577
03:34:39,729 --> 03:34:42,171
I don't see the map at this hour.

2578
03:34:42,191 --> 03:34:44,232
I don't do anything in the chat.

2579
03:34:46,024 --> 03:34:54,369
And I don't know if Verizon, if you could confirm that this is in process and this is the new poll in process of the switch out, if you know that.

2580
03:34:54,910 --> 03:34:56,290
That is correct.

2581
03:34:56,711 --> 03:34:57,311
Okay, thank you.

2582
03:34:58,332 --> 03:35:01,433
All right, any other questions or emotions from the committee?

2583
03:35:07,877 --> 03:35:11,239
Motion to approve this location with outstanding conditions.

2584
03:35:12,220 --> 03:35:13,060
Okay, do we have a second?

2585
03:35:14,922 --> 03:35:15,242
Second.

2586
03:35:16,581 --> 03:35:17,782
All right, roll call vote.

2587
03:35:17,862 --> 03:35:18,322
Alicia Hunt?

2588
03:35:19,323 --> 03:35:19,623
Yes.

2589
03:35:20,684 --> 03:35:21,164
Paul Moki?

2590
03:35:21,865 --> 03:35:22,165
Yes.

2591
03:35:23,266 --> 03:35:23,986
Mary Ann O'Connor?

2592
03:35:24,587 --> 03:35:24,887
Yes.

2593
03:35:25,888 --> 03:35:26,388
Tim McGibbon?

2594
03:35:26,508 --> 03:35:26,708
Yes.

2595
03:35:28,450 --> 03:35:30,211
Next one is 110 Winthrop Street.

2596
03:35:31,552 --> 03:35:32,112
Application 012.

2597
03:35:32,813 --> 03:35:38,917
Poll number 5935 or poll ID 5935.

2598
03:35:40,839 --> 03:35:46,423
And the relevant measurement I have for this one is a three-story dwelling is within 40 horizontal feet.

2599
03:35:49,044 --> 03:35:51,025
And we do have an email for this location, Mr. Chair.

2600
03:35:52,145 --> 03:35:53,506
Okay, you can go ahead and read that.

2601
03:35:54,086 --> 03:35:59,408
I was received from celibam at hotmail.com, Tim Tamara.

2602
03:36:00,228 --> 03:36:02,329
This poll is close to houses on both sides of the street.

2603
03:36:02,910 --> 03:36:09,552
If you are making conditions, it's my understanding after speaking to Alicia, she stated the city council didn't vote in for April, 2019.

2604
03:36:10,092 --> 03:36:14,354
So no new conditions and residential dwellings will not be included in the original 44 applications.

2605
03:36:14,914 --> 03:36:16,355
That was a verbatim recitation.

2606
03:36:17,652 --> 03:36:18,192
Okay, thank you.

2607
03:36:18,532 --> 03:36:19,933
It sounded correct.

2608
03:36:20,253 --> 03:36:24,675
Okay, let me check the chat.

2609
03:36:26,176 --> 03:36:27,256
Okay, nothing new in the chat.

2610
03:36:32,398 --> 03:36:34,519
Sorry, I lost my orientation here.

2611
03:36:45,661 --> 03:36:47,121
All right, so it's this.

2612
03:37:02,805 --> 03:37:03,225
Do we?

2613
03:37:07,006 --> 03:37:08,807
I may need help orienting this one.

2614
03:37:08,987 --> 03:37:10,547
Yeah, down the street a little bit, I believe.

2615
03:37:10,947 --> 03:37:11,427
Is this it here?

2616
03:37:15,418 --> 03:37:27,028
I believe so, yes.

2617
03:37:27,448 --> 03:37:35,535
Looking at this, the proposed top of the utility pole would be 38 feet, six inches.

2618
03:37:45,854 --> 03:37:48,076
to be on top of 38, is that what they're saying?

2619
03:37:48,296 --> 03:37:49,517
Yeah, yes.

2620
03:37:56,102 --> 03:37:56,382
All right.

2621
03:37:57,463 --> 03:38:01,306
All right, any other questions, comments, motions?

2622
03:38:05,069 --> 03:38:07,291
Motion to approve with our standard conditions.

2623
03:38:08,952 --> 03:38:09,573
Do I hear a second?

2624
03:38:10,153 --> 03:38:10,313
Oh.

2625
03:38:12,755 --> 03:38:15,037
Sorry, I think Councilor Marks is raising his hand.

2626
03:38:20,451 --> 03:38:21,352
Councilor Marks, okay.

2627
03:38:22,513 --> 03:38:23,153
Councilor Marks.

2628
03:38:24,554 --> 03:38:25,115
Thank you, Tim.

2629
03:38:25,655 --> 03:38:29,458
I just want to make sure what I heard was what I heard.

2630
03:38:30,619 --> 03:38:40,948
Did you state that the city council did not vote in April of 2019 to add dwellings and that's why it was not added?

2631
03:38:41,628 --> 03:38:42,769
Is that what you stated?

2632
03:38:43,010 --> 03:38:49,515
I have to tell you, I had no understanding of what that letter, it did not make any sense to me.

2633
03:38:50,886 --> 03:38:54,910
Okay, I wouldn't know what the city council voted in April of 2019.

2634
03:38:57,913 --> 03:38:59,374
Just if I can clarify, Tim.

2635
03:38:59,875 --> 03:39:00,496
Sure, please do.

2636
03:39:00,516 --> 03:39:00,676
Yep.

2637
03:39:01,016 --> 03:39:02,438
It was this inside a customer.

2638
03:39:02,458 --> 03:39:04,460
This is in reference to the comment that was read via email.

2639
03:39:04,500 --> 03:39:04,740
Correct.

2640
03:39:05,220 --> 03:39:05,400
Right.

2641
03:39:05,501 --> 03:39:13,809
And I received one as well, stating that Alicia mentioned that this was going to take place in the neighborhood because

2642
03:39:14,333 --> 03:39:20,896
the fact that the city council did not add dwellings to the interim policy.

2643
03:39:21,416 --> 03:39:25,198
And as we all know, the city council does not create policy.

2644
03:39:25,658 --> 03:39:28,679
The interim policy was created by the previous administration.

2645
03:39:29,299 --> 03:39:41,725
And this council has been on record for the past two years, offering at least a half a dozen recommendations to the both city administrations, the previous one and this current one to update

2646
03:39:42,165 --> 03:39:43,706
the current interim policy.

2647
03:39:44,127 --> 03:39:49,110
So I just want to set the record straight, because what Alicia mentioned is totally incorrect.

2648
03:39:49,450 --> 03:39:50,171
This is a record.

2649
03:39:50,331 --> 03:39:52,333
That's the letter that the butter wrote.

2650
03:39:52,353 --> 03:39:55,615
They must have understood something that I said to them.

2651
03:39:56,255 --> 03:40:00,719
Okay, well, you just reiterated when they said it, you said it was the city council.

2652
03:40:01,279 --> 03:40:05,843
So apparently, they didn't misunderstand, because you just reiterated what the letter said.

2653
03:40:06,383 --> 03:40:11,727
So unless unless I'm hearing wrong, you did clear you cleared the record.

2654
03:40:12,683 --> 03:40:13,964
I think Council Member Archie cleared the record.

2655
03:40:15,826 --> 03:40:18,468
So the statement was read from the email.

2656
03:40:19,309 --> 03:40:21,791
You responded and clarified the record, and I appreciate that.

2657
03:40:22,451 --> 03:40:25,894
Okay, and if I could just add, Tim, it is almost 10.30.

2658
03:40:27,447 --> 03:40:29,849
We're going on the same slope we did last week.

2659
03:40:30,370 --> 03:40:36,795
We still have residents with their hands up that have been on the meeting for three and a half hours about their property.

2660
03:40:38,036 --> 03:40:41,499
And with all due respect, I think this meeting should come to an end.

2661
03:40:41,899 --> 03:40:45,222
And I think we should hear from those few residents that have their hands up.

2662
03:40:45,827 --> 03:40:46,147
I agree.

2663
03:40:46,207 --> 03:40:59,410
So the two people who have their hands up, Miss Jordan and Miss Kendall, I know they want to speak on one on one Sheridan, which and I acknowledge that it's 1030 was the time that we ran out of steam last time.

2664
03:40:59,430 --> 03:41:01,510
I'm probably going to run out of steam then.

2665
03:41:02,630 --> 03:41:05,031
We've made some we've made some progress on the agenda.

2666
03:41:06,071 --> 03:41:06,771
So noted.

2667
03:41:06,791 --> 03:41:07,531
Okay.

2668
03:41:08,171 --> 03:41:08,691
Very much so.

2669
03:41:09,591 --> 03:41:10,772
I run out of steam at some point.

2670
03:41:11,312 --> 03:41:11,432
So

2671
03:41:13,774 --> 03:41:15,655
I want to try to get through as many as I can.

2672
03:41:15,675 --> 03:41:26,522
Okay, so I would because of this, I mean I will say if I'm Miss Jordan and Miss Kendall I know you have wanted to speak on one on one Sheridan.

2673
03:41:27,142 --> 03:41:30,044
And in the interest of time that you've been waiting.

2674
03:41:30,464 --> 03:41:32,065
I think it is a good idea to hear you now.

2675
03:41:33,506 --> 03:41:46,114
And Mr. Chairman, with respect to one-on-one sharing, and there are a number of emails as it relates to that, it may make sense to take that item out of order and advance that item if there's a number of public input on that one.

2676
03:41:46,794 --> 03:41:47,995
That is a good suggestion.

2677
03:41:48,015 --> 03:41:52,618
Do I hear a motion from the committee to take that out of order?

2678
03:41:53,719 --> 03:41:55,180
Motion to take it out of order.

2679
03:41:56,060 --> 03:41:57,221
Tim, can I just clarify?

2680
03:41:57,241 --> 03:42:00,143
I think one went for if you hadn't voted yet.

2681
03:42:01,426 --> 03:42:02,906
want to finish unless I missed it.

2682
03:42:03,106 --> 03:42:03,626
I apologize.

2683
03:42:03,766 --> 03:42:04,527
Oh, I'm sorry.

2684
03:42:04,547 --> 03:42:05,047
I'm sorry.

2685
03:42:05,067 --> 03:42:05,607
You're correct.

2686
03:42:05,647 --> 03:42:08,628
Here's an indication that I'm running out of steam.

2687
03:42:08,908 --> 03:42:09,448
You are correct.

2688
03:42:09,488 --> 03:42:11,748
We haven't voted on this one yet.

2689
03:42:11,768 --> 03:42:12,908
So let's close this one out.

2690
03:42:13,229 --> 03:42:15,429
And then we'll go to we'll go to that one.

2691
03:42:16,229 --> 03:42:17,549
Okay, so I didn't.

2692
03:42:18,490 --> 03:42:20,130
Dave, any emails on 110 Winthrop Street?

2693
03:42:20,150 --> 03:42:22,270
I believe you confirmed there wasn't but just double check.

2694
03:42:25,151 --> 03:42:27,472
There was the empty the message that was read.

2695
03:42:27,932 --> 03:42:29,592
Oh, yeah, the message that was read.

2696
03:42:30,575 --> 03:42:31,976
More indications I'm running out of steam.

2697
03:42:33,356 --> 03:42:34,137
Yeah, okay.

2698
03:42:34,657 --> 03:42:39,379
So I read that, my measurement.

2699
03:42:39,660 --> 03:42:43,862
I think we're at any more comments from the committee or motions?

2700
03:42:45,943 --> 03:42:49,485
Motion to approve 110 Winter Street with standard conditions.

2701
03:42:50,385 --> 03:42:52,086
Okay, hear a second?

2702
03:42:53,406 --> 03:42:53,847
Second.

2703
03:42:54,947 --> 03:42:56,128
All right, roll call, Alicia Hunt?

2704
03:42:56,908 --> 03:42:57,148
Yes.

2705
03:42:58,529 --> 03:42:59,009
Paul Moki?

2706
03:42:59,730 --> 03:42:59,970
Yes.

2707
03:43:01,234 --> 03:43:01,954
Marianne O'Connor?

2708
03:43:02,655 --> 03:43:02,935
Yes.

2709
03:43:03,556 --> 03:43:04,596
Me, Tim McGibbon, yes.

2710
03:43:06,678 --> 03:43:13,162
Do I hear a motion to take 101 Sheridan Avenue out of order in respect to the residents that have been waiting to speak?

2711
03:43:14,203 --> 03:43:14,743
So moved.

2712
03:43:15,643 --> 03:43:16,104
So moved.

2713
03:43:16,304 --> 03:43:16,644
Second.

2714
03:43:16,664 --> 03:43:18,786
Okay, we'll call vote.

2715
03:43:18,806 --> 03:43:19,246
Alicia Hunt?

2716
03:43:21,727 --> 03:43:21,948
Yes.

2717
03:43:22,928 --> 03:43:23,409
Paul Moki?

2718
03:43:24,009 --> 03:43:24,249
Yes.

2719
03:43:25,410 --> 03:43:26,050
Marianne O'Connor?

2720
03:43:26,651 --> 03:43:26,891
Yes.

2721
03:43:28,102 --> 03:43:28,942
Tim McGibbon, yes.

2722
03:43:29,643 --> 03:43:34,444
All right, we're gonna go to 101 Sheridan.

2723
03:43:34,464 --> 03:43:39,506
101 Sheridan Avenue, application number 29, poll number 1510.

2724
03:43:42,941 --> 03:43:49,668
And I have a record of conversation with Barbara Kendall, who also would like to speak.

2725
03:43:50,949 --> 03:43:58,937
And she's opposed to the request and request that we deny the application, and she would like to know if it can be moved.

2726
03:43:59,938 --> 03:44:02,961
And we will have her speak right after I read my measurements.

2727
03:44:04,531 --> 03:44:09,577
The antenna is within 24 feet of two three-story residential buildings.

2728
03:44:09,838 --> 03:44:13,743
It's also 60 feet within two other three-story buildings.

2729
03:44:15,024 --> 03:44:17,548
All right, and we will go to Ms.

2730
03:44:17,588 --> 03:44:17,928
Kendall.

2731
03:44:18,609 --> 03:44:19,650
Hello, Ms.

2732
03:44:19,691 --> 03:44:19,971
Kendall.

2733
03:44:25,028 --> 03:44:31,035
Hi, can you fix that picture because you're not getting a very good idea of the location of that pole.

2734
03:44:32,276 --> 03:44:33,598
Can you can you pull it.

2735
03:44:34,759 --> 03:44:40,725
So you can see street level I want you to be able to see the, the two houses that are most directly affected here can you fix that.

2736
03:44:41,815 --> 03:44:42,796
picture that I'm looking at.

2737
03:44:42,816 --> 03:44:44,937
First, is that the right pole?

2738
03:44:44,957 --> 03:44:46,758
Are we looking at the right one?

2739
03:44:47,638 --> 03:44:48,038
Go down.

2740
03:44:48,078 --> 03:44:50,980
See the pole that's standing right there smack dab in the middle?

2741
03:44:51,700 --> 03:44:55,442
There's a pole standing by the roof.

2742
03:44:55,862 --> 03:44:56,863
Can you bring this up?

2743
03:44:57,043 --> 03:44:58,223
I want it to go like this.

2744
03:44:58,824 --> 03:45:00,705
All right, so there's the pole, okay?

2745
03:45:01,945 --> 03:45:04,246
see that little white van?

2746
03:45:04,486 --> 03:45:05,246
There's the pole.

2747
03:45:05,266 --> 03:45:07,047
Oops, I'm going to do it again.

2748
03:45:07,067 --> 03:45:08,107
There's the pole.

2749
03:45:08,607 --> 03:45:12,008
This is my house to the right by that tree.

2750
03:45:12,489 --> 03:45:19,591
And I have, this is a really, really small lot with a shared driveway and a side yard of less than three feet.

2751
03:45:19,651 --> 03:45:23,212
There is only four feet from that pole

2752
03:45:23,592 --> 03:45:24,433
to my front walk.

2753
03:45:24,453 --> 03:45:26,074
Can you see the little portion there?

2754
03:45:26,134 --> 03:45:27,235
This is my front door.

2755
03:45:27,535 --> 03:45:28,856
This is my sidewalk.

2756
03:45:28,896 --> 03:45:29,856
There's no side yard.

2757
03:45:29,896 --> 03:45:33,479
There's no buffer zone between these two houses.

2758
03:45:33,599 --> 03:45:35,200
It's smack dab on top of me.

2759
03:45:35,620 --> 03:45:46,908
Now I went and looked at the other 10 site locations listed for Medford Square in the Greendale area and most of them like on Forest Street have frontages or side yards about 50 feet

2760
03:45:47,568 --> 03:45:52,109
They're on a corner, they're in front of or next to commercial buildings, which act as buffers.

2761
03:45:52,249 --> 03:45:53,089
I don't have that.

2762
03:45:53,349 --> 03:46:04,792
When I sit on my front porch as you can see right there, I'm looking smack dab at that pole and my bedroom was on the second floor, and I'm right in a direct line with that telephone pole.

2763
03:46:05,312 --> 03:46:06,632
So, for me, this.

2764
03:46:09,493 --> 03:46:15,999
This post directly in front of my bedroom window, and on many levels it's going to interfere with the enjoyment of my home.

2765
03:46:16,379 --> 03:46:28,250
I like to sit on my front porch and the only time I don't sit there on that I sit on that side where the pole is, and I sit there all year, except for the winter when it's

2766
03:46:28,490 --> 03:46:29,510
when it's really snowing.

2767
03:46:29,570 --> 03:46:40,555
But as far as I'm concerned, with the amount of equipment that's going on that pole, and there's already a tremendous amount of equipment on that pole, this tower will be an eyesore.

2768
03:46:40,575 --> 03:46:45,898
And in your policy, it says you're supposed to do something that's aesthetically pleasing.

2769
03:46:45,978 --> 03:46:47,999
Well, it's not going to be aesthetically pleasing.

2770
03:46:48,059 --> 03:46:52,101
It's all going to be exposed, and it's going to be staring me in the face no matter where I look.

2771
03:46:52,161 --> 03:46:56,803
When I get out of my bed in the morning, the first thing I'm going to see is this eyesore of a pole.

2772
03:46:57,223 --> 03:46:59,304
Now, they also said they're going to put cooling fans.

2773
03:46:59,364 --> 03:47:07,429
So that means I'm going to have humming noise or some kind of a whine that I'm going to hear every morning and every night when I go to bed.

2774
03:47:07,930 --> 03:47:16,815
So because it is extremely close proximity, I don't think this is not going to increase the value of my home.

2775
03:47:16,875 --> 03:47:19,036
If anything, it's going to make my value go down.

2776
03:47:19,316 --> 03:47:20,337
Right now, it's valued at $600,000.

2777
03:47:21,898 --> 03:47:29,701
With that pole and the cell tower on top of it, if I try to sell this people are going to look at and say I don't want this house, I'll be lucky if I get 300,000 for it.

2778
03:47:30,121 --> 03:47:36,784
I really feel that this should not be approved, and I looked at other air houses of poles in the area.

2779
03:47:37,504 --> 03:47:41,885
If you go down to Stevens Square, which is a commercial area, you have Citizens Bank.

2780
03:47:42,505 --> 03:47:44,346
That's on Yeoman's Ave.

2781
03:47:44,426 --> 03:47:46,606
It has a pole in front of citizens.

2782
03:47:47,226 --> 03:47:50,507
It has a pole in back of their parking lot.

2783
03:47:50,827 --> 03:47:53,128
And it has one across the street that's in their parking lot.

2784
03:47:53,188 --> 03:47:54,168
And there's nothing on them.

2785
03:47:54,228 --> 03:47:55,328
There's no transformers.

2786
03:47:55,368 --> 03:47:56,729
There's no extra equipment.

2787
03:47:57,229 --> 03:48:03,670
So when you looked at the corner of Grant, Dudley, and Revere Place, those poles have nothing on them.

2788
03:48:03,690 --> 03:48:06,251
They're towards the end, and they're in the commercial areas.

2789
03:48:06,627 --> 03:48:16,590
So my concern is that you've taken a lovely residential area, you stuck the coal in the middle of it, it doesn't enhance the neighborhood, if anything, it detracts from it.

2790
03:48:16,690 --> 03:48:29,493
So I would hope that you would look at this and feel, okay, we're destroying a neighborhood, let's not put it there, let's put it at the top of Sheridan Ave on Salem Street, which is in the commercial area, put it on Dudley Street.

2791
03:48:29,913 --> 03:48:42,600
put it on Grant Ave, because there's a restaurant right there at the corner of Grant Ave, put it on the Spring Street where the Citizens Bank is, Yeoman's Ave, rather than smack dab in the middle of Sheridan Ave.

2792
03:48:43,640 --> 03:48:45,181
Okay, I guess that's all I have to say.

2793
03:48:45,241 --> 03:48:47,302
It's very distressing to look at this poll.

2794
03:48:48,062 --> 03:48:49,943
Thank you very much for your comments.

2795
03:48:50,303 --> 03:48:52,405
And we will go to Miss Jordan.

2796
03:48:52,825 --> 03:48:58,127
And Miss Jordan is asking about a petition that was signed by 34 homeowners

2797
03:48:59,705 --> 03:49:02,447
against the 5G cell tower on Sheridan Avenue.

2798
03:49:02,847 --> 03:49:04,628
Dave, did that come in in the emails?

2799
03:49:05,608 --> 03:49:06,629
It did, Mr. Chairman.

2800
03:49:06,649 --> 03:49:11,272
There was a number of emails that were received with respect to this site.

2801
03:49:11,852 --> 03:49:12,712
There are a number from Ms.

2802
03:49:12,732 --> 03:49:17,115
Kendall, including two letters that were received from her.

2803
03:49:17,735 --> 03:49:25,960
I generally state the positions that she already spoke of in person or through the Zoom.

2804
03:49:27,426 --> 03:49:34,150
There also was a petition that was signed by a number of individuals in the Sheridan Avenue neighborhood.

2805
03:49:34,791 --> 03:49:44,658
Those, I suggest those both of those documents be included into the record into the minutes of the record of the committee.

2806
03:49:45,578 --> 03:49:47,839
and they are publicly, and so they'll be publicly available.

2807
03:49:47,879 --> 03:49:54,122
They are available to the committee members to view via the 5G comments mailbox.

2808
03:49:54,982 --> 03:50:04,206
There was also emails received from Marilana Tetchy Bariola from 62 Sheridan Ave to whom it may concern.

2809
03:50:04,306 --> 03:50:09,649
I was unable to attend last night's meeting regarding the plan to place 5G network equipment on the utility poles in the city.

2810
03:50:10,169 --> 03:50:12,170
I received notification that one will be placed

2811
03:50:13,385 --> 03:50:16,007
One will be placed on a pole 300 feet from my home.

2812
03:50:16,467 --> 03:50:17,889
I do not want this near my home.

2813
03:50:18,369 --> 03:50:22,412
It has been banned in cities and countries across the globe due to adverse health effects.

2814
03:50:22,832 --> 03:50:24,594
We are already dealing with a health crisis.

2815
03:50:24,954 --> 03:50:27,636
Please consider the negative impact this will have many in our city.

2816
03:50:28,117 --> 03:50:31,059
Signed, Marilyn Atechi Bariola, 62, Sheridan Ave.

2817
03:50:32,820 --> 03:50:36,263
There was a email received from Marlene Seymour.

2818
03:50:36,899 --> 03:50:40,402
I am emailing you today as a concerned resident of Sheridan Ave.

2819
03:50:40,482 --> 03:50:45,326
My parents are owners of two family home at 89 Sheridan Ave, just shy of four years.

2820
03:50:45,906 --> 03:50:53,272
The five adult family members that resign at that address as well as many neighbors are opposed to 5G cell towers that are being placed on Sheridan Ave.

2821
03:50:53,753 --> 03:50:55,874
In fact, I know there was a petition in place for this matter.

2822
03:50:56,435 --> 03:51:00,598
I would like to know how we were able to address our concerns further and see if this is not getting the green light.

2823
03:51:01,138 --> 03:51:02,920
I can be reached at her email address

2824
03:51:03,557 --> 03:51:04,698
or at her telephone number.

2825
03:51:04,758 --> 03:51:11,302
You may, in the email, the phone number of her parents, Brendan and Arthur Seymour, signed Marlene Seymour.

2826
03:51:11,942 --> 03:51:15,724
There was an additional email received from Cheryl Montecalvo.

2827
03:51:16,205 --> 03:51:20,767
I'm writing to say I do not want the 5G network on or near the Sheridan Ave area.

2828
03:51:21,227 --> 03:51:21,588
Thank you.

2829
03:51:21,668 --> 03:51:23,309
Any questions, please call her home.

2830
03:51:23,989 --> 03:51:28,712
Richard and Cheryl Montecalvo, I'm unable to attend the meeting due to work and health.

2831
03:51:31,742 --> 03:51:33,243
Second, I'll follow up email from Ms.

2832
03:51:33,283 --> 03:51:38,344
Maltekova in regards to the first email I neglected to add their names, which were stated.

2833
03:51:39,165 --> 03:51:44,666
And that is the context of the comments for one-on-one sharing.

2834
03:51:46,527 --> 03:51:46,767
Thank you.

2835
03:51:51,875 --> 03:51:55,918
Mr. Chair, can we address the analysis for this site?

2836
03:51:56,879 --> 03:52:01,062
And also note for the record, there are no fans that would be on these installations.

2837
03:52:02,884 --> 03:52:03,784
Yeah, thank you, Mike.

2838
03:52:04,205 --> 03:52:05,225
That is correct.

2839
03:52:05,245 --> 03:52:06,006
We confirmed that.

2840
03:52:06,887 --> 03:52:08,568
That was a concern with noise.

2841
03:52:09,008 --> 03:52:12,371
There are no fans, and that was confirmed by Verizon a couple of times.

2842
03:52:13,071 --> 03:52:14,712
So please go ahead and address what you wanted to address.

2843
03:52:14,753 --> 03:52:15,013
Thank you.

2844
03:52:16,814 --> 03:52:18,015
Sean will address this.

2845
03:52:21,582 --> 03:52:21,882
Thanks, Mike.

2846
03:52:23,043 --> 03:52:27,005
So Alicia, if you want to kind of go up the street a little bit, we selected this pole.

2847
03:52:28,686 --> 03:52:30,907
It was the best pole for us to use in the area.

2848
03:52:31,347 --> 03:52:38,331
If you go up to that next pole on the street with a, oh, if you want to go that way, that's fine too.

2849
03:52:38,371 --> 03:52:46,316
You can see that next pole has a, this one has the risers on it, so we can't use that one.

2850
03:52:47,497 --> 03:52:49,197
And then if you go to the next one, it's,

2851
03:52:50,482 --> 03:52:51,723
Get the same equipment up top.

2852
03:52:55,545 --> 03:53:02,188
So, you know, we're, we're moving within now three poles down the street from the RF coverage objective.

2853
03:53:06,151 --> 03:53:08,992
And if you're able to go the other way up the street, you'll see.

2854
03:53:09,012 --> 03:53:13,254
The next poll is going to have a transformer on it.

2855
03:53:13,655 --> 03:53:18,037
And then the next poll after that's going to have a, uh, the primary reclosures on it.

2856
03:53:20,665 --> 03:53:23,307
Okay, so that's the transformer, is that correct?

2857
03:53:25,409 --> 03:53:25,769
The garbage can?

2858
03:53:25,789 --> 03:53:27,050
That's the transformer, correct.

2859
03:53:31,914 --> 03:53:38,839
And then actually, if you go, if you turn around here, the next pole... This one looks empty.

2860
03:53:40,120 --> 03:53:41,321
That's the pole we're going on.

2861
03:53:42,182 --> 03:53:44,564
That's the one we've been talking about, okay.

2862
03:53:45,545 --> 03:53:49,328
Right, and then if you go the other way, I think you can see that next pole there has a...

2863
03:53:49,895 --> 03:53:52,137
has a transformer, so we can't attach there.

2864
03:53:52,157 --> 03:54:00,384
And the next pole, after that's gonna have some reclosure equipment at the top of the pole.

2865
03:54:01,906 --> 03:54:03,767
So why is this street necessary?

2866
03:54:08,912 --> 03:54:16,519
John, I have to pass it off to you to just explain a little bit about the network and why we needed coverage in this area.

2867
03:54:20,415 --> 03:54:27,941
Yeah, from an RF perspective, we need to kind of get coverage down in this area and we need to hand off to the other sites that we're planning in the network.

2868
03:54:28,962 --> 03:54:33,986
So the site was needed to really, you know, match coverage throughout the entire area.

2869
03:54:34,426 --> 03:54:44,415
And on Sean's point, if we move further north or further south, after we get past the poles that we can't use, it really just starts to overlap with other sites that we're using.

2870
03:54:45,095 --> 03:54:48,558
And, you know, pretty much like the whole design would wind up, you know,

2871
03:54:49,392 --> 03:54:52,214
becoming null, really, or moot.

2872
03:55:06,904 --> 03:55:17,472
So I know folks are concerned with health impacts, but I'll repeat, we don't have purview over that.

2873
03:55:18,000 --> 03:55:21,442
We have purview over the policy as written, as the applications were submitted.

2874
03:55:23,763 --> 03:55:25,965
So, and I did speak to Ms.

2875
03:55:25,985 --> 03:55:28,166
Kendall about this today directly.

2876
03:55:32,869 --> 03:55:47,217
So if the committee has more questions or wants to entertain a motion or... Tim, do you have that application for this specific poll in front of you?

2877
03:55:48,448 --> 03:55:50,969
I don't have that particular one with me now.

2878
03:55:58,611 --> 03:55:59,252
Get it right here, Paul.

2879
03:55:59,272 --> 03:56:07,434
Okay, I just wanted to see, do they have the description of their reference to try and locate the pool?

2880
03:56:07,494 --> 03:56:09,535
Is that something you could read to us now?

2881
03:56:37,306 --> 03:56:39,126
All right, location selection criteria.

2882
03:56:39,346 --> 03:56:40,887
This is just in the application.

2883
03:56:42,467 --> 03:56:47,728
And the four polls referenced, I believe, are probably the ones that were just discussed.

2884
03:56:48,749 --> 03:56:50,389
So I'll just read it.

2885
03:56:50,749 --> 03:56:52,209
It's similar to a lot of the applications.

2886
03:56:52,630 --> 03:57:02,672
Choosing a location for small cell infrastructure has many factors to consider, such as local zoning requirements, state and federal regulations, as well as aesthetic requirements from the municipality.

2887
03:57:03,312 --> 03:57:21,513
In addition, Verizon Wireless has many guidelines on where small cells can be located in terms of having an effective wireless infrastructure site, including but not limited to height of the antenna above ground level, location with regards to other wireless infrastructure sites, and access to power and fiber backhaul connections.

2888
03:57:22,352 --> 03:57:36,498
The pole located at 101 Sheridan Avenue is superior to other locations, given that it is set in a heavily trafficked area for the purpose to increase the bandwidth and cellular quality of Verizon network devices in the vicinity.

2889
03:57:36,919 --> 03:57:39,280
The location itself is set in the public right of way.

2890
03:57:39,760 --> 03:57:50,465
This location was not only chosen for its compliance with Verizon wireless and national grid requirements, but with respect to the municipality's desire for co-location on an existing structure.

2891
03:57:51,065 --> 03:57:54,187
It is not directly adjacent to a park, school or playground.

2892
03:57:54,828 --> 03:58:07,977
The following table is a list of utility poles that are close to 101 Sheridan Avenue pole that do not meet all of the involved parties requirements to allow a small cell installation on a given utility pole.

2893
03:58:08,678 --> 03:58:15,603
This serves to illustrate the fact that many potential candidates cannot be chosen due to the mandatory guidelines.

2894
03:58:16,825 --> 03:58:28,293
So the alternate poll locations in this vicinity that were considered and described are poll 2438 at 99 Sheridan Avenue, poll number 3513 at 89 Sheridan Avenue, poll 1509 at 81 Sheridan Avenue, and poll 1511 at 113 Sheridan Avenue.

2895
03:58:28,313 --> 03:58:30,315
And the reasons are either transformer

2896
03:58:46,253 --> 03:58:51,995
or primary closers and primary risers as the gentleman from Verizon was indicating.

2897
03:58:54,315 --> 03:59:03,478
So that is the description of why they located it here and the alternate locations that were considered.

2898
03:59:05,919 --> 03:59:06,639
Okay, thanks.

2899
03:59:07,299 --> 03:59:07,459
Yep.

2900
03:59:19,222 --> 03:59:24,385
All right, so Marilyn Jordan also wanted to speak on this, so unmute Ms.

2901
03:59:24,505 --> 03:59:24,865
Jordan.

2902
03:59:26,166 --> 03:59:27,587
If I'm muted, can you hear me?

2903
03:59:28,487 --> 03:59:29,128
Hello, Marilyn.

2904
03:59:29,148 --> 03:59:29,608
Yes, I can.

2905
03:59:29,668 --> 03:59:29,948
Thank you.

2906
03:59:30,048 --> 03:59:30,588
Okay.

2907
03:59:31,609 --> 03:59:34,050
You told me that you received the

2908
03:59:35,830 --> 03:59:44,716
hand-delivered petition, which we passed around in the last two days, we got 30 signatures, even with COVID, people were answering the door to sign it.

2909
03:59:45,296 --> 03:59:47,297
Nobody wants this on this street.

2910
03:59:48,038 --> 03:59:53,341
This is not as heavily traveled as let's say Spring Street or Central Ave or even Salem Street.

2911
03:59:55,503 --> 03:59:57,124
I know you said there is a,

2912
03:59:59,680 --> 04:00:06,462
There's, I'd like to know what the noise policy is and the regulation on this, although he said there will be no fan.

2913
04:00:07,803 --> 04:00:09,803
I'm not sure there won't be still a humming.

2914
04:00:10,583 --> 04:00:13,324
This home has been in my family since 1955.

2915
04:00:17,406 --> 04:00:18,846
My son lives there now.

2916
04:00:19,486 --> 04:00:21,627
My sister owns it and lives there.

2917
04:00:23,347 --> 04:00:24,868
This is a family neighborhood.

2918
04:00:25,670 --> 04:00:34,058
And if you go all the way to the top of that street to central lab you'll see when a phone telephone pole that does not have a transform or anything on it.

2919
04:00:34,899 --> 04:00:46,511
At the end is the Franklin school which is now condos in there, they're putting one right in front of there on Central Avenue, I'm not sure the number but it's in your pile.

2920
04:00:48,695 --> 04:01:01,802
And at the other end of Sheridan Ave, between on the corner of Sheridan and Salem Street, going in the other direction, there is no transformer and nothing on that pole, nor is there any on, as I said, Hooker Street.

2921
04:01:03,183 --> 04:01:13,789
I just don't understand with all the people who do not want this on this street, that it just shouldn't be put there.

2922
04:01:13,989 --> 04:01:15,070
It's out of place.

2923
04:01:16,546 --> 04:01:22,667
It's in a very densely populated area.

2924
04:01:23,948 --> 04:01:26,968
Not densely traveled, but densely populated.

2925
04:01:29,669 --> 04:01:31,809
And most of these are single family homes.

2926
04:01:32,930 --> 04:01:35,330
And the owners live in them.

2927
04:01:36,110 --> 04:01:37,591
And they are family homes.

2928
04:01:39,331 --> 04:01:42,172
People have lived on this street and in this neighborhood for 55, 60 years.

2929
04:01:45,281 --> 04:01:47,202
My parents died in that house.

2930
04:01:49,324 --> 04:01:52,906
That is not fair to us to do this to us.

2931
04:01:53,547 --> 04:01:55,348
We've been Method residents since 1935.

2932
04:01:57,870 --> 04:02:02,453
We lived on Pool Street, we lived on Garfield Ave, and now we live on Sheridan Ave.

2933
04:02:03,174 --> 04:02:12,220
And I don't understand how Verizon can just willy-nilly say to us, well, this is what you have now.

2934
04:02:13,803 --> 04:02:15,565
or the FCC or anyone.

2935
04:02:15,805 --> 04:02:19,208
I called every single one.

2936
04:02:19,348 --> 04:02:21,210
I called Senator Warren.

2937
04:02:21,270 --> 04:02:22,631
I called Senator Maki.

2938
04:02:22,792 --> 04:02:24,533
I called Representative Clark.

2939
04:02:25,794 --> 04:02:27,076
I called Paul Donato.

2940
04:02:27,176 --> 04:02:33,762
He helped me, but I didn't hear from Maki or Warren or Clark.

2941
04:02:33,842 --> 04:02:38,867
If I had known she was in the city today, I would have been there to talk to her.

2942
04:02:40,601 --> 04:02:44,605
It's unconscionable that we're doing this on Sheridan Ave.

2943
04:02:45,766 --> 04:02:50,731
And all the people on Sheridan Ave who signed that petition, and I only had two days to get signatures.

2944
04:02:51,572 --> 04:02:56,157
If I had had longer time, I would have had hundreds of signatures.

2945
04:02:56,938 --> 04:03:01,142
I would have had all of Grand Ave, all of Sheridan, and all of Farragut.

2946
04:03:04,110 --> 04:03:05,731
And I guess that's all I have to say.

2947
04:03:06,311 --> 04:03:11,013
I really hope that you will listen to our plea and deny this.

2948
04:03:12,093 --> 04:03:14,134
Verizon can find another spot.

2949
04:03:14,454 --> 04:03:15,655
Thank you, thank you, Ms.

2950
04:03:15,675 --> 04:03:16,075
Stratton.

2951
04:03:16,155 --> 04:03:23,938
I hope you have been hearing what I have been saying and other folks have been saying regarding the position that this particular committee is in.

2952
04:03:24,918 --> 04:03:29,120
I understand the petitions and I understand your concerns.

2953
04:03:30,642 --> 04:03:44,505
And it seems like that the sort of the overhead clutter and basically visual pollution is a concern.

2954
04:03:45,225 --> 04:03:49,125
And it sounds like to some of the health impacts might be a concern.

2955
04:03:49,845 --> 04:03:57,707
And, you know, as it's been stated multiple times, you know, the health concerns aren't in the purview of this committee.

2956
04:04:00,040 --> 04:04:04,122
the fact that lots of residents on Sheridan Avenue don't want this.

2957
04:04:05,502 --> 04:04:14,166
If you want this committee to deny it, then I would be concerned that it's going to land on this poll anyway, through the courts.

2958
04:04:15,266 --> 04:04:29,092
And again, if we have a little bit of control with conditions here, and I'm trying to maintain some of that control, but we are totally hearing

2959
04:04:30,147 --> 04:04:39,931
Well, lots of courts have taken it up, and the results have not been great in regards to many of the concerns that folks are citing.

2960
04:04:40,651 --> 04:04:43,672
I would like to say I would like to take my chances with the court.

2961
04:04:43,772 --> 04:04:46,453
It's 16 feet from my sister's bedroom window.

2962
04:04:47,454 --> 04:04:48,694
I'll take my chances.

2963
04:04:49,234 --> 04:04:49,634
Understood.

2964
04:04:49,654 --> 04:04:50,715
Thank you very much.

2965
04:04:51,395 --> 04:04:53,456
Mr. Chairman, can I ask a question?

2966
04:04:54,316 --> 04:04:58,218
I know the question was posed to Verizon as to why this location, and I

2967
04:04:59,232 --> 04:05:03,295
really didn't understand the answer.

2968
04:05:03,415 --> 04:05:10,481
Like this one poll is gonna blow their whole, that didn't make sense to me.

2969
04:05:10,541 --> 04:05:12,823
So could we get a better answer on that?

2970
04:05:13,984 --> 04:05:14,725
Yeah, we can ask.

2971
04:05:14,865 --> 04:05:17,167
We can certainly ask Verizon any more questions.

2972
04:05:17,227 --> 04:05:17,947
Thank you very much, Ms.

2973
04:05:17,967 --> 04:05:18,248
Jordan.

2974
04:05:19,929 --> 04:05:23,632
Or why not this poll on Hooker Street, which is right around the corner?

2975
04:05:26,802 --> 04:05:32,266
I can answer to that one if you actually get a little bit closer to that poll it has what's called a telco box on it.

2976
04:05:33,147 --> 04:05:35,349
So it's unattachable for us.

2977
04:05:39,852 --> 04:05:49,639
Can I, can I get the answer again like why, why we have to have this poll like it's gonna mess up the whole entire network or something I didn't I didn't buy that I'm not sure what that is was.

2978
04:05:59,888 --> 04:06:01,055
You guys have any more detail?

2979
04:06:02,500 --> 04:06:06,481
you know, why this poll is critical to the network or your coverage?

2980
04:06:06,941 --> 04:06:20,466
Yeah, we, you know, pretty much when, you know, we want to get a site, we need a site here and the way the other sites work and they play with each other, how we, how we really get it is that if we start moving the poll too far north, then we just create another gap.

2981
04:06:21,106 --> 04:06:23,807
And those are the gaps need to be, you know, they would need to be filled.

2982
04:06:24,927 --> 04:06:29,869
And statistically, we will probably wind up coming right back to the same location, looking for a poll.

2983
04:06:29,889 --> 04:06:30,649
And on,

2984
04:06:32,827 --> 04:06:36,748
on the point from the other gentleman, Sean, those polls are not available to us.

2985
04:06:38,049 --> 04:06:38,829
They're not workable.

2986
04:07:03,380 --> 04:07:06,642
This one a block and a half away on grant too far away.

2987
04:07:06,662 --> 04:07:14,866
But which one you.

2988
04:07:15,606 --> 04:07:17,647
12 grants where the stop sign is.

2989
04:07:22,209 --> 04:07:27,131
On this location, it would be on this corner, so it would be here.

2990
04:07:30,565 --> 04:07:33,306
So that one, it looks like it's a three-way junction pole.

2991
04:07:33,326 --> 04:07:38,228
It's got a primary power going up and down the street, and then it looks like it has a primary connection coming across the street.

2992
04:07:42,190 --> 04:07:44,011
You can't use it because of that?

2993
04:07:45,411 --> 04:07:47,092
Right, that's National Grid's policies.

2994
04:07:48,193 --> 04:07:56,276
All the reasons I'm giving for not being able to attach to these poles is per National Grid's attachment MLA agreement that we have with them.

2995
04:08:01,790 --> 04:08:04,552
Do you guys have options to install new poles?

2996
04:08:08,234 --> 04:08:17,500
We could certainly install new poles, but we've always gone out and found existing infrastructure rather than going out and dropping new.

2997
04:08:17,520 --> 04:08:22,524
If there's something that we can use in the area, we'd rather use something existing.

2998
04:08:22,564 --> 04:08:27,967
That's usually where municipalities would want to see us is on existing structures.

2999
04:08:31,510 --> 04:08:42,278
Yeah, I mean, I don't really like utility poles in general, so I wouldn't want more added, but just wanted to ask a question rather than ask the question.

3000
04:08:42,298 --> 04:08:45,381
So, okay.

3001
04:08:46,201 --> 04:08:49,404
So listen, it's 10, almost 10 45 here.

3002
04:08:50,264 --> 04:08:52,546
We've made some significant progress on this agenda.

3003
04:08:55,528 --> 04:08:57,950
I'm leaning towards falling asleep.

3004
04:08:57,970 --> 04:08:58,691
So,

3005
04:09:01,105 --> 04:09:03,346
And I make a suggestion on this specifically.

3006
04:09:03,366 --> 04:09:04,366
Oh, please.

3007
04:09:04,386 --> 04:09:12,549
Yeah, we can feel like we need to take a break and, you know, continue this hearing.

3008
04:09:13,769 --> 04:09:18,551
Could we ask that Verizon seriously reconsider this location.

3009
04:09:18,571 --> 04:09:24,173
And when we reopen the hearing, we would start with this location and ask them if they have any

3010
04:09:26,103 --> 04:09:28,785
other alternatives that they could propose at that time.

3011
04:09:28,805 --> 04:09:32,528
And that would allow them some time to talk to their engineers.

3012
04:09:33,128 --> 04:09:33,348
Yeah.

3013
04:09:35,230 --> 04:09:35,410
Yeah.

3014
04:09:35,990 --> 04:09:36,090
Yeah.

3015
04:09:36,110 --> 04:09:38,132
I'd like to do that too, Tim.

3016
04:09:38,292 --> 04:09:45,357
I'm not agreeing with the description of why they need to use this location and why they can't put it somewhere else.

3017
04:09:45,417 --> 04:09:49,140
So I'm ready to do that also.

3018
04:09:49,160 --> 04:09:50,281
I agree.

3019
04:09:50,361 --> 04:09:52,382
And I will just say, you know, that,

3020
04:09:54,696 --> 04:10:10,982
over the course of the year plus that this has been active or these applications have been in the city, this particular poll is the one that we have received the most commentary on from the public and most of it is not favorable.

3021
04:10:11,903 --> 04:10:23,587
So I would like to ask Verizon to confirm or explore any locations that may not be on Sheridan Avenue like that one

3022
04:10:24,538 --> 04:10:25,298
that Alicia showed.

3023
04:10:26,739 --> 04:10:33,223
With that said, I mean, I know Verizon, I know you guys are going to want to keep going, but it is late.

3024
04:10:33,604 --> 04:10:39,808
And I believe, you know, we should continue the hearing to a date certain.

3025
04:10:40,448 --> 04:10:46,352
And we can do it, you know, we can do it a week from today, if the committee

3026
04:10:47,222 --> 04:10:48,222
Members are available.

3027
04:10:48,262 --> 04:10:56,065
Before I turn it to Verizon, I wanna talk to the committee members to see if we're available on a date certain, no later than a week from today.

3028
04:11:00,106 --> 04:11:05,268
We have the community development board hearing a week from today and I have to be at that.

3029
04:11:06,148 --> 04:11:10,729
And that starts at seven and could easily go two or more hours.

3030
04:11:10,749 --> 04:11:13,150
Okay, Wednesday.

3031
04:11:15,199 --> 04:11:25,487
Um, there is a public meeting about 200 Boston Ave scheduled for Davis at 6 to 7.

3032
04:11:27,528 --> 04:11:28,389
I have to be at that.

3033
04:11:28,529 --> 04:11:30,571
Are we talking about the 14th?

3034
04:11:30,651 --> 04:11:32,012
What are we looking at?

3035
04:11:32,672 --> 04:11:32,952
The 14th.

3036
04:11:33,052 --> 04:11:35,074
14th, yeah.

3037
04:11:36,475 --> 04:11:39,477
That's the, uh, you said 200 Boston Ave, Alicia, right?

3038
04:11:39,497 --> 04:11:39,597
Yep.

3039
04:11:39,777 --> 04:11:42,219
I think Paul and I both have to be at that public meeting.

3040
04:11:42,259 --> 04:11:44,561
Yeah, we're gonna both be at that, right.

3041
04:11:45,393 --> 04:11:53,621
If from six to seven, I don't anticipate that running very late, but then we'd be talking about starting at seven, seven 30.

3042
04:11:53,801 --> 04:11:57,164
I'd hate to commit to before seven 15.

3043
04:11:57,324 --> 04:11:57,704
Is the.

3044
04:11:57,724 --> 04:12:01,328
Monday the 12th.

3045
04:12:02,288 --> 04:12:04,170
I can't do.

3046
04:12:04,190 --> 04:12:08,394
Can't do the 13th might be able to do Monday the 12th.

3047
04:12:11,488 --> 04:12:12,389
I can do the 12th.

3048
04:12:12,869 --> 04:12:16,372
Well, just a cautionary tale on the 12th, we may be up against the open meeting law.

3049
04:12:17,633 --> 04:12:18,954
Yeah, I don't know that you'd be able to post.

3050
04:12:19,195 --> 04:12:23,979
What would be the earliest that we could meet?

3051
04:12:24,939 --> 04:12:25,360
Tuesday.

3052
04:12:26,100 --> 04:12:26,821
Tuesday.

3053
04:12:28,282 --> 04:12:31,145
Do we have to do, I know we do because of the residents.

3054
04:12:31,225 --> 04:12:34,327
I was just gonna say, do we have to do, could we do earlier than later?

3055
04:12:34,347 --> 04:12:36,929
Do we have to do in the evening or could we do?

3056
04:12:37,490 --> 04:12:38,731
It's a city council night.

3057
04:12:41,763 --> 04:12:43,004
Tuesday the 13th.

3058
04:12:44,165 --> 04:12:49,128
I have a placeholder for traffic commission that evening, Tuesday the 13th at five.

3059
04:12:49,148 --> 04:12:53,471
I haven't been officially notified, but I assume.

3060
04:12:53,491 --> 04:12:59,815
Do we want to just try the 14th at 7.30?

3061
04:13:02,556 --> 04:13:07,800
And I think what Marianne was suggesting is, would it be inappropriate for us to start this meeting

3062
04:13:09,694 --> 04:13:16,157
Well, four to six is no better than starting at 730 on the 14th.

3063
04:13:16,737 --> 04:13:26,180
Yeah, I mean, if we don't do it on the 14th, it starts getting, you know, into the next week.

3064
04:13:27,441 --> 04:13:30,922
I think we have to find some way to do it on the 14th.

3065
04:13:31,002 --> 04:13:32,723
That looks like the best date for everybody.

3066
04:13:33,660 --> 04:13:45,967
I agree, and if it's at 7.30, this, of course, would be the third continuation, but we, let's see, let me just check our progress here.

3067
04:13:45,987 --> 04:13:52,911
I was thinking more like standing at like five or six, I mean.

3068
04:13:53,991 --> 04:13:58,494
Well, look, Cummings, meaning that Paul and I have to be out is six to seven.

3069
04:13:58,514 --> 04:14:00,155
Oh, okay.

3070
04:14:01,878 --> 04:14:09,501
but either on any of the other days, starting at five or six as opposed to starting at seven, 7.30, because then we're gonna be in the same predicament.

3071
04:14:09,521 --> 04:14:11,221
We're gonna be sitting here at 11 o'clock.

3072
04:14:11,861 --> 04:14:13,522
There's 20 left, so.

3073
04:14:13,962 --> 04:14:20,104
Yeah, well, if we start at 6.30 and we've only got 20, that shouldn't go that long.

3074
04:14:20,124 --> 04:14:22,765
I don't think Marianne, you know, like these last two have gone.

3075
04:14:24,676 --> 04:14:34,560
No, and folks, that is, I'm trying to be respectful of public and I'm trying to be respectful of Verizon.

3076
04:14:34,580 --> 04:14:37,381
I'm trying to be respectful of this committee the best that I can.

3077
04:14:38,281 --> 04:14:43,584
So I think that if we can land a time on the 14th.

3078
04:14:47,545 --> 04:14:52,147
Tim, I think the only way it's gonna work on the 14th is if we do 6.30 and we just- You mean 7.30?

3079
04:14:55,092 --> 04:14:59,813
7.30?

3080
04:14:55,112 --> 04:14:59,813
The Cummings meeting has been bubble-sized for 6 to 7.

3081
04:15:01,013 --> 04:15:02,214
Oh, I'm sorry, Alicia.

3082
04:15:02,234 --> 04:15:05,054
Yeah, why don't we do 7.30 then?

3083
04:15:05,074 --> 04:15:07,395
7.30 is late for people.

3084
04:15:08,335 --> 04:15:11,096
I know, but we risk pushing it out even further.

3085
04:15:11,116 --> 04:15:16,457
We don't have a lot of options, though.

3086
04:15:17,701 --> 04:15:27,725
Yeah, Paul and Alicia, with respect to the Cummings meeting, if you do want to schedule this for earlier than that, I'll be there and Vic will be there to cover.

3087
04:15:27,945 --> 04:15:32,567
And we can try to front load some of the questions for you guys at that meeting to try to sequence them a little better.

3088
04:15:32,607 --> 04:15:34,948
If you wanted to do it at 6.30, we can get you out of there by then.

3089
04:15:36,329 --> 04:15:37,849
We could start this meeting.

3090
04:15:38,129 --> 04:15:41,911
With that, how about we started this meeting at 7 on the 14th.

3091
04:15:43,252 --> 04:15:46,173
And so then we'll step out a few minutes before 7.

3092
04:15:48,109 --> 04:15:51,731
Yeah, why don't we do that then seven o'clock on the 14th.

3093
04:15:52,652 --> 04:15:52,892
Yeah.

3094
04:15:53,612 --> 04:15:55,033
Okay, it's next Wednesday.

3095
04:15:55,053 --> 04:15:59,696
Okay, now that the committee has come up with a time.

3096
04:16:03,198 --> 04:16:03,738
Verizon.

3097
04:16:06,100 --> 04:16:07,120
Given the late hour.

3098
04:16:07,881 --> 04:16:08,841
Is that acceptable to you.

3099
04:16:21,055 --> 04:16:22,336
is what acceptable, Tim?

3100
04:16:22,856 --> 04:16:31,858
Oh, I'm sorry, to continue this next Wednesday, so six days from now at seven o'clock, we got 20 applications left in the agenda.

3101
04:16:32,698 --> 04:16:33,098
Some of the 14.

3102
04:16:33,479 --> 04:16:34,619
Yeah.

3103
04:16:36,479 --> 04:16:41,021
Well, without extending the shot clock, you're setting the date, we'll be there.

3104
04:16:42,741 --> 04:16:45,482
Yeah, I mean, the shot clocks, as we already know, we're well past that.

3105
04:16:45,542 --> 04:16:48,743
So I wanna make sure that you guys, we got some momentum going.

3106
04:16:49,896 --> 04:16:52,157
You know, we've got 20 left.

3107
04:16:53,178 --> 04:17:00,882
No, I understand and certainly appreciate the work of the community as well as the ad hoc committee.

3108
04:17:02,242 --> 04:17:08,846
But if you have scheduled for Wednesday the 14th at seven o'clock, we'll be there.

3109
04:17:09,666 --> 04:17:10,907
Okay, thank you, Sam.

3110
04:17:11,967 --> 04:17:17,370
All right, so I'm going to put, well, I need a motion and then we'll put it to a vote.

3111
04:17:21,267 --> 04:17:24,529
Motion to continue the meeting for the 14th at seven o'clock.

3112
04:17:26,530 --> 04:17:27,291
Do I hear a second?

3113
04:17:28,111 --> 04:17:33,894
Can we just clarify, you're continuing the public hearings on the 20 open applications?

3114
04:17:34,555 --> 04:17:37,597
On the 20 open applications, including 101 Sheridan Avenue.

3115
04:17:37,617 --> 04:17:43,220
And in the meantime, I'd ask Verizon to do the due diligence on the location of that particular antenna.

3116
04:17:44,060 --> 04:17:46,622
I just wanted to clarify, I was on the ones that had not yet been voted.

3117
04:17:47,798 --> 04:17:53,580
Mr. Chair, we'll do the due diligence, but I just want to make the point that we did the due diligence coming in.

3118
04:17:53,600 --> 04:17:55,441
That's why Sean was able to give you those answers.

3119
04:17:55,721 --> 04:17:57,142
We're happy to take another hard look.

3120
04:17:57,862 --> 04:17:58,362
Understood.

3121
04:17:58,482 --> 04:17:58,862
Understood.

3122
04:17:58,902 --> 04:18:00,063
Yeah, I do realize that.

3123
04:18:00,103 --> 04:18:00,903
I do realize that.

3124
04:18:01,203 --> 04:18:14,708
I'm just asking on behalf of the residents of Sheridan Avenue who have put significant time into gathering a petition and have put, you know, are very concerned about the location and their homes and

3125
04:18:15,596 --> 04:18:17,638
what the impacts this antenna may have.

3126
04:18:18,859 --> 04:18:23,644
So, you know, with that said, I think it's worth a second look, and we will also take a second look at it.

3127
04:18:24,524 --> 04:18:26,366
So I think we're going to do it that way.

3128
04:18:26,386 --> 04:18:27,667
And we'll start there.

3129
04:18:27,687 --> 04:18:32,512
And let's see, anything else?

3130
04:18:33,372 --> 04:18:36,475
So we got the second, did we get receive a second on that?

3131
04:18:36,515 --> 04:18:37,216
I believe we did, right?

3132
04:18:38,753 --> 04:18:47,138
Okay, so the motion is to continue this public hearing, starting with 101 Sheridan Avenue, which was taken out of order.

3133
04:18:47,859 --> 04:18:51,441
And then the plan would be to go back to order on that.

3134
04:18:52,162 --> 04:18:57,525
And the date is seven o'clock on the 14th.

3135
04:18:58,546 --> 04:19:02,869
And do I have a, can I get a vote?

3136
04:19:04,670 --> 04:19:07,512
Can you just clarify to folks where they can find the Zoom information again?

3137
04:19:08,118 --> 04:19:10,819
Oh, yes, it's on the city calendar.

3138
04:19:10,839 --> 04:19:18,601
I know that the city event calendar posted in the clerk's office and on the Verizon 5G website for the city.

3139
04:19:19,301 --> 04:19:19,641
Thank you.

3140
04:19:20,021 --> 04:19:20,922
Dave, did I cover everything?

3141
04:19:20,942 --> 04:19:28,684
As far as where the links, the Zoom information, the agenda.

3142
04:19:28,704 --> 04:19:29,704
We'll match them up to what you said.

3143
04:19:30,585 --> 04:19:33,226
Okay, yeah, I mean, I think it's already all there, so.

3144
04:19:34,487 --> 04:19:36,128
And Mr. Chairman, please don't close the meeting.

3145
04:19:36,168 --> 04:19:37,368
I just have to save the chat.

3146
04:19:37,388 --> 04:19:39,169
I have to download and save the chat.

3147
04:19:39,589 --> 04:19:40,870
Yeah, I'll be the last one here.

3148
04:19:40,890 --> 04:19:42,110
I'll be the last one here.

3149
04:19:42,891 --> 04:19:47,112
So, seven o'clock on the 14th, and you just need to vote on this.

3150
04:19:47,473 --> 04:19:47,953
Alicia Hunt?

3151
04:19:48,633 --> 04:19:48,893
Yes.

3152
04:19:50,034 --> 04:19:50,274
Yes.

3153
04:19:50,574 --> 04:19:51,114
Paul Moki?

3154
04:19:51,935 --> 04:19:52,215
Yes.

3155
04:19:53,315 --> 04:19:54,135
Marianne O'Connor?

3156
04:19:54,736 --> 04:19:55,036
Yes.

3157
04:19:56,076 --> 04:19:57,257
And Tim McGibbon, yes.

3158
04:19:58,370 --> 04:19:59,510
Thank you very much, everybody.

3159
04:19:59,910 --> 04:20:06,152
And we will see you seven o'clock on Wednesday, and we'll pick up where we left off, and we will see if we can make it to the end.

3160
04:20:06,172 --> 04:20:07,012
I think we will be able to.

3161
04:20:07,052 --> 04:20:08,813
Do we need a motion to adjourn?

3162
04:20:08,833 --> 04:20:12,094
Yeah, a motion to adjourn.

3163
04:20:13,914 --> 04:20:14,314
Second.

3164
04:20:16,275 --> 04:20:17,495
Am I allowed to motion to adjourn?

3165
04:20:17,515 --> 04:20:18,175
I am not sure.

3166
04:20:19,856 --> 04:20:21,396
Mary Ann motion to adjourn.

3167
04:20:21,416 --> 04:20:22,937
Mary Ann motion, yeah.

3168
04:20:22,957 --> 04:20:23,797
All right, second.

3169
04:20:24,077 --> 04:20:25,277
I second it, so.

3170
04:20:25,397 --> 04:20:26,418
All right, Alicia.

3171
04:20:26,438 --> 04:20:26,498
Yes.

3172
04:20:28,680 --> 04:20:29,561
Paul, Moki?

3173
04:20:29,601 --> 04:20:29,841
Yes.

3174
04:20:30,602 --> 04:20:31,162
Mary O'Connor?

3175
04:20:31,843 --> 04:20:32,103
Yes.

3176
04:20:32,924 --> 04:20:34,025
Tim McGowan is also a yes.

3177
04:20:34,465 --> 04:20:35,967
Thank you for everyone's patience.

3178
04:20:36,027 --> 04:20:37,168
Thank you for everyone's input.

3179
04:20:38,169 --> 04:20:40,811
This is a lot of work, so appreciate it.

3180
04:20:41,632 --> 04:20:42,212
Thank you very much.

3181
04:20:42,232 --> 04:20:43,834
Thank you all.

3182
04:20:43,854 --> 04:20:44,414
Thank you.
