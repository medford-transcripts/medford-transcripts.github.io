    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=100.848s">I</a>  think we can participate in some of the agenda, but Melanie will turn off when I would like to address the special education.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=108.733s">On</a>  a motion of Mr. Van Duke that the rules be suspended, all in favor say aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=112.775s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=113.576s">Rules</a>  are suspended. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=115.037s">Melanie?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=118.978s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=119.398s">I,</a>  on the agenda, there was nothing on the committee community participation, but yes, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=126.023s">I</a>  didn't actually ask ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=128.725s">I</a>  just prompted me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=130.346s">I</a>  just came tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=131.247s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=131.727s">I</a>  appreciate you suspending the rules for a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=133.848s">I</a>  just wanted to invite the school committee next month, especially in light of the elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=138.312s">We</a>  wanted to invite the school committee to the Medford special education parent advisory council meeting next month on December 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=145.152s">It's</a>  from seven to nine at the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=148.334s">I'm</a>  sure you won't, we wouldn't expect you to stay the whole time, but we'd love to have coffee and pastries and just host the school committee members and particularly the new school committee members as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=156.179s">And</a>  just a way to say hello and keep the conversation going. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=159.941s">That's</a>  pretty much it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=161.062s">And</a>  also this Wednesday, we have basic rights in special education at the Andrews Middle School from seven to nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=167.726s">So</a>  it's a great opportunity for folks, especially general educators, frankly, to learn a lot about special education and basic rights.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=176.045s">That's</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=177.726s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=179.127s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=179.848s">I</a>  just want to address, I want to say thank you, but I also want to let you know that I would love to be there, but I have to be at a state meeting at the same night in Marlborough. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=188.534s">So</a>  please keep me advised.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=204.019s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=205.0s">Mr.</a>  Mayor and members of the committee, I want to get this to you very quickly because obviously we have to make some phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=215.973s">And</a>  I want to make sure that we're all in agreement as to what's going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=220.215s">As</a>  you know, we approved a trip to Washington, DC, which was going to go there Thursday morning with about 35 students and faculty members and other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=229.56s">We</a>  have checked with the insurance company and the like, and we are planning to cancel that trip in light of recent events at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=237.345s">It's</a>  unfortunate, but there's all kinds of safety and security issues that are associated with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=243.388s">It's</a>  covered by insurance at least to 75% of the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=248.282s">We</a>  may get 100% of the cost back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=250.023s">If</a>  we don't, we'll talk about how we might be able to help the students and others recapture the remaining part, or reschedule it at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=257.667s">But</a>  at this particular point in time, we can't get enough assurances of safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=261.609s">The</a>  youngsters would be in situations where they were out in the open, in public places, traveling into monuments and other things of that type. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=271.309s">It's</a>  just a bad time for people who are traveling, given the current news that's been out there and some statements made by terrorist groups around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=280.073s">So</a>  unless there's an objection, I'm going to go ahead and cancel that immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=286.455s">Chair,</a>  do you have any objection?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=288.016s">Mr.</a>  Mayor.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=288.316s">I</a>  move that we cancel the trip until further notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=291.597s">On</a>  the motion, all in favor say aye.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=293.158s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=295.014s">I</a>  just, you know, I know some of the kids going on that trip and they're looking so forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=299.619s">Has</a>  there been any discussion with them yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=305.085s">Was</a>  there any discussion today?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=307.008s">Well,</a>  you know, with the high school, there's been a discussion with different people, but Bernadette's been in the middle of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=312.394s">Can</a>  you probably come up, Bernadette, and talk a little bit about that?</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=320.625s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=322.286s">So</a>  no formal, obviously, notification went out because we wanted to wait for the superintendent to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=329.991s">There</a>  were several students who did approach the chaperones at different times during the day with some concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=335.915s">There</a>  were at least two parents by late afternoon who had contacted members of the administration about concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=342.879s">So</a>  no, the students do not know, but perhaps they know now if their parents are watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=350.063s">So</a>  we're very sorry, and we know that this is going to be a wonderful opportunity to learn about civic education. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=357.452s">So</a>  just moments ago, two of the chaperones are here, Nalita Lopori and Nicole Chalifoux, and they're very disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=364.4s">We</a>  talked about perhaps some other opportunities that we could create for them here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=371.347s">So,</a>  we know that they're disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=377.914s">The</a>  chaperones are disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=380.197s">Taryn</a>  Ross and Michael Skorger did an immense amount of work putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=384.761s">They're</a>  very disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=386.763s">But,</a>  we all understand that security is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=390.665s">is</a>  the first and foremost concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=393.268s">So</a>  we certainly do accept, we accept this decision and we will move forward in a productive way.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=400.755s">And</a>  if I could ask specifically, I wonder if there's been any conversation with the group that's hosting the event and whether there's any chance they might put it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=410.544s">Since</a>  the other school's systems must have our same concerns.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=414.67s">Okay,</a>  so as of this afternoon, we learned that Brookline, who is leaving tomorrow, is still moving forward with their trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=424.055s">They</a>  were outside of the 48 hours or within the 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=428.698s">They</a>  did not have the same option that we have of canceling two days in advance and getting that 75% back, so I'm not sure if that's what went into their decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=440.345s">The</a>  travel company was very receptive to our concerns today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=444.427s">I</a>  talked to them along with Michael Skorger and Taryn Ross. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=447.289s">They</a>  were very understanding, very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=450.41s">There</a>  was no hesitation on their part. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=453.372s">They</a>  just wanted to contact the insurance company. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=456.073s">So</a>  as the superintendent said, right now, they are canceling for any reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=461.639s">That</a>  category, they get 75% back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=467.084s">There's</a>  a possibility parents could be reimbursed 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=470.788s">We're</a>  working on that, but it will be at least 75%. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=472.95s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=473.35s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=475.032s">It's</a>  nice to hear a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=476.494s">It's</a>  very, very disappointing for the students.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=480.091s">Mister</a>  Scudero.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=481.112s">Bernadette,</a>  do we know how much the 25% we're talking about, how much money we're talking?</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=486.876s">Actually,</a>  I don't know if Nicole or Nelida have the exact price. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=489.938s">My</a>  understanding was it was about $550. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=491.159s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=491.98s">It's</a>  about $550. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=493.24s">So</a>  about 75% of that would be, what, $420 or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=494.942s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=495.062s">So</a>  whatever 75% of the $550 is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=495.642s">So</a>  it's about $100.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=510.678s">I</a>  know we just, I just wanted to ask, is there any way of discussing a future, like further down, like maybe, hopefully, maybe in the middle of the year or at the end of the year?</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=521.706s">So</a>  the travel company's advice was to just cancel, instead of postponing, because we originally thought we'd postpone, their advice was to cancel out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=531.474s">That</a>  way the students can get the money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=533.415s">And</a>  then in the future, if we want, we can talk about rebooking.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=539.0s">Mr.</a>  Mayor, just one other point I think that everyone needs to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=543.023s">Obviously,</a>  we don't like to do these things, but we may be able to schedule some Skyping with the Congress people and other people that they would otherwise have talked to in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=553.81s">And</a>  so we'll look at that tomorrow morning, see if we can't create another experience that would be at least a good experience for them to carry out that kind of work.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=563.638s">And</a>  now that we've discussed it here, I mean, are parents going to be notified via mail, via telephone?</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=570.524s">We</a>  need to discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=571.805s">In</a>  fact, I was just on the phone with Michael Skorka outside just before the meeting began, and that was his question, is how do we convey this to parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=579.531s">So</a>  to the parents who are listening, you know that the trip is canceled and that you are entitled to at least 75% off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=586.715s">All</a>  students had the insurance, which was a great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=590.136s">How</a>  we officially communicate that beyond tonight, we will determine tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=596.199s">How</a>  many students were we talking about?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=598.82s">About</a>  32, 35.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=603.388s">36.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=603.468s">Well,</a>  I would hope that it would be a little bit more personal than just listening to it over in a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=611.314s">So</a>  I know it's hard because of time wise, but I would really appreciate that if something else could be done rather than just, I mean, there's two chaperones, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=620.141s">Two</a>  chaperones. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=621.102s">Four.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=621.602s">Four.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=622.343s">So</a>  maybe the list could be divided up and just a personal phone call real quick to those parents.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=627.947s">Mrs.</a>  DiBenedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=629.69s">Safety</a>  is my first concern for our students and taking care of them, but I'm just curious Do you know of any other systems that are backing up? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=637.358s">Are</a>  we the first? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=638.178s">Are</a>  we the only?</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=639.239s">I'm</a>  just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=640.44s">So</a>  when I talked to Go Travel, the company who organized it today, they said that they were fully expecting to hear from Medford today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=649.544s">They</a>  didn't mention any other school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=653.666s">We</a>  learned that Brookline, I don't know how many schools were going down this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=659.029s">I</a>  know Brookline was. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=660.35s">And</a>  like I just said, Brookline is moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=664.772s">Other</a>  school systems, I'm not aware of.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=668.105s">Do</a>  you think that there will be another opportunity for a similar thing to happen for this group of students in this school year?</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=675.127s">I'm</a>  not sure how many seniors were on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=677.987s">I'm</a>  not sure about the likelihood of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=680.888s">I</a>  would like to think that things are going to calm down and that our students will have an opportunity to travel to <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=689.84s">to</a>  Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=691.061s">As</a>  you know, it's a wonderful city, great things to learn about our capital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=696.644s">So</a>  I am hoping that they will have that opportunity again, if not this year, then perhaps in the next school year.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=702.327s">I</a>  mean, obviously, this is a heightened period of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=705.99s">It's</a>  right after a significant event. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=708.131s">And,</a>  you know, we have to be measured in how we approach these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=713.434s">It</a>  may be that in a few weeks, things would change and other things are possible going forward in the next few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=718.983s">Right</a>  now, not enough is known about what could be happening internationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=724.804s">We</a>  need to give people an opportunity to tell us before we start putting any situations in place that could compromise the safety of the students.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1251.57s">I'm</a>  going to call up again, Nelida Lepore, who is leading the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1258.491s">We</a>  just talked about trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1260.772s">As</a>  you know, the nation's capital has been tapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1263.392s">So</a>  this is a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1264.493s">It's</a>  a little further away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1266.132s">So</a>  I think we're in a pretty good place to look at this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1269.814s">So</a>  I'll turn it over to Nelida.</p>

    <p>[CUpSL015tZc_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1271.895s">Buenas</a>  noches. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1273.995s">Yes,</a>  we're planning, and also we're planning the trip in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1277.597s">So</a>  hopefully by then we will have a better idea of the situation, what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1283.46s">But</a>  I am planning a trip for the April vacation with the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1288.482s">We</a>  usually leave on the Thursday evening before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1291.92s">And</a>  that's done to save some costs, because there's a $45 charge to leave on Friday, Saturday from Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1300.625s">I</a>  think that's most airports they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1303.146s">So</a>  just to save some money for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1305.207s">And</a>  then we come back seven days later. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1308.209s">But</a>  we're taking the Pelicano tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1310.31s">And</a>  so based on the number of students that we will take, hopefully I'm trying to get 20, 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1316.313s">The</a>  cost of the trip will be $2,165. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1321.701s">which</a>  will include everything that they will be doing on the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1326.783s">The</a>  interesting thing about Puerto Rico is that if you've been to Costa Rica and you've been to Spain, Puerto Rico is a combination of the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1336.246s">It</a>  has a strong cultural colonial experience, but then along it has the science component to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1343.069s">So</a>  one of the things that we will be doing is going to the Bioluminescent Bay, which I've taken the students before to other times. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1350.341s">There</a>  are only six in the world, and Puerto Rico has two. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1354.024s">So</a>  they're able to experience things like this, the rainforest. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1357.626s">But</a>  then we have dance lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1360.208s">We</a>  do some salsa, and this year I've included another type of dance that's typical of the island, which is the bomba, which shows our African heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1370.033s">And</a>  we've included a cooking class, and we've also included a community service component. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1376.676s">We</a>  will be visiting a school, and the students will be getting community service hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1381.238s">So</a>  it's a little bit different, this trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1383.379s">I</a>  try to tweak each trip to customize it to fit today's educational needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1390.042s">The</a>  trip includes the air flight, all the hotels, two meals a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1396.078s">and</a>  entrances to all the exhibits and things that we'll be doing, like the zip lining and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1403.379s">So</a>  hopefully it'll be a go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1405.22s">So</a>  far, five students have already registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1408.38s">And</a>  they all understand that it was with the approval of the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1413.041s">Mr.</a>  Mayer? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1413.601s">Mr.</a>  Mayer.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1414.141s">Sounds</a>  like a great trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1416.382s">By</a>  the way, I have a lot of free time in April, if you need anything.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1419.202s">You're</a>  welcome to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1420.582s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1420.722s">Happy</a>  zip lining with everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1422.163s">Mrs.</a>  Spunio. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1425.505s">I</a>  think it's a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1427.426s">My</a>  concern is, unfortunately, because of things that are happening more so than ever, is there going to be insurance involved with this price? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1436.191s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[CUpSL015tZc_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1436.611s">We</a>  always encourage the students to take out insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1439.653s">And</a>  in light of what's just happened, we're going to demand it if they want to go on the trip just to protect ourselves.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1447.791s">Okay,</a>  when you say that you advise if they get it, is that something that's separate or is that something?</p>

    <p>[CUpSL015tZc_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1453.556s">Yes,</a>  it's separate costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1455.257s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1455.837s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1456.478s">Could</a>  we just look into that though because I just want to make sure that when we do these types of trips for our students, I think it's very beneficiary that we include. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1466.846s">I</a>  know it costs a little bit more money, but it's very beneficial for us to make sure that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1472.387s">that</a>  insurance, because I believe that insurance not only covers the cancellation of the trip, but it also incurs if by any chance, God forbid, there's any type of sickness or someone gets hurt or someone, and I think it's very beneficial that it is part of the package deal.</p>

    <p>[CUpSL015tZc_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1488.32s">I</a>  have been traveling with the students since 1999, and that has always been a priority that I've mentioned to the students, because we always book the trip <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1497.697s">well</a>  in advance, and I always say you never know what will happen from here to there at that time, so that it really is crucial to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1505.619s">I</a>  mean, it's their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1508.26s">It's</a>  a gamble they take. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1509.461s">It</a>  usually comes out about $250, $260 extra to do it.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1518.169s">Just</a>  a point of information, there are other opportunities out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1522.01s">I</a>  know because I've looked them up that they're not as high as that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1525.251s">So</a>  it has to be researched a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1527.371s">I'm</a>  not saying you, but I am saying that that is something, especially where these students are going and where the ones that are responsible for them, I really believe that that has to be part of the trip.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1548.825s">So</a>  I read your itinerary and I love that you included the community service aspect in between the Salsa dancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1558.471s">I</a>  thought it was a really good balance and I love that you put the educational piece in with all the fun and giving back to other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1567.797s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1568.738s">I</a>  was very impressed with it, and I just wanted to make that comment to you.</p>

    <p>[CUpSL015tZc_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1571.92s">I've</a>  traveled with four or five companies through the years, and this is the one company I have been the most impressed with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1578.464s">The</a>  first time I went to Puerto Rico, I took 38 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1582.786s">There</a>  were two chaperones from the company with us in addition to the chaperones that I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1588.709s">We</a>  also had a car following us at all times in case of an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1594.727s">And</a>  Puerto Rico is like being here in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1597.729s">CVS,</a>  Walgreens, everything is everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1600.411s">So</a>  we did have to tap that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1603.933s">One</a>  student forgot her medication, so we were able to get medication for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1608.717s">Another</a>  interesting thing was I had to take a student to the dentist. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1613.12s">And</a>  I know you can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1615.001s">And</a>  I said, I never thought I'd be traveling with students going to a dentist.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1621.173s">I</a>  just never know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1622.473s">I</a>  really love that service piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1626.014s">I</a>  think the kids will come home with more than just trinkets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1630.256s">They'll</a>  come home with more self-esteem in the fact that they gave back to a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1636.277s">Kids</a>  at my school go to Guatemala every year for three weeks and they work in a school and they come back different people.</p>

    <p>[CUpSL015tZc_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1643.879s">It</a>  opens up their eyes and I know a lot of my students have all done the semester abroad or the year abroad. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1650.392s">And</a>  they've always said that these trips that we offer at Medford High have really given them that taste, that sense of confidence to do that.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1659.338s">It's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1660.079s">Thank</a>  you for offering it to our children.</p>

    <p>[CUpSL015tZc_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1662.24s">Well,</a>  I love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1663.221s">I</a>  really enjoy seeing it through their eyes.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1665.822s">On</a>  the motion, all those in favor, say aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1670.926s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1671.366s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1671.746s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1672.127s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1674.648s">Have</a>  a great time.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1675.349s">OK,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1676.61s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1692.914s">Report</a>  on the Metro Vocational School open house, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1696.815s">Mr.</a>  Chair and members of the committee, most of you attended the open house of the vocational school, so it speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1703.917s">I</a>  think it was an outstanding presentation by the vocational school faculty, the director, all the staff up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1710.46s">The</a>  new health assisting program was outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1715.725s">revamp</a>  of the facilities and other matters really stood out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1720.209s">Vocational</a>  school is definitely on the move. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1722.71s">Our</a>  director, Heidi Rich here, would have been here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1725.252s">Unfortunately,</a>  her mother passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1726.894s">I</a>  have a notice in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1731.757s">Her</a>  name is Elaine Donahue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1734.92s">Arrangements</a>  are Wednesday night and Thursday up in Lawrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1740.588s">So</a>  I'm not going to go into that report tonight except to say that if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1746.352s">Otherwise,</a>  we'll save it for another time when Heidi can be with us and talk to you more completely about our vocational initiatives.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1752.975s">Mr.</a>  Mayor, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1755.577s">I</a>  just want to say, first of all, our condolences to Heidi and to her family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1760.019s">But</a>  also, I got a lot of feedback that night from people that had come up and toured the vocational school, and they were very, very impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1770.406s">A</a>  lot of parents that have students in eighth grade that came up to the open house, they were really impressed on how things have changed and the opportunities that the students are having. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1780.502s">So</a>  I just want to take the time out to say thank you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1783.204s">Riccio,</a>  to our staff, and to the school, because it has changed quite a bit in a very short time.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2367.603s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2370.266s">To</a>  commemorate Veterans Day, the Humanities Department and the Office of Veterans Services worked together to sponsor the annual Veterans Day speaker program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2378.896s">In</a>  its 15th year, this program provides high school students and faculty with the opportunity to directly interact with veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2387.462s">Veterans</a>  visit high school classrooms discussing with students their combat and non-combat related experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2394.643s">The</a>  program is an enormously rewarding experience for all involved, our students, faculty, and honored veteran guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2401.865s">This</a>  year's event took place on Thursday, November 5th, and was co-coordinated by the Director of Veteran Services, Mr. Ernest Lindsay, the Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, and lead social studies teacher, Nicholas Kane. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2417.597s">The</a>  day began at 7.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2419.239s">in</a>  the superintendent's conference room with a light breakfast of coffee, donuts, juice, muffins, and fruit donated by Dunkin' Donuts in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2427.767s">I</a>  will say that Dunkin' Donuts in West Medford has been donating goods for this event for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2434.214s">We're</a>  very, very thankful to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2437.576s">Sandwiches</a>  and various salads were provided by the food services department at the high school for lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2443.361s">21</a>  veterans from several eras, including the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and the Iraq War, visited 38 classes and gave an overview of their military experiences and contributions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2455.775s">I</a>  will tell you that this year I noticed for the first time we had no World War II veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2460.5s">It's</a>  the first year in the 15 years that it has been running that none were able to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2468.069s">I</a>  know that Ernest Lindsay did reach out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2470.672s">I</a>  know in one case he just didn't get a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2472.974s">We</a>  do not know what happened to that veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2475.509s">In</a>  other cases, I know several of them have passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2477.752s">So</a>  I thought that was particularly sad, especially since I've been with the program first as a teacher and then as an administrator since its beginning in 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2489.336s">This</a>  program provided our students with an authentic oral history of personal experiences that will enhance their study of history in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2497.338s">Feedback</a>  from students, teachers, and veterans from this year's program was overwhelmingly positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2503.7s">On</a>  the attachment, you can see a list of the veterans who did participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2507.342s">And</a>  as was mentioned a little bit earlier, one of the veterans passed away soon after the presentation, and that was Mr. Michael Geiselman. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2519.508s">I</a>  would be happy to take any questions at this point.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2522.21s">Mr.</a>  Mayor, through you to the superintendent, can we send a letter from the school committee thanking them for their time for our students? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2532.378s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bernadette Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2534.375s">We</a>  do typically do that, and so on the thank you note, the thank you notes go out from each one of the classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2543.059s">Sometimes</a>  the class will provide one card with many signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2547.641s">Other</a>  classes use it as a writing experience, and they write individual letters to the veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2553.263s">There's</a>  a certificate that typically goes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2555.584s">It's</a>  signed by the mayor, the superintendent, and it will be signed by the director of humanities, Nicole Chiesa. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2560.887s">Oh,</a>  that's great.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2562.611s">I</a>  think that's great, and I thank them for their service both to our country and to our school children.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2752.788s">Just</a>  a quick comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2753.732s">I'm</a>  glad that Massachusetts is still <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2756.469s">ranked</a>  so highly through our nation, but we, globally, our country needs to be aware and invest money into education because we don't want to lose our position there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2767.116s">And</a>  our scores have gone down, not Massachusetts, all scores a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2771.959s">And</a>  it's, I know that they're not expecting those type of scores to go down, but we, we only, we are doing well within the United States, but we need to up our game because we compete globally now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2783.746s">It's</a>  a global world. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2785.315s">Um,</a>  thank you for the statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2786.997s">It</a>  was a great read and I'm glad that Massachusetts is still stuck at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2791.761s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2804.724s">Mr.</a>  Mayor and members of the committee, as we are here this evening, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Board is meeting in Malden discussing the recommendations of Commissioner Chester to implement a hybrid <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2823.754s">test</a>  that would combine MCAS as we know it and PARC as it is emergent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2830.24s">And</a>  he's calling that MCAS 2.0. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2834.304s">Now</a>  there's going to be a lot of people on different sides of the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2837.006s">There'll</a>  be people that <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2839.735s">are</a>  recommending that MCAS be the standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2843.836s">There'll</a>  be people recommending that PARC replace MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2847.317s">There'll</a>  be people supporting the commissioner's position for a hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2850.858s">And</a>  there'll be people arguing that testing should go away altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2854.839s">It's</a>  going to be very interesting over the next couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2858.059s">I</a>  had the opportunity to talk to the Secretary of Education, James Pizer, on Saturday evening at the Children's Trust event. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2865.321s">And</a>  we talked a little bit about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2866.581s">But</a>  I suspect that the board will probably approve <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2870.251s">MCAS</a>  2.0. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2872.532s">I</a>  suspect that's what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2874.653s">The</a>  bigger issue is how is this going to roll out, and who's going to take what, and when, and how much preparation is going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2882.396s">According</a>  to the commissioner's approach, if you've done MCAS in the past, you can continue to do MCAS for one more year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2890.058s">They</a>  might work in a few park type questions in there to try it out to see how people do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2895.2s">If</a>  you were doing park, you'll continue to take park. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2901.258s">and</a>  there'll be some rollout activities, but the subsequent year, MCAS 2.0 would be the Commissioner's recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2908.885s">I</a>  suspect that's what's going to count, but I don't know that for a fact as we stand here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2914.711s">I've</a>  also provided you some comparative results between <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2919.965s">MCAS</a>  and PARCC, and you can see that PARCC did not achieve as much in terms of student proficiency as MCAS did, because PARCC is allegedly a much more difficult, deeper thinking type test. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2935.039s">Whether</a>  you agree or disagree that testing <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2938.234s">It</a>  should take place or how much testing should take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2941.397s">We're</a>  going to get some answers at least over the next couple of days to at least get an idea of where the state wants to head. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2947.942s">But</a>  I suspect the debate is going to continue for a long period of time as to how it's going to roll out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2953.62s">and</a>  what it all means to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2957.182s">I</a>  provided you with a lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2958.943s">I</a>  don't want to go through every page of it unless you have specific questions, and I'll be happy to address those specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2966.366s">And</a>  if we want to hold a larger meeting or a committee of the whole on it, once we know what the state has actually done, I think that would be a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2973.87s">Mr.</a>  Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2978.077s">I</a>  just had a few comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2979.158s">First</a>  of all, I really appreciated the data that you attached to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2982.779s">I</a>  found it very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2985.08s">So</a>  I just want the community to know that we would probably be continuing with MCAS since we did MCAS last year and we wouldn't take on the park at this moving forward because that program hasn't been approved yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2998.906s">My</a>  second thing is the information about the cost of producing these tests <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3007.124s">$37</a>  million is down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3009.846s">It's</a>  amazing to me how much money we are spending as a commonwealth for a test as opposed to spending it actually on education. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3020.601s">It's</a>  just a personal comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3022.962s">And</a>  they're not even sure how much it's going to cost to develop our own new MCAS 2.0. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3029.226s">So</a>  I'm going to be watching this closely and trying to be a strong voice and advocate for our students through the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3037.391s">As</a>  I know you will, Mr. Superintendent, I know you have the ear of a lot of our state people who are making these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3044.735s">So</a>  I would like you to keep us informed on any changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3050.119s">And</a>  make sure we make the proper decisions for our children and our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3055.463s">Mr.</a>  Chairman?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3099.762s">I</a>  provided you with a fairly substantial package on school security issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3105.248s">I'm</a>  going to go over some key points, make some recommendations, and then certainly I'm wide open to any comments you want to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3112.617s">The</a>  only thing I would suggest is that I'm not going to go into <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3117.415s">very</a>  deep protocols because if I do that, I release information that should be kept tightly because it affects the safety and security of the operation of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3129.702s">I</a>  will answer broader questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3132.604s">We</a>  have the principal of McGlynn and the principal of McGlynn Elementary with us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3138.348s">We</a>  have our director of elementary education here this evening to direct, to answer any questions that might be directed to that specific incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3145.992s">This</a>  report is divided into five parts to enable us to better focus on the specific elements of our current school security plans and possible enhancements to the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3158.535s">This</a>  report has multiple attachments to further describe and explain both current and possible security measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3166.057s">The</a>  first part is devoted to the McGlynn incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3169.177s">The</a>  second is the current security measures in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3172.618s">The</a>  third is proposed additional security measures <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3176.688s">The</a>  fourth is about challenges, and the fifth area provides attachments that speak to the issues of security, safety, and provide you with ideas that we may or may not implement in your direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3194.46s">Now,</a>  on October 30th, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3200.4s">2015,</a>  an unauthorized female adult entered the McGuinn School through the middle school side entrance around 12.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3209.242s">She</a>  entered at the same time that seventh grade students were returning from recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3213.764s">The</a>  door through which she entered was monitored by a lunch attendant and a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3218.525s">However,</a>  she was not challenged at the point of entry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3221.666s">She</a>  then proceeded to the elementary side of the building and encountered a teacher who asked, may I help you? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3227.547s">The</a>  intruder responded she was just looking for a pen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3230.891s">and</a>  she was not redirected to the main entrance or further challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3235.373s">During</a>  the next half hour, she went in and out of elementary classrooms and stole money, approximately $800 in total, from six different teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3244.538s">The</a>  individual then left the building through the back door. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3248.82s">No</a>  teacher or students were in the classrooms that she entered. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3252.491s">her</a>  progression into the parking lot, entrance into the school, movement throughout the school, exit, and drive away from the parking lot were captured on the school's video camera surveillance system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3264.218s">The</a>  theft was reported by teachers to the elementary principal, Diane Guarino, in the afternoon after the students had left for the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3271.983s">Principal</a>  Guarino reported that the theft to the superintendent who instructed her to file a police report. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3277.727s">It</a>  was not clear at this time as to whether this was an inside or an outside job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3283.01s">On</a>  Monday, Alan Arena, our network administrator, reviewed the video surveillance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3287.232s">There</a>  was multiple hours of video surveillance during that period. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3290.394s">It</a>  identified the presence of the female intruder. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3293.896s">The</a>  tape was provided to the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3295.357s">The</a>  police shared the tape images with area police departments to alert them of possible persons of interest or person of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3304.782s">The</a>  information was picked up by Fox Media as they monitored these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3311.843s">Fox</a>  began its coverage of the incident sometime Tuesday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3316.006s">Superintendent</a>  spoke with Fox on Tuesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3319.629s">I</a>  emailed the school committee members in the early evening of that day describing the incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3325.054s">Tuesday</a>  was a professional day in our school, so no students were present. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3329.677s">The</a>  incident was not reported by the school administration from the outset to enable the police to proceed with their pursuit of the intruder, who probably did not know that she was on surveillance tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3340.319s">We</a>  also hope to avoid any panic or anxiety for parents coming to the school since students were not endangered at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3347.004s">The</a>  building administration intensified their security measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3351.828s">As</a>  of this time, the police have not identified the intruder. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3354.75s">The</a>  superintendent then met with all principals and reviewed security protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3360.654s">Responses</a>  were provided to email inquiries in the local press, and letters were sent home to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3366.358s">You</a>  have a copy of the letter sent home from McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3369.617s">The</a>  incident at McGlynn was not taken lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3372.318s">It</a>  resulted from human error. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3374.639s">No</a>  unauthorized person should ever be allowed to enter the school without being challenged and redirected to security. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3382.102s">This</a>  element is correctable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3384.823s">Our</a>  schools are busy places, and there are many individuals who must come and go on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3391.006s">Unknown,</a>  unauthorized persons must always be stopped, challenged, and redirected to security. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3397.262s">I</a>  want to talk now about some of the current measures of security in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3402.625s">The</a>  Metro Public Schools take security very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3406.147s">We</a>  were founding members of NMLEC, the Northeast Metropolitan Law Enforcement Council, and the STARS program, right after Columbine, that linked police to the schools on both a local and regional basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3418.553s">Chief</a>  Sacco was the head of the task force, and I served on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3423.856s">All</a>  main buildings of our schools have the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3427.049s">documented</a>  security emergency plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3430.05s">They</a>  conduct periodic drills at each building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3433.731s">They</a>  have coordinated detailed war plans that were paid for by the STARS system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3438.693s">There</a>  are surveillance cameras, door monitoring and main door buzzer systems, shared police resource officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3448.216s">We</a>  have the Nemlick STARS program, which allows us to call upon resources at a regional level. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3453.11s">in</a>  various types of capacities, everything from graphic analysis to psychological analysis to anything to a SWAT team. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3462.612s">Various</a>  IDs and sign-in requirements exist in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3466.973s">We</a>  have new enhanced phone systems that went in this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3471.053s">Walkie-talkies</a>  and cell phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3473.934s">911</a>  access from any part of the buildings now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3477.154s">Emergency</a>  medical plans, which you received earlier in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3481.853s">Principles</a>  met with the superintendent and have reinforced the following in each building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3487.256s">One,</a>  all doors must be locked at all times unless they are being monitored by an assigned member of the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3495.88s">Two,</a>  non-authorized individuals entering or traveling into our buildings must be stopped and questioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3502.384s">They</a>  should be escorted to the main office for signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3505.586s">Three,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3506.898s">Building</a>  guests must be wearing an appropriate ID badge issued by the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3511.22s">If</a>  there is resistance or concern, then assistance must be requested by notifying the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3517.704s">The</a>  office must be alerted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3518.964s">Number</a>  four, if you see any strangers or suspicious individuals around or near the playground, if necessary, at the end of recess, bring students, end recess rather than bring students into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3533.092s">Five,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3534.095s">For</a>  those staff members who are providing services to outside students, please provide the main office a schedule of those appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3542.218s">The</a>  main office will call to your room when they arrive so you can escort them from your office to the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3548.401s">Six,</a>  those staff members who hold after school detentions, after school academic support, band practice, and the like, must be stationed at the door as students are exiting the building in order to ensure no individuals are entering the building unauthorized. <a

href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3568.822s">The</a>  office will support the staff member and call for police backup at 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3572.826s">A</a>  report will be filed for the principal and the principal will notify the superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3580.386s">Now,</a>  regular CBJ meetings, community-based justice meetings, are held weekly to review situations that require special attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3588.896s">These</a>  happen with the police, the district attorney's office, and some of the social service agencies to go over anything happening on the street on weekends, happening in the courts, that might affect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3600.935s">And</a>  we talk about those with our principals and we provide information should there be anyone in their area or anything going on in the neighborhood or anything happening in the weekend that requires special attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3614.623s">Some</a>  proposed additional security measures in addition to existing measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3619.026s">One,</a>  we are going to implement an enhanced ID system, the Raptor prototype. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3624.629s">I</a>  can't say Raptor right now because it has to be put out through the procurement process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3629.543s">But</a>  you have in your packet here a detailed explanation of the Raptor system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3637.208s">The</a>  Raptor system currently exists at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3641.171s">It</a>  is a system in which all visitors will have a picture pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3646.155s">So</a>  you take your license out or some other government ID, you put it into the system, and it prints a pass that goes on your clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3657.873s">The</a>  cost is about $2,000 per building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3660.614s">The</a>  vocational school is in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3664.516s">We</a>  will implement and install a security alert system at all main doors to provide rapid response when needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3671.379s">We'll</a>  have available to the person as the security person a alert buzzer that will allow them to make an immediate call to an individual who can then make a 911 call. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3682.184s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3686.513s">There</a>  are different proprietary systems available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3690.797s">Once</a>  again, we need to go through the procurement process to identify which one will be installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3697.462s">And</a>  that will happen very quickly, because we'll move through an emergency process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3701.826s">We'll</a>  consider selective placement of additional building monitors at the high school complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3706.97s">Why</a>  the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3707.63s">37</a>  doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3711.412s">Most</a>  schools only have a handful of doors that they can be monitored. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3714.674s">The</a>  high school is much larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3717.036s">Many</a>  more possibilities exist for entrance and exit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3721.239s">We</a>  will insist on uniform dress for all security personnel, people or monitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3725.282s">We</a>  will then provide them with proper attire, not police attire, but proper attire to identify them as building monitors, officials of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3736.89s">Five.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3737.793s">will</a>  improve notification with school committee and parents when incidents occur consistent with best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3743.534s">Superintendent</a>  made a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3746.835s">Obviously,</a>  it was not something that everyone agrees with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3751.397s">I</a>  understand your need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3753.677s">I</a>  certainly will ramp it up and take your guidance on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3756.718s">The</a>  only thing I ask from you is that if you get certain secure information, that it stays with you as opposed to anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3765.221s">because</a>  when we are in pursuit of an intruder or anyone, or something is going on in an investigation, I need to maintain a certain level of confidentiality consistent with best police practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3776.907s">But</a>  you're entitled to know, that's my area, I accept responsibility for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3782.01s">We</a>  have challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3784.711s">High</a>  school is a very large facility, with many doors, points of entry, and multiple all-day programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3793.307s">Every</a>  assembly, every activity, people coming in for concerts, people coming in for athletic events. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3797.733s">You</a>  can't stop everybody all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3802.279s">We</a>  don't want to make the environment not conducive for learning, or not a friendly atmosphere. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3806.905s">We</a>  don't want people to be driven away. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3808.888s">Well,</a>  at the same token, we need to maintain vigilance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3811.779s">and</a>  have people who know who should be coming in and know who should not be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3815.8s">But</a>  we have ballgames, we have visitors who come from other schools, who come from other areas, press, other people that come into our world. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3823.963s">Special</a>  events at every school where reasonable access is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3828.104s">Bus</a>  transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3829.964s">We</a>  have buses moving throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3832.345s">Outdoor</a>  events, many outdoor events. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3835.706s">Maintenance</a>  of security cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3837.727s">We</a>  have a lot of security cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3839.684s">But</a>  to keep them up and doing everything they need to do is a cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3844.447s">And</a>  we'll probably have to pay that cost every year so that there are a few cameras that go down every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3851.411s">We're</a>  going to have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3853.772s">We'll</a>  have to upgrade some of them from time to time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3856.934s">Sometimes</a>  they're affected by weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3858.995s">Sometimes</a>  they're affected by other factors that we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3862.377s">But</a>  clearly, there's a cost that we're going to have to make a line item for to ensure that they're in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3869.407s">And</a>  then we have to have the most important thing, the uniform and diligent implementation of security protocols by all faculty and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3878.133s">Human</a>  error, human implementation is our best source of protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3885.377s">You</a>  see something that isn't right, you don't ask, you report it and let it get checked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3893.743s">I'm</a>  gonna give you a little example today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3897.096s">Today,</a>  an individual in the back of the high school was going to put something in the dumpster, and they put a bag down on the ground next to their car as they went to do one other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3909.104s">Immediately,</a>  they got calls, and Jimmy Ricciardi was out there picking up the bag, checking it out, and make sure it wasn't something that shouldn't be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3918.43s">People</a>  have to be vigilant. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3921.291s">Some</a>  of these things will be overkill. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3924.834s">But</a>  if you see something that doesn't look right, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3927.626s">You</a>  need to respond, and everyone has to take that seriously, because there's no other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3932.907s">There's</a>  no other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3936.408s">I've</a>  provided some attachments for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3938.829s">The</a>  Metro Public Schools Crisis Response Manual. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3941.269s">It's</a>  very substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3942.99s">Now,</a>  there are some pages in there that are part of another manual that are, like, for example, floor plans and the like, which aren't included in here, but that's confidential to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3953.27s">The</a>  Massachusetts School Safety and Security Task Force report that came out in 2014 under Governor Deval Patrick and his safety officials suggested procedures by a responsive, or let's say a respected expert in the area on threat assessment in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3972.694s">We</a>  provided you with a copy of the sample emergency response procedures at the McGlynn School that every teacher has in their possession. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3981.407s">I've</a>  given you a copy of the Raptor prototype ID system to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3986.008s">And</a>  you have a letter from the McGuinn parents, or sent to the McGuinn parents by the elementary principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=3995.832s">The</a>  safety of our students and staff is our highest priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4001.733s">While</a>  there are challenges, we have many important security elements in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4006.135s">We'll</a>  work together with our principals, teachers, staff, parents, law enforcement, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4010.249s">and</a>  community partners to enhance our capacity going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4014.933s">There's</a>  no perfect system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4016.994s">We</a>  live in a very dangerous world in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4023.039s">But</a>  we do everything we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4024.52s">And</a>  we're open to additional suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4027.683s">But</a>  I don't think there's a silver bullet out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4029.644s">I</a>  don't think adding 10 more people to every school or another person there is going to change everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4035.669s">I</a>  think it's going to be selective and targeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4038.484s">The</a>  biggest single factor will be making sure that everyone who works in the schools is a first responder, alerts people when they see something, and follows every protocol as they're laid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4052.293s">Mr.</a>  Mayor, I'm prepared to take any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4054.114s">Mr.</a>  Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4054.554s">Mrs.</a>  Vanden Heuvel.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4057.356s">So</a>  this is a real tough one because, to me, it suggests clearly a weakness. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4069.078s">And</a>  I'm grateful that in this particular case, the weakness only resulted in a theft of some money and nothing more severe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4076.141s">I</a>  am very concerned from the report that I received to understand, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I have to lay it at your feet, Mr. Superintendent, that you were informed of this on Friday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4089.867s">You</a>  directed Principal Garino to file a report with the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4094.073s">And</a>  it wasn't until Monday that someone looked at the videotape. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4101.477s">Now,</a>  I understand it was Friday night, but I can't believe that someone didn't go in and arrange the proper people to look at the videotape so that on Monday morning, all of our principals would have been assessed of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4118.806s">All</a>  of us, everybody would have been alerted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4120.987s">I</a>  understand that there was a concern of keeping <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4123.868s">the</a>  identity and the incident under wraps so that police could start. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4129.953s">But</a>  wouldn't the police have wanted to see the video on Friday night as opposed to Monday morning? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4135.577s">Could</a>  you please address that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4136.498s">Because</a>  I can't fathom it.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4140.06s">So</a>  again, it's probably something that could have been done, maybe should have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4147.586s">Take</a>  the criticism. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4149.597s">But</a>  clearly, you know, we have certain people who are expert at certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4154.721s">And</a>  there was a distinct feeling that it was an inside job, because no one saw anyone come and go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4161.485s">It</a>  came afterwards when we did see the video, and we did file the police report. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4166.449s">So</a>  I'll take your criticism as something that we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4170.551s">You</a>  know, simply a void in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4172.252s">We</a>  have to deal with it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4173.272s">Well,</a>  I can't, I mean, I for one say, you know, take the criticism, you drop the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4178.734s">And</a>  I truly believe that there was not a sense of urgency, it seems to me, on this incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4187.19s">Again,</a>  I'm grateful that the incident stopped where it stopped, and it wasn't something more severe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4192.071s">I</a>  understand that we've had protocols in place, and I do understand the human error part of it with the people who allowed the individual to go about the building without being escorted down to the office, which is what our policy calls for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4207.436s">But</a>  the fact of the matter is that once there was a known incident, it needed and deserved immediate attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4214.811s">need</a>  to be sent, wait until Monday morning to figure out that it was, in fact, someone from the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4220.916s">And</a>  I am deeply disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4223.117s">I</a>  was reading this and sighing and groaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4227.02s">And</a>  my husband said, you know, that's what the problem is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4230.042s">The</a>  problem is it always hurts the most when it's people you really respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4233.985s">And</a>  I really respect you, but I really think you blew it.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4237.268s">Mr.</a>  Chairman.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4242.17s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, I, too, am deeply disturbed, especially when a teacher and a lunch attendant just let this person walk in cavalierly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4250.753s">What</a>  type of training do we have in place to alert teachers and lunch attendants and whoever else may be in the building that we employ? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4258.676s">If</a>  you see somebody that you don't know, ask them why they're there and ask them to identify themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4264.058s">This</a>  goes back 10 or 15 years when I've always asked for IDs for our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4270.411s">teachers</a>  and the like, and somehow it got shuffled off until recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4274.475s">You</a>  know, that in itself should have been a wake-up call years ago that we need to know what's coming and going from our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4282.061s">You</a>  know, the taxpayers spend an awful lot of money to get these buildings done, and we just can't have every Tom, Dick, and Harry waltzing in and out as they may.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4291.549s">So</a>  the RID systems in the schools, they're just not as uniform as they will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4297.962s">with</a>  the Raptor system or the Raptor prototype system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4301.564s">We</a>  certainly need to do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4304.025s">The</a>  principals drill and run practices, you know, with their staff to go over these things at the beginning of the year, during the year, and still can't necessarily guarantee there won't be human error, but we certainly have made this an emphasis point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4321.752s">Maybe</a>  sometimes adversity, especially if it didn't result in something much more difficult, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4328.475s">can</a>  further intensify the need for everyone to follow up intelligently and follow up more intensively. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4335.396s">So,</a>  again, take the criticism as something instructive, and we'll work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4341.578s">We'll</a>  work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4342.498s">You</a>  can see from what we're proposing, we're not taking this lightly at all.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4346.359s">Is</a>  there a policy in effect that the teacher and the lunch attendant should have known that people just can't waltz in the door at recess time? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4353.16s">Everybody</a>  who comes in should be challenged.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4380.029s">Just</a>  because you give somebody a manual doesn't mean they're going to read it.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4382.866s">No,</a>  we go over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4383.726s">We</a>  go over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4384.307s">I</a>  mean, you know, I have the principals of the McGlynn here tonight, and they can tell you what they do specifically if you care to talk to them about it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4390.649s">Do</a>  the individuals sign off upon receipt and indicate that they have read it and they understand what's in it?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4396.532s">Well,</a>  they don't sign off.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4398.393s">Well,</a>  I think that should be a policy.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4400.614s">Maybe</a>  that's something we ought to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4402.335s">Take</a>  that as a piece of guidance.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4405.316s">God</a>  forbid something happened to a child. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4407.217s">It</a>  would be on all our minds.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4409.538s">Well,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4410.938s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4412.695s">This</a>  is not an excuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4413.796s">It's</a>  not an attempt to duck anything, but these buildings have been in place for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4421.7s">This</a>  is the first incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4423.641s">It</a>  doesn't make it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4425.061s">It's</a>  the first incident, and we can learn from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4427.723s">We</a>  will learn from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4428.643s">We</a>  are learning from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4429.564s">We're</a>  doing things about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4430.664s">So</a>  I take your criticism, and we'll work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4432.565s">No,</a>  but Mr. Superintendent, this shouldn't have been a first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4434.846s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4435.887s">This</a>  should not have been a first.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4440.109s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4444.118s">Uh,</a>  this is very, uh, concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4447.14s">Um,</a>  I, I didn't like the way I learned about it, but, uh, for me, it's about moving forward and trying to prevent it from happening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4455.247s">And,</a>  uh, I do think that my colleague did bring up a very good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4459.71s">And</a>  I think that, you know, having everyone in the system, all staff and administrators, everyone reading the policy and then signing off on the policy that they have read it and they understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4471.88s">If</a>  they have any questions, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4473.475s">they</a>  should ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4474.295s">So</a>  I think that is a very good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4475.715s">I</a>  know that's something that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4477.276s">I</a>  know I do it professionally at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4478.636s">We</a>  have different policies that we do have to adhere to and we have to sign off on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4481.517s">So</a>  I think that's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4483.877s">With</a>  regard to, I know you have communicated to the principals about the different policies and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4493.339s">Have</a>  the principals had staff meetings with each individual building to communicate to their staff</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4504.309s">The</a>  policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4505.35s">I</a>  think we have two principles here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4506.932s">Let</a>  them address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4507.794s">Let</a>  them tell you how they do it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4510.177s">If</a>  you could please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4511.458s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4512.119s">Because</a>  everybody has their own style a little bit, but certainly, you know, the message is the same.</p>

    <p>[lq25S5HOVFA_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4518.848s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4519.739s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4520.359s">A</a>  couple things I'd like to say about this, because certainly the superintendent has shown fabulous leadership in this area since I've been principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4527.841s">This</a>  is my seventh year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4529.082s">We</a>  talk about it consistently every year at all of our meetings we mention it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4534.403s">We</a>  work hard at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4536.404s">We</a>  started reinforcing our plans when I became principal, and we all worked as a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4543.926s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4544.226s">Andrews</a>  was very instrumental, who's now the assistant principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4546.766s">She</a>  was my guidance Councilor at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4549.571s">This</a>  was a fluke, I will tell you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4552.312s">And</a>  one of the things I want you to be aware of, because I take responsibility for this too, I assign those people at that door. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4558.174s">That</a>  door is no longer used and will never be used again. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4560.655s">I</a>  will be at the door every recess or Mr. Charles making sure that only our kids are coming in one door. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4567.238s">So</a>  we've changed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4568.938s">But</a>  this individual, the lunch lady, works very hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4571.499s">She</a>  knows all the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4572.7s">She's</a>  been there for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4574.16s">She</a>  does a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4575.101s">She</a>  alerts me to things all the time, as do my staff consistently. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4579.342s">Even</a>  if they think it's nothing, I tell them all the time, it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4583.365s">You</a>  tell me about it, I will figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4585.347s">We'll</a>  work together to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4587.188s">There</a>  is consistent communication along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4590.351s">This</a>  particular individual certainly knew what they were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4593.934s">They</a>  knew a weak spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4595.695s">They</a>  also knew the time and the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4597.956s">They</a>  had some information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4599.537s">She</a>  also, this person, looks identical to one of my 7th graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4603.58s">If</a>  I showed you back to back pictures, you may not be able to tell them apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4607.742s">And</a>  I think that's what happened in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4610.544s">It</a>  shouldn't have happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4611.585s">It</a>  will not happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4612.725s">I</a>  take responsibility for it happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4616.486s">Now</a>  we have one door that we come in from recess near the basketball court. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4621.691s">It</a>  was a traffic flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4622.912s">That's</a>  why we wanted to make sure that our kids weren't bumping into the elementary kids at lunch line and that our kids were not bumping into each other going up the stairway. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4632.102s">Middle</a>  schoolers can be clumsy going up and down the stairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4634.324s">We</a>  had some kids falling and we wanted to kind of even the flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4638.949s">But</a>  now we have a different policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4640.31s">And</a>  it's okay because in our world today, some inconveniences, some patients, to have more security, that's the way we have to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4648.674s">And</a>  that's the way we're going to handle things from now on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4654.145s">Have</a>  you met with your staff since the incident? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4656.527s">We</a>  both have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4657.107s">We've</a>  done a lot of drills this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4659.189s">Even</a>  before this happened, they were all scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4661.711s">We've</a>  done many fire drills every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4664.113s">We</a>  did an evacuation drill. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4665.694s">We've</a>  done a shelter in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4667.295s">This</a>  Friday, we'll do a full lockdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4669.237s">We'll</a>  also do cafeteria lockdowns.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4672.179s">So</a>  I'm glad that you're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4675.201s">I</a>  think you always have to be prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4677.703s">So</a>  it's good that you've gone through those drills. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4682.225s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, have the other administrator principals met with their, yes, with their building, with their staff and they've notified everybody of their protocols and whatnot.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4694.747s">Everyone</a>  has been instructed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4696.968s">They</a>  were told to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4699.408s">I</a>  believe they've done it based on the information I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4703.489s">I'm</a>  sure everyone does it slightly differently, but I will take that idea about sign off very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4710.402s">make</a>  sure that, you know, I get those. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4711.983s">I</a>  did have the principal sign off to me on a document, you know, that they had done what they were supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4719.127s">Um,</a>  I believe every building is covered and I believe they run regular drills. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4723.13s">I</a>  know they do.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4724.43s">I</a>  know they run regular drills. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4725.631s">I</a>  just want to make sure that since this incident that, you know, they, each building principal has met with your staff to let them know this has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4733.556s">This</a>  is what we want to go over the protocols again to make sure it doesn't happen in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4737.938s">It</a>  doesn't happen in any building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4739.418s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4739.819s">We</a>  had a very, very productive meeting with the principals and then we told them to go back and make sure everyone knew what was expected of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4747.89s">And</a>  I believe everyone did it with diligence.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4751.015s">Mr.</a>  Edwards, if I may, in your school, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4753.714s">Are</a>  the students required to wear IDs or have IDs on there?</p>

    <p>[lq25S5HOVFA_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4757.716s">We</a>  did try that one year, because we do get the IDs from Life Touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4762.019s">But</a>  middle schoolers, so there was always 100 to 150 who did not have their IDs every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4767.682s">So</a>  now what do we do with those students? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4769.843s">Because</a>  middle schoolers forget things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4771.203s">They</a>  forget their pencils. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4772.464s">They</a>  forgot their IDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4774.085s">A</a>  lot of them wore them proudly, but many of them did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4776.827s">They</a>  lost them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4777.887s">Some</a>  of them don't get their pictures taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4779.728s">They</a>  don't show up on that day to get their pictures taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4781.869s">They</a>  don't show up for retakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4783.45s">So</a>  it was difficult to implement that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4785.552s">If</a>  we could certainly try it again, I'd be happy to.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4788.794s">I</a>  mean, just from my personal experience, my son goes to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4791.295s">They</a>  have IDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4792.316s">I</a>  assume they're the same type. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4794.698s">I</a>  think it's something that we should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4796.659s">I</a>  think this middle school and up should have IDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4799.501s">I</a>  think if there's an emergency in the building, you kind of know right away if someone belongs or not if they have their ID. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4806.245s">And</a>  if they don't come to school with the ID that day, then maybe they're issued a temporary ID. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4811.903s">I</a>  think it's a good way of knowing who belongs in the building and who doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4815.164s">Same</a>  thing with teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4816.044s">They</a>  should have IDs on them at all times as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4819.324s">I</a>  just think it's an indicator right away of who belongs in the building and who doesn't belong in the building.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4823.525s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4825.305s">Mr.</a>  Schapiro. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4825.965s">I</a>  know that the school system that I work in, we have the X2 system, where if a child does forget their ID, that the homeroom teacher would print a picture that's provided with them <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4842.173s">at</a>  the beginning of the year, and it's the student's information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4846.134s">And</a>  I think that, I concur with what Mr. Falco and Mr. Skerry were saying, that I think that's something that, because if you saw some protocols as a former teacher, then we were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4856.996s">I</a>  know how hard you work in preparing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4859.897s">There</a>  were safes that the teacher did stop the person, but a simple ID would have stopped everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4872.592s">I</a>  don't have a pen that doesn't answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4874.532s">You</a>  don't have your ID on, you get to the office, period.</p>

    <p>[lq25S5HOVFA_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4878.673s">And</a>  most of the time that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4880.954s">I'm</a>  alerted to people in the hallways all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4884.534s">And</a>  sometimes I say, well, we don't want to upset them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4886.355s">It's</a>  OK to upset them and blame it on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4888.235s">I'll</a>  handle that when they get down from the main office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4890.276s">It's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4891.216s">Anything</a>  for safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4892.576s">The</a>  other thing I want you to be aware of, and this is not to have an excuse at all, but that Mrs. Guarino and I were in the building that Friday evening till after 9 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4902.518s">I'm</a>  going to give you a little bit of background on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4917.87s">Mr.</a>  Scala and I used to be detectives trying to find these things a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4921.514s">So</a>  we did not know that it was somebody from the outside at that time, but we did try everything we could to come up with the information that we needed to come up with to kind of eliminate those possibilities that it was somebody who was in at a meeting, a parent perhaps that day.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4938.209s">Mr.</a>  Mayor, I have one last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4940.391s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, with regard to the challenges, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4944.385s">Uh,</a>  the first one is the high school and how it's a large facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4947.266s">So</a>  I believe you said this 37 points of entry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4952.107s">So</a>  have we, have we, uh, thought about possibly seeking security advice from a security consultant or from Medford police as to how to safeguard that facility? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4964.131s">I</a>  mean, 37 points of entry, that's a large number of points of entry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4968.973s">I</a>  mean, I'm just thinking like, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4971.101s">someone</a>  that specializes in that would probably at least be able to give some sort of a professional opinion on how to secure it, or?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4979.084s">We've</a>  had multiple meetings on this over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4981.225s">The</a>  high school is, what, 45 years old now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4983.286s">Mm-hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4984.206s">So</a>  at one time, as you may or may not remember, we had a whole CETA security force. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4989.809s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4989.969s">Mr.</a>  LaPorta was directing the team, and we even had a guardhouse at the middle of the hill coming up Steve Miller Drive before it was Steve Miller Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4998.192s">We've</a>  had a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=4999.673s">We've</a>  gone over those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5001.823s">There</a>  are fire laws about exits and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5005.105s">And,</a>  you know, again, we've had a lot of discussions about things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5009.228s">People</a>  have come in and told us to use wands and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5011.67s">But</a>  you can't turn the place into a prison. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5014.732s">You</a>  have to turn the place into an educational institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5017.854s">So</a>  we can certainly look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5019.155s">I'd</a>  be happy to bring in someone else to have another discussion with that, along with the police chief and others, and see if we can't come up with something that gives us another dimension. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5028.733s">But</a>  the high school is probably the most problematic place because there are a lot of activities, there's community schools, there's the use of the pool, there's athletic events, there's concerts, there's meetings, there's all kinds of things, there's daycare, there's all kinds of things going on up there simultaneously. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5045.405s">And</a>  so that's our biggest challenge.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5047.267s">I</a>  mean, I don't think, I mean, I'm not a big fan of wands or any of that stuff, but I mean, I think just, I just think from the point of entry perspective, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5055.635s">That's</a>  a tough, it's a tough building to probably safeguard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5057.841s">I'm</a>  just thinking, you know, as to, you know, maybe some professional advice would be.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5063.245s">Good</a>  way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5064.086s">Superintendent,</a>  and we have had professional advice in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5068.888s">If</a>  you go back a few years, you remember all the cameras that were installed in strategic locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5074.251s">The</a>  plan that said that certain doors would not be used, but there are still those who violate that from inside the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5081.634s">And</a>  sometimes those doors are left open. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5085.196s">I</a>  look at the report, nobody wanted the incident to happen, but as I look at the report, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5090.579s">The</a>  report is put together very well and they're looking at all aspects of how you take a situation that shouldn't happen and how you eliminate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5099.344s">It</a>  was just a couple of years ago that we were all beating our chest because the news media was trying to break into, not break into, but gain entry into school systems around this whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5110.571s">The</a>  only school system they couldn't get into a school was the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5115.534s">We</a>  were all very proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5119.092s">I</a>  know just in the last couple of weeks, I have been at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5121.613s">I</a>  have been at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5122.914s">I</a>  have been at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5124.594s">I</a>  couldn't get into any of them because there is a good system in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5131.117s">Around</a>  the time that this incident happened, if you remember on the news, there was one individual in a different community who had been terminated, but still kept one of the uniform shirts and just walked in with everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5144.623s">There</a>  was another person who did the exact same thing that this person did. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5149.1s">And</a>  maybe this person saw this on the news as to how you do it, but you go to another area and you try and float in with the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5157.242s">Now</a>  it's a situation nobody wanted to happen, but it's a situation that everyone's working to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5164.144s">I</a>  don't care if it's a fire, a break-in or a criminal activity in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5168.646s">The</a>  first report that you hear about what happened in that particular incident is never the factual report. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5176.632s">that</a>  is the same three or four days later. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5179.093s">That's</a>  why an investigation takes some time to look into all aspects of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5183.935s">So</a>  everybody has all of the facts correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5187.016s">As</a>  I'm listening to the administrators talk and the superintendent and everybody else, um, talked about the fact that, you know, we do have protocols in place, but <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5200.608s">This</a>  person could have been a student, maybe not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5205.673s">The</a>  people do need some more training, do need some more direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5209.837s">They</a>  should be signed in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5212.159s">And</a>  then you move forward to make sure that you have a secure school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5218.765s">We</a>  have a secure school system, but we want to make sure that situations like that do not continue to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5227.017s">And</a>  I think if you look at the past records, you will see how well it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5231.02s">We</a>  even had people in here one night from Massport who were talking about a competition between the Americans and the Israelis as to who could penetrate each other's airports quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5243.89s">Because</a>  at that time, we were talking about putting the airport security in as you go in and out of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5249.714s">And</a>  then the wands, and everybody wanted them at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5252.996s">They</a>  said they can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5255.463s">The</a>  same thing will happen to you as it happened to us is when at Logan Airport, they spent $5 million on a new secure system, and the Israelis said, we can penetrate that in less than 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5266.271s">So</a>  you never know when someone's coming on a plane or how they're going to attempt to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5271.374s">But</a>  the person simply walked through the area where they had all of the, what do you call that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5279.9s">Detectors.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5280.821s">Whatever</a>  they call it, detectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5282.435s">They</a>  walked right through, he put down his cup of coffee, went through the detector, nothing went off, picked up the cup of coffee, said, hey, here's a hand grenade, everyone's dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5290.738s">And</a>  he said, the point of telling you that is, even though we go above and beyond trying to make sure that no one can get in those schools without any circumstances, he said, if somebody wants to do something, they don't have to do it in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5305.662s">They</a>  can do something outside the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5308.903s">And</a>  that was the point of it, but we have still, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5311.983s">since</a>  that time, still gone above and beyond to make secure facilities that are up to this point almost impossible to get into. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5322.385s">But</a>  you had, as you said, I don't know if we call it a fluke, but a situation that everybody's working together to make sure it doesn't happen and move forward.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5530.114s">I</a>  understand that- Point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5532.816s">Mr.</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5534.117s">I</a>  believe the person snuck in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5535.999s">They</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5536.479s">The</a>  person looked like a child. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5537.74s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5538.06s">They</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5538.74s">No</a>  one was.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5540.18s">Well,</a>  then there's conflict of stories, because there's also been stories that they have been stopped, and they were asked a question.</p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5548.423s">Once</a>  they got in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5549.604s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5549.924s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5550.224s">So</a>  once they got in the building, they were asked a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5552.885s">If</a>  they didn't know who that person was, you escort them to the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5558.006s">It's</a>  absolutely what everybody said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5559.807s">It's</a>  been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5561.127s">We</a>  can't change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5563.048s">We</a>  thank God that nothing has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5566.425s">I</a>  think we all are responsible for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5568.186s">I</a>  mean, the other thing I'm looking at is the Fox media. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5573.828s">If</a>  we're in a situation that, God forbid, this was about stealing, but let's say it was even higher than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5581.77s">And</a>  we've been told by our police not to have anybody know because they're in the middle of this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5588.113s">I</a>  don't believe in the time frame of it because it did happen on Friday and we didn't find out until Monday or Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5594.437s">But</a>  what I'm trying to say is that if the police are in the middle of this and they are in the middle of an investigation and the media decides to leak it somewhere, isn't that jeopardizing us? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5604.822s">Isn't</a>  there any type of repercussion on them? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5608.514s">I</a>  mean, these are questions I'd like to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5611.437s">As</a>  far as the ideas, I totally agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5614.179s">I</a>  mean, as far as, you know, Mr. Edwards, I know that you said it's difficult and all that, but the thing is that if a student forgets the first day, the second day, the third day, there has to be repercussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5624.488s">If</a>  you're going to be doing something just like anything else, you don't bring your homework, you don't bring your homework into class, if you don't take a test, I mean, that's why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5633.035s">We're</a>  here to teach these kids that <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5636.074s">You</a>  just can't continue doing what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5639.096s">I</a>  mean, I work at a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5640.417s">I</a>  have an ID.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5641.438s">That's</a>  not in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5642.659s">That's</a>  what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5643.299s">It's</a>  not Mr. Edwards' fault.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5644.5s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5645.24s">I'm</a>  not saying it was his fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5646.902s">I'm</a>  just saying, everybody has their opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5649.864s">I</a>  just want to say that I agree with the IDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5656.029s">And</a>  as far as even the high school, a lot of the times I'm up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5660.673s">And</a>  again, you can have all the protocols you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5662.875s">But</a>  if you have certain groups that come in there and decide that they want to leave the door open because it's too hot in a room or because they're going in and out of their car to pick up something to bring it into a different room, I've gone and I've shut the door myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5676.968s">They've</a>  gotten mad at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5678.77s">But</a>  we can have all the protocols we want, but if people don't listen and they don't abide by them, then where does this stand? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5688.161s">Where</a>  is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5689.223s">I</a>  mean, this is what I'm trying to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5690.704s">I</a>  mean, we could have all these laws and protocols, but if people within our own school system, and I'm not saying your school, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5697.372s">because</a>  you have done a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5699.234s">I've</a>  been at the McGlynn, I was a parent at the McGlynn, and there were many times I couldn't even get into the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5704.718s">So</a>  it has nothing to do with the McGlynn, it's just in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5708.381s">We</a>  have 37 doors at the high school, we have multi events that are going on, but at times there are also people that have events in our own school system within that if you ask them to abide by the protocol, <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5723.507s">They</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5724.747s">And</a>  then they'll say, you know, certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5727.629s">So,</a>  I mean, they've been, they've been addressed, but we have to keep on addressing them.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5734.731s">Mr.</a>  Bellson. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5736.432s">So</a>  I'm responsible for the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5741.874s">Tonight,</a>  I've told you what I think happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5744.515s">I've</a>  told you what we plan to do about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5748.676s">You've</a>  given me some additional suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5751.807s">We're</a>  going to meet and we're going to follow up some more. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5754.49s">We've</a>  met with our principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5756.292s">I'm</a>  just going to suggest that this is an ongoing process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5759.716s">You</a>  know, one time, two times, three times, not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5762.158s">It</a>  has to happen all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5763.12s">We</a>  have to constantly refresh ourselves, constantly have the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5767.104s">But</a>  I do ask one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5769.627s">Let's</a>  not create fear and anxiety in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5773.863s">For</a>  the most part, our schools are very safe, a lot safer than a lot of schools around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5778.366s">We</a>  have a lot more in place, and you've supported that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5780.887s">The</a>  city has supported that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5782.949s">There</a>  are some people that would like to make it sound as if our schools are not safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5788.793s">It</a>  doesn't mean there's an excuse for what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5792.395s">But</a>  overall, our schools are very safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5794.936s">It's</a>  important that we send that message out, because we want our young people and our families to come to our schools and not be afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5803.09s">But</a>  we have to continuously work at it, and that's our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5806.172s">And</a>  maybe this is a good wake-up call. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5808.354s">Maybe</a>  this is a way of reinforcing our efforts and moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5813.057s">I</a>  want to address one other thing that I read on a blog recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5817.04s">I</a>  want to make sure that if anyone in the public is listening or anyone is picking this up, you understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5824.626s">When</a>  we withheld some information from the public, we didn't do it because there was an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5834.866s">The</a>  two individuals running for the top seat in the city have nothing to do with the security of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5841.069s">Neither</a>  one of them had an advantage or disadvantage from the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5845.311s">And</a>  people that would like to ascribe those kinds of things to the electoral process are way out of line. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5853.556s">We</a>  did it because we felt it was consistent with best police investigative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5860.159s">I</a>  should have notified the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5861.966s">I</a>  accept that as legitimate criticism of me, and I'll do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5868.431s">But</a>  as far as holding it for some nefarious reason, that's pure BS. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5874.856s">It</a>  has nothing to do with what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5878.899s">We</a>  don't politicize situations in our schools, certainly not ones about the safety and security of our young people, our faculty, and our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5888.346s">And</a>  anyone who tries to do that is going to hear from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5892.608s">Cut,</a>  dry, and simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5894.669s">Can</a>  we improve? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5895.569s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5896.23s">Will</a>  we improve? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5897.01s">We</a>  have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5898.431s">Will</a>  we do everything we possibly can? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5900.651s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5902.592s">But</a>  in no way, shape, or form will I be silent when people try to politicize this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5910.856s">We</a>  need to get everybody behind us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5913.337s">We</a>  need parents, kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5915.687s">faculty,</a>  staff, to understand that it's a shared responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5920.832s">It's</a>  a shared responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5924.435s">And</a>  when we do that, we have the best opportunity to keep our kids safe, to keep our world safe, and to promote education in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5933.664s">So</a>  I appreciate what you're telling me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5936.266s">If</a>  there's improvement to be made, it's mine, and I'll work at it, and we'll go from there.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5942.147s">On</a>  the motion, Mr. Skerry, the report be accepted and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5944.909s">All</a>  those in favor say aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5945.95s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5946.11s">Opposed,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5946.57s">The</a>  AICF report is accepted and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5949.112s">The</a>  motion is now adjourned.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5951.053s">Old</a>  business? <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5954.055s">Just</a>  a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5956.917s">I've</a>  requested the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5958.599s">I</a>  forgot to put it on the agenda, but I've requested the community schools budget, and I've also requested <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5967.965s">The</a>  budget of the fields, the rentals, and the income, as well as all school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5974.099s">I</a>  think this is the third request.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5976.364s">Okay,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=5977.005s">This</a>  is the third request and I hope to see it next committee meeting.</p>
