1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,163
Give me an honor, please rise, join us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

2
00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:17,876
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

3
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:19,598
Secretary will call the roll.

00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,935

00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,878

00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:41,702
Opposed, none.

12
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:42,242
The ayes have it.

13
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:42,902
The minutes are approved.

14
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:46,265

Yes.

18
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,748

00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:51,828

23
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,010
Yes.

24
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:54,690
Skerry.

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:54,850
Yes.

26
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,322

27
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:02,963

Yes.

33
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:10,367
Mr. Benedetto.

34
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:10,767
Yes.

35
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:11,567
Mr. Falco.

36
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:11,847
Yes.

37
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:13,068
Mr. Scarpelli.

38
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:13,388
Yes.

39
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:14,429
Mr. Scari.

40
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:14,709
Yes.

41
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:15,549
Mrs. Van de Kloop.

42
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:15,889
Yes.

43
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:16,970
Mayor McGlynn.

44
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,430
Yes.

45
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,011
By vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

46
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:19,911
The payrolls are approved.

47
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:21,312
Report of the secretary, none.

48
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,312
Report of committees, none.

49
00:01:22,953 --> 00:01:24,033
Committee participation, none.

50
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:25,814
Report of the superintendent.

51
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:37,245
Before we do that, the members of the school committee have invited a school committee woman, elect Cathy Kretz to sit with us behind the rail.

52
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,846
We welcome her in this evening.

53
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:40,407
Mr. Superintendent.

54
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:47,792
I think we can participate in some of the agenda, but Melanie will turn off when I would like to address the special education.

55
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:52,755
On a motion of Mr. Van Duke that the rules be suspended, all in favor say aye.

56
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:53,315
Aye.

57
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:54,416
Rules are suspended.

58
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:55,357
Melanie?

59
00:01:58,978 --> 00:01:59,358
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:06,003
I, on the agenda, there was nothing on the committee community participation, but yes, I'm sorry.

61
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:08,685
I didn't actually ask ahead of time.

62
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:10,146
I just prompted me.

63
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:11,026
I just came tonight.

64
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:11,707
So thank you.

65
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,468
I appreciate you suspending the rules for a moment.

66
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:18,272
I just wanted to invite the school committee next month, especially in light of the elections.

67
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:24,236
We wanted to invite the school committee to the Medford special education parent advisory council meeting next month on December 9th.

68
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,294
It's from seven to nine at the Andrews Middle School.

69
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:36,019
I'm sure you won't, we wouldn't expect you to stay the whole time, but we'd love to have coffee and pastries and just host the school committee members and particularly the new school committee members as well.

70
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:39,661
And just a way to say hello and keep the conversation going.

71
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:40,621
That's pretty much it.

72
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:47,706
And also this Wednesday, we have basic rights in special education at the Andrews Middle School from seven to nine.

73
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:54,650
So it's a great opportunity for folks, especially general educators, frankly, to learn a lot about special education and basic rights.

74
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,686
That's it.

75
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:58,167
Thank you.

76
00:02:59,127 --> 00:02:59,788
Thank you.

77
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:07,873
I just want to address, I want to say thank you, but I also want to let you know that I would love to be there, but I have to be at a state meeting at the same night in Marlborough.

78
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:10,675
So please keep me advised.

79
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:24,980
Mr. Superintendent.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,292
Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, I want to get this to you very quickly because obviously we have to make some phone calls.

81
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:39,457
And I want to make sure that we're all in agreement as to what's going to take place.

82
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:48,620
As you know, we approved a trip to Washington, DC, which was going to go there Thursday morning with about 35 students and faculty members and other people.

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,285
We have checked with the insurance company and the like, and we are planning to cancel that trip in light of recent events at this point in time.

84
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:02,708
It's unfortunate, but there's all kinds of safety and security issues that are associated with that.

85
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:05,370
It's covered by insurance at least to 75% of the cost.

86
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,003
We may get 100% of the cost back.

87
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:17,206
If we don't, we'll talk about how we might be able to help the students and others recapture the remaining part, or reschedule it at a later date.

88
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:21,128
But at this particular point in time, we can't get enough assurances of safety.

89
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:29,092
The youngsters would be in situations where they were out in the open, in public places, traveling into monuments and other things of that type.

90
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:40,013
It's just a bad time for people who are traveling, given the current news that's been out there and some statements made by terrorist groups around the world.

91
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:45,395
So unless there's an objection, I'm going to go ahead and cancel that immediately.

92
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:47,996
Chair, do you have any objection?

93
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:48,296
Mr. Mayor.

94
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:50,577
I move that we cancel the trip until further notice.

95
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:52,978
On the motion, all in favor say aye.

96
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:53,258
Aye.

97
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:59,319
I just, you know, I know some of the kids going on that trip and they're looking so forward to it.

98
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:01,701
Has there been any discussion with them yet?

99
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:06,307
Was there any discussion today?

100
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:12,354
Well, you know, with the high school, there's been a discussion with different people, but Bernadette's been in the middle of it.

101
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,596
Can you probably come up, Bernadette, and talk a little bit about that?

102
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,065
Good evening.

103
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:29,170
So no formal, obviously, notification went out because we wanted to wait for the superintendent to make that decision.

104
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:34,794
There were several students who did approach the chaperones at different times during the day with some concern.

105
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:42,298
There were at least two parents by late afternoon who had contacted members of the administration about concern.

106
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,002
So no, the students do not know, but perhaps they know now if their parents are watching.

107
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:56,791
So we're very sorry, and we know that this is going to be a wonderful opportunity to learn about civic education.

108
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:04,360
So just moments ago, two of the chaperones are here, Nalita Lopori and Nicole Chalifoux, and they're very disappointed.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,567
We talked about perhaps some other opportunities that we could create for them here in Medford.

110
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:17,514
So, we know that they're disappointed.

111
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:19,776
The chaperones are disappointed.

112
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:24,741
Taryn Ross and Michael Skorger did an immense amount of work putting this together.

113
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:26,303
They're very disappointed.

114
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:30,007
But, we all understand that security is important.

115
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:33,208
is the first and foremost concern.

116
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:40,234
So we certainly do accept, we accept this decision and we will move forward in a productive way.

117
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:49,002
And if I could ask specifically, I wonder if there's been any conversation with the group that's hosting the event and whether there's any chance they might put it off.

118
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,907
Since the other school's systems must have our same concerns.

119
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:03,435
Okay, so as of this afternoon, we learned that Brookline, who is leaving tomorrow, is still moving forward with their trip.

120
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:07,677
They were outside of the 48 hours or within the 48 hours.

121
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:18,784
They did not have the same option that we have of canceling two days in advance and getting that 75% back, so I'm not sure if that's what went into their decision.

122
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:24,307
The travel company was very receptive to our concerns today.

123
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:26,788
I talked to them along with Michael Skorger and Taryn Ross.

124
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,630
They were very understanding, very helpful.

125
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,932
There was no hesitation on their part.

126
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:35,533
They just wanted to contact the insurance company.

127
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:41,599
So as the superintendent said, right now, they are canceling for any reason.

128
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,963
That category, they get 75% back.

129
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:50,708
There's a possibility parents could be reimbursed 100%.

130
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:52,830
We're working on that, but it will be at least 75%.

131
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,050
OK.

132
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,672
Thank you.

133
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:56,454
It's nice to hear a little bit more.

134
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,255
It's very, very disappointing for the students.

135
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:00,711
Mister Scudero.

136
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:06,636
Bernadette, do we know how much the 25% we're talking about, how much money we're talking?

137
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:09,898
Actually, I don't know if Nicole or Nelida have the exact price.

138
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:11,099
My understanding was it was about $550.

139
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:11,960
Is that correct?

140
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,200
It's about $550.

141
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,922
So about 75% of that would be, what, $420 or so.

142
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:15,042
Oh, OK.

143
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:15,622
So whatever 75% of the $550 is.

144
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:16,463
So it's about $100.

145
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:41,146
I know we just, I just wanted to ask, is there any way of discussing a future, like further down, like maybe, hopefully, maybe in the middle of the year or at the end of the year?

146
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:51,434
So the travel company's advice was to just cancel, instead of postponing, because we originally thought we'd postpone, their advice was to cancel out, right?

147
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:53,255
That way the students can get the money back.

148
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:56,918
And then in the future, if we want, we can talk about rebooking.

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,983
Mr. Mayor, just one other point I think that everyone needs to know.

150
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:13,050
Obviously, we don't like to do these things, but we may be able to schedule some Skyping with the Congress people and other people that they would otherwise have talked to in person.

151
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:23,397
And so we'll look at that tomorrow morning, see if we can't create another experience that would be at least a good experience for them to carry out that kind of work.

152
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:28,362
And now that we've discussed it here, I mean, are parents going to be notified via mail, via telephone?

153
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:31,764
We need to discuss that.

154
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:39,130
In fact, I was just on the phone with Michael Skorka outside just before the meeting began, and that was his question, is how do we convey this to parents?

155
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:45,315
So to the parents who are listening, you know that the trip is canceled and that you are entitled to at least 75% off.

156
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:49,096
All students had the insurance, which was a great thing.

157
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:55,698
How we officially communicate that beyond tonight, we will determine tomorrow morning.

158
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:58,219
How many students were we talking about?

159
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,460
About 32, 35.

160
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:10,954
36.

161
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:10,954
Well, I would hope that it would be a little bit more personal than just listening to it over in a meeting.

162
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:20,001
So I know it's hard because of time wise, but I would really appreciate that if something else could be done rather than just, I mean, there's two chaperones, right?

163
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:20,761
Two chaperones.

164
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:21,362
Four.

165
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:22,102
Four.

166
00:10:22,343 --> 00:10:26,566
So maybe the list could be divided up and just a personal phone call real quick to those parents.

167
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:28,948
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

168
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:36,575
Safety is my first concern for our students and taking care of them, but I'm just curious Do you know of any other systems that are backing up?

169
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:38,058
Are we the first?

170
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:38,959
Are we the only?

171
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,059
I'm just curious.

172
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:49,224
So when I talked to Go Travel, the company who organized it today, they said that they were fully expecting to hear from Medford today.

173
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:51,465
They didn't mention any other school system.

174
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:58,729
We learned that Brookline, I don't know how many schools were going down this week.

175
00:10:59,029 --> 00:10:59,909
I know Brookline was.

176
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,091
And like I just said, Brookline is moving forward.

177
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:06,193
Other school systems, I'm not aware of.

178
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:14,267
Do you think that there will be another opportunity for a similar thing to happen for this group of students in this school year?

179
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:17,967
I'm not sure how many seniors were on board.

180
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:20,868
I'm not sure about the likelihood of this school year.

181
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:29,170
I would like to think that things are going to calm down and that our students will have an opportunity to travel to

182
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,021
to Washington, D.C.

183
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:35,844
As you know, it's a wonderful city, great things to learn about our capital.

184
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:42,307
So I am hoping that they will have that opportunity again, if not this year, then perhaps in the next school year.

185
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,369
I mean, obviously, this is a heightened period of concern.

186
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,111
It's right after a significant event.

187
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:52,954
And, you know, we have to be measured in how we approach these things.

188
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:58,117
It may be that in a few weeks, things would change and other things are possible going forward in the next few months.

189
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:04,284
Right now, not enough is known about what could be happening internationally.

190
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:11,926
We need to give people an opportunity to tell us before we start putting any situations in place that could compromise the safety of the students.

191
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:15,126
Thank you.

192
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:16,347
Thank you.

193
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:18,767
On the motion, all in favor say aye.

194
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:19,147
Aye.

195
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:21,388
The motion is approved.

196
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,388
The trip is canceled.

197
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:27,025
Report of the MIAA Sportsmanship Award, Mr. Superintendent.

198
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:43,434
Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, I'm going to call up Rachel Perry, our assistant athletic director, to come up here and deliver this report and also to recognize some students along with Mr. Dempsey and others and to present an award to some of the people who are recipients.

199
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:56,910
Good evening.

200
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:03,913
I'd like to recognize Jack Dempsey, Gigi Braga, Victoria Rashi, and Katrina Rashi.

201
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:20,301
They put in a multimedia sportsmanship video that showed what they were doing and what with the Crystal Campbell softball tournament and the things that they were doing to raise money for the Crystal Campbell scholarship.

202
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,382
They won first place from the MIAA.

203
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:26,235
And they got a $400 scholarship.

204
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:31,559
And they will be recognized on this Friday at Gillette Stadium.

205
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,262
There's a big summit that they'll be presenting at Gillette Stadium.

206
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:36,743
They'll be showing their video.

207
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,445
And they'll be presenting them with a check and an award.

208
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,467
So they did a tremendous job.

209
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:46,150
Back in the spring, I saw this opportunity for the athletic department.

210
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,591
And I contacted Jack.

211
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:48,692
I knew he was the guy that would

212
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:53,661
put this together, and he contacted students and they put the video together.

213
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:57,084
I don't know if any of you have seen it, but it's a tremendous video.

214
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,045
They did a great job.

215
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:03,890
So I'd like to call Jack and Gigi, Katrina, and Victoria up.

216
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:04,711
Rachel?

217
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,574
If we wanted to see the video, is it online?

218
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:08,234
It is.

219
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,196
It's actually right on the Medford website.

220
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:10,676
Okay, perfect.

221
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:12,098
Yeah, it's right on that front page.

222
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:17,898
I had the opportunity to see the video.

223
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:25,985
I went on the web page and I noticed it and I clicked on it and I just have to say I was so proud of these students when I saw the video.

224
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:31,630
Tears came to my eyes and I was really, really felt very proud of our students winning this award.

225
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,931
So thank you very, very much.

226
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:37,474
Victoria Rasha.

227
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:50,188
Katrina Rashi.

228
00:14:58,873 --> 00:14:59,874
Gigi Braga.

229
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:09,919
And Mr. Dempsey, you want to say a couple of words?

230
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:18,879
All I can say is these kids make me look really good.

231
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,442
That's all I can say.

232
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:27,928
Thank you very much.

233
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:35,235
We all want to congratulate all the students for the fine job that they have done.

234
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,318
And especially these

235
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:46,298
Three young ladies that we've had an opportunity to work with in many different aspects of community life in the Medfit High Educational Experience.

236
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:49,460
And they are always standouts in everything they do.

237
00:15:50,160 --> 00:16:00,707
And I had the opportunity to look at the video with Gigi and Mr. Dempsey, and they really did a great job.

238
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:07,152
And when you think of all the content that goes into it and what they have done,

239
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:13,241
And all the money that they have raised for scholarships to provide opportunities for other students.

240
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:19,604
You should be very proud of what the three young ladies have accomplished and we all congratulate you.

241
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:37,013
I'm going to ask if everybody would please rise for a moment of silence in memory of and out of respect to those who lost their lives.

242
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,122
and those who survived them in Paris over the weekend.

243
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,851
On that report, the motion has been approved that the report be accepted and placed on file.

244
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,132
On that motion, all in favor say aye.

245
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:12,432
Opposed, no.

246
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:12,952
The ayes have it.

247
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,653
The report is accepted and placed on file.

248
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:18,035
Report on foreign language scholarship award.

249
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:19,615
Mr. Superintendent.

250
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:29,820
Mr. Mayor, I'm going to call up Director of Curriculum to comment on this award and to allow the recipient to come forward and

251
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:32,914
Good evening.

252
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:40,459
Actually, I'm going to ask foreign language teacher Nicole Chalafo to deliver the report.

253
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:44,542
She is here tonight, and she actually attended the event with the student.

254
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:48,304
So Nicole, if you would like to deliver the report.

255
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:49,425
Thank you.

256
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,846
Good evening.

257
00:17:52,267 --> 00:18:01,373
Rachel Garland, a Medford High School senior AP Italian student, recently received a $1,000 scholarship from the Federazione Associazione Abruzzese

258
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:06,220
USA for her excellence in the study of Italian.

259
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:17,026
The scholarship was awarded to Rachel on the evening of October 10th at the FAA USA annual gala celebration, which took place at Filippo's restaurant in the north end of Boston.

260
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:23,490
Rachel was accompanied to this event by her mother and three Italian teachers from Medford High School, myself,

261
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:24,115
Ms.

262
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:25,696
Monica Canetta, and Ms.

263
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:26,637
Bianca Hoffman.

264
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:32,540
Another high school senior from Revere High School was awarded the second of the two scholarships given that evening.

265
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:44,567
In order to qualify for the scholarship, Rachel had to submit an essay on the impact that studying Italian has had on her life, and that evening she delivered her speech all in Italian.

266
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:50,350
Present at the celebration were over 150 members of the Federation, many from out of state.

267
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:57,557
Also present was the Consul General of Italy, Dr. Nicola De Santis, who conversed with Rachel in Italian.

268
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:07,488
This year's celebration was particularly special because guests included members of the Associazione Giostra Cavaleresca di Sulmona, right from Italy.

269
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:14,435
This is a folkloric group, and that evening they impressed all in attendance with their rich Renaissance garments and noble appearances.

270
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:24,809
The medieval giostra, or jousting costumes, accompanied by trumpet and drum players with flag-throwing performances provided an exciting and authentic setback in time.

271
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,432
Rachel felt very honored, and all of us are very proud of this Medford High School senior.

272
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:33,334
Unfortunately, Rachel was not able to attend this evening.

273
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:36,455
She is at work, but we are very proud of her.

274
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:37,716
She's a wonderful, wonderful girl.

275
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:39,277
Thank you.

276
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:40,678
Thank you very much.

277
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:45,180
And we all send our best wishes to Rachel and congratulate her for the great job that

278
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,673
that she's done.

279
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:51,497
And the new Consul General, Nicolo DeSantis, is quite a guy.

280
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:56,002
He spends a lot of time either with our students or here in the city of Medford.

281
00:19:56,022 --> 00:20:00,045
He was just here helping cut the ribbon for the new restaurant in the square.

282
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,547
I saw that, yes.

283
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:09,835
In fact, Rachel, when she had prepared her speech and the time of the dinner was a little bit thrown off, and so at first she didn't get a full

284
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:13,232
for the whole audience that was there.

285
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:16,714
And the consul called her back over to our table where he was seated with us.

286
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:18,054
And it was one-on-one.

287
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:19,135
They had a great conversation.

288
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,596
So we really made sure that she got that attention, too.

289
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:23,237
Mr. Mayor?

290
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:23,917
Ms.

291
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:24,237
Vertu.

292
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:28,159
I would also like to thank the three teachers who went along for the presentation.

293
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,860
Our pleasure.

294
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,140
And Ms.

295
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:32,841
Canetta and Ms.

296
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,742
Hoffman are both new to Medford this year, as well.

297
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:35,423
Thank you.

298
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:35,923
So that's great.

299
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:37,283
Thank you.

300
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:37,764
Thank you.

301
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:38,064
Thank you.

302
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,448
On the motion, Mr. Falco, if the report is accepted and placed on file.

303
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:43,208
All those in favor say aye.

304
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:43,668
Opposed, no.

305
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,368
The ayes have it.

306
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:45,928
The report is accepted and placed on file.

307
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:51,550
Recommendation to approve trip to Puerto Rico, Mr. Superintendent.

308
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,631
I'm going to call up again, Nelida Lepore, who is leading the trip.

309
00:20:58,491 --> 00:20:59,692
We just talked about trips.

310
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:02,732
As you know, the nation's capital has been tapped.

311
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:04,473
So this is a little bit different.

312
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:05,493
It's a little further away.

313
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,574
So I think we're in a pretty good place to look at this this evening.

314
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:11,054
So I'll turn it over to Nelida.

315
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,895
Buenas noches.

316
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:17,137
Yes, we're planning, and also we're planning the trip in April.

317
00:21:17,597 --> 00:21:22,999
So hopefully by then we will have a better idea of the situation, what's going on.

318
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,082
But I am planning a trip for the April vacation with the students.

319
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:31,163
We usually leave on the Thursday evening before.

320
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:40,605
And that's done to save some costs, because there's a $45 charge to leave on Friday, Saturday from Logan Airport.

321
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,726
I think that's most airports they do.

322
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:45,147
So just to save some money for the students.

323
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:47,749
And then we come back seven days later.

324
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:50,130
But we're taking the Pelicano tour.

325
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:56,233
And so based on the number of students that we will take, hopefully I'm trying to get 20, 21.

326
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:57,254
The cost of the trip will be $2,165.

327
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:05,162
which will include everything that they will be doing on the trip.

328
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:15,666
The interesting thing about Puerto Rico is that if you've been to Costa Rica and you've been to Spain, Puerto Rico is a combination of the two.

329
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:22,588
It has a strong cultural colonial experience, but then along it has the science component to it.

330
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:29,871
So one of the things that we will be doing is going to the Bioluminescent Bay, which I've taken the students before to other times.

331
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:33,423
There are only six in the world, and Puerto Rico has two.

332
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:37,166
So they're able to experience things like this, the rainforest.

333
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:39,208
But then we have dance lessons.

334
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:49,135
We do some salsa, and this year I've included another type of dance that's typical of the island, which is the bomba, which shows our African heritage.

335
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:56,636
And we've included a cooking class, and we've also included a community service component.

336
00:22:56,676 --> 00:23:00,598
We will be visiting a school, and the students will be getting community service hours.

337
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:03,319
So it's a little bit different, this trip.

338
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:08,882
I try to tweak each trip to customize it to fit today's educational needs.

339
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:15,245
The trip includes the air flight, all the hotels, two meals a day.

340
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:21,619
and entrances to all the exhibits and things that we'll be doing, like the zip lining and things like that.

341
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,140
So hopefully it'll be a go.

342
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,580
So far, five students have already registered.

343
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,981
And they all understand that it was with the approval of the school committee.

344
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:33,581
Mr. Mayer?

345
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:33,941
Mr. Mayer.

346
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:35,081
Sounds like a great trip.

347
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:39,162
By the way, I have a lot of free time in April, if you need anything.

348
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:40,502
You're welcome to join us.

349
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:40,682
Yeah.

350
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:42,143
Happy zip lining with everybody.

351
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:42,523
Mrs. Spunio.

352
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,326
I think it's a great opportunity.

353
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:56,091
My concern is, unfortunately, because of things that are happening more so than ever, is there going to be insurance involved with this price?

354
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:56,391
Yes.

355
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:59,593
We always encourage the students to take out insurance.

356
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:07,197
And in light of what's just happened, we're going to demand it if they want to go on the trip just to protect ourselves.

357
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:13,536
Okay, when you say that you advise if they get it, is that something that's separate or is that something?

358
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:14,777
Yes, it's separate costs.

359
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:15,617
Okay.

360
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:16,178
Yeah.

361
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:26,446
Could we just look into that though because I just want to make sure that when we do these types of trips for our students, I think it's very beneficiary that we include.

362
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:31,790
I know it costs a little bit more money, but it's very beneficial for us to make sure that we have

363
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:47,939
that insurance, because I believe that insurance not only covers the cancellation of the trip, but it also incurs if by any chance, God forbid, there's any type of sickness or someone gets hurt or someone, and I think it's very beneficial that it is part of the package deal.

364
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:57,347
I have been traveling with the students since 1999, and that has always been a priority that I've mentioned to the students, because we always book the trip

365
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:05,599
well in advance, and I always say you never know what will happen from here to there at that time, so that it really is crucial to do that.

366
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:07,560
I mean, it's their choice.

367
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,441
It's a gamble they take.

368
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:11,381
It usually comes out about $250, $260 extra to do it.

369
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:21,970
Just a point of information, there are other opportunities out there.

370
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,791
I know because I've looked them up that they're not as high as that.

371
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:27,271
So it has to be researched a little bit more.

372
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:40,055
I'm not saying you, but I am saying that that is something, especially where these students are going and where the ones that are responsible for them, I really believe that that has to be part of the trip.

373
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:57,371
So I read your itinerary and I love that you included the community service aspect in between the Salsa dancing.

374
00:25:58,471 --> 00:26:07,737
I thought it was a really good balance and I love that you put the educational piece in with all the fun and giving back to other communities.

375
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:07,977
So,

376
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:11,680
I was very impressed with it, and I just wanted to make that comment to you.

377
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,743
I've traveled with four or five companies through the years, and this is the one company I have been the most impressed with.

378
00:26:18,464 --> 00:26:21,925
The first time I went to Puerto Rico, I took 38 students.

379
00:26:22,786 --> 00:26:28,049
There were two chaperones from the company with us in addition to the chaperones that I had.

380
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:33,812
We also had a car following us at all times in case of an emergency.

381
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,689
And Puerto Rico is like being here in the United States.

382
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,311
CVS, Walgreens, everything is everywhere.

383
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:43,073
So we did have to tap that.

384
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:48,036
One student forgot her medication, so we were able to get medication for her.

385
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:52,459
Another interesting thing was I had to take a student to the dentist.

386
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,981
And I know you can appreciate that.

387
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:59,945
And I said, I never thought I'd be traveling with students going to a dentist.

388
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:02,453
I just never know.

389
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:05,554
I really love that service piece.

390
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:10,156
I think the kids will come home with more than just trinkets.

391
00:27:10,256 --> 00:27:15,617
They'll come home with more self-esteem in the fact that they gave back to a community.

392
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:23,039
Kids at my school go to Guatemala every year for three weeks and they work in a school and they come back different people.

393
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:29,921
It opens up their eyes and I know a lot of my students have all done the semester abroad or the year abroad.

394
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:38,237
And they've always said that these trips that we offer at Medford High have really given them that taste, that sense of confidence to do that.

395
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:39,979
It's great.

396
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,780
Thank you for offering it to our children.

397
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,880
Well, I love it.

398
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:45,802
I really enjoy seeing it through their eyes.

399
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:50,806
On the motion, all those in favor, say aye.

400
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:51,066
Aye.

401
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:51,686
Aye.

402
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:52,107
Thank you.

403
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:53,448
Thank you.

404
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:55,329
Have a great time.

405
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:56,450
OK, thank you.

406
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:56,870
Thank you.

407
00:28:12,914 --> 00:28:16,795
Report on the Metro Vocational School open house, Mr. Superintendent.

408
00:28:16,815 --> 00:28:23,897
Mr. Chair and members of the committee, most of you attended the open house of the vocational school, so it speaks for itself.

409
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:30,440
I think it was an outstanding presentation by the vocational school faculty, the director, all the staff up there.

410
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,081
The new health assisting program was outstanding.

411
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:40,008
revamp of the facilities and other matters really stood out.

412
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:41,810
Vocational school is definitely on the move.

413
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,192
Our director, Heidi Rich here, would have been here this evening.

414
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:46,854
Unfortunately, her mother passed away.

415
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:51,477
I have a notice in front of you.

416
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:54,400
Her name is Elaine Donahue.

417
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,443
Arrangements are Wednesday night and Thursday up in Lawrence.

418
00:29:00,588 --> 00:29:05,732
So I'm not going to go into that report tonight except to say that if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

419
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:12,417
Otherwise, we'll save it for another time when Heidi can be with us and talk to you more completely about our vocational initiatives.

420
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:15,477
Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry.

421
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:19,959
I just want to say, first of all, our condolences to Heidi and to her family.

422
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:30,366
But also, I got a lot of feedback that night from people that had come up and toured the vocational school, and they were very, very impressed.

423
00:29:30,406 --> 00:29:40,092
A lot of parents that have students in eighth grade that came up to the open house, they were really impressed on how things have changed and the opportunities that the students are having.

424
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:43,164
So I just want to take the time out to say thank you to Ms.

425
00:29:43,204 --> 00:29:50,809
Riccio, to our staff, and to the school, because it has changed quite a bit in a very short time.

426
00:29:53,031 --> 00:29:53,571
Mr. Mayor.

427
00:29:54,132 --> 00:29:55,212
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

428
00:29:56,613 --> 00:30:00,556
So I just want to say how great the facility looked.

429
00:30:01,077 --> 00:30:02,157
I mean, it was clean.

430
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:04,019
They're redoing bathrooms.

431
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,180
The shops look great.

432
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,642
The kids are all invested.

433
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:09,483
They all wear.

434
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:13,258
the clothing from the vocational school.

435
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:20,661
You can see the pride in their school, their enthusiasm to be there, how comfortable they are within that area of the building.

436
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:23,482
It's just wonderful to see.

437
00:30:23,842 --> 00:30:30,104
Not to mention that in the paint shop that night was a car that I donated and they're painting and they're putting the Mustang logo on it.

438
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:30,924
It was a 99 Durango.

439
00:30:32,952 --> 00:30:35,134
And I think that the administration's going to use it.

440
00:30:35,494 --> 00:30:36,215
It runs great.

441
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:37,816
But it was so fun.

442
00:30:37,856 --> 00:30:40,838
The kid went in to start painting it while I was there.

443
00:30:40,878 --> 00:30:43,640
And he's all in the protective wear.

444
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:45,662
It just brought me joy.

445
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:50,846
So if anyone in the community really has a nice car that they want to donate, the Volk is always doing it.

446
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:55,830
Because they worked in the mechanic shop, the auto body shop.

447
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:03,358
And like so many different kids have had their hands on it, it was just really great to see a project go through the whole thing.

448
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:12,828
And the pride in the students and the cleanliness of the building and how far it's come in the last five years.

449
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:16,512
And it's been to the superintendent, yourself.

450
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,799
And this committee investing in the children of MedFed and the programs that we offer.

451
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:22,559
And Ms.

452
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:25,360
Riccio is a breath of fresh air.

453
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,840
But it always built.

454
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,420
It was always a good school.

455
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,601
The traditional shops are still there.

456
00:31:30,861 --> 00:31:32,921
And we offer great education for students.

457
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:34,702
It's a pride and a gem.

458
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:38,062
And I think I said this years ago, it was a gem.

459
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,463
In the community, it just needs a little polish.

460
00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:41,923
Well, it's pretty polished.

461
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:43,064
It looks really nice.

462
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:45,304
And we all should be proud of all the work that we've done.

463
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:49,770
In addition to that, we also want to thank Lowe's.

464
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,611
We made a $25,000 donation to help a lot of this happen.

465
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:56,713
And also the furniture.

466
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:57,593
Oh, Vertex.

467
00:31:57,893 --> 00:31:59,394
Pharmaceuticals.

468
00:31:59,694 --> 00:32:00,374
And the alumni.

469
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:03,116
A lot of alumni have been really stepping up.

470
00:32:03,156 --> 00:32:04,576
Just a whole group of people.

471
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:07,558
It's actually listed in here, all the different groups that.

472
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:08,578
And the furniture.

473
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:10,499
Furniture from the Furniture Trust.

474
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,480
The Furniture Trust.

475
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,340
A lot of free furniture.

476
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,901
And the director of that.

477
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:38,812
of the vocational school, there were pictures of her with the sledgehammer, and her husband was there, and they were laying the tile floors, and they were like hands on, knee deep, and it was just like a whole board across the thing, and to see the progression of how that shop changed, it's just really everybody up there giving their all.

478
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:48,934
It's a great community atmosphere and it's very impressive and I'm very proud of what Meffitt has done in that over the last few years.

479
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:53,175
It just shows that we can do anything and everything when we work together.

480
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:53,936
Mr. Mayor.

481
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:54,896
Mr. Fellow.

482
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,176
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

483
00:32:56,276 --> 00:32:58,557
I actually had the opportunity to attend the open house as well.

484
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:01,495
not only as a school committee member, but also as a parent.

485
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:05,318
Uh, my son's in eighth grade and he's in that process of making the decision now.

486
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:14,084
And, uh, as we walked through the halls and, you know, he bumped into his friends and his, you know, his friends, parents, I mean, just, it's amazing.

487
00:33:14,104 --> 00:33:21,310
I mean, the people, the amount of people that are saying, you know what, we think we're going to the vocational school and it just shows how long, how far the school has come.

488
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:25,333
The programs, I mean, you go from shop to shop, the passion,

489
00:33:25,895 --> 00:33:28,117
from the children, or I should say from the students.

490
00:33:28,697 --> 00:33:30,599
They're very passionate about what they're learning.

491
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:36,283
The instructors, I mean, they're all deeply involved in what's going on.

492
00:33:36,323 --> 00:33:38,765
And it's just, they're doing a great job.

493
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:43,168
I mean, Heidi and her staff are doing a remarkable job.

494
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:47,872
The health assistance program, it just came out phenomenal.

495
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:48,712
It looks really nice.

496
00:33:48,732 --> 00:33:49,813
They did a great job.

497
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:53,136
And the open house in general was just a huge success.

498
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:55,269
And I think you can tell by the enrollment numbers.

499
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:58,410
You look at the freshman class this year, it's higher.

500
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,070
It's probably the highest it's been in years.

501
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,351
So great job by the folk.

502
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:07,253
And actually, not to take away from the folk, but I went to the Medford High School, but I was back a few weeks ago.

503
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:08,513
And that was great too.

504
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:11,074
And it was great to walk through and meet the teachers as well.

505
00:34:11,575 --> 00:34:13,235
And they did a nice job as well.

506
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:16,136
But I just wanted to say great job to the vocational school and the high school.

507
00:34:16,977 --> 00:34:17,357
Thank you.

508
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:17,997
Mr. Mayor.

509
00:34:20,147 --> 00:34:36,234
I noticed that in the report that we got and it said under false state leadership skills USA we were seeking approval to attend this overnight leadership experience for six students and one advisor and that's on November 23rd through November 25th.

510
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:48,260
So in the report it says that they are seeking they want the school committee approval for attendance at the skills USA fall leadership conference which is coming up.

511
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:50,794
When we get the details, we'll bring that to you by the next meeting.

512
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:51,214
No, no.

513
00:34:51,494 --> 00:34:53,036
The, um, we have to vote on it.

514
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:56,219
Uh, it's a weekend of November 23rd.

515
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:57,019
Yeah.

516
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:05,387
So I think we need to take a, I don't think that's really, uh, I'm sure with the, uh, I'm sure with what the death of Ms.

517
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:08,149
Riccio's, uh, mother, this may be.

518
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:14,355
So maybe just to be on the safe side, if we, we, I don't think there's any controversy in it at all.

519
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,008
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor.

520
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:18,368
Where's this report?

521
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:20,328
Because we can't find it over here.

522
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:28,411
So if you look in our folder, on the left-hand side, it said Medford Vocational Technical High School, the school committee report.

523
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:31,231
And I'm referring to the first paragraph.

524
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:32,152
Yeah, Marie.

525
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:41,314
So in the first paragraph, it says we are seeking approval to attend this overnight leadership experience.

526
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:43,955
Motion to approve.

527
00:35:45,261 --> 00:35:45,621
Second.

528
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:48,424
On the motion, all in favor say aye.

529
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:48,825
Aye.

530
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:50,086
The motion is approved.

531
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:54,450
On the motion of Mr. Scott Kelly that the report be accepted and placed on file.

532
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,793
All in favor say aye.

533
00:35:58,714 --> 00:35:58,794
Aye.

534
00:35:58,814 --> 00:36:03,399
The members of the committee would also like to congratulate two of our members.

535
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:09,444
Mr. Falco and Mr. Scott Pelley on their recent election to the Memphis City Council.

536
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:10,465
Thank you.

537
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:14,666
Whether you know it or not, you've already been dubbed as the protectors of education.

538
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:18,068
As we put our budgets together.

539
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:21,269
I'm already planning to ask them for money for the locations.

540
00:36:22,428 --> 00:36:23,209
I already did.

541
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,991
It's going to be much easier at budget time, is that what you're saying?

542
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:30,833
Don't worry about it.

543
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:38,517
It's a great opportunity that members from the school committee are now going to serve on the city council.

544
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:44,221
And I think it broadens the whole debate on a lot of council issues dealing with educational issues.

545
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:44,921
Thank you.

546
00:36:44,961 --> 00:36:45,481
So good luck.

547
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:46,362
Thank you very much.

548
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:49,244
While we're under suspension, all business, there is none.

549
00:36:49,884 --> 00:36:50,985
Communications, none.

550
00:36:51,865 --> 00:37:00,791
New business, school committee resolution being resolved, the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Dr. Daniel Casullo.

551
00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:10,298
Dr. Casullo is a highly regarded dentist, was a graduate of Medford High School and former captain of the varsity basketball team.

552
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:17,663
Resolution submitted by the Medford School Committee to express a sincere condolences to the family of Mrs. Horrigan.

553
00:37:18,284 --> 00:37:20,205

00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,853
Medford Police Chief Leo Sacco, Jr.

555
00:37:23,514 --> 00:37:30,117
Be resolved that Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Alfred Palladino, Jr.

556
00:37:30,597 --> 00:37:34,540
Mr. Palladino was the father-in-law of school committee member, John Falco.

557
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,703
Be resolved that Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Ann Marie Sanford.

558
00:37:41,143 --> 00:37:46,446
Mrs. Sanford was the mother of Medford school teachers Laurie Ann and Nicole Sanford.

559
00:37:47,612 --> 00:37:52,975
Be it resolved the Memphis School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Barbara Steele Cassidy.

560
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:58,317
Barbara was a Memphis School special education supervisor and a long time teacher.

561
00:37:58,857 --> 00:38:04,060
She was an outstanding professional who was well respected by her peers and was a caring friend to many.

562
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,343
Be it resolved the Memphis School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Elaine M. Donahue.

563
00:38:10,743 --> 00:38:14,345
Mrs. Donahue was the mother of vocational director Heidi Riccio.

564
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:21,560
Be resolved, the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Michael Gieselman.

565
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:28,726
Mr. Gieselman was a veteran who recently participated in the Veterans Day program at Medford High School.

566
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:34,891
Be resolved, the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Don Ferrara.

567
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:35,671
Ms.

568
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:38,654
Ferrara was a former custodian for the Medford Public Schools.

569
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:43,177
I would ask that we would all rise in a moment of silence.

570
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:46,358
for all those who have recently passed.

571
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:07,052
On those resolutions, all those in favor say aye.

572
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:07,432
Opposed, no.

573
00:39:07,452 --> 00:39:08,053
The ayes have it.

574
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:18,554
Report on the Veterans Day program, Mr. Superintendent.

575
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:25,501
Mayor and members of the committee, our Director of Curriculum, Bernadette Rigodelli, is going to deliver this report to you on our Veterans Day program.

576
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:28,024
Good evening.

577
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:38,135
To commemorate Veterans Day, the Humanities Department and the Office of Veterans Services worked together to sponsor the annual Veterans Day speaker program.

578
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:46,684
In its 15th year, this program provides high school students and faculty with the opportunity to directly interact with veterans.

579
00:39:47,462 --> 00:39:54,063
Veterans visit high school classrooms discussing with students their combat and non-combat related experiences.

580
00:39:54,643 --> 00:40:01,105
The program is an enormously rewarding experience for all involved, our students, faculty, and honored veteran guests.

581
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:16,208
This year's event took place on Thursday, November 5th, and was co-coordinated by the Director of Veteran Services, Mr. Ernest Lindsay, the Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, and lead social studies teacher, Nicholas Kane.

582
00:40:17,597 --> 00:40:19,219
The day began at 7.30 a.m.

583
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:27,347
in the superintendent's conference room with a light breakfast of coffee, donuts, juice, muffins, and fruit donated by Dunkin' Donuts in West Medford.

584
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:34,194
I will say that Dunkin' Donuts in West Medford has been donating goods for this event for several years.

585
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:36,376
We're very, very thankful to them.

586
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:43,341
Sandwiches and various salads were provided by the food services department at the high school for lunch.

587
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:54,269
21 veterans from several eras, including the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and the Iraq War, visited 38 classes and gave an overview of their military experiences and contributions.

588
00:40:55,775 --> 00:41:00,420
I will tell you that this year I noticed for the first time we had no World War II veterans.

589
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:07,548
It's the first year in the 15 years that it has been running that none were able to attend.

590
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:10,652
I know that Ernest Lindsay did reach out to them.

591
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:12,934
I know in one case he just didn't get a response.

592
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:14,616
We do not know what happened to that veteran.

593
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:17,692
In other cases, I know several of them have passed away.

594
00:41:17,752 --> 00:41:26,868
So I thought that was particularly sad, especially since I've been with the program first as a teacher and then as an administrator since its beginning in 2001.

595
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:36,898
This program provided our students with an authentic oral history of personal experiences that will enhance their study of history in the classroom.

596
00:41:37,338 --> 00:41:43,040
Feedback from students, teachers, and veterans from this year's program was overwhelmingly positive.

597
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,322
On the attachment, you can see a list of the veterans who did participate.

598
00:41:47,342 --> 00:41:58,265
And as was mentioned a little bit earlier, one of the veterans passed away soon after the presentation, and that was Mr. Michael Geiselman.

599
00:41:59,508 --> 00:42:01,530
I would be happy to take any questions at this point.

600
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:10,577
Mr. Mayor, through you to the superintendent, can we send a letter from the school committee thanking them for their time for our students?

601
00:42:12,378 --> 00:42:12,759
Thank you.

602
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:22,318
We do typically do that, and so on the thank you note, the thank you notes go out from each one of the classes.

603
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:27,241
Sometimes the class will provide one card with many signatures.

604
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:32,723
Other classes use it as a writing experience, and they write individual letters to the veterans.

605
00:42:33,263 --> 00:42:35,504
There's a certificate that typically goes out.

606
00:42:35,584 --> 00:42:40,466
It's signed by the mayor, the superintendent, and it will be signed by the director of humanities, Nicole Chiesa.

607
00:42:40,887 --> 00:42:41,587
Oh, that's great.

608
00:42:42,611 --> 00:42:47,612
I think that's great, and I thank them for their service both to our country and to our school children.

609
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:50,913
Thank you.

610
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:53,954
On the motion, Mr. Cuneo, that the report be accepted and placed on file.

611
00:42:53,994 --> 00:42:54,774
All in favor say aye.

612
00:42:54,794 --> 00:42:55,214
Opposed no.

613
00:42:55,234 --> 00:42:55,734
The ayes have it.

614
00:42:56,195 --> 00:42:57,615
The report is accepted and placed on file.

615
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,376
Item number nine, negotiations and legal matters.

616
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:00,996
There are no.

617
00:43:01,716 --> 00:43:05,497
Item number six, report on national assessment of educational programs.

618
00:43:07,397 --> 00:43:08,618
Mr. Mayor, members of the committee,

619
00:43:10,066 --> 00:43:19,054
The National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, is given every two years in English, Language Arts, and Mathematics.

620
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:26,521
And Massachusetts has consistently led the nation in this particular assessment.

621
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:36,430
Over 3,000 Massachusetts students were tested in each of the grades, four and eight, in both subject areas.

622
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:39,315
And there were Medford students included in this sample.

623
00:43:40,096 --> 00:43:46,459
I can't reveal names, but we're part of the distribution of youngsters who are taking this test.

624
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:58,945
According to the 2015 NAEP results, Massachusetts fourth graders had an average score of 235 in reading, which was higher than the 2013 score of 232, and above the national average of 221.

625
00:43:58,985 --> 00:44:00,926
50% of all Massachusetts students

626
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:11,280
scored proficient or above, which was significantly higher than the national average of 35%.

627
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:17,402
And performance of students with disabilities grew eight points from 2001 to 2009.

628
00:44:18,482 --> 00:44:22,423
English language learners also increased eight points from 192 to 200.

629
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:26,464
Now, I'm not going to read the whole report.

630
00:44:26,484 --> 00:44:27,444
You have the results here.

631
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,705
It gives you an idea of the general progress.

632
00:44:31,605 --> 00:44:34,226
I've also attached to you, for you,

633
00:44:35,635 --> 00:44:49,191
a report from Education Week, which gives you some real national data and some of the information that's associated with test administration in this area.

634
00:44:50,072 --> 00:44:52,274
People forget that the NAEP has been around a long time.

635
00:44:52,294 --> 00:44:54,297
They're talking about comparing states and the like.

636
00:44:55,116 --> 00:45:04,762
It's not the end all and be all, but it certainly gives us a very good snapshot of where Massachusetts stands among the various states in the country.

637
00:45:05,443 --> 00:45:09,525
And it tells us a little bit more than we would otherwise know.

638
00:45:10,246 --> 00:45:19,612
So we'll continue to review the statistics generated by NAEP and look at trends across the various assessments, variations from year to year,

639
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:36,942
are best kept in context because students change, the demography changes, and other assessments in concert with this maybe are used to provide information on other aspects of student progress.

640
00:45:37,763 --> 00:45:47,489
So it's a national analysis attached and a commentary by Education Week, which is a very respected journal that comments on education across the country.

641
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:49,831
I'd be happy to take any questions you may have.

642
00:45:52,788 --> 00:45:53,712
Just a quick comment.

643
00:45:53,732 --> 00:45:55,780
I'm glad that Massachusetts is still

644
00:45:56,469 --> 00:46:06,996
ranked so highly through our nation, but we, globally, our country needs to be aware and invest money into education because we don't want to lose our position there.

645
00:46:07,116 --> 00:46:11,859
And our scores have gone down, not Massachusetts, all scores a little bit.

646
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:23,706
And it's, I know that they're not expecting those type of scores to go down, but we, we only, we are doing well within the United States, but we need to up our game because we compete globally now.

647
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:24,587
It's a global world.

648
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,937
Um, thank you for the statistics.

649
00:46:26,997 --> 00:46:31,321
It was a great read and I'm glad that Massachusetts is still stuck at the top.

650
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:32,061
Thank you.

651
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:36,926
On the motion of Mr. Scott, probably the report be accepted in place on file.

652
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:41,310
All in favor signify in the ayes have it was accepted in place on file update report.

653
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:44,664
on park results and status, Mr. Superintendent.

654
00:46:44,724 --> 00:47:02,742
Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, as we are here this evening, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Board is meeting in Malden discussing the recommendations of Commissioner Chester to implement a hybrid

655
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:09,720
test that would combine MCAS as we know it and PARC as it is emergent.

656
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,342
And he's calling that MCAS 2.0.

657
00:47:14,304 --> 00:47:16,966
Now there's going to be a lot of people on different sides of the issues.

658
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:17,787
There'll be people that

659
00:47:19,735 --> 00:47:23,316
are recommending that MCAS be the standard.

660
00:47:23,836 --> 00:47:26,717
There'll be people recommending that PARC replace MCAS.

661
00:47:27,317 --> 00:47:30,478
There'll be people supporting the commissioner's position for a hybrid.

662
00:47:30,858 --> 00:47:34,258
And there'll be people arguing that testing should go away altogether.

663
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:37,119
It's going to be very interesting over the next couple of days.

664
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:44,781
I had the opportunity to talk to the Secretary of Education, James Pizer, on Saturday evening at the Children's Trust event.

665
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,561
And we talked a little bit about it.

666
00:47:46,581 --> 00:47:49,442
But I suspect that the board will probably approve

667
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:50,831
MCAS 2.0.

668
00:47:52,532 --> 00:47:54,092
I suspect that's what's going to happen.

669
00:47:54,653 --> 00:48:01,615
The bigger issue is how is this going to roll out, and who's going to take what, and when, and how much preparation is going to take place.

670
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:09,538
According to the commissioner's approach, if you've done MCAS in the past, you can continue to do MCAS for one more year.

671
00:48:10,058 --> 00:48:14,560
They might work in a few park type questions in there to try it out to see how people do.

672
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,001
If you were doing park, you'll continue to take park.

673
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:28,004
and there'll be some rollout activities, but the subsequent year, MCAS 2.0 would be the Commissioner's recommendation.

674
00:48:28,885 --> 00:48:34,170
I suspect that's what's going to count, but I don't know that for a fact as we stand here tonight.

675
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:38,655
I've also provided you some comparative results between

676
00:48:39,965 --> 00:48:53,318
MCAS and PARCC, and you can see that PARCC did not achieve as much in terms of student proficiency as MCAS did, because PARCC is allegedly a much more difficult, deeper thinking type test.

677
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,222
Whether you agree or disagree that testing

678
00:48:58,234 --> 00:49:00,896
It should take place or how much testing should take place.

679
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:07,302
We're going to get some answers at least over the next couple of days to at least get an idea of where the state wants to head.

680
00:49:07,942 --> 00:49:12,887
But I suspect the debate is going to continue for a long period of time as to how it's going to roll out.

681
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,901
and what it all means to all of us.

682
00:49:17,182 --> 00:49:18,903
I provided you with a lot of information.

683
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:25,846
I don't want to go through every page of it unless you have specific questions, and I'll be happy to address those specifics.

684
00:49:26,366 --> 00:49:33,850
And if we want to hold a larger meeting or a committee of the whole on it, once we know what the state has actually done, I think that would be a good idea.

685
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:34,511
Mr. Mayor.

686
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:34,991
Mr. Chairman.

687
00:49:35,011 --> 00:49:36,472
Mr. DiBenedetto.

688
00:49:38,077 --> 00:49:39,118
I just had a few comments.

689
00:49:39,158 --> 00:49:42,359
First of all, I really appreciated the data that you attached to this.

690
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:43,980
I found it very helpful.

691
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:57,866
So I just want the community to know that we would probably be continuing with MCAS since we did MCAS last year and we wouldn't take on the park at this moving forward because that program hasn't been approved yet.

692
00:49:58,906 --> 00:50:05,509
My second thing is the information about the cost of producing these tests

693
00:50:07,124 --> 00:50:09,385
$37 million is down here.

694
00:50:09,846 --> 00:50:18,310
It's amazing to me how much money we are spending as a commonwealth for a test as opposed to spending it actually on education.

695
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,082
It's just a personal comment.

696
00:50:22,962 --> 00:50:28,886
And they're not even sure how much it's going to cost to develop our own new MCAS 2.0.

697
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:36,971
So I'm going to be watching this closely and trying to be a strong voice and advocate for our students through the whole process.

698
00:50:37,391 --> 00:50:44,115
As I know you will, Mr. Superintendent, I know you have the ear of a lot of our state people who are making these decisions.

699
00:50:44,735 --> 00:50:49,218
So I would like you to keep us informed on any changes.

700
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:55,163
And make sure we make the proper decisions for our children and our community.

701
00:50:55,463 --> 00:50:56,123
Mr. Chairman?

702
00:50:56,584 --> 00:50:57,424
Mr. Schaffer?

703
00:50:57,744 --> 00:51:06,850
I would move that we convene in a committee of the whole meeting once the Department of Education has issued a statement on whether it's going to be PARCC or MCAS.

704
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:11,353
So we can discuss it and find out what the ramifications for the city will be.

705
00:51:11,754 --> 00:51:14,756
And if it will impact our budget in future years.

706
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,301
On that motion, Mr. Scarry?

707
00:51:17,321 --> 00:51:17,501
Second.

708
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:18,282
Second.

709
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:18,782
Seconded.

710
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:19,522
Seconded.

711
00:51:19,562 --> 00:51:20,062
All in favor say aye.

712
00:51:20,902 --> 00:51:20,982
Aye.

713
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:21,062
Aye.

761
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:28,724
Aye.

762
00:51:28,744 --> 00:51:28,824

765
00:51:29,985 --> 00:51:30,065

Aye.

799
00:51:34,126 --> 00:51:34,186
Aye.

800
00:51:34,206 --> 00:51:34,266
Aye.

801
00:51:34,286 --> 00:51:34,346
Aye.

802
00:51:35,086 --> 00:51:35,186
Aye.

803
00:51:35,206 --> 00:51:35,266

804
00:51:35,386 --> 00:51:35,466

Aye.

810
00:51:36,046 --> 00:51:36,186
Aye.

811
00:51:39,762 --> 00:51:43,787
I provided you with a fairly substantial package on school security issues.

812
00:51:45,248 --> 00:51:52,116
I'm going to go over some key points, make some recommendations, and then certainly I'm wide open to any comments you want to make.

813
00:51:52,617 --> 00:51:55,721
The only thing I would suggest is that I'm not going to go into

814
00:51:57,415 --> 00:52:08,902
very deep protocols because if I do that, I release information that should be kept tightly because it affects the safety and security of the operation of the schools.

815
00:52:09,702 --> 00:52:11,764
I will answer broader questions.

816
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:17,407
We have the principal of McGlynn and the principal of McGlynn Elementary with us this evening.

817
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:25,152
We have our director of elementary education here this evening to direct, to answer any questions that might be directed to that specific incident.

818
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:37,415
This report is divided into five parts to enable us to better focus on the specific elements of our current school security plans and possible enhancements to the system.

819
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:44,896
This report has multiple attachments to further describe and explain both current and possible security measures.

820
00:52:46,057 --> 00:52:48,457
The first part is devoted to the McGlynn incident.

821
00:52:49,177 --> 00:52:51,678
The second is the current security measures in place.

822
00:52:52,618 --> 00:52:55,439
The third is proposed additional security measures

823
00:52:56,688 --> 00:53:11,878
The fourth is about challenges, and the fifth area provides attachments that speak to the issues of security, safety, and provide you with ideas that we may or may not implement in your direction.

824
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:18,043
Now, on October 30th,

825
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:28,302
2015, an unauthorized female adult entered the McGuinn School through the middle school side entrance around 12.30 p.m.

826
00:53:29,242 --> 00:53:32,663
She entered at the same time that seventh grade students were returning from recess.

827
00:53:33,764 --> 00:53:37,285
The door through which she entered was monitored by a lunch attendant and a teacher.

828
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:40,746
However, she was not challenged at the point of entry.

829
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:46,527
She then proceeded to the elementary side of the building and encountered a teacher who asked, may I help you?

830
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:49,568
The intruder responded she was just looking for a pen.

831
00:53:50,891 --> 00:53:54,533
and she was not redirected to the main entrance or further challenged.

832
00:53:55,373 --> 00:54:03,577
During the next half hour, she went in and out of elementary classrooms and stole money, approximately $800 in total, from six different teachers.

833
00:54:04,538 --> 00:54:07,539
The individual then left the building through the back door.

834
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,581
No teacher or students were in the classrooms that she entered.

835
00:54:12,491 --> 00:54:22,837
her progression into the parking lot, entrance into the school, movement throughout the school, exit, and drive away from the parking lot were captured on the school's video camera surveillance system.

836
00:54:24,218 --> 00:54:31,102
The theft was reported by teachers to the elementary principal, Diane Guarino, in the afternoon after the students had left for the day.

837
00:54:31,983 --> 00:54:36,866
Principal Guarino reported that the theft to the superintendent who instructed her to file a police report.

838
00:54:37,727 --> 00:54:41,629
It was not clear at this time as to whether this was an inside or an outside job.

839
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:47,212
On Monday, Alan Arena, our network administrator, reviewed the video surveillance.

840
00:54:47,232 --> 00:54:50,374
There was multiple hours of video surveillance during that period.

841
00:54:50,394 --> 00:54:53,195
It identified the presence of the female intruder.

842
00:54:53,896 --> 00:54:55,337
The tape was provided to the police.

843
00:54:55,357 --> 00:55:03,941
The police shared the tape images with area police departments to alert them of possible persons of interest or person of interest.

844
00:55:04,782 --> 00:55:11,105
The information was picked up by Fox Media as they monitored these things.

845
00:55:11,843 --> 00:55:14,946
Fox began its coverage of the incident sometime Tuesday afternoon.

846
00:55:16,006 --> 00:55:18,228
Superintendent spoke with Fox on Tuesday evening.

847
00:55:19,629 --> 00:55:24,093
I emailed the school committee members in the early evening of that day describing the incident.

848
00:55:25,054 --> 00:55:28,196
Tuesday was a professional day in our school, so no students were present.

849
00:55:29,677 --> 00:55:39,405
The incident was not reported by the school administration from the outset to enable the police to proceed with their pursuit of the intruder, who probably did not know that she was on surveillance tape.

850
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:46,183
We also hope to avoid any panic or anxiety for parents coming to the school since students were not endangered at this time.

851
00:55:47,004 --> 00:55:50,366
The building administration intensified their security measures.

852
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:54,730
As of this time, the police have not identified the intruder.

853
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:59,693
The superintendent then met with all principals and reviewed security protocols.

854
00:56:00,654 --> 00:56:06,258
Responses were provided to email inquiries in the local press, and letters were sent home to parents.

855
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:08,400
You have a copy of the letter sent home from McGlynn.

856
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:11,638
The incident at McGlynn was not taken lightly.

857
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:13,839
It resulted from human error.

858
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:21,162
No unauthorized person should ever be allowed to enter the school without being challenged and redirected to security.

859
00:56:22,102 --> 00:56:23,823
This element is correctable.

860
00:56:24,823 --> 00:56:30,065
Our schools are busy places, and there are many individuals who must come and go on a daily basis.

861
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:36,008
Unknown, unauthorized persons must always be stopped, challenged, and redirected to security.

862
00:56:37,262 --> 00:56:41,464
I want to talk now about some of the current measures of security in place.

863
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:45,126
The Metro Public Schools take security very seriously.

864
00:56:46,147 --> 00:56:57,873
We were founding members of NMLEC, the Northeast Metropolitan Law Enforcement Council, and the STARS program, right after Columbine, that linked police to the schools on both a local and regional basis.

865
00:56:58,553 --> 00:57:02,335
Chief Sacco was the head of the task force, and I served on the committee.

866
00:57:03,856 --> 00:57:06,157
All main buildings of our schools have the following.

867
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,070
documented security emergency plans.

868
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,991
They conduct periodic drills at each building.

869
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:17,673
They have coordinated detailed war plans that were paid for by the STARS system.

870
00:57:18,693 --> 00:57:27,036
There are surveillance cameras, door monitoring and main door buzzer systems, shared police resource officers.

871
00:57:28,216 --> 00:57:32,378
We have the Nemlick STARS program, which allows us to call upon resources at a regional level.

872
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:40,891
in various types of capacities, everything from graphic analysis to psychological analysis to anything to a SWAT team.

873
00:57:42,612 --> 00:57:45,872
Various IDs and sign-in requirements exist in our schools.

874
00:57:46,973 --> 00:57:49,373
We have new enhanced phone systems that went in this year.

875
00:57:51,053 --> 00:57:53,914
Walkie-talkies and cell phones.

876
00:57:53,934 --> 00:57:55,814
911 access from any part of the buildings now.

877
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:59,715
Emergency medical plans, which you received earlier in the year.

878
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:06,095
Principles met with the superintendent and have reinforced the following in each building.

879
00:58:07,256 --> 00:58:14,300
One, all doors must be locked at all times unless they are being monitored by an assigned member of the staff.

880
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:21,744
Two, non-authorized individuals entering or traveling into our buildings must be stopped and questioned.

881
00:58:22,384 --> 00:58:24,625
They should be escorted to the main office for signing.

882
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:25,786
Three,

883
00:58:26,898 --> 00:58:30,420
Building guests must be wearing an appropriate ID badge issued by the school.

884
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:35,763
If there is resistance or concern, then assistance must be requested by notifying the office.

885
00:58:37,704 --> 00:58:38,924
The office must be alerted.

886
00:58:38,964 --> 00:58:51,791
Number four, if you see any strangers or suspicious individuals around or near the playground, if necessary, at the end of recess, bring students, end recess rather than bring students into the building.

887
00:58:53,092 --> 00:58:53,392
Five,

888
00:58:54,095 --> 00:59:00,938
For those staff members who are providing services to outside students, please provide the main office a schedule of those appointments.

889
00:59:02,218 --> 00:59:07,340
The main office will call to your room when they arrive so you can escort them from your office to the room.

890
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:23,167
Six, those staff members who hold after school detentions, after school academic support, band practice, and the like, must be stationed at the door as students are exiting the building in order to ensure no individuals are entering the building unauthorized.

891
00:59:25,379 --> 00:59:27,681
7.

892
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,681
All valuables must be in a secure place.

893
00:59:27,701 --> 00:59:27,681
8.

894
00:59:28,822 --> 00:59:32,746
The office will support the staff member and call for police backup at 9-1-1.

895
00:59:32,826 --> 00:59:39,292
A report will be filed for the principal and the principal will notify the superintendent's office.

896
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:48,196
Now, regular CBJ meetings, community-based justice meetings, are held weekly to review situations that require special attention.

897
00:59:48,896 --> 00:59:59,589
These happen with the police, the district attorney's office, and some of the social service agencies to go over anything happening on the street on weekends, happening in the courts, that might affect us.

898
01:00:00,935 --> 01:00:11,501
And we talk about those with our principals and we provide information should there be anyone in their area or anything going on in the neighborhood or anything happening in the weekend that requires special attention.

899
01:00:14,623 --> 01:00:18,446
Some proposed additional security measures in addition to existing measures.

900
01:00:19,026 --> 01:00:24,069
One, we are going to implement an enhanced ID system, the Raptor prototype.

901
01:00:24,629 --> 01:00:28,992
I can't say Raptor right now because it has to be put out through the procurement process.

902
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:36,188
But you have in your packet here a detailed explanation of the Raptor system.

903
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:41,111
The Raptor system currently exists at the vocational school.

904
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:45,314
It is a system in which all visitors will have a picture pass.

905
01:00:46,155 --> 01:00:54,401
So you take your license out or some other government ID, you put it into the system, and it prints a pass that goes on your clothing.

906
01:00:57,873 --> 01:00:59,694
The cost is about $2,000 per building.

907
01:01:00,614 --> 01:01:02,035
The vocational school is in place.

908
01:01:04,516 --> 01:01:10,599
We will implement and install a security alert system at all main doors to provide rapid response when needed.

909
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:22,084
We'll have available to the person as the security person a alert buzzer that will allow them to make an immediate call to an individual who can then make a 911 call.

910
01:01:22,184 --> 01:01:22,264
Okay?

911
01:01:26,513 --> 01:01:30,196
There are different proprietary systems available to us.

912
01:01:30,797 --> 01:01:37,022
Once again, we need to go through the procurement process to identify which one will be installed.

913
01:01:37,462 --> 01:01:40,825
And that will happen very quickly, because we'll move through an emergency process.

914
01:01:41,826 --> 01:01:46,489
We'll consider selective placement of additional building monitors at the high school complex.

915
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:47,610
Why the high school?

916
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:47,750
37 doors.

917
01:01:51,412 --> 01:01:54,114
Most schools only have a handful of doors that they can be monitored.

918
01:01:54,674 --> 01:01:56,356
The high school is much larger.

919
01:01:57,036 --> 01:01:59,518
Many more possibilities exist for entrance and exit.

920
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:05,262
We will insist on uniform dress for all security personnel, people or monitors.

921
01:02:05,282 --> 01:02:15,309
We will then provide them with proper attire, not police attire, but proper attire to identify them as building monitors, officials of the school.

922
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:17,130
Five.

923
01:02:17,793 --> 01:02:22,014
will improve notification with school committee and parents when incidents occur consistent with best practice.

924
01:02:23,534 --> 01:02:26,075
Superintendent made a decision.

925
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:30,696
Obviously, it was not something that everyone agrees with.

926
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:32,897
I understand your need to know.

927
01:02:33,677 --> 01:02:36,218
I certainly will ramp it up and take your guidance on that.

928
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:44,560
The only thing I ask from you is that if you get certain secure information, that it stays with you as opposed to anyone else.

929
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:56,227
because when we are in pursuit of an intruder or anyone, or something is going on in an investigation, I need to maintain a certain level of confidentiality consistent with best police practice.

930
01:02:56,907 --> 01:03:00,889
But you're entitled to know, that's my area, I accept responsibility for that.

931
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:02,810
We have challenges.

932
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:11,775
High school is a very large facility, with many doors, points of entry, and multiple all-day programs.

933
01:03:13,307 --> 01:03:17,673
Every assembly, every activity, people coming in for concerts, people coming in for athletic events.

934
01:03:17,733 --> 01:03:21,097
You can't stop everybody all the time.

935
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:26,885
We don't want to make the environment not conducive for learning, or not a friendly atmosphere.

936
01:03:26,905 --> 01:03:28,367
We don't want people to be driven away.

937
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,071
Well, at the same token, we need to maintain vigilance.

938
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:35,760
and have people who know who should be coming in and know who should not be coming in.

939
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:42,982
But we have ballgames, we have visitors who come from other schools, who come from other areas, press, other people that come into our world.

940
01:03:43,963 --> 01:03:46,903
Special events at every school where reasonable access is necessary.

941
01:03:48,104 --> 01:03:49,164
Bus transportation.

942
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:51,645
We have buses moving throughout the city.

943
01:03:52,345 --> 01:03:54,506
Outdoor events, many outdoor events.

944
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,146
Maintenance of security cameras.

945
01:03:57,727 --> 01:03:58,987
We have a lot of security cameras.

946
01:03:59,684 --> 01:04:03,926
But to keep them up and doing everything they need to do is a cost.

947
01:04:04,447 --> 01:04:11,390
And we'll probably have to pay that cost every year so that there are a few cameras that go down every year.

948
01:04:11,411 --> 01:04:13,752
We're going to have to do that.

949
01:04:13,772 --> 01:04:15,893
We'll have to upgrade some of them from time to time.

950
01:04:16,934 --> 01:04:18,394
Sometimes they're affected by weather.

951
01:04:18,995 --> 01:04:21,496
Sometimes they're affected by other factors that we don't know.

952
01:04:22,377 --> 01:04:28,260
But clearly, there's a cost that we're going to have to make a line item for to ensure that they're in place.

953
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:37,132
And then we have to have the most important thing, the uniform and diligent implementation of security protocols by all faculty and staff.

954
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:44,937
Human error, human implementation is our best source of protection.

955
01:04:45,377 --> 01:04:52,782
You see something that isn't right, you don't ask, you report it and let it get checked out.

956
01:04:53,743 --> 01:04:55,424
I'm gonna give you a little example today.

957
01:04:57,096 --> 01:05:08,163
Today, an individual in the back of the high school was going to put something in the dumpster, and they put a bag down on the ground next to their car as they went to do one other thing.

958
01:05:09,104 --> 01:05:17,229
Immediately, they got calls, and Jimmy Ricciardi was out there picking up the bag, checking it out, and make sure it wasn't something that shouldn't be there.

959
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:19,810
People have to be vigilant.

960
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:23,773
Some of these things will be overkill.

961
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:26,875
But if you see something that doesn't look right,

962
01:05:27,626 --> 01:05:32,287
You need to respond, and everyone has to take that seriously, because there's no other way.

963
01:05:32,907 --> 01:05:33,708
There's no other way.

964
01:05:36,408 --> 01:05:37,929
I've provided some attachments for you.

965
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:41,009
The Metro Public Schools Crisis Response Manual.

966
01:05:41,269 --> 01:05:42,270
It's very substantial.

967
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:51,652
Now, there are some pages in there that are part of another manual that are, like, for example, floor plans and the like, which aren't included in here, but that's confidential to us.

968
01:05:53,270 --> 01:06:11,513
The Massachusetts School Safety and Security Task Force report that came out in 2014 under Governor Deval Patrick and his safety officials suggested procedures by a responsive, or let's say a respected expert in the area on threat assessment in schools.

969
01:06:12,694 --> 01:06:20,295
We provided you with a copy of the sample emergency response procedures at the McGlynn School that every teacher has in their possession.

970
01:06:21,407 --> 01:06:25,988
I've given you a copy of the Raptor prototype ID system to look at.

971
01:06:26,008 --> 01:06:33,951
And you have a letter from the McGuinn parents, or sent to the McGuinn parents by the elementary principal.

972
01:06:35,832 --> 01:06:40,313
The safety of our students and staff is our highest priority.

973
01:06:41,733 --> 01:06:45,094
While there are challenges, we have many important security elements in place.

974
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,836
We'll work together with our principals, teachers, staff, parents, law enforcement,

975
01:06:50,249 --> 01:06:53,592
and community partners to enhance our capacity going forward.

976
01:06:54,933 --> 01:06:56,094
There's no perfect system.

977
01:06:56,994 --> 01:07:00,897
We live in a very dangerous world in many ways.

978
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,480
But we do everything we can do.

979
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,962
And we're open to additional suggestions.

980
01:07:07,683 --> 01:07:09,624
But I don't think there's a silver bullet out there.

981
01:07:09,644 --> 01:07:15,349
I don't think adding 10 more people to every school or another person there is going to change everything.

982
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:17,711
I think it's going to be selective and targeted.

983
01:07:18,484 --> 01:07:31,572
The biggest single factor will be making sure that everyone who works in the schools is a first responder, alerts people when they see something, and follows every protocol as they're laid out.

984
01:07:32,293 --> 01:07:34,094
Mr. Mayor, I'm prepared to take any questions.

985
01:07:34,114 --> 01:07:34,534
Mr. Mayor?

986
01:07:34,554 --> 01:07:36,355
Mrs. Vanden Heuvel.

987
01:07:37,356 --> 01:07:45,962
So this is a real tough one because, to me, it suggests clearly a weakness.

988
01:07:49,078 --> 01:07:55,141
And I'm grateful that in this particular case, the weakness only resulted in a theft of some money and nothing more severe.

989
01:07:56,141 --> 01:08:09,807
I am very concerned from the report that I received to understand, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I have to lay it at your feet, Mr. Superintendent, that you were informed of this on Friday afternoon.

990
01:08:09,867 --> 01:08:13,449
You directed Principal Garino to file a report with the police.

991
01:08:14,073 --> 01:08:20,516
And it wasn't until Monday that someone looked at the videotape.

992
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:38,385
Now, I understand it was Friday night, but I can't believe that someone didn't go in and arrange the proper people to look at the videotape so that on Monday morning, all of our principals would have been assessed of the problem.

993
01:08:38,806 --> 01:08:40,647
All of us, everybody would have been alerted.

994
01:08:40,987 --> 01:08:43,328
I understand that there was a concern of keeping

995
01:08:43,868 --> 01:08:49,532
the identity and the incident under wraps so that police could start.

996
01:08:49,953 --> 01:08:54,977
But wouldn't the police have wanted to see the video on Friday night as opposed to Monday morning?

997
01:08:55,577 --> 01:08:56,478
Could you please address that?

998
01:08:56,498 --> 01:08:58,619
Because I can't fathom it.

999
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:07,286
So again, it's probably something that could have been done, maybe should have been done.

1000
01:09:07,586 --> 01:09:08,387
Take the criticism.

1001
01:09:09,597 --> 01:09:13,900
But clearly, you know, we have certain people who are expert at certain things.

1002
01:09:14,721 --> 01:09:20,344
And there was a distinct feeling that it was an inside job, because no one saw anyone come and go.

1003
01:09:21,485 --> 01:09:26,028
It came afterwards when we did see the video, and we did file the police report.

1004
01:09:26,449 --> 01:09:28,910
So I'll take your criticism as something that we've done.

1005
01:09:30,551 --> 01:09:32,232
You know, simply a void in the future.

1006
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:32,933
We have to deal with it.

1007
01:09:33,272 --> 01:09:38,154
Well, I can't, I mean, I for one say, you know, take the criticism, you drop the ball.

1008
01:09:38,734 --> 01:09:46,538
And I truly believe that there was not a sense of urgency, it seems to me, on this incident.

1009
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:51,231
Again, I'm grateful that the incident stopped where it stopped, and it wasn't something more severe.

1010
01:09:52,071 --> 01:10:06,556
I understand that we've had protocols in place, and I do understand the human error part of it with the people who allowed the individual to go about the building without being escorted down to the office, which is what our policy calls for.

1011
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:13,498
But the fact of the matter is that once there was a known incident, it needed and deserved immediate attention.

1012
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:20,795
need to be sent, wait until Monday morning to figure out that it was, in fact, someone from the outside.

1013
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,717
And I am deeply disappointed.

1014
01:10:23,117 --> 01:10:26,900
I was reading this and sighing and groaning.

1015
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,682
And my husband said, you know, that's what the problem is.

1016
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:33,245
The problem is it always hurts the most when it's people you really respect.

1017
01:10:33,985 --> 01:10:36,407
And I really respect you, but I really think you blew it.

1018
01:10:37,268 --> 01:10:39,649
Mr. Chairman.

1019
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:49,993
Mr. Superintendent, I, too, am deeply disturbed, especially when a teacher and a lunch attendant just let this person walk in cavalierly.

1020
01:10:50,753 --> 01:10:57,936
What type of training do we have in place to alert teachers and lunch attendants and whoever else may be in the building that we employ?

1021
01:10:58,676 --> 01:11:03,638
If you see somebody that you don't know, ask them why they're there and ask them to identify themselves.

1022
01:11:04,058 --> 01:11:09,640
This goes back 10 or 15 years when I've always asked for IDs for our staff.

1023
01:11:10,411 --> 01:11:13,654
teachers and the like, and somehow it got shuffled off until recently.

1024
01:11:14,475 --> 01:11:21,480
You know, that in itself should have been a wake-up call years ago that we need to know what's coming and going from our buildings.

1025
01:11:22,061 --> 01:11:29,507
You know, the taxpayers spend an awful lot of money to get these buildings done, and we just can't have every Tom, Dick, and Harry waltzing in and out as they may.

1026
01:11:31,549 --> 01:11:37,194
So the RID systems in the schools, they're just not as uniform as they will be.

1027
01:11:37,962 --> 01:11:40,403
with the Raptor system or the Raptor prototype system.

1028
01:11:41,564 --> 01:11:42,644
We certainly need to do better.

1029
01:11:44,025 --> 01:12:00,292
The principals drill and run practices, you know, with their staff to go over these things at the beginning of the year, during the year, and still can't necessarily guarantee there won't be human error, but we certainly have made this an emphasis point.

1030
01:12:01,752 --> 01:12:07,495
Maybe sometimes adversity, especially if it didn't result in something much more difficult,

1031
01:12:08,475 --> 01:12:14,996
can further intensify the need for everyone to follow up intelligently and follow up more intensively.

1032
01:12:15,396 --> 01:12:21,498
So, again, take the criticism as something instructive, and we'll work on it.

1033
01:12:21,578 --> 01:12:22,418
We'll work on this.

1034
01:12:22,498 --> 01:12:25,879
You can see from what we're proposing, we're not taking this lightly at all.

1035
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:33,080
Is there a policy in effect that the teacher and the lunch attendant should have known that people just can't waltz in the door at recess time?

1036
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,921
Everybody who comes in should be challenged.

1037
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:35,961
We have information.

1038
01:12:36,641 --> 01:12:37,381
We have that here.

1039
01:12:37,581 --> 01:12:42,823
If you read it in some of the material, it's in the activity right there.

1040
01:12:43,543 --> 01:12:44,464
Hand it out.

1041
01:12:45,284 --> 01:12:48,805
And you know, again, we've got to keep driving it home.

1042
01:12:49,485 --> 01:12:50,486
Keep driving it home.

1043
01:12:50,586 --> 01:12:53,907
It's something that's not an error that you can allow to happen.

1044
01:12:53,927 --> 01:12:57,168
There's some things you can allow to happen, and you say, well, no harm to follow.

1045
01:12:57,348 --> 01:12:59,649
And security is not something that fits in that category.

1046
01:13:00,029 --> 01:13:02,370
Just because you give somebody a manual doesn't mean they're going to read it.

1047
01:13:02,866 --> 01:13:03,586
No, we go over it.

1048
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:04,107
We go over it.

1049
01:13:04,307 --> 01:13:10,629
I mean, you know, I have the principals of the McGlynn here tonight, and they can tell you what they do specifically if you care to talk to them about it.

1050
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:15,832
Do the individuals sign off upon receipt and indicate that they have read it and they understand what's in it?

1051
01:13:16,532 --> 01:13:18,093
Well, they don't sign off.

1052
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:20,094
Well, I think that should be a policy.

1053
01:13:20,614 --> 01:13:21,754
Maybe that's something we ought to do.

1054
01:13:22,335 --> 01:13:24,396
Take that as a piece of guidance.

1055
01:13:25,316 --> 01:13:27,097
God forbid something happened to a child.

1056
01:13:27,217 --> 01:13:28,958
It would be on all our minds.

1057
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:30,658
Well, I agree.

1058
01:13:30,938 --> 01:13:31,119
I agree.

1059
01:13:32,695 --> 01:13:33,696
This is not an excuse.

1060
01:13:33,796 --> 01:13:41,660
It's not an attempt to duck anything, but these buildings have been in place for a lot of years.

1061
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:42,900
This is the first incident.

1062
01:13:43,641 --> 01:13:44,581
It doesn't make it right.

1063
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:47,643
It's the first incident, and we can learn from it.

1064
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:48,583
We will learn from it.

1065
01:13:48,643 --> 01:13:49,524
We are learning from it.

1066
01:13:49,564 --> 01:13:50,624
We're doing things about it.

1067
01:13:50,664 --> 01:13:52,545
So I take your criticism, and we'll work on it.

1068
01:13:52,565 --> 01:13:54,526
No, but Mr. Superintendent, this shouldn't have been a first.

1069
01:13:54,846 --> 01:13:55,246
Right.

1070
01:13:55,887 --> 01:13:57,207
This should not have been a first.

1071
01:13:58,388 --> 01:13:59,629
Mr. Mayor.

1072
01:13:59,649 --> 01:14:00,069
Mr. Mayor.

1073
01:14:00,109 --> 01:14:01,850
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1074
01:14:04,118 --> 01:14:06,620
Uh, this is very, uh, concerning.

1075
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:15,227
Um, I, I didn't like the way I learned about it, but, uh, for me, it's about moving forward and trying to prevent it from happening again.

1076
01:14:15,247 --> 01:14:19,630
And, uh, I do think that my colleague did bring up a very good point.

1077
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:31,440
And I think that, you know, having everyone in the system, all staff and administrators, everyone reading the policy and then signing off on the policy that they have read it and they understand it.

1078
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:32,961
If they have any questions,

1079
01:14:33,475 --> 01:14:34,275
they should ask questions.

1080
01:14:34,295 --> 01:14:35,535
So I think that is a very good idea.

1081
01:14:35,715 --> 01:14:36,836
I know that's something that we do.

1082
01:14:37,276 --> 01:14:38,596
I know I do it professionally at work.

1083
01:14:38,636 --> 01:14:41,497
We have different policies that we do have to adhere to and we have to sign off on.

1084
01:14:41,517 --> 01:14:43,657
So I think that's a good idea.

1085
01:14:43,877 --> 01:14:52,599
With regard to, I know you have communicated to the principals about the different policies and whatnot.

1086
01:14:53,339 --> 01:15:03,121
Have the principals had staff meetings with each individual building to communicate to their staff

1087
01:15:04,309 --> 01:15:05,030
The policies.

1088
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,892
I think we have two principles here.

1089
01:15:06,932 --> 01:15:07,734
Let them address it.

1090
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:09,836
Let them tell you how they do it.

1091
01:15:10,177 --> 01:15:10,818
If you could please.

1092
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:11,819
Thank you.

1093
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:17,026
Because everybody has their own style a little bit, but certainly, you know, the message is the same.

1094
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:19,329
Good evening.

1095
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:20,079
Good evening.

1096
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:27,801
A couple things I'd like to say about this, because certainly the superintendent has shown fabulous leadership in this area since I've been principal.

1097
01:15:27,841 --> 01:15:28,741
This is my seventh year.

1098
01:15:29,082 --> 01:15:33,763
We talk about it consistently every year at all of our meetings we mention it.

1099
01:15:34,403 --> 01:15:35,383
We work hard at it.

1100
01:15:36,404 --> 01:15:43,646
We started reinforcing our plans when I became principal, and we all worked as a team.

1101
01:15:43,926 --> 01:15:44,106
Ms.

1102
01:15:44,226 --> 01:15:46,746
Andrews was very instrumental, who's now the assistant principal.

1103
01:15:46,766 --> 01:15:48,427
She was my guidance counselor at the time.

1104
01:15:49,571 --> 01:15:51,632
This was a fluke, I will tell you that.

1105
01:15:52,312 --> 01:15:57,794
And one of the things I want you to be aware of, because I take responsibility for this too, I assign those people at that door.

1106
01:15:58,174 --> 01:16:00,635
That door is no longer used and will never be used again.

1107
01:16:00,655 --> 01:16:06,737
I will be at the door every recess or Mr. Charles making sure that only our kids are coming in one door.

1108
01:16:07,238 --> 01:16:08,138
So we've changed that.

1109
01:16:08,938 --> 01:16:11,359
But this individual, the lunch lady, works very hard.

1110
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:12,660
She knows all the kids.

1111
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,140
She's been there for a very long time.

1112
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,041
She does a great job.

1113
01:16:15,101 --> 01:16:18,702
She alerts me to things all the time, as do my staff consistently.

1114
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:22,845
Even if they think it's nothing, I tell them all the time, it's okay.

1115
01:16:23,365 --> 01:16:25,287
You tell me about it, I will figure it out.

1116
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:26,768
We'll work together to figure it out.

1117
01:16:27,188 --> 01:16:29,670
There is consistent communication along those lines.

1118
01:16:30,351 --> 01:16:33,794
This particular individual certainly knew what they were doing.

1119
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:35,035
They knew a weak spot.

1120
01:16:35,695 --> 01:16:37,756
They also knew the time and the place.

1121
01:16:37,956 --> 01:16:39,037
They had some information.

1122
01:16:39,537 --> 01:16:43,300
She also, this person, looks identical to one of my 7th graders.

1123
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:47,222
If I showed you back to back pictures, you may not be able to tell them apart.

1124
01:16:47,742 --> 01:16:49,804
And I think that's what happened in this situation.

1125
01:16:50,544 --> 01:16:51,445
It shouldn't have happened.

1126
01:16:51,585 --> 01:16:52,705
It will not happen again.

1127
01:16:52,725 --> 01:16:55,247
I take responsibility for it happening.

1128
01:16:56,486 --> 01:17:00,470
Now we have one door that we come in from recess near the basketball court.

1129
01:17:01,691 --> 01:17:02,752
It was a traffic flow.

1130
01:17:02,912 --> 01:17:11,341
That's why we wanted to make sure that our kids weren't bumping into the elementary kids at lunch line and that our kids were not bumping into each other going up the stairway.

1131
01:17:12,102 --> 01:17:14,284
Middle schoolers can be clumsy going up and down the stairs.

1132
01:17:14,324 --> 01:17:18,369
We had some kids falling and we wanted to kind of even the flow.

1133
01:17:18,949 --> 01:17:20,250
But now we have a different policy.

1134
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:28,354
And it's okay because in our world today, some inconveniences, some patients, to have more security, that's the way we have to live.

1135
01:17:28,674 --> 01:17:30,455
And that's the way we're going to handle things from now on.

1136
01:17:34,145 --> 01:17:36,407
Have you met with your staff since the incident?

1137
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:37,087
We both have.

1138
01:17:37,107 --> 01:17:38,729
We've done a lot of drills this year.

1139
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:41,250
Even before this happened, they were all scheduled.

1140
01:17:41,711 --> 01:17:44,093
We've done many fire drills every month.

1141
01:17:44,113 --> 01:17:45,574
We did an evacuation drill.

1142
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:46,935
We've done a shelter in place.

1143
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:48,996
This Friday, we'll do a full lockdown.

1144
01:17:49,237 --> 01:17:50,998
We'll also do cafeteria lockdowns.

1145
01:17:52,179 --> 01:17:55,161
So I'm glad that you're doing that.

1146
01:17:55,201 --> 01:17:56,742
I think you always have to be prepared.

1147
01:17:57,703 --> 01:18:00,585
So it's good that you've gone through those drills.

1148
01:18:02,225 --> 01:18:14,507
Mr. Superintendent, have the other administrator principals met with their, yes, with their building, with their staff and they've notified everybody of their protocols and whatnot.

1149
01:18:14,747 --> 01:18:16,948
Everyone has been instructed to do that.

1150
01:18:16,968 --> 01:18:18,528
They were told to do it.

1151
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:21,849
I believe they've done it based on the information I have.

1152
01:18:23,489 --> 01:18:29,690
I'm sure everyone does it slightly differently, but I will take that idea about sign off very seriously.

1153
01:18:30,402 --> 01:18:31,923
make sure that, you know, I get those.

1154
01:18:31,983 --> 01:18:38,147
I did have the principal sign off to me on a document, you know, that they had done what they were supposed to do.

1155
01:18:39,127 --> 01:18:43,070
Um, I believe every building is covered and I believe they run regular drills.

1156
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:43,690
I know they do.

1157
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:45,591
I know they run regular drills.

1158
01:18:45,631 --> 01:18:52,975
I just want to make sure that since this incident that, you know, they, each building principal has met with your staff to let them know this has happened.

1159
01:18:53,556 --> 01:18:57,798
This is what we want to go over the protocols again to make sure it doesn't happen in our building.

1160
01:18:57,938 --> 01:18:58,919
It doesn't happen in any building.

1161
01:18:59,418 --> 01:18:59,779
Absolutely.

1162
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:07,269
We had a very, very productive meeting with the principals and then we told them to go back and make sure everyone knew what was expected of them.

1163
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:10,153
And I believe everyone did it with diligence.

1164
01:19:11,015 --> 01:19:13,178
Mr. Edwards, if I may, in your school,

1165
01:19:13,714 --> 01:19:17,416
Are the students required to wear IDs or have IDs on there?

1166
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:21,298
We did try that one year, because we do get the IDs from Life Touch.

1167
01:19:22,019 --> 01:19:27,501
But middle schoolers, so there was always 100 to 150 who did not have their IDs every day.

1168
01:19:27,682 --> 01:19:29,503
So now what do we do with those students?

1169
01:19:29,843 --> 01:19:31,163
Because middle schoolers forget things.

1170
01:19:31,203 --> 01:19:32,184
They forget their pencils.

1171
01:19:32,464 --> 01:19:33,545
They forgot their IDs.

1172
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:36,746
A lot of them wore them proudly, but many of them did not.

1173
01:19:36,827 --> 01:19:37,507
They lost them.

1174
01:19:37,887 --> 01:19:39,708
Some of them don't get their pictures taken.

1175
01:19:39,728 --> 01:19:41,849
They don't show up on that day to get their pictures taken.

1176
01:19:41,869 --> 01:19:42,970
They don't show up for retakes.

1177
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:45,512
So it was difficult to implement that.

1178
01:19:45,552 --> 01:19:48,313
If we could certainly try it again, I'd be happy to.

1179
01:19:48,794 --> 01:19:51,275
I mean, just from my personal experience, my son goes to the Andrews.

1180
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,296
They have IDs.

1181
01:19:52,316 --> 01:19:54,277
I assume they're the same type.

1182
01:19:54,698 --> 01:19:56,499
I think it's something that we should have.

1183
01:19:56,659 --> 01:19:59,061
I think this middle school and up should have IDs.

1184
01:19:59,501 --> 01:20:06,185
I think if there's an emergency in the building, you kind of know right away if someone belongs or not if they have their ID.

1185
01:20:06,245 --> 01:20:10,388
And if they don't come to school with the ID that day, then maybe they're issued a temporary ID.

1186
01:20:11,903 --> 01:20:14,603
I think it's a good way of knowing who belongs in the building and who doesn't.

1187
01:20:15,164 --> 01:20:15,984
Same thing with teachers.

1188
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:18,184
They should have IDs on them at all times as well.

1189
01:20:19,324 --> 01:20:23,505
I just think it's an indicator right away of who belongs in the building and who doesn't belong in the building.

1190
01:20:23,525 --> 01:20:25,245
Point of information, Mr. Mayor.

1191
01:20:25,305 --> 01:20:25,885
Mr. Schapiro.

1192
01:20:25,965 --> 01:20:41,588
I know that the school system that I work in, we have the X2 system, where if a child does forget their ID, that the homeroom teacher would print a picture that's provided with them

1193
01:20:42,173 --> 01:20:45,434
at the beginning of the year, and it's the student's information.

1194
01:20:46,134 --> 01:20:56,516
And I think that, I concur with what Mr. Falco and Mr. Skerry were saying, that I think that's something that, because if you saw some protocols as a former teacher, then we were there.

1195
01:20:56,996 --> 01:20:58,757
I know how hard you work in preparing us.

1196
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:11,580
There were safes that the teacher did stop the person, but a simple ID would have stopped everything.

1197
01:21:12,592 --> 01:21:14,512
I don't have a pen that doesn't answer.

1198
01:21:14,532 --> 01:21:18,433
You don't have your ID on, you get to the office, period.

1199
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,714
And most of the time that happens.

1200
01:21:20,954 --> 01:21:23,494
I'm alerted to people in the hallways all the time.

1201
01:21:24,534 --> 01:21:26,335
And sometimes I say, well, we don't want to upset them.

1202
01:21:26,355 --> 01:21:27,895
It's OK to upset them and blame it on me.

1203
01:21:28,235 --> 01:21:30,036
I'll handle that when they get down from the main office.

1204
01:21:30,276 --> 01:21:30,636
It's fine.

1205
01:21:31,216 --> 01:21:32,176
Anything for safety.

1206
01:21:32,576 --> 01:21:42,278
The other thing I want you to be aware of, and this is not to have an excuse at all, but that Mrs. Guarino and I were in the building that Friday evening till after 9 o'clock.

1207
01:21:42,518 --> 01:21:44,600
I'm going to give you a little bit of background on that.

1208
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:00,833
Mr. Scala and I used to be detectives trying to find these things a lot.

1209
01:22:01,514 --> 01:22:16,828
So we did not know that it was somebody from the outside at that time, but we did try everything we could to come up with the information that we needed to come up with to kind of eliminate those possibilities that it was somebody who was in at a meeting, a parent perhaps that day.

1210
01:22:18,209 --> 01:22:20,011
Mr. Mayor, I have one last question.

1211
01:22:20,391 --> 01:22:23,574
Mr. Superintendent, with regard to the challenges,

1212
01:22:24,385 --> 01:22:27,226
Uh, the first one is the high school and how it's a large facility.

1213
01:22:27,266 --> 01:22:30,327
So I believe you said this 37 points of entry.

1214
01:22:32,107 --> 01:22:44,111
So have we, have we, uh, thought about possibly seeking security advice from a security consultant or from Medford police as to how to safeguard that facility?

1215
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:48,953
I mean, 37 points of entry, that's a large number of points of entry.

1216
01:22:48,973 --> 01:22:50,173
I mean, I'm just thinking like,

1217
01:22:51,101 --> 01:22:57,924
someone that specializes in that would probably at least be able to give some sort of a professional opinion on how to secure it, or?

1218
01:22:59,084 --> 01:23:01,205
We've had multiple meetings on this over the years.

1219
01:23:01,225 --> 01:23:03,226
The high school is, what, 45 years old now?

1220
01:23:03,286 --> 01:23:04,186
Mm-hmm.

1221
01:23:04,206 --> 01:23:09,448
So at one time, as you may or may not remember, we had a whole CETA security force.

1222
01:23:09,809 --> 01:23:09,909
Right.

1223
01:23:09,969 --> 01:23:18,172
Mr. LaPorta was directing the team, and we even had a guardhouse at the middle of the hill coming up Steve Miller Drive before it was Steve Miller Drive.

1224
01:23:18,192 --> 01:23:19,653
We've had a lot of things.

1225
01:23:19,673 --> 01:23:20,713
We've gone over those things.

1226
01:23:21,823 --> 01:23:24,385
There are fire laws about exits and so on and so forth.

1227
01:23:25,105 --> 01:23:29,208
And, you know, again, we've had a lot of discussions about things.

1228
01:23:29,228 --> 01:23:31,630
People have come in and told us to use wands and things like that.

1229
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:34,592
But you can't turn the place into a prison.

1230
01:23:34,732 --> 01:23:37,434
You have to turn the place into an educational institution.

1231
01:23:37,854 --> 01:23:39,115
So we can certainly look at that.

1232
01:23:39,155 --> 01:23:48,141
I'd be happy to bring in someone else to have another discussion with that, along with the police chief and others, and see if we can't come up with something that gives us another dimension.

1233
01:23:48,733 --> 01:24:04,685
But the high school is probably the most problematic place because there are a lot of activities, there's community schools, there's the use of the pool, there's athletic events, there's concerts, there's meetings, there's all kinds of things, there's daycare, there's all kinds of things going on up there simultaneously.

1234
01:24:05,405 --> 01:24:06,626
And so that's our biggest challenge.

1235
01:24:07,267 --> 01:24:14,692
I mean, I don't think, I mean, I'm not a big fan of wands or any of that stuff, but I mean, I think just, I just think from the point of entry perspective,

1236
01:24:15,635 --> 01:24:17,821
That's a tough, it's a tough building to probably safeguard.

1237
01:24:17,841 --> 01:24:22,273
I'm just thinking, you know, as to, you know, maybe some professional advice would be.

1238
01:24:23,245 --> 01:24:24,065
Good way to go.

1239
01:24:24,086 --> 01:24:27,227
Superintendent, and we have had professional advice in the past.

1240
01:24:28,888 --> 01:24:33,850
If you go back a few years, you remember all the cameras that were installed in strategic locations.

1241
01:24:34,251 --> 01:24:40,994
The plan that said that certain doors would not be used, but there are still those who violate that from inside the building.

1242
01:24:41,634 --> 01:24:44,596
And sometimes those doors are left open.

1243
01:24:45,196 --> 01:24:49,839
I look at the report, nobody wanted the incident to happen, but as I look at the report,

1244
01:24:50,579 --> 01:24:58,804
The report is put together very well and they're looking at all aspects of how you take a situation that shouldn't happen and how you eliminate it.

1245
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:10,211
It was just a couple of years ago that we were all beating our chest because the news media was trying to break into, not break into, but gain entry into school systems around this whole area.

1246
01:25:10,571 --> 01:25:14,973
The only school system they couldn't get into a school was the city of Medford.

1247
01:25:15,534 --> 01:25:16,794
We were all very proud of that.

1248
01:25:19,092 --> 01:25:21,533
I know just in the last couple of weeks, I have been at the Columbus.

1249
01:25:21,613 --> 01:25:22,774
I have been at the McGlynn.

1250
01:25:22,914 --> 01:25:24,234
I have been at the Roberts.

1251
01:25:24,594 --> 01:25:29,977
I couldn't get into any of them because there is a good system in place.

1252
01:25:31,117 --> 01:25:44,203
Around the time that this incident happened, if you remember on the news, there was one individual in a different community who had been terminated, but still kept one of the uniform shirts and just walked in with everybody else.

1253
01:25:44,623 --> 01:25:48,685
There was another person who did the exact same thing that this person did.

1254
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:56,642
And maybe this person saw this on the news as to how you do it, but you go to another area and you try and float in with the kids.

1255
01:25:57,242 --> 01:26:03,384
Now it's a situation nobody wanted to happen, but it's a situation that everyone's working to address.

1256
01:26:04,144 --> 01:26:08,226
I don't care if it's a fire, a break-in or a criminal activity in the community.

1257
01:26:08,646 --> 01:26:16,168
The first report that you hear about what happened in that particular incident is never the factual report.

1258
01:26:16,632 --> 01:26:18,673
that is the same three or four days later.

1259
01:26:19,093 --> 01:26:23,554
That's why an investigation takes some time to look into all aspects of it.

1260
01:26:23,935 --> 01:26:26,355
So everybody has all of the facts correct.

1261
01:26:27,016 --> 01:26:39,640
As I'm listening to the administrators talk and the superintendent and everybody else, um, talked about the fact that, you know, we do have protocols in place, but

1262
01:26:40,608 --> 01:26:44,131
This person could have been a student, maybe not.

1263
01:26:45,673 --> 01:26:49,557
The people do need some more training, do need some more direction.

1264
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:51,498
They should be signed in the report.

1265
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:57,984
And then you move forward to make sure that you have a secure school system.

1266
01:26:58,765 --> 01:27:05,892
We have a secure school system, but we want to make sure that situations like that do not continue to happen.

1267
01:27:07,017 --> 01:27:10,760
And I think if you look at the past records, you will see how well it is.

1268
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:23,429
We even had people in here one night from Massport who were talking about a competition between the Americans and the Israelis as to who could penetrate each other's airports quicker.

1269
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:29,314
Because at that time, we were talking about putting the airport security in as you go in and out of the high school.

1270
01:27:29,714 --> 01:27:32,436
And then the wands, and everybody wanted them at the time.

1271
01:27:32,996 --> 01:27:33,857
They said they can do that.

1272
01:27:35,463 --> 01:27:45,710
The same thing will happen to you as it happened to us is when at Logan Airport, they spent $5 million on a new secure system, and the Israelis said, we can penetrate that in less than 30 seconds.

1273
01:27:46,271 --> 01:27:50,574
So you never know when someone's coming on a plane or how they're going to attempt to do that.

1274
01:27:51,374 --> 01:27:59,180
But the person simply walked through the area where they had all of the, what do you call that?

1275
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,421
Detectors.

1276
01:28:00,821 --> 01:28:01,982
Whatever they call it, detectors.

1277
01:28:02,435 --> 01:28:09,417
They walked right through, he put down his cup of coffee, went through the detector, nothing went off, picked up the cup of coffee, said, hey, here's a hand grenade, everyone's dead.

1278
01:28:10,738 --> 01:28:24,182
And he said, the point of telling you that is, even though we go above and beyond trying to make sure that no one can get in those schools without any circumstances, he said, if somebody wants to do something, they don't have to do it in the school.

1279
01:28:25,662 --> 01:28:28,803
They can do something outside the school.

1280
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:31,164
And that was the point of it, but we have still,

1281
01:28:31,983 --> 01:28:41,645
since that time, still gone above and beyond to make secure facilities that are up to this point almost impossible to get into.

1282
01:28:42,385 --> 01:28:53,408
But you had, as you said, I don't know if we call it a fluke, but a situation that everybody's working together to make sure it doesn't happen and move forward.

1283
01:28:55,448 --> 01:28:56,048
Mr. Mayor.

1284
01:28:57,789 --> 01:28:58,689
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

1285
01:28:59,573 --> 01:29:00,433
Thank you.

1286
01:29:00,693 --> 01:29:19,678
Through you to the superintendent, this report is refreshing because you went through every section of it, and you took accountability for areas of weakness, and you showed areas that we need to do better, and our growth has to happen.

1287
01:29:21,298 --> 01:29:28,780
On the list from 1 to 10, where principals have met with superintendent and reinforced the following at each building,

1288
01:29:29,223 --> 01:29:38,626
You have till number 10, whereas the principal notified the superintendent's office, this should be a number 11, where the superintendent's office notifies this committee.

1289
01:29:39,226 --> 01:29:47,028
And I think that communication with the committee, as we've repeatedly asked for that, and actually we voted on it on this floor.

1290
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:51,809
And I am going to hold you accountable for that going forward.

1291
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:58,271
I understand that when there's an investigation, we might not get all the information, but we should know what's going on.

1292
01:29:58,687 --> 01:30:00,891
within the school systems immediately.

1293
01:30:01,513 --> 01:30:03,116
Immediately, Mr. Superintendent.

1294
01:30:03,717 --> 01:30:07,865
Also, parents were extremely upset because they weren't notified.

1295
01:30:08,548 --> 01:30:14,430
in a timely manner, that there was a security breach, and that's what I would call it, a security breach within our buildings.

1296
01:30:15,071 --> 01:30:18,952
And, you know, we all love our students and our children in this community.

1297
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:31,117
We do the best possible job we can, and this is a place for us to learn from what, as the world changes and as people do things that we have to change with them.

1298
01:30:31,477 --> 01:30:32,898
We have to do upgrades.

1299
01:30:32,998 --> 01:30:37,800
This is an area of growth that we need to do, and I think as a committee we should have

1300
01:30:38,253 --> 01:30:48,520
Committee of the Whole to discuss school security, the policies and procedures in place, what new policies and procedures that we're gonna take in effect going forward.

1301
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:54,283
We're gonna learn from this incident and we're gonna make our schools safer and stronger because of it.

1302
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:58,186
And we're gonna look forward and not backwards from this point on.

1303
01:30:58,766 --> 01:31:03,629
So those are my comments and I'm making a motion for Committee of the Whole.

1304
01:31:07,227 --> 01:31:08,047
Any further discussion?

1305
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,048
On that motion, all in favor say aye.

1306
01:31:10,088 --> 01:31:10,208
Aye.

1307
01:31:10,228 --> 01:31:10,288

Aye.

1336

Aye.

1337

Aye.

1338
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:15,710
Aye.

1339
01:31:15,730 --> 01:31:15,870
Aye.

1340
01:31:15,890 --> 01:31:15,970
Aye.

1341
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:16,690
Aye.

1342
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:16,850
Aye.

1343

Aye.

1348
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:17,471
Aye.

1349
01:31:17,551 --> 01:31:17,631
Aye.

1350
01:31:17,651 --> 01:31:17,711
Aye.

1351
01:31:17,731 --> 01:31:17,791
Aye.

1352

Aye.

1355
01:31:18,051 --> 01:31:18,111
Aye.

1356
01:31:18,131 --> 01:31:18,191
Aye.

1357
01:31:18,251 --> 01:31:18,391
Aye.

1358
01:31:18,451 --> 01:31:18,531
Aye.

1359
01:31:18,551 --> 01:31:20,612
Aye.

1360
01:31:20,632 --> 01:31:20,692
Aye.

1361
01:31:20,712 --> 01:31:20,872
Aye.

1362
01:31:21,032 --> 01:31:21,312
Aye.

1363
01:31:21,332 --> 01:31:21,392
Aye.

1364
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:21,612
Aye.

1365
01:31:21,632 --> 01:31:22,192
Aye.

1366
01:31:22,232 --> 01:31:22,412
Aye.

1367
01:31:22,472 --> 01:31:22,532
Aye.

1368
01:31:22,552 --> 01:31:22,632
Aye.

1369
01:31:22,652 --> 01:31:22,792
Aye.

1370
01:31:22,832 --> 01:31:22,913
Aye.

1371
01:31:22,953 --> 01:31:23,053
Aye.

1372
01:31:23,073 --> 01:31:23,133
Aye.

1373
01:31:23,153 --> 01:31:23,213
Aye.

1374
01:31:23,273 --> 01:31:23,353
Aye.

1375
01:31:23,413 --> 01:31:23,473
Aye.

1376
01:31:23,593 --> 01:31:23,693
Aye.

1377
01:31:23,713 --> 01:31:23,773
Aye.

1378
01:31:24,033 --> 01:31:24,113
Aye.

1379
01:31:24,133 --> 01:31:24,193
Aye.

1380
01:31:24,233 --> 01:31:24,333
Aye.

1381
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:24,413
Aye.

1382
01:31:24,453 --> 01:31:24,553
Aye.

1383
01:31:24,573 --> 01:31:24,653
Aye.

1384
01:31:24,753 --> 01:31:24,833
Aye.

1385
01:31:24,853 --> 01:31:24,913
Aye.

1386
01:31:24,933 --> 01:31:25,213
Aye.

1387
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:25,393
Aye.

1388
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:25,493
Aye.

1389
01:31:25,573 --> 01:31:25,694
Aye.

1390
01:31:25,954 --> 01:31:26,034
Aye.

1391
01:31:26,194 --> 01:31:26,294
Aye.

1392
01:31:26,394 --> 01:31:26,494
Aye.

1393
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:26,574
Aye.

1394
01:31:27,854 --> 01:31:27,914
Aye.

1395
01:31:27,974 --> 01:31:28,054
Aye.

1396
01:31:28,114 --> 01:31:28,194
Aye.

1397
01:31:28,214 --> 01:31:28,294
Aye.

1398
01:31:28,314 --> 01:31:28,394
Aye.

1399
01:31:28,434 --> 01:31:28,575
Aye.

1400
01:31:28,635 --> 01:31:28,775
Aye.

1401
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:29,035
Aye.

1402
01:31:29,055 --> 01:31:30,815
Aye.

1403
01:31:30,835 --> 01:31:31,115
Aye.

1404
01:31:31,175 --> 01:31:31,255
Aye.

1405
01:31:31,295 --> 01:31:31,376
Aye.

1406
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:31,496
Aye.

1407
01:31:31,516 --> 01:31:31,656
Aye.

1408
01:31:31,676 --> 01:31:31,776
Aye.

1409
01:31:31,796 --> 01:31:31,916
Aye.

1410
01:31:31,936 --> 01:31:32,176
Aye.

1411
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:34,461
It's common sense.

1412
01:31:35,062 --> 01:31:38,224
If you don't know who the person is, you don't let them in.

1413
01:31:38,965 --> 01:31:43,069
So we could sit here and we could talk about protocols, which I believe in.

1414
01:31:43,609 --> 01:31:48,034
We could sit here and say we have to sign off and make sure everybody gets trained, which I understand.

1415
01:31:49,579 --> 01:31:51,440
But it's also common sense.

1416
01:31:52,221 --> 01:31:54,302
I mean, am I the only one who's thinking this tonight?

1417
01:31:54,863 --> 01:32:03,769
If someone comes to the door, if someone comes in, if a teacher asks why you're here, they don't recognize that person, you don't let them in.

1418
01:32:04,029 --> 01:32:05,450
You let them go through the front.

1419
01:32:06,191 --> 01:32:07,972
I mean, I know it's easier said than done.

1420
01:32:08,132 --> 01:32:09,714
I understand that there are a lot of students.

1421
01:32:10,114 --> 01:32:12,796
I understand that- Point of information.

1422
01:32:12,816 --> 01:32:13,656
Mr. Falco.

1423
01:32:14,117 --> 01:32:15,618
I believe the person snuck in.

1424
01:32:15,999 --> 01:32:16,319
They didn't.

1425
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:17,700
The person looked like a child.

1426
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:17,980
Yeah.

1427
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:18,320
They didn't.

1428
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:19,420
No one was.

1429
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:28,323
Well, then there's conflict of stories, because there's also been stories that they have been stopped, and they were asked a question.

1430
01:32:28,423 --> 01:32:29,423
Once they got in the building.

1431
01:32:29,604 --> 01:32:29,844
Yes.

1432
01:32:29,924 --> 01:32:30,024
OK.

1433
01:32:30,224 --> 01:32:32,465
So once they got in the building, they were asked a question.

1434
01:32:32,885 --> 01:32:37,166
If they didn't know who that person was, you escort them to the office.

1435
01:32:38,006 --> 01:32:39,627
It's absolutely what everybody said.

1436
01:32:39,807 --> 01:32:40,527
It's been done.

1437
01:32:41,127 --> 01:32:42,748
We can't change it.

1438
01:32:43,048 --> 01:32:45,489
We thank God that nothing has happened.

1439
01:32:46,425 --> 01:32:48,166
I think we all are responsible for this.

1440
01:32:48,186 --> 01:32:52,967
I mean, the other thing I'm looking at is the Fox media.

1441
01:32:53,828 --> 01:33:00,830
If we're in a situation that, God forbid, this was about stealing, but let's say it was even higher than that.

1442
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:07,573
And we've been told by our police not to have anybody know because they're in the middle of this right now.

1443
01:33:08,113 --> 01:33:13,937
I don't believe in the time frame of it because it did happen on Friday and we didn't find out until Monday or Tuesday.

1444
01:33:14,437 --> 01:33:24,642
But what I'm trying to say is that if the police are in the middle of this and they are in the middle of an investigation and the media decides to leak it somewhere, isn't that jeopardizing us?

1445
01:33:24,822 --> 01:33:27,084
Isn't there any type of repercussion on them?

1446
01:33:28,514 --> 01:33:30,876
I mean, these are questions I'd like to know.

1447
01:33:31,437 --> 01:33:33,518
As far as the ideas, I totally agree.

1448
01:33:34,179 --> 01:33:44,007
I mean, as far as, you know, Mr. Edwards, I know that you said it's difficult and all that, but the thing is that if a student forgets the first day, the second day, the third day, there has to be repercussions.

1449
01:33:44,488 --> 01:33:52,975
If you're going to be doing something just like anything else, you don't bring your homework, you don't bring your homework into class, if you don't take a test, I mean, that's why we're here.

1450
01:33:53,035 --> 01:33:55,337
We're here to teach these kids that

1451
01:33:56,074 --> 01:33:58,996
You just can't continue doing what needs to be done.

1452
01:33:59,096 --> 01:34:00,397
I mean, I work at a building.

1453
01:34:00,417 --> 01:34:01,138
I have an ID.

1454
01:34:01,438 --> 01:34:02,519
That's not in place.

1455
01:34:02,659 --> 01:34:03,279
That's what I'm saying.

1456
01:34:03,299 --> 01:34:04,340
It's not Mr. Edwards' fault.

1457
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:05,140
No, no, no.

1458
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,822
I'm not saying it was his fault.

1459
01:34:06,902 --> 01:34:09,824
I'm just saying, everybody has their opportunity to speak.

1460
01:34:09,864 --> 01:34:13,526
I just want to say that I agree with the IDs.

1461
01:34:16,029 --> 01:34:19,932
And as far as even the high school, a lot of the times I'm up there.

1462
01:34:20,673 --> 01:34:22,595
And again, you can have all the protocols you want.

1463
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:36,568
But if you have certain groups that come in there and decide that they want to leave the door open because it's too hot in a room or because they're going in and out of their car to pick up something to bring it into a different room, I've gone and I've shut the door myself.

1464
01:34:36,968 --> 01:34:37,909
They've gotten mad at me.

1465
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:48,081
But we can have all the protocols we want, but if people don't listen and they don't abide by them, then where does this stand?

1466
01:34:48,161 --> 01:34:48,722
Where is this?

1467
01:34:49,223 --> 01:34:50,664
I mean, this is what I'm trying to find out.

1468
01:34:50,704 --> 01:34:57,012
I mean, we could have all these laws and protocols, but if people within our own school system, and I'm not saying your school,

1469
01:34:57,372 --> 01:34:59,134
because you have done a tremendous job.

1470
01:34:59,234 --> 01:35:04,658
I've been at the McGlynn, I was a parent at the McGlynn, and there were many times I couldn't even get into the McGlynn.

1471
01:35:04,718 --> 01:35:08,281
So it has nothing to do with the McGlynn, it's just in general.

1472
01:35:08,381 --> 01:35:22,092
We have 37 doors at the high school, we have multi events that are going on, but at times there are also people that have events in our own school system within that if you ask them to abide by the protocol,

1473
01:35:23,507 --> 01:35:24,107
They don't.

1474
01:35:24,747 --> 01:35:27,468
And then they'll say, you know, certain things.

1475
01:35:27,629 --> 01:35:32,490
So, I mean, they've been, they've been addressed, but we have to keep on addressing them.

1476
01:35:34,731 --> 01:35:35,731
Mr. Bellson.

1477
01:35:36,432 --> 01:35:40,233
So I'm responsible for the school system.

1478
01:35:41,874 --> 01:35:44,495
Tonight, I've told you what I think happened.

1479
01:35:44,515 --> 01:35:48,056
I've told you what we plan to do about it.

1480
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:51,057
You've given me some additional suggestions.

1481
01:35:51,807 --> 01:35:53,809
We're going to meet and we're going to follow up some more.

1482
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:55,691
We've met with our principals.

1483
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,675
I'm just going to suggest that this is an ongoing process.

1484
01:35:59,716 --> 01:36:02,138
You know, one time, two times, three times, not enough.

1485
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:03,100
It has to happen all the time.

1486
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:06,323
We have to constantly refresh ourselves, constantly have the discussion.

1487
01:36:07,104 --> 01:36:08,165
But I do ask one thing.

1488
01:36:09,627 --> 01:36:12,390
Let's not create fear and anxiety in the community.

1489
01:36:13,863 --> 01:36:18,326
For the most part, our schools are very safe, a lot safer than a lot of schools around us.

1490
01:36:18,366 --> 01:36:20,727
We have a lot more in place, and you've supported that.

1491
01:36:20,887 --> 01:36:21,848
The city has supported that.

1492
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:27,352
There are some people that would like to make it sound as if our schools are not safe.

1493
01:36:28,793 --> 01:36:31,334
It doesn't mean there's an excuse for what happened.

1494
01:36:32,395 --> 01:36:34,256
But overall, our schools are very safe.

1495
01:36:34,936 --> 01:36:41,761
It's important that we send that message out, because we want our young people and our families to come to our schools and not be afraid.

1496
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:46,152
But we have to continuously work at it, and that's our responsibility.

1497
01:36:46,172 --> 01:36:47,593
And maybe this is a good wake-up call.

1498
01:36:48,354 --> 01:36:52,177
Maybe this is a way of reinforcing our efforts and moving forward.

1499
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:56,400
I want to address one other thing that I read on a blog recently.

1500
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:02,845
I want to make sure that if anyone in the public is listening or anyone is picking this up, you understand that.

1501
01:37:04,626 --> 01:37:12,252
When we withheld some information from the public, we didn't do it because there was an election.

1502
01:37:14,866 --> 01:37:20,109
The two individuals running for the top seat in the city have nothing to do with the security of the schools.

1503
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:24,391
Neither one of them had an advantage or disadvantage from the event.

1504
01:37:25,311 --> 01:37:31,875
And people that would like to ascribe those kinds of things to the electoral process are way out of line.

1505
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:38,999
We did it because we felt it was consistent with best police investigative process.

1506
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,500
I should have notified the school committee.

1507
01:37:41,966 --> 01:37:47,170
I accept that as legitimate criticism of me, and I'll do better.

1508
01:37:48,431 --> 01:37:54,796
But as far as holding it for some nefarious reason, that's pure BS.

1509
01:37:54,856 --> 01:37:57,638
It has nothing to do with what we do.

1510
01:37:58,899 --> 01:38:06,925
We don't politicize situations in our schools, certainly not ones about the safety and security of our young people, our faculty, and our staff.

1511
01:38:08,346 --> 01:38:11,367
And anyone who tries to do that is going to hear from me.

1512
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,388
Cut, dry, and simple.

1513
01:38:14,669 --> 01:38:15,369
Can we improve?

1514
01:38:15,569 --> 01:38:15,809
Yes.

1515
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:16,990
Will we improve?

1516
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:17,510
We have to.

1517
01:38:18,431 --> 01:38:20,111
Will we do everything we possibly can?

1518
01:38:20,651 --> 01:38:21,192
Absolutely.

1519
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:28,995
But in no way, shape, or form will I be silent when people try to politicize this event.

1520
01:38:30,856 --> 01:38:32,757
We need to get everybody behind us.

1521
01:38:33,337 --> 01:38:34,798
We need parents, kids.

1522
01:38:35,687 --> 01:38:39,831
faculty, staff, to understand that it's a shared responsibility.

1523
01:38:40,832 --> 01:38:42,393
It's a shared responsibility.

1524
01:38:44,435 --> 01:38:52,903
And when we do that, we have the best opportunity to keep our kids safe, to keep our world safe, and to promote education in our community.

1525
01:38:53,664 --> 01:38:55,085
So I appreciate what you're telling me.

1526
01:38:56,266 --> 01:39:00,911
If there's improvement to be made, it's mine, and I'll work at it, and we'll go from there.

1527
01:39:02,147 --> 01:39:04,829
On the motion, Mr. Skerry, the report be accepted and placed on file.

1528
01:39:04,909 --> 01:39:05,850
All those in favor say aye.

1529
01:39:05,950 --> 01:39:06,050
Aye.

1530
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:06,530
Opposed, no.

1531
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:08,572
The AICF report is accepted and placed on file.

1532
01:39:09,112 --> 01:39:10,953
The motion is now adjourned.

1533
01:39:11,053 --> 01:39:11,654
Old business?

1534
01:39:14,055 --> 01:39:16,657
Just a few things.

1535
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:18,519
I've requested the community.

1536
01:39:18,599 --> 01:39:26,424
I forgot to put it on the agenda, but I've requested the community schools budget, and I've also requested

1537
01:39:27,965 --> 01:39:33,578
The budget of the fields, the rentals, and the income, as well as all school facilities.

1538
01:39:34,099 --> 01:39:36,344
I think this is the third request.

1539
01:39:36,364 --> 01:39:36,985
Okay, that's fine.

1540
01:39:37,005 --> 01:39:41,976
This is the third request and I hope to see it next committee meeting.
