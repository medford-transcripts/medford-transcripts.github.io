1
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:39,051
Thank you.

2
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:17,984
Just a group to talk for time.

3
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:20,045
Talk about each other.

4
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:21,386
Talk to each other.

5
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,171
Is he doing better though?

6
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,772
Oh yeah, he's doing great.

7
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:40,632
Hi, how are you?

8
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:41,773
Good to see you.

9
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:41,933
Yes.

10
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:42,513
Hello, how are you?

11
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:43,153
Hi, so I'm here.

12
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,074
I'm here to see Kathleen.

13
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:45,254
Hi.

14
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,055
How are you?

15
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:46,895
Good to see you.

16
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:05,855
Thank you.

17
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:06,395
Thank you.

18
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:07,076
Thank you.

19
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:07,576
Thank you.

20
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:08,216
Thank you.

21
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,596
Thank you.

22
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:36,001
Yes.

23
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:05,676
It's not cold.

24
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:07,097
It's not.

25
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:08,357
It's all in my head.

26
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:10,398
Yeah, right, right, right.

27
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:11,359
Tomorrow it'll be cold.

28
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,100
It's worse than cold.

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,461
That's right.

30
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:18,283
No one wants to sit up in the front row with me?

31
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:21,685
Well, you're not supposed to teach it.

32
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:22,225
Why not?

33
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:23,566
It'll spread out.

34
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:24,546
You're still doing your thing.

35
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:31,371
Let's do it.

36
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,033
It's like a leftover Halloween pumpkin, but I'm warm.

37
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:15,177
Yes.

38
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:40,605
Thank you.

39
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:56,614
Thank you.

40
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:29,005
Great.

41
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:29,965
Oh, my gosh.

42
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,506
I know she does.

43
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:32,166
Yeah.

44
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:32,307
Yeah.

45
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:33,047
She's fine.

46
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:33,267
Yeah.

47
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:33,627
Yeah.

48
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:58,170
You want to find it?

49
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:03,502
I know.

50
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:03,922
I know.

51
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:04,842
Give me one minute.

52
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:33,225
th th

53
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:05,555
Okay.

54
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:25,513
We don't have a

55
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,377
Am I in the right seat?

56
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:51,217
You're in the right seat.

57
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:51,478
Okay.

58
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:51,878
You good?

59
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:52,939
I am good.

60
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,960
All right, I'm gonna get some water.

61
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,781
We'll get started.

62
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:56,241
All right.

63
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:56,641
That's nice.

64
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:21,796
Yeah.

65
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:22,639
Yeah.

66
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,378
I love you.

67
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:15,825
.

68
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,825
We'll pick them up okay you all right with that.

69
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:16,265
I'm gonna try.

70
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,746
Just you know just bring up close.

71
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:43,795
Check, check.

72
00:09:57,044 --> 00:09:57,725
He's feeling her.

73
00:09:58,425 --> 00:09:58,565
OK.

74
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:36,116
It's like the shower.

75
00:11:12,553 --> 00:11:13,133
We good, son?

76
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:14,735
Yeah.

77
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:14,955
OK.

78
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,077
Good evening, friends and neighbors.

79
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:25,444
My name is Terry E. Carter, and I direct elder services at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

80
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:34,091
Welcome to another live monthly presentation of First Friday's Words and Music, our first in 2023.

81
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:45,284
It's February, Black History Month, and despite the freezing cold outside, we're warm and toasty in the building.

82
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:56,453
Thanks to a generous grant from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, we are doing our thing again at 111 Arlington Street.

83
00:11:57,444 --> 00:12:02,648
We are, of course, still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns.

84
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:08,812
So masking is optional, perhaps recommended, but certainly not required.

85
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:16,018
We've emerged unscathed from a jubilant and very successful MLK celebration on January 16.

86
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:22,983
And on the whole, we feel good about sponsoring live programming here at the WMCC.

87
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:25,745
It's happening all over the city of Medford.

88
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:35,570
As well, we ask you to please be courteous to your neighbors as we move through the evening.

89
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:41,193
We are appreciating the media work put in by team member Kyle Douglas.

90
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:55,338
uh... and thanks also to Kevin Harrington and Medford Community Media for guiding us as we broadcast via Medford Community Media channels 3 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon.

91
00:12:55,758 --> 00:13:01,280
If you're out there watching on your electronic devices or your television, welcome to the show.

92
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,782
You can also access the show online on the MCM YouTube channel.

93
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:15,179
The real power of New England weather is definitely upon us tonight.

94
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,624
That means we have to be prepared for unforeseen challenges in the local landscape.

95
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:32,292
You were no doubt expecting to see new NAACP President Jillian Harvey sitting in with me tonight for a local conversation.

96
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:39,719
Unfortunately, Jillian has taken ill and is regretfully unavailable this Friday.

97
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:47,121
We have rescheduled her visit to March, and I assure you that she is anxious to come and visit with us all.

98
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:53,383
So plan B is in full effect, and it's a strong and welcome alternative.

99
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:58,245
All right, so please don't accuse us of a bait and switch.

100
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:05,367
I used to work at Lechmere back in the day, selling home electronics, and got accused of that fairly often.

101
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:07,068
But I digress.

102
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:16,334
And this conversation is actually one that my guest and I planned to have toward the end of 2022, but life got in the way.

103
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:28,901
So it's a great time to be appearing on this platform tonight with my friend and WMCC colleague, the executive director of this West Medford Community Center, Lisa M. Crossman.

104
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,801
So let me tell you a little bit about her.

105
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:39,323
Lisa is a dynamic advocate for community.

106
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:50,407
She has spent most of her adult working life connecting children, young adults, and older folks to resources, resiliency, and respect.

107
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:53,909
It's her passion, and she's really good at it.

108
00:14:54,843 --> 00:15:10,350
Starting as an energetic new WMCC board member in December of 2021, she was quickly recruited into the emergency role of interim executive director and hit the ground running.

109
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:20,502
installing new administrative systems, upgrading communications, and expanding the network of friends and supporters of this venerable neighborhood home.

110
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:26,311
Lisa quickly enhances stability, presence, and reputation of our organization.

111
00:15:27,132 --> 00:15:28,554
in Medford and beyond.

112
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:40,188
This professionalism and can-do attitude led the WMCC board to conclude that she was the right person for the job, and the interim tag was removed toward the end of 2022.

113
00:15:42,893 --> 00:16:01,529
As a coach, consultant, and nonprofit manager, Lisa has provided exceptional leadership for organizations like the Greater Boston YWCA, the Shriver Job Corps, the Malden Y, the Clark Memorial Y of Winchendon, Mass., and the Fitchburg Public Schools.

114
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:09,776
She has brought a wealth of tenacity, intelligence, common sense, and no nonsense to her work here in West Medford.

115
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:22,223
The mayor's office, longstanding Medford institutions, businesses, philanthropies, and political entities have taken notice and signed onto the program here at 111.

116
00:16:22,943 --> 00:16:29,827
Now my bishop at church is fond of saying that it's a sorry frog that doesn't praise his own pond.

117
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:37,192
So it's my distinct honor to welcome Lisa Crossman to the table of First Fridays at the WMCC.

118
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,887
Thank you, Terry, thank you.

119
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:47,437
So Lisa, thanks so much for being the first player off the bench and picking up the rock.

120
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:48,859
It's game time.

121
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:50,368
All right, let's go.

122
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:50,768
All right.

123
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:55,013
So we are still in the early hours of Black History Month for 2023.

124
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,377
I want to get us into a historic frame of mind.

125
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:03,062
I write a lot of poetry that speaks to legacy, mission, and vision.

126
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:07,407
As is my custom in hosting these evenings, I want to share a piece of verse.

127
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:09,790
This is called, I Came for the Stories.

128
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:24,946
I came for the stories of how you built this place, from the entrails, from the dregs, from the unwashed and the unwanted, the only piece of the city they'd let you have.

129
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:32,891
But you built it with pine and pegs and poles and persistence, with the beauty of duty and the substance of faith.

130
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:42,279
I came for the stories of the heroes and the unheralded, of the legacy makers and the territory takers and the boundary shakers and the barrier breakers.

131
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:49,544
The first ones to do the big thing, the bold thing, the forbidden, the unfamiliar, the courageous thing.

132
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:56,970
I came for the stories, the ones you save for your children and their children and their children.

133
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:09,965
Anansi's stories, Shaka Zulu's stories, Sheba's stories, Hannibal's stories, Toussaint's stories, Sojourner's stories, Malcolm, Marcus, Martin, and Medgar's stories.

134
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:15,687
Epic and tragic truth of how we came over and what we've overcome.

135
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:30,572
I came for the stories, all of them, lost, stolen, or strayed, because history can't be real for me, can't reveal to me, can't appeal to me without showing the black and the brown and the tan.

136
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:38,740
Whitewashing so clearly all critical race theory just tells me we are nearly erasing a past we will pay for dearly.

137
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:53,513
I came for the stories only poets can tell, magical tales that cast a spell, living water from the griot's well, distant drumming and a faraway bell, the sea's reply in a queen conch shell.

138
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:57,103
The salted air as the billows swell.

139
00:18:57,143 --> 00:19:00,144
An archangel triumphs as the demons fell.

140
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:04,666
Giants flee from where Davids dwell, lest they drown in a deepening still.

141
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:07,767
Legion is vanquished and sent back to hell.

142
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:10,348
The riot ends with a mournful yell.

143
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:13,750
The ode is recorded from Distik to Del.

144
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:34,903
I came for the stories and I will not leave as I am beseeching my beyond my own reaching for all you are teaching the sermons you're preaching where black knows no bleaching of the borders we're breaching as hatred is leeching and rage is screeching for loves impeaching.

145
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:37,104
I came for the stories.

146
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:39,546
I came for the stories.

147
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:42,408
I came for the stories.

148
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:50,904
So that's the lay of the land.

149
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,226
Let's have a friendly chat with Lisa Crossman.

150
00:19:55,246 --> 00:20:01,070
So Lisa, can you talk a bit about your history with this West Medford neighborhood?

151
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:02,643
OK.

152
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:08,987
First of all, I'm going to say it's really different to be on this side of the table.

153
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:16,212
But OK, so I have a good friend, my best friend, who is from West Medford and lived on Harvard Street.

154
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:19,173
And gosh, you could throw a rock right at her house.

155
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:21,335
And so she brought me out here.

156
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:22,435
We went to college together.

157
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:25,877
And she brought me out here for the basketball tournaments.

158
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:29,980
And that's where I was like, what is going on here?

159
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:36,707
It was just amazing to come here, to see all the people, everyone's so welcoming, having a good time.

160
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:42,473
And we were out late, and there was not one problem, not one problem.

161
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:49,140
And oftentimes, we would just sit at the house, walk the neighborhood, and she's like, we got to see who's out, we got to say hello to everybody.

162
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,321
They would be out on the porch.

163
00:20:51,162 --> 00:21:06,650
So, gosh, that was probably 20 years ago that I first came to know West Medford, and, you know, her family's like my family, and they have introduced me to other people, and that was my first connection, never knowing that I would ever... from Central Mass.

164
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:12,734
So, to think that I would ever be out in Boston, like, when you're in Central Mass, it's just a long shot, right?

165
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:15,815
That you're gonna come out to Boston and find success and working and all of that.

166
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:18,637
So, you know, 20 years later, here I am.

167
00:21:20,538 --> 00:21:23,939
the executive director of the community center.

168
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:25,779
It's just, you know, full circle.

169
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:26,099
Yeah.

170
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:26,419
Yeah.

171
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:26,759
Yeah.

172
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,240
OK, fantastic.

173
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,961
So what made you first decide to get involved with the community center?

174
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:35,101
Stephen Douglas.

175
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:45,244
Honestly, Stephen Douglas has if you're not familiar with Stephen, his family has had a long history with the center and giving to the center in some way, shape or form.

176
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:50,125
And he was sitting on the board at the time and had spoken to me kind of about

177
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:53,667
you know, there was some disruption and there was going to be changeover.

178
00:21:53,987 --> 00:21:55,808
And this was during the pandemic.

179
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,870
So I happened to not be working at the time.

180
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,291
And he said, you know, would you be interested?

181
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:01,952
And I said, absolutely.

182
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:04,293
Yeah, fantastic.

183
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:07,455
So you started out on the board.

184
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,056
I started out on the board.

185
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:09,517
Yes.

186
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:14,980
And then very quickly transitioned into the interim directorship.

187
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,130
Right.

188
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,874
We we had a change over that happened quite unexpectedly.

189
00:22:21,635 --> 00:22:30,242
And so, you know, it was a Friday when the last director left and a Monday when I was in place here, just like, you know, I'm going to step in.

190
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:35,506
I have the experience and we'll keep the doors open and we'll keep things running until we can figure out next steps.

191
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:36,287
OK, OK.

192
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:37,188
All right.

193
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:37,788
So.

194
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:43,152
Early on, you're here, you're sitting in the director's chair.

195
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:54,458
What might have given you pause or made you say, what the heck have I gotten myself into, particularly in the early months of your management?

196
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,540
Oh boy.

197
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:03,304
I can't say that it was that, it was kind of like,

198
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:15,290
I don't know, walking into one, what was a mystery, and two, kind of like it was, we were coming out of the pandemic and programming hadn't really been going on.

199
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,554
So it was like, you know, nobody's calling, no emails are coming through, no one's walking through the door.

200
00:23:21,895 --> 00:23:24,337
We're under a lot of stuff.

201
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:26,879
We had a lot of stuff here in different places.

202
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,504
And I could see kind of the mountains of things that had to be done that maybe got neglected for a while.

203
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:33,725
And so it was like, oh yeah,

204
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:41,224
When you get in the attic, and you open some closets, and you open the shed, and you're like, oh my gosh.

205
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:42,245
That's when I know.

206
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:43,186
I was like, oh, OK.

207
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:44,627
This is going to be some work.

208
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:45,828
This is going to be some work.

209
00:23:45,948 --> 00:23:46,789
Good, good.

210
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:47,229
OK.

211
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:48,110
All right.

212
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,112
So you're directing the WMCC.

213
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:57,197
And you can luxuriate over this, if you like.

214
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:05,922
What so far have you been taught about West Medford in the greater city of Medford?

215
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:13,486
I have been taught that a city can be very much like a town in that

216
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:24,236
You know, people can live very different lives, come from very different backgrounds, but yet they all share a common thread.

217
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:31,743
And I think that's one of the unique things about Medford is I have had the luxury to go to different spaces,

218
00:24:33,645 --> 00:24:40,847
in different groups and meetings and things like that, and talking to people, everyone's story is kind of the same.

219
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:56,411
You know, they grew up here, and maybe they're still in that family home, or they live near there, or they're dating someone they went to high school with, and they used to throw rocks over the fence at somebody, or whatever the mischief that they would get into is the same in both West Medford and Medford.

220
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:57,071
There's so many

221
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:58,412
similar stories.

222
00:24:58,432 --> 00:24:59,632
They love their families.

223
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:03,695
They love their town, their city, all the same.

224
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:13,241
And, you know, we just have that kind of divide or wall that's still there that we're looking to kind of peek over and see, hey, like we are a lot alike.

225
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,722
We are a lot of the same.

226
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:16,823
And like, how can we get together on this?

227
00:25:17,444 --> 00:25:17,744
I'm sorry.

228
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:19,125
I see my son in the corner.

229
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:21,827
He thinks this is the Grant show tonight.

230
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:22,867
So I told him.

231
00:25:29,817 --> 00:25:30,357
All right.

232
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:33,740
Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.

233
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:37,022
OK.

234
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:39,364
This is actually a first for us.

235
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:43,326
We usually don't have any grant sightings.

236
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:52,213
He usually goes on lockdown in the office, and he's got his computer and his games, and everything is all set.

237
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:53,814
But tonight, he's curious.

238
00:25:54,314 --> 00:25:57,400
And curiosity is a good thing for a seven-year-old?

239
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:57,921
Yes.

240
00:25:58,061 --> 00:25:58,842
A seven-year-old.

241
00:25:58,882 --> 00:25:59,684
Yeah, so good.

242
00:25:59,704 --> 00:26:05,314
And if I embarrass him enough, he'll end up back in the office with his laptop.

243
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:06,075
So it's all good.

244
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:06,756
It's all good.

245
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:13,988
Quick game, and we may play more than one, but I want to do a quick game of word association.

246
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:24,100
So I'll give you a word, and if you can shoot back at me what it suggests to you, and you can amplify it a little bit.

247
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,403
So first word, resiliency.

248
00:26:27,691 --> 00:26:28,511
tenacity.

249
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:32,612
I think we all are resilient.

250
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:39,074
Some of us have to be more resilient than others just based on our circumstances and how we came into the world.

251
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,254
But that's part of humanity.

252
00:26:42,854 --> 00:26:45,775
Every day we get up and we say, why are we doing this?

253
00:26:45,815 --> 00:26:47,636
Why are we going to work every day?

254
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:48,856
What are we doing?

255
00:26:49,696 --> 00:26:55,100
You know, we push through through the sickness, through the sadness, through the loss.

256
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:04,166
We all are resilient in, you know, all of us slap on a smile and keep going and and keep pushing and just hoping to get through the day.

257
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:04,446
But.

258
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:08,010
Yeah, tenacity would be the word.

259
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,631
I love that.

260
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:09,131
I love that.

261
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:14,498
I love especially that you mentioned, you know, we suffer losses.

262
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:22,127
I often say, and you know, folks here have heard me say it, one of the most difficult things of working, particularly in elder services, is

263
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:34,519
you know, that sense that you have, you know, sometimes a foreboding that you're going to lose, you know, somebody you come in and somebody that was there two days before is no longer with us.

264
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:40,504
So I think it's incumbent upon us in the roles that we both have

265
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:48,068
to be resiliency for folks that aren't necessarily feeling it themselves at any given time.

266
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:56,533
So I think that's what we both try to do here is keep the smile on our face and keep the jokes and keep it coming.

267
00:27:57,193 --> 00:27:58,854
You're doing a good job of that.

268
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,756
Okay, so word number two is equity.

269
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:08,490
I like to think of equity as, this is not a word, sorry.

270
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:15,117
Equity is like opening the door, it's a secret handshake, right?

271
00:28:15,297 --> 00:28:18,600
It's that pathway when you thought the door was closed, it's the key.

272
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,424
We have had so many opportunities here based on people sharing their equity.

273
00:28:28,744 --> 00:28:44,898
And I can't thank Melinda enough because she, Melinda Regan, our treasurer, who really gave us an opportunity that that line she opened for us has opened so many doors and opportunities and got us to meet people and understand how the inner workings of a lot of things.

274
00:28:44,998 --> 00:28:49,482
And I think that's just one of the smallest things that we can do.

275
00:28:49,582 --> 00:28:51,084
And as an executive director,

276
00:28:51,744 --> 00:28:54,830
or even a community person, I feel like that's my role.

277
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:03,746
I am privileged to a lot of knowledge, and so being able to teach someone and help them understand the channels, you know, that is equity where to share our knowledge.

278
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:06,075
Fantastic.

279
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:06,615
I like it.

280
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:07,235
I like it.

281
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:19,239
And I know this is subject to change in a shifting landscape, but what's your current vision for the West Medford Community Center?

282
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:19,859
Oh boy.

283
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,100
My current vision is

284
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,323
And goal, I would say, is financial freedom for the center.

285
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:30,245
I feel like the center deserves financial freedom.

286
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:35,208
We've been around since 1935, and we do have some heavy bills.

287
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:41,813
But once we are financially free, then we're removed from that grant space.

288
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:57,277
And what's tough about the grant space is that, you know, we are subject to the grant to maker, which is oftentimes the federal government and others, but, you know, they deem the language, they deem how we are to count our community, right?

289
00:29:57,477 --> 00:30:06,699
And I don't believe that's a way that we should approach business and community or nonprofit is to say, hey, you gotta count my numbers, you know, what's the race, what's the gender, what's the age?

290
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:10,940
So it would be nice to just do the work because we're doing the work.

291
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,441
So that is the vision.

292
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:26,207
The vision is to inject a teen space here and grow, connect our seniors to that and work on, you know, some garden space and connect community through that.

293
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:41,316
So that is the vision and going into the resiliency hub work, whether or not, you know, the city is funding a grant that pilot grant and whether or not we are able to get funded again.

294
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:43,297
We plan to continue that work.

295
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:48,300
We live in a floodplain over here, so we want to make sure our residents are prepared.

296
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,661
We feel like that's important work as well.

297
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:52,462
So that's the vision.

298
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:54,563
More keeps adding to the play.

299
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:56,824
I mean, it's keep it coming.

300
00:30:56,884 --> 00:30:57,525
Keep it coming.

301
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:02,467
So folks should know that you're a basketball lifer.

302
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,768
That's true.

303
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:03,868
OK?

304
00:31:03,888 --> 00:31:05,049
That's very true.

305
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:14,594
Playing and coaching, what has the game of basketball given you that you take into directing WMC activities and relationships?

306
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:15,194
Oh, wow.

307
00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:22,318
So I have been a coach, a ref, a player, and coached at the high school level.

308
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:31,211
gives me confidence to work, because it's a male-dominated space, number one.

309
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:50,556
And so it's given me the confidence to network, to lead, to know when to follow, to know when to pay attention, change plan, when I need to recruit more players, to get into the game, how to boost up the energy, and to map out long-term.

310
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,616
We just don't show up to a game and play.

311
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:55,317
We have a strategic plan of how we're going to win the game.

312
00:31:56,137 --> 00:32:01,641
And if you're a good coach, you have plan A through Z, because you just never know what's going to happen in the game.

313
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:03,382
And how to manage time.

314
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,884
Time is such an important factor in basketball.

315
00:32:05,944 --> 00:32:12,950
And the last 30 seconds of a game, a lot can be changed in those moments.

316
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:18,794
And so, yeah, it has done a lot for my life.

317
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,056
I know it's done a lot for many others, Brianna included.

318
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:25,738
Teamwork, learning to get along, right?

319
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:29,019
Finding no weaknesses, making sure you're building people up, all of that.

320
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,040
Okay, okay.

321
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,121
So back to Word Association.

322
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:35,382
Support.

323
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:38,748
A community.

324
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:40,609
Community would be the word for me.

325
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:44,810
I feel like I find a lot of support in community, especially being here.

326
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:50,953
And I feel like I try to find spaces where we can be supportive.

327
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:55,534
Yeah, there's days when it's just like, I don't have it.

328
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:56,655
I just don't have it.

329
00:32:56,795 --> 00:33:01,076
And then, you know, a senior will walk through the door and make some type of joke or make me laugh.

330
00:33:01,116 --> 00:33:01,737
And I'm like, all right.

331
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:06,662
Let's get into it or I'll get a call from someone from the city like Francis.

332
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,124
And she's got this idea.

333
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:09,406
And we're like, all right, let's go.

334
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,309
We like just change the whole forecast.

335
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:15,875
And it's just that's that's how I frame it.

336
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:17,637
Good, good, good stuff.

337
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:19,420
Communications.

338
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:27,849
I would say charge it to my head and not my heart.

339
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,753
One thing I'm getting buried in is emails, absolutely, positively.

340
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:37,457
So I prefer to pick up the phone and talk to people personally, show up to somebody's office.

341
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:40,279
So I prefer in-person communication.

342
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:43,942
I think it's so important, and we've lost that over the years.

343
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:47,205
20 years ago, we would be making an appointment to see somebody.

344
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,766
You'd pop in and say hello.

345
00:33:49,707 --> 00:33:51,249
And I've kind of missed those times.

346
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:53,131
I don't know if we can bring those back.

347
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:56,035
But I think communication is important.

348
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:57,817
I think we lack something in Zoom.

349
00:33:57,857 --> 00:34:01,221
You can't really tell someone's character or their energy through Zoom.

350
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:05,626
And I think being in person and communicating is really important.

351
00:34:05,646 --> 00:34:06,907
That's how we understand one another.

352
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,521
I was just wondering if that was the Caribbean calling me.

353
00:34:14,561 --> 00:34:17,963
Because I sure enough need to be there right now.

354
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:19,404
OK.

355
00:34:20,785 --> 00:34:28,450
So maybe I'm asking this a little bit too early, but I'm going to ask it anyways.

356
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:35,474
So what has been your favorite moment or few moments of being part of this family thus far?

357
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,709
Oh, man.

358
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,472
Summer basketball is definitely at the top of my list.

359
00:34:43,192 --> 00:34:44,894
Basketball is in my heart.

360
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:53,160
We have 40 girls in our league, which is kind of unheard of for basketball to have 40 girls get along and playing basketball together.

361
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:56,042
So that has been something.

362
00:34:57,423 --> 00:34:59,524
The senior group has been amazing.

363
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:10,546
That is another great moment for us, for me personally, and getting to know everybody, knowing the people on the walls and the stories.

364
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:19,608
You know, Buddy Clayton used to say to me, I used to say, good to see you, and he's like, good to be seen, right?

365
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:22,509
So things like that that just stick with me.

366
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:26,550
And definitely the events, MLK Day was a big one.

367
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,291
just to pull it off.

368
00:35:31,132 --> 00:35:41,177
So those have been some highlights, but there's not one down moment that I can speak of that I can sit here for the whole time and tell you, rip off a bunch of times that I've enjoyed.

369
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:43,918
Good, good, good.

370
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:51,682
So what new initiatives are you excited about for this coming, well, this program year that we're in right now?

371
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:56,384
So the Circles, the Resiliency Hub is the overarching.

372
00:35:56,924 --> 00:36:02,286
The Resiliency Hub work we'll be doing with the city and the partners in that group.

373
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:09,288
I'm looking forward to that and us coming together, finding a way to all work together and kind of close all the gaps.

374
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:14,350
And within that, we'll be doing some anti-poverty work with a program called Circles USA.

375
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,411
Will be the first chapter in Massachusetts, which is pretty exciting.

376
00:36:21,404 --> 00:36:22,985
Some teamwork, to be honest.

377
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:26,187
Teamwork is kind of in my wheelhouse.

378
00:36:26,247 --> 00:36:26,847
Near and dear.

379
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:28,668
It is very near and dear.

380
00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:41,935
And so, you know, looking to add more programming, maybe transform the space and open the space to our teens who are looking for, you know, some caring adults, some value to programming.

381
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:44,056
Okay, very good.

382
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,038
Okay, so here's another word.

383
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:48,419
Activism.

384
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,019
Oh boy.

385
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:56,444
Courage, I would say courage, right?

386
00:36:56,684 --> 00:37:00,166
It takes a lot to say, this is what I believe.

387
00:37:00,706 --> 00:37:04,467
This is what I see is right, and this is what I see is not right.

388
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:08,408
Justice, injustice, and to stand on that.

389
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:10,949
I think that's a tough space to be in.

390
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:17,352
You really got to know who you are and what you believe and know what your past is.

391
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,781
to do that.

392
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:24,104
And I think that, you know, a lot of people go, they don't go in it.

393
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:27,867
Most people don't go in it for the accolades, right?

394
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:30,529
The people who are in that for that space get that.

395
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:40,796
But there are so many others who are out there battling and just the voice in the wilderness, you know, up against the mountain, the pebble against the mountain.

396
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:44,659
But they do it anyways, and then admire that training quality.

397
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:45,820
So

398
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:58,968
space, in this physical space, and not feel that all the time.

399
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:16,798
Because there's so much around us that speaks to activism, that speaks to folks that saw a need for something, that speaks to Rudy Smith looking at the police department and saying, there needs to be black representation.

400
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:22,822
And toughing it out when his supervisor said to him, I don't even know what to do with you.

401
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:34,041
before he put him out on the street, and he gained a following and became one of the decorated officers in the police department.

402
00:38:34,422 --> 00:38:35,705
It's Buddy Clayton.

403
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:52,105
Booker and Evelyn Tyner opening that beauty shop and getting the sisters' heads together so they could go home and be beautiful for they hubbins.

404
00:38:54,127 --> 00:39:01,774
Even in a more contemporary way, it's a Henry Malorin being a champion for the city.

405
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:05,217
It's a Wally Counts being a champion for the city.

406
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:07,639
It's a Doc Counts.

407
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:17,386
just really chronicling what happened here, who we were, who we became, what we are capable of.

408
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:25,171
There's so much that really speaks to being active and engaged, so I love your description of that.

409
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:45,507
So as you're thinking about collaborations and youth development, you mentioned, and resiliency, community building, and what comes next, how will what you've learned thus far in your early tenure kind of inform those decisions, those deliberations?

410
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:47,408
On partnership?

411
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:54,614
Yeah, on, you know, on, yeah, collaborating and some of the program initiatives and some of the things that you really, really want to do.

412
00:39:57,587 --> 00:40:02,472
I think listening, the listening side of things, it's been really important.

413
00:40:03,412 --> 00:40:07,877
In my younger days, I would come in and be like, I see that this needs to change.

414
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:10,159
I'm going to change it.

415
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,020
I'm going to change that.

416
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,020
I'm going to change that.

417
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:17,144
did my due diligence to sit back and listen.

418
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:19,886
And if I saw a crash coming, I let it crash.

419
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:29,111
And we just saw our way through it and talked our way through it so that we're on board next time through.

420
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:32,073
So that would be a part of it.

421
00:40:32,093 --> 00:40:35,615
I have a better understanding of the landscape.

422
00:40:36,696 --> 00:40:42,500
And challenging some of the collaborators and partners to kind of look through my lens and just

423
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,502
see what I see, and let's have a conversation based around that.

424
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:59,847
I'm happy to say that maybe I was wrong, but I think sometimes when we're bogged down in the work and we're doing the work, we're so close to it, we don't often see how we're impacting.

425
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:02,729
others or what others might be feeling.

426
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:11,095
And so, you know, challenging people to kind of look through a different lens this time around and seeing where we can thread the needle.

427
00:41:11,195 --> 00:41:13,497
Honestly, there's a lot of people.

428
00:41:13,517 --> 00:41:15,058
The time moves so fast.

429
00:41:15,418 --> 00:41:16,599
Yeah, it's been a year.

430
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:21,443
Time moves so fast and we haven't even scratched the surface on collaboration and partnership.

431
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:22,825
Absolutely, absolutely.

432
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:27,231
There's so much out there.

433
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:36,424
I think you've seen just in the time that you've been doing the job, how many people have been kind of on the outside looking in

434
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:43,469
waiting for an invitation or waiting for some type of initiative that can kind of bring them to the table.

435
00:41:43,489 --> 00:41:53,815
And we've been really fortunate in that regard because a lot of the folks who are waiting, we've been able to kind of invite in and start to get that collaborative thing working well.

436
00:41:54,273 --> 00:42:06,796
Right, right, and, you know, to their credit, people have been kind of just waiting, kind of seeing what's going on, as they should, as they should, and, you know, feel comfortable enough to say, like, okay, let's give this a shot.

437
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:13,478
So we value those opportunities and giving us second and third chances, you know, to get it right.

438
00:42:13,718 --> 00:42:16,018
Yeah, second and third chances.

439
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:21,622
Okay, so it's a little bit more personal.

440
00:42:21,662 --> 00:42:24,085
You can take it wherever you would need to take it.

441
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:29,451
But what would people who are just meeting you be surprised to learn about you?

442
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:31,794
Oh boy.

443
00:42:32,415 --> 00:42:36,019
Oh gosh, this is going to get personal.

444
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:44,921
telling this story today, you would be surprised to know that I gave birth to Grant at home.

445
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:50,729
At home, it was planned for the hospital, but man, he shot right out at home.

446
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:10,811
Well, I figured at some point in time, either me or you was going to say something that was going to chase the boy into the hills.

447
00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:13,274
He knew his cue.

448
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:16,958
But no, no, but finish, that's fascinating.

449
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:22,784
Yeah, I just, the labor pains weren't what I, you know, had expected.

450
00:43:22,844 --> 00:43:25,607
You know, you hear a lot as a woman and not knowing, right?

451
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:31,454
And I guess I have a high tolerance for pain because, you know, my friend left to go

452
00:43:32,976 --> 00:43:50,598
bring her daughter somewhere and as soon as she shut the door she was gonna bring me to the hospital didn't he just start coming out and the door was locked so the ambulance couldn't get in and they were trying to break down the door and I called 9-1-1 and I was like I don't know what to do

453
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,467
It's so funny, but nature handled itself.

454
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,908
He shot right out and caught him in my hands.

455
00:43:58,808 --> 00:44:03,790
And so his birth certificate says the home address, which is a pretty cool thing that we have.

456
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,551
And I get to drive by the house and say, hey, this is where you were born.

457
00:44:06,571 --> 00:44:07,492
Wow.

458
00:44:09,552 --> 00:44:09,953
Wow.

459
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:10,513
Wow.

460
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:13,174
I have four brothers and sisters.

461
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:14,394
That didn't happen to none of us.

462
00:44:17,077 --> 00:44:21,319
We were hospital babies.

463
00:44:21,419 --> 00:44:22,379
That's fantastic.

464
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:24,160
That's fantastic.

465
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:31,722
So I want to flip the script, because obviously you and I, we work real closely together.

466
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:37,144
And I've spent a pretty significant amount of time kind of interviewing you.

467
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:39,365
I want to give you Turnabout is Fair Play.

468
00:44:40,565 --> 00:44:44,827
So what question or questions would you perhaps want to pose to me?

469
00:44:46,193 --> 00:44:50,216
Um, I would ask... Oh, see, I'm not prepared.

470
00:44:50,256 --> 00:44:52,818
This is one I wish I had preparation for.

471
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,940
This is a laundry list, of course.

472
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,120
Yeah, I know.

473
00:44:56,581 --> 00:44:58,462
This is how I get spontaneity, you know?

474
00:44:58,702 --> 00:44:59,503
I don't tell you anything.

475
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:08,149
I would say, what do you envision for West Medford as part of this arts and culture kind of boom that's happening in Medford?

476
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:10,311
Yeah, yeah.

477
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:11,912
I think there's a couple things.

478
00:45:12,432 --> 00:45:13,093
I certainly...

479
00:45:14,273 --> 00:45:33,327
And I'm grateful to the mayor and the leadership of the city for putting me in this position, but more things like, I can't necessarily say what's an analog, but more things like the poet laureateship.

480
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:42,751
You know, more things that suggest to people in a very deliberate and pointed way, art is important here.

481
00:45:43,191 --> 00:45:45,452
You know, culture is important here.

482
00:45:46,032 --> 00:45:53,996
And diversity within those two spaces, the art space and the culture space, is exceptionally important.

483
00:45:54,496 --> 00:45:56,577
And we're going to find ways to promote it.

484
00:45:56,657 --> 00:45:57,818
Now, I competed

485
00:45:58,698 --> 00:46:04,567
And I know several of the folks that I competed against to land the poet laureateship.

486
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:11,517
So I can say, proof positive, beyond a shadow of a doubt,

487
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,461
no favoritism, certainly no nepotism.

488
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:20,182
I wasn't related to anybody.

489
00:46:21,982 --> 00:46:33,986
So it was really, really what I deemed a fair and equitable competition, and any one of those people would have been worthy of doing it and might well do it in the future.

490
00:46:34,346 --> 00:46:35,886
So it's that thing.

491
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:41,828
It's making sure that everybody knows that within this art and culture space,

492
00:46:42,808 --> 00:46:59,719
Folks are going to be considered on the merits of their abilities, and as Dr. King said, not the color of their skin, but the content of their character, whether it's their artistic character, their cultural knowledge, their inspiredness, so to speak.

493
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:06,303
Folks are going to be considered because of what they bring to the table, and not because they're the same color as the tablecloth.

494
00:47:08,545 --> 00:47:11,427
So yeah, I think that's it.

495
00:47:11,907 --> 00:47:17,492
I want for art and culture in this city to be meaningful to everybody.

496
00:47:18,032 --> 00:47:24,017
Everybody goes to the museum, the historical society.

497
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:26,279
Everybody goes to the library.

498
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,404
Everybody goes to the new art center that's gonna open on Mystic Avenue.

499
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:37,228
Everybody feels welcome in all of those spaces because that's important.

500
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:52,325
And I think one of the things, and you and I have talked about this a lot, is how important it is for us to be kind of a repository of art and culture and that welcomeness.

501
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:58,212
This is the space that was charted by the African American community.

502
00:47:58,532 --> 00:47:59,832
make no mistake about it.

503
00:47:59,852 --> 00:48:02,633
When you come in here, you're going to see that history.

504
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:08,834
You can have a party in here, you're not covering up the pictures, you're not, you know, none of that's going to happen.

505
00:48:09,194 --> 00:48:21,077
You need to understand that this is a very important and integral element of what this community will continue to be despite whatever changes happen.

506
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:25,858
And change, like death and taxes, is a constant.

507
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,018
It's gonna happen.

508
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:40,061
But are we able to navigate that change being nice to people, being fair to people, being open to people, and non-exclusionary?

509
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:47,623
And I think the West Memphis community has been very, very patient and tolerant of change.

510
00:48:49,323 --> 00:48:54,925
Now, that's not to suggest that we don't sit around and talk about it and lament and beef a bit.

511
00:48:55,085 --> 00:48:56,225
We certainly do.

512
00:48:57,005 --> 00:49:04,988
But we do it in a way that doesn't suggest to people that if they come, they're going to get booted out.

513
00:49:05,048 --> 00:49:06,108
They're going to get kicked out.

514
00:49:06,288 --> 00:49:07,269
Absolutely right.

515
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:14,539
Yeah, this center, that's one of the great things about the center, and we are kind of one of the best kept secrets.

516
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:20,486
But unfortunately, people make up their minds about the center before they've even come here.

517
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,570
And I hear a lot of opinions about people who've never come here.

518
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:35,700
So that's the thing, you know, this year we're really about opening the doors, welcoming people, come see for yourself, come meet people and judge for yourself.

519
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:42,326
And just because you walk in this space and see black and brown people on the walls, it doesn't it doesn't make you any less.

520
00:49:42,386 --> 00:49:44,027
It doesn't make anyone any less.

521
00:49:45,689 --> 00:49:50,593
And, you know, if you walk in and you feel something and you feel something inside, you know,

522
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:53,634
then that's something, you know, we got to get to the core.

523
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:54,474
We got to talk about.

524
00:49:54,514 --> 00:49:55,975
We got to we got to work on that.

525
00:49:56,815 --> 00:50:02,917
So you feel comfortable here because, you know, this has always been and will always be a welcoming space.

526
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:03,577
Yeah.

527
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:04,757
Yeah.

528
00:50:04,897 --> 00:50:06,598
I I always feel like.

529
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:23,058
It's incumbent upon our community, this changing but still vital aspect of Medford, it's incumbent upon us to be provocative.

530
00:50:23,278 --> 00:50:26,883
We don't get to sit and not say anything.

531
00:50:27,964 --> 00:50:32,647
we have to speak our minds because if we don't, nobody else will.

532
00:50:32,747 --> 00:50:39,533
Nobody else speaks, traditionally no one else has spoken for the West Medford community, it's had to speak for itself.

533
00:50:40,153 --> 00:50:51,002
And we still have to, especially as all the changes occur around us, in order for people to know who we are and what we value, we have to speak for ourselves.

534
00:50:51,062 --> 00:50:51,863
And I think that's,

535
00:50:54,324 --> 00:50:59,528
The cut of your jib, so to speak, that's part of it.

536
00:51:00,689 --> 00:51:04,712
Issuing that challenge to people, you gotta speak on it.

537
00:51:05,392 --> 00:51:06,533
You gotta say something about it.

538
00:51:06,653 --> 00:51:10,896
If you think it's good, bad, or indifferent, you gotta say something about it.

539
00:51:10,977 --> 00:51:11,917
That's very true.

540
00:51:12,037 --> 00:51:12,918
That is very true.

541
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:16,923
One of the unique things about this center, it's a community center, right?

542
00:51:17,063 --> 00:51:18,565
It's a nonprofit.

543
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,087
It is not run by the city.

544
00:51:20,107 --> 00:51:21,809
This is not a city program.

545
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:26,075
And it is for the community to take care of ourselves.

546
00:51:26,535 --> 00:51:31,542
Regardless of who's saying that, that is what kind of is that mission of the community center.

547
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:38,147
you know, if you are in the Medford community, it is kind of up to you to help take care of that.

548
00:51:38,247 --> 00:51:57,702
And it just speaks to, you know, this higher notion of, you know, kind of letting it all go, letting the work go and letting the stress go and all those things go and and taking care of one another and making sure everyone is all right and checking in and and, you know, looking not to make see what's in someone else's bowl, but to make sure they have enough.

549
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:05,400
You know, we really need to get back to that kind of space and, you know, I'm not challenging anybody.

550
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,285
I'm just saying, I don't live here.

551
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,082
I live in Malden, you know what I mean?

552
00:52:10,102 --> 00:52:11,943
I don't have a vote here, I don't have anything here.

553
00:52:12,824 --> 00:52:24,255
My son and I, we give a lot of time here, and it's not our community, but we very much take it in as our own, and we would hope that others in Medford did the same, right?

554
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:27,778
Time, money, energy, effort, whatever you have to give, give a little.

555
00:52:29,038 --> 00:52:41,846
Yeah, and I'm going to challenge you in one way, and that is that when you say it's not your community, I would counter that.

556
00:52:41,886 --> 00:52:47,409
Because I think if you ask anyone of my seniors, they used to be my seniors,

557
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,572
You know, not in your seniors, you know.

558
00:52:51,032 --> 00:52:52,393
You own, I rent, you know.

559
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:58,039
But they will say she's one of us, you know, she's part of us.

560
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:08,208
And I think the comfort that they all feel with having you at the helm of the community center is really something that's pretty unparalleled to me.

561
00:53:09,009 --> 00:53:11,612
You know, we've got to go back a long ways

562
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:18,094
to be at a place where we could point to someone who's led the center and say, they get it.

563
00:53:18,955 --> 00:53:19,675
They really get it.

564
00:53:20,455 --> 00:53:22,256
Not to suggest that we haven't had folks.

565
00:53:22,316 --> 00:53:25,397
We've had great folks working in the community center.

566
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:32,760
But I think the consensus of the people that I talk to, my program folks, is that, well, she gets it.

567
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:39,983
So I don't feel bad when they bypass me on a fairly regular basis and go straight to your office, right?

568
00:53:41,924 --> 00:53:43,485
Isn't that kind of a senior thing?

569
00:53:43,885 --> 00:53:44,946
Shouldn't they be talking to me?

570
00:53:45,546 --> 00:53:59,456
But it just goes to show that a level of comfort has been achieved, which with several of your predecessors, I'm not going to name names, but folks know who I'm talking about.

571
00:54:00,577 --> 00:54:02,619
wasn't going to happen.

572
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:06,182
That level of comfort was never going to be achieved.

573
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:10,426
And again, we've had some great leadership, so I'm not trying to throw anybody under the bus.

574
00:54:11,107 --> 00:54:13,349
But if they miss the bus and the wheels roll over them.

575
00:54:14,812 --> 00:54:16,354
Yeah, they've been very gracious.

576
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:17,996
And my son goes to St.

577
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:18,497
Ray's.

578
00:54:19,058 --> 00:54:21,782
So every day I'm walking to go pick him up.

579
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:24,145
You know, we spend money here.

580
00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:29,532
We go to buy food and all that to the Walgreens, ride the train into Boston, all of that.

581
00:54:29,592 --> 00:54:31,415
So we're very much a part of the community.

582
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:32,415
Absolutely.

583
00:54:32,756 --> 00:54:37,318
Yeah, I mean, I, you know, it's no secret, I live out in Randolph.

584
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:48,324
I'm here several days a week to do the job, but I got people on Monument Street, my aunt's on Mystic River Road, right?

585
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:53,567
And running the part of the city that the mayor don't run.

586
00:54:53,587 --> 00:54:54,228
And so...

587
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:02,854
I've never felt that I didn't have a place in Medford.

588
00:55:03,454 --> 00:55:12,601
And I'm assuming that Medford didn't really feel that way either, or else, certainly, in terms of being a poet laureate, that never would have happened.

589
00:55:12,921 --> 00:55:15,663
They would have said, well, you don't even live in Medford.

590
00:55:15,903 --> 00:55:22,327
But clearly, they thought that I was adding enough value to where they could say, OK, cool.

591
00:55:23,648 --> 00:55:28,310
I have to say I've been in Malden for seven years and I don't feel connected.

592
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:33,171
I even worked at the Malden Y. I don't feel connected there, but I absolutely 100 percent feel connected here.

593
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:41,594
So, yeah, and that goes to speak on, you know, your community of Medford, you know, that I feel at home.

594
00:55:41,654 --> 00:55:42,755
My son feels at home.

595
00:55:42,775 --> 00:55:43,655
You know him.

596
00:55:43,855 --> 00:55:45,316
Everybody's kind to him.

597
00:55:45,356 --> 00:55:47,176
He says hello to people on the street.

598
00:55:47,276 --> 00:55:49,077
So, yeah, it speaks volumes.

599
00:55:49,297 --> 00:55:49,557
Yeah.

600
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:50,457
Very good.

601
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:51,258
Very good.

602
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:56,039
Well, it's been an illuminating time.

603
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:59,659
And obviously, we could do this for hours and hours.

604
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,760
And on some days, when it's quiet in here, you and I get into it.

605
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,761
And we talk a lot about all of this stuff.

606
00:56:07,181 --> 00:56:09,481
But I want to give you the last word.

607
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:12,782
We're going to switch up things in a little minute.

608
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:15,963
But what are your parting thoughts?

609
00:56:16,003 --> 00:56:17,643
What do you want folks to know?

610
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:25,381
Um, I would want folks to know what I would kind of say is, like, kind of, you know, wake up, Medford.

611
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:27,622
Wake up and get involved in your city.

612
00:56:27,642 --> 00:56:29,203
You have lots of opportunities.

613
00:56:29,263 --> 00:56:30,704
There's employment opportunities.

614
00:56:30,784 --> 00:56:32,425
There's commission opportunities.

615
00:56:33,006 --> 00:56:34,186
And you need to be involved.

616
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:35,927
You can go online.

617
00:56:35,947 --> 00:56:36,928
You can watch the Zooms.

618
00:56:36,948 --> 00:56:45,913
You have an opportunity to watch and evaluate for yourself in a way you've never been able to before, kind of like, I would almost say, like a job interview, right?

619
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:48,675
evaluate the people that are in these roles.

620
00:56:49,055 --> 00:57:00,903
You are giving up a lot to people that you don't know what's going on, the conversations that are had in their informing policy that is going to affect you and your neighbors and your children down the line.

621
00:57:01,444 --> 00:57:02,745
And it's important that

622
00:57:03,265 --> 00:57:04,545
you give some time.

623
00:57:04,665 --> 00:57:07,726
And if the times don't work, speak up and say something.

624
00:57:07,806 --> 00:57:09,346
The channels are there for you.

625
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:12,227
I have to give a lot of credit to Brianna.

626
00:57:12,267 --> 00:57:17,969
She's sat down, she's listened, and she's opening the lines of communication.

627
00:57:18,009 --> 00:57:20,369
She's putting those checks and balances in place.

628
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:23,730
And she answers all of her emails.

629
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:28,671
So, you know, there are no excuses that you need to wake up and get involved.

630
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:31,192
There are many positions open on commissions.

631
00:57:31,232 --> 00:57:32,172
There's lots of charter

632
00:57:32,652 --> 00:57:34,034
work that needs to be done.

633
00:57:34,194 --> 00:57:36,957
And we're not just talking about events and the showy stuff.

634
00:57:37,377 --> 00:57:39,339
We're talking about real policy work.

635
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:43,083
So I would say wake up Medford and get involved.

636
00:57:43,143 --> 00:57:48,048
And if you don't know, then ask somebody, call City Hall and find out.

637
00:57:48,409 --> 00:57:51,712
But we need to fill these positions with not two or three people or

638
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:54,971
the same people that have had the same opinions over the years.

639
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:57,834
It's time to inject some checks and balances.

640
00:57:57,914 --> 00:58:04,220
It's time to challenge some of the thoughts that are there and get the rest of the community involved.

641
00:58:05,821 --> 00:58:06,222
Excellent.

642
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:06,762
Excellent.

643
00:58:07,623 --> 00:58:07,903
Excellent.

644
00:58:09,648 --> 00:58:23,783
So I want to thank you for bringing your, and I use this word without any reservation, dynamic leadership, your energy and your tenacious engagement to the community and to the city.

645
00:58:25,331 --> 00:58:30,055
And thanks for being willing to come off the bench this evening to share your insights.

646
00:58:30,796 --> 00:58:36,881
And to everyone watching, thanks so much for your attentiveness and your interest in our discussion.

647
00:58:38,342 --> 00:58:42,506
Get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin.

648
00:58:43,046 --> 00:58:45,929
Right after we take a break, we're going to reset our stage.

649
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:51,254
I'm going to share some announcements, and then we'll get into the lyrical miracle.

650
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:52,535
Okay?

651
00:58:53,035 --> 00:58:53,636
All right.

652
00:58:53,716 --> 00:58:55,117
Thank you very much.

653
00:59:04,905 --> 00:59:05,885
Thank you.

654
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:16,134
Okay, yes, feel free to talk amongst yourselves.

655
00:59:16,674 --> 00:59:19,777
There's some snacks in the back if you're interested.

656
00:59:21,037 --> 00:59:22,839
Restrooms on the left-hand side.

657
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:46,113
I think.

658
01:00:07,928 --> 01:00:09,630
just leave it over here.

659
01:00:09,911 --> 01:00:13,595
And the other one is gonna be for Katani.

660
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:19,223
Okay, so we just need to get rid of the table, put her in front and center.

661
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:43,716
Thank you.

662
01:00:58,853 --> 01:01:02,455
I have a women's pickup this summer.

663
01:01:02,555 --> 01:01:03,816
Yeah, that's true.

664
01:01:32,129 --> 01:01:32,429
Thank you.

665
01:02:12,155 --> 01:02:15,638
Okay, so we're going to get right back into it.

666
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:24,197
So if I can get everybody to take their seats.

667
01:02:24,897 --> 01:02:25,838
Okay, so.

668
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:46,186

696
01:05:51,577 --> 01:06:01,061
Okay folks, now it's time to turn our attention to the lyrical miracle we've engaged for this evening's musical side of The Ledger.

697
01:06:01,933 --> 01:06:16,146
So tonight we go to two well-established and highly professional performers that have gained a huge local following and have also taken their wonderful talents well beyond Massachusetts in New England.

698
01:06:16,366 --> 01:06:18,168
It gives me great pleasure

699
01:06:18,487 --> 01:06:23,192
to introduce my friend and sister, Katani Sumner.

700
01:06:23,632 --> 01:06:38,587
Katani Sumner is currently an educator in the Newton Public Schools, as well as a sought-after speaker and singer-songwriter, well-known as the inspirational emcee for the gospel brunch at the original House of Blues on the Fenway,

701
01:06:39,067 --> 01:06:41,428
to Rave Gospel Brunch.

702
01:06:41,508 --> 01:06:45,530
She served in that role at the House of Blues Fenway to Rave Reviews.

703
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:54,875
Katani is currently a member of the House of Blues Schoolhouse Band, where she is the singer-narrator for the History of the Blues presentations.

704
01:06:55,355 --> 01:07:00,738
Katani's most recent project has been the creation of the Zebra Friends podcast.

705
01:07:01,298 --> 01:07:10,607
A friendly conversation and exchange of ideas between long-term friends who happen to be black and white, hence the zebra piece.

706
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:14,430
The podcast is available on Apple and Spotify.

707
01:07:15,091 --> 01:07:17,213
She is a vocalist.

708
01:07:18,858 --> 01:07:25,444
with an amazing repertoire and a great sense of lyrical style, as you will soon see and hear.

709
01:07:25,784 --> 01:07:27,326
Welcome to West Medford Katani.

710
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:39,476
And no less an accomplished and highly sought after musician, songwriter, composer, and arranger, let me also present Mark Copeland III.

711
01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:52,520
Mark is an associate professor of music at Berklee College and the founder and CEO of Microscope Music LLC.

712
01:07:52,620 --> 01:08:04,110
He's known throughout the New England region as a jazz master, an exceptional teacher, and an advocate for young musicians looking to establish their career in the business of music.

713
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:12,597
Mark is himself a Berklee trained musician whose abilities and exploits put him on the I want to play with him list.

714
01:08:13,287 --> 01:08:15,587
of many of the area's top professionals.

715
01:08:15,928 --> 01:08:20,869
Ladies and gentlemen, it may be cold outside, but it's about to heat up in this room.

716
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:24,969
Here's Katani Sumner and Mark Copeland.

717
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:28,210
Wow, thank you, thank you, thank you.

718
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:31,751
So let me say, it's an honor to be here.

719
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,171
I've never been in this building, never been in this space.

720
01:08:34,871 --> 01:08:36,512
And we were watching the live stream upstairs.

721
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:38,832
So Miss Lisa, we have some things in common.

722
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:39,692
I play ball.

723
01:08:39,732 --> 01:08:41,093
I used to coach basketball.

724
01:08:41,213 --> 01:08:42,313
I stopped at refereeing.

725
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:47,477
But I'm so honored to be here at the beginning of Black History Month.

726
01:08:47,717 --> 01:08:54,323
And can I just say, I am thrilled to see bodies in these chairs.

727
01:08:54,603 --> 01:08:57,726
I was praying for the best, but ready to prepare for the worst.

728
01:08:57,786 --> 01:08:59,067
I was going to sing to my husband.

729
01:08:59,087 --> 01:09:01,069
And I was like, it's OK.

730
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:04,031
And the cameraman, and we were just going to get our little thing going on.

731
01:09:04,051 --> 01:09:09,836
But you guys, we are going to make this worth your trek in the polar tundra, OK?

732
01:09:10,777 --> 01:09:12,258
So thank you so much for coming out.

733
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:14,839
And if it's okay with you, we're going to take like a little musical history tour.

734
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:15,559
Is that all right?

735
01:09:15,579 --> 01:09:16,900
I thought so.

736
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,741
And so I want you to feel free to chime in and jump in.

737
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:20,942
We might learn something.

738
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:27,145
So as the narrator at the House of Blues, now I actually worked at the original House of Blues, the blue house in Cambridge.

739
01:09:27,185 --> 01:09:28,526
Any of y'all ever gone to that one?

740
01:09:29,286 --> 01:09:29,886
Yes.

741
01:09:29,926 --> 01:09:31,547
Did you ever come to the gospel brunch?

742
01:09:32,227 --> 01:09:32,728
Yes.

743
01:09:32,788 --> 01:09:34,528
If it was a female, it was probably me.

744
01:09:34,568 --> 01:09:36,609
I used to have dreadlocks, honey, the gray.

745
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:37,490
It's a new look.

746
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:42,973
But that was me so most likely um, so it's been a blessing to do this.

747
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:53,738
I'm an educator I love it and I love engaging kids with music and things So we're gonna take a little history tour because I learned some things and I'm hoping we all learn some things tonight and enjoy the music as we go so

748
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:57,802
Yeah, Mark, we've been around the world, y'all, but it's good.

749
01:09:57,882 --> 01:10:01,166
New England, too, but we've been some places, especially Mark.

750
01:10:01,506 --> 01:10:08,014
So we're going to start off by thinking about, you know, enslaved Africans came here early, you know, 1500s, they documented in the 1600s.

751
01:10:08,074 --> 01:10:13,460
And what happened was when enslaved Africans first came here, the first music that they really

752
01:10:14,661 --> 01:10:24,808
shared or participated in what's called work songs or field hollers because, you know, that gave them some energy and camaraderie with the folks who were working the lines with them.

753
01:10:24,908 --> 01:10:28,910
And then after the field hollers, what came next really was spirituals.

754
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:31,452
So we're going to start off with a little spiritual.

755
01:10:34,768 --> 01:10:48,332
And this is one that has a multiple meaning because, you know, Wade in the Water, when enslaved people were escaping, you gave messages in the music because you weren't allowed to really talk to each other.

756
01:10:48,852 --> 01:10:51,473
So we had to use talking drums to give messages.

757
01:10:52,173 --> 01:10:54,354
And then they try to take away the drums.

758
01:10:54,454 --> 01:10:58,135
So we're like, OK, well, we can make rhythm with whatever we got.

759
01:10:58,955 --> 01:11:01,156
But the song is Wade in the Water.

760
01:11:01,236 --> 01:11:03,217
And I'm going to try to stay cute without my glasses.

761
01:11:04,597 --> 01:11:07,500
Last Tuesday, I turned 60, so I might just keep it 100 if I need to.

762
01:11:07,561 --> 01:11:11,205
If I need to, just trust me.

763
01:11:11,905 --> 01:11:16,651
But anyway, so the song goes a little like this, and there's a message in the music.

764
01:11:16,671 --> 01:11:21,716
It said, wait in the water.

765
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:30,171
Wait in the water, children, wait in the water.

766
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:34,435
God's going to trouble the water.

767
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:38,399
See that host all dressed in white?

768
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:42,082
God's going to trouble the water.

769
01:11:42,522 --> 01:11:46,446
The leader looks like the Israelite.

770
01:11:46,826 --> 01:11:49,248
God's going to trouble the water.

771
01:11:50,429 --> 01:11:53,292
Wait in the water.

772
01:11:53,312 --> 01:11:54,313
You can sing if you want to.

773
01:11:54,653 --> 01:11:58,056
Wait in the water, children.

774
01:11:58,136 --> 01:12:01,379
Wait in the water.

775
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:04,943
God's going to trouble the water.

776
01:12:06,108 --> 01:12:20,480
see that band all dressed in red God's gonna trouble the water it looks like the band that Moses led God's gonna trouble the world if you know it sing it come on

777
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:22,778

Y'

815
01:12:52,772 --> 01:12:59,480
If you don't believe I've been redeemed, God's gonna trouble.

816
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:17,060
Just follow me down to the Jordan stream.

817
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,442
God's gonna trouble.

818
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:20,064
All right, big finish, everybody.

819
01:13:20,144 --> 01:13:20,505
Let's sing.

820
01:13:20,785 --> 01:13:23,669
Wade in the water.

821
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:27,914
Wade in the water, children.

822
01:13:28,014 --> 01:13:30,777
Wade in the water.

823
01:13:31,598 --> 01:13:34,379
God's gonna trouble the water.

824
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,919
I said God's gonna trouble.

825
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:38,859
Keep on moving.

826
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:40,520
God's gonna trouble.

827
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,480
Keep on believing.

828
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,940
God's gonna trouble.

829
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:52,262
Don't give up because God's gonna trouble the water.

830
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:54,462
Yeah.

831
01:13:54,502 --> 01:13:54,762
Yes.

832
01:13:59,137 --> 01:14:07,502
So one of the things we have to, we tell young people and they don't want to believe it, but all the American music forms originated from the blues, to keep it real.

833
01:14:08,122 --> 01:14:14,105
Like we didn't deal with classical, but country, all of that came out of a foundation of the blues.

834
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:20,348
And so, you know, we went from spirituals and we have the blues.

835
01:14:20,468 --> 01:14:22,950
And now the blues originated in the deep South around the 1890s, 1860s.

836
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:23,350
Okay, here we go.

837
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:28,261
It's early.

838
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:29,122
I had to go early.

839
01:14:29,142 --> 01:14:29,982
I know.

840
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:38,947
So we incorporated spirituals, and work songs, and field hollers, and shouts, and chants, and rhymes, simple narratives from the African-American culture.

841
01:14:40,067 --> 01:14:44,890
Now there are many different types of blues, including country blues, delta blues, and classic blues.

842
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:51,392
which usually featured women out in front of bands such as Legends, Ma Rainey, and Bessie Smith.

843
01:14:51,432 --> 01:14:58,895
And they were the first real recorded artists to really, their music went national because music started being charted and recorded.

844
01:14:58,955 --> 01:15:04,658
And so we're going to do this classic blues song called Backwater Blues.

845
01:15:05,318 --> 01:15:08,779
And this song was really about the, it was written in 1927, released in 1927.

846
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:13,463
in response to the Great Mississippi Flood.

847
01:15:13,503 --> 01:15:14,444
Anybody ever heard of that?

848
01:15:14,484 --> 01:15:15,525
The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927?

849
01:15:15,605 --> 01:15:16,486
Just one?

850
01:15:17,648 --> 01:15:18,369
Well, here we go.

851
01:15:18,429 --> 01:15:19,390
Can y'all hear me okay?

852
01:15:20,051 --> 01:15:21,472
We're gonna learn some things tonight.

853
01:15:21,532 --> 01:15:22,053
You heard of this?

854
01:15:22,133 --> 01:15:22,914
Okay, listen.

855
01:15:23,455 --> 01:15:24,416
This was terrible.

856
01:15:24,716 --> 01:15:30,002
So in 1927, it was the most destructive river flood in the history of the U.S.

857
01:15:31,003 --> 01:15:36,405
27,000 square miles were depths of up to 30 feet over a course of several months.

858
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:38,265
So this was bad.

859
01:15:38,665 --> 01:15:40,226
And approximately 500 people died.

860
01:15:40,306 --> 01:15:42,746
I'm surprised more people didn't die, but maybe there weren't that many living.

861
01:15:42,886 --> 01:15:43,266
I don't know.

862
01:15:43,366 --> 01:15:49,188
But anyway, this was Bessie Smith, and this is Backwater Blues.

863
01:15:50,368 --> 01:15:52,589
And y'all are so good, I might give y'all some choreography.

864
01:15:52,629 --> 01:15:52,969
Here we go.

865
01:15:54,221 --> 01:16:01,607
When it rained five days and the skies turned dark as night, yeah.

866
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:12,496
When it rained five days and the skies turned dark as night, yeah.

867
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:21,223
There's trouble taking place in the lowlands at night.

868
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:32,129
I woke up this morning, can't even get out of my door, no, no.

869
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:41,318
I woke up this morning, can't even get out of my door, no, no.

870
01:16:42,892 --> 01:16:49,716
There's enough trouble to make a poor girl wonder where she wanna go.

871
01:16:50,056 --> 01:16:51,977
Can I put your hands up and be my thunder and lightning?

872
01:16:52,597 --> 01:16:59,061
When it thunders and lightning and the winds begin to blow.

873
01:16:59,201 --> 01:17:00,061
Come on, thunder.

874
01:17:00,841 --> 01:17:01,822
Come on, lightning.

875
01:17:02,182 --> 01:17:09,026
When it thunders and lightning and the winds begin to blow, yeah.

876
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:17,494
There's thousands of people and ain't got no place to go.

877
01:17:17,615 --> 01:17:18,816
Now, can y'all clap your rhythm?

878
01:17:18,856 --> 01:17:19,197
Here we go.

879
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:19,557
Try this.

880
01:17:21,059 --> 01:17:26,946
Backwater blues, don't call me to pack my things and go.

881
01:17:27,567 --> 01:17:28,047
Yeah.

882
01:17:30,963 --> 01:17:53,701
♪ Blackwater blues, don't call me to pack my things and go, yeah ♪ ♪ Cause my house fell down and I can't live there no more, no more ♪ Yeah.

883
01:18:00,257 --> 01:18:18,897
listen again i'm grateful to be here this is the first time i've been able to sing in a little while because these little viral things that are going around the ones that ain't covet they can kick you just as hard y'all know that right and they hold on for a long time so stay well stay well vitamin c all the good stuff you need to do um so this is that was the blues

884
01:18:20,352 --> 01:18:25,194
And now you know right after the blues, and even at the same time as the blues, jazz.

885
01:18:25,294 --> 01:18:26,495
Any of y'all jazz fans?

886
01:18:26,895 --> 01:18:28,256
I know, I know, right?

887
01:18:29,356 --> 01:18:37,980
So now jazz, it's a type of music of African-American origin, of course, characterized by improvisation, syncopation, and usually a regular or forceful rhythm.

888
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,180
Excuse me.

889
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:43,342
Instrumentation is often brass, woodwind instruments, and piano.

890
01:18:43,662 --> 01:18:48,945
And a standard rhythm section would often be comprised of keyboards, a bass, and some drums.

891
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:53,606
So we thought y'all might appreciate this little ditty by Duke Ellington.

892
01:18:54,086 --> 01:18:59,788
And you might have heard it with one of my favorite singers of all time that I did not even hear about till I went to college.

893
01:18:59,808 --> 01:19:01,668
A little lady named Ella Fitzgerald.

894
01:19:01,688 --> 01:19:02,249
Y'all remember her?

895
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:03,709
All right.

896
01:19:03,869 --> 01:19:10,531
So y'all so good, if you want to jump right in, you just... And y'all are going to get to hear Mr. Copeland, the maestro, kill up on this piano, all right?

897
01:19:13,672 --> 01:19:16,773
It's called a dominant thing if it ain't got that swing, if y'all ain't figured out yet.

898
01:19:17,033 --> 01:19:17,593
All right, here we go.

899
01:19:20,303 --> 01:19:25,588
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing.

900
01:19:25,608 --> 01:19:30,292
Do-wop, do-wop, do-wop, do-wop, do-wop, do-wop, do-wop.

901
01:19:30,873 --> 01:19:32,895
It don't mean a thing.

902
01:19:33,415 --> 01:19:36,158
All you gotta do is sing.

903
01:19:36,178 --> 01:19:40,922
Do-wop, do-wop, do-wop, do-wop, do-wop, do-wop, do-wop, do-wop.

904
01:19:41,403 --> 01:19:45,406
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot.

905
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:50,790
I just give that rhythm everything you've got.

906
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:57,335
I dip it out and do it, don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing.

907
01:19:57,815 --> 01:20:02,458
Do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I.

908
01:20:16,418 --> 01:20:17,238
Yeah.

909
01:20:44,313 --> 01:20:49,558
It don't mean a thing, give it up for Mark, if it ain't got that swing.

910
01:20:50,118 --> 01:21:00,126
Do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I. It don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is sing.

911
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:10,135
Do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I. It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot.

912
01:21:10,655 --> 01:21:16,498
Just give that rhythm everything you've got.

913
01:21:16,858 --> 01:21:21,380
I mean a thing if it ain't got that swing.

914
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:26,582
Do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, yeah.

915
01:21:26,602 --> 01:21:31,964
Do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, one more time.

916
01:21:32,365 --> 01:21:39,908
Do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I, do I. Yeah.

917
01:21:41,741 --> 01:21:41,821
Woo!

918
01:21:43,463 --> 01:21:43,983
Woo!

919
01:21:45,584 --> 01:21:46,665
You have no idea.

920
01:21:46,725 --> 01:21:47,825
I'm so excited.

921
01:21:47,845 --> 01:21:50,387
I really thought it was going to be me and my husband.

922
01:21:52,168 --> 01:21:54,549
Y'all are not only here, but you are singing.

923
01:21:54,569 --> 01:21:55,589
Y'all are vibing.

924
01:21:55,609 --> 01:21:56,490
This is going to be fun.

925
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:57,711
Let's keep it going.

926
01:21:58,071 --> 01:21:58,331
OK.

927
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:02,593
So of course, there's spirituals, there's blues, there's jazz.

928
01:22:02,633 --> 01:22:07,736
And at the same time, what was happening was gospel was kicking it in the background.

929
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:10,577
Because gospel is really just spirituals and blues put together.

930
01:22:10,617 --> 01:22:11,338
How many of y'all know that?

931
01:22:12,038 --> 01:22:30,165
because the father of gospel music his name was Thomas A Dorsey and he was a jammer in the blues okay but his he got his heart broken his wife and his child died in childbirth and this song that he wrote was actually as a response to his extreme heartbreak but it became known as one of the like like

932
01:22:30,885 --> 01:22:32,826
I feel like it's the funeral song now.

933
01:22:33,506 --> 01:22:36,587
And this was one of Dr. King's favorite songs.

934
01:22:37,268 --> 01:22:40,509
In fact, Mahalia Jackson sang it at his funeral.

935
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,130
Anybody know what song this is?

936
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:42,430
Come on.

937
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:44,271
Talk back to me.

938
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:46,051
Y'all don't know, really?

939
01:22:46,452 --> 01:22:47,732
We just learning a lot here.

940
01:22:47,832 --> 01:22:48,693
Text in the mail, huh?

941
01:22:49,213 --> 01:22:49,493
Say it.

942
01:22:51,594 --> 01:22:52,674
Mahalia Jackson sang it.

943
01:22:54,015 --> 01:22:56,156
That's one of her major ones.

944
01:22:56,176 --> 01:22:57,056
Yeah, but no, y'all.

945
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:58,797
Precious Lord.

946
01:22:59,965 --> 01:23:05,047
Precious Lord, take my hand.

947
01:23:22,972 --> 01:23:44,792
lead me on let me stand I'm tired I'm weak

948
01:23:45,988 --> 01:24:01,538
And I'm worn through the storm, through the night.

949
01:24:05,489 --> 01:24:15,475
lead me on to the light.

950
01:24:16,476 --> 01:24:26,763
Take my hand.

951
01:24:28,304 --> 01:24:39,525
Precious Lord, and lead

952
01:24:47,566 --> 01:24:48,646
Yeah, we're going to stop there.

953
01:24:48,966 --> 01:24:49,906
Because I don't want to start.

954
01:24:51,227 --> 01:24:51,707
Yeah.

955
01:24:52,327 --> 01:24:53,307
Yes, Lord.

956
01:24:54,167 --> 01:24:56,288
Yes.

957
01:24:56,368 --> 01:24:58,208
So Precious Lord actually came out in 1932.

958
01:24:59,548 --> 01:25:01,769
So that was right around the Harlem Renaissance.

959
01:25:01,789 --> 01:25:02,929
That was right around that time.

960
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:06,510
And this is one of my favorite.

961
01:25:08,075 --> 01:25:30,826
jazz standards but I did a little research and this was written by Billie Holiday and it was funny because she wrote it in response to asking her mother for some money or something like that knowing that she had supplied a lot of what her mother had her mother was like I ain't giving you nothing and she said well God bless the child that's got his own I said you know what that sounds like a good uh lyric to a song and it goes like this

962
01:25:32,234 --> 01:25:35,158
Them that's got shall have.

963
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,942
Them that's not shall lose.

964
01:25:41,052 --> 01:26:06,129
So the Bible says, and it still isn't news, said your mama may have and your papa may have, but God bless the child who's got his own, who's got his own.

965
01:26:09,614 --> 01:26:16,028
Well, the strong gets more while the weak ones fade.

966
01:26:19,429 --> 01:26:26,434
Empty pockets don't ever make the grave.

967
01:26:26,995 --> 01:26:43,107
Said your mama may have, papa may have it too, but God bless the child who's got her own, who's got her own.

968
01:26:49,034 --> 01:27:02,171
Money, you've got lots of friends hanging around your door.

969
01:27:03,453 --> 01:27:15,985
But when it's gone and your spending ends, they don't come around, ain't gonna come around, don't seem to know you no more.

970
01:27:16,825 --> 01:27:23,392
Rich relations, they're going to give a crust of bread and such.

971
01:27:25,093 --> 01:27:31,695
You can help yourself, but you better not take too much.

972
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:45,299
Said your mama may have, and your papa may have, but God bless the child who's got his own.

973
01:27:45,839 --> 01:27:51,041
God bless the child who's got her own.

974
01:27:52,943 --> 01:27:58,368
God bless the child who's got his own.

975
01:27:59,088 --> 01:28:02,151
Who's got his own.

976
01:28:02,171 --> 01:28:02,492
Yeah.

977
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:18,512
Thank you so much.

978
01:28:18,992 --> 01:28:25,999
So this next song is a gospel song technically, but it was written originally as a children's song back in 1933.

979
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,462
But it became a civil rights song.

980
01:28:29,022 --> 01:28:33,446
It came to be, I think, first came into prominence sung by Sam Cooke, believe it or not, in 1964.

981
01:28:35,068 --> 01:28:46,037
And this is like one of my anthems, because my mission, I say that I want to be light and provide love and laughter through music, education, and care.

982
01:28:46,518 --> 01:28:48,019
But anyway, I believe we are all light.

983
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,581
And so you can sing this with a two-year-old.

984
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:52,643
You can sing this with a 102-year-old.

985
01:28:52,923 --> 01:28:55,666
And for me, it still has significance, because we are all a light.

986
01:28:56,146 --> 01:28:57,507
Some might be a little flashlight.

987
01:28:57,527 --> 01:28:58,989
Some might be a high beam light.

988
01:28:59,029 --> 01:28:59,970
Some might be a whatever.

989
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:03,831
We're gonna have to give it a, so we can, let's see, what beat can we give this?

990
01:29:03,931 --> 01:29:06,191
I wish my husband could play something for me.

991
01:29:06,452 --> 01:29:07,512
Pull out the tambourine, honey.

992
01:29:07,532 --> 01:29:08,512
All right, here we go.

993
01:29:08,812 --> 01:29:10,153
So here's a little rhythm lesson.

994
01:29:10,933 --> 01:29:12,053
It's on the two and the four.

995
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:16,814
So if you're rhythmically challenged, I still love you, but I'm gonna help you out, okay?

996
01:29:17,374 --> 01:29:19,935
So you're gonna tap your foot on the one and clap on the two.

997
01:29:20,035 --> 01:29:20,815
Here we go, try this.

998
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:22,556
You're gonna go stomp, clap.

999
01:29:24,017 --> 01:29:24,578
There we go.

1000
01:29:24,618 --> 01:29:24,818
Come on.

1001
01:29:24,838 --> 01:29:25,539
Stomp, clap.

1002
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:26,160
You got it.

1003
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,181
Come on.

1004
01:29:27,681 --> 01:29:28,422
Stomp, clap.

1005
01:29:28,442 --> 01:29:29,143
Stomp, clap.

1006
01:29:29,924 --> 01:29:31,226
If y'all can try to hang in there with that.

1007
01:29:31,266 --> 01:29:31,686
Thank you, honey.

1008
01:29:31,706 --> 01:29:32,047
Here we go.

1009
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:35,591
This little light of mine.

1010
01:29:35,651 --> 01:29:36,391
Come on and sing.

1011
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:37,652
I'm going to let it.

1012
01:29:38,192 --> 01:29:39,373
This little light.

1013
01:29:39,413 --> 01:29:40,673
This little light of mine.

1014
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:42,234
Sing it like you mean it.

1015
01:29:42,514 --> 01:29:44,055
I'm going to let it shine.

1016
01:29:44,395 --> 01:29:45,836
This little light.

1017
01:29:46,896 --> 01:29:48,197
I'm going to let it.

1018
01:29:48,357 --> 01:29:49,938
I'm going to let it shine.

1019
01:29:50,398 --> 01:29:51,859
Let it shine.

1020
01:29:51,899 --> 01:29:53,679
Let it shine.

1021
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,320
Come on, everybody.

1022
01:29:55,340 --> 01:30:01,103
Sing, everywhere that I go, everywhere I go, I'm going to let it shine.

1023
01:30:02,165 --> 01:30:07,707
Everywhere I'm gonna, I'm gonna let it shine.

1024
01:30:08,167 --> 01:30:13,349
Oh, everywhere I go, I'm gonna, I'm gonna let it shine.

1025
01:30:13,849 --> 01:30:15,270
Let it shine.

1026
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:16,710
Let it shine.

1027
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:17,470
Let it shine.

1028
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:18,511
Let's do one more verse.

1029
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:19,891
You can't blow it up.

1030
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:21,872
You can't blow it up.

1031
01:30:21,952 --> 01:30:22,592
I made this up.

1032
01:30:22,672 --> 01:30:24,893
I'm gonna, I'm gonna let it shine.

1033
01:30:24,953 --> 01:30:26,154
You can't blow it up.

1034
01:30:26,214 --> 01:30:27,954
You can't blow it up.

1035
01:30:28,434 --> 01:30:29,855
I'm gonna, I'm gonna.

1036
01:30:30,615 --> 01:30:31,956
You can't blow it.

1037
01:30:32,096 --> 01:30:33,317
You can't blow it.

1038
01:30:33,937 --> 01:30:34,918
I'm going to let it.

1039
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:36,198
I'm going to let it.

1040
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:36,819
Let's finish up.

1041
01:30:37,239 --> 01:30:38,640
Let it shine.

1042
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:40,081
Let it shine.

1043
01:30:40,121 --> 01:30:40,861
Let it shine.

1044
01:30:41,161 --> 01:30:43,003
Sing let it shine.

1045
01:30:43,043 --> 01:30:44,223
Let it shine.

1046
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:48,466
One more time.

1047
01:30:48,766 --> 01:30:50,407
Let it shine.

1048
01:30:50,447 --> 01:30:52,468
Let it shine.

1049
01:30:52,508 --> 01:30:55,490
Let it shine.

1050
01:30:57,907 --> 01:31:01,888
Let it shine.

1051
01:31:01,948 --> 01:31:14,790
All right, here comes another little history lesson.

1052
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:15,730
Let's see if y'all know it.

1053
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,771
I was going to bring candy and give it out, but I was like, ain't nobody going to want no candy.

1054
01:31:19,051 --> 01:31:20,011
But anyway, here you are.

1055
01:31:21,131 --> 01:31:21,872
Again, I'm so excited.

1056
01:31:25,431 --> 01:31:30,573
This is a song that was first actually written by this amazing Black woman.

1057
01:31:31,314 --> 01:31:33,555
But you know how it happened back in the day.

1058
01:31:33,975 --> 01:31:35,556
Black people write an amazing song.

1059
01:31:36,076 --> 01:31:39,697
And then somebody not Black decides that, ooh, I'd be liking that.

1060
01:31:40,138 --> 01:31:41,558
And so they're like, let me do this.

1061
01:31:41,738 --> 01:31:42,759
And then everybody going to like it.

1062
01:31:42,799 --> 01:31:43,819
And I'm going to make a lot of money.

1063
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,360
And we never seem to remember who the other person was.

1064
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:49,122
So I'm going to sing it by the first person.

1065
01:31:49,142 --> 01:31:50,262
And I won't even tell you who it is.

1066
01:31:50,302 --> 01:31:52,643
And I'm going to ask y'all to tell me who it was, see if you know it, all right?

1067
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:53,764
Here we go.

1068
01:31:56,343 --> 01:32:01,407
You ain't nothing but a hound dog, been snooping around my door.

1069
01:32:02,788 --> 01:32:07,892
You ain't nothing but a hound dog, been snooping around my door.

1070
01:32:10,134 --> 01:32:15,078
You can wag your tail, but I ain't going to feed you no more.

1071
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:18,181
You told me you were high class.

1072
01:32:19,677 --> 01:32:21,418
I could see through that.

1073
01:32:22,339 --> 01:32:27,462
Yes, you told me you were high class, but I could see you through that.

1074
01:32:29,703 --> 01:32:35,107
And daddy, I know you ain't no real cool cat.

1075
01:32:35,147 --> 01:32:38,028
You ain't nothing but a hound dog.

1076
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:40,170
I've been snooping around the door.

1077
01:32:41,571 --> 01:32:44,412
You're just an old nasty hound dog.

1078
01:32:44,533 --> 01:32:46,394
I've been snooping around my door.

1079
01:32:48,783 --> 01:32:54,265
So you can wag your tail, but I ain't gonna feed you no more.

1080
01:32:54,525 --> 01:32:55,506
Get on out of here.

1081
01:32:55,526 --> 01:32:59,067
All right.

1082
01:32:59,687 --> 01:33:00,228
Who knows?

1083
01:33:00,248 --> 01:33:01,188
Million dollar question.

1084
01:33:01,228 --> 01:33:01,768
Who was that?

1085
01:33:03,729 --> 01:33:04,309
No.

1086
01:33:04,589 --> 01:33:06,430
That might have been somebody in this century that did it.

1087
01:33:06,770 --> 01:33:07,991
But the first person.

1088
01:33:08,111 --> 01:33:09,371
Yeah, go say that.

1089
01:33:09,431 --> 01:33:09,651
Right.

1090
01:33:10,712 --> 01:33:11,672
Big Mama Thornton.

1091
01:33:13,173 --> 01:33:14,513
Yes, yes.

1092
01:33:14,573 --> 01:33:15,674
You get to have some snacks.

1093
01:33:15,714 --> 01:33:16,194
They're right in there.

1094
01:33:18,386 --> 01:33:20,086
Just for you, that's okay.

1095
01:33:20,466 --> 01:33:22,947
Even if you cheated, listen, you got the right answer.

1096
01:33:23,287 --> 01:33:25,888
So it's, yes, it's all good.

1097
01:33:26,248 --> 01:33:28,068
But this might be the version y'all recognize.

1098
01:33:28,088 --> 01:33:28,728
Remember this one?

1099
01:33:31,709 --> 01:33:36,350
You ain't nothing but a hound dog, crying all the time.

1100
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:42,251
You ain't nothing but a hound dog, crying all the time.

1101
01:33:43,769 --> 01:33:48,173
Well, you ain't never in a rabbit hole, ain't no friend of mine.

1102
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:48,974
That's enough of him.

1103
01:33:48,994 --> 01:33:50,295
All right.

1104
01:33:51,256 --> 01:33:51,997
Black History Month.

1105
01:33:53,178 --> 01:33:54,079
Y'all know who that was.

1106
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:55,640
But you know what?

1107
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:56,981
I saw the movie.

1108
01:33:57,462 --> 01:33:58,583
He grew up around a lot of black folks.

1109
01:33:58,623 --> 01:33:59,724
No wonder he sounded black.

1110
01:33:59,784 --> 01:34:00,585
Y'all see that movie?

1111
01:34:00,725 --> 01:34:02,186
I was like, oh, that makes sense.

1112
01:34:02,546 --> 01:34:04,448
He was all shouting at church and everything.

1113
01:34:05,089 --> 01:34:06,090
Would you say he was really black?

1114
01:34:07,138 --> 01:34:07,818
Oh, he thought he was.

1115
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:08,239
Oh, OK.

1116
01:34:08,659 --> 01:34:09,179
I was like, woo.

1117
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:12,161
I was like, woo, somebody got some tea up in here about Elvis.

1118
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:13,481
I didn't know that one.

1119
01:34:13,802 --> 01:34:15,442
All right, so we're going to move a little bit forward.

1120
01:34:15,482 --> 01:34:17,784
But what'd you say?

1121
01:34:17,804 --> 01:34:18,944
I love this.

1122
01:34:18,964 --> 01:34:19,585
It's just like my class.

1123
01:34:19,605 --> 01:34:20,285
It's like class, you know?

1124
01:34:20,305 --> 01:34:20,785
Yeah, that's right.

1125
01:34:20,825 --> 01:34:21,346
Interactive.

1126
01:34:21,366 --> 01:34:22,706
You know, whoever talks the most learns the most.

1127
01:34:22,986 --> 01:34:24,347
So I want to hear y'all.

1128
01:34:25,508 --> 01:34:26,668
So we move up through.

1129
01:34:28,988 --> 01:34:29,848
All right, so let me see.

1130
01:34:30,288 --> 01:34:33,629
So next coming up was kind of like what's called R&B.

1131
01:34:33,949 --> 01:34:39,330
So that was kind of like blues combination with rock, because Elvis became more of a rock kind of song.

1132
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:43,951
But in the late 50s, 1950s and 60s, now we got to say the 19 in front of it.

1133
01:34:43,971 --> 01:34:44,551
Ain't that crazy?

1134
01:34:44,571 --> 01:34:45,732
Some of us have been alive for a while.

1135
01:34:46,432 --> 01:34:47,392
You got to put all four numbers.

1136
01:34:47,472 --> 01:34:47,552
OK.

1137
01:34:47,612 --> 01:34:48,512
All right.

1138
01:34:49,392 --> 01:34:50,153
What year were you born?

1139
01:34:50,193 --> 01:34:51,373
I'm like, OK.

1140
01:34:53,412 --> 01:34:54,232
Wow, OK.

1141
01:34:54,553 --> 01:34:59,695
In the late 1950s and 60s, a new sound was spreading across America.

1142
01:34:59,735 --> 01:35:03,016
That was called soul music.

1143
01:35:03,496 --> 01:35:08,599
And actually, soul music is like a combination of rhythm and blues and the gospel vocal style.

1144
01:35:08,699 --> 01:35:11,160
Now, this music spoke to the heart and moved the soul.

1145
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:15,562
Now, over in Detroit, Michigan, there was something called Motown happening.

1146
01:35:16,062 --> 01:35:19,183
Barry Gordy was a brilliant producer, writer.

1147
01:35:19,203 --> 01:35:22,064
And he was like, we're going to turn this thing out and make it excellent.

1148
01:35:22,104 --> 01:35:22,785
And we're going to make it.

1149
01:35:23,525 --> 01:35:26,226
enough that it can cross over and everybody can like this music.

1150
01:35:26,826 --> 01:35:30,688
So this first song we're gonna do was by a Motown artist.

1151
01:35:31,128 --> 01:35:36,690
And this was actually their number, this was their first number one song.

1152
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:39,511
And it came out in, let's see, it came out in 1965.

1153
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,672
It was their first number one hit.

1154
01:35:42,292 --> 01:35:44,273
I know y'all know this and you can at least give me a little sway.

1155
01:35:44,313 --> 01:35:44,633
Here we go.

1156
01:35:44,873 --> 01:35:46,834
Come on y'all, here we go, come on, here we go.

1157
01:35:48,668 --> 01:35:49,688
If you know it, come on, sing it.

1158
01:35:50,649 --> 01:35:57,131
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day.

1159
01:35:57,151 --> 01:35:59,071
Oh, I can hear everybody in the choir singing.

1160
01:35:59,151 --> 01:36:03,873
All right, when it's cold, when it's cold outside.

1161
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:07,481
I've got the month of May.

1162
01:36:08,402 --> 01:36:09,142
Sounds good, y'all.

1163
01:36:09,162 --> 01:36:09,863
Come on, let's sing it.

1164
01:36:10,143 --> 01:36:20,530
Well, I guess you'll say, you'll say, what can make me feel this way?

1165
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:25,953
My girl, my girl, my girl, talking about you.

1166
01:36:26,173 --> 01:36:29,660
I've got so much honey, the bees envy me.

1167
01:36:40,568 --> 01:36:46,870
got a sweeter song than the bees in the trees.

1168
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:48,011
Come on, y'all.

1169
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:48,751
Sing along with me.

1170
01:36:49,291 --> 01:36:59,374
Well, I guess you say, what can make me feel this way?

1171
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:05,977
My girl, my girl, my girl, talking about my girl.

1172
01:37:12,763 --> 01:37:13,784
All right, we should probably end it.

1173
01:37:15,285 --> 01:37:21,088
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1174
01:37:21,668 --> 01:37:21,929
Right.

1175
01:37:21,989 --> 01:37:25,311
I haven't had to talk and sing at the same time in a long time, y'all.

1176
01:37:25,331 --> 01:37:25,671
Hold on.

1177
01:37:25,991 --> 01:37:31,234
This is when you say, OK, open up your notebook to this page here, and y'all work it out for the next five minutes.

1178
01:37:31,274 --> 01:37:31,795
But hold on.

1179
01:37:35,957 --> 01:37:36,798
I had to go with my.

1180
01:37:37,865 --> 01:37:43,387
my sister known as the Queen of Soul, as the 1960s brought protest songs and protest music.

1181
01:37:44,027 --> 01:37:48,549
This song was originally, became famous by Otis, well, he wrote it.

1182
01:37:48,829 --> 01:37:59,832
Otis Redding wrote this song, but she took it and just like, so most people assume it's her song, but there actually was someone else who put it out first, but we give RiRi all the credit for this one, y'all ready?

1183
01:38:03,494 --> 01:38:03,974
I'm getting a little,

1184
01:38:06,712 --> 01:38:08,713
What you want?

1185
01:38:08,773 --> 01:38:11,114
Baby, I got it.

1186
01:38:11,174 --> 01:38:12,754
What you need?

1187
01:38:13,095 --> 01:38:14,635
Do you know I got it?

1188
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:20,437
And all I'm asking is for a little respect when you come home.

1189
01:38:20,497 --> 01:38:30,300
Hey, baby, when you come home, mister, I ain't gonna do you wrong.

1190
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:31,621
Why you gone?

1191
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:36,379
I ain't gonna do you wrong, cause I don't want to.

1192
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:42,007
And all I'm asking is for a little respect when you come home.

1193
01:38:42,748 --> 01:38:45,251
Baby, when you get home.

1194
01:38:45,271 --> 01:38:45,332
Now.

1195
01:38:50,172 --> 01:38:53,816
I'm about to give you all my money.

1196
01:38:54,637 --> 01:39:04,346
And all I'm asking in return, honey, is give me my purpose when you get home.

1197
01:39:04,386 --> 01:39:07,069
Baby, when you get home.

1198
01:39:08,711 --> 01:39:09,311
Now.

1199
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:28,588
If y'all know it, come on and sing with me.

1200
01:39:28,648 --> 01:39:32,653
Ooh, your kisses sweeter than honey.

1201
01:39:33,694 --> 01:39:34,835
And guess what?

1202
01:39:35,196 --> 01:39:36,877
So is my money.

1203
01:39:38,049 --> 01:39:42,472
And all I want you to do for me is bring it to me when you get home.

1204
01:39:43,273 --> 01:39:47,916
Baby, whip it to me when you get home.

1205
01:39:47,936 --> 01:39:49,477
Hey, come on, sing along with me.

1206
01:39:49,517 --> 01:39:51,798
Say R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

01:39:52,118 --> 01:39:54,040

1209
01:39:56,281 --> 01:39:56,521
What?

1210
01:39:56,841 --> 01:39:59,803
Take care of T-C-P-L.

1211
01:40:00,284 --> 01:40:01,685
My little respect.

1212
01:40:03,826 --> 01:40:05,947
Oh, a little respect.

1213
01:40:06,007 --> 01:40:08,287
Hey, I get tired.

1214
01:40:08,848 --> 01:40:10,608
I keep on trying.

1215
01:40:10,928 --> 01:40:14,110
Said you're running on a full line.

1216
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:16,811
I need your respect.

1217
01:40:17,571 --> 01:40:20,254
When you get home, I know that I want it.

1218
01:40:20,554 --> 01:40:21,395
Respect.

1219
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:23,537
When you get home, come and go back to the bridge.

1220
01:40:23,577 --> 01:40:24,037
Try it again.

1221
01:40:24,878 --> 01:40:26,419
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

1222
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,681
Find out what it means to me.

1223
01:40:29,042 --> 01:40:30,963
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

1224
01:40:31,564 --> 01:40:33,185
Take care of TCP.

1225
01:40:35,708 --> 01:40:38,610
Oh, yeah.

1226
01:40:39,071 --> 01:40:40,172
Respect.

1227
01:40:40,352 --> 01:40:40,992
Hey.

1228
01:40:42,794 --> 01:40:43,154
Woo.

1229
01:40:44,876 --> 01:40:46,477
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1230
01:40:46,977 --> 01:40:48,117
We having us a good old time.

1231
01:40:48,137 --> 01:40:49,058
I'm having a good time, y'all.

1232
01:40:49,078 --> 01:40:50,338
I'm having a good time.

1233
01:40:50,358 --> 01:40:53,099
I feel like you're at my private party here, and we're just jamming.

1234
01:40:53,179 --> 01:40:53,599
All right.

1235
01:40:55,460 --> 01:41:03,683
So you know the 60s was a time of protesting, and songs were coming out in the 60s about what was going on in the world.

1236
01:41:03,763 --> 01:41:07,564
And this is a song that was written in protest to the Vietnam War.

1237
01:41:07,744 --> 01:41:11,385
And I know y'all are of the right generation to know where we going with this.

1238
01:41:12,166 --> 01:41:13,166
Our brother Marvin.

1239
01:41:14,798 --> 01:41:16,239
If you know, y'all can sing along.

1240
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:16,800
Here we go.

1241
01:41:18,481 --> 01:41:25,266
Mother, mother, there's too many of you crying.

1242
01:41:27,367 --> 01:41:34,293
Brother, brother, brother, there's far too many of you dying.

1243
01:41:35,834 --> 01:41:38,996
You know we've got to find a way.

1244
01:41:40,468 --> 01:41:45,932
to bring some loving here today.

1245
01:41:46,452 --> 01:41:52,556
Father, Father, we don't need to escalate.

1246
01:41:54,338 --> 01:42:03,284
You see, war is not the answer, for only love can conquer hate.

1247
01:42:03,304 --> 01:42:06,926
You know we've got to find a way.

1248
01:42:08,447 --> 01:42:12,831
to bring some lovin' here today.

1249
01:42:12,951 --> 01:42:13,672
Sisters is first.

1250
01:42:13,992 --> 01:42:15,854
Picket line, sister.

1251
01:42:16,154 --> 01:42:18,156
And picket sign, sister.

1252
01:42:18,456 --> 01:42:22,039
Don't punish me with brutality.

1253
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:28,906
Come on, talk to me so we can see what's going on.

1254
01:42:30,027 --> 01:42:31,248
What's going on.

1255
01:42:31,748 --> 01:42:33,370
Tell me what's going on.

1256
01:42:34,562 --> 01:42:36,123
What's going on?

1257
01:42:36,183 --> 01:42:36,883
Hey.

1258
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:55,415
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1259
01:42:56,155 --> 01:42:58,837
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

1260
01:42:59,517 --> 01:43:03,299
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, yeah.

1261
01:43:04,972 --> 01:43:11,697
Mother, mother, everybody thinks we're wrong.

1262
01:43:13,358 --> 01:43:16,420
Oh, but who are they to judge us?

1263
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,962
Simply because our hair is long.

1264
01:43:20,042 --> 01:43:22,164
I love when I have my long dreadlocks, but what can I say?

1265
01:43:22,784 --> 01:43:28,148
You know, we've got to find a way to bring some understanding.

1266
01:43:28,968 --> 01:43:30,411
here today.

1267
01:43:30,591 --> 01:43:35,759
Now say, brother, picket lines, brother, and picket signs.

1268
01:43:36,561 --> 01:43:40,106
Don't punish me with brutality.

1269
01:43:40,888 --> 01:43:42,210
Come on, talk to me.

1270
01:43:43,475 --> 01:43:51,577
So you can see what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on, what's going on.

1271
01:43:52,517 --> 01:43:57,759
I want to know what's going on.

1272
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:01,100
Yeah.

1273
01:44:04,988 --> 01:44:06,529
I got to make some choices.

1274
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:09,031
Let's see.

1275
01:44:09,531 --> 01:44:10,291
Well, you know what?

1276
01:44:10,331 --> 01:44:13,153
Let's do Bill Withers because I love that song.

1277
01:44:13,173 --> 01:44:14,114
It just makes me happy.

1278
01:44:16,655 --> 01:44:20,237
When I wake up in the morning.

1279
01:44:20,257 --> 01:44:24,399
It's always a blessing to have some feel good music and Bill Withers.

1280
01:44:25,863 --> 01:44:28,365
He was a master songwriter, Grandma's Hands.

1281
01:44:28,886 --> 01:44:35,071
And this is a really beautiful song that I've seen after-school kids do this with little sticks and shakas.

1282
01:44:35,151 --> 01:44:38,774
And my granddaughter, who's 18 months, loves this song.

1283
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:40,216
So this is a universal favorite.

1284
01:44:40,516 --> 01:44:42,057
So I hope it blesses your heart, too.

1285
01:44:42,097 --> 01:44:43,218
And it goes something like this.

1286
01:44:45,741 --> 01:44:48,103
When I wake up in the morning, love,

1287
01:44:50,622 --> 01:44:53,644
And the sunlight hurts my eyes.

1288
01:44:55,465 --> 01:45:03,430
And something without warning, love, hangs heavy on my mind.

1289
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:10,474
But then I look at you, and the world's all right with me.

1290
01:45:13,258 --> 01:45:26,584
Ooh, just one look at you, and I know it's going to be, if you know it, jump on in, a lovely day.

1291
01:45:29,325 --> 01:45:31,066
Thank you, Christian, for backing me up.

1292
01:45:32,186 --> 01:45:35,047
A lovely day.

1293
01:45:37,889 --> 01:45:39,309
A lovely day.

1294
01:45:43,549 --> 01:45:52,232
When the day that lies ahead of me seems impossible to face.

1295
01:45:53,072 --> 01:46:00,474
When someone else instead of me always seems to know the way.

1296
01:46:00,494 --> 01:46:07,957
But baby, but then I look at you, yeah, and the world's all right with me.

1297
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:25,438
Just one look at you and I know it's gonna be a lovely day.

1298
01:46:26,078 --> 01:46:29,100
A lovely day.

1299
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,622
A lovely day.

1300
01:46:37,018 --> 01:46:41,488
Hey, hey, hey, it's gonna be a lovely day.

1301
01:46:47,032 --> 01:46:48,994
Yeah.

1302
01:46:49,495 --> 01:46:51,176
So yes.

1303
01:46:52,177 --> 01:46:58,945
So I didn't know what the crowd might be in terms of demographics, but we're going to go here because it's a teachable moment.

1304
01:46:59,305 --> 01:47:03,549
So did y'all know like back in the 70s, so that was 77.

1305
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:08,334
But in 1978, there was a group called Chic, and they brought out this hit.

1306
01:47:09,215 --> 01:47:11,257
called Good Times.

1307
01:47:11,858 --> 01:47:12,798
Do y'all remember that?

1308
01:47:12,818 --> 01:47:14,960
Do y'all remember that song?

1309
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:15,901
But here's the thing, right?

1310
01:47:16,361 --> 01:47:28,012
We're going to consolidate time, because we want you to understand how there were these young kids in New York City, and they were like scratching with turntables and all that good stuff.

1311
01:47:28,452 --> 01:47:32,296
And they started sampling before you had to ask permission.

1312
01:47:32,376 --> 01:47:34,998
And they just, they took this hit by,

1313
01:47:37,009 --> 01:47:37,350
Chic.

1314
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:42,941
So just to remind you what it sounded like, this is the hit that came out by Chic.

1315
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:45,386
If you know this, raise your hand.

1316
01:47:45,406 --> 01:47:46,007
It goes like this.

1317
01:47:46,828 --> 01:47:47,850
Good times.

1318
01:47:49,733 --> 01:47:52,454
These are the good times.

1319
01:47:52,874 --> 01:47:54,035
Yeah.

1320
01:47:54,275 --> 01:47:57,196
Leave your cares behind.

1321
01:47:57,456 --> 01:47:58,297
Leave your hands.

1322
01:47:58,917 --> 01:48:01,518
These are the good times.

1323
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:04,479
Come on, if you know it, sing it, because we need some more good times around here.

1324
01:48:05,219 --> 01:48:06,160
Good times.

1325
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:07,240
All right, got some dances.

1326
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:07,800
Come on, y'all.

1327
01:48:08,161 --> 01:48:10,782
These are the good times.

1328
01:48:12,863 --> 01:48:15,984
All new state of mind.

1329
01:48:17,316 --> 01:48:19,877
These are the good times.

1330
01:48:20,357 --> 01:48:21,538
But y'all know what happened, right?

1331
01:48:22,278 --> 01:48:23,219
So this is what it became.

1332
01:48:23,699 --> 01:48:27,120
I said a hip, a hop, to hip it, to hip it, to the hip, hip hop.

1333
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,542
And you don't stop rocking to the bang, bang, boogie.

1334
01:48:29,562 --> 01:48:32,263
Say up, jump, to the rhythm of the boogity beat.

1335
01:48:32,343 --> 01:48:32,563
Ha!

1336
01:48:32,943 --> 01:48:36,885
And now what you hear is not a text that I'm rapping to the beat.

1337
01:48:37,725 --> 01:48:41,427
And me, the groove, and my friends are going to try to move your feet.

1338
01:48:42,047 --> 01:48:50,592
You see, I am, I say Special K, and I like to say hello to the black, to the white, the red, and the brown, the purple, and yellow.

1339
01:48:50,652 --> 01:48:53,734
But first, I got to bang, bang the boogie to the boogie.

1340
01:48:53,754 --> 01:48:55,955
So up, jump the boogie to the bang, bang boogie.

1341
01:48:55,975 --> 01:48:56,595
Let's rock.

1342
01:48:57,116 --> 01:48:57,936
You don't stop.

1343
01:48:58,156 --> 01:49:00,477
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock.

1344
01:49:01,218 --> 01:49:02,339
Yeah.

1345
01:49:03,599 --> 01:49:04,340
Woo-hoo!

1346
01:49:06,534 --> 01:49:07,835
Yes!

1347
01:49:08,396 --> 01:49:10,477
Yes, hunty!

1348
01:49:11,418 --> 01:49:26,790
So that song was released in 79, but on March, not March, whoo, January 5th, 1980, that, Rapper's Delight became the first hip hop single to reach the Billboard Top 40.

1349
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:29,652
That was huge, that was huge, huge, huge.

1350
01:49:30,132 --> 01:49:32,234
And it signaled that hip hop ain't going anywhere.

1351
01:49:32,314 --> 01:49:35,176
Rap and hip hop, as much as people said, oh, it's a fad, guess what, y'all, that was 1980.

1352
01:49:36,417 --> 01:49:38,000
It's 2023, it's still rocking.

1353
01:49:38,301 --> 01:49:40,685
And it became the top three in the UK.

1354
01:49:40,725 --> 01:49:41,266
And guess what, honey?

1355
01:49:41,286 --> 01:49:42,348
It was number one in Canada.

1356
01:49:44,834 --> 01:49:45,834
My husband went to college in Canada.

1357
01:49:45,854 --> 01:49:47,075
We have a great passion for Canada.

1358
01:49:47,115 --> 01:49:47,775
We love Canada.

1359
01:49:48,295 --> 01:49:50,036
All right, so we coming down to the end, y'all.

1360
01:49:50,056 --> 01:49:54,798
But I want to do one last song because this is one of my favorite songs of all time.

1361
01:49:54,998 --> 01:49:57,058
I'm a big, big, big Stevie Wonder fan.

1362
01:49:57,118 --> 01:50:04,141
I saw Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin when I was like nine years old at the Boston Garden is what it was called at the time.

1363
01:50:04,241 --> 01:50:08,743
And I just said, when I grow up, I want to sing background vocals for Stevie Wonder.

1364
01:50:10,199 --> 01:50:12,023
And I, oh Jesus, do I not have the lyrics?

1365
01:50:12,083 --> 01:50:13,345
I'm gonna fake my way through this one.

1366
01:50:13,486 --> 01:50:13,806
Okay.

1367
01:50:14,969 --> 01:50:15,630
That's frightening.

1368
01:50:15,991 --> 01:50:16,231
Okay.

1369
01:50:18,382 --> 01:50:21,764
I mean, I've sung it a few times, but you know, it's different when you gotta stand up and fake it.

1370
01:50:21,784 --> 01:50:23,386
Well, you know, we gonna make it work.

1371
01:50:23,446 --> 01:50:25,227
We gonna make it do what it do, baby, okay?

1372
01:50:26,988 --> 01:50:35,154
And I always said I wanted to be Aretha Franklin at that time, but Aretha had a rough life, so I'm thankful that that didn't happen, and I wanted to sing background for Stevie Wonder.

1373
01:50:36,495 --> 01:50:41,938
So we just gonna sing a little bit of this and send us on our way, and just know that I'll be loving you for always.

1374
01:50:42,539 --> 01:50:44,160
My husband and I, we've been married for 37 years.

1375
01:50:47,187 --> 01:50:49,908
Yes, 37.

1376
01:50:50,849 --> 01:50:51,629
Now, you know what?

1377
01:50:52,989 --> 01:50:56,731
I'm just, I can't believe that I do not have this on, but you know what we're about to do?

1378
01:50:57,071 --> 01:51:04,494
Because you know there's a friend of mine called Google, and he just, he just, ooh, he just makes things happen, y'all.

1379
01:51:04,994 --> 01:51:07,355
So, can you believe that?

1380
01:51:07,415 --> 01:51:09,316
Of all my songs, this is my favorite song.

1381
01:51:09,356 --> 01:51:13,478
That's probably why I didn't bother to put it on it, because I thought I could fake it, but no, uh-uh, baby.

1382
01:51:14,038 --> 01:51:14,918
We're going to get Stevie right.

1383
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:18,700
So yes, it's called As.

1384
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:21,662
And we had this played at our 25th wedding anniversary.

1385
01:51:21,862 --> 01:51:24,443
And we're going to have it played at our 50th, baby, because we're going to make it.

1386
01:51:25,663 --> 01:51:26,904
We just got to stay alive.

1387
01:51:27,264 --> 01:51:28,965
Staying alive, staying alive.

1388
01:51:28,985 --> 01:51:29,345
All right.

1389
01:51:29,865 --> 01:51:30,426
Here we go.

1390
01:51:30,926 --> 01:51:32,026
I hope it's a blessing to you.

1391
01:51:32,086 --> 01:51:33,367
We slowed it down a little bit.

1392
01:51:34,513 --> 01:51:44,698
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving, and the rosebuds know to bloom in early May.

1393
01:51:45,438 --> 01:51:55,303
Just as hate knows love's the cure, you can rest your mind assured that I'll be loving you always.

1394
01:51:56,383 --> 01:52:19,688
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow But in passing we'll grow older every day Just as all that's born is new You know what I say is true That I'll be loving you always Until the ocean covers every mile I need y'all help here

1395
01:52:20,548 --> 01:52:24,970
Always, until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea.

1396
01:52:25,831 --> 01:52:31,294
Always, until we dream of life and life becomes a dream.

1397
01:52:31,694 --> 01:52:34,535
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?

1398
01:52:34,555 --> 01:52:35,056
See, this is a mess.

1399
01:52:35,076 --> 01:52:36,016
Why are you getting on Google?

1400
01:52:36,877 --> 01:52:39,498
The acceptance is the way we pay.

1401
01:52:39,578 --> 01:52:41,119
They skipped a verse, but it's all good.

1402
01:52:41,919 --> 01:52:50,160
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee to last through forever and another day?

1403
01:52:51,341 --> 01:52:59,902
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning, and the seasons know exactly when to change.

1404
01:52:59,942 --> 01:53:01,042
Come on, spring, please.

1405
01:53:01,062 --> 01:53:10,244
Know through all your joy and pain that I'll be loving you always.

1406
01:53:10,264 --> 01:53:10,784
Another verse.

1407
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:21,367
As today I know I'm living, but tomorrow could make me the past, but that I mustn't fear.

1408
01:53:22,187 --> 01:53:28,092
For I'll know deep in my mind the love of me I've left behind, because I

1409
01:53:28,152 --> 01:53:30,413
I'll be loving you always.

1410
01:53:30,453 --> 01:53:30,753
Get ready.

1411
01:53:31,093 --> 01:53:34,654
Until the days and seas just stop and fly away.

1412
01:53:35,415 --> 01:53:35,835
Always.

1413
01:53:36,235 --> 01:53:39,736
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4.

1414
01:53:40,437 --> 01:53:40,817
Always.

1415
01:53:41,217 --> 01:53:44,738
Until the day that is the days that are no more.

1416
01:53:45,418 --> 01:53:45,999
Always.

1417
01:53:46,139 --> 01:53:47,479
All right.

1418
01:53:47,499 --> 01:53:47,819
You know what?

1419
01:53:47,839 --> 01:53:48,680
That's enough.

1420
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:51,240
Make it pretty.

1421
01:53:51,761 --> 01:53:52,821
Thank you.

1422
01:53:53,961 --> 01:53:54,762
Awesome.

1423
01:53:56,213 --> 01:53:57,674
That is our time.

1424
01:53:57,774 --> 01:53:59,275
It has been a blessing.

1425
01:53:59,495 --> 01:54:01,657
I hope this will not be the last time we see y'all.

1426
01:54:02,197 --> 01:54:04,518
Next time I see you, it'll be in the street, as they say.

1427
01:54:04,538 --> 01:54:06,039
My name's Katani.

1428
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:07,640
This is Mark Copeland.

1429
01:54:08,741 --> 01:54:09,281
Bless you.

1430
01:54:09,341 --> 01:54:10,242
Thank you for having us.

1431
01:54:10,322 --> 01:54:11,043
It's been a blast.

1432
01:54:14,825 --> 01:54:17,507
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1433
01:54:18,467 --> 01:54:21,849
Give it up once again for Katani Sumner and Mark Copeland III.

1434
01:54:26,518 --> 01:54:35,272
So I kind of had a sense that I was going to be on the right track with this pair of excellent musicians.

1435
01:54:35,971 --> 01:54:38,792
Um, thank, thank you so much, Mark and Katani.

1436
01:54:38,992 --> 01:54:41,012
Uh, that was an awesome set.

1437
01:54:41,992 --> 01:54:46,153
Um, and we're so blessed to have you grace our little stage up in here.

1438
01:54:46,233 --> 01:54:46,613
Wow.

1439
01:54:47,093 --> 01:54:47,714
Just wow.

1440
01:54:48,154 --> 01:54:48,714
Just wow.

1441
01:54:49,574 --> 01:54:57,476
Um, so this is a wrap for this live edition of WMCC's monthly words and music program.

1442
01:54:58,156 --> 01:55:03,277
We're, we're really thrilled to be kicking off Black History Month by visiting with you

1443
01:55:03,933 --> 01:55:06,854
in your living rooms in other household places.

1444
01:55:07,414 --> 01:55:21,136
I want to thank Lisa once again, Lisa Crossman, for stepping up to tonight's challenge and bringing new salt and light to the table.

1445
01:55:21,156 --> 01:55:26,697
A virtual high five to my man Kyle Douglas back there on the cameras.

1446
01:55:29,117 --> 01:55:31,958
And to MCM's Kevin Harrington, who's

1447
01:55:32,634 --> 01:55:37,679
going back to the studio, but who was here earlier helping us to get set up on the technical side.

1448
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:41,764
I mean, it takes a lot to put one of these programs together, believe me.

1449
01:55:42,544 --> 01:55:48,230
Thank you all for spending another evening enjoying what the WMCC has to offer.

1450
01:55:48,791 --> 01:55:51,994
If heck doesn't freeze over, and it just might,

1451
01:55:53,695 --> 01:55:58,457
We'll be back in March with another edition of First Friday's Words and Music.

1452
01:55:59,157 --> 01:56:05,299
So before we fade to black, here's one more reminder about what's happening next at your WMCC.

1453
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:11,201
Elders know you can come have lunch with us, 12 noon, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

1454
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:12,782
Call 781-483-3042 to make a reservation.

1455
01:56:16,183 --> 01:56:21,404
