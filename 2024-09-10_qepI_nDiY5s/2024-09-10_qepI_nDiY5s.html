    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=224.243s">Capital</a>  Purchases.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=225.084s">Capital</a>  Purchases, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=226.745s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=227.205s">Number</a>  four, Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=229.882s">I</a>  just was looking for a report on, I'm assuming this is for the Brooks boiler hot water heater.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=242.892s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=245.172s">As</a>  part of my later operations report, I talk about the Brooks domestic hot water heater. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=250.013s">A</a>  quick view as it relates to capital projects, we're not ready to purchase just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=254.414s">However,</a>  the two alternatives B2Q provided for us, one is a condensing hot water heater that has significant efficiencies, but still runs off of natural gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=268.318s">The</a>  price point is in the $92,000 range. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=272.242s">They</a>  suggest with incidentals and other things budgeting up to $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=277.467s">The</a>  alternative three, if I remember correctly, is in the neighborhood of $349,000 for full electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=285.254s">um</a>  despite uh the the natural gas unit condensing hot water heater will allow the city to still make tremendous strides towards our sustainability and environmental goals but given the return on investment <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=303.459s">versus</a>  $349,000 and the lifespan of these pieces of equipment, which at most is 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=311.063s">It</a>  would not be a recommendation of myself or other members of the city and school staff that have been part of these phone calls and meetings to recommend the full electric, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=326.021s">So</a>  before we move forward with design heading into purchasing, I wanted to bring it before the committee because of the stated goals of the committee and the district.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=338.449s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=338.789s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=339.369s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=340.53s">If</a>  we could just delay the vote on the capital purchases until we get to that item in the agenda, if that's okay?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=346.633s">So</a>  motion to table?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=347.774s">Motion</a>  to table, yes.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=349.075s">By</a>  Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=353.037s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=354.458s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=354.718s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=357.128s">capital</a>  purchases is tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=358.751s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=361.375s">We</a>  have superintendents updates and comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=363.899s">I'm</a>  gonna turn it over to Dr. Maurice Edwards and our superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=369.968s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=372.034s">welcome</a>  to our first school committee meeting of the year i hope you all had a restful and enjoyable summer and that you're as excited as i am to dive into a new school year full of possibilities before we get started i'd like to acknowledge the efforts of everyone who worked tirelessly over the summer to prepare for this school year <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=397.031s">Whether</a>  it was undergoing professional development, updating curricula, or getting our facilities ready, your hard work has not gone unnoticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=407.215s">Throughout</a>  the summer and in the early stages of the school year, we were fortunate to receive multiple donations of school supplies from our Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=419.597s">i</a>  want to thank mayor longo kern and everyone who donated to the mayor's annual summer school supply drive while also recognizing our medford high girls varsity basketball team for dropping the supplies off at the high school i'd also like to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=442.233s">the</a>  Members Plus Credit Union located on High Street for donating 50 backpacks full of school supplies last week.

Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=470.366s">The</a>  2024-25 school year unofficially began on Monday, August 19th, during new teacher induction week. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=479.169s">With</a>  over 60 new educators and paraprofessionals across the district at that point in time, the week served as a tremendous opportunity to welcome our new staff to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=491.152s">Among</a>  the many activities they participated in was a tour of our beautiful city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=497.395s">Our</a>  new educators visited Tufts University, the Medford Public Library, and here, the Chambers of City Hall, where they spoke with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=507.839s">I</a>  want to thank Tufts University Community Relations Director Rocco DiRico, the Medford Public Library, and Mayor Lungo-Koehn for hosting our new educators and informing them about our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=522.193s">Also,</a>  I would like to send a special thank you to Medford High School assistant principal, Mr. David Blouk, and Brooks Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=532.637s">Maria</a>  Michelli, two longtime residents with extensive knowledge of our city for leading the tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=542.0s">I'd</a>  like to welcome our new administrators as well, joining us for this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=548.104s">Many</a>  of them you've already met at the end of the school year, so I will not reintroduce them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=553.747s">But</a>  I would like to formally welcome Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=555.789s">Katie</a>  Bradley, who was named as our special education coordinator for the Missatuck and the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=564.972s">I</a>  also want to welcome Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=566.273s">Suzanne</a>  Fee, who is our coordinator of arts, who you'll be hearing from later on while recapping our summer programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=575.763s">Lastly,</a>  but definitely not least, among our other new administrative hires, I'd like to formally welcome, again, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=583.57s">Jennifer</a>  Silver, a longtime nurse at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=587.794s">who</a>  recently became our Director of Health Services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=591.943s">We're</a>  so lucky to have all of you here with us in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=596.846s">So</a>  on Monday, August 26th, that was the first day of school for all of our teachers and staff members. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=604.869s">We</a>  all gathered at Medford High School gym before staff dispersed to their respective buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=611.072s">It</a>  was wonderful to see so many familiar faces and feel the excitement buzzing through the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=618.615s">On</a>  Tuesday, August 27th, that was our first day of school for our students in grades one through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=626.438s">and</a>  I had the privilege of visiting all of our schools across the first few days of the new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=632.362s">Our</a>  students reconnected with friends, met their new teachers, and began to understand their new surroundings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=639.987s">The</a>  passion of our teachers, administration, and staff was evident throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=647.304s">With</a>  our MEEP program beginning on Tuesday, September 3rd, and kindergarten students following that Wednesday joining our hallways, our school community is officially all together again. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=662.6s">So</a>  now I will transition to news happening across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=668.596s">Medford</a>  High School made national headlines this summer for their positive work in battling chronic absenteeism. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=678.739s">Chronic</a>  absenteeism is defined as when students miss 10% of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=686.201s">to</a>  battle this issue among many initiatives implemented by high school principal miss cabral and her team students had the opportunity to use the gym during lunch hours for organized sports and other supervised

Medford High School experiencing one of the steepest declines in chronic absenteeism among all Massachusetts high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=723.641s">This</a>  story was first featured in the Associated Press. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=727.762s">and</a>  given that they are a wire news service, was featured across the country in various outlets, such as the

23rd anniversary of September 11, I just want to take a brief moment to speak and share on these two tragedies that have left an indelible mark on our nation and on so many lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1135.919s">we</a>  will always remember those who were lost, honor the bravery of first responders, and acknowledge the strength and resilience of all who were affected by these senseless attacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1151.494s">All</a>  of our Medford Public Schools staff were reminded again earlier this morning of our school safety protocols through a communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1161.383s">Staff</a>  are encouraged to reach out to building principals and senior administrators with any questions relating to our safety procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1173.604s">later</a>  this evening there will be a brief mention during the operations presentation later today in our schools we do strive to foster a community of empathy understanding and respect it is important for us to come together to remember and to support one another throughout the year <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1195.646s">we</a>  uphold the values of unity and compassion that were so profoundly demonstrated in the aftermath of these tragedies so today's agenda is packed with important topics that will encompass wide-ranging information about medford public schools <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1219.483s">We</a>  will hear about several grant opportunities

individuals, along with many others, helped shape a great summer in Medford for our students and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1277.832s">Immediately</a>  following that, there will be a report on enrollment and personnel update from Dr. Gallussi, and the final official presentation will be by Dr. Peter Cushing, giving us an update on operations happening in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1296.465s">I</a>  also want to take a moment to congratulate Dr. Cushing and his wife, Megan, who earlier this summer welcomed a beautiful baby girl to their family. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1307.376s">So</a>  congratulations on your new addition, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1312.27s">I</a>  also would like to just take a moment to say that there was originally a mistake in the first posted agenda that listed the condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1325.686s">And</a>  by mistake, we mistakenly listed Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1330.012s">Karen</a>  McGlynn-Devine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1332.374s">on</a>  the condolences section. <a

speak today. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1341.722s">She</a>  is alive and well, has fully accepted our apology for the error that took place when we were sending condolences to her aunt, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1354.311s">Pauline</a>  Leno Davis, Lennox Davis. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1357.854s">But</a>  we want to just say, thank you, Ms. <a

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1408.598s">So</a>  good evening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1411.02s">This</a>  recommendation to approve in 2021, the Medford Public Schools was awarded $350,000 from the Cummings Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1422.25s">We</a>  are truly, truly grateful for the partnership of Mr. Cummings and the Cummings Foundation supporting the Medford Public Schools in a variety of capacities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1434.139s">This</a>  $35,000 is one of the installments that we will be receiving for the next 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1443.904s">And</a>  so this is just for the school committee to recognize that you did approve the full grant in the amount of $350,000 in 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1452.609s">But</a>  we want to acknowledge every time we receive this generous donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1461.233s">from</a>  the Cummings Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1463.615s">And</a>  so I just want to bring this before the committee again. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1468.177s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1469.178s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1470.399s">Is</a>  there a motion for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1472.7s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1473.441s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1474.121s">I</a>  just have a quick question or a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1477.383s">If</a>  possible, when these recommendations come before us, if there is anything... <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1482.964s">sort</a>  of, I guess I'll say unusual about what the grant requirements are that those be listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1488.847s">And</a>  the reason it popped up as I was reading this was I remember hearing during the budget that there are particular stipulations in this grant about how we compensate our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1500.813s">So</a>  I would call that noteworthy just to sort of continue to remind folks about what our requirements are in order to accept and be in compliance with these grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1510.987s">like</a>  the letter that is attached talks about an impact report. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1514.851s">That's</a>  important because we want to make sure we're doing those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1517.353s">But</a>  if there are other things that sort of... <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1520.74s">outlying</a>  or restrict or govern in some way or operations, those things need to be called out in the memo as well so that we are just clear on what those things are before we approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1530.904s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1531.784s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1532.224s">And</a>  I do believe part of the stipulation for the Cummings grant is that we formally state when we receive it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1540.247s">That's</a>  how it was explained to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1541.448s">So</a>  I'll make sure to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1543.449s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1543.949s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1545.103s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1549.104s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1550.785s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1550.945s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1552.846s">Recommendation</a>  is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1554.886s">Number</a>  three, we have a recommendation to approve a $50,000 grant from Ernie Block Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1559.488s">Music</a>  Drives Us organization to the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1563.71s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1564.39s">Michelle</a>  Crowell, Principal of the Elementary School of the Roberts is here to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1569.292s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1570.192s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michelle Crowell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1576.94s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1578.621s">Thank</a>  you for having me here tonight to share some exciting news from the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1584.742s">After</a>  a successful concert last February, where approximately 700 parents attended, it was pretty apparent that we were in need of some updated musical equipment to continue to produce musical performances of this magnitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1600.635s">In</a>  collaboration with Dr. Stern, our music teacher, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1604.819s">Tara</a>  Sharest, a Roberts School parent, the Roberts School submitted a grant through Ernie Bach Jr.' <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1610.966s">'s</a>  Music Drives Us Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1615.17s">This</a>  is a competitive grant that schools and organizations in New England can apply for to support existing music programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1624.272s">Over</a>  the summer, the Music Drives Us Foundation notified the Roberts that they were going to award us a grant to purchase 40 new violins for our string students, a new grand piano, new student risers, a classroom set of ukuleles, and a new electric keyboard totaling approximately $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1647.065s">We</a>  are truly grateful to the Music Drives Us Foundation for this generous grant that will allow us to provide our students with the highest quality music education. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1657.593s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1676.263s">I</a>  have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1677.404s">Is</a>  there a limitation on the number of schools from a district who can apply for this kind of thing?</p>

    <p>[Michelle Crowell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1681.448s">I</a>  don't think that there's a limitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1684.49s">So</a>  there's some different criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1686.032s">So</a>  we applied specifically for equipment, but there are some different categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1692.177s">And</a>  it's...</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1693.899s">because</a>  I love this and you know I have a kid at the Roberts, so I'm super excited, but I also want to be thinking about our other elementary schools and equity across the district.</p>

    <p>[Michelle Crowell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1702.725s">I</a>  would encourage folks to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1704.847s">He'll</a>  be delivering, so Ernie Buck Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1707.509s">will</a>  be coming to the Roberts to do a personal delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1710.211s">I'll</a>  let you all know, he wants to, he's inviting everybody and he shows up with his truck, so we don't have the equipment yet, but he will be delivering everything to our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1723.996s">And</a>  it really just gives opportunity for our kids with music. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1726.897s">I</a>  think the ukulele set is going to be something that, you know, our kids learn recorder, which is really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1732.68s">But</a>  at the same time, like ukuleles are just so cool, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1736.882s">And</a>  so now our kids will have an opportunity to learn the ukulele in our music class. <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1741.484s">So</a>  it's exciting.</p>
