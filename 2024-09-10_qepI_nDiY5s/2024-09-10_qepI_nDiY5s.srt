00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:19,518
[SPEAKER_13]: No need for a second?

00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:20,518

46
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to sever the capital purchases by Member Rousseau.

47
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:36,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to amend the approval of the teacher budget line item.

48
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:39,995
[SPEAKER_10]: The vote was 5-0-2, not 5-1-1.

52
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:57,333
[SPEAKER_13]: So do you wanna vote on them separately since you severed them or did you just wanna amend them?

53
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,393
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just amend them.

54
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Just amend them, okay.

55
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:06,536
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're amending the June 24th, 2024 minutes.

00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:17,320
[SPEAKER_13]: And motion to approve everything, including the amendments from June 24th, 2024, other than the capital purchases.

[SPEAKER_13]: Member Intapa?

[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

63
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:27,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

64
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,255
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

65
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:29,996
[SPEAKER_13]: I love that.

66
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:32,758
[SPEAKER_13]: Bill's consent agenda is approved.

67
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:37,980
[SPEAKER_13]: We have reports of subcommittees.

68
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:42,923
[SPEAKER_13]: First up is our superintendent's updates in- Capital One.

69
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:45,024
[SPEAKER_22]: Capital Purchases.

70
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:46,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Capital Purchases, sorry.

71
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:47,185
[SPEAKER_13]: That's okay.

72
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:48,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Number four, Member Rousseau.

73
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:57,494
[SPEAKER_22]: I just was looking for a report on, I'm assuming this is for the Brooks boiler hot water heater.

74
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:04,512
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

75
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:09,133
[SPEAKER_20]: As part of my later operations report, I talk about the Brooks domestic hot water heater.

76
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:13,934
[SPEAKER_20]: A quick view as it relates to capital projects, we're not ready to purchase just yet.

77
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:26,797
[SPEAKER_20]: However, the two alternatives B2Q provided for us, one is a condensing hot water heater that has significant efficiencies, but still runs off of natural gas.

78
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:31,761
[SPEAKER_20]: The price point is in the $92,000 range.

79
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:36,446
[SPEAKER_20]: They suggest with incidentals and other things budgeting up to $150,000.

80
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:41,811
[SPEAKER_20]: The alternative three, if I remember correctly, is in the neighborhood of $349,000 for full electric.

81
00:04:45,254 --> 00:05:02,519
[SPEAKER_20]: um despite uh the the natural gas unit condensing hot water heater will allow the city to still make tremendous strides towards our sustainability and environmental goals but given the return on investment

82
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:09,862
[SPEAKER_20]: versus $349,000 and the lifespan of these pieces of equipment, which at most is 15 years.

83
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:24,450
[SPEAKER_20]: It would not be a recommendation of myself or other members of the city and school staff that have been part of these phone calls and meetings to recommend the full electric, unfortunately.

84
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:36,427
[SPEAKER_20]: So before we move forward with design heading into purchasing, I wanted to bring it before the committee because of the stated goals of the committee and the district.

85
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:38,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, sir.

86
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:39,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

87
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:39,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

88
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,153
[SPEAKER_22]: If we could just delay the vote on the capital purchases until we get to that item in the agenda, if that's okay?

89
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:47,354
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion to table?

90
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:48,775
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion to table, yes.

91
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:52,737
[SPEAKER_13]: By Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

92
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:53,658
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

93
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:54,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

94
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:55,359
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

95
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:58,390
[SPEAKER_13]: capital purchases is tabled.

96
00:05:58,751 --> 00:05:59,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

97
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,879
[SPEAKER_13]: We have superintendents updates and comments.

98
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,603
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna turn it over to Dr. Maurice Edwards and our superintendent.

99
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:10,609

00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:46,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it was undergoing professional development, updating curricula, or getting our facilities ready, your hard work has not gone unnoticed.

102
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:57,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Throughout the summer and in the early stages of the school year, we were fortunate to receive multiple donations of school supplies from our Medford community.

103
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:21,198
[SPEAKER_02]: i want to thank mayor longo kern and everyone who donated to the mayor's annual summer school supply drive while also recognizing our medford high girls varsity basketball team for dropping the supplies off at the high school i'd also like to thank

[SPEAKER_02]: the Members Plus Credit Union located on High Street for donating 50 backpacks full of school supplies last week.

105
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:37,601
[SPEAKER_02]: To everyone who donated to our schools, we sincerely appreciate your warmth and kindness.

106
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:44,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I also would like to thank the Medford Family Network for donations to the schools as well.

107
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:48,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, thank you for your support of the Medford Public Schools.

108
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:58,149
[SPEAKER_02]: The 2024-25 school year unofficially began on Monday, August 19th, during new teacher induction week.

109
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:10,512
[SPEAKER_02]: With over 60 new educators and paraprofessionals across the district at that point in time, the week served as a tremendous opportunity to welcome our new staff to Medford.

110
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:16,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Among the many activities they participated in was a tour of our beautiful city.

111
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:26,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Our new educators visited Tufts University, the Medford Public Library, and here, the Chambers of City Hall, where they spoke with the mayor.

112
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:40,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Tufts University Community Relations Director Rocco DiRico, the Medford Public Library, and Mayor Longo Kern for hosting our new educators and informing them about our community.

113
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:52,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I would like to send a special thank you to Medford High School assistant principal, Mr. David Blouk, and Brooks Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Ms.

114
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:59,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Maria Michelli, two longtime residents with extensive knowledge of our city for leading the tour.

115
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to welcome our new administrators as well, joining us for this school year.

116
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:12,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of them you've already met at the end of the school year, so I will not reintroduce them again.

117
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:15,729
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to formally welcome Ms.

118
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:23,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Katie Bradley, who was named as our special education coordinator for the Missatuck and the Roberts Elementary School.

119
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:26,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to welcome Ms.

120
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:34,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne Fee, who is our coordinator of arts, who you'll be hearing from later on while recapping our summer programming.

121
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:43,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, but definitely not least, among our other new administrative hires, I'd like to formally welcome, again, Ms.

122
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer Silver, a longtime nurse at Medford Public Schools.

123
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:51,462
[SPEAKER_02]: who recently became our Director of Health Services.

124
00:09:51,943 --> 00:09:54,949
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so lucky to have all of you here with us in Medford.

125
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:04,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So on Monday, August 26th, that was the first day of school for all of our teachers and staff members.

126
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:10,252
[SPEAKER_02]: We all gathered at Medford High School gym before staff dispersed to their respective buildings.

127
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:17,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wonderful to see so many familiar faces and feel the excitement buzzing through the air.

128
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:25,318
[SPEAKER_02]: On Tuesday, August 27th, that was our first day of school for our students in grades one through 12.

129
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:31,621
[SPEAKER_02]: and I had the privilege of visiting all of our schools across the first few days of the new year.

130
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:38,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Our students reconnected with friends, met their new teachers, and began to understand their new surroundings.

131
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:45,270
[SPEAKER_02]: The passion of our teachers, administration, and staff was evident throughout the district.

132
00:10:47,304 --> 00:11:00,738
[SPEAKER_02]: With our MEEP program beginning on Tuesday, September 3rd, and kindergarten students following that Wednesday joining our hallways, our school community is officially all together again.

133
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I will transition to news happening across the district.

134
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:17,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford High School made national headlines this summer for their positive work in battling chronic absenteeism.

135
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:25,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Chronic absenteeism is defined as when students miss 10% of the school year.

136
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:47,037
[SPEAKER_02]: to battle this issue among many initiatives implemented by high school principal miss cabral and her team students had the opportunity to use the gym during lunch hours for organized sports and other supervised activities as long as they attended all of their classes

137
00:11:48,775 --> 00:12:02,640
[SPEAKER_02]: This use of the gym space quickly gained popularity amongst the students, leading to Medford High School experiencing one of the steepest declines in chronic absenteeism among all Massachusetts high schools.

138
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,922
[SPEAKER_02]: This story was first featured in the Associated Press.

139
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:22,394
[SPEAKER_02]: and given that they are a wire news service, was featured across the country in various outlets, such as the Boston Globe, the Seattle Times, the US News and World Report, and more.

140
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:28,358
[SPEAKER_02]: NBC 10 also stopped by a few days later to speak with Ms.

141
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:35,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Cabral and our students in a video package that featured on the nightly news and in digital outlets.

142
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:47,831
[SPEAKER_02]: NBC 10 went on to inform us that this story is one of their most viewed videos on both TikTok and YouTube Shorts.

143
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:51,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations on going viral, Ms.

[SPEAKER_02]: The tremendous reach of this story is gratifying for our school leaders and a marvelous example of the impact we have as educators.

149
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:36,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving to the sports realm, the United Soccer Coaches Team Academic Achievement Award was presented to the Medford High School Mustangs Girls Soccer Team for the fourth consecutive year.

150
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:43,364
[SPEAKER_02]: recognizing their academic accomplishments over the 23-24 school year.

151
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:56,298
[SPEAKER_02]: The team's achievement of a 3.25 or higher composite grade point average encompassing all players earned them this unique distinction.

152
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:06,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Notably, they are one of only six Massachusetts high school girls soccer teams to receive the award this year.

153
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:19,013
[SPEAKER_02]: To our players and coaches, Coach Rocco Cieri, we are so proud of you for fostering an environment of success both on the field and in the classroom.

[SPEAKER_02]: So again, please pay attention.

171
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:25,173
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of wonderful things happening in the arts.

172
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:34,580
[SPEAKER_02]: For our listening community members, this week is the kickoff of all of our school curriculum nights.

173
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:44,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Curriculum nights serve as a wonderful opportunity for parents and caregivers to meet your child's teacher and school leaders.

174
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:51,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Parents and caregivers will hear more about what your child will be learning throughout the school year.

175
00:16:52,652 --> 00:17:01,696
[SPEAKER_02]: The Roberts Elementary School and the Andrews Middle School, their curriculum night will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, September 10th.

182
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:59,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to just notify the community that next Wednesday, September 18th, will be our half day.

183
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:04,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Teachers will be undergoing professional development sessions in the afternoon.

184
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:11,787
[SPEAKER_02]: These professional development sessions often provide opportunities for teachers to collaborate with peers,

185
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:16,675
[SPEAKER_02]: share experiences, build a supportive professional community.

186
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:23,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And this collaboration leads to a more cohesive school culture and collective problem solving.

187
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:53,858
[SPEAKER_02]: So before previewing the rest of tonight's agenda and in reflection of the events that took place last week in Winder, Georgia, and ahead of the 23rd anniversary of September 11, I just want to take a brief moment to speak and share on these two tragedies that have left an indelible mark on our nation and on so many lives.

188
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:09,285
[SPEAKER_02]: we will always remember those who were lost, honor the bravery of first responders, and acknowledge the strength and resilience of all who were affected by these senseless attacks.

189
00:19:11,494 --> 00:19:20,262
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our Medford Public Schools staff were reminded again earlier this morning of our school safety protocols through a communication.

190
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:31,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Staff are encouraged to reach out to building principals and senior administrators with any questions relating to our safety procedures.

191
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:54,765
[SPEAKER_02]: later this evening there will be a brief mention during the operations presentation later today in our schools we do strive to foster a community of empathy understanding and respect it is important for us to come together to remember and to support one another throughout the year

192
00:19:55,646 --> 00:20:16,936
[SPEAKER_02]: we uphold the values of unity and compassion that were so profoundly demonstrated in the aftermath of these tragedies so today's agenda is packed with important topics that will encompass wide-ranging information about medford public schools

193
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:27,526
[SPEAKER_02]: We will hear about several grant opportunities that Medford Public Schools has been fortunate enough to receive.

194
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:32,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have school principals here with us this evening.

195
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:41,893
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Principal Miss Kroll of the Roberts Elementary School and our Principal Miss Cabral here this evening, who will be presenting at different points.

196
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:54,217
[SPEAKER_02]: We also hear about summer programming achievements presented by Assistant Superintendent, Dr. Galluzzi, our Director of Pupil Services, Ms.

197
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:58,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan Bowen, our Director of Arts, Ms.

[SPEAKER_02]: Cabral from Medford High School.

200
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:16,071
[SPEAKER_02]: These individuals, along with many others, helped shape a great summer in Medford for our students and families.

201
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:35,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Immediately following that, there will be a report on enrollment and personnel update from Dr. Gallussi, and the final official presentation will be by Dr. Peter Cushing, giving us an update on operations happening in the Medford Public Schools.

202
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:47,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to take a moment to congratulate Dr. Cushing and his wife, Megan, who earlier this summer welcomed a beautiful baby girl to their family.

203
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:50,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations on your new addition, Dr. Cushing.

204
00:21:52,270 --> 00:22:04,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I also would like to just take a moment to say that there was originally a mistake in the first posted agenda that listed the condolences.

205
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:09,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And by mistake, we mistakenly listed Ms.

206
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:11,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Karen McGlynn-Devine.

207
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,755
[SPEAKER_02]: on the condolences section.

208
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:16,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to share that Ms.

209
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:21,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Karen McGlynn Devine and myself, we had the opportunity to speak today.

210
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:34,131
[SPEAKER_02]: She is alive and well, has fully accepted our apology for the error that took place when we were sending condolences to her aunt, Ms.

211
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Pauline Leno Davis, Lennox Davis.

212
00:22:37,854 --> 00:22:41,257
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want to just say, thank you, Ms.

213
00:22:41,437 --> 00:22:43,959
[SPEAKER_02]: McGlynn-Devine for your understanding.

214
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:50,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And we apologize for the mistake that took place with the listing.

215
00:22:52,045 --> 00:23:00,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna just say to all, thank you for being here this evening, for your unwavering commitment to our schools in Medford.

216
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:03,353
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am looking forward to a great year ahead.

217
00:23:03,754 --> 00:23:04,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

218
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:06,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Midson.

219
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:21,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two, we have recommendation to approve $35,000 grant from the Cummings Foundation to the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, which is our CCSR group for the 2024-2025 school year.

220
00:23:21,863 --> 00:23:24,387
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to turn it over to you again, Dr. Edward Vincent.

221
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:29,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So good evening again.

222
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:41,689
[SPEAKER_02]: This recommendation to approve in 2021, the Medford Public Schools was awarded $350,000 from the Cummings Foundation.

223
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:52,939
[SPEAKER_02]: We are truly, truly grateful for the partnership of Mr. Cummings and the Cummings Foundation supporting the Medford Public Schools in a variety of capacities.

224
00:23:54,139 --> 00:24:03,204
[SPEAKER_02]: This $35,000 is one of the installments that we will be receiving for the next 10 years.

225
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:12,549
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is just for the school committee to recognize that you did approve the full grant in the amount of $350,000 in 2021.

226
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:16,191
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want to acknowledge every time we receive this generous donation.

227
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:23,214
[SPEAKER_02]: from the Cummings Foundation.

228
00:24:23,615 --> 00:24:27,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just want to bring this before the committee again.

229
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:28,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

230
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Vinson.

231
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:31,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion for approval?

232
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:32,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor?

233
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:33,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham?

234
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:35,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a quick question or a comment.

235
00:24:37,383 --> 00:24:41,826
[SPEAKER_07]: If possible, when these recommendations come before us, if there is anything...

236
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:48,627
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of, I guess I'll say unusual about what the grant requirements are that those be listed.

237
00:24:48,847 --> 00:25:00,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason it popped up as I was reading this was I remember hearing during the budget that there are particular stipulations in this grant about how we compensate our staff.

238
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:10,058
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would call that noteworthy just to sort of continue to remind folks about what our requirements are in order to accept and be in compliance with these grants.

239
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:13,970
[SPEAKER_07]: like the letter that is attached talks about an impact report.

240
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:17,293
[SPEAKER_07]: That's important because we want to make sure we're doing those things.

241
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:19,055
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there are other things that sort of...

242
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:30,404
[SPEAKER_07]: outlying or restrict or govern in some way or operations, those things need to be called out in the memo as well so that we are just clear on what those things are before we approve.

243
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve.

244
00:25:31,784 --> 00:25:32,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

245
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:39,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do believe part of the stipulation for the Cummings grant is that we formally state when we receive it.

246
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it was explained to me.

247
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:43,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll make sure to do that.

248
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:43,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

249
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:44,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

250
00:25:45,103 --> 00:25:49,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

251
00:25:49,104 --> 00:25:49,925
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

252
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:50,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

253
00:25:50,945 --> 00:25:51,865
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

254
00:25:52,846 --> 00:25:54,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Recommendation is approved.

255
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:59,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Number three, we have a recommendation to approve a $50,000 grant from Ernie Block Jr.

256
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:03,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Music Drives Us organization to the Roberts Elementary School.

257
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:03,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

258
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:09,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Michelle Crowell, Principal of the Elementary School of the Roberts is here to present.

259
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:09,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

260
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:10,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

261
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

262
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:23,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for having me here tonight to share some exciting news from the Roberts School.

263
00:26:24,742 --> 00:26:39,427
[SPEAKER_12]: After a successful concert last February, where approximately 700 parents attended, it was pretty apparent that we were in need of some updated musical equipment to continue to produce musical performances of this magnitude.

264
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:44,779
[SPEAKER_12]: In collaboration with Dr. Stern, our music teacher, and Ms.

265
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:50,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Tara Sharest, a Roberts School parent, the Roberts School submitted a grant through Ernie Bach Jr.'

266
00:26:50,966 --> 00:26:53,709
[SPEAKER_12]: 's Music Drives Us Foundation.

267
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:03,079
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a competitive grant that schools and organizations in New England can apply for to support existing music programs.

268
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:24,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Over the summer, the Music Drives Us Foundation notified the Roberts that they were going to award us a grant to purchase 40 new violins for our string students, a new grand piano, new student risers, a classroom set of ukuleles, and a new electric keyboard totaling approximately $50,000.

269
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:36,012
[SPEAKER_12]: We are truly grateful to the Music Drives Us Foundation for this generous grant that will allow us to provide our students with the highest quality music education.

270
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:37,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

271
00:27:42,737 --> 00:27:43,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful, Ms.

272
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:43,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Crowell.

273
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:43,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

274
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:51,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Please thank the parent who helped apply for this grant.

275
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:55,087
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to turn it over to Member Reinfeld and Member Ruseau.

276
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:56,904
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a question.

277
00:27:57,404 --> 00:28:01,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a limitation on the number of schools from a district who can apply for this kind of thing?

278
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:04,210
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that there's a limitation.

279
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,912
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's some different criteria.

280
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:11,757
[SPEAKER_12]: So we applied specifically for equipment, but there are some different categories.

281
00:28:12,177 --> 00:28:12,518
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's...

282
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:22,665
[SPEAKER_10]: because I love this and you know I have a kid at the Roberts, so I'm super excited, but I also want to be thinking about our other elementary schools and equity across the district.

283
00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:24,827
[SPEAKER_12]: I would encourage folks to apply.

284
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:27,469
[SPEAKER_12]: He'll be delivering, so Ernie Buck Jr.

285
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:30,190
[SPEAKER_12]: will be coming to the Roberts to do a personal delivery.

286
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:42,199
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll let you all know, he wants to, he's inviting everybody and he shows up with his truck, so we don't have the equipment yet, but he will be delivering everything to our school.

287
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:46,697
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really just gives opportunity for our kids with music.

288
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:52,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the ukulele set is going to be something that, you know, our kids learn recorder, which is really exciting.

289
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,282
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, like ukuleles are just so cool, right?

290
00:28:56,882 --> 00:29:01,464
[SPEAKER_12]: And so now our kids will have an opportunity to learn the ukulele in our music class.

291
00:29:01,484 --> 00:29:03,585
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's exciting.

292
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:05,187
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.

293
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:05,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

294
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:07,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau, do you still have a question?

295
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:07,930
[SPEAKER_13]: That was it.

296
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

297
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:12,214
[SPEAKER_13]: So obviously there must be a motion for approval of $50,000 by Member Intapa.

298
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:13,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Do I have a second?

299
00:29:13,456 --> 00:29:13,836
[SPEAKER_13]: A second.

300
00:29:14,357 --> 00:29:16,719
[SPEAKER_13]: By Member Branley.

301
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,301
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

302
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:18,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

303
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:19,902
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

304
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:21,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion is passed.

305
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:22,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

306
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:23,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

307
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:24,467
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll invite you all when he comes.

308
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:25,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds great.

309
00:29:28,615 --> 00:29:35,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Number four, we have a recommendation to approve $200,000 grant from the Bar Foundation to Medford High School.

310
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:36,003

[SPEAKER_13]: Marta Cabral, principal of Medford High School is here to give us some information.

312
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:41,649

00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:47,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

314
00:29:48,111 --> 00:30:02,749

315
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:18,957
[SPEAKER_15]: The Barr Foundation's education program focuses on the transformation of the public high school experience to advance excellence and equity for young people, especially for students of color and other marginalized students across New England.

316
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:27,160
[SPEAKER_15]: We're excited to partner with the Barr Foundation and appreciate their generosity as well as their support in actualizing the important work.

[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

326
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:40,848

00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

329
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

330
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:52,137
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you to the Bar Foundation.

331
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:59,783
[SPEAKER_13]: They also provide funding to the city in our Office of Prevention, Outreach, and Municipal Vulnerability Work.

332
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:01,782
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're wonderful, thank you.

333
00:31:03,023 --> 00:31:09,069
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a recommendation to approve a field trip for the culinary arts program to visit Johnson and Wales University in Rhode Island.

334
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:12,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Here to present is Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent.

335
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:14,585
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

336
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:14,905
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

337
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:19,689
[SPEAKER_20]: As you know, all out-of-state and overnight field trips need to come before this body.

338
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:33,019
[SPEAKER_20]: Johnson & Wales is a world-renowned culinary school that is offering 23 students, juniors and seniors, the opportunity to come to experience a day there, view the program, their facilities, dorms,

339
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:36,901
[SPEAKER_20]: and enjoy meals created by their culinary students.

340
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:42,365
[SPEAKER_20]: Recommendation to approve this out-of-state field trip for September 17th.

341
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:44,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve.

342
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:44,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor?

343
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:46,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Branley?

344
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:50,350
[SPEAKER_08]: My child is a student in this program, so I don't know if I should abstain from the vote.

345
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all for it, but I don't know if it's a conflict, so.

346
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:53,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a conflict.

347
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:55,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody?

348
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:56,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Is she attending?

349
00:31:57,054 --> 00:31:57,594
[SPEAKER_08]: She's attending.

350
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:58,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Still not a conflict.

351
00:31:59,514 --> 00:32:00,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's fine.

352
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:01,835
[SPEAKER_08]: They're telling me it's good.

353
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'll second then.

354
00:32:04,935 --> 00:32:05,796
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to pass.

355
00:32:06,396 --> 00:32:08,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I want to go.

356
00:32:08,476 --> 00:32:09,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to come eat.

357
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:11,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, perfect.

358
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval.

359
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:14,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I hear?

360
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:15,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody did.

361
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:18,699
[SPEAKER_13]: By Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Branley.

362
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Before we call the roll, Member Rousseau.

363
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,781
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure you know what I'm going to ask, that we get the field trip form.

364
00:32:26,556 --> 00:32:28,757
[SPEAKER_22]: and all that Corey details at a subsequent meeting.

365
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:32,400
[SPEAKER_22]: This is happening before our next meeting.

366
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,583
[SPEAKER_20]: I can submit it to the committee on blind carbon copy.

367
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,184
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's no chance of debate or deliberation.

368
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:48,790
[SPEAKER_22]: Just I'm not suggesting we don't let them go, but we do a policy requiring that form to be approved before the field trip.

369
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,771
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll pretend that

370
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:59,379
[SPEAKER_22]: about the policy for a minute, I guess, but just, you know, let's not put these forward without including all the proper paperwork.

371
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,061
[SPEAKER_22]: So we don't have that problem.

372
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:03,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I, can I ask a question on that?

373
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:07,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Just being a newbie, if the field trip is within the first couple of weeks.

374
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:33,628
[SPEAKER_22]: we haven't had time to approve it because this is our first meeting and the field trip is next week how does that work policy-wise just curious i just honestly don't know remember um so i mean if the field trip was planned before the end of the school year for the beginning of the school year then it could be submitted then i would say that we should have a special meeting with a one-item agenda we can be in and out in 10 minutes but we we do have that policy because

375
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:45,640
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I don't want to rehash history, but that's why we do require that we approve the form with, you know, the nursing looked at it and the nursing has signed off on it and all the other stuff.

376
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,184
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm sure that will all happen, but we are also supposed to give the sign off on that.

377
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:52,905
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's how I would.

378
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:58,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, of course, you know, this could have come up literally a week ago.

379
00:33:59,858 --> 00:34:26,918
[SPEAKER_22]: so i think you know we don't exercise special meetings that often we just save them for like emergencies but i think we should use them more often um for things such as this so we can comply with our own policies there's a motion for approval by member reinfeld seconded by member brandley all those in favor all right all those opposed motion passes enjoy um the field trip to our 23 students

380
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Number six, report on summer programming.

381
00:34:30,914 --> 00:34:34,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Suzanne B. Gallussi, Assistant Superintendent, Ms.

382
00:34:34,176 --> 00:34:36,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Joan Bowen, Director of Pupil Services, Ms.

383
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:41,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Suzanne Fee, Director of Fine Arts, Mr. Paul Tuxera, Director of EL, and Ms.

384
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Marta Cabral, Principal of Mecklenburg High School.

385
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:48,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll turn it over to you all.

386
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:50,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

387
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:51,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome back.

388
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:55,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have one update before I kick it off.

389
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:56,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for introducing everyone.

390
00:34:58,206 --> 00:35:00,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Director Fee is not here this evening.

391
00:35:00,227 --> 00:35:06,488
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will be covering the music and the art programming as well as the early literacy.

392
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:16,510
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do think if there are any questions, Dr. Chiesa was also instrumental in the early literacy or the literacy program over the summer.

393
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,771
[SPEAKER_14]: So she's also available.

394
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:19,891
[SPEAKER_14]: But thank you very much.

395
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:22,472
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to have Joan Bowen start first.

396
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:27,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening and welcome back.

397
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:35,095
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm here to report on the extended school year services that were held this summer for our students with disabilities.

398
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:42,480
[SPEAKER_09]: So each summer, the special education department provides a wide range of services during the extended school year.

399
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:52,208
[SPEAKER_09]: These are for students who are at risk for substantial regression or experiencing difficulty with recruitment of previous learned skills.

400
00:35:52,808 --> 00:36:05,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So this year, our teams met and 251 students were recommended for a wide variety of specialized services and approximately 201 students attended this year.

401
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:15,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So our special education programs were housed in three different locations.

402
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:23,619
[SPEAKER_09]: We had programs, our access program for middle school and high school that were located at Medford High School.

403
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:29,061
[SPEAKER_09]: At the Missatuck Elementary, we had a wide range of tutoring and related services.

404
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:35,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the Roberts Elementary School, we had our meet programming as well as our connections program.

405
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:44,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the right hand side just tells you the breakdown of the different types of programs that we held, as well as how many weeks they run for.

406
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:54,496
[SPEAKER_09]: So the programs for our students who require our most vulnerable students is a six week program, five days per week from July 1st to August 9th.

407
00:36:55,177 --> 00:36:57,839
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we also have four week programs.

408
00:36:58,379 --> 00:37:03,523
[SPEAKER_09]: One is a five week program, and that also includes some of our substantially separate programs

409
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:09,034
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be language-based program, learning group program, as well as access program.

410
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:14,235
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we also have a three week, I mean, a three day per week, four week program.

411
00:37:14,696 --> 00:37:19,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's for our MEAP students, our language-based students and our learning group students.

412
00:37:20,297 --> 00:37:21,637
[SPEAKER_09]: This is three days per week.

413
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,038
[SPEAKER_09]: They come in, they receive their services.

414
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:27,158
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't require the five day program.

415
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And then lastly is our tutoring and related services program.

416
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,540
[SPEAKER_09]: That's also a four week, three,

417
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,083
[SPEAKER_09]: three day per week program that ran from July 9th to August 1st.

418
00:37:39,784 --> 00:37:47,169
[SPEAKER_09]: The next slide just gives you a breakdown of how many students were enrolled in our specific programs this year.

419
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:50,512
[SPEAKER_09]: And we go from our connections pre-K to five.

420
00:37:50,592 --> 00:37:50,972
[SPEAKER_09]: We had...

421
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:53,497
[SPEAKER_09]: 33 students.

422
00:37:54,518 --> 00:38:02,885
[SPEAKER_09]: We had approximately 89 students that attended for tutoring and there's a wide range in between for all the different services.

423
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:15,195
[SPEAKER_09]: The related services included speech, occupational therapy, physical therapy, vision, hearing, and those service as well as counseling and social skills groups.

424
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:25,617
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, well, not lastly, but this is the breakdown of the staffing that is required to run our extended school year program.

425
00:38:26,258 --> 00:38:28,599
[SPEAKER_09]: We had one program supervisor this year.

426
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,460
[SPEAKER_09]: We had approximately 20 teachers that worked.

427
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Two were reading specialists.

428
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:43,166
[SPEAKER_09]: We had 34 paraprofessionals who supported the programs, and one was also a paraprofessional supporting a student who attended summer fun.

429
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,787
[SPEAKER_09]: We had speech therapists, occupational therapists.

430
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:55,312
[SPEAKER_09]: We also had an occupational therapy assistant, school adjustment counselors, nursing, BCBAs, and our vision specialists providing services.

431
00:38:58,245 --> 00:39:10,292
[SPEAKER_09]: The success of this program could not run as well as it does every year if it wasn't for the devoted special education staff who commit to working each and every summer.

432
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,914
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't run this program without them.

433
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:18,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to express, if you can go to the next slide, please.

434
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:23,640
[SPEAKER_09]: My sincere appreciation and gratitude to all of the staff who worked this summer.

435
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:28,184
[SPEAKER_09]: A special thanks to Kim Clinton, who's our special education coordinator.

436
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:41,978
[SPEAKER_09]: She was our program supervisor and really led the way in organizing all of the schedules, the hiring, the transportation for this program, as well as all of the special education coordinators and ETLs.

437
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:54,489
[SPEAKER_09]: who worked tirelessly from February till June, and the planning and organizing of the extended school year program, scheduling, and collaborating with families and staff throughout the year.

438
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,532
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will continue this program next year.

439
00:39:57,552 --> 00:40:03,537
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have any questions, I can take them now, or if you want to wait till the end of the presentation.

440
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:10,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Olapade?

441
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you so much for this presentation.

442
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:14,278
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a couple of quick questions.

443
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:24,711
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the first slide about the 251 students that were recommended compared to the 201 that actually attended, was the reduction from the recommendation to the actual because of...

444
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:27,441
[SPEAKER_18]: parental decisions or was it a?

445
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,382
[SPEAKER_09]: It was based on parental decisions.

446
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:30,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So we planned for the 251.

447
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:36,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Their parents have decided not to have their students participate.

448
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:38,684
[SPEAKER_09]: They go away for the summer months.

449
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:46,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Some parents have elected to have their students attend summer fun and not access our extended school year.

450
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:54,247
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was a wide variety, but we send out a survey in February and we send it out several times to see who will be accessing.

451
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:56,288
[SPEAKER_09]: the extended school year service.

452
00:40:56,468 --> 00:41:00,030
[SPEAKER_09]: So we planned for that, but last minute changes come about.

453
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:04,692
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also offer transportation so students can access those services.

454
00:41:05,216 --> 00:41:05,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

455
00:41:06,137 --> 00:41:15,482
[SPEAKER_18]: And then for the dates and times slide with the six week, four week and various programs, is there a set duration for each program or is it the same for all of them?

456
00:41:15,502 --> 00:41:17,183
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it just depended on the total amount.

457
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:20,304
[SPEAKER_09]: So we look at the recommendations that the team has made.

458
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:24,627
[SPEAKER_09]: So for our connections program, one of our access programs,

459
00:41:25,087 --> 00:41:29,991
[SPEAKER_09]: those are typically our six-week programs, and then everything else falls into the other four-week.

460
00:41:30,832 --> 00:41:37,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Our four-week, three-day program is typically MEAP, a language-based program, and our learning group program.

461
00:41:37,457 --> 00:41:39,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And then tutoring is always the three days.

462
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,020
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

463
00:41:41,141 --> 00:41:41,461
[SPEAKER_18]: And then...

464
00:41:42,062 --> 00:41:54,127
[SPEAKER_18]: for each student that gets directed towards one program or another, is that based off both the recommendation of the department plus the conjunction with their parental or their custodian, like whoever's working with them day to day in their classroom and their parents?

465
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:54,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

466
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:57,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So these decisions are made within the team meeting.

467
00:41:57,928 --> 00:42:01,349
[SPEAKER_09]: So it could be an annual review or a three-year re-evaluation.

468
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,951
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is one of the components that has to be considered on a yearly basis.

469
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:07,552
[SPEAKER_09]: So they walk through...

470
00:42:08,132 --> 00:42:19,795
[SPEAKER_09]: they look at has the student experienced regression or the inability to recoup skills after say a long vacation or after the winter break, the spring break.

471
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:23,216
[SPEAKER_09]: So they take some data and that's when the recommendation is made.

472
00:42:23,256 --> 00:42:30,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And then based on what the team feels the student requires, then they would offer the six week, the four week, that sort of thing.

473
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:31,679
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

474
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:32,159
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

475
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, member Ruseau.

476
00:42:36,624 --> 00:42:36,984
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

477
00:42:37,644 --> 00:42:38,545
[SPEAKER_22]: Were you fully staffed?

478
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:39,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we were.

479
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:40,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful news.

480
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:45,367
[SPEAKER_09]: I think maybe more so than we needed, but I'd rather be overstaffed than under.

481
00:42:45,827 --> 00:42:47,728
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a problem not many people probably have.

482
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:48,789
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

483
00:42:49,129 --> 00:42:55,331
[SPEAKER_22]: And when we survey whether people are going to participate, do we ask them why if they say no?

484
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:56,972
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

485
00:42:57,052 --> 00:43:05,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have to check the survey to see, but we do reach out to them several times just to confirm, but I can see if there's a reason why and get back to you on that one.

486
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:11,771
[SPEAKER_22]: It just sounds like something that might be interesting just to make sure there's not something that you could do differently that would increase.

487
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:17,394
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also too, we try to ask further, is it transportation they required access?

488
00:43:17,454 --> 00:43:27,738
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's also included in that survey, but I can reach out to Kim Clinton to find out if there are any specific reasons and maybe we tweak the survey going forward to get a better understanding of why.

489
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:28,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

490
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:31,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

491
00:43:38,393 --> 00:43:39,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, good evening, everyone.

492
00:43:39,436 --> 00:43:41,101
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Cushy.

493
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:53,855
[SPEAKER_19]: The EL Summer Enrichment Program, we have various programs that happen starting in the end of June.

494
00:43:53,875 --> 00:44:04,360
[SPEAKER_19]: It starts with a one-week STEM camp at Hanscom Air Force Base through STAR Labs, which is a week-long STEM camp for students in fifth and sixth grade.

495
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:08,602
[SPEAKER_19]: They do robotics, engineering, computer design.

496
00:44:09,723 --> 00:44:10,943
[SPEAKER_19]: They build rockets.

497
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:12,044
[SPEAKER_19]: They get to launch them.

498
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:13,245
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of fun.

499
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:34,125
[SPEAKER_19]: and after that ends then we roll into our summer enrichment program which it's basically uh k through eight uh k through five is at the missatuck our numbers actually doubled this year we typically have about 45 students in the program during the summer and this year we had almost 100.

500
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:41,607
[SPEAKER_19]: Then at the middle school, which we host up at the high school, we run a middle school summer enrichment program.

501
00:44:41,647 --> 00:44:48,690
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we do an add-on program for credit recovery for high school students to get what they need.

502
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:56,333
[SPEAKER_19]: So if they failed a class, it's a combination of enrichment and credit recovery.

503
00:44:57,188 --> 00:45:04,273
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we also offer tutoring at the Medford Public Library, and that's for our secondary students.

504
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:10,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Teachers will do office hours, just one hour, and it fluctuates based on availability.

505
00:45:10,637 --> 00:45:12,318
[SPEAKER_19]: It's mornings and evenings.

506
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:26,227
[SPEAKER_19]: And students who need help with getting their summer reading done, picking out books, any other math or history packets at the secondary level, there's a teacher there to kind of guide them through that through the summer.

507
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,293
[SPEAKER_19]: And those, Dr. Cushing, if you want, I just have pictures of what we did.

508
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:44,062
[SPEAKER_19]: Also at the elementary program, we contracted with High Touch High Tech, which is a science organization that's in Massachusetts and Maine, I think.

509
00:45:44,882 --> 00:45:48,364
[SPEAKER_19]: And they come and we get to pick what they're going to do.

510
00:45:48,464 --> 00:45:51,566
[SPEAKER_19]: I think last year was bridges, beams, and columns.

511
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:53,287
[SPEAKER_19]: This year they did electricity.

512
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:55,548
[SPEAKER_19]: They learned how to build circuits.

513
00:45:56,369 --> 00:46:01,151
[SPEAKER_19]: And so the scientists come and they rotate through the grades throughout the day.

514
00:46:03,273 --> 00:46:03,673
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Cushing?

515
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:12,888
[SPEAKER_19]: And then with the elementary program, because this is enrichment and it's paid for out of Title III, we try to plan a field trip every week.

516
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:16,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Because of our increased numbers, we actually had to separate out.

517
00:46:16,671 --> 00:46:19,573
[SPEAKER_19]: So all of the students got to go to the Franklin Park Zoo.

518
00:46:20,834 --> 00:46:35,065
[SPEAKER_19]: But the Children's Museum and the Aquarium, we divided it K-2 and 3-5 to offset the numbers because Title III will pay the admission, the transportation costs, everything for the students for the enrichment program.

519
00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:37,366
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Cushing.

520
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:42,248
[SPEAKER_19]: These are just various photos of the field trips that the students went on.

521
00:46:42,808 --> 00:46:46,250
[SPEAKER_19]: And the summer curriculum is tied into what the students are learning.

522
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:52,913
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, there's an animal component, there's sea life, there's, you know, general academics that also happen.

523
00:46:53,613 --> 00:46:55,494
[SPEAKER_19]: And then these are photos from Starbase.

524
00:46:56,894 --> 00:46:58,315
[SPEAKER_19]: This was actually building bridges.

525
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:05,598
[SPEAKER_19]: And this was CAD design for programming the robots too.

526
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,361
[SPEAKER_19]: And then again, as Ms.

527
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:13,863
[SPEAKER_19]: Bowen said, this wouldn't have happened without the support of the teachers.

528
00:47:13,883 --> 00:47:16,965
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the list of all of the teachers.

529
00:47:17,025 --> 00:47:18,305
[SPEAKER_19]: I was also fully staffed.

530
00:47:18,385 --> 00:47:23,809
[SPEAKER_19]: I was very lucky because of the increased numbers that I managed to get some additional staff to support the program.

531
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:27,711
[SPEAKER_19]: And then also a special thanks to Anthony Petralis because

532
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:47,030
[SPEAKER_19]: what we do is our program ends at noon but what we've done with him is arranged that we have 30 slots for the after-school program that they can go into summer fun i provide the teachers as an add-on so students can stay and get the full day in if they choose

533
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,491
[SPEAKER_10]: So there were 90 enrolled, 30 got to do Summer Fun.

534
00:47:57,891 --> 00:48:00,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Were there people who wanted to do Summer Fun that didn't get to?

535
00:48:00,592 --> 00:48:02,212
[SPEAKER_19]: So we took a list.

536
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:07,833
[SPEAKER_19]: So we send out a separate permission slip after students show up and register, and we keep a separate list.

537
00:48:07,853 --> 00:48:13,735
[SPEAKER_19]: So as students, not every student that signed up could go on to Summer Fun because we only have the 30 slots.

538
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:15,055
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't overwhelm the program.

539
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:17,695
[SPEAKER_19]: but anyone that signed up for it.

540
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:24,177
[SPEAKER_19]: So if a student was absent, we could rotate through, we would call and say, oh, you know, child can stay today.

541
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:29,518
[SPEAKER_19]: So almost everybody got, you know, that wanted to got to experience it at some point.

542
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:34,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

543
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,919
[SPEAKER_22]: The number's growing so much.

544
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,020
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you talk about why?

545
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,900
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I had an answer.

546
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:48,783
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a surprise when the registration started coming in and we were counting up the numbers and making the class lists.

547
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,784
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, I don't have a reason.

548
00:48:54,485 --> 00:48:55,105
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take it.

549
00:48:55,405 --> 00:49:01,487
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I said, it gave me it because of the registration and we'll accept registrations the day of, because again, it's enrichment.

550
00:49:03,368 --> 00:49:10,974
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, it allowed us to give us a little lag time because we had that week off to recruit two more teachers for the program.

551
00:49:11,254 --> 00:49:11,414
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

552
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:13,175
[SPEAKER_22]: And Title III pays for all of this, you said?

553
00:49:13,336 --> 00:49:15,017
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it all comes out of the Title III grant.

554
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:15,597
[SPEAKER_22]: Fabulous.

555
00:49:16,058 --> 00:49:16,338
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

556
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:20,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Intapa?

557
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:21,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

558
00:49:21,571 --> 00:49:23,933
[SPEAKER_05]: This probably isn't an important question.

559
00:49:23,953 --> 00:49:25,094
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just me being curious.

560
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,396
[SPEAKER_05]: What CAD program are they teaching the kids?

561
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:28,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they teaching them SolidWorks?

562
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:30,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what the name of the program is.

563
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it looks like the program that I was taught in college.

564
00:49:33,862 --> 00:49:41,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that we're teaching these students such a, I mean, like it might not be, but it looks just like that program.

565
00:49:41,889 --> 00:49:44,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I use it at a college level and at an industry level.

566
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:45,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to...

567
00:49:45,683 --> 00:50:02,994
[SPEAKER_19]: So like I said, they were building bridges, so I don't know if that's what that program would be for, but then the other program in the other picture was coding so they could actually program their robots to follow a track, and then the robots fight the little robot wars.

568
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:04,235
[SPEAKER_19]: That's amazing.

569
00:50:04,395 --> 00:50:07,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I had that when I was, like, that's crazy.

570
00:50:07,597 --> 00:50:09,118
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a little more than just one week.

571
00:50:09,278 --> 00:50:09,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

572
00:50:09,678 --> 00:50:14,401
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only time you can get, but it's... I wanted to take that, I'm sorry, my mic is echoing.

573
00:50:15,703 --> 00:50:37,221
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere um i'll speak softer um i just want to echo how great that is um because again like this is these are this is the time to learn these programs and you know it'll excel the future um through that so that i just wanted to send my regards is awesome thank you great thank you very much

574
00:50:46,621 --> 00:50:51,246
[SPEAKER_15]: So at the high school, we offered fifth quarter, formerly known as our credit recovery program.

575
00:50:52,227 --> 00:50:57,272
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can, oh, I'm sorry.

576
00:50:57,633 --> 00:51:04,179
[SPEAKER_15]: It was led by Riley Jones, who was the director of the summer school program, who's also a teacher at the high school.

577
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,784
[SPEAKER_15]: We offered it to both middle and high school students over the summer.

578
00:51:09,898 --> 00:51:14,821
[SPEAKER_15]: To start, we set learning expectations and objectives for both students and for teachers.

579
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:34,734
[SPEAKER_15]: For teachers, teachers provided instruction through the standards for the content area along with providing competency-based exams and assessments because it was over a short amount of time for the year that the students were engaged in the work throughout the year.

580
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:42,344
[SPEAKER_15]: We offered 30 days of instruction, so the program ran from the end of the school year to the first week of August.

581
00:51:42,884 --> 00:51:45,567
[SPEAKER_15]: We offered middle school courses and high school courses.

582
00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:57,039
[SPEAKER_15]: For middle school, ELA and math were identified as content areas for summer school, along with high school courses that spanned between English, math, science, and history.

583
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:07,256
[SPEAKER_15]: For the middle school numbers, we had 23 students enrolled in math, 17 students passed, 74% pass rate.

584
00:52:07,636 --> 00:52:15,281
[SPEAKER_15]: For ELA, we had 19 students enrolled, 16 student passed and 84% with an 84% pass rate.

585
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:27,068
[SPEAKER_15]: For the high school, we had for our math programs, integrated math, geometry and algebra two, we had between a 94% pass rate to 100% pass rate.

586
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:38,276
[SPEAKER_15]: For the English and humanities, we had an English course and a world slash US history course that we offered.

587
00:52:38,296 --> 00:52:40,618
[SPEAKER_15]: 26 were in the English, 85% pass rate.

588
00:52:40,638 --> 00:52:43,219
[SPEAKER_15]: History, 19 students were enrolled and 79% pass rate.

589
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:52,544
[SPEAKER_15]: For the sciences, we had 18 students.

590
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:54,766
[SPEAKER_15]: That was our bigger number of science students.

591
00:52:55,427 --> 00:53:02,235
[SPEAKER_15]: In biology, which is grade nine, 18 students enrolled, 16 students passed with an 89% pass rate.

592
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:07,541
[SPEAKER_15]: For chemistry, we had 100% pass rate for the five students that were enrolled in that program.

593
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:23,316
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to give a special thanks to all of the teachers that were there every single day over five weeks span along with Riley Jones who oversaw the program and then the administration that was there for support when needed.

594
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,603
[SPEAKER_10]: So the students who didn't pass, what support is available?

595
00:53:37,003 --> 00:53:38,163
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens next for them?

596
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:42,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so for the students that did not pass, it was primarily based on attendance.

597
00:53:42,325 --> 00:53:47,667
[SPEAKER_15]: So they missed so many days and they weren't able to recover the credit.

598
00:53:47,787 --> 00:53:55,110
[SPEAKER_15]: They are working with their school counselors now as to how we can recover those credits in order for them to graduate with their cohort on time.

599
00:53:58,564 --> 00:53:59,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thank you very much.

600
00:53:59,684 --> 00:54:00,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Member Lopate.

601
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:01,305
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

602
00:54:01,665 --> 00:54:03,926
[SPEAKER_18]: A question about the students that are entered into this program.

603
00:54:04,026 --> 00:54:19,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a process in which we work with them going to the next school year about how to either be more consistent with attendance or about how to kind of work with your teachers after school about making sure that they're not in danger of falling behind their credits just so that understandably that these students were struggling to begin with.

604
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:25,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Are there ways for us to kind of continue to support them going forward that they may not have had previously?

605
00:54:25,444 --> 00:54:39,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, so we are taking a deep dive in the data from our Saturday Academy that we had running throughout the school year to the students that are enrolled in summer school and how can we best support them throughout the whole entire school year, starting from day one.

606
00:54:40,713 --> 00:54:49,638
[SPEAKER_15]: We are working with the school counseling department who are now going to be pushing into classes and providing workshops, especially for grade nine and 10.

607
00:54:49,678 --> 00:54:53,941
[SPEAKER_15]: We're finding they need a lot more executive functioning, planning and supports.

608
00:54:55,182 --> 00:54:57,904
[SPEAKER_15]: And then as well as tracking these students.

609
00:54:57,944 --> 00:55:17,417
[SPEAKER_15]: So for like the students that were already, for example, ninth and 10th grade primarily that have engaged in our fifth quarter this year, how do we make sure that they're not on track for that starting this week so that they're not constantly trying to catch up and they're at a deficit?

610
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:18,458
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

611
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:27,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

612
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:46,423
[SPEAKER_14]: So in June, I'm sorry, I'm just going to advance my... In June, I came with Dr. Chiesa and we presented that we got a vacation grant through the Department of Education to focus on literacy acceleration for our students.

613
00:55:47,123 --> 00:55:50,984
[SPEAKER_14]: This spanned Medford Public School students from...

614
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:54,304
[SPEAKER_14]: grades one to grade nine.

615
00:55:55,506 --> 00:56:02,817
[SPEAKER_14]: The focus of this was on literacy and grade level skills and easing the transition to the next grade level.

616
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:07,234
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go to the next slide, please.

617
00:56:07,454 --> 00:56:20,266
[SPEAKER_14]: This was already presented in June, but as a reminder, students in the Acceleration Academy, they were selected by invitation based on district-wide data.

618
00:56:20,706 --> 00:56:29,213
[SPEAKER_14]: So at the elementary level for students in grades one through three, that was primarily DIBELS data with some of the MAP data.

619
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:31,896
[SPEAKER_14]: For students in grades four and five,

620
00:56:32,312 --> 00:56:36,174
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a combination of DIBELS data, MAP data, and MCAS data.

621
00:56:36,854 --> 00:56:46,639
[SPEAKER_14]: And for rising sixth graders and ninth graders, again, some of those students had DIBELS data as well as MAP growth and MCAS data.

622
00:56:49,701 --> 00:56:57,505
[SPEAKER_14]: This acceleration program was a full day program that took place at the McGlynn School for one week, the week of July 29th.

623
00:56:59,631 --> 00:57:01,292
[SPEAKER_14]: free breakfast and lunch was provided.

624
00:57:01,632 --> 00:57:13,260
[SPEAKER_14]: It was structured somewhat typical to a regular school day so that students were able to engage in literacy, core literacy instruction, as well as enrichment activities.

625
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,221
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a physical education teacher,

626
00:57:15,828 --> 00:57:18,110
[SPEAKER_14]: on staff and an art teacher on staff.

627
00:57:19,671 --> 00:57:27,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Each classroom, so the way the grant was set up was that it really was structured for small group targeted tiered instruction.

628
00:57:28,057 --> 00:57:36,743
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we made sure that we structured that format so that within each grade level span, we had multiple teachers in a classroom.

629
00:57:37,341 --> 00:57:43,244
[SPEAKER_14]: So each grade more, more in the younger grades and a little bit less as they progressed.

630
00:57:43,484 --> 00:57:52,408
[SPEAKER_14]: But we had about two to three teachers in each classroom so that we were able to target very specifically that small group instruction.

631
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:59,291
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that in those grades, there was a content teacher or a classroom teacher and a reading specialist.

632
00:58:02,282 --> 00:58:15,553
[SPEAKER_14]: We had, for the span, about 55 students in grades one through three, 16 students in grades four through five, and 15 students in rising grades six through nine.

633
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:24,080
[SPEAKER_14]: At the end of the grant program, Dr. Chiesa sent

634
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:35,103
[SPEAKER_14]: two surveys, one to the teachers, the participating teachers in the program, and another one to caregivers to elicit some feedback on how the program went.

635
00:58:36,144 --> 00:58:42,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Teachers, we got a lot of positive feedback from teachers in terms of the format that we had for that small group instruction.

636
00:58:43,371 --> 00:58:52,620
[SPEAKER_14]: that they were able to work collaboratively and really target the instruction and each kind of own some of that reading instruction.

637
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:59,526
[SPEAKER_14]: So there were some future recommendations to have the program start a little closer to when school gets out.

638
00:59:00,107 --> 00:59:03,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the feedback was that it needs to be a longer program.

639
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:14,875
[SPEAKER_14]: that one week was not enough, which we have been in active conversations about how we can increase this opportunity beyond DESE funding through a grant.

640
00:59:15,455 --> 00:59:19,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of the positives from teachers, they really enjoyed that daily schedule.

641
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:25,699
[SPEAKER_14]: They liked having co-teachers to facilitate with, and they loved the small group instruction.

642
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,801
[SPEAKER_14]: The feedback from caregivers,

643
00:59:33,296 --> 00:59:38,138
[SPEAKER_14]: 100% of caregivers said that they would love to have their students participate in this program again.

644
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,279
[SPEAKER_14]: They thought it was very beneficial.

645
00:59:40,299 --> 00:59:44,481
[SPEAKER_14]: They appreciated the ongoing communication.

646
00:59:45,121 --> 00:59:51,303
[SPEAKER_14]: They wished that it was a little bit longer or that there was some extended opportunities for extended care.

647
00:59:53,747 --> 01:00:00,090
[SPEAKER_14]: And the location, we were very mindful to have this housed at the McGlynn School for several reasons.

648
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:06,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Transportation was not part of this opportunity that we gave to our families.

649
01:00:06,933 --> 01:00:13,036
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the students that were invited, a lot of them primarily lived in that area.

650
01:00:13,396 --> 01:00:18,038
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we wanted to make sure that we were bringing the program to the students that needed it the most.

651
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:19,499
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition, that

652
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:29,346
[SPEAKER_14]: because our programs span from grades one to nine or high school, the McGlynn lent itself nicely to the space and the air conditioning.

653
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:42,930
[SPEAKER_14]: The next slide just shows a few pictures, not many, but just you can see the small group instruction, elementary on the outer and the sixth and ninth grade in the middle.

654
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,691
[SPEAKER_14]: And again,

655
01:00:47,216 --> 01:00:51,557
[SPEAKER_14]: This would not be possible without the teachers and the people heavily involved in this program.

656
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:56,299
[SPEAKER_14]: So Dr. Chiesa, the humanities director, was this program's facilitator.

657
01:00:57,219 --> 01:00:58,379
[SPEAKER_14]: She did a phenomenal job.

658
01:00:58,419 --> 01:01:12,764
[SPEAKER_14]: She worked very closely with our literacy coach, Kristen Howell, and then all of the teachers ranging from grade one to grade nine with our two specialists, as well as nursing coverage.

659
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:18,381
[SPEAKER_14]: if you have any questions about this opportunity before I move on to... Mayor.

660
01:01:20,963 --> 01:01:22,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau, then Member Reinfeld.

661
01:01:23,385 --> 01:01:24,366
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

662
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:32,393
[SPEAKER_22]: I noticed the comment in the teacher feedback that four days was fun, but the two weeks we did before was great.

663
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:34,494
[SPEAKER_22]: What is this two weeks we did before?

664
01:01:35,395 --> 01:01:40,059
[SPEAKER_14]: We've offered a couple opportunities for extended time in the summer.

665
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:43,260
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've had a couple of different formats that we've used.

666
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:49,146
[SPEAKER_14]: One year, last year or the year before, we've done two-week half-day program.

667
01:01:49,826 --> 01:01:54,170
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there's pros and cons to each format that you provide.

668
01:01:54,350 --> 01:02:02,678
[SPEAKER_14]: But for working parents, half-day is also quite difficult to drop students off and pick them up when we don't have transportation.

669
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:06,087
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could have done the half day program.

670
01:02:06,747 --> 01:02:20,817
[SPEAKER_14]: That was not a requirement per DESE, but we felt very strongly about offering a full day program for working parents and also offering students the opportunity to have two meals and some enrichment with the specialists.

671
01:02:21,978 --> 01:02:30,224
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that outweighs a little bit of, I would like to see it be longer than one week.

672
01:02:31,028 --> 01:02:34,412
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that the full-day programming is important for a lot of our families.

673
01:02:34,892 --> 01:02:35,193
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

674
01:02:35,393 --> 01:02:41,960
[SPEAKER_22]: And so Desi's paying for the meals and the time in the school and all that stuff, right?

675
01:02:43,842 --> 01:02:46,465
[SPEAKER_22]: And they're not covering transportation.

676
01:02:47,406 --> 01:02:49,749
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think that, you know...

677
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:56,510
[SPEAKER_22]: that doesn't mean that we couldn't, I mean, you know, we don't have lots of money laying around, but that doesn't mean we couldn't do it.

678
01:02:57,771 --> 01:03:05,834
[SPEAKER_22]: And so when the invitations go out, I'm assuming there's lots of people who do not accept the invitation.

679
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:07,355
[SPEAKER_22]: Are we asking them why?

680
01:03:07,735 --> 01:03:11,177
[SPEAKER_22]: And is that useful information for planning in the future?

681
01:03:11,197 --> 01:03:13,478
[SPEAKER_14]: We did do that.

682
01:03:13,678 --> 01:03:18,580
[SPEAKER_14]: And so and we had a lot of a lot of the names that were listed on on there.

683
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:22,238
[SPEAKER_14]: did a lot of correspondence and outreach to families.

684
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:26,262
[SPEAKER_14]: And in our survey, we had that question as well.

685
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:35,851
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that the double-edged sword here is that we are very appreciative to the Department of Education for their grant, but the timing of it was late.

686
01:03:38,368 --> 01:03:44,994
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we did hear from some families that they had vacations or they were already enrolled in other camps.

687
01:03:45,415 --> 01:04:01,630
[SPEAKER_14]: We did have a few situations in where a student may have attended, may have missed half of the day because they had something else and we just were very flexible because the timing of the invitation was a little later in the year.

688
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,592
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we were planning,

689
01:04:04,212 --> 01:04:08,995
[SPEAKER_14]: would have been more beneficial to have that at an earlier date.

690
01:04:10,255 --> 01:04:14,158
[SPEAKER_22]: So you're saying Gessie didn't even come out with the grant early enough?

691
01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:17,599
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a later grant.

692
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:18,140
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

693
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

694
01:04:19,921 --> 01:04:20,941
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a later grant.

695
01:04:21,101 --> 01:04:27,065
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you apply, but you have to wait for the response to see if you've been awarded the grant.

696
01:04:27,245 --> 01:04:27,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Got it.

697
01:04:27,645 --> 01:04:28,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

698
01:04:28,345 --> 01:04:28,926
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it's...

699
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:31,870
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

700
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:32,531
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a lot of work.

701
01:04:36,354 --> 01:04:36,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

702
01:04:36,955 --> 01:04:37,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Reinfeld?

703
01:04:37,555 --> 01:04:37,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

704
01:04:39,437 --> 01:04:43,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Remind me from June, this was to cover the program for one year.

705
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:47,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Remind me of the scope.

706
01:04:47,744 --> 01:04:48,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, for the grant?

707
01:04:48,925 --> 01:04:49,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

708
01:04:49,505 --> 01:04:52,488
[SPEAKER_14]: It was literally titled a vacation grant.

709
01:04:52,728 --> 01:04:57,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was the intention of the grant was for vacation weeks.

710
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:01,140
[SPEAKER_14]: or summer, but for one year or one year program.

711
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that's all right.

712
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:04,742
[SPEAKER_10]: So remember Ruseau touched on this.

713
01:05:04,843 --> 01:05:07,284
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the percentage of students who accepted?

714
01:05:08,285 --> 01:05:11,348
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked a lot in June about strategies for outreach.

715
01:05:11,728 --> 01:05:12,769
[SPEAKER_14]: We did, we did.

716
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:17,212
[SPEAKER_14]: So we actually, I can get you the exact number in terms of like a percentile.

717
01:05:19,594 --> 01:05:24,798
[SPEAKER_14]: For the students that we invited, we were quite successful in that, in the students participating.

718
01:05:25,165 --> 01:05:29,728
[SPEAKER_14]: we only, because we did have a tiered approach in terms of the students that we were inviting.

719
01:05:30,028 --> 01:05:34,170
[SPEAKER_14]: So we only had to go to that next tier just a few times.

720
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:44,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I think for me, if I'm looking back at it, the pieces where there was more of that work to do was as we progress in the grades.

721
01:05:44,756 --> 01:05:44,976
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

722
01:05:45,176 --> 01:05:53,981
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had a lot, you know, I don't think we had to really go much further for students in the lower grades, grades one through three, but for...

723
01:05:54,637 --> 01:06:01,941
[SPEAKER_14]: students in the rising grades four to rising grade nine, that took a little bit more correspondence.

724
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:13,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, do we have an opportunity to compare the students who participated with the students who didn't, whether that's through early DIBELS, early MAP, or even qualitative?

725
01:06:14,588 --> 01:06:14,968
[SPEAKER_14]: We do.

726
01:06:15,168 --> 01:06:23,171
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually, so this week started both our DIBELS assessments and our math assessments.

727
01:06:23,231 --> 01:06:25,712
[SPEAKER_14]: So we will have a lot of that preliminary data.

728
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:38,396
[SPEAKER_14]: I think maybe the other piece to an opportunity like this, where it was just one week, even per DIBELS, if we're using that as our benchmark for progress monitoring,

729
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:45,491
[SPEAKER_14]: they suggest, especially for struggling readers, that we're not assessing until after 10 days of instruction.

730
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:51,933
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would have to be, a lot of what we would have to be using is this current benchmark at the beginning of the year.

731
01:06:51,953 --> 01:07:04,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it would just be interesting to see if there was any kind of significant shift in scores comparing, looking across the cohort that was invited, those who participated and those who didn't, assuming they were on similar tiers.

732
01:07:04,577 --> 01:07:04,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

733
01:07:05,247 --> 01:07:05,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

734
01:07:05,607 --> 01:07:10,672
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my last question is, it seems like there was a lot of great teacher feedback about the format and how this works.

735
01:07:11,753 --> 01:07:23,503
[SPEAKER_10]: How can we use the lessons that were learned in this summer experience to apply them or scale them up as we're looking at more intensive literacy training with

736
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Hill and others?

737
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:28,074
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad you asked that question.

738
01:07:28,094 --> 01:07:29,316
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to answer it twofold.

739
01:07:29,996 --> 01:07:43,813
[SPEAKER_14]: First, I would like to say that even some of the teacher feedback from our secondary staff that also worked the fifth quarter, some of that was also in conversations that I've had with Riley Jones and with...

740
01:07:44,538 --> 01:07:45,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Principal Cabral.

741
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:54,603
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a lot of interest to use that model and bring it over to the fifth quarter, especially for middle school students.

742
01:07:55,063 --> 01:08:05,909
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's something that we're working on in terms of like the difference that we kind of saw in some of the data between middle school students that participated in fifth quarter and high school students that participated in fifth quarter.

743
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:13,833
[SPEAKER_14]: But also too, where this is our new, this is our second year in the literacy program

744
01:08:14,511 --> 01:08:27,939
[SPEAKER_14]: And so literacy programs are so massive that we spent every last minute of our PD time last year on literacy and this program, and we still didn't cover it all.

745
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:36,724
[SPEAKER_14]: And so a lot of the focus this year is definitely with Hill and with our school leaders is definitely on that small group instruction.

746
01:08:37,764 --> 01:08:38,565
[SPEAKER_14]: So much so that...

747
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:47,632
[SPEAKER_14]: over the summer, we used teachers from the district literacy leadership team, as well as school leaders.

748
01:08:48,172 --> 01:08:58,357
[SPEAKER_14]: We met in June to really look at our elementary schedule and the teachers worked with their principals over the summer.

749
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:01,278
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were able to not only align the teachers,

750
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:18,703
[SPEAKER_14]: the elementary schedules across the district, but our real primary focus was on that literacy block and ensuring that our students are present for tier one instruction and not forced to have to be removed from the classroom for their services.

751
01:09:19,183 --> 01:09:24,726
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were able to really look at our literacy blocks, K to five,

752
01:09:25,379 --> 01:09:38,247
[SPEAKER_14]: and ensure separate times so that students have that tier one instruction, they're part of that small group instruction, and that services are provided at different opportunities so students aren't sacrificing any of that.

753
01:09:38,267 --> 01:09:43,891
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a very big focus of the literacy instruction this year is that small group instruction.

754
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:54,718
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when Hill comes around this year, our focus with Hill this year is on, they're gonna be coming into the schools once a month, each building, and they're going to be working

755
01:09:55,606 --> 01:09:58,089
[SPEAKER_14]: on that piece of the implementation of the program.

756
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:06,198
[SPEAKER_14]: And part of that is going to be focused on the ECRI, the small group instruction, and as well as the tier one whole group time.

757
01:10:07,299 --> 01:10:09,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it affect the tier two model as well?

758
01:10:11,884 --> 01:10:13,666
[SPEAKER_14]: The coaching or the schedule?

759
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:15,708
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess both.

760
01:10:17,293 --> 01:10:38,506
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we were finding and the reason that really precipitated having this summer work is that we have a lot of students, and especially in our Title I buildings of the McGlynn and the Missatuck, there's a lot of students that are duly identified, maybe triply identified, and they need to have multiple services.

761
01:10:39,732 --> 01:10:43,075
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be special education, EL, related services.

762
01:10:43,776 --> 01:10:48,660
[SPEAKER_14]: And too often students were missing that tier one time with their peers.

763
01:10:49,421 --> 01:10:56,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we wanted to make that sacred so that students are learning alongside with their peers.

764
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:04,314
[SPEAKER_14]: They have time with their teacher in small group instruction, as well as having to leave the room for small group instruction.

765
01:11:04,854 --> 01:11:06,256
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we were able to

766
01:11:06,872 --> 01:11:23,339
[SPEAKER_14]: the elementary principals with myself and Dr. Chiesa and the literacy coaches and the teachers on the DLLT, the district leadership team that worked on this all summer, we were able to create more aligned schedules to meet those needs.

767
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:24,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

768
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:25,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

769
01:11:28,221 --> 01:11:28,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham?

770
01:11:29,522 --> 01:11:31,023
[SPEAKER_07]: How much was the grant from DESE?

771
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:33,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Roughly.

772
01:11:37,358 --> 01:11:38,379
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to misquote.

773
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:40,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Is Dr. Keyes on the call?

774
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:41,361
[SPEAKER_14]: I am.

775
01:11:43,423 --> 01:11:45,865
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, I'm going to toss this to you, Dr. Keyes.

776
01:11:45,945 --> 01:11:47,987
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it was approximately $40,000.

777
01:11:48,627 --> 01:11:52,070
[SPEAKER_00]: It just varied based on how many student participants.

778
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:53,191
[SPEAKER_00]: It was around that amount.

779
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:56,354
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get you the final amount, but that was the general time frame.

780
01:11:56,374 --> 01:11:59,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, general amount.

781
01:12:00,137 --> 01:11:59,757
$40,000.

782
01:12:00,197 --> 01:12:00,858
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you.

783
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:01,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.

784
01:12:02,659 --> 01:12:04,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've done this before.

785
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And how did we pay for it in the past?

786
01:12:08,921 --> 01:12:14,962
[SPEAKER_14]: So that we've had, before we did get a DESE grant, but we've also used ESSER.

787
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:15,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

788
01:12:17,263 --> 01:12:22,104
[SPEAKER_07]: And is it a grant that comes around every year or not necessarily?

789
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:23,464
[SPEAKER_07]: We have our fingers crossed.

790
01:12:23,724 --> 01:12:24,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

791
01:12:25,645 --> 01:12:25,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Got it.

792
01:12:25,845 --> 01:12:34,407
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would like to be, I would like to, in conversations with Dr. Chiesa and the literacy coaches,

793
01:12:35,546 --> 01:12:39,527
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we would also like to see if there's other ways to fund the expansion.

794
01:12:39,908 --> 01:12:53,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Because even if this comes up again, if we were to offer it with the same format and at the same level of staffing, we would need to supplement that to expand it beyond that one week.

795
01:12:56,053 --> 01:12:56,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

796
01:12:56,653 --> 01:13:03,956
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just helpful to know as we ultimately think about the budget and what needs to go in the budget, particularly because

797
01:13:04,522 --> 01:13:11,664
[SPEAKER_07]: planning for this, if we're doing it in advance, is going to pre-date, you know, precede any sort of budget hearings and approvals and all of that.

798
01:13:11,744 --> 01:13:20,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you're ready to present a proposal, please do so that we can figure out how to handle that proactively.

799
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:21,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

800
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:22,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

801
01:13:26,247 --> 01:13:26,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

802
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:34,936
[SPEAKER_14]: So Director Fee, moving on to the last part of this presentation, and I am saddened she couldn't be here.

803
01:13:35,016 --> 01:13:39,099
[SPEAKER_14]: She's very dedicated and has done such a fabulous job.

804
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,941
[SPEAKER_14]: She did not have a summer.

805
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:55,518
[SPEAKER_14]: because Director Fee has spent the summer securing our brand new band director, who's fabulous, Michael Dampier, and making sure that these programs went off without a hitch.

806
01:13:55,538 --> 01:14:00,442
[SPEAKER_14]: So started during COVID was the Jumpstart Music Program to try to re-energize.

807
01:14:00,622 --> 01:14:02,364
[SPEAKER_14]: That has now become an annual staple.

808
01:14:02,924 --> 01:14:06,047
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the Jumpstart Music Program was very successful.

809
01:14:06,127 --> 01:14:07,408
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a two-week program.

810
01:14:08,268 --> 01:14:19,815
[SPEAKER_14]: for rising students in grades four through eight as a way to either continue their music instruction or if they were interested in chatting with friends, get them involved.

811
01:14:19,835 --> 01:14:24,277
[SPEAKER_14]: There were over 80 students that participated in the Jumpstart music program.

812
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:31,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Our brand new band director and music teacher, Michael Dampier was there as well as Emma Baptist, Sophia Chang.

813
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:34,843
[SPEAKER_14]: And we even had high school students

814
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:54,125
[SPEAKER_14]: students that were volunteering and helping with the younger students i think it's very important to note that there were very various string and percussion instruments that were given to students free of charge so that they could participate in this program although some families did opt to purchase the programs it was

815
01:14:55,003 --> 01:14:55,624
[SPEAKER_14]: up to the family.

816
01:14:56,184 --> 01:15:01,889
[SPEAKER_14]: For the first time this year as part of Jumpstart Music, we were able to include a color guard section.

817
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:07,154
[SPEAKER_14]: So there were students in rising, I believe they were rising fifth and sixth graders.

818
01:15:09,036 --> 01:15:11,578
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had, excuse me.

819
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:13,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there were.

820
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:13,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

821
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:14,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that.

822
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:16,921
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was wonderful.

823
01:15:17,121 --> 01:15:31,464
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the end of the program, they did, on the final day, they did do a performance so that the orchestra and the band and the color guard gave a wonderful performance to caregivers and other people that were working up at the high school that day.

824
01:15:31,484 --> 01:15:33,685
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a wonderful addition.

825
01:15:35,465 --> 01:15:38,626
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's important to note that a lot of...

826
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:44,142
[SPEAKER_14]: The coordination was also with the Banned Parent Organization.

827
01:15:44,162 --> 01:15:50,167
[SPEAKER_14]: They've worked tirelessly this summer and very closely with Director Fee and Medford Public Schools.

828
01:15:50,227 --> 01:15:52,389
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we're very appreciative of them.

829
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:55,792
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were able to also secure a Tufts grant to help with that.

830
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:02,704
[SPEAKER_14]: And then for the first time, Director Fee also had a summer art program.

831
01:16:03,365 --> 01:16:07,808
[SPEAKER_14]: And so this was free of charge for this first annual year.

832
01:16:08,228 --> 01:16:14,492
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was funded by the Medford Arts Council, the Cummings Foundation, and the City of Medford Community Fund.

833
01:16:15,493 --> 01:16:19,074
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a pilot program, but it was very, very successful.

834
01:16:19,534 --> 01:16:33,598
[SPEAKER_14]: High school students, there were about 12 students that participated at the high school level, and they did a studio week on self-directed projects, and everything was connected to social issues that were important to the students.

835
01:16:34,718 --> 01:16:40,000
[SPEAKER_14]: They created ceramic pieces, cardboard sculptures, paintings, drawings, and more.

836
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:45,021
[SPEAKER_14]: For students in grades four through eight, there were 30 students that participated.

837
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:54,603
[SPEAKER_14]: They learned and practiced different skills and techniques and applied them to personal projects that reflected a social issue of their choice.

838
01:16:55,204 --> 01:17:00,585
[SPEAKER_14]: And then for students in grades one through three, approximately 25 students participated there.

839
01:17:00,605 --> 01:17:08,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And they spent the week using just exploring different art materials and learning around the themes of kindness.

840
01:17:10,694 --> 01:17:18,381
[SPEAKER_14]: You will see on this last slide, there's just a few pictures that Director Fee included from the workshop.

841
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:33,093
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, as with all programming this summer, would not be possible without the dedication and commitment of teachers and community.

842
01:17:34,134 --> 01:17:36,356
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually had community members helping as well.

843
01:17:39,059 --> 01:17:41,721
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you, if you have any questions, I can attempt.

844
01:17:43,122 --> 01:17:45,584
[SPEAKER_13]: No, thank you for doing a great job with Ms.

845
01:17:45,604 --> 01:17:46,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Fee's presentation.

846
01:17:46,604 --> 01:17:47,305
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you to Ms.

847
01:17:47,325 --> 01:17:48,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Fee for all the hard work.

848
01:17:48,866 --> 01:17:49,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rousseau?

849
01:17:49,806 --> 01:17:55,771
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to thank all of the staff and teachers that have spent their whole summer doing all this stuff.

850
01:17:56,131 --> 01:17:59,653
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of this stuff happened in places that weren't the coolest facilities either.

851
01:17:59,673 --> 01:18:04,657
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's one thing to spend your summer working with kids.

852
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:08,708
[SPEAKER_22]: it's another to do it when it's too damn hot in the buildings.

853
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:17,352
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you to all of the, too many people to list, but thank you to all of this wonderful staff and the administration for making it happen too.

854
01:18:18,112 --> 01:18:18,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that.

855
01:18:18,993 --> 01:18:28,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do think it's important with all that programming, if you added up all of the staff and the educators that participated to make this possible for students, it's a lot.

856
01:18:29,157 --> 01:18:31,038
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we're greatly appreciative of that.

857
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, yes, thank you.

858
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

859
01:18:33,221 --> 01:18:34,061
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to go far.

860
01:18:34,101 --> 01:18:38,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I think next step you're getting to report on personnel and enrollment.

861
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:41,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Guzzi.

862
01:18:41,646 --> 01:18:41,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

863
01:18:41,966 --> 01:18:46,168
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you.

864
01:18:46,509 --> 01:18:48,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Cushing is just going to present.

865
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:56,935
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you had in your packets just a basic overview of the enrollment so far for Metro Public Schools.

866
01:18:59,306 --> 01:19:09,548
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you've probably heard this before, but I just have to reiterate how fluid of a situation enrollment and personnel is at this time of year.

867
01:19:09,568 --> 01:19:17,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Our reporting to DESE is always the first, October 1st.

868
01:19:17,689 --> 01:19:21,850
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there's a lot that's happening between now and October 1st.

869
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:26,211
[SPEAKER_14]: So much so that even the, Dr. Cushing, you may go to the next slide.

870
01:19:26,741 --> 01:19:33,765
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe in your packets on Friday, you received this as an overall enrollment view.

871
01:19:34,305 --> 01:19:40,048
[SPEAKER_14]: And so one of the things that I just want to explain is it's a slightly different format than what you're used to seeing.

872
01:19:40,949 --> 01:19:49,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Our data analyst Kim Miles works tirelessly always, but especially this time of year, constantly updating this for us.

873
01:19:49,954 --> 01:19:53,916
[SPEAKER_14]: And so one of the things you'll see in the far right is something that's called TBD.

874
01:19:56,112 --> 01:19:58,213
[SPEAKER_14]: and it doesn't reflect a specific school.

875
01:19:58,353 --> 01:20:06,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what happens at this time of year is that there's a lot of students whose registrations are not complete, and that's for various reasons.

876
01:20:06,536 --> 01:20:12,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they may not have been assigned to a school yet, which is why things are constantly changing.

877
01:20:13,319 --> 01:20:19,621
[SPEAKER_14]: That could be for, it could be medically pending, and it's with Nurse Director Jen Silva.

878
01:20:19,821 --> 01:20:20,901
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be EL, and...

879
01:20:23,243 --> 01:20:44,037
[SPEAKER_14]: there may be some testing with Director Paul Texterra's department, or it just may be that they have not followed back up and have chosen not to come to Medford Public Schools, or there may be another registration hang-up in which the registration office is following up with phone calls to try and assist and see what's going on.

880
01:20:44,577 --> 01:20:49,040
[SPEAKER_14]: So over the weekend, if you just advance, please, Dr. Cushing, to the next slide.

881
01:20:51,124 --> 01:20:58,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Kim Miles had sent this because, again, over the weekend, she was working on cleaning up some of the information.

882
01:20:58,129 --> 01:20:59,891
[SPEAKER_14]: And so this was of yesterday.

883
01:20:59,911 --> 01:21:03,313
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is the most current information that we have.

884
01:21:03,353 --> 01:21:17,845
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll see a shift in the total enrollment because she was cleaning out and making sure that it was accurate in terms of students that have moved on or decided.

885
01:21:18,565 --> 01:21:21,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

886
01:21:22,382 --> 01:21:38,440
[SPEAKER_14]: um and so this is a more current view of the enrollment right now for the district i'm not quite yeah do you have any questions before i move to personnel yes member rousseau

887
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:46,907
[SPEAKER_22]: Could you just send line CC to the school committee when the October 1 report goes to DESE?

888
01:21:47,527 --> 01:21:58,390
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's not gonna look terribly different, but it's good to have, you know, I keep these reports, but I also know that there are so many of these reports that they're not the important reports, so.

889
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,970
[SPEAKER_14]: It's preliminary right now, correct.

890
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:01,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

891
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:01,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

892
01:22:04,631 --> 01:22:04,931
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor.

893
01:22:06,812 --> 01:22:07,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Olapade.

894
01:22:08,318 --> 01:22:08,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

895
01:22:09,038 --> 01:22:23,282
[SPEAKER_18]: For the high school enrollment data, is it possible for us, it doesn't have to be, obviously, right this moment, but could we have the Medford High block separate to the Medford High plus the vocational program, just so that we understand how those numbers are changing for the current time?

896
01:22:23,302 --> 01:22:24,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that possible?

897
01:22:25,082 --> 01:22:26,203
[SPEAKER_14]: That is possible, yes.

898
01:22:27,003 --> 01:22:27,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

899
01:22:28,263 --> 01:22:28,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor?

900
01:22:29,523 --> 01:22:30,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Member Brindley.

901
01:22:30,544 --> 01:22:30,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

902
01:22:31,804 --> 01:22:34,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we get a regular update on enrollment?

903
01:22:35,025 --> 01:22:35,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Monthly, quarterly?

904
01:22:36,707 --> 01:22:38,848
[SPEAKER_08]: somewhere just to see how our numbers are staying.

905
01:22:39,749 --> 01:22:39,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

906
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:41,430
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean this report?

907
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:41,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

908
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:42,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

909
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a little bit regularly.

910
01:22:43,951 --> 01:22:49,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so, you know, even if it was like January 1st or come the spring, just to see where we stand.

911
01:22:49,955 --> 01:23:00,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just, I don't know if there's a time for that, but just curious with, you know, cuts that we made and budget issues, you know, are we being supported properly?

912
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:05,644
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, nurse guidance, all the things that we worried about back in May and June, some of those things haven't changed.

913
01:23:05,684 --> 01:23:05,804
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

914
01:23:06,503 --> 01:23:15,330
[SPEAKER_08]: concerns me with some of the numbers so i just want to make sure that we're where we're supposed to be thank you no problem member graham

915
01:23:16,761 --> 01:23:23,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the other thing that's important to call out here is the huge disparity in enrollment at our elementary schools.

916
01:23:26,685 --> 01:23:29,526
[SPEAKER_07]: In my mind, it was always like about 100 kids different.

917
01:23:30,146 --> 01:23:36,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's like pushing 200 students different between the Roberts and the Missatuck.

918
01:23:37,288 --> 01:23:40,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost 150 between Brooks and Missatuck.

919
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:43,891
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to point that out.

920
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:53,878
[SPEAKER_07]: to do a couple of things, but one is to put on our radar collectively that like we can't, the gap can't keep widening.

921
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:58,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we have to do something different than we're doing today.

922
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:01,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've talked to people about this a lot.

923
01:24:02,225 --> 01:24:15,135
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not an easy, obvious answer short of like picking a bunch of kids up who live at the McGlynn basically and sending them to the Missatuck or picking a bunch of kids up that live next door to the Brooks and sending them to Missatuck.

924
01:24:16,041 --> 01:24:25,310
[SPEAKER_07]: because of the sort of placement of the Missatuck building in the city, there's sort of less that you can draw from to add to those numbers.

925
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:31,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know it's a huge challenge, but I don't think we can continue to like operate in this fashion.

926
01:24:31,976 --> 01:24:33,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to do something.

927
01:24:37,361 --> 01:24:38,722
[SPEAKER_14]: I can respond after you comment.

928
01:24:40,387 --> 01:25:05,395
[SPEAKER_14]: that i would 100 agree um i've had several conversations with principal kroll i don't know if she wants to come up here um but one of the conversations we've had because again the roberts is the only kindergarten is the only school where we had to add yet another fifth section for kindergarten and their numbers are at a hundred um

929
01:25:06,952 --> 01:25:35,403
[SPEAKER_14]: within her schedule so like the specialist schedules students go for their specials there is no more space in her schedule let's say if we had an influx and we had to add another section somewhere in her school there's no more room within the existing schedule so it's a it's a it is a big issue that we definitely have to address um quite quickly

930
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:40,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

931
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:53,565
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm putting it on my list for the budget season because options are the ever nightmarish redistricting, which is not a permanent solution.

932
01:25:53,625 --> 01:26:01,829
[SPEAKER_22]: It's sort of like in my mind, it's like a 10 year solution because people who think that they need to go to a specific school will simply buy a house in that district.

933
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:08,332
[SPEAKER_22]: It will be a painful experience for people who bought a house near a specific school

934
01:26:09,403 --> 01:26:11,164
[SPEAKER_22]: knowing that that's where their kid was gonna go.

935
01:26:11,284 --> 01:26:14,446
[SPEAKER_22]: And then they go to register and they find out that's not where their kid's gonna go.

936
01:26:15,646 --> 01:26:26,672
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I mean, every district that has ever redistricted, it's not a good experience for the process, but it's necessary.

937
01:26:28,493 --> 01:26:34,957
[SPEAKER_22]: In my time on the school committee, we have moved programs all over the city because for one reason only,

938
01:26:36,001 --> 01:26:38,783
[SPEAKER_22]: the Roberts was too full or the Brooks was too full.

939
01:26:39,243 --> 01:26:41,285
[SPEAKER_22]: We were never doing it because it was right for kids.

940
01:26:42,685 --> 01:26:45,127
[SPEAKER_22]: It was always, we were just too full.

941
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:48,910
[SPEAKER_22]: And so, you know, some kids ended up on buses.

942
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:51,611
[SPEAKER_22]: The newcomers program has been all over the place.

943
01:26:54,895 --> 01:26:58,917
[SPEAKER_22]: making decisions that are right for the kids should be how we're approaching these things.

944
01:26:58,977 --> 01:27:06,401
[SPEAKER_22]: But that does also mean we're going to have to all experience some pain in redistricting if that's what we decide to do.

945
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:17,386
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm adding it to my list, my short list of things for us to consider budgeting for in the upcoming year, because it isn't like we just get a map out and just start drawing.

946
01:27:17,426 --> 01:27:21,048
[SPEAKER_22]: You hire a company, a consultant who is specialized.

947
01:27:21,068 --> 01:27:24,029
[SPEAKER_22]: There are consultants that specialize in exactly this thing.

948
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:32,915
[SPEAKER_22]: and they figure out things like what happens to busing and like you draw the line here and all there's these three new babies that were born this week on that street.

949
01:27:32,955 --> 01:27:34,596
[SPEAKER_22]: Like they do all that hard work.

950
01:27:36,256 --> 01:27:43,800
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think we're long past the need to do that because we have to do what's right for kids.

951
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:52,984
[SPEAKER_22]: And if the Roberts is literally, I mean, the scenario of like a bunch of new people just move in,

952
01:27:54,167 --> 01:28:01,815
[SPEAKER_22]: to that district that we're in bad, bad situation in that case.

953
01:28:01,835 --> 01:28:09,062
[SPEAKER_22]: Because if we decide those new kids have to go to another school, well, they might live right beside the Roberts.

954
01:28:09,543 --> 01:28:15,989
[SPEAKER_22]: And meanwhile, people who are really far from the Roberts, right at the edge, they're getting bused to the Roberts.

955
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:26,924
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not tenable to just avoid this very challenging and politically very unfun experience, because as you said, we're maxed out.

956
01:28:28,205 --> 01:28:29,906
[SPEAKER_22]: And there are other things.

957
01:28:29,926 --> 01:28:36,790
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, not that I don't think the principals all do great jobs, but we have principals making about the same amount of money.

958
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:37,850
[SPEAKER_22]: One has 177 more students to manage.

959
01:28:41,617 --> 01:28:43,718
[SPEAKER_22]: and I don't think they should get paid differently.

960
01:28:43,759 --> 01:28:45,380
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we should resolve that problem.

961
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:51,944
[SPEAKER_22]: So, well, I guess we'll be talking about that more soon because we can't keep going.

962
01:28:52,404 --> 01:28:52,724
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

963
01:28:53,305 --> 01:28:53,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

964
01:28:53,705 --> 01:29:02,370
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so lastly, I'm just going to give a very broad overview of personnel.

965
01:29:03,951 --> 01:29:07,614
[SPEAKER_14]: To date, we've hired, again, this is also fluid.

966
01:29:08,094 --> 01:29:09,215
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have had people,

967
01:29:10,777 --> 01:29:15,581
[SPEAKER_14]: resign or retire as early as this week or last week.

968
01:29:17,423 --> 01:29:23,108
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, but in total, we have hired around 44-ish teachers.

969
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:26,451
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have a new literacy coach.

970
01:29:27,132 --> 01:29:29,214
[SPEAKER_14]: We did have two new literacy coaches, but...

971
01:29:30,146 --> 01:29:31,887
[SPEAKER_14]: One was part of the resignation.

972
01:29:32,988 --> 01:29:40,712
[SPEAKER_14]: But we've had new literacy coaches, adjustment counselors, behavior therapists, educational team leaders, a new carpentry teacher.

973
01:29:41,673 --> 01:29:48,197
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a new nurse to help with the Brooks and the Andrews school communities.

974
01:29:48,957 --> 01:29:57,202
[SPEAKER_14]: We have an engagement specialist for Medford Public Schools, who just started today, which is wonderful, and a new payroll manager.

975
01:29:58,362 --> 01:30:02,144
[SPEAKER_14]: And also in total, we have about nine new paraprofessionals.

976
01:30:03,405 --> 01:30:07,387
[SPEAKER_14]: But there are still some vacancies in areas in where we are hiring.

977
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:11,189
[SPEAKER_14]: There's still about, and I use that about, 20.

978
01:30:12,552 --> 01:30:33,265
[SPEAKER_14]: open teaching positions, but please note that those range from specialized instruction to long-term substitute needs, because we do have staff that have reasons for absences that we have to cover with long-term solutions.

979
01:30:34,005 --> 01:30:38,708
[SPEAKER_14]: And we still have about, I think, just three paraprofessional positions to fill.

980
01:30:42,264 --> 01:30:45,826
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you have any questions broadly about personnel.

981
01:30:46,786 --> 01:30:47,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Branley?

982
01:30:47,447 --> 01:30:48,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we just have a copy of that?

983
01:30:48,647 --> 01:30:49,648
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not in our packet.

984
01:30:49,668 --> 01:30:49,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

985
01:30:49,908 --> 01:30:50,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Those two pages with the personnel.

986
01:30:50,888 --> 01:30:51,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

987
01:30:51,749 --> 01:30:54,050
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was, no, it's in the drive.

988
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:56,851
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'll make a, I can do a print copy.

989
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:57,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yes, yes.

990
01:30:59,512 --> 01:30:59,773
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

991
01:31:00,173 --> 01:31:00,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

992
01:31:01,233 --> 01:31:01,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

993
01:31:03,394 --> 01:31:03,654
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor?

994
01:31:04,595 --> 01:31:05,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rousseau?

995
01:31:05,255 --> 01:31:08,037
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe that there's some members of the public who want to speak on this.

996
01:31:08,297 --> 01:31:08,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

997
01:31:12,503 --> 01:31:13,805
[SPEAKER_13]: name and address for the record, Ms.

998
01:31:13,825 --> 01:31:14,066
[SPEAKER_13]: McKay.

999
01:31:22,014 --> 01:31:22,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, can you hear me?

1000
01:31:23,976 --> 01:31:24,997
[SPEAKER_03]: You thought you were rid of me, right?

1001
01:31:26,178 --> 01:31:27,298
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I come in peace.

1002
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:35,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually, which is not always how I've come in the past.

1003
01:31:35,204 --> 01:31:39,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is actually following up on what Mr. Russo just said.

1004
01:31:39,187 --> 01:31:43,751
[SPEAKER_03]: So myself, another teacher from the Roberts tonight and a few that are online.

1005
01:31:44,511 --> 01:31:52,215
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here tonight to ask you to consider starting a process of redistricting the elementary school for the 2025-26 school year.

1006
01:31:52,975 --> 01:31:58,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, we do have elementary schools that are overcrowded while some schools are under capacity.

1007
01:31:58,878 --> 01:32:03,760
[SPEAKER_03]: The Roberts Elementary School currently has 594 students enrolled.

1008
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:06,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Dr. Galusi said, that might be fluid from when I wrote this.

1009
01:32:07,182 --> 01:32:12,665
[SPEAKER_03]: At this time, second only to Medford Vocational Technical High School, we are the largest school in Medford.

1010
01:32:13,465 --> 01:32:32,141
[SPEAKER_03]: our school currently houses two meet preschool classrooms five connections classrooms and 27 regular education classrooms we have five kindergarten first and third grade classrooms and four second fourth and fifth grade classrooms currently our second grade enrollment is borderline for needing five classrooms

1011
01:32:33,365 --> 01:32:36,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Our building is at full capacity without room for any more.

1012
01:32:37,207 --> 01:32:49,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Our school required a major restructuring of space this summer to accommodate all of the grade level classrooms, as well as spaces for our reading specialists, adjustment counselors, speech, OT, PT, and special education classrooms.

1013
01:32:50,272 --> 01:32:55,494
[SPEAKER_03]: There's currently not one open space available in our school with some teachers having to double up.

1014
01:32:56,693 --> 01:33:05,978
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the website mass.gov, in 2021, Massachusetts had 69,127 live births, which was a 4% increase from 2020.

1015
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:13,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year is the year that this is going to impact our schools as the children will begin entering kindergarten.

1016
01:33:13,542 --> 01:33:21,107
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see this impact for the next two years and are anticipating that we will continue to need five kindergarten classrooms at the Roberts Elementary School.

1017
01:33:21,807 --> 01:33:46,722
[SPEAKER_03]: logically when there is a large number of kindergarten classrooms at a school the trend of needing five classrooms per grade level continues up throughout the grades as is the current situation we find ourselves in we can expect that next year we will need five fourth grades and the following year we'll need five fifth grades if more second graders move in we may possibly even need five second grade classrooms and we simply do not have the physical space within our building for this

1018
01:33:47,574 --> 01:33:52,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently grade levels with only four classrooms per grade level have a large amount of students in each classroom.

1019
01:33:52,998 --> 01:33:55,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have students that are arriving daily.

1020
01:33:56,241 --> 01:33:59,804
[SPEAKER_03]: We feel that it is necessary for Medford to begin redistricting the schools.

1021
01:34:00,405 --> 01:34:04,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Redistricting allows the schools to be balanced, which creates equity in learning.

1022
01:34:04,888 --> 01:34:07,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We want all children to have access to an equal education.

1023
01:34:07,731 --> 01:34:12,615
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be able to meet the needs of our students in a balanced and fair educational system.

1024
01:34:13,095 --> 01:34:16,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are asking you to please consider this matter.

1025
01:34:16,838 --> 01:34:22,520
[SPEAKER_03]: and create a plan to redistrict our schools so that we can fairly and safely educate the children in Medford.

1026
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:23,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1027
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:25,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

1028
01:34:25,381 --> 01:34:25,681
[SPEAKER_13]: McKay.

1029
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Heard loud and clear.

1030
01:34:32,463 --> 01:34:35,584
[SPEAKER_10]: May I ask what that looks like?

1031
01:34:35,684 --> 01:34:37,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that initiated by school committee?

1032
01:34:37,404 --> 01:34:38,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that initiated by the district?

1033
01:34:50,106 --> 01:34:58,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I can echo, there is no room in the end, no room in the cafeteria at the Roberts, everywhere is packed.

1034
01:34:59,614 --> 01:35:07,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Roberts has the smallest playground structure of all of the, just where they're physically located, they're landlocked.

1035
01:35:08,021 --> 01:35:09,522
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no room.

1036
01:35:10,582 --> 01:35:12,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really need to do something.

1037
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:19,966
[SPEAKER_02]: But where the Roberts is located is also where we have the most triple deckers, the most apartment buildings along the Fellsway.

1038
01:35:20,587 --> 01:35:25,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is where we have a heavy, heavy concentration of families.

1039
01:35:25,509 --> 01:35:28,030
[SPEAKER_10]: And the population is changing a lot in Fulton Heights.

1040
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:28,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1041
01:35:30,818 --> 01:35:37,864
[SPEAKER_13]: I think whether it's redistricting or other options, there are things being explored behind the scenes, I know by admin.

1042
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:47,030
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm sure you're creating a plan and we're gonna bring that to us, whether it be redistricting or X, Y, and Z, because something obviously needs to be done.

1043
01:35:48,171 --> 01:35:51,554
[SPEAKER_13]: This has been an issue for several years, the Roberts that I'm aware of.

1044
01:35:56,297 --> 01:35:57,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

1045
01:35:59,446 --> 01:36:08,171
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that we've been working on through the MSBA process is working with MSBA to certify our enrollment projection for Medford High.

1046
01:36:08,771 --> 01:36:16,835
[SPEAKER_07]: That enrollment projection when we sort of get to agreement is how we will decide how big the school becomes.

1047
01:36:16,935 --> 01:36:24,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've had to actually do a lot of really like interesting and fascinating work around like future projected enrollment.

1048
01:36:24,219 --> 01:36:27,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have to give them information about like

1049
01:36:27,975 --> 01:36:33,059
[SPEAKER_07]: our live births and we have to give them information about projected housing.

1050
01:36:33,399 --> 01:36:36,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's been a whole slew of information we've had to provide to them.

1051
01:36:37,683 --> 01:36:48,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I am working to make it a little bit more digestible because you have to submit everything into this system and it makes it really hard to extract it in a way that it makes sense.

1052
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:53,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am working on something to be able to put on the website so people can see that.

1053
01:36:53,636 --> 01:36:56,658
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's been sort of an interesting conversation with

1054
01:36:57,604 --> 01:37:07,532
[SPEAKER_07]: folks at city hall about like what is actually coming down the pike from a housing perspective and housing production goals and all of that good stuff.

1055
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:22,624
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the other thing that I would say is I would love for the city staff to be watching carefully when real estate in the Roberts neighborhood, like directly adjacent becomes available because there is no way out of the parking situation over there.

1056
01:37:22,664 --> 01:37:26,487
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's no way out of the playground situation without more space.

1057
01:37:27,122 --> 01:37:48,495
[SPEAKER_07]: so i do think the city needs to do something seriously to address that because you can't there are 200 more kids trying to use that playground than trying to use the two playgrounds at missituck and a giant field so there's and there's just literally not time to walk to hickey park for recess every single day so

1058
01:37:49,111 --> 01:37:59,378
[SPEAKER_07]: something has to give there, whether that building becomes drastically smaller in enrollment because of the space constraints, or we try to address the space constraints.

1059
01:37:59,398 --> 01:38:07,443
[SPEAKER_07]: There's probably a bunch of facets there, some of which are in our control and some of which are probably more city controlled sort of.

1060
01:38:08,491 --> 01:38:31,673
[SPEAKER_07]: endeavors and decisions so i think we need to look at all of that when we think about distributing what's a reasonable time frame to get that kind of report of what that looks like or what models are being considered the enrollment projection report probably within a month or so i will have that up online for everybody because it is a document that we can share um

1061
01:38:32,921 --> 01:38:35,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So that piece is easy enough to provide.

1062
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:38,665
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sort of, it's a formatting mess.

1063
01:38:38,725 --> 01:38:43,628
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's going to be really hard for people to digest the way that it sort of gets extracted from the system right now.

1064
01:38:44,589 --> 01:39:00,779
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of like that bigger conversation about what happens next, I'll defer to the superintendent, but I would imagine we have to have some meetings where we talk about like what even our goals would be for that kind of conversation, because something like that could start like this big and it could end up this big.

1065
01:39:01,343 --> 01:39:03,144
[SPEAKER_07]: and it could go in any sort of direction.

1066
01:39:03,164 --> 01:39:08,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So we might want to think about sort of putting some parameters around what we're trying to accomplish.

1067
01:39:08,267 --> 01:39:11,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a special meeting of this body?

1068
01:39:11,489 --> 01:39:13,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a strategic planning group?

1069
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:20,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we could maybe do it either way, but I would think it's maybe a committee of the whole because it's such a big project.

1070
01:39:22,736 --> 01:39:27,659
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully some ideas will be brought to the entire committee within the next month or two.

1071
01:39:28,118 --> 01:39:41,781
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry superintendent i cut you off if you were gonna address i just was gonna say it it definitely the the data for the msba which member graham was just mentioning and um really trying to

1072
01:39:44,144 --> 01:39:49,448
[SPEAKER_02]: There are easy solutions where you say you need a bigger building, but we're trying to focus on the high school.

1073
01:39:49,848 --> 01:40:04,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't necessarily talk about another building, but how we could either look at different programs, which member Ruseau made mention of that our EL program has traveled to every single elementary school at one point or another.

1074
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:08,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have had to make programming shifts as well.

1075
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:25,807
[SPEAKER_02]: so all of all of the above is something that we would have to look at specialized programs what are the numbers and um how can we do it in an equitable fashion but um the roberts situation we we are definitely aware that we need to

1076
01:40:26,977 --> 01:40:29,719
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to start at least trying to come up with a game plan.

1077
01:40:30,379 --> 01:40:43,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think once we have that, the final numbers from the MSBA, the enrollment projections to engage the community, the staff in being part of that process.

1078
01:40:45,567 --> 01:40:52,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would love to see that committee of the whole meeting happen this fall once those numbers are presented.

1079
01:40:52,391 --> 01:40:55,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1080
01:40:58,121 --> 01:41:13,428
[SPEAKER_13]: going to invite dr cushing assistant superintendent schools up for our last report which is a report on operations good evening once again madam mayor members of the school committee uh it is just the written report tonight i don't have a presentation

1081
01:41:14,473 --> 01:41:23,095
[SPEAKER_20]: I do welcome you to come and see a lot of the shiny new equipment in our cafeterias or throughout the district that we've been able to procure as I move through this.

1082
01:41:24,355 --> 01:41:31,697
[SPEAKER_20]: So as this report goes on, there are two specific requests that I'd be seeking approval for this evening.

1083
01:41:32,617 --> 01:41:39,839
[SPEAKER_20]: The first I'll tailor a little bit more narrowly than in the written report as it pertains to the Brooks.

1084
01:41:40,959 --> 01:41:41,179
[SPEAKER_20]: Second.

1085
01:41:42,694 --> 01:41:44,755
[SPEAKER_20]: It is, hold on, sorry.

1086
01:41:45,815 --> 01:41:49,296
[SPEAKER_23]: It went off.

1087
01:42:05,563 --> 01:42:12,228
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the last of the five original hot water heaters and it failed in May of 2024.

1088
01:42:12,448 --> 01:42:20,715
[SPEAKER_20]: We looked at doing an emergency procurement for it and just coming and having a plumbing company replace it.

1089
01:42:20,975 --> 01:42:27,060
[SPEAKER_20]: However, in looking at our sustainability goals and looking at best practices for how we should do things,

1090
01:42:28,361 --> 01:42:45,742
[SPEAKER_20]: I hit pause on that as we were able to mitigate some of the concerns without having hot water with chemical cleaners, hand sanitizer, installing a four-gallon, if I'm remembering correctly, hot water heater for hand washing in the kitchen, and doing some other mitigating strategies.

1091
01:42:46,523 --> 01:43:02,120
[SPEAKER_20]: um so uh member rousseau had sent a um some questions that are in here as pertains to this if any other members have further questions on this i'm happy to submit them to the engineering company as i said back in

1092
01:43:02,941 --> 01:43:19,031
[SPEAKER_20]: the springtime there are a lot of things i'm good at i can't answer engineering questions on hvac to only a limited to beyond a limited degree the our goal was to do something that was fully electric unfortunately as i mentioned earlier this evening

1093
01:43:19,931 --> 01:43:22,673
[SPEAKER_20]: The costs are extraordinarily high.

1094
01:43:22,894 --> 01:43:25,896
[SPEAKER_20]: It also requires significant upgrades.

1095
01:43:26,096 --> 01:43:27,217
[SPEAKER_20]: I did not mention this earlier.

1096
01:43:27,237 --> 01:43:38,105
[SPEAKER_20]: It requires significant upgrades to the transformer capacity exterior of the building in the area that I believe that's in the neighborhood of $150,000 inclusive of the $349,000 price.

1097
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:41,227
[SPEAKER_20]: Those pieces of equipment would not be ready for upwards of a year.

1098
01:43:49,053 --> 01:43:56,997
[SPEAKER_20]: to be able to be installed to support what would be needed for the full electrification of this project at the Brooklyn.

1099
01:43:57,137 --> 01:43:58,118
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, at the Brooks.

1100
01:43:58,758 --> 01:44:08,123
[SPEAKER_20]: So my recommendation is and as I said, more narrowly tailored is for the design and construction management piece.

1101
01:44:08,143 --> 01:44:17,588
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to have to figure out the funding allocation because that present $150,000 allocation in the school budget is entirely unrealistic.

1102
01:44:18,768 --> 01:44:25,450
[SPEAKER_20]: But this is a pressing capital need that unfortunately forced itself on us.

1103
01:44:27,351 --> 01:44:27,591
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor.

1104
01:44:28,711 --> 01:44:29,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rousseau.

1105
01:44:30,512 --> 01:44:30,872
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1106
01:44:31,112 --> 01:44:32,892
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate that you tried to get answers.

1107
01:44:32,992 --> 01:44:37,574
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't sound like B2Q actually wants to give an answer to the question I asked about.

1108
01:44:38,972 --> 01:44:42,135
[SPEAKER_22]: After 15 years, my question was pretty straightforward.

1109
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:50,183
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there any reason to believe that when this equipment must be replaced, that the electric replacement equipment in 10 to 15 years will be any cheaper than it is today?

1110
01:44:52,785 --> 01:44:56,549
[SPEAKER_22]: There's going to be a day when we're not going to be able to replace this stuff with...

1111
01:44:58,012 --> 01:45:01,233
[SPEAKER_22]: with fossil fuel based equipment.

1112
01:45:02,073 --> 01:45:12,915
[SPEAKER_22]: And when I look at expenses like the electrical upgrade, the infrastructure upgrade that's gonna be required if we chose the electrical option, well, that number will get bigger and bigger every year.

1113
01:45:12,935 --> 01:45:17,176
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's a lot of labor and big equipment.

1114
01:45:17,456 --> 01:45:19,817
[SPEAKER_22]: So every year that number will continue to go up.

1115
01:45:19,977 --> 01:45:23,618
[SPEAKER_22]: So in 15 years, I don't know, double, triple, whatever it will be today.

1116
01:45:24,518 --> 01:45:43,409
[SPEAKER_22]: um on top of inflation so um i mean my estimate you know is that we are looking at just being fine with an additional 185 000 pounds of carbon emissions by choosing the gas option over the electric option

1117
01:45:46,124 --> 01:45:52,648
[SPEAKER_22]: I really wanted them to do an analysis, like just pretend electric rates don't change between now and 15 years from now.

1118
01:45:53,188 --> 01:45:55,709
[SPEAKER_22]: Pretend the gas rates don't change.

1119
01:45:55,729 --> 01:45:57,931
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we can't know those two things.

1120
01:45:58,571 --> 01:46:02,573
[SPEAKER_22]: But what would it cost to operate these two pieces of equipment over 15 years?

1121
01:46:03,494 --> 01:46:05,055
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know why that was too hard for them.

1122
01:46:05,535 --> 01:46:08,196
[SPEAKER_22]: Based on the response, it sounds like they didn't want to be bothered.

1123
01:46:08,917 --> 01:46:13,259
[SPEAKER_22]: Because this sentence here, frankly, is really obnoxious.

1124
01:46:13,559 --> 01:46:13,959
[SPEAKER_22]: It says...

1125
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:39,346
[SPEAKER_22]: uh sorry where's that sentence essentially they're saying all that we should care about is cost that that's what they're saying they're assuming that the only thing this committee this community and humanity should care about is how much it costs and if that's the case we should all get some coal going because coal is probably cheaper than everything else um so i i don't

1126
01:46:40,709 --> 01:46:43,111
[SPEAKER_22]: find their answer particularly satisfying.

1127
01:46:43,151 --> 01:46:53,718
[SPEAKER_22]: And I hope that in the future we can decide that we're not going to accept their answer until they actually give us an answer that answers our questions.

1128
01:46:53,878 --> 01:47:06,687
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not inappropriate for this committee to want to know this information as we are about to take a vote to pollute an additional 185,000 pounds of carbon into this atmosphere for one boiler at one school.

1129
01:47:08,788 --> 01:47:09,549
[SPEAKER_22]: I just think it's,

1130
01:47:11,277 --> 01:47:16,059
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's absurd that they don't see this as anything other than a cost analysis.

1131
01:47:20,321 --> 01:47:23,763
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know how else to be more ticked off about it than that.

1132
01:47:25,044 --> 01:47:26,725
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll let my colleagues ask their questions.

1133
01:47:30,046 --> 01:47:37,410
[SPEAKER_20]: If I may, I will say that this has nothing to do with our OPM or our designer.

1134
01:47:38,174 --> 01:47:41,007
[SPEAKER_20]: It has been extraordinarily sobering overall.

1135
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:56,563
[SPEAKER_20]: the lack of viable options for moving more quickly to full electrification or to really move off of fossil fuels through these projects.

1136
01:47:57,204 --> 01:47:59,824
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the best word I can use is sobering.

1137
01:48:01,185 --> 01:48:05,026
[SPEAKER_20]: I had high ambitious goals for us to be able to do those types of things.

1138
01:48:05,286 --> 01:48:12,048
[SPEAKER_20]: And just unfortunately, it's either exorbitantly costed to do it or

1139
01:48:13,004 --> 01:48:17,770
[SPEAKER_20]: the equipment does not exist in ways that we might think it would.

1140
01:48:20,232 --> 01:48:24,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it sounds like cost and time because of the equipment.

1141
01:48:24,077 --> 01:48:27,080
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Member Reinfeld, then Member Ruseau again.

1142
01:48:27,321 --> 01:48:32,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I would like to motion that the capital planning subcommittee in an upcoming meeting

1143
01:48:33,996 --> 01:48:44,698
[SPEAKER_10]: dedicate an agenda item to identifying a scope and timeline for coordinated electrification across the district, because we can't keep doing this on a one-off as things fail.

1144
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:46,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this one's too expensive.

1145
01:48:46,898 --> 01:48:48,799
[SPEAKER_10]: And they all end up being too expensive.

1146
01:48:48,819 --> 01:48:51,199
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to do this look big picture.

1147
01:48:51,219 --> 01:48:55,760
[SPEAKER_10]: This was the last one to fail, but what's next?

1148
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:57,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1149
01:48:58,140 --> 01:48:59,001
[SPEAKER_22]: What was the subcommittee?

1150
01:48:59,621 --> 01:49:00,981
[SPEAKER_10]: The capital planning subcommittee.

1151
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:01,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1152
01:49:07,844 --> 01:49:08,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you need more language?

1153
01:49:09,524 --> 01:49:10,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I got enough.

1154
01:49:10,365 --> 01:49:10,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

1155
01:49:14,865 --> 01:49:17,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Motions on the floor by Member Reinfeld, seconded by- Me.

1156
01:49:18,806 --> 01:49:27,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham to have a capital meeting with the subcommittee to discuss a plan.

1157
01:49:28,768 --> 01:49:29,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval.

1158
01:49:30,109 --> 01:49:30,829
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1159
01:49:31,189 --> 01:49:31,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1160
01:49:31,549 --> 01:49:31,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1161
01:49:31,829 --> 01:49:32,549
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1162
01:49:33,129 --> 01:49:33,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1163
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:34,750
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor.

1164
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:35,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau?

1165
01:49:37,023 --> 01:49:43,086
[SPEAKER_22]: This just dawned on me when somebody mentioned, I think you mentioned kitchen and electrification.

1166
01:49:43,666 --> 01:49:44,086
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, sorry.

1167
01:49:44,106 --> 01:49:45,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1168
01:49:45,307 --> 01:49:51,529
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we did buy stuff that we have to send back because our electrical infrastructure can't handle it.

1169
01:49:52,050 --> 01:50:01,694
[SPEAKER_22]: So you know, we when we decide we want to replace the Brooks's kitchen equipment with induction everything.

1170
01:50:02,813 --> 01:50:06,694
[SPEAKER_22]: we will be paying this expense then because we won't be able to do it then.

1171
01:50:07,174 --> 01:50:19,777
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's kind of like every project that is around electrification, we will either decide that we're just gonna, well, I guess we can't do it, it's too expensive, but it's like the same big expense in the middle of all of those decisions.

1172
01:50:21,838 --> 01:50:29,500
[SPEAKER_22]: And which year we decide, which budget do we decide, when does the city ever really have enough money to do that stuff?

1173
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:29,860
[SPEAKER_22]: That's...

1174
01:50:30,728 --> 01:50:41,138
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are big questions, but we're never going to get to our goals around carbon emissions if we just, every time we have the decision, we're like, well, we can't afford it right now.

1175
01:50:42,099 --> 01:50:43,040
[SPEAKER_22]: We're never going to afford it.

1176
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:54,372
[SPEAKER_20]: The other thing too, we just replaced, and I brought this before the committee, prior to doing it, we just replaced a number of ovens across the district.

1177
01:50:54,873 --> 01:50:58,373
[SPEAKER_20]: And our hope was that those were going to be electric ovens.

1178
01:50:59,014 --> 01:51:05,115
[SPEAKER_20]: And unfortunately, even in our quote unquote new schools, which I know we should not use that terminology,

1179
01:51:06,621 --> 01:51:15,139
[SPEAKER_20]: um the electrical circuitry was either not identified or misidentified which would have related to even further

1180
01:51:16,255 --> 01:51:22,217
[SPEAKER_20]: and higher costs dating back to original construction and development.

1181
01:51:22,497 --> 01:51:24,978
[SPEAKER_20]: And trust me, those buildings were built very well.

1182
01:51:26,658 --> 01:51:44,084
[SPEAKER_20]: But just to be able to identify the circuitry, I don't know the exact voltage or amperage, but if something trips with this new equipment, you're supposed to call in an electrician rather than have Director Smith go and flip the breaker herself because there's a possible of electrocution.

1183
01:51:44,885 --> 01:51:47,923
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's it just.

1184
01:51:49,102 --> 01:52:14,891
[SPEAKER_20]: unfortunately at every turn because when when director smith and i director smith of food services and i started on this path of really updating the kitchen equipment for the first time in all the years that the kitchens have been open at the five schools our goal was to replace them with all electric but the time cost really isn't even a factor when it comes to

1185
01:52:16,131 --> 01:52:37,844
[SPEAKER_20]: um food services because we have a surplus there are four specific food services expenses unfortunately the challenge is the time to get the equipment in in order to serve and prepare for our kids now so in the report later on i talk about what we will be doing to slowly move forward but again it's something that

1186
01:52:38,632 --> 01:52:41,173
[SPEAKER_20]: we all wanted to be a snap of the fingers.

1187
01:52:41,713 --> 01:52:44,315
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, this equipment is at the end of its life.

1188
01:52:45,115 --> 01:52:46,256
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's move to full electric.

1189
01:52:47,336 --> 01:52:55,960
[SPEAKER_20]: The challenges with that proved to be, I would use the term exponential as compared to what we expected.

1190
01:53:01,923 --> 01:53:02,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1191
01:53:04,224 --> 01:53:06,085
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor, we do need to approve the...

1192
01:53:08,308 --> 01:53:15,754
[SPEAKER_22]: capital planning, that the capital purchase, I'll make the motion to approve it because they need a boiler.

1193
01:53:15,774 --> 01:53:32,767
[SPEAKER_13]: And then before I call for a second, if we could just make sure that the purchase and either a short description and the price tag is on the agenda, just so we aren't referring back and forth, because I'm going with an electronic copy.

1194
01:53:33,708 --> 01:53:36,171
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be very helpful for the future.

1195
01:53:36,272 --> 01:53:39,316
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion for approval by Member Ruseau, seconded by- Second.

1196
01:53:39,837 --> 01:53:41,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Olapade, all those in favor?

1197
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1198
01:53:42,522 --> 01:53:44,084
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed, motion passes.

1199
01:53:45,126 --> 01:53:45,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1200
01:53:49,703 --> 01:54:02,912
[SPEAKER_20]: So the second request for approval by this committee, based on previous work I've done in other school districts, student parking does have a fee with it.

1201
01:54:03,073 --> 01:54:08,797
[SPEAKER_20]: The high school leadership team has asked me to come forward this evening to request a $150 annual fee that would fund

1202
01:54:14,706 --> 01:54:20,809
[SPEAKER_20]: activities for those students across the school.

1203
01:54:21,729 --> 01:54:34,875
[SPEAKER_20]: And if the senior class members want to paint their space, 50% of the fee would go to the senior class fundraising efforts for various activities throughout the year for seniors.

1204
01:54:37,290 --> 01:54:50,910
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm requesting as part of the rate card, this seems the best place for this type of thing to live because then it would fall under annual review of the school committee, but would be designated to go to a student activities account.

1205
01:54:51,704 --> 01:55:13,435
[SPEAKER_20]: uh senior class activities account is already set up we would need to set up the other student activities account to make sure that it falls within the stated purpose for student-centered community activities as requested by the high school leadership if i can from the chair i mean i think we all should speak on it but it's not on the agenda

1206
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:19,252
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't feel comfortable moving forward with it until we're transparently putting it on an agenda.

1207
01:55:19,752 --> 01:55:21,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Because report on operations, I don't think covers it.

1208
01:55:22,553 --> 01:55:24,393
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just my opinion from the chair.

1209
01:55:24,713 --> 01:55:27,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rousseau, and then, oh, I'm sorry, I don't.

1210
01:55:28,314 --> 01:55:28,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Reinfeld.

1211
01:55:29,215 --> 01:55:33,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just curious why this wouldn't go towards other transportation related costs.

1212
01:55:34,856 --> 01:55:39,678
[SPEAKER_10]: If it is a parking fee for vehicles and a. Yeah.

1213
01:55:40,157 --> 01:56:00,892
[SPEAKER_20]: the the transfer there so it's student transportation as in their own vehicles whereas the fees that students pay for a bus pass for the mbta go to the mbta but we collect no other transportation fees so it's more of just i would say a parking fee as opposed to a transportation fee

1214
01:56:05,589 --> 01:56:06,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

1215
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:09,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I would agree with you that this should go on the agenda.

1216
01:56:09,791 --> 01:56:16,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm generally not in favor of charging kids to get to school, like no matter how they have to get there.

1217
01:56:18,636 --> 01:56:20,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we should charge for buses.

1218
01:56:20,277 --> 01:56:22,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should provide more buses than we do.

1219
01:56:22,978 --> 01:56:27,061
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've been paying attention on social media, there's a lot of conversation about buses.

1220
01:56:28,922 --> 01:56:33,364
[SPEAKER_07]: The program around free MBTA transportation was stopped without this

1221
01:56:33,854 --> 01:56:39,338
[SPEAKER_07]: committee's authorization to do so, we have to stop charging kids to get them to school.

1222
01:56:39,358 --> 01:56:42,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's our job to educate them and we can't do that if they're not in school.

1223
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:47,024
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like for me, for any which way that we're gonna charge.

1224
01:56:48,032 --> 01:56:50,014
[SPEAKER_07]: families to get them to school.

1225
01:56:50,094 --> 01:56:53,496
[SPEAKER_07]: It just feels like we're heading in the wrong direction.

1226
01:56:53,516 --> 01:56:56,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that we are charging some kids and not others.

1227
01:56:56,699 --> 01:57:04,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that is also a problem, but charging more kids for me doesn't get us closer to the goal of not charging kids to have to get to school.

1228
01:57:04,244 --> 01:57:14,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not super in favor of this, but I do think it should go on the agenda separately noticed so that parents can understand that that's what we are talking about.

1229
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:21,243
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion to table.

1230
01:57:21,263 --> 01:57:23,545
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even, it's not even on the agenda.

1231
01:57:23,565 --> 01:57:30,449
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's, I can withdraw it and maybe withdraw it and then just make sure it's very transparent on the, on the agenda for our next meeting.

1232
01:57:30,489 --> 01:57:32,750
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be very appreciated.

1233
01:57:33,591 --> 01:57:33,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1234
01:57:36,331 --> 01:57:38,572
[SPEAKER_20]: So McGlynn playground update.

1235
01:57:39,112 --> 01:57:43,574
[SPEAKER_20]: We had hoped to have the playground open for the end of August and the beginning of school.

1236
01:57:44,775 --> 01:57:52,698
[SPEAKER_20]: There was an unfortunate situation where the playground equipment itself was packaged for efficiency.

1237
01:57:53,578 --> 01:57:59,901
[SPEAKER_20]: And at the same exact time, so that meant multiple pieces of equipment's parts were mixed in together.

1238
01:58:00,521 --> 01:58:09,311
[SPEAKER_20]: And at the same time, the playground manufacturer changed their labeling system but failed to update in a timely enough fashion their instruction manuals.

1239
01:58:10,072 --> 01:58:17,099
[SPEAKER_20]: So a piece of equipment that may have taken between five and eight hours to sort, that piece of equipment took approximately 40 hours.

1240
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:19,041
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's just one piece of equipment.

1241
01:58:19,922 --> 01:58:42,322
[SPEAKER_20]: uh so it it led to an extreme delay the other thing that really caused a delay in visiting the playground during the summer prior to august 1st the intense heat to work out there cause and we have put in i believe it's 66 trees countless shrubs bushes that once those mature

1242
01:58:43,243 --> 01:58:50,329
[SPEAKER_20]: the heat element of the playground should not be as much of an issue, especially as we had in school and shoulder months away from summer.

1243
01:58:50,850 --> 01:58:53,753
[SPEAKER_20]: But working out there was a challenge.

1244
01:58:54,273 --> 01:58:58,317
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have tentatively, not tentatively, we have scheduled October 8th.

1245
01:58:59,358 --> 01:59:00,519
[SPEAKER_20]: at 3.30 p.m.

1246
01:59:01,059 --> 01:59:02,820
[SPEAKER_20]: as a ribbon cutting ceremony.

1247
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:09,983
[SPEAKER_20]: We anticipate being done with the full playground toward the last week of September.

1248
01:59:10,463 --> 01:59:17,387
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll use that time to go through punch list items and other things that need to be fixed, repaired, swapped out.

1249
01:59:18,527 --> 01:59:21,428
[SPEAKER_20]: We were sent the wrong color scheme for the we go around.

1250
01:59:21,729 --> 01:59:24,490
[SPEAKER_20]: The manufacturer is accepted full responsibility for that.

1251
01:59:25,751 --> 01:59:30,294
[SPEAKER_20]: All the colors were designed for accessibility for students with vision impairments.

1252
01:59:31,334 --> 01:59:41,261
[SPEAKER_20]: Our carpentry shop and metal fab is in the process of having the buddy bench so that it can be reinstalled at the playground.

1253
01:59:45,043 --> 01:59:48,584
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to go into detail if anyone has any questions about the McGlynn playground.

1254
01:59:49,105 --> 02:00:03,110
[SPEAKER_20]: But in addition to playgrounds, we also received upwards of $20,000 from the Community Preservation Fund in Medford for three bike repair stations, one at Medford High School,

1255
02:00:03,690 --> 02:00:15,881
[SPEAKER_20]: one at the Andrews, one at the McGlynn, and for a significant upgrade to bike racks, not covered at this time, but bike rack upgrades at the McGlynn and Medford High School.

1256
02:00:16,081 --> 02:00:25,589
[SPEAKER_20]: We've already installed upgraded bike racks from a grant, thanks to Vivian Ortiz and other members of Smart Roots School for us to be able to really...

1257
02:00:27,290 --> 02:00:28,613
[SPEAKER_20]: install those at the Andrews.

1258
02:00:28,954 --> 02:00:30,518
[SPEAKER_20]: You can see those already installed.

1259
02:00:30,879 --> 02:00:34,988
[SPEAKER_20]: Our goal is to have the repair stations installed in the next couple of weeks here.

1260
02:00:35,048 --> 02:00:36,712
[SPEAKER_20]: We're working through procurement on that.

1261
02:00:38,561 --> 02:00:39,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Reichelt?

1262
02:00:39,321 --> 02:00:45,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just curious whether we get any remuneration from these companies that delayed our process.

1263
02:00:45,783 --> 02:00:48,104
[SPEAKER_10]: You said they accepted full responsibility.

1264
02:00:49,024 --> 02:00:50,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that just an I'm sorry?

1265
02:00:50,344 --> 02:00:56,666
[SPEAKER_20]: So on this issue, we don't see remuneration coming.

1266
02:00:56,886 --> 02:01:00,507
[SPEAKER_20]: On other issues regarding the playground, the...

1267
02:01:02,688 --> 02:01:28,682
[SPEAKER_20]: the shed canopy structure pavilion uh over the stage for lack of a better term uh it was was um not properly drilled so they had to send a jig out and that that caused uh several days delay that did come with several thousand dollars of remuneration okay and what about the parts the the manual unfortunately nothing okay yeah that's a sorry for that

1268
02:01:29,755 --> 02:01:43,083
[SPEAKER_20]: But I will say that Quirk Construction and Copley-Wolf have done a good job on really being budget hawks on this and supporting us.

1269
02:01:44,163 --> 02:01:47,145
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it sounds like the project is going as smoothly as it can.

1270
02:01:47,185 --> 02:01:48,806
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to thank the McGlynn Elementary.

1271
02:01:48,846 --> 02:01:49,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

1272
02:01:50,347 --> 02:01:53,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank the McGlynn Elementary community for their patience on this.

1273
02:01:53,909 --> 02:01:54,510
[SPEAKER_20]: I do as well.

1274
02:01:54,770 --> 02:01:57,952
[SPEAKER_20]: And the principal, assistant principal, and all the students who are still on Hormel.

1275
02:01:58,552 --> 02:01:58,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1276
02:01:59,684 --> 02:01:59,964
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1277
02:02:02,165 --> 02:02:04,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on.

1278
02:02:05,286 --> 02:02:05,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on.

1279
02:02:05,866 --> 02:02:20,391
[SPEAKER_13]: And while you're looking for your next item, maybe a thought process before the next meeting on the parking spot issue is teens, high school students paying for a spot so they can decorate and have their own.

1280
02:02:21,091 --> 02:02:21,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Something like that.

1281
02:02:21,931 --> 02:02:23,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to think a little bit more creatively.

1282
02:02:24,992 --> 02:02:26,793
[SPEAKER_20]: I will work with our high school staff on that.

1283
02:02:26,873 --> 02:02:27,353
[SPEAKER_13]: On to the next.

1284
02:02:28,855 --> 02:02:29,465
[SPEAKER_20]: Transportation.

1285
02:02:30,842 --> 02:02:34,403
[SPEAKER_20]: I put this on so that we can have an open and honest conversation.

1286
02:02:35,483 --> 02:02:45,766
[SPEAKER_20]: So despite budgeting for and requesting additional buses, our yellow bus provider has as to yet been unable to provide those additional buses.

1287
02:02:47,666 --> 02:02:58,889
[SPEAKER_20]: In particular, those buses would help alleviate overcrowding on our middle school runs, as well as our routes at the Brooks and the Roberts.

1288
02:03:00,242 --> 02:03:03,463
[SPEAKER_20]: evidenced by the enrollment update that was given by Dr. Gallucci.

1289
02:03:05,224 --> 02:03:20,489
[SPEAKER_20]: So these buses are really critical to alleviate the overcrowding and to also provide transportation to our students looking to get to some aftercare programs so that parents are not faced with that burden as they are in other districts.

1290
02:03:21,209 --> 02:03:27,153
[SPEAKER_20]: We are also working through with one of our new partners, SNL, Saturday Night Lights.

1291
02:03:27,193 --> 02:03:30,755
[SPEAKER_20]: You may remember them from helping to put on the fifth grade Olympics.

1292
02:03:31,656 --> 02:03:34,298
[SPEAKER_20]: They're working at the Brooks right now in particular.

1293
02:03:34,898 --> 02:03:49,548
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we have permission slip requests out to families for that interim time from dismissal to about today, pick up by the, that late bus was 337 in order to get them to, I believe it's Ready Set Kids and Sigma.

1294
02:03:51,510 --> 02:04:00,884
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're trying to work the work the problem and also make sure that we're examining our bus contract by our count.

1295
02:04:04,090 --> 02:04:33,830
[SPEAKER_20]: know it says approximately 18 buses by my count we have four buses to completely fulfill our contract based on an invoice received today for 14 buses so in my opinion we're going to continue to press our yellow bus provider to make sure that we are receiving the buses that our students need i know that there was we sent out a transportation memo to families

1296
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:40,333
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want families to think that there's a blanket under two miles or cut off or anything like that.

1297
02:04:40,493 --> 02:04:45,496
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just because of the overcrowding, we really have to take a look at each and every student.

1298
02:04:46,016 --> 02:04:52,019
[SPEAKER_20]: By no means, if your child is in a dangerous situation, are we going to throw them off of a bus?

1299
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:55,461
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't have enough crossing guards in the city.

1300
02:04:55,641 --> 02:05:03,745
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm working with the chief on that to post on Facebook and to recruit and to see if we have employees that could do special employee status and

1301
02:05:04,369 --> 02:05:08,471
[SPEAKER_20]: and work crossing guard lunch duty or whatever it may be.

1302
02:05:09,932 --> 02:05:33,325
[SPEAKER_20]: We're trying to solve and problem solve these complex issues to make sure that our families and students are first safe and then have the convenience slash requirements of life in 2024, 2025 to make sure that their children are supported between the time they get out of school and the time that they are able to get home from work to be with their children.

1303
02:05:34,486 --> 02:05:41,071
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a complex problem that unfortunately is being faced across the nation when it comes to bus shortages.

1304
02:05:42,252 --> 02:05:44,975
[SPEAKER_20]: Our yellow bus contractor has the equipment.

1305
02:05:46,295 --> 02:05:52,558
[SPEAKER_20]: they are allegedly training drivers, and we hope that that is going to yield benefit.

1306
02:05:52,778 --> 02:05:53,918
[SPEAKER_20]: It is budgeted for.

1307
02:05:54,599 --> 02:05:57,620
[SPEAKER_20]: We have the resources for those two additional buses.

1308
02:05:58,180 --> 02:06:07,484
[SPEAKER_20]: If something doesn't give in the coming days, we will put together an RFP to seek two buses from elsewhere if necessary.

1309
02:06:08,825 --> 02:06:13,387
[SPEAKER_20]: However, I know that this is a very discussed issue at this point.

1310
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:22,844
[SPEAKER_13]: through the chair did they say how long it's going to take to train that they're in bus drivers are in training do they say how long it's going to take for medford to get two more

1311
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:31,486
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did speak with Mr. Chuck Glitzer, who's the owner of Eastern Bus today.

1312
02:06:33,128 --> 02:06:36,471
[SPEAKER_02]: They are facing the same crisis that's happening everywhere.

1313
02:06:37,011 --> 02:06:43,437
[SPEAKER_02]: They trained 16 new bus drivers, and two weeks before school started...

1314
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:50,061
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 of those bus drivers moved on for different reasons.

1315
02:06:50,261 --> 02:06:55,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were down to four bus drivers and they are retraining again.

1316
02:06:55,963 --> 02:06:57,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So we spoke today in person.

1317
02:06:57,784 --> 02:07:04,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also with Megan who is over our family and community engagement.

1318
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:08,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So he is working diligently.

1319
02:07:08,150 --> 02:07:24,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I expressed the pressing issue that Medford is facing and he is prioritizing Medford and said he wants to be able to provide us with an update before the end of this month, but I am gonna continue to check in with him.

1320
02:07:24,903 --> 02:07:28,186
[SPEAKER_02]: But he clearly expressed that they thought they were ahead.

1321
02:07:29,226 --> 02:07:37,190
[SPEAKER_02]: They have their own training, but I think there's a lot of poaching going on and people moving from one company to another company.

1322
02:07:37,710 --> 02:07:43,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the information that he had today, but that they are working towards that.

1323
02:07:44,193 --> 02:07:52,157
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have 14 buses servicing the Medford Public Schools, the additional two buses that were requested.

1324
02:07:53,338 --> 02:07:59,282
[SPEAKER_02]: we are not being charged for those additional buses because they're not servicing the Medford public schools.

1325
02:08:00,023 --> 02:08:11,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And also because we are in collaboration or coordination with the Catholic schools, they have access to approximately three school buses.

1326
02:08:12,333 --> 02:08:17,417
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is inclusive of the total number of buses.

1327
02:08:18,238 --> 02:08:22,081
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we're not being charged for the buses that we don't have access to.

1328
02:08:23,049 --> 02:08:30,968
[SPEAKER_13]: And then just thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent, just to follow up the training that the current personnel are in now, is that a two week training?

1329
02:08:31,049 --> 02:08:32,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a four week training?

1330
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:34,491
[SPEAKER_02]: He did say it was several weeks.

1331
02:08:34,571 --> 02:08:38,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't ask for the specific number with the CDL license.

1332
02:08:38,734 --> 02:08:53,564
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have a small group going through right now, but he did say that the, you know, that large group of 16 that they were really counting on, you know, they didn't expect that they were going to lose 12 of them.

1333
02:08:54,164 --> 02:09:02,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very competitive field out there, and he is trying, so I'm going to continue to keep,

1334
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:09,975
[SPEAKER_02]: City Council Chambers, advocating for medford and seeing if he can get us some harder numbers, but at this point in time.

1335
02:09:09,995 --> 02:09:19,803
[SPEAKER_02]: City Council Chambers, They do not have the bodies and again the money was already allocated so they want to have the drivers, so they can be compensated for the additional buses.

1336
02:09:19,823 --> 02:09:30,511
[SPEAKER_02]: City Council Chambers, So we don't have the drivers to service our schools and families and they don't get the compensation, because the buses aren't working for us and.

1337
02:09:32,014 --> 02:09:47,617
[SPEAKER_13]: if somebody wants to make a motion, I think since we're not paying for the two buses that we budgeted for, as we hear of overcrowding issues, because like Dr. Cushing said, we're not gonna make kids walk home in a dangerous situation.

1338
02:09:48,877 --> 02:10:00,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we make sure that there's a monitor on those buses with that funding until these two additional ones come online so that we don't have any, so nobody gets hurt and there's no liability on the city and schools?

1339
02:10:02,327 --> 02:10:25,686
[SPEAKER_02]: so we could definitely we don't formally have monitors but that is something that i'm sure we could definitely um try to post and see if whether we could get paraprofessionals or other people who would be interested in being bus monitors for a morning run or afternoon run yeah thank you we are also running calculations um

1340
02:10:26,701 --> 02:10:33,268
[SPEAKER_20]: The bus capacity is for grades second and under is 77.

1341
02:10:34,489 --> 02:10:36,912
[SPEAKER_20]: For grades three and up is 51.

1342
02:10:39,031 --> 02:11:02,241
[SPEAKER_20]: right so as we prepare our bus rfp for uh bid later this year i'm sure there will be definitely more conversations on that from this body thinking about transportation across the district but as we prepare that we are looking at what it would take for every single student if needed to receive transportation

1343
02:11:03,021 --> 02:11:04,302
[SPEAKER_20]: and what those costs would be.

1344
02:11:05,823 --> 02:11:12,766
[SPEAKER_20]: The rough numbers are bus costs about $115,000 a year.

1345
02:11:13,726 --> 02:11:19,730
[SPEAKER_20]: Please, those are rough numbers, but $115,000 a year moving into next year.

1346
02:11:21,130 --> 02:11:21,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1347
02:11:22,571 --> 02:11:25,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau, and then we may have a parent that wants to speak.

1348
02:11:25,332 --> 02:11:25,572
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

1349
02:11:25,713 --> 02:11:26,033
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1350
02:11:29,133 --> 02:11:48,224
[SPEAKER_22]: know i'm just reading an article um from this last year about worcester and their um they they got no bids so they decided to purchase at least 13 buses and that's sort of the trial of bringing busing inside i think that the

1351
02:11:50,233 --> 02:11:55,056
[SPEAKER_22]: The elephant in the room here is that we want workers to work for $20 or $25 an hour.

1352
02:11:55,196 --> 02:12:05,781
[SPEAKER_22]: And for every parent that has ridden on a school bus for a field trip, you know that is utterly insane because you couldn't pay me enough money to ride on a school bus every day.

1353
02:12:05,801 --> 02:12:06,722
[SPEAKER_22]: No way.

1354
02:12:08,402 --> 02:12:24,347
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, if we want to solve the problem, and I don't think solving the problem is expecting Eastern Bus and all the other bus companies to find these magical people to work for, frankly, not very much money for terrible hours.

1355
02:12:24,367 --> 02:12:26,908
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, they're not 40 hour a week jobs.

1356
02:12:28,526 --> 02:12:41,274
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, a solution that I'm going to ask you, if you know of districts that have brought all transportation inside, do they really run into these problems or do they have to pay their workers living wages with a pension and healthcare?

1357
02:12:41,414 --> 02:12:44,416
[SPEAKER_22]: And I mean, I don't know whether the bus companies do all that stuff.

1358
02:12:45,017 --> 02:12:55,844
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I do know that they don't pay them enough, but do districts that have brought this stuff all in house and have a union and all that other stuff, do they have these problems?

1359
02:12:56,297 --> 02:13:01,719
[SPEAKER_20]: I know this past year Framingham made the decision facing similar problems.

1360
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:04,780
[SPEAKER_20]: Framingham brought theirs in.

1361
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:12,822
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't speak to, I can start calling and speaking to transportation directors, but I don't, in all honesty, don't.

1362
02:13:13,442 --> 02:13:14,002
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1363
02:13:14,103 --> 02:13:15,704
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's just, I don't know either.

1364
02:13:15,724 --> 02:13:18,305
[SPEAKER_20]: But I do know Framingham did bring it inside.

1365
02:13:18,345 --> 02:13:24,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, I would say that's a one to two year planning phase to be able to make sure that you can bring the equipment on board.

1366
02:13:24,209 --> 02:13:34,115
[SPEAKER_20]: If we want to talk about electrification, how does that tie in potentially to Medford High School plans and whatever types of solar arrays and whatever and housing buses there?

1367
02:13:34,656 --> 02:13:35,676
[SPEAKER_20]: These are the types of questions.

1368
02:13:36,057 --> 02:13:40,840
[SPEAKER_20]: Does our DPW or how are they being repaired have the equipment that can be repairing them?

1369
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:45,901
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are just like broad questions that I've already started to consider.

1370
02:13:46,442 --> 02:13:53,924
[SPEAKER_20]: It is though, I will say, bringing transportation in-house is a capacity question of the ability for us to do it well.

1371
02:13:54,644 --> 02:14:02,207
[SPEAKER_20]: And that would be, I'd say like a one to two, two to three year planning phase to be able to make sure that we do it well.

1372
02:14:02,827 --> 02:14:06,808
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's not something that becomes more of a fiasco than it already is.

1373
02:14:07,108 --> 02:14:10,389
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I certainly don't think we can do that for this upcoming contract.

1374
02:14:10,429 --> 02:14:12,569
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be impossible, I think.

1375
02:14:14,509 --> 02:14:16,670
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know that it's a solution.

1376
02:14:16,870 --> 02:14:24,291
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you know, the efforts that Eastern Bus and all the other bus companies are going through to find people to work in these jobs.

1377
02:14:24,711 --> 02:14:27,512
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I heard, I don't even know who I had the conversation with.

1378
02:14:27,872 --> 02:14:33,653
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think it was you, but like during the pandemic, all these workers went to work for Uber and

1379
02:14:35,643 --> 02:14:47,253
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not interested in coming back to a job paying less that is, you know, I won't say worse because, I mean, obviously lots of people who drive buses probably enjoy it.

1380
02:14:48,534 --> 02:14:57,542
[SPEAKER_22]: I would not be one of them, but they all went someplace where they got paid even more with a lot more flexibility and all the other stuff.

1381
02:14:57,642 --> 02:15:00,845
[SPEAKER_22]: So thinking we're going to get them back.

1382
02:15:01,673 --> 02:15:03,014
[SPEAKER_22]: if we keep paying them the same.

1383
02:15:03,094 --> 02:15:05,515
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is the same conversation we have with afterschool.

1384
02:15:05,575 --> 02:15:13,120
[SPEAKER_22]: We really wanna solve the afterschool, and it's 50, it's 60, it's $70 an hour, and you can raise your eyebrows, but do you wanna solve the problem or not?

1385
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:21,525
[SPEAKER_22]: Because we're not making new people, so we gotta get people to quit existing jobs to take these jobs.

1386
02:15:21,685 --> 02:15:24,787
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really basic, simple math, it's capitalism.

1387
02:15:26,067 --> 02:15:28,309
[SPEAKER_22]: So if we want to solve these kinds of problems,

1388
02:15:29,209 --> 02:15:31,810
[SPEAKER_22]: they can be solved, but they are not gonna be cheap.

1389
02:15:31,910 --> 02:15:45,112
[SPEAKER_22]: The taxpayers have to decide, do we wanna solve the problem or we just wanna complain about the problem because the two cannot, or just complain about how much it costs because you can't have both.

1390
02:15:45,552 --> 02:15:47,493
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you can, but you don't get a solution.

1391
02:15:49,753 --> 02:15:50,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Member Rousseau.

1392
02:15:50,853 --> 02:15:51,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor?

1393
02:15:52,274 --> 02:15:53,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham?

1394
02:15:55,634 --> 02:15:59,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I have huge reservations about any idea that we would have to bring buses in-house.

1395
02:16:01,829 --> 02:16:12,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I would need to see a bullet proof plan that we're going to do it well, because I think we try to do a lot of things here on the cheap and it never works out.

1396
02:16:12,692 --> 02:16:20,874
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would take a lot of convincing for me to agree that we have the organizational capacity.

1397
02:16:20,974 --> 02:16:25,455
[SPEAKER_07]: We lack basic systems and structures every single place that you look.

1398
02:16:26,192 --> 02:16:29,253
[SPEAKER_07]: to think about bringing on something that we know nothing about.

1399
02:16:29,273 --> 02:16:41,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I have huge reservations about, I think we could maybe get there at some point, but what I would like to see is for us to own the pieces of this process that we already own and don't do well every single year.

1400
02:16:42,119 --> 02:16:46,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to completely re-envision how we think about bus service.

1401
02:16:47,061 --> 02:16:54,244
[SPEAKER_07]: We should not be asking families if they are gonna ride the bus, unless we know that they're eligible to ride the bus and that we have space for them.

1402
02:16:54,984 --> 02:17:06,210
[SPEAKER_07]: We know where every kid lives and we should be using that information proactively before two weeks before the start of school to be mapping routes and doing all the things that we need to do.

1403
02:17:06,330 --> 02:17:12,634
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there's a huge amount of improvement to make all around, including with our vendor.

1404
02:17:13,414 --> 02:17:16,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we need to have them come to a future meeting, I'm happy to do that.

1405
02:17:17,455 --> 02:17:23,017
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very complicated problem, but we have to own the pieces of this problem that we have failed at as well.

1406
02:17:23,097 --> 02:17:32,220
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the communication piece of this and the planning and really just sitting back and saying, what should this process look like and when would these steps happen?

1407
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:37,103
[SPEAKER_07]: would probably result in a completely different process than we do today.

1408
02:17:38,164 --> 02:17:49,352
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that is something we can actionably do, whether we have two more buses or three more buses or zero more buses, like we can get the registration process right and we're not even there yet.

1409
02:17:49,492 --> 02:17:51,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do think that needs to happen.

1410
02:17:52,454 --> 02:17:55,576
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to not be in situations where we're sending

1411
02:17:56,286 --> 02:18:00,887
[SPEAKER_07]: emails to families after the start of school, telling them, hey, change your plans.

1412
02:18:01,827 --> 02:18:04,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, we don't actually have a bus for your kids after all.

1413
02:18:05,188 --> 02:18:09,429
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to do better by this process for the things that we can control.

1414
02:18:09,489 --> 02:18:10,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not everything.

1415
02:18:10,509 --> 02:18:16,470
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't control how many bus drivers quit training in the week before school.

1416
02:18:16,530 --> 02:18:19,411
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't control that, but we can control a whole lot of other things.

1417
02:18:20,732 --> 02:18:27,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think I would like to see some sort of analysis of like how this process should go in the future because I don't think we're there.

1418
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:39,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is extraordinarily complicated issue I get that and I appreciate that and I just want to say I know how hard people are working to try to fix.

1419
02:18:39,827 --> 02:18:45,613
[SPEAKER_07]: the like unexpected string of problems that are sort of unfolding as the school year unfolds.

1420
02:18:45,673 --> 02:18:48,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do really, really appreciate their work.

1421
02:18:48,195 --> 02:18:53,040
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a new coordinator of transportation in our administrative assistance unit.

1422
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:56,143
[SPEAKER_07]: She's learning a brand new job that never existed before.

1423
02:18:56,838 --> 02:18:58,719
[SPEAKER_07]: and having to do this all at prime time.

1424
02:18:59,279 --> 02:19:08,721
[SPEAKER_07]: The office is frankly probably too small to have a director that shares responsibilities with all kinds of things and this, and just one administrative assistant.

1425
02:19:08,742 --> 02:19:13,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's a lot of problems here that we need to own ourselves and try to fix and do better by.

1426
02:19:13,623 --> 02:19:18,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if we could tighten all of that up, would this problem have been better?

1427
02:19:19,024 --> 02:19:19,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

1428
02:19:20,885 --> 02:19:24,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe not entirely, but probably at least somewhat better.

1429
02:19:24,486 --> 02:19:28,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to do that next year because we just can't, we just, we do this every year, every year.

1430
02:19:29,490 --> 02:19:30,431
[SPEAKER_07]: It's chaos.

1431
02:19:30,772 --> 02:19:35,095
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seems like the chaos shifts every year, but it's still chaos.

1432
02:19:35,135 --> 02:19:38,498
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to maybe try not to do chaos next year.

1433
02:19:42,061 --> 02:19:43,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Bramley.

1434
02:19:45,344 --> 02:19:47,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to agree with Member Graham.

1435
02:19:48,146 --> 02:19:52,670
[SPEAKER_08]: The proactive word was used, and I feel like we are a district that is constantly reactive.

1436
02:19:53,274 --> 02:19:54,655
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's aggravating.

1437
02:19:55,475 --> 02:20:00,957
[SPEAKER_08]: It's aggravating to see that I feel like in so many different aspects, we react to things that happen instead of being proactive.

1438
02:20:01,477 --> 02:20:05,239
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would love to hop on board to anybody that wants to be proactive because I'll come to every meeting.

1439
02:20:05,799 --> 02:20:07,000
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's be proactive.

1440
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:08,320
[SPEAKER_08]: We know school's going to start.

1441
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:09,461
[SPEAKER_08]: We know it's going to be warm.

1442
02:20:09,861 --> 02:20:12,502
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that, you know, it's going to get cold.

1443
02:20:12,602 --> 02:20:15,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, we know these things are going to happen, yet we're always shocked.

1444
02:20:16,203 --> 02:20:18,264
[SPEAKER_08]: And it blows my mind.

1445
02:20:18,344 --> 02:20:19,565
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet I don't know why I'm surprised.

1446
02:20:20,565 --> 02:20:23,066
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think if we could be proactive, that would be great.

1447
02:20:23,564 --> 02:20:25,205
[SPEAKER_08]: we know kids are gonna take the bus.

1448
02:20:25,686 --> 02:20:31,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a parent that always filled out that, oh yeah, we live here and we're gonna take the bus to the Brooks.

1449
02:20:34,212 --> 02:20:39,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why we always end up in a predicament like this and it's for more than one subject.

1450
02:20:39,216 --> 02:20:45,601
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just like member Graham said, being proactive, we know school's gonna start next year, we know we need the buses.

1451
02:20:45,681 --> 02:20:48,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously there's some stuff that we can't control in many different aspects, but.

1452
02:20:49,724 --> 02:20:51,605
[SPEAKER_08]: this seems something that we can control.

1453
02:20:51,705 --> 02:20:54,787
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that you said that you had a meeting coming up.

1454
02:20:54,847 --> 02:21:02,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to join you because I think that this is imperative that, you know, two weeks into school that we're telling parents, well, now we can't take your kid.

1455
02:21:02,372 --> 02:21:07,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, and you said, well, we're not going to leave your child out, you know, if it's unsafe.

1456
02:21:08,496 --> 02:21:10,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's going to make that judgment?

1457
02:21:10,497 --> 02:21:10,677
[SPEAKER_08]: You?

1458
02:21:11,638 --> 02:21:14,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying that you can't, but is the parent going to make that judgment?

1459
02:21:14,359 --> 02:21:16,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't think my child can cross Mystic Ave.

1460
02:21:16,681 --> 02:21:18,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, it's only a mile, so they can.

1461
02:21:19,275 --> 02:21:44,753
[SPEAKER_08]: don't think that's fair who's who's to say whose child is more responsible to to cross high street or you know i know that my son has said to me before when he was at the at the middle school i'm going to ride my bike there what from west medford that makes no sense to me it's too far you know what i mean it's too it's it's rush hour traffic there's so many you know obviously the bus to me would be the safest route for you to get your kid to school and

1462
02:21:45,683 --> 02:21:46,743
[SPEAKER_08]: There is the convenience of it.

1463
02:21:46,783 --> 02:21:47,744
[SPEAKER_08]: People have to get to work.

1464
02:21:48,164 --> 02:21:52,485
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a district that the majority of parents are two working parents.

1465
02:21:53,365 --> 02:21:56,626
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, they have to get to school.

1466
02:21:57,026 --> 02:21:58,166
[SPEAKER_08]: And to think the kids are going to walk.

1467
02:21:58,206 --> 02:22:01,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know when I go for a walk, it takes me 15 to 20 minutes to walk a mile.

1468
02:22:02,807 --> 02:22:04,488
[SPEAKER_08]: So what time are kids getting up?

1469
02:22:04,648 --> 02:22:05,888
[SPEAKER_08]: What time are we sending them out the door?

1470
02:22:05,948 --> 02:22:06,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it dark?

1471
02:22:07,368 --> 02:22:10,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think this all has to factor into it.

1472
02:22:11,009 --> 02:22:14,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just think it's such a, you know,

1473
02:22:15,439 --> 02:22:36,438
[SPEAKER_08]: broad aspect of saying like you know we're going to make sure the kids are safe but who's who's going to be the final say and what's safe for each individual kid so i just think that we just have to throw that out there and like i said i'd be more than happy to hop on board with any transportation meetings coming up so if you can let me know i'd be more than happy to do that so thank you thank you um

1474
02:22:39,771 --> 02:22:42,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Just come on up and give your name and address for the record.

1475
02:22:43,213 --> 02:22:43,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1476
02:22:43,513 --> 02:22:46,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Christine Gullah, 116 Exchange Avenue.

1477
02:22:46,695 --> 02:22:48,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I just agree with these two women.

1478
02:22:49,897 --> 02:22:51,618
[SPEAKER_06]: My daughter just started at Andrews.

1479
02:22:51,998 --> 02:22:53,339
[SPEAKER_06]: They usually get the bus.

1480
02:22:55,220 --> 02:22:59,342
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in housing, so all the kids walk up to Hicks Ave.

1481
02:22:59,921 --> 02:23:28,359
[SPEAKER_06]: in main street now i got an email uh thursday september 5th that they're going to be cutting the buses for a two mile radius well they're they're like 1.9 so i don't understand what's going on like so my kid is in all the other kids and they were going to be in jeopardy crossing mr calf right they didn't even they didn't even think about this like we don't even have a crossing guard there

1482
02:23:29,088 --> 02:23:32,432
[SPEAKER_06]: or the crossing guard near Wegmans, like what is going on?

1483
02:23:33,073 --> 02:23:37,037
[SPEAKER_06]: What time does these kids have to start walking to school?

1484
02:23:37,157 --> 02:23:42,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven o'clock and then the winter time, it's complete dark out.

1485
02:23:42,483 --> 02:23:44,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been a Medford resident for 52 years.

1486
02:23:44,985 --> 02:23:47,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I love Medford to death, but...

1487
02:23:47,932 --> 02:23:50,353
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the city plowing's not the best.

1488
02:23:51,013 --> 02:23:55,594
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so what are they going to, how are they walking these sidewalks?

1489
02:23:56,715 --> 02:24:00,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I'd have more parents here for that, but, you know, it is what it is.

1490
02:24:01,096 --> 02:24:08,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, I think there's been a lot of activity on social media, so we're trying to calm people down because that messaging.

1491
02:24:08,918 --> 02:24:10,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't, you know.

1492
02:24:11,119 --> 02:24:13,400
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't know if the admin has an answer, but 1.9 miles, I...

1493
02:24:14,970 --> 02:24:22,557
[SPEAKER_13]: think we're going to be excluding anybody from the bus but i'm not going to speak for yeah that's what i got out

1494
02:24:23,977 --> 02:24:47,554
[SPEAKER_20]: uh so i think that the email was that mic on yeah okay i think the email was the the message was a blanket statement to let people know state laws regulations those types of things but that if a child is ever going to or families are going to be told that you know you live a half mile or whatever it may be all right that um we would look at each individual situation

1495
02:24:48,194 --> 02:24:51,817
[SPEAKER_20]: to say, all right, you're walking through Roosevelt Circle.

1496
02:24:51,917 --> 02:24:53,899
[SPEAKER_20]: You're crossing this major thoroughfare.

1497
02:24:54,360 --> 02:25:02,887
[SPEAKER_20]: For parents to also understand and for the members of the committee to understand, Medford with several state roads moving through it.

1498
02:25:02,907 --> 02:25:08,432
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not talking 983, but I'm talking the Fellsway and other state roads.

1499
02:25:09,195 --> 02:25:15,024
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are not under the jurisdiction of the Medford Police for crossing guards.

1500
02:25:15,665 --> 02:25:24,578
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are under, if I remember correctly, DCR's jurisdiction, which we are then at the mercy of the state to put crossing guards there.

1501
02:25:25,471 --> 02:25:26,912
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't mean to be flip or anything like that.

1502
02:25:28,033 --> 02:25:40,080
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a compounding, complicating factor of if you have students under X distance to school, where if we could have a crossing guard, we may face a barrier with our state parks.

1503
02:25:40,620 --> 02:25:41,781
[SPEAKER_20]: Just as one example.

1504
02:25:43,102 --> 02:25:44,062
[SPEAKER_13]: So we hear you.

1505
02:25:45,123 --> 02:25:50,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if that- I mean, none of the kids in the neighborhood went to the bus stop today.

1506
02:25:50,406 --> 02:25:51,327
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't think there was a bus.

1507
02:25:52,529 --> 02:25:56,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So either they walked or my daughter was actually sick.

1508
02:25:56,532 --> 02:25:58,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually take the kids to school anyway.

1509
02:25:59,654 --> 02:26:02,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Another parent had to put them in there.

1510
02:26:03,817 --> 02:26:04,658
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know what to do.

1511
02:26:04,718 --> 02:26:07,000
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't know if the bus is there.

1512
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:08,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it there for tomorrow?

1513
02:26:08,301 --> 02:26:08,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1514
02:26:09,161 --> 02:26:11,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I have my kid walk up and then she's going to walk back home?

1515
02:26:13,894 --> 02:26:17,536
[SPEAKER_13]: No bus stops have changed and nobody's there checking your address.

1516
02:26:17,576 --> 02:26:20,598
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think there probably needs to be some follow-up messaging.

1517
02:26:21,878 --> 02:26:23,199
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little confusing.

1518
02:26:24,020 --> 02:26:33,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if your kids have to, well, I'm just speaking on my kids, if they have to walk underneath that bridge, basically there's almost homeless people there.

1519
02:26:34,485 --> 02:26:37,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Or walking near McDonald's Park, there's coyotes there.

1520
02:26:38,502 --> 02:26:59,681
[SPEAKER_06]: i don't think they really had a thought they thought into this before they put out the email or uh i don't know that's just me i just feel like there should be more we'll definitely be able to go back and just look at the different stops look at the distances and see where we're at especially for the middle schools

1521
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:06,104
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe the first set of messaging should have been, you know, we're experiencing overcrowding.

1522
02:27:06,444 --> 02:27:17,332
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you're a capable of taking your child, especially if you live more than two, two miles away, please do so while we, uh, bus drivers are getting trained and we're trying to get two more buses online.

1523
02:27:17,452 --> 02:27:21,936
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully the admins all here, they heard, heard you loud and clear.

1524
02:27:22,156 --> 02:27:25,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and I do know that it's state because that's state roads.

1525
02:27:25,979 --> 02:27:26,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1526
02:27:26,259 --> 02:27:26,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1527
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:27,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Then,

1528
02:27:27,864 --> 02:27:31,649
[SPEAKER_06]: we should have contacted state first before we eliminate.

1529
02:27:31,669 --> 02:27:38,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can't get any crossing guards or cops.

1530
02:27:38,578 --> 02:27:39,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Cops even do it now, right?

1531
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:41,121
[SPEAKER_06]: State police.

1532
02:27:41,502 --> 02:27:43,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be state police, but I don't think that.

1533
02:27:56,394 --> 02:28:23,419
[SPEAKER_06]: just scary because you just want your kid to make I mean a mother came up to me today and said I didn't know anything about the bus and I said yeah there was an email whatever school McGlynn Andrews and she said I don't even know if my daughter made it to school I haven't seen her because she works like parents like relying on these buses because they work both work full time like it's just scary I don't know this is my first time up here so don't mind me like

1534
02:28:24,127 --> 02:28:25,368
[SPEAKER_06]: You did good, you did good.

1535
02:28:26,449 --> 02:28:30,032
[SPEAKER_13]: It was good to hear a real life experience.

1536
02:28:30,313 --> 02:28:40,021
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think from this, you put your child on the bus tomorrow and hopefully some more messaging will go out, especially to the area where you live.

1537
02:28:40,041 --> 02:28:42,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, all right, thank you.

1538
02:28:42,904 --> 02:28:43,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have another comment?

1539
02:28:44,125 --> 02:28:44,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Cushing, one more.

1540
02:28:48,232 --> 02:28:48,532
[SPEAKER_16]: You're good.

1541
02:28:48,632 --> 02:28:49,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Is my name and address?

1542
02:28:49,593 --> 02:28:49,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1543
02:28:49,913 --> 02:28:51,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrea Porcaro, 42 Gill Street.

1544
02:28:52,616 --> 02:28:54,898
[SPEAKER_16]: I just actually had a quick question about all this bus stuff.

1545
02:28:55,418 --> 02:28:56,219
[SPEAKER_16]: When did it change?

1546
02:28:56,239 --> 02:28:57,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it used to be only a mile.

1547
02:28:58,841 --> 02:29:03,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Before COVID, it was a mile, and then they changed it to two for COVID because of the elementary.

1548
02:29:03,725 --> 02:29:05,146
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a mile for elementary.

1549
02:29:05,426 --> 02:29:05,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1550
02:29:05,887 --> 02:29:06,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Two miles for middle.

1551
02:29:07,008 --> 02:29:07,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1552
02:29:07,448 --> 02:29:07,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Got it.

1553
02:29:07,868 --> 02:29:08,469
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what it is.

1554
02:29:09,049 --> 02:29:09,370
Okay.

1555
02:29:10,350 --> 02:29:11,711
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, that's what changed.

1556
02:29:11,771 --> 02:29:12,372
[SPEAKER_16]: My kids got older.

1557
02:29:12,392 --> 02:29:12,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Kids got older.

1558
02:29:13,133 --> 02:29:13,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

1559
02:29:13,593 --> 02:29:13,973
[SPEAKER_16]: You did it.

1560
02:29:14,033 --> 02:29:15,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't worry.

1561
02:29:15,314 --> 02:29:15,755
[SPEAKER_16]: You did it.

1562
02:29:17,734 --> 02:29:18,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

1563
02:29:18,335 --> 02:29:19,256
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to move on.

1564
02:29:19,516 --> 02:29:21,398
[SPEAKER_13]: We have no presentations of the public.

1565
02:29:23,019 --> 02:29:26,943
[SPEAKER_13]: We have no continued business, and we have one new... Oh, we're not done?

1566
02:29:30,246 --> 02:29:30,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1567
02:29:34,891 --> 02:29:36,032
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Eileen Lerner.

1568
02:29:38,754 --> 02:29:40,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, Eileen.

1569
02:29:50,919 --> 02:29:54,780
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Eileen Lerner, 9 Adams Circle, Medford, Mass.

1570
02:29:55,920 --> 02:30:14,065
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, watching this meeting is more painful than a lot of the meetings that I've watched before that have been very painful also because to see all of you guys who work so hard to serve the city and the schools,

1571
02:30:15,376 --> 02:30:44,418
[SPEAKER_17]: know scrambling to solve problems that you can't solve without money and from the everything you've talked about today revolves around money and we're just not we just don't have enough money even if we get the override we still need more money and i just think one of the things that i'd like to see the city doing is pressuring the state to pressure the federal government to give

1572
02:30:45,953 --> 02:30:48,414
[SPEAKER_17]: the states and the city more money.

1573
02:30:49,755 --> 02:30:50,776
[SPEAKER_17]: We need more money.

1574
02:30:50,976 --> 02:30:54,518
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's not magically going to appear.

1575
02:30:54,678 --> 02:30:56,159
[SPEAKER_17]: We need it for everything.

1576
02:30:57,359 --> 02:31:07,845
[SPEAKER_17]: And for us to be looking that somehow we're going to be able to solve these problems, I think is unrealistic.

1577
02:31:07,925 --> 02:31:09,947
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't solve them without more money.

1578
02:31:10,787 --> 02:31:13,429
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to thank all of you, because I know

1579
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:21,562
[SPEAKER_17]: from watching this, how excellent all of you are and how dedicated you are to the students.

1580
02:31:22,562 --> 02:31:33,705
[SPEAKER_17]: And I feel so frustrated that you're not able to do what you can do if you were set free with the amount of money you need to do it.

1581
02:31:35,026 --> 02:31:37,306
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's it.

1582
02:31:39,067 --> 02:31:39,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a good night.

1583
02:31:49,670 --> 02:31:50,133
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll be quick.

1584
02:31:53,624 --> 02:31:57,667
[SPEAKER_20]: Freedom Way lighting was completely replaced over the summer.

1585
02:31:58,468 --> 02:32:04,953
[SPEAKER_20]: HVAC chilling towers serving the classrooms at the Roberts failed towards the end of last year.

1586
02:32:05,774 --> 02:32:07,115
[SPEAKER_20]: We were able to get Trane in.

1587
02:32:07,355 --> 02:32:14,641
[SPEAKER_20]: We did an emergency procurement through the city approved by the Commonwealth to have Trane come in to repair that.

1588
02:32:15,382 --> 02:32:16,723
[SPEAKER_20]: That chiller has two circuits.

1589
02:32:16,963 --> 02:32:18,284
[SPEAKER_20]: One circuit is functioning.

1590
02:32:19,205 --> 02:32:21,327
[SPEAKER_20]: Speaking to the representative from Trane today,

1591
02:32:22,088 --> 02:32:41,205
[SPEAKER_20]: uh that circuit will be able to uh handle the shoulder months he said as we head into june july august next year the second circuit will have to be repaired we have a quote of approximately 23 000 for that at this point uh received today um so we'll be able to really look at that um

1592
02:32:42,130 --> 02:32:45,292
[SPEAKER_20]: McGlynn water infiltration.

1593
02:32:45,392 --> 02:32:49,754
[SPEAKER_20]: So along the rear of the building, we've had a persistent issue for several years now.

1594
02:32:50,335 --> 02:32:51,575
[SPEAKER_20]: We are seeking quotes.

1595
02:32:52,196 --> 02:32:57,059
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got two in right now for repairs and construction management.

1596
02:32:57,219 --> 02:33:02,522
[SPEAKER_20]: So design construction management, they vary between 65,000 and $95,000.

1597
02:33:03,242 --> 02:33:07,945
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, another unbudgeted expense that we need to be aware of for repair of this.

1598
02:33:08,405 --> 02:33:26,580
[SPEAKER_20]: this originally came before the committee in november of 2021 um so since march i've been really trying to accelerate it but there are some procurement challenges with scope and over ten thousand dollars we need a scope for the scope of work so it's a chicken and an egg challenge

1599
02:33:28,113 --> 02:33:29,194
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford High School bathrooms.

1600
02:33:29,674 --> 02:33:33,076
[SPEAKER_20]: So 12 bathrooms received a facelift this year.

1601
02:33:34,177 --> 02:33:36,378
[SPEAKER_20]: We had a tile painting company come in.

1602
02:33:37,438 --> 02:33:41,320
[SPEAKER_20]: We removed the countertops and sinks, painted 12 of the bathrooms.

1603
02:33:42,141 --> 02:33:51,186
[SPEAKER_20]: We deep scrubbed and did as much as we could to get the uric acid out of the grout in various places and painted the bathrooms, new countertops.

1604
02:33:51,346 --> 02:33:56,529
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly not a fun topic to talk about, but they really do look good.

1605
02:33:57,050 --> 02:34:04,769
[SPEAKER_20]: We are really happy to provide that for our students and we hope that they provide the due care and respect throughout.

1606
02:34:05,749 --> 02:34:11,014
[SPEAKER_20]: Food services in our kitchen, we've replaced and upgraded significant amounts of equipment in the past 12 months.

1607
02:34:11,555 --> 02:34:23,265
[SPEAKER_20]: We purchased all new point of sale equipment, five new gas ovens, one new electric oven that's at the Andrews, two new ice machines, eight new milk coolers, a new steamer, two new tilt skillets.

1608
02:34:23,786 --> 02:34:27,129
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're currently working with procurement to purchase six new standup refrigerators.

1609
02:34:27,649 --> 02:34:34,234
[SPEAKER_20]: We're also working to install remote monitoring devices on our freezers and walk-in coolers in order to respond if we have a power failure.

1610
02:34:34,654 --> 02:34:38,737
[SPEAKER_20]: We did suffer a power failure this summer and we lost $20,000 worth of provisions.

1611
02:34:39,998 --> 02:34:43,540
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're installing these devices to make sure that that never happens again.

1612
02:34:44,521 --> 02:34:48,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Cushing, before you continue, are there any questions about what Dr. Cushing has gone through?

1613
02:34:48,984 --> 02:34:51,005
[SPEAKER_07]: He just did like three updates real quick.

1614
02:34:51,045 --> 02:34:51,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry.

1615
02:34:51,866 --> 02:34:52,226
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

1616
02:34:53,872 --> 02:35:04,460
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to, you know, the bathroom work is great, but we have all been to many bathrooms outside of schools and somehow the uric acid is not what you smell.

1617
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:14,468
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would like to hope that there's regular maintenance that can keep it from being where the grout has absorbed all the way to the board, the blue board in the back.

1618
02:35:16,957 --> 02:35:21,839
[SPEAKER_22]: because that's not actually what happens in most bathrooms in most places you go to.

1619
02:35:22,279 --> 02:35:34,505
[SPEAKER_22]: And I've been to bathrooms in other schools like at Shore and they don't have to tap people in to do that kind of work because it's cleaned.

1620
02:35:35,831 --> 02:35:36,231
[SPEAKER_22]: daily.

1621
02:35:37,251 --> 02:35:38,052
[SPEAKER_20]: That is our goal.

1622
02:35:38,532 --> 02:35:38,712
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1623
02:35:38,912 --> 02:35:47,695
[SPEAKER_20]: Our goal is to provide daily cleaning, close the bathrooms during the day, refresh them, and then provide deep cleaning as required.

1624
02:35:48,175 --> 02:35:56,237
[SPEAKER_20]: We will be having a training on a half day for our custodial staff, more than likely in October, on proper bathroom cleaning techniques.

1625
02:35:56,497 --> 02:35:56,977
[SPEAKER_22]: Wonderful.

1626
02:35:57,097 --> 02:35:57,438
Thank you.

1627
02:35:57,978 --> 02:36:01,559
[SPEAKER_20]: Provided by our janitorial supplies company, Casey.

1628
02:36:02,866 --> 02:36:14,290
[SPEAKER_20]: I do want to say that we are also doing electric upgrades for tilt skillets, steamers, and an oven at each of the elementary schools and the McGlynn complex.

1629
02:36:14,330 --> 02:36:18,991
[SPEAKER_20]: That work was already done at the Andrews, but we're going to move deliberately.

1630
02:36:19,412 --> 02:36:26,234
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, not as quickly as we had all hoped to just do it all, but we will start replacing that equipment as we can.

1631
02:36:27,334 --> 02:36:32,017
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, there's further, uh, we're really excited about the menu items in food services.

1632
02:36:32,217 --> 02:36:33,578
[SPEAKER_20]: The national conference was here.

1633
02:36:34,179 --> 02:36:42,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, we're bringing on, uh, veggie burgers on a more regular basis, bento box, Brazilian marmita, uh, a ramen noodles that.

1634
02:36:43,024 --> 02:36:45,505
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to say, sampled it is absolutely phenomenal.

1635
02:36:46,586 --> 02:36:47,566
[SPEAKER_20]: It's restaurant quality.

1636
02:36:48,827 --> 02:36:56,891
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're very excited to welcome on board with Retta Smith, who has done nothing short of miraculous work in her year being here.

1637
02:36:57,372 --> 02:37:03,115
[SPEAKER_20]: And as we thanked other people earlier tonight, I really need to thank Retta for the work that she's done.

1638
02:37:04,135 --> 02:37:10,459
[SPEAKER_20]: We have also brought on board an assistant director, a position approved by this committee last year, Rita Toscano.

1639
02:37:11,259 --> 02:37:15,802
[SPEAKER_20]: She really brings a passion for feeding kids and feeding them really good food.

1640
02:37:16,783 --> 02:37:31,131
[SPEAKER_20]: We're bringing in produce, fresh produce, from places like Little Leaf Farms, and we're trying to make our culinary experience something that kids see as a positive, not as your typical school food options.

1641
02:37:34,002 --> 02:37:34,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Reindell?

1642
02:37:34,422 --> 02:37:35,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick question.

1643
02:37:35,263 --> 02:37:40,069
[SPEAKER_10]: The priority on local produce, I absolutely see it reflected in the lunches.

1644
02:37:40,490 --> 02:37:43,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we also expect to see it reflected in the breakfasts?

1645
02:37:43,936 --> 02:37:46,778
[SPEAKER_10]: which I think tend to be a little more carbon packaged.

1646
02:37:47,118 --> 02:37:49,960
[SPEAKER_20]: I can definitely talk to Director Smith about that.

1647
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:56,364
[SPEAKER_20]: I do know that we have in the past worked with Walden Local Meat.

1648
02:37:57,725 --> 02:38:02,788
[SPEAKER_20]: And so for, we will be bringing that on as well.

1649
02:38:02,828 --> 02:38:04,629
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'll see what we can do for our breakfast.

1650
02:38:07,291 --> 02:38:09,272
[SPEAKER_22]: I just, Bailey.

1651
02:38:11,269 --> 02:38:21,439
[SPEAKER_22]: Apparently, this was news to me because I don't follow this level of detail with food, but the USDA has regulations on the number of calories.

1652
02:38:21,799 --> 02:38:30,067
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have a friend who has a son at the high school who's like, you know, a man, an athlete.

1653
02:38:30,628 --> 02:38:30,728
[SPEAKER_22]: And

1654
02:38:31,158 --> 02:38:39,106
[SPEAKER_22]: the same number of calories have to be given to that person to somebody like me or somebody who doesn't need many calories.

1655
02:38:39,326 --> 02:38:49,275
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's really kind of bonkers that like 850 calories, it doesn't matter what on earth you as a human being need is the way it has to go.

1656
02:38:49,335 --> 02:38:49,976
[SPEAKER_22]: And I mean, I just...

1657
02:38:50,974 --> 02:39:03,784
[SPEAKER_22]: just found this out i found it rather unfortunate but that's those are the usda rules i guess and um i think it's crazy frankly i mean some of these you know i was not an athlete as you probably could have figured out but

1658
02:39:05,171 --> 02:39:12,374
[SPEAKER_22]: if I was like 850 calories is a snack for some of these kids and that's supposed to be their lunch.

1659
02:39:13,595 --> 02:39:15,416
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just think it's really unfortunate.

1660
02:39:15,476 --> 02:39:16,356
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to mention it.

1661
02:39:17,016 --> 02:39:29,062
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure two members of the committee who were recent graduates might be able to say that five chicken nuggets and some tater tots doesn't exactly make you a great crew athlete or whatever it may be.

1662
02:39:29,262 --> 02:39:32,544
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I mean, you know, we are offering the free meals under

1663
02:39:33,744 --> 02:39:58,557
[SPEAKER_20]: you know the state's awesome program for us to be able to do that um but to welcome students if yeah and we're doing everything we can to make sure and director smith does does see this as an issue it's just also what we're bound to and what qualifies as a reimbursable meal which i learned that for a six-month period of time working very closely with desi

1664
02:40:00,395 --> 02:40:02,478
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford High School, Missatuck, and Brooks.

1665
02:40:03,780 --> 02:40:08,426
[SPEAKER_20]: Missatuck and Brooks will have their lighting upgrades completed by December 31st.

1666
02:40:08,886 --> 02:40:13,252
[SPEAKER_20]: It's basically a no-brainer program through National Grid Mass Saves.

1667
02:40:14,433 --> 02:40:16,055
[SPEAKER_20]: 50% of all costs will be reimbursed.

1668
02:40:16,936 --> 02:40:21,078
[SPEAKER_20]: So the $300,000 project only costs about $149,000.

1669
02:40:22,018 --> 02:40:28,601
[SPEAKER_20]: It falls under procurement law chapter 25A as a green energy piece.

1670
02:40:28,801 --> 02:40:34,904
[SPEAKER_20]: So working with Alicia Hunt and Paul Riggy, we started to move forward on that.

1671
02:40:35,004 --> 02:40:44,167
[SPEAKER_20]: We do have phase two of lighting upgrades going throughout Medford High School, where we had very high carbon producing lights, T12s and worse.

1672
02:40:46,288 --> 02:40:48,609
[SPEAKER_20]: burning at our high school all day, all night.

1673
02:40:49,169 --> 02:40:57,411
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we're working to replace those, even though the building is sunsetting, we have an obligation to the students who are there to provide a better experience.

1674
02:40:57,671 --> 02:41:04,693
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's why we move forward with that phase two, but we will also be doing it at the Brooks and the Mississauga.

1675
02:41:04,853 --> 02:41:06,173
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the efficiency of this.

1676
02:41:06,273 --> 02:41:13,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure we're being aware of the effect that certain LED lights can have on headaches, migraines for the student health reasons.

1677
02:41:15,242 --> 02:41:16,545
[SPEAKER_20]: I have not seen that just yet.

1678
02:41:16,645 --> 02:41:17,708
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not saying it's not happening.

1679
02:41:17,808 --> 02:41:18,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1680
02:41:18,068 --> 02:41:21,155
[SPEAKER_10]: So just something to keep in mind proactively.

1681
02:41:21,175 --> 02:41:22,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1682
02:41:27,295 --> 02:41:34,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Caregiving University, we're working with the Medford Department of Health to create a Caregiving University to help support our family.

1683
02:41:34,581 --> 02:41:35,622
[SPEAKER_20]: Just wanted to make sure you know that.

1684
02:41:35,662 --> 02:41:37,944
[SPEAKER_20]: That's on the enrichment side of my title.

1685
02:41:38,905 --> 02:41:43,549
[SPEAKER_20]: Technology, we purchased 950 Chromebooks for student use, 120 MacBooks.

1686
02:41:44,009 --> 02:41:51,535
[SPEAKER_20]: We're also moving to higher security so that we'll have staff have USB devices to be able to plug in.

1687
02:41:52,256 --> 02:42:02,991
[SPEAKER_20]: to their computers to be able to log on with a multifactor authentication so that we'll be upgrading our security school committee members.

1688
02:42:03,111 --> 02:42:08,679
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll be included on any updates to that as necessary to log into your accounts.

1689
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:32,980
[SPEAKER_20]: um security at a baseline uh not just because but thanks to the mayor supporting us with arpa funds we've been able to replace all exterior locks uh and the district with the exception of the curtis tufts the key sign out form is at the very back of this packet we're being very very prescriptive and uh you know to many people's consternation

1690
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:34,701
[SPEAKER_20]: just not handing out keys.

1691
02:42:36,282 --> 02:42:41,605
[SPEAKER_20]: We do have, I wanted to provide also for you the standard response protocol.

1692
02:42:41,705 --> 02:42:44,886
[SPEAKER_20]: This year, we're continuing to use this.

1693
02:42:44,906 --> 02:42:48,649
[SPEAKER_20]: It was implemented in 2023, but we added two tabletop exercises.

1694
02:42:49,109 --> 02:42:54,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Those have been produced for our principals to use with their staff as well, a tabletop exercise.

1695
02:42:55,112 --> 02:42:59,574
[SPEAKER_20]: allows people to go through a drill without going through and living the trauma of a drill.

1696
02:43:00,375 --> 02:43:09,360
[SPEAKER_20]: You may have seen recently that the New York City schools have outright banned all drills because of the trauma that they can cause.

1697
02:43:09,800 --> 02:43:20,005
[SPEAKER_20]: I skipped over it in here, but starting tomorrow morning, you might see a crane in front of the McGlynn School as Gibson Roofing starts hoisting the six skylights.

1698
02:43:20,205 --> 02:43:23,247
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, thank you to Madam Mayor and her office for the ARPA funds.

1699
02:43:23,715 --> 02:43:26,236
[SPEAKER_20]: to support this project to replace the six skylights.

1700
02:43:26,997 --> 02:43:29,578
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had significant water infiltration in the library.

1701
02:43:29,698 --> 02:43:32,960
[SPEAKER_20]: We will work to repair the interior space once the work is completed.

1702
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:37,662
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're sure that everything is completely done.

1703
02:43:38,162 --> 02:43:48,067
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as positions in my area, we are actively hiring and interviewing this week and next for two custodial positions to work weekend shifts.

1704
02:43:48,848 --> 02:43:50,989
[SPEAKER_20]: And we'll also be looking for substitutes

1705
02:43:51,249 --> 02:44:08,959
[SPEAKER_20]: building monitors uh to fill for when those positions are absent if you have any questions happy to thank you for your time are there any more questions from the committee i'm going to call it a no we're going to move on thank you dr cushing

1706
02:44:10,756 --> 02:44:16,560
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have any presentations of the public or continued business, but we do have one item of new business.

1707
02:44:17,961 --> 02:44:20,523
[SPEAKER_07]: It is offered by Member Rousseau.

1708
02:44:20,583 --> 02:44:24,705
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the first reading of policy AC, non-discrimination, including harassment and retaliation.

1709
02:44:26,186 --> 02:44:31,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am going to read this in its entirety because I know there's some urgency to this policy.

1710
02:44:31,369 --> 02:44:41,073
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Medford School Committee and Medford Public Schools are committed to maintaining an education and work environment for all school community members free from all forms of discrimination, including harassment and retaliation.

1711
02:44:41,534 --> 02:44:50,958
[SPEAKER_07]: School community members include school committee, employees, administration, faculty, staff, students, volunteers in the schools, and parties contracted to perform work for the Medford Public Schools.

1712
02:44:51,715 --> 02:45:09,678
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford Public Schools does not exclude from participation, deny the benefits of the Medford Public Schools from or otherwise discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, religion, disability, age, genetic information.

1713
02:45:10,442 --> 02:45:28,667
[SPEAKER_07]: active military veteran status, marital status, familial status, pregnancy or pregnancy-related condition, housing status, ancestry, ethnic background, national origin, or any other category protected by state or federal law in the administration of its educational and employment policies or in its programs and activities.

1714
02:45:29,332 --> 02:45:32,253
[SPEAKER_07]: This commitment to the community is affirmed by the following statements.

1715
02:45:32,333 --> 02:45:44,617
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford School Committee commits to, one, promoting the rights and responsibilities of all individuals set forth in the state and federal constitution's pertinent legislation and applicable judicial interpretations.

1716
02:45:45,297 --> 02:45:56,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, encourage positive experiences and human values for children, youth, and adults, all of whom have differing personal and family characteristics and come from various socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups.

1717
02:45:57,270 --> 02:46:05,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Number three, work toward a more integrated society and enlisting the support of individuals as well as groups and agencies, both private and governmental in such an effort.

1718
02:46:06,675 --> 02:46:12,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Number four, using all appropriate communication and action techniques to air and address the grievances of individuals and groups.

1719
02:46:13,578 --> 02:46:22,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Number five, carefully consider in all the decisions made within the school district, the potential benefits or adverse consequences of those decisions on human relations.

1720
02:46:23,331 --> 02:46:31,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Number six, initiating the process of reviewing policies and practices of the school district to achieve to the greatest extent possible the objectives of the statement.

1721
02:46:33,339 --> 02:46:37,882
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford Public Schools requires all members of the school community to conduct themselves in accordance with this policy.

1722
02:46:38,122 --> 02:46:49,590
[SPEAKER_07]: It shall be a violation of this policy for any member of the school community to engage in any form of discrimination, including harassment, retaliation, or to violate any other civil right of any member of the school community.

1723
02:46:50,051 --> 02:46:54,634
[SPEAKER_07]: We recognize that discrimination can take a range of forms and can be targeted or unintentional.

1724
02:46:54,754 --> 02:46:59,237
[SPEAKER_07]: However, discrimination in any form, including harassment and retaliation, will not be tolerated.

1725
02:46:59,957 --> 02:47:15,125
[SPEAKER_07]: It shall also be a violation of this policy for any school community member to subject any other member of the school community to any form of retaliation, including but not limited to coercion, intimidation, interference, punishment, discrimination, or harassment.

1726
02:47:15,705 --> 02:47:31,293
[SPEAKER_07]: for reporting or filing a complaint of discrimination, cooperating in an investigation, aiding or encouraging another member of the school committee to report such conduct or file a complaint, or opposing any act or practice reasonably believed to be prohibited by this policy.

1727
02:47:32,013 --> 02:47:44,379
[SPEAKER_07]: There is an asterisk from an earlier list about race, race to include traits historically associated with race, including but not limited to hair texture, hair type, hair length, and protective hairstyles.

1728
02:47:45,595 --> 02:47:46,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

1729
02:47:47,337 --> 02:47:47,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1730
02:47:48,437 --> 02:47:57,205
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to warn everybody that the rest of the Title IX policies which we'll be receiving in the coming weeks make this look like a paragraph.

1731
02:47:57,765 --> 02:48:01,308
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of them are like dozens of pages long, unfortunately.

1732
02:48:02,590 --> 02:48:07,374
[SPEAKER_22]: So maybe we'll want to think about how we get through that in a meeting because we do have to at least read it once.

1733
02:48:07,714 --> 02:48:10,556
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyways, for this one, this is one of...

1734
02:48:11,657 --> 02:48:16,581
[SPEAKER_22]: many policies that we have to, this is when we're updating for Title IX.

1735
02:48:17,261 --> 02:48:19,703
[SPEAKER_22]: All of our other Title IX policies don't exist.

1736
02:48:20,483 --> 02:48:22,104
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's put the past in the past.

1737
02:48:23,085 --> 02:48:23,925
[SPEAKER_22]: They should have existed.

1738
02:48:24,046 --> 02:48:27,748
[SPEAKER_22]: But so I don't, I think the policy speaks for itself.

1739
02:48:28,569 --> 02:48:31,931
[SPEAKER_22]: And there is a number of cross-references.

1740
02:48:32,211 --> 02:48:38,535

1769
02:50:15,570 --> 02:50:15,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau?

1770
02:50:16,567 --> 02:50:46,008
[SPEAKER_22]: yes um we this is a relatively new thing for this committee the consent agenda i believe we just created that last year and i believe these are additional two types of approvals or things that we just approve so um i think it was the last meeting our meetings in june where we're like oh shouldn't this just be in consent agenda and i think everybody sort of thought it should so that's why i'm suggesting we amend this is there a motion on the floor

1771
02:50:47,004 --> 02:50:47,684
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a question.

1772
02:50:48,084 --> 02:50:48,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1773
02:50:48,525 --> 02:51:00,068
[SPEAKER_10]: So my only question is if this is something that we need to hear from the department that's requesting the field trip or we need to acknowledge the grant by some terms of the grant, we would then just sever it from the consent agenda to do that.

1774
02:51:00,809 --> 02:51:01,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1775
02:51:01,369 --> 02:51:02,149

1822
02:55:08,024 --> 02:55:12,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really, you know, I was really close with him and I really wanted to do something for him.

1823
02:55:12,932 --> 02:55:20,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know what to do, but I really want to do this thing that as a man of faith, he wanted to do a proxy baptism.

1824
02:55:21,537 --> 02:55:25,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had said, you know, but I really want to make sure I do this right.

1825
02:55:25,220 --> 02:55:32,185

1826
02:55:32,225 --> 02:55:35,547
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I don't I don't want to do this right.

1827
02:55:36,468 --> 02:55:43,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we talked with the family and we we got their approval and he went through with it.

1828
02:55:43,232 --> 02:55:44,113
[SPEAKER_05]: He was able to do it.

1829
02:55:45,594 --> 02:55:47,996
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, something that Wade really stood for, you know.

1830
02:55:49,474 --> 02:56:15,103
[SPEAKER_05]: making sure we care for and consider for and love one another even when no one is looking because he didn't have to do that but he did and he made sure that he was at peace and the family was at peace through no incidentals and i really just employ everyone listening that as we sort of navigate this grief to use the power of community and to check in on one another

1831
02:56:15,925 --> 02:56:25,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And I implore you all to text or reach out to in any way that you can, however you feel like you can, to someone you haven't talked to in a while.

1832
02:56:26,209 --> 02:56:31,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And to just really, really build that sense of community through what we have.

1833
