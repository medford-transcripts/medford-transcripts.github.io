173
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:21,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations.

174
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,016
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd like to thank the city council for having us here tonight.

175

[SPEAKER_30]: It's our sixth GBL title along with our sixth time going to the state tournament.

176
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,563
[SPEAKER_30]: The girls did a tremendous job this season.

177
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:39,685
[SPEAKER_30]: They work hard in and out of the season.

178
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,547
[SPEAKER_30]: Ladies, thank you for your hard work and determination.

179
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:44,309

180
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:45,910
[SPEAKER_30]: Happy New Year to everybody.

181
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,111

00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:54,398
[SPEAKER_25]: call the meeting back to order.

185

186
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:12,027

204
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,684
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just like to thank City Council for having us here today.

205
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:07,487
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time in Medford history that the girls volleyball team has won the GBL.

206
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:15,573
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm so proud of you girls.

207
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:20,496
[SPEAKER_00]: You work so hard all season and I'm just so impressed with you and I can't wait to get you all back next year.

208
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:21,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

209
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,622
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to take a brief recess to take a photograph with the team.

00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:39,144
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, all in favor?

220
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:39,964
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

221
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:41,585

00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,187

[SPEAKER_24]: Is the petitioner present?

234
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,786
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the petitioner is entering the chambers as we speak.

[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Viglione, your item is up for presentation.

236
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:55,756
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll give you a moment to compose yourself.

237
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:17,853
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

238
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:21,716
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your name and address for the record, please.

239
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:22,697
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

240
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:25,959
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

241
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:27,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, you went through that pretty quick.

242
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:29,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy New Year, City Council.

243
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations, Council President.

244
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:33,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure you're going to be a fine Council President.

245
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations, Ms.

246
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:36,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Lungelkern.

247
00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:40,629
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanted to talk about nonprofits.

248
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:46,213
[SPEAKER_10]: There are approximately 22,000 nonprofits in Massachusetts.

249
00:23:47,922 --> 00:23:49,403
[SPEAKER_10]: over a million nationwide.

250
00:23:51,824 --> 00:24:02,189
[SPEAKER_10]: And in Medford, we have had problems with sports and other entities not being properly monitored.

251
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:17,477
[SPEAKER_10]: The core issue here is that the nonprofits in question, three of them, had people in power for 30 years, 25 years, and I think it's incumbent upon elected officials

252
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,198
[SPEAKER_10]: to monitor these non-profits.

253
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Because someone has to.

254
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do you go to monitor a non-profit?

255
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:32,825
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go to the Attorney General's office, you can go to the District Attorney, you can go to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, but what gets done?

256
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:43,812
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we have a new TV station up at the high school, but we have questions about where all this money went from the previous one.

257
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,514
[SPEAKER_10]: West Medford Hillside Little League was able to

258
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:53,735
[SPEAKER_10]: through an insurance policy, recoup some of the funds, some of the funds, not all of them.

259
00:24:55,955 --> 00:25:14,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know what the elected officials in Medford, the school committee, the mayor, the city solicitor, the city council can do about looking closely at these entities, because if you look at Martha Coakley's site, I know she left office, but the site is still up today, it says that

260
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:19,575
[SPEAKER_10]: These nonprofits, these public charities, are supposed to help the public, Council President.

261
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:23,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And in Medford, are they?

262
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:25,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Where is our community?

263
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,781
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an issue with pay to park.

264
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:44,253
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that the nonprofits could work together to say, hey, when we're having an event at the Chevalier Theater, maybe it should be free parking on that evening without a solid government

265
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:51,394
[SPEAKER_10]: look at these nonprofits and how they operate, we're going to have the same old, same old problem.

266
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:56,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, City Solicitor Rumley did a great job in 2008 with something we call the Rumley Report.

267
00:25:56,856 --> 00:26:06,200
[SPEAKER_10]: It was written February 14, 2008, readily available on the web, but it was like going to a dead end.

268
00:26:07,663 --> 00:26:14,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Our city solicitor worked very hard to find all this information, and the mayor met with that nonprofit at two pizza parlors.

269
00:26:15,468 --> 00:26:16,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand, Council President.

270
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:22,692
[SPEAKER_10]: So in 2015, I want to know how we can govern these nonprofits better.

271
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:23,993
[SPEAKER_10]: They're independent.

272
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:25,714
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a board of directors.

273
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:26,774
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a president.

274
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:29,396
[SPEAKER_10]: But they just do things that are

275
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:40,455
[SPEAKER_10]: To the benefit of the board members, even if they're being honest with the money, they still make it a closed club, some of these entities.

276
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:46,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know what this council can do because we pay a lot of money to each councilor, a lot of money.

277
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:54,583
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know you all work hard and you go through the year looking at doing the best job you can.

278
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:59,026
[SPEAKER_10]: But with the kind of government we have, with this mayor having all the power,

279
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:05,082
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the city council needs to look at the money they're getting paid and say, hey, how can we control this a little bit better?

280
00:27:05,502 --> 00:27:05,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

281
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:08,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to receive and place on file.

282
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:12,268
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to receive and place in file.

283
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:13,048
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor.

284
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:14,249
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Penta.

285
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,071
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion.

286
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:20,795
[SPEAKER_14]: On that subject matter, I believe it's incumbent upon somebody in the city.

287
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:25,819
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's obvious that the administration maybe doesn't want to handle it.

288
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,740
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't want to talk about it.

289
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,561
[SPEAKER_14]: But the fact of the matter is,

290
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:30,753
[SPEAKER_14]: We have two particular cases that I wrote standing.

291
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:34,075
[SPEAKER_14]: One is the West Method Little League Hillside, and the other one is Channel 3.

292
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:45,642
[SPEAKER_14]: And Channel 3 has a large duty of obligation to the rate payers who have Comcast television, and now for those folks that have Verizon television.

293
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:53,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Because on a monthly basis, a fee has been taken out of your Comcast and Verizon bills for the purposes of giving you public access TV.

294
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:57,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Why the mayor decided to choose to put it up at the high school, a place that's not convenient,

295
00:27:58,482 --> 00:28:06,984
[SPEAKER_14]: and centrally located as was suggested by the that the mayor commissioned back in January, which submitted their report this past March.

296
00:28:07,044 --> 00:28:08,024
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, April, excuse me.

297
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:11,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I don't know why, but the fact of the matter is it's going up there.

298
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,665
[SPEAKER_14]: But during that period of time, there's a lot of new folks that are here.

299
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:21,687
[SPEAKER_14]: So you might as well hear it for the first time during that period of time, since December of 2000, um, 2013 till now, uh, the city of Medford has amassed over 356 million, $356,000 of your rate payers money.

300
00:28:27,864 --> 00:28:30,585
[SPEAKER_14]: And we haven't had public access TV during that period of time.

301
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:47,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, there's an approximate cost of, I believe, in the booklet that we received two weeks ago, of a cost of approximately $300,000, I think, and $26,000 to refurbish a particular part of the vocational school to have public access be up there and running.

302
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:49,675
[SPEAKER_14]: I may be off by a few dollars, but I think that's the dollar amount.

303
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:52,819
[SPEAKER_14]: With that being said, you know, it's a step.

304
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:54,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it a step in the right direction?

305
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully it is.

306
00:28:55,262 --> 00:29:00,770
[SPEAKER_14]: But the fact of the matter is that the old board of directors and the members of Channel 3 have been unaccounting

307
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:12,009
[SPEAKER_14]: are unaccountable for all the monies that they had not only in their inventory of assets, but also in their inventory of cash and deposits minutes to the meeting.

308
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:22,033
[SPEAKER_14]: And as Mr. Viglione indicated, um, our city solicitor has made numerous requests of those folks to submit the returns, um, to give our cash balances.

309
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:23,393
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the name of the bank accounts?

310
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,853
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have yet to receive that.

311
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:38,456
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that they filed a petition of dissolution back, I believe, in October of 2014, in 2013, excuse me.

312
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:41,276
[SPEAKER_14]: And to this day, we still have nothing.

313
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:43,837
[SPEAKER_14]: What it's going to take, I don't know.

314
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:50,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I would hope that the mayor would have been more aggressive in going after your money, because it is your money, as a rate payer.

315
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:55,865
[SPEAKER_14]: to a cable TV subscriber, Comcast, and now Verizon, that's an awful lot of money.

316
00:29:56,225 --> 00:29:57,506
[SPEAKER_14]: But we haven't had it for a while.

317
00:29:57,906 --> 00:30:04,550
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think if I understood the gentleman at the podium correctly, these are things that are part of our municipal government.

318
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:16,136
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you attach the name of Medfit on anything that a governmental entity or a non-governmental entity might do, but to take advantage of the city's name of Medfit, I think there is a sense of responsibility that we do have.

319
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:19,018
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would hope, Mr. President, under your leadership,

320
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:40,602
[SPEAKER_14]: there would be some sense of a committee meeting that would direct ourselves by way of maybe either policy or directing of the mayor to report back as it relates to these entities that use the name of Medfit to their advantage, but to the disadvantage of the people who are using, are playing, or a cable subscriber that unfortunately has the name of Medfit attached to it.

321
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:46,687
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think before you receive it and place it on file, there is a common understanding I think that needs to be made

322
00:30:47,259 --> 00:31:07,811
[SPEAKER_14]: to cable TV subscribers, because I think if they knew each and every month, Mr. President, that money was coming out of their cable bill since December of 2013 until now, and if they realize that the city is sitting on $356,000 of their money, and there was no public access station for all that period of time, I don't think that they would appreciate it, and I don't think a lot of people understand it, because it's just

323
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:14,270
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a small little notation on your cable bill, but it's there each and every month, whether it's 97 cents or a dollar something, whatever it might be.

324
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,031
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just wanted to say that.

325
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:29,016
[SPEAKER_24]: If I can comment, I'm under the impression that that amount that's been sitting dormant from all of our bills is actually a bit more, but I don't have an accurate rendering on that.

326
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:34,798
[SPEAKER_24]: And for all the money we pay in cable and there's nothing ever on TV, Mr. Councilor.

327
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,039
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

328
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:37,259
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

329
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:38,026
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

330
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:39,908
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on motion of Councillor Camuso.

331
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:43,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor?

332
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with Councillor Penter to the point.

333
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:53,999
[SPEAKER_11]: If people are going to use the name Medford, the city seal or anything of that nature, then the city should be a watchdog.

334
00:31:54,019 --> 00:32:02,826
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this has to be with websites that are out there, domain names and things of that nature too, because people do maliciously name Medford.

335
00:32:03,986 --> 00:32:06,507
[SPEAKER_11]: for different entities, including the gentleman that just spoke.

336
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:12,449
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe if we want to look at this, we'll look at anything that contains the name Medford and get ahold of it.

337
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:15,730
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to doing that under Councilor Pinter's recommendation at the subcommittee.

338
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:23,953
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we can send that to the appropriate subcommittee, once the subcommittees have been reorganized, we'll certainly bring that up.

339
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:25,873
[SPEAKER_24]: Gentleman is at the podium.

340
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:27,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Council President.

341
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:28,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me clarify.

342
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:46,114
[SPEAKER_10]: My petitions about non-profits that use the name Medford, anyone in this community who is a taxpayer and who is a resident can use the name Medford any way they want, as long as they're not wanting to overthrow the government or, you know, things of that nature.

343
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:50,315
[SPEAKER_10]: But come on, non-profits using the name Medford are what I spoke about.

344
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:56,469
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a certain individual on this council that likes to engage in subterfuge, and it is wrong.

345
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:03,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Non-profits using the land, using ballparks, have to be held accountable.

346
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:09,537
[SPEAKER_10]: And that individual that spoke up should have been the first person looking at the books, not enjoying benefiting from TV3.

347
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:12,419
[SPEAKER_10]: in violation of the Internal Revenue Code.

348
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:17,581
[SPEAKER_10]: So he ought to shut his mouth and let us do the city business that he doesn't want to do for that money.

349
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:21,623
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would appreciate him not speaking because for obvious reasons.

350
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:30,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, with all due respect, as long as as long as I'm sitting here, this individual I do not want in my life.

351
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll get a restraining order on him.

352
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:33,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Joe, good luck to you.

353
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's a lot of people out here that want him on you.

354
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:38,630
[SPEAKER_11]: So good luck to you in your future endeavors, Mr. Viglione.

355
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:43,873
[SPEAKER_11]: With all due respect, I'm just referring to what my council colleague said.

356
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:54,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing to do with the gentleman at the podium stated, but my council colleague actually said it eloquently, Councilor Penta, in any and all institutions and our endeavors that use the word Medford.

357
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:59,582
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's something that's wise, and I want to applaud Councilor Penta for expanding on the gentleman's views.

358
00:33:59,682 --> 00:34:01,683
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much, Councilor.

359
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:02,950
[SPEAKER_24]: Duly noted.

360
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:07,412
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Sir, state your name and address for the record, please.

361
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:08,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

362
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:11,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

363
00:34:11,873 --> 00:34:13,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

364
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:31,840
[SPEAKER_13]: I fully agree through the chair with Councillor Camuso that if this gentleman wants to look at things with the name Medford attached to it, even though he's not a nonprofit organization, he uses Medford Information Central.

365
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:42,484
[SPEAKER_13]: to go after people vehemently, and this reflects badly on the city of Medford when he uses the name Medford on it.

366
00:34:42,604 --> 00:34:44,405
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a disrespect to the city.

367
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:45,867
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be looked into.

368
00:34:46,227 --> 00:34:51,271
[SPEAKER_13]: For a quick example, he referred to City School Committee member Aaron DiBenedetto.

369
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,829
[SPEAKER_13]: And I won't repeat the name, in a derogatory name.

370
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:59,653
[SPEAKER_13]: If he's going to use Medford, he needs to represent Medford as a respectable city that it is.

371
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:02,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Councillor Camuso for bringing that up.

372
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:03,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

373
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:03,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, sir.

374
00:35:03,856 --> 00:35:06,418
[SPEAKER_13]: And will Councillor Carafiello.

375
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:07,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

376
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,061
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll yield to Mr. Viglione.

377
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,002
[SPEAKER_10]: inside Medford, Medford Transcript, the media, whether you like it or not, there's no free speech in this city.

378
00:35:18,462 --> 00:35:21,783
[SPEAKER_10]: No one can say ee, ooh, or boo about anything in this city.

379
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:27,645
[SPEAKER_10]: If you make a comment about money being stolen at West Medford Hillside Little League, oh my God.

380
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,191
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if you make a comment about Erin DiBenedetto, which is, she's a lovely person.

381
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:34,331
[SPEAKER_10]: School committee people are great.

382
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:39,752
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I disagree with her politics, we need an ombudsman for this city.

383
00:35:40,113 --> 00:35:43,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Cappucci doesn't like it because I explained his platform.

384
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:44,614
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very narrow.

385
00:35:44,754 --> 00:35:45,254
[SPEAKER_10]: God bless him.

386
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:46,214
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he's a great guy.

387
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,695
[SPEAKER_10]: But he wasn't ready for prime time to go after Senator Jalen.

388
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,255
[SPEAKER_10]: A very respected person.

389
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:52,955
[SPEAKER_10]: She got my vote.

390
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:57,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I voted Republican across the board this time, but Pat Jalen got my vote.

391
00:35:57,977 --> 00:35:58,677
[SPEAKER_10]: She's a good woman.

392
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:05,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford, if you want to have a magazine, and if Mr. Cappucci doesn't like it, he can create his own magazine.

393
00:36:05,738 --> 00:36:07,819
[SPEAKER_10]: But the nonprofits is what I wrote about.

394
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,879
[SPEAKER_10]: It is in the agenda.

395
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,681
[SPEAKER_10]: non-profits using the name Medford.

396
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:17,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get it straight.

397
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:25,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm glad that we had 250,000 hits tonight, a quarter of a million on medfordinformationcentral.blogspot.com.

398
00:36:25,486 --> 00:36:26,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad people are reading it.

399
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:30,549
[SPEAKER_10]: A quarter million hits, I must be doing something right, because no one's reading those other rags.

400
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:32,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Quick question for the gentleman at the podium.

401
00:36:33,784 --> 00:36:36,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'd just like to know, do you have press credentials?

402
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:41,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when other reporters come to this meeting, I notice they actually have credentials issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

403
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,873
[SPEAKER_24]: If we could address all of our remarks to the chair.

404
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:45,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize.

405
00:36:45,854 --> 00:36:47,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm published in eight books, sir.

406
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:48,256
[SPEAKER_11]: I just finished another book.

407
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:50,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have press credentials from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?

408
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:50,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes or no?

409
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:51,358
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very easy.

410
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,560
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my own press credentials, sir.

411
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,861
[SPEAKER_11]: From the Commonwealth?

412
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to talk to you, Paul Calusa, because you are a reprobate.

413
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:58,804
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll do my own research.

414
00:36:59,304 --> 00:36:59,565
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

415
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:00,505
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll do my own research.

416
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:06,765
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Caraviello, and then Councilor Knight.

417
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:08,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

418
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:12,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I've been involved in many nonprofits in the city for a long time.

419
00:37:12,808 --> 00:37:16,209
[SPEAKER_16]: I know some of my other colleagues on the council have been, and most of them are good.

420
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:25,493
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's been a few bad apples over the years, but I think you're seeing now people are being more responsible and where the money's being spent over the years.

421
00:37:25,573 --> 00:37:28,895
[SPEAKER_16]: And part of it comes from the same board being on there too long.

422
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:35,610
[SPEAKER_16]: And I say, I think now, a new day and age, people are asking questions where they never asked before.

423
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:41,555
[SPEAKER_16]: So don't condemn all the good organizations for those couple of bad ones.

424
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:42,176
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

425
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:53,105
[SPEAKER_24]: And as we all know, the Office of the Attorney General scrutinizes all the books of nonprofits, as well as all their filings and tax filings.

426
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:54,266
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor Knight.

427
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:58,648
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll yield my time to the gentleman at the podium, Mr. President.

428
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:00,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Counselor.

429
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:04,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, through the chair, thank you, Counselor Knight.

430
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:09,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Really briefly, on the issue of free speech, I'm not out to deny anybody's free speech.

431
00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:15,179
[SPEAKER_13]: We have certain inalienable rights, but with these rights comes responsibility.

432
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:22,203
[SPEAKER_13]: I have the freedom of speech right now to scream fire and scare everybody to run out, and that's a matter of free speech.

433
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:25,505
[SPEAKER_13]: But it would be highly irresponsible of me to do so.

434
00:38:26,063 --> 00:38:30,165
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is the point I'm trying to make with Medford Information Central.

435
00:38:31,506 --> 00:38:35,128
[SPEAKER_13]: The gentleman comes up, and he says, I have great respect for Aaron DiBenedetto.

436
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:41,652
[SPEAKER_13]: But then he calls her Aaron DiBenderover on his website.

437
00:38:42,672 --> 00:38:45,033
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mr. President, I agree with you.

438
00:38:45,354 --> 00:38:46,594
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't tolerate it either.

439
00:38:46,854 --> 00:38:51,237
[SPEAKER_13]: With freedom of speech comes responsibility into being adult.

440
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:55,128
[SPEAKER_13]: and represent our city in a respectable way.

441
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:56,369
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I'm asking for.

442
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:56,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

443
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:57,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

444
00:38:57,389 --> 00:38:58,130
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

445
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:04,014
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, I think that it's about time we move on the question.

446

[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso, as amended to receive and place on file.

447
00:39:09,998 --> 00:39:14,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I withdraw to receive and place on file.

448
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:20,523
[SPEAKER_24]: as amended to be sent to the appropriate committee.

449
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:29,785
[SPEAKER_24]: Once those committees have been that, um, Mr. President, may I be so bold to suggest that business and economic development be the appropriate committee that that'd be central.

450
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:35,026
[SPEAKER_24]: We're on the motion of council night that the paper would be sent to the business and economic development committee.

451
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:38,887
[SPEAKER_14]: There may be a new committee you may want to find.

452
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,727
[SPEAKER_14]: You may want to eliminate some committees.

453
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:44,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, at the present time, we adopted the standing rules of the committee.

454
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,448
[SPEAKER_26]: So those committees are presently,

455
00:39:45,952 --> 00:39:48,155
[SPEAKER_26]: enacted until we make a change to the rules of the standing rules.

456
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:50,938
[SPEAKER_24]: Your point of order is so noted and regarded.

457
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,143
[SPEAKER_24]: And so to that committee as indicated by Councilor Knight.

[SPEAKER_24]: So moved.

461
00:40:02,912 --> 00:40:06,516
[SPEAKER_24]: Folks, I know there's a number of you that want to speak here on a particular matter.

462
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:12,323
[SPEAKER_24]: We're just gonna tidy up one more piece of business and then we're gonna do that.

00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:13,816

521
00:43:14,236 --> 00:43:14,936
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

523
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:16,992
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Chief.

524
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:22,014
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, uh, Leo Sacco, police chief in the city of Medford.

525
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:24,075
[SPEAKER_21]: I live at two 27 Elm street in Medford.

526
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:30,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, I think it's appropriate at this time that, uh, members of the public present their concerns.

527
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:34,159
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm here to answer questions that may develop as a result of their concerns.

528
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:38,401
[SPEAKER_21]: And with me tonight, I have, uh, two representatives from Republic parking.

529
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:41,642
[SPEAKER_21]: I have Jack Skelton, who is one of the principals of the firm.

530
00:43:42,082 --> 00:43:44,523
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also have Dan Nash, who's a regional manager.

531
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:47,488
[SPEAKER_21]: who's overseeing the operation here in Medford at this point.

532
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:50,750
[SPEAKER_21]: So I yield to the, uh, to the public.

533
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:51,551
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, chief.

534
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:53,792
[SPEAKER_24]: And folks, just a kind word to you all.

535
00:43:53,892 --> 00:44:00,135
[SPEAKER_24]: I know this is a, uh, subject of great concern, uh, to so many of you here tonight.

536
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:08,560
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, just, uh, we like everything to be done in an orderly way as hopefully had been evidenced earlier.

537
00:44:09,132 --> 00:44:13,374
[SPEAKER_24]: and we allow you to come up and speak for no more than 10 minutes.

538
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:28,099
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think if my council colleagues will perhaps agree and bear with me, we'll allow the citizens to speak, and then the councilors will have their opportunity to interchange with the people and the officials present.

539
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:31,200
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

540
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Just before we get started, Mr. President, it would have been, in my opinion, helpful to have a public hearing

541
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:48,142
[SPEAKER_09]: prior to any negotiations, prior to any contact with the potential outside firm that's taking over parking management.

542
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:55,866
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have been helpful to have businesses, residents at the table before change could happen.

543
00:44:57,207 --> 00:45:03,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're at a point where the program's starting and we want to hear from residents and we want to hear from business owners.

544
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:06,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think this process has been

545
00:45:07,023 --> 00:45:09,538
[SPEAKER_09]: backwards, to be quite honest with you, Mr. President.

546
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:23,826
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm hoping that Chief Sackler's here tonight, and there's two gentlemen from Republic.

547
00:45:23,866 --> 00:45:30,509
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm hoping some of what takes place tonight, the comments that we hear, doesn't fall on deaf ears.

548
00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:41,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Because as we've seen just over the last couple of weeks, that the administration has made several major changes to his pay for parking proposal.

549
00:45:42,498 --> 00:45:46,199
[SPEAKER_09]: based on input, which should have been had months and months ago.

550
00:45:46,779 --> 00:46:04,162
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I, it's great that residents are coming up, but I hope that whatever stated that the mayor really takes into consideration and, uh, uh, if need be sit back down with Republican, the chief, uh, and I and out some of these major concerns we still exist was the president.

551
00:46:04,382 --> 00:46:06,062
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank you for giving me that opportunity.

552
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:06,562
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

553
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor Marks.

554
00:46:07,482 --> 00:46:10,763
[SPEAKER_24]: And also if I could, um, uh, just point out that, uh,

555
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:24,189
[SPEAKER_24]: Just before the meeting, a Park Medford parking information pamphlet was just published and distributed within the past day or so.

556
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,653
[SPEAKER_24]: And hopefully this will be distributed to the citizens of Medford.

557
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:30,934
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Penter, did you want to speak briefly?

558
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:35,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, one quick point before the citizens speak, and I think it has to be made clear.

559
00:46:35,738 --> 00:46:40,101
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford City Council did not vote for this paid park program.

560
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:53,772
[SPEAKER_14]: The council agenda of 14472 on May 20th of 2014 read as follows for the purposes of supporting the mayor to entertain or to engage in a 10-year contract and then report back.

561
00:46:54,253 --> 00:46:57,795
[SPEAKER_14]: But that resolution was amended.

562
00:46:58,175 --> 00:46:59,456
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is the exact words.

563
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:03,478
[SPEAKER_14]: And if anybody doubts what I'm saying, you can get a copy of the tape and watch it.

564
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:05,599
[SPEAKER_14]: The exact words are as follows.

565
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,181
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not the exact words that are in the minutes of the meeting.

566
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:10,162
[SPEAKER_14]: It says the following, to amend the motion

567
00:47:10,424 --> 00:47:14,807
[SPEAKER_14]: that the council meet before the signing so that we have a complete understanding.

568
00:47:15,228 --> 00:47:38,306
[SPEAKER_14]: And at that point, I was interrupted by city solicitor Rumbley, who then indicated by saying that he thought it would be a good idea to have the company and also show the council certain things about the machine and of end of quote, then I continued on to say, so as amended that having the major, the mayor, whoever the vendor might be to present themselves before the council before the finalization of the contract.

569
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:39,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Now,

570
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:45,057
[SPEAKER_14]: That is officially on our records of our meeting.

571
00:47:46,138 --> 00:47:52,145
[SPEAKER_14]: September 10th of this past year, the Memphis City Council met for the purposes of looking at a contract.

572
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:55,808
[SPEAKER_14]: right here, we've got two of them.

573
00:47:56,528 --> 00:47:59,029
[SPEAKER_14]: One we got in September and another one in October.

574
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,052
[SPEAKER_14]: The exact same contract a month apart with just one difference.

575
00:48:03,732 --> 00:48:13,897
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford City Council at that meeting on September 10th was met at that room by Medford citizens, certain members of the council, and questions as it relates to the contract that was being presented.

576
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:22,302
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford City Council never ever took a vote to finalize or giving the mayor the final authority for the purposes of engaging

577
00:48:22,622 --> 00:48:24,042
[SPEAKER_14]: in this pay-to-park program.

578
00:48:24,442 --> 00:48:35,225
[SPEAKER_14]: So what you have here right now and what you talk about right now is completely the Mayor McGlynn's pay-to-park program with no endorsement from the City of Medford's Council or any other elected official.

579
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:43,067
[SPEAKER_14]: It's his program and he owns it and unfortunately you're here tonight but whatever we can do to resolve it, this is the intent of the City Council.

580
00:48:43,307 --> 00:48:45,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately I wish the Mayor was here to listen to you

581
00:48:45,948 --> 00:48:49,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Like Councilman Mark said, it should have gone around to the entire community.

582
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:52,033
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a whole bunch of issues, and pitches don't lie.

583
00:48:52,093 --> 00:48:53,875
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a whole bunch of pitches, and I have comments.

584
00:48:53,915 --> 00:49:01,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I've received 106 emails from business people throughout this community in the last two days, because they're starting to find out about it.

585
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:14,031
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm willing to stay here all night, listen to whatever your comments are, and Chief, with all due respect, I think this is a bogus plan implemented upon the citizens, the business community, and the taxpayers of the city of Memphis.

586
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:23,470
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

587
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:28,172
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll now open up the podium to the citizens who wish to speak.

588
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:30,032
[SPEAKER_24]: Please approach the podium.

589
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:32,073
[SPEAKER_24]: You can line up if you'd like.

590
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:39,315
[SPEAKER_24]: And as you approach, if you could state your name and address clearly so that the clerk may make that part of the public record.

591
00:49:40,555 --> 00:49:42,455
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Gwendolyn Blackburn.

592
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:46,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 233 Arlington Street in West Medford.

593
00:49:48,877 --> 00:49:51,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations on becoming the president.

594
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:56,797
[SPEAKER_02]: and congratulations for being the vice president.

595
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:10,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I was coming before anybody was coming up here because I served on the committee with Councilor Marks.

596
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:12,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very happy.

597
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lived in Medford for 51 years.

598
00:50:15,317 --> 00:50:25,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever that there is something that I can do to help the city, I have been willing to serve and to help in any way possible.

599
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I served as an administrator in the Meffitt Public Schools for 32 years.

600
00:50:32,522 --> 00:50:34,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people, know a lot of kids.

601
00:50:36,304 --> 00:50:38,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always tried to do things the right way.

602
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:52,570
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was asked by the mayor to serve on a parking enforcement committee back in 2009, Councilor Marks, you have to help me, I'm getting old.

603
00:50:54,575 --> 00:51:05,922
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed to me like something I really would like to see happen because I felt that there were places certainly in the city where we needed to have enforcement, some enforcement.

604
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,805
[SPEAKER_02]: We went around to a lot of different places.

605
00:51:09,885 --> 00:51:16,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been down here before because Councilor Marks has been talking about what we did.

606
00:51:17,689 --> 00:51:23,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the nights that I thought it would come, it was either pouring rain, it was very cold or something.

607
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:45,218
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this point in time, with what is going on and what has happened, without any knowledge of the citizens, unless some of you got the knowledge that they were going to be putting these stanchions or whatever they are in the street, I thought it was important.

608
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,003
[SPEAKER_02]: The businesses are going to be suffering.

609
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,793
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a house on High Street, number 418.

610
00:51:54,973 --> 00:52:04,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it was my house, I would take a sledgehammer, and it would be on the ground by now, because it would be in front of that house.

611
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:08,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who went with these people, whoever they are.

612
00:52:09,784 --> 00:52:22,836
[SPEAKER_02]: and showed them places that these so-called kiosks, or whatever they are, who showed them where they should be, because they are in many inappropriate places.

613
00:52:23,636 --> 00:52:29,642
[SPEAKER_02]: The other part that happened, when we had our committee, we worked with the businesses.

614
00:52:30,142 --> 00:52:36,087
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a public meeting, and there was standing room right here in this council chamber.

615
00:52:36,788 --> 00:52:41,454
[SPEAKER_02]: The business people had an opportunity to tell us what they would like to see.

616
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:44,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And we made that report.

617
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:47,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the chief.

618
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:50,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to pick on you.

619
00:52:51,928 --> 00:53:00,551
[SPEAKER_02]: He was our chair, and he went with us to every city and town that we went to to see what their program was like.

620
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:03,352
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of good information.

621
00:53:03,912 --> 00:53:14,456
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought that it would be good to have some of the senior citizens, such as they have in Malden, to go around and do the parking enforcement.

622
00:53:15,616 --> 00:53:23,661
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point, when we did have an opportunity to have a conversation with the mayor, he spoke about a kiosk at that time.

623
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:32,106
[SPEAKER_02]: We said, no, we don't want kiosks unless, like Arlington, they're in parking lots.

624
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,721
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not what has happened.

625
00:53:35,021 --> 00:53:45,849
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought, on the street, we were opposed, and maybe not all of us, most of us on the committee, we were opposed to having kiosks on the street.

626
00:53:46,229 --> 00:53:56,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Have people come put money here or there or wherever, and then walk eight spots down the street so that you can go to, maybe you're going to, as he said,

627
00:53:57,997 --> 00:54:00,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Pastry, but it could be on the corner.

628
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:03,600
[SPEAKER_02]: We were opposed to all that.

629
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:13,504
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to have, and the businesses wanted to have some meters, and we agreed to talk about having meters on the street.

630
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:18,447
[SPEAKER_02]: The police officers, who have a lot of things to do,

631
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:29,674
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to do the enforcement, and that was fine, but we also felt that some of our senior citizens could do that as well.

632
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:34,718
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a situation now that I, from what I'm told,

633
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:39,000
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're stuck for 10 years with these things.

634
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,141
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even know anything about them.

635
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,782
[SPEAKER_02]: No one has contacted us.

636
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:54,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And whatever you have that's going to be mailed to us, people are being stopped on the street, and they're being told, you have to put money in these things.

637
00:54:54,947 --> 00:54:57,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know they're called kiosks, but I could call them something else.

638
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:10,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we have been really dealt a really bad hand at this point in time.

639
00:55:10,882 --> 00:55:18,169
[SPEAKER_02]: That we were not given the respect as citizens and taxpayers, and by the way, my tax bill went up again.

640
00:55:27,897 --> 00:55:32,782
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not being treated properly in this city.

641
00:55:33,723 --> 00:55:38,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to do something, don't talk to the citizens like our committee did.

642
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:48,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Our committee had the citizens, the public, come out so that they would have an input in what they wanted to see as parking enforcement in our city.

643
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:50,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't happen now.

644
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:58,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing we heard, we had kiosks or next thing I saw these things coming up around different places on the street.

645
00:55:58,907 --> 00:56:03,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's one up on the steps of the cemetery or right in front of the steps of the cemetery.

646
00:56:04,633 --> 00:56:07,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone up and down the street to see where I can find some.

647
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:10,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand.

648
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:19,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why people are being stopped now and told that they have to put money in these things when we have not even gotten any mail.

649
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:24,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had heard we were going to get a letter or some direction as to how it works.

650
00:56:25,143 --> 00:56:34,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also told that if you go down and talk to the mayor, if you have a place that you would not like to see it, go talk to the mayor, and the mayor will tell you, go see.

651
00:56:35,107 --> 00:56:36,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can't do anything about it.

652
00:56:37,328 --> 00:56:40,990
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get in touch with Republic or whoever they are.

653
00:56:41,391 --> 00:56:42,851
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they know about our city?

654
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:44,452
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a wonderful city.

655
00:56:44,472 --> 00:56:49,255
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a man up here last week, I believe, from West Medford who had a lot to say.

656
00:56:49,575 --> 00:56:53,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish I could have been here with him so I could have applauded what he had to say.

657
00:56:54,338 --> 00:56:59,301
[SPEAKER_02]: People move to Medford because of the kind of city that we have here.

658
00:56:59,982 --> 00:57:03,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And people move to West Medford because it's like the village.

659
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:16,847
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know how these businesses are going to stay in business with the way that this thing, of course, we don't really know how it's working because we haven't gotten that kind of information, but I guess it's coming.

660
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:28,531
[SPEAKER_02]: We have right here, I have brought along with us tonight the owner of one of the sub shops in West Mefford who has

661
00:57:30,536 --> 00:57:36,542
[SPEAKER_02]: petitions from people who signed in West Medford in his snapshot.

662
00:57:36,722 --> 00:57:39,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy, why don't you and your son come up and bring your petitions.

663
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:43,188
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give them to the city councilors.

664
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:49,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Jimmy, Jimmy Spirakis.

665
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,702
[SPEAKER_24]: If you're through Mrs. Blackburn speaking and wish to yield to this gentleman.

666
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:59,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to yield to him because he has pages of petitions.

667
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:01,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Please state your name and address for the record.

668
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:04,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Jimmy Spirakis.

669
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:07,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I own the block on High Street 501, 509 and also Jimmy's Pizza.

670
00:58:10,355 --> 00:58:11,255
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

671
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:18,077
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you have something to be distributed to the council members, you may give it to the messenger of the Medford City Council.

672
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:21,737
[SPEAKER_24]: And he is the duly appointed person to distribute.

673
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:29,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

674
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:30,239
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm the son of Jimmy.

675
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:31,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

676
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:32,499
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome.

677
00:58:33,299 --> 00:58:35,000
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you wish to share anything with the council?

678
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:35,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, uh,

679
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:39,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we disagree with this idea.

680
00:58:39,191 --> 00:58:48,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And every day, we hear customers who say, Jimmy, your business, I'm sorry, they're not going to be the same.

681
00:58:48,513 --> 00:58:55,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is very, you know, very bad decision to do mirrors.

682
00:58:55,315 --> 00:59:04,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And we come in for 10 minutes to pick up a pizza or something, and we go next door to a tailor just to bring a jacket, something.

683
00:59:04,517 --> 00:59:05,777
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's very bad.

684
00:59:06,662 --> 00:59:10,944
[SPEAKER_03]: And already today, two customers says, we walk over the place to the road.

685
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:12,485
[SPEAKER_03]: They walk the road.

686
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:13,586
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't drive their cars.

687
00:59:14,066 --> 00:59:15,446
[SPEAKER_03]: They come to pick up a pizza.

688
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:19,308
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I'm walk, and I'm going to use my car because I don't want to pay them money.

689
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:27,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, down the street for me, it's another block of businesses.

690
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:29,093
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a mirror over there.

691
00:59:29,854 --> 00:59:36,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, businesses, they're going to take from me because they're going to go all the way down because they don't have to pay.

692
00:59:37,753 --> 00:59:39,474
[SPEAKER_03]: They can buy pizza from other places.

693
00:59:39,835 --> 00:59:41,036
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no minute on the street.

694
00:59:45,379 --> 00:59:47,021
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think it's a good idea.

695
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be, actually, we need help.

696
00:59:50,744 --> 00:59:55,728
[SPEAKER_03]: The last two or three years, business is about 12% down West Medford.

697
00:59:56,408 --> 01:00:01,332
[SPEAKER_03]: We need some kind of help to increase the business.

698
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:03,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

699
01:00:04,595 --> 01:00:04,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

700
01:00:06,323 --> 01:00:06,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

701
01:00:07,723 --> 01:00:08,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm finished.

702
01:00:09,164 --> 01:00:09,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

703
01:00:09,724 --> 01:00:20,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm never finished, but I'll just stop because I think that we're in a bad situation, as far as I can tell, with these kiosks.

704
01:00:21,086 --> 01:00:22,106
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what they're called?

705
01:00:22,506 --> 01:00:22,766
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

706
01:00:22,826 --> 01:00:23,346
[SPEAKER_24]: Kiosks.

707
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:23,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

708
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:24,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Kiosks.

709
01:00:24,407 --> 01:00:30,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we've really done, or the person who made them possible

710
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:38,470
[SPEAKER_02]: have put our city in a bad, bad situation and the businesses in a bad, bad situation.

711
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:48,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would have been nice had there been respect given to the citizenry here so that everybody could have had input.

712
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:52,094
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it sounds like it's too late.

713
01:00:52,594 --> 01:00:53,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not going to give up.

714
01:00:54,335 --> 01:00:55,595
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll fight for 10 years.

715
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:05,865
[SPEAKER_24]: And folks, if you wish to speak, you just stand in the aisle and wait in line.

716
01:01:07,146 --> 01:01:09,668
[SPEAKER_24]: Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

717
01:01:09,688 --> 01:01:12,751
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio, Yale Street.

718
01:01:13,391 --> 01:01:14,872
[SPEAKER_05]: What number, Yale Street, sir?

719
01:01:15,113 --> 01:01:15,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 12.

720
01:01:15,373 --> 01:01:16,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 12, Yale Street.

721
01:01:16,834 --> 01:01:21,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And congratulations, President De La Russo and Madam Vice President on selection.

722
01:01:21,798 --> 01:01:23,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, my neighbor.

723
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:27,689
[SPEAKER_05]: congratulations on a good year last year from all the council members.

724
01:01:28,029 --> 01:01:35,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I didn't agree with everything you gentlemen and women came up with, but you're doing a great job out there and welcome back to the forefront.

725
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:35,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Camuso.

726
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:51,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, uh, I wrote a, uh, a small paper because I wanted to keep on track with what I want to say and some of the issues that have already been brought up, but I need to make,

727
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:58,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I need to make some statements.

728
01:01:58,712 --> 01:02:00,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I want these statements to be heard.

729
01:02:01,353 --> 01:02:23,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So forgive me if I am redundant and what somebody else has come up and said, but starting off, um, sir, if you could quiet down so that the speaker can be unimpeded, this parking program, as we know, it does not serve the best interests of the citizens.

730
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:35,636
[SPEAKER_05]: you represent, and in doing so, you've added a financial burden to our residents and our business community, not to mention a physical hardship for the disabled, seniors, and visitors to the city.

731
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:45,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not debate the logistical nightmare in the conception of this program, now known as Park Medford, because many questions still need to be answered.

732
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:53,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am hopeful that this honorable body will answer these questions respectfully, factually, and without prejudice.

733
01:02:54,226 --> 01:02:57,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Park Medford is not the answer to enforcement in this city.

734
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:02,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll say it again and again, this is a revenue program.

735
01:03:02,688 --> 01:03:04,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not an enforcement program.

736
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:09,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I am hopeful, well Park, I'm sorry, I got off the sign there.

737
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:10,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a bigger printing here.

738
01:03:12,929 --> 01:03:14,370
[SPEAKER_05]: It presents many problems.

739
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:21,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Among them are inaccuracies, ambiguities, favoritism, short-sightedness, and most glaring,

740
01:03:21,972 --> 01:03:33,799
[SPEAKER_05]: common sense and respect to our citizens, to the businesses, and to our men and women on the police department, including our traffic supervisors, all of whom are quite capable of doing the job.

741
01:03:34,499 --> 01:03:39,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuses about not being able to add to our public safety budget are just that.

742
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:50,849
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a sad state of affairs when the hard work, tireless efforts, and recommendations of Mr. Marks and Mrs. Blackburn and other members of the Traffic and Parking Study were totally ignored.

743
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:57,442
[SPEAKER_05]: due diligence was certainly missing and lacking in this presentation of this parking program.

744
01:03:58,462 --> 01:04:03,164
[SPEAKER_05]: One cannot orchestrate a tumultuous program such as this in the manner in which it was done.

745
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:09,407
[SPEAKER_05]: It appears most definitely there has been selective placement of kiosks.

746
01:04:09,987 --> 01:04:12,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Why no outcry from the Chamber of Commerce?

747
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,669
[SPEAKER_05]: For what purpose do they exist and for whom do they serve?

748
01:04:16,596 --> 01:04:22,520
[SPEAKER_05]: They stood by mutely and watched as certain businesses remained free and clear of kiosks, while other businesses did not.

749
01:04:23,981 --> 01:04:28,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Some politicians lack business experience and business sense, not all but some.

750
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:43,856
[SPEAKER_05]: But the smart ones, the ones who truly recognize it is their responsibility to work on behalf of the citizenry, will reach out and put the business paradigm on the table in an open forum, not behind closed doors at the expense of the taxpayer.

751
01:04:44,876 --> 01:04:45,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, for instance?

752
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:53,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And please take note that I am objectively pointing out examples, free of any animosity, and as neutral as I can be.

753
01:04:54,029 --> 01:04:56,090
[SPEAKER_05]: But I need to make this point by example.

754
01:04:56,771 --> 01:05:02,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do we place kiosks in the center of West Medford Square, but have none as you enter from Arlington?

755
01:05:03,135 --> 01:05:08,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Examples given, Joe's Peach and Charles Liquors, in the block of stores as you approach Boston Avenue.

756
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:14,283
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I received a text earlier today from Joan Gatto, who is the owner and proprietor of

757
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:16,026
[SPEAKER_05]: magnificent muffin.

758
01:05:16,366 --> 01:05:25,373
[SPEAKER_05]: She is out of town and wanted me to express her concern on this particular program, as well as the concern she has for her other business colleagues in the area.

759
01:05:26,474 --> 01:05:43,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Now to continue, I have to make a statement here and it is with all due respect and it concerns the placement and not placement of kiosks.

760
01:05:43,846 --> 01:05:45,846
[SPEAKER_05]: and several business establishments in the city.

761
01:05:47,207 --> 01:05:52,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been a long friend to the Dela Russo family in Medford.

762
01:05:54,108 --> 01:05:55,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I have questions.

763
01:05:56,709 --> 01:05:57,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

764
01:05:57,029 --> 01:06:01,970
[SPEAKER_05]: See, when I was growing up, a funeral parlor is solemn to me.

765
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:02,951
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a chapel.

766
01:06:03,991 --> 01:06:12,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Why they would place kiosks in front of certain places like in Sincardi's or Gaffey's,

767
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:18,408
[SPEAKER_05]: where there are other stores available in the area, and why none at other places?

768
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:20,969
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be none at all in any of these places.

769
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:23,349
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be no kiosks in the city of Medford.

770
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:29,491
[SPEAKER_05]: But the point I want to make is, who came up with this decision to put this here and that there?

771
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:40,553
[SPEAKER_05]: No kiosks on Main Street all the way from Medford Square to the corner of Wright Avenue and Yale Street, and then stopping at Wareham Street.

772
01:06:41,254 --> 01:06:42,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a small square.

773
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:47,161
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's, it's vulnerable to going out of business down there.

774
01:06:47,221 --> 01:06:53,442
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people that are, that are struggling, but yet there's convenience, convenient food markets that have none in front of them.

775
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:59,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I, I find it hard to believe that anybody would put a program together like that.

776
01:06:59,504 --> 01:07:06,186
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure that the people sitting on the council really didn't have much to do with the placement of the kiosk.

777
01:07:06,206 --> 01:07:06,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure.

778
01:07:06,846 --> 01:07:11,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they didn't, but I just don't understand the concept, the idea and how it was put together.

779
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:19,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think it's unconscionable that kiosks are put where people worship, where parents go to pick up their children at the library or at school.

780
01:07:19,632 --> 01:07:28,076
[SPEAKER_05]: And that two hour and less free parking is available in certain areas and other areas have kiosks and patrons who are required to pay.

781
01:07:29,997 --> 01:07:31,297
[SPEAKER_05]: No enforcement on Sundays.

782
01:07:31,697 --> 01:07:32,618
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another question.

783
01:07:33,038 --> 01:07:39,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Why wouldn't it be prudent to have no enforcement on Saturdays except for permitted streets?

784
01:07:39,561 --> 01:07:40,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Because on Saturday,

785
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:49,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the mom and pops, most of the small cash and carries, most of the hair salons, the nail salons, everybody that's in business, that's when they do a brisk business on a Saturday.

786
01:07:49,993 --> 01:07:51,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's home for the most part.

787
01:07:52,095 --> 01:07:53,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody is out shopping.

788
01:07:53,876 --> 01:07:55,637
[SPEAKER_05]: So why do they need to be punished to pay?

789
01:07:56,658 --> 01:07:59,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on Sunday, there's no enforcement.

790
01:08:01,282 --> 01:08:03,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's a fact for you to digest.

791
01:08:04,244 --> 01:08:10,268
[SPEAKER_05]: On Sunday spells disaster for our neighborhoods that have permit parking in opposition on the periphery

792
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,039
[SPEAKER_05]: of the smallest squares.

793
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:14,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Most businesses are closed.

794
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:23,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a family day, and we will have to put up with noise, more noise, incorrectly parked vehicles, blocked driveways, more garbage thrown on the streets and sidewalks.

795
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's trying to hold spaces for expected company.

796
01:08:28,086 --> 01:08:32,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this what we get for our tax dollars, a demise of our quality of life?

797
01:08:33,288 --> 01:08:37,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's a real eye-opener, and I don't get this one at all, a 7 a.m.

798
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,131
[SPEAKER_05]: start time for enforcement.

799
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did that come up from 7 o'clock?

800
01:08:43,932 --> 01:08:50,655
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people are on the road going to their jobs and typically stop at certain stores to grab a coffee, a scratch ticket, or some other commodity?

801
01:08:51,516 --> 01:08:53,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are certain businesses being punished?

802
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:55,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, they'll go someplace else, and who suffers?

803
01:08:56,018 --> 01:08:56,559
[SPEAKER_05]: We all do.

804
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:00,621
[SPEAKER_05]: This program is lacking true parking enforcement.

805
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:02,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you not see this?

806
01:09:03,162 --> 01:09:07,745
[SPEAKER_05]: In closing, I stand by my belief and on my own as a concerned citizen

807
01:09:08,283 --> 01:09:11,985
[SPEAKER_05]: in a former mayoral candidate and former business owner outside the city of Medford.

808
01:09:12,886 --> 01:09:13,546
[SPEAKER_05]: This is wrong.

809
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:14,827
[SPEAKER_05]: This is wrong.

810
01:09:15,247 --> 01:09:15,888
[SPEAKER_05]: This is wrong.

811
01:09:16,168 --> 01:09:16,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

812
01:09:23,972 --> 01:09:26,314
[SPEAKER_24]: Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

813
01:09:26,574 --> 01:09:30,556
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is, um, Millie Casicio and I live at 289 Elm Street.

814
01:09:32,557 --> 01:09:35,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know much about this.

815
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I only heard about this less than a week ago from some friends.

816
01:09:41,286 --> 01:09:44,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm pro or con the kiosk.

817
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:48,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've used one in Arlington.

818
01:09:49,214 --> 01:09:52,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used one in Belmont.

819
01:09:53,252 --> 01:09:59,055
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also, there's so many misinformation going on out there.

820
01:09:59,435 --> 01:10:02,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I had friends tell me, I go to the senior center sometimes.

821
01:10:04,478 --> 01:10:06,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, they were so upset.

822
01:10:06,259 --> 01:10:15,063
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, every time, I don't happen to do it, but there's some people, they go there every day for their lunch.

823
01:10:16,244 --> 01:10:22,667
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, like, oh, they're gonna have to pay to park when they go for lunch, and they can't, now not only,

824
01:10:23,948 --> 01:10:25,668
[SPEAKER_04]: paying after two hours.

825
01:10:26,448 --> 01:10:29,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, well, you know, a lot of places you have to pay after two hours.

826
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,629
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they have to move their cars.

827
01:10:31,709 --> 01:10:32,650
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to get this.

828
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:38,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, from what I talked to someone while I was waiting, they're not going to have to move their cars, are they?

829
01:10:39,551 --> 01:10:40,391
[SPEAKER_04]: After two hours.

830
01:10:41,651 --> 01:10:51,233
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that the, perhaps the most prudent thing would be once everyone's finished their remarks, the representatives of the parking management company

831
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:56,481
[SPEAKER_24]: and also the police chief of the city of Medford will explain things to you.

832
01:10:57,021 --> 01:11:02,562
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would suggest to you that they are the authoritative voice in these matters, rather than hearsay.

833
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:05,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, I know, but this is going all over the place.

834
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:09,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, oh, and what are these people going to do?

835
01:11:09,444 --> 01:11:10,044
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't go.

836
01:11:10,064 --> 01:11:16,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, well, maybe they just need to, you know, if they feel longer, they have to pay more money.

837
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:17,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?

838
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, they have to move the cars.

839
01:11:19,385 --> 01:11:22,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I doubt that, but I don't know.

840
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:31,948
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going to get this information now after the whole, you know, every, especially the senior center, they're all, like, going crazy.

841
01:11:32,028 --> 01:11:33,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what are we going to do?

842
01:11:33,908 --> 01:11:35,028
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to do?

843
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:42,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, like I said, I knew nothing of this until less than a week ago.

844
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,450
[SPEAKER_04]: But I knew this meeting was going to be here tonight.

845
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:50,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, let me go and see if I... And I've really, at this point, still not found out.

846
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:56,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who says this, who says that.

847
01:11:56,736 --> 01:12:04,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And I used to park, I worked for a while down towards the Seaport District, and it was a private

848
01:12:08,215 --> 01:12:10,336
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's how they were, you know.

849
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:16,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to go park my car, then I had to go to the kiosk, which half the time didn't work.

850
01:12:17,259 --> 01:12:23,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I had to pay, then I had to get that little ticket, then I had to go back and put it inside my car.

851
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:27,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it was pretty cold down there sometimes.

852
01:12:28,484 --> 01:12:31,365
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's all this misinformation going on.

853
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:36,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really why I'm here to say, you know, people have to know.

854
01:12:38,107 --> 01:12:42,469
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a friend that lives in Gloucester.

855
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,871
[SPEAKER_04]: They have like four seniors.

856
01:12:46,812 --> 01:12:48,052
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a problem for me.

857
01:12:48,212 --> 01:12:53,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't go that often, you know, and I can't get, but they have things for seniors.

858
01:12:54,887 --> 01:13:01,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the people that were talking to me were saying, no, they're going to have to move their car, and they're going to pay all their money.

859
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:05,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was talking to my friend, and I said, well, what are you doing?

860
01:13:05,092 --> 01:13:11,296
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, well, if you're a senior citizen, you go to, and I don't know, you get some kind of thing to stick on your car.

861
01:13:12,036 --> 01:13:12,417
[SPEAKER_04]: in that.

862
01:13:12,577 --> 01:13:17,602
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just the misinformation that's bothering me.

863
01:13:18,242 --> 01:13:19,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to sell this stuff.

864
01:13:19,624 --> 01:13:21,405
[SPEAKER_04]: When I got here, now I'm listening.

865
01:13:21,445 --> 01:13:25,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, ooh, this is even worse.

866
01:13:25,429 --> 01:13:28,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I have to say.

867
01:13:29,073 --> 01:13:29,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

868
01:13:29,754 --> 01:13:31,335
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much for coming up, ma'am.

869
01:13:37,659 --> 01:13:38,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Counselor.

870
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

871
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:44,524
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could have the chief of police or somebody from Republic answer that question.

872
01:13:44,564 --> 01:13:48,167
[SPEAKER_18]: I know other counselors probably got an email regarding the senior center.

873
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:52,090
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you elaborate on that so we can get those answers first?

874
01:13:52,411 --> 01:14:01,118
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the senior center was always a consideration because we know how many people park there on a given day to visit the center during various hours.

875
01:14:01,518 --> 01:14:06,742
[SPEAKER_21]: We've been trying to get the exact number or as close as possible to the exact number of vehicles involved.

876
01:14:07,308 --> 01:14:17,652
[SPEAKER_21]: and designate an area in that lot that would be free so that they could go have their lunch, participate in the activities, as well as some of the volunteers that work there that work with the seniors.

877
01:14:17,672 --> 01:14:19,913
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's, that's a work in progress.

878
01:14:19,953 --> 01:14:24,916
[SPEAKER_21]: As I said, two weeks ago at the council meeting regarding the parking, there's going to be a lot of fine tuning.

879
01:14:24,956 --> 01:14:28,057
[SPEAKER_21]: There's going to be a lot of tweaking as this goes along.

880
01:14:28,777 --> 01:14:35,060
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, and just based on my experience working with the, these gentlemen and others that are working, uh, staffing their office,

881
01:14:35,585 --> 01:14:43,847
[SPEAKER_21]: They're very agreeable, they're very easy to work with, and they don't want to hurt anyone, especially when it comes to the seniors and the senior parking.

882
01:14:44,427 --> 01:14:51,368
[SPEAKER_21]: But one thing the city has to get used to, for so many years, we've had free parking on the streets.

883
01:14:52,748 --> 01:15:03,451
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's come time that things had to change, because the amount of vehicles, the amount of traffic, and the amount of people that are abusing the free parking privileges had to change.

884
01:15:03,911 --> 01:15:05,111
[SPEAKER_21]: But as far as the seniors,

885
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:09,358
[SPEAKER_21]: There is a plan in place to designate the parking.

886
01:15:09,378 --> 01:15:13,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Just as a point of clarification, Chief, you said for years and years we've had a lot of what, free parking?

887
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:14,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

888
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:14,740
[SPEAKER_14]: On the streets.

889
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:15,221
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

890
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:24,324
[SPEAKER_14]: But we've also had an extreme lack of enforcement, and we wouldn't be here if the enforcement activity took place.

891
01:15:24,344 --> 01:15:28,746
[SPEAKER_21]: That's absolutely correct, Counselor, and I'll take some of the blame for that, that there's been a lack of enforcement.

892
01:15:28,786 --> 01:15:32,347
[SPEAKER_21]: But when we have to prioritize what we handle on a given day,

893
01:15:32,878 --> 01:15:42,165
[SPEAKER_21]: And the lack of steady, consistent enforcement, where we don't have the number of offices to dedicate to just go street to street and write tickets, that's part of the bigger problem, the bigger issue.

894
01:15:43,326 --> 01:15:45,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Since 2009, actually 2008 when the committee was formed,

895
01:15:48,491 --> 01:15:51,073
[SPEAKER_21]: We went around, we got ideas from other communities.

896
01:15:51,153 --> 01:15:59,700
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can remember every single time, no matter who I spoke to, whether it be in this building or in the community, they always use Somerville as an example.

897
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:03,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Granted, Somerville is very effective at what they do.

898
01:16:03,242 --> 01:16:05,444
[SPEAKER_21]: They generate $8 to $10 million a year.

899
01:16:06,305 --> 01:16:13,490
[SPEAKER_21]: But one thing we know we don't want is to be just like Somerville, where people are hiding behind bushes just to drop a ticket on a vehicle.

900
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:18,943
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that we have the good mix here with, with Republic and the involvement of the city.

901
01:16:19,563 --> 01:16:21,685
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, it's time.

902
01:16:21,985 --> 01:16:23,306
[SPEAKER_21]: And now the enforcement is coming.

903
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,867
[SPEAKER_21]: What was stated earlier about public meetings.

904
01:16:26,968 --> 01:16:36,914
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a public meeting as Mrs. Blackburn mentioned back in May of 2009 and the recommendations went forward from that to the mayor's office.

905
01:16:37,715 --> 01:16:38,976
[SPEAKER_21]: And that went in October of 2009.

906
01:16:39,676 --> 01:16:44,540
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of the recommendations was that some form of parking control device be on the street.

907
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,462
[SPEAKER_21]: And at that time, kiosks were mentioned.

908
01:16:47,923 --> 01:16:52,966
[SPEAKER_21]: And we know that there were some people that may not have been on the committee that favored kiosks.

909
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:55,248
[SPEAKER_21]: But the technology wasn't there.

910
01:16:55,548 --> 01:17:00,632
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we are five years later, or just about five years later, the technology has improved so much.

911
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:02,994
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's less damage on the street.

912
01:17:03,474 --> 01:17:07,397
[SPEAKER_21]: If you put single head meters all over the place, you'd be destroying the sidewalks up and down.

913
01:17:07,986 --> 01:17:11,088
[SPEAKER_21]: When it comes to snow removal, the meters and poles will be knocked down.

914
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:25,178
[SPEAKER_21]: When one kiosk can handle 10 or 12 vehicles, and you don't have to pay and display, you get the receipt, you put the receipt in your pocket, and you walk away, and you save that just as it is as a receipt, if in fact at some point you get a ticket.

915
01:17:25,759 --> 01:17:27,660
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's a lot of things that took place.

916
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:33,725
[SPEAKER_21]: But also, the Office of Community Development held a meeting in this room in March, and I believe it was March 31st,

917
01:17:34,865 --> 01:17:41,649
[SPEAKER_21]: 2010 a public meeting that asked for the public's involvement and input for parking needs in Medford square.

918
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:44,551
[SPEAKER_21]: So they asked the business community and they asked the public.

919
01:17:45,372 --> 01:17:47,994
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure of the attendance of that point of information.

920
01:17:48,074 --> 01:17:50,735
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor marks chief.

921
01:17:50,995 --> 01:18:00,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the issue is that when we had the public hearing back in 2009 it was to get input on eventually trying to create a parking management program in the city.

922
01:18:01,871 --> 01:18:06,933
[SPEAKER_09]: What people are asking now is there's been no and the mayor's pay for parking plan.

923
01:18:07,593 --> 01:18:09,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's been no public hearing chief.

924
01:18:09,533 --> 01:18:11,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you could talk about a second meeting.

925
01:18:12,014 --> 01:18:17,196
[SPEAKER_09]: That meeting wasn't regarding the mayor's plan that was being laid out chief at the time, if you recall.

926
01:18:17,476 --> 01:18:25,078
[SPEAKER_21]: No, but I think if you look at the recommendations that were submitted, almost every one of them has something to do with the program that's going forward this month.

927
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:30,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief pointed further clarification in the report that you folks submitted.

928
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:31,779
[SPEAKER_14]: on page number two.

929
01:18:32,428 --> 01:18:40,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Third paragraph, first line, if parking is a major problem in the city, then a necessary first step in taking that enforcement needs to be seriously taken.

930
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:48,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Last sentence, what was realized was the steady, consistent enforcement was necessary where all violations and violators were treated the same.

931
01:18:48,912 --> 01:18:57,334
[SPEAKER_14]: That's 2009, this is 2014, that's five years later, this mayor's been here and for five years he's done nothing about traffic enforcement.

932
01:18:57,634 --> 01:19:02,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Now he wants to beat the people up and make this a revenue enhancement program and that's

933
01:19:02,615 --> 01:19:09,579
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not what the report's about.

934
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:15,842
[SPEAKER_21]: All I can say is going forward from that 2009 report, we did recommend some form of meter control on the streets.

935
01:19:15,862 --> 01:19:17,523
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the number one?

936
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:19,244
[SPEAKER_21]: Recommendation number four, I believe.

937
01:19:20,724 --> 01:19:21,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chief.

938
01:19:21,725 --> 01:19:22,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Camuso.

939
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:23,106
[SPEAKER_11]: To the Chief.

940
01:19:23,146 --> 01:19:24,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Waited patiently.

941
01:19:24,686 --> 01:19:25,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chief.

942
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:28,528
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just a little confused because I'm hearing some different things.

943
01:19:30,296 --> 01:19:30,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

944
01:19:30,496 --> 01:19:39,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Blackburn, well respected in our community, her years of service in the school department, Councilor Marks, yourself, Marguerite Lynch, Anthony Santoro sat on the original committee back in 2009.

945
01:19:40,021 --> 01:19:42,242
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

946
01:19:42,302 --> 01:19:43,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, 2008 into 2009.

947
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:47,244
[SPEAKER_11]: And I went back to some of my old archive records.

948
01:19:48,245 --> 01:19:54,968
[SPEAKER_11]: The recommendations were the agreement consensus that consistent parking enforcement is needed to provide efficient turnover.

949
01:19:55,386 --> 01:19:57,772
[SPEAKER_11]: for pocket spaces to assist the local businesses.

950
01:19:58,233 --> 01:20:01,861
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the members actually was on there as a representative of the Chamber of Commerce at the time.

951
01:20:02,262 --> 01:20:04,287
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like any other agency or group.

952
01:20:04,977 --> 01:20:07,938
[SPEAKER_11]: turn over, so that's who was sitting there at the time.

953
01:20:07,978 --> 01:20:15,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two was this particular group recommended parking controls are needed, meters slash kiosks, freestanding pay stations.

954
01:20:15,621 --> 01:20:17,681
[SPEAKER_11]: That was number two for the recommendations.

955
01:20:18,142 --> 01:20:21,543
[SPEAKER_11]: And it goes on to say that the parking rules must be fair and consistently enforced.

956
01:20:23,283 --> 01:20:24,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Now this was back in 2009.

957
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Leading up to this, I know there was a first bid that went out

958
01:20:28,798 --> 01:20:34,442
[SPEAKER_11]: that consisted of parking enforcement with a parking garage element at Medford Square.

959
01:20:35,082 --> 01:20:38,945
[SPEAKER_11]: There wasn't the votes on the Medford City Council to support the garage at the time.

960
01:20:39,305 --> 01:20:43,928
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually have members that don't even sit on the council anymore that were here for that particular.

961
01:20:45,638 --> 01:20:59,714
[SPEAKER_11]: those particular discussions and I would have rather have seen the garage built with strict enforcement and then look at other areas but as far as all the recommendations it looks like a lot of them

962
01:21:00,515 --> 01:21:01,516
[SPEAKER_11]: are with this plan.

963
01:21:01,896 --> 01:21:12,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Now leading up to that, one thing that I disagree with totally on the mayor's plan is, and I said this at the Committee of the Whole meeting back in January, I would have rather seen the freestanding meters.

964
01:21:12,903 --> 01:21:14,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I think senior citizens know how to use them.

965
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:27,073
[SPEAKER_11]: They're much more, they're much more user-friendly, but I also see the total other side of it where, up near Tufts University now,

966
01:21:28,165 --> 01:21:35,150
[SPEAKER_11]: People that are living in our community and utilizing up there, everyone, they don't even go into a coffee shop without cash anymore.

967
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:37,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything is debit card, credit card driven.

968
01:21:38,373 --> 01:21:43,717
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is the technology out there that could be standalone meters with kiosks.

969
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:47,140
[SPEAKER_11]: And I made that loud and clear known at the meeting in January.

970
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:50,342
[SPEAKER_11]: It was actually part of the committee report that was adopted.

971
01:21:50,622 --> 01:21:52,104
[SPEAKER_11]: But as I said that evening,

972
01:21:52,842 --> 01:22:20,637
[SPEAKER_11]: we're making recommendations to the mayor and ultimately this council gave him the authority to go out and up to a ten-year contract by a seven to nothing vote uh... and it leads us back to ultimately given the fact that he's the mayor duly elected by the majority of this community he is the signatory authority uh... at moving any contracts forward so uh... that was really the only piece that this city council had a hand in what i'd like to see them go the route with the

973
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,361
[SPEAKER_11]: quarter meters that you just throw in that people have been using.

974
01:22:24,701 --> 01:22:30,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember the quarter meters over in Somerville or over in Charlestown when we were little kids going to get shoes.

975
01:22:30,544 --> 01:22:32,004
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd throw a quarter in the meter back then.

976
01:22:32,524 --> 01:22:33,425
[SPEAKER_11]: People knew how to use them.

977
01:22:33,445 --> 01:22:34,485
[SPEAKER_11]: They're so user friendly.

978
01:22:34,945 --> 01:22:43,309
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just think there could have been more public, leading up to this now, the rollout I think could have been publicized more.

979
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:45,390
[SPEAKER_11]: This piece of paper is very informative.

980
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it should have been in the hands a little bit sooner.

981
01:22:48,405 --> 01:22:52,547
[SPEAKER_11]: The other recommendation I would have liked to have seen is started it not in the middle of the winter.

982
01:22:53,127 --> 01:22:55,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Start it when it's nice out so that people could go up to a machine.

983
01:22:55,949 --> 01:23:01,912
[SPEAKER_11]: And right now, I mean, I couldn't even carry my tea in tonight because it was so cold going from the car to here.

984
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:07,975
[SPEAKER_11]: If I had to run to a kiosk, I'd rather just get the ticket and pay it, I think, because it was so cold out there.

985
01:23:08,335 --> 01:23:10,076
[SPEAKER_11]: But the fact of the matter is,

986
01:23:11,525 --> 01:23:16,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the city has to continue doing outreach, utilizing the 911.

987
01:23:17,772 --> 01:23:20,915
[SPEAKER_11]: We get phone calls to say they just put the chalk lines on the baseball field.

988
01:23:22,136 --> 01:23:24,599
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something big that we should be getting three or four calls on.

989
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:26,901
[SPEAKER_11]: The outreach, the outreach, the outreach.

990
01:23:28,985 --> 01:23:32,828
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing that I'd like to bring up is just to say how we got here.

991
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:38,672
[SPEAKER_11]: This was an initial recommendation of several members of our community that had many recommendations.

992
01:23:39,213 --> 01:23:44,396
[SPEAKER_11]: And after it went from here, the original commission, yourself, Councilor Marks, Ms.

993
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:47,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Blackburn, and other people, at that point, it was in the hands of the mayor.

994
01:23:48,519 --> 01:23:49,160
[SPEAKER_11]: And it sat there.

995
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:55,044
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it came back to us at one portion just to give the authority to do the 10-year contract.

996
01:23:56,853 --> 01:24:07,835
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanna be clear to the people out there that, and you gotta remember too, the last time the halls were this, it was over the trash removal and the recycling bins.

997
01:24:09,396 --> 01:24:12,116
[SPEAKER_11]: But given time, people did get in the groove.

998
01:24:12,136 --> 01:24:25,239
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to think that the individual needs of areas like Jimmy's Pizza, areas like the senior center, I'm not singling out Jimmy's Pizza, but you know, the business communities in South Medford.

999
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:28,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's be cognizant when we're putting in those free spaces.

1000
01:24:28,836 --> 01:24:30,082
[SPEAKER_11]: If we have to add a couple more.

1001
01:24:30,897 --> 01:24:34,019
[SPEAKER_11]: so that people can run in and do their business and get out right away.

1002
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:42,545
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll be the first one to say, the person that takes that spot for 15 minutes, if it's a 15-minute spot to do a quick errand, and they're there 16 minutes, shame on them.

1003
01:24:42,585 --> 01:24:46,868
[SPEAKER_11]: They should get double the ticket, because the next person should have the 15 minutes and the 15 minutes.

1004
01:24:48,409 --> 01:24:50,951
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd just like to get a commitment.

1005
01:24:51,631 --> 01:24:55,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a commitment, I understand you can't, but that things will be tweaked and looked at.

1006
01:24:56,495 --> 01:24:59,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there is stuff, like you said, the senior center, just last week,

1007
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:01,848
[SPEAKER_11]: that was thought about.

1008
01:25:01,868 --> 01:25:04,230
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's going to be other areas that you think about.

1009
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:09,675
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing that's very, very important, places of worship in all the funeral parlors in our community.

1010
01:25:10,035 --> 01:25:11,436
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually did some research on this.

1011
01:25:12,217 --> 01:25:20,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Those meters, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think this is very important for the people in our community that practice their faith and their religious beliefs.

1012
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,301
[SPEAKER_11]: venues that they will be bagged.

1013
01:25:24,481 --> 01:25:31,084
[SPEAKER_11]: There'll be an actual bag or something all over it on the weekends that says, uh, masks don't whatever the case may be.

1014
01:25:31,304 --> 01:25:34,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And the mayor has assured me that that will take place.

1015
01:25:34,086 --> 01:25:35,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you under that impression as well?

1016
01:25:35,206 --> 01:25:37,487
[SPEAKER_11]: They're bagged or they're just not enforced during that time.

1017
01:25:37,808 --> 01:25:42,950
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been assured that any of the wakes, any funerals, the consideration will be given.

1018
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:46,412
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, Rhonda Franzo was, uh,

1019
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:52,402
[SPEAKER_21]: an unofficial committee member.

1020
01:25:52,583 --> 01:26:00,748
[SPEAKER_21]: He was aware of what was going forward and he's been totally agreeable as long as he could be assured that if he had a service going on at his facility.

1021
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,721
[SPEAKER_21]: that it would be okay.

1022
01:26:02,861 --> 01:26:05,684
[SPEAKER_21]: And as I said before, the Republic folks are good about that.

1023
01:26:06,344 --> 01:26:07,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Not a problem with that.

1024
01:26:07,225 --> 01:26:09,547
[SPEAKER_21]: Not a problem at school pickup for St.

1025
01:26:09,567 --> 01:26:12,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Joseph's, uh, drop off and pick up at St.

1026
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:13,190
[SPEAKER_21]: Joseph's.

1027
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:16,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Any of those things are more of a common sense way of doing the business.

1028
01:26:17,374 --> 01:26:28,964
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other thing that, um, that I'm glad the mayor listened to this council on, cause I actually made a recommendation, um, back when we had another piece of this whole puzzle, the other area where the city council was involved, it was the language.

1029
01:26:29,403 --> 01:26:35,726
[SPEAKER_11]: to combine two of the commissions and give the authority to one commission rather than an off-street parking commission and a traffic commission.

1030
01:26:36,046 --> 01:26:38,047
[SPEAKER_11]: You get too many hands in the soup, the soup gets spoiled.

1031
01:26:38,487 --> 01:26:44,330
[SPEAKER_11]: So we successfully, as a council, passed that, sent it to the state house, the governor signed it, and it came back.

1032
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:50,784
[SPEAKER_11]: But one recommendation that I made, and it's in the official records, were to have resident parking only commuters.

1033
01:26:51,244 --> 01:26:58,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Because too many people from Winchester, not only some of them are coming down here and taking spots, they're leaving their trash in our trash barrels because they have to go to dump in Winchester.

1034
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:00,350
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is totally unacceptable.

1035
01:27:00,811 --> 01:27:07,295
[SPEAKER_11]: And quite honestly, it's larceny, as far as I'm concerned, or illegal dumping, because it's our taxpayers that are footing the bill on that.

1036
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,677
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is up to this point.

1037
01:27:10,237 --> 01:27:11,718
[SPEAKER_11]: I do see some tweaking getting done.

1038
01:27:12,198 --> 01:27:23,125
[SPEAKER_11]: which I think people have to understand that this is slow process, similar to the trash barrel situation where I had more phone calls on the trash barrel, similar to this situation, and how many people were going to need three, four, five barrels.

1039
01:27:23,545 --> 01:27:28,388
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you talk to the DPW, there's not many households that actually purchased the additional barrel at the time.

1040
01:27:28,828 --> 01:27:35,112
[SPEAKER_11]: But in Winchester, Winchester is totally expanding their program right now.

1041
01:27:36,282 --> 01:27:36,843
[SPEAKER_11]: as we speak.

1042
01:27:37,323 --> 01:27:42,150
[SPEAKER_11]: They just put their brand new kiosks in Winchester Center, and actually our kiosks are better.

1043
01:27:43,652 --> 01:27:47,216
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't used one yet, but at least the numbers are bigger.

1044
01:27:47,537 --> 01:27:49,459
[SPEAKER_11]: In Winchester, the keypad is tiny.

1045
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:50,832
[SPEAKER_11]: It's tiny.

1046
01:27:50,892 --> 01:27:57,557
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know this, this council wanted to make sure that everything was ADA compliant and the mayor is very serious when it comes to that stuff too, as, as yourself.

1047
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:01,320
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, that's, that's all I really have to say at this point.

1048
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:10,487
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, I just, what I stated regarding the initial report, pretty fairly accurate because I'm hearing different things that, that that committee never wanted kiosk meters.

1049
01:28:10,547 --> 01:28:13,549
[SPEAKER_11]: But now when you look at it, it's actually one of the recommendations.

1050
01:28:14,049 --> 01:28:17,872
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just, just, just to clarify that piece, I think initially the committee itself,

1051
01:28:19,071 --> 01:28:21,792
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, we were looking at, okay, we had a lot of signage out there.

1052
01:28:21,812 --> 01:28:22,852
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a lot of time limit.

1053
01:28:22,892 --> 01:28:28,214
[SPEAKER_21]: We could have done time limit enforcement, but every community we went to, they had some form of device on the street.

1054
01:28:28,274 --> 01:28:32,895
[SPEAKER_21]: And most of them had the meters at the time because the kiosks weren't as reliable as they are today.

1055
01:28:33,816 --> 01:28:46,720
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, but when we had the public meeting, I'm not sure if you have that piece of that document when we had the public meeting, the majority of people, if not, I think barring two people who were in attendance that night, a lot of support,

1056
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:54,166
[SPEAKER_21]: all wanted some sort of meters or some sort of control on the streets and then enforcement of those meters.

1057
01:28:54,927 --> 01:28:59,271
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have the notes here that Alvar Erickson had typed up from that meeting.

1058
01:28:59,331 --> 01:29:05,177
[SPEAKER_21]: And almost everyone, there were two that were against meters and parking enforcement in total.

1059
01:29:05,797 --> 01:29:08,339
[SPEAKER_21]: And everybody else wanted to see some sort of

1060
01:29:09,564 --> 01:29:12,606
[SPEAKER_21]: control device on the street, whether it be a meter, whether it be a kiosk.

1061
01:29:12,626 --> 01:29:14,367
[SPEAKER_21]: And at the time, the push was meters.

1062
01:29:14,627 --> 01:29:17,028
[SPEAKER_21]: The push was meters, because we didn't know what a kiosk was.

1063
01:29:17,048 --> 01:29:20,450
[SPEAKER_21]: So that was what it was at the time.

1064
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:21,911
[SPEAKER_21]: But now, you know, time has passed.

1065
01:29:21,951 --> 01:29:25,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we are almost five years later, and the technology has improved so much.

1066
01:29:26,274 --> 01:29:27,654
[SPEAKER_21]: And the kiosk gives you — The Press.

1067
01:29:28,195 --> 01:29:30,016
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, Counselor Marks.

1068
01:29:30,596 --> 01:29:35,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure that Counselor Camuso just outlined the process since 2009.

1069
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:39,021
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe just unintentionally,

1070
01:29:39,598 --> 01:29:43,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Between 2009 and today, the mayor appointed another committee.

1071
01:29:44,721 --> 01:29:45,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, City Hall employees.

1072
01:29:45,722 --> 01:29:48,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that hasn't been mentioned at all.

1073
01:29:48,604 --> 01:29:49,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because it's his ball, I say.

1074
01:29:49,604 --> 01:29:52,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm just saying, the mayor appointed another committee.

1075
01:29:52,786 --> 01:29:55,408
[SPEAKER_09]: That committee consisted of all his department heads.

1076
01:29:55,468 --> 01:29:55,828
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that.

1077
01:29:56,249 --> 01:30:05,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So not one person, I didn't sit on the committee, Gwen didn't sit on the committee, Ron DeFranco didn't sit on the committee, Anthony Santoro didn't sit on the committee.

1078
01:30:05,415 --> 01:30:06,775
[SPEAKER_09]: These were department heads.

1079
01:30:07,196 --> 01:30:08,697
[SPEAKER_09]: And the mayor devised a plan.

1080
01:30:09,717 --> 01:30:18,083
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think it's accurate to sit back and say, based on recommendations that were made five years ago, that this is how the mayor went forward.

1081
01:30:18,403 --> 01:30:19,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's not what took place.

1082
01:30:20,144 --> 01:30:24,948
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor went forward working in a vacuum in his office with his department heads.

1083
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:27,349
[SPEAKER_09]: with no input from anyone.

1084
01:30:27,369 --> 01:30:28,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what we're seeing here tonight.

1085
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:29,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I stated that.

1086
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:31,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you might have stated that, but you've been supporting this from day one.

1087
01:30:31,651 --> 01:30:33,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, all of a sudden, you're giving it a change of heart.

1088
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:33,992
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

1089
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor, it's not a recommendation to bring leaders in.

1090
01:30:35,413 --> 01:30:36,074
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got a crowd up here.

1091
01:30:36,094 --> 01:30:37,174
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to change your heart now.

1092
01:30:37,374 --> 01:30:41,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor, with all due respect, I took the same exact votes in this whole program as you and every other member of this council.

1093
01:30:41,757 --> 01:30:43,698
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Mr. President, just if I could finish.

1094
01:30:43,718 --> 01:30:45,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Clarification is our issue.

1095
01:30:45,118 --> 01:30:46,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Just if I could point.

1096
01:30:46,459 --> 01:30:53,763
[SPEAKER_09]: The two major issues with this is that when we as a committee met, and Gwen can speak for herself,

1097
01:30:54,523 --> 01:31:01,125
[SPEAKER_09]: When we discussed about who was gonna do the enforcement, every discussion was in-house personnel.

1098
01:31:01,545 --> 01:31:04,726
[SPEAKER_09]: It was our crossing guards, it was retired police.

1099
01:31:05,146 --> 01:31:08,667
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor took the proposal and outsourced 95% of this.

1100
01:31:08,987 --> 01:31:11,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a major part that the mayor changed.

1101
01:31:12,287 --> 01:31:12,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Major part.

1102
01:31:13,408 --> 01:31:14,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Just my other point.

1103
01:31:15,685 --> 01:31:20,747
[SPEAKER_09]: The other point, as the Chief mentioned, and Ron DeFranco, who's on the committee, also mentioned, and Gwen mentioned.

1104
01:31:20,807 --> 01:31:21,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Ron DeFranco was not on the committee.

1105
01:31:22,107 --> 01:31:23,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, he was on the committee.

1106
01:31:23,048 --> 01:31:24,148
[SPEAKER_09]: He was an ex-officio member.

1107
01:31:24,168 --> 01:31:24,908
[SPEAKER_09]: He was on the committee.

1108
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:27,289
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't attend any of the meetings, so don't talk like you did.

1109
01:31:27,309 --> 01:31:28,990
[SPEAKER_09]: You're the one that brought the meetings to the city.

1110
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:29,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't talk like you've been there.

1111
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:31,311
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could make this point.

1112
01:31:31,471 --> 01:31:33,372
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could, Mr. President.

1113
01:31:33,612 --> 01:31:42,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second big issue, one was the outsourcing, and the second was that we as a committee wanted steady enforcement, parking enforcement,

1114
01:31:42,835 --> 01:31:44,235
[SPEAKER_09]: with the existing signage.

1115
01:31:44,615 --> 01:31:49,497
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor took that around, wrapped it around, and made it a pay for parking enforcement.

1116
01:31:49,917 --> 01:31:58,379
[SPEAKER_09]: So the two major components were thought up in the mayor's committee with his department heads and had nothing to do with our committee.

1117
01:31:58,619 --> 01:32:02,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a committee member that was here tonight that can attest to that.

1118
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ron DeFranco mentioned that.

1119
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:12,602
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't like the fact that the mayor is looking now for a scapegoat to blame anyone on this parking when he should look in the mirror and he can see himself, Mr. President.

1120
01:32:13,142 --> 01:32:16,825
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1121
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:20,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Camuso, if you'd like to complete your remarks.

1122
01:32:20,287 --> 01:32:20,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1123
01:32:20,647 --> 01:32:21,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I can conclude with two things.

1124
01:32:21,788 --> 01:32:29,153
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to follow up on what Councillor Mack said, and I did say that after the recommendations came by his committee for all these recommendations, it was in the mayor's hands.

1125
01:32:29,573 --> 01:32:31,354
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the signatory authority and the only one.

1126
01:32:31,814 --> 01:32:36,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And to say that I supported it and now I'm not, we all supported it.

1127
01:32:36,237 --> 01:32:39,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven members of this council gave, had our- I didn't support this language.

1128
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,141
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't have- I didn't support this language.

1129
01:32:43,217 --> 01:32:45,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Penta, if you could make a point of clarification.

1130
01:32:45,999 --> 01:32:55,184
[SPEAKER_14]: All the council voted for was to authorize the mayor to go forward and look into a 10-year contract because we had three people come.

1131
01:32:55,665 --> 01:32:57,406
[SPEAKER_14]: All three of them had a 10-year proposal.

1132
01:32:57,546 --> 01:33:02,889
[SPEAKER_14]: It was over a three-year minimum for which the procurement officer said these are what the people had to come in with.

1133
01:33:03,607 --> 01:33:10,829
[SPEAKER_14]: and the council voted with an amendment that the council meet before the signing so that we have a complete understanding.

1134
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:20,311
[SPEAKER_14]: And I further amended it by saying that having the mayor, whoever the vendor might be, present themselves before the council before the finalization of the contract.

1135
01:33:20,551 --> 01:33:25,552
[SPEAKER_14]: So before the finalization of the contract to me means before that contract is signed.

1136
01:33:25,812 --> 01:33:32,814
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we don't agree or something has to be changed, we never have the opportunity to take the vote or discuss anything about a finalization.

1137
01:33:33,754 --> 01:33:37,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And, I tell you, it's on the record.

1138
01:33:37,816 --> 01:33:40,236
[SPEAKER_14]: It's clearly on the record, as clear as the bell.

1139
01:33:40,697 --> 01:33:41,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Padgett.

1140
01:33:42,077 --> 01:33:44,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso has the floor, and then Councilor Caraviello.

1141
01:33:44,998 --> 01:33:46,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Just two last things.

1142
01:33:46,659 --> 01:33:50,560
[SPEAKER_11]: In the last few days, I had several members of our community reach out to me about the signs on the trees.

1143
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:57,863
[SPEAKER_11]: I worked with the DPW today, as well as the Mayor's office, and all the signs have been removed from the trees, and

1144
01:33:58,803 --> 01:34:02,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, I know Councilor Marks over the years, this has been something he's been a stickler about.

1145
01:34:02,785 --> 01:34:07,607
[SPEAKER_11]: But some of the existing signs that were, they took down and put them over that.

1146
01:34:07,847 --> 01:34:09,207
[SPEAKER_11]: They were never removed in the first place.

1147
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:12,909
[SPEAKER_11]: So shame on the city for allowing them to linger up there.

1148
01:34:13,549 --> 01:34:14,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of clarification.

1149
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:15,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Further clarification.

1150
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:16,451
[SPEAKER_15]: On that particular motion.

1151
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:24,099
[SPEAKER_14]: On that particular issue, excuse me, I have pictures of every tree that was bolted by a sign.

1152
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:31,161
[SPEAKER_14]: If the mayor was on top of his game, they would have known right from the beginning never to put a sign on a tree to start off with.

1153
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:31,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1154
01:34:32,521 --> 01:34:35,042
[SPEAKER_14]: There was no communication, not even with the mayor to them.

1155
01:34:36,062 --> 01:34:42,904
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not yelling at you because you know something, this is such a disruptive piece of legislation that we shouldn't even be discussing this.

1156
01:34:43,224 --> 01:34:45,964
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor should be in here apologizing and saying,

1157
01:34:53,227 --> 01:35:14,676
[SPEAKER_11]: last but not least we have business owners in this community that have consistently parked their vehicles in front of their stores year after year after year and you know what the only people that suffer are them and the consumers when they pull up and they have to park three miles away because you got an ice cream store or you have a vendor

1158
01:35:15,741 --> 01:35:17,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they don't even try to disguise it.

1159
01:35:17,943 --> 01:35:22,608
[SPEAKER_11]: The name of the companies on the side of the truck that sits out there all day long, or the car that sits out there all day long.

1160
01:35:23,188 --> 01:35:36,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, I think today driving through the squares, I think some of the business owners now are taking the appropriate steps to leave the spots for the consumers, like us, when we show up.

1161
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:42,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're already seeing an impact, because you got good business in the community, like the guys that are sitting out here.

1162
01:35:43,543 --> 01:35:48,826
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll go deliver some food and then park their car half a mile away so that somebody can park in front of their store.

1163
01:35:49,347 --> 01:35:52,528
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not many people that do that, I hate to say, throughout our squares.

1164
01:35:52,849 --> 01:35:57,411
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's obvious, because half the trucks are leaded that say the name of the business and everything else.

1165
01:35:58,112 --> 01:35:59,192
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's it for now.

1166
01:35:59,552 --> 01:36:01,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Counselor Kamuso.

1167
01:36:02,054 --> 01:36:03,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Karifiello.

1168
01:36:03,715 --> 01:36:04,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1169
01:36:05,016 --> 01:36:07,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Chief, a couple of concerns I have.

1170
01:36:07,952 --> 01:36:11,235
[SPEAKER_16]: timeframe, uh, who decided on seven to seven?

1171
01:36:12,236 --> 01:36:14,458
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I don't see many communities.

1172
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:19,203
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll stab at the seven to seven piece only because I believe that's what the existing signage had said.

1173
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:26,190
[SPEAKER_21]: And that just any signs that were replaced were replaced with the, uh, the wording of pretty much of the existing signage.

1174
01:36:28,204 --> 01:36:33,147
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't honestly believe that parking control officers will be out there at 7 a.m.

1175
01:36:33,327 --> 01:36:38,730
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know that they plan on staggering hours so that they can cover the entire city.

1176
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:43,994
[SPEAKER_16]: One of my concerns, I'd like to see the time be changed to 8, at least 8 to 6 or something.

1177
01:36:44,534 --> 01:36:49,197
[SPEAKER_16]: But that 7 to 7, people are very concerned about the early morning people who are out.

1178
01:36:49,997 --> 01:36:53,340
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's been a huge concern of mine with the 7 to 7.

1179
01:36:55,995 --> 01:36:57,496
[SPEAKER_16]: I say, I, you know, I'm around everywhere.

1180
01:36:57,816 --> 01:36:59,297
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see any city that has seven o'clock.

1181
01:37:00,097 --> 01:37:02,319
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you know, eight, nine in Boston.

1182
01:37:02,799 --> 01:37:17,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, chief, another thing is, um, and I don't know if this is a question for you, but you know, we're, we're in the winter now and when the plows are coming out and the plowing, I mean, you know, we've all, we've all lived in this community.

1183
01:37:18,588 --> 01:37:23,291
[SPEAKER_16]: The snow mounds pile up to be three or four feet high and you know, and they're not,

1184
01:37:23,775 --> 01:37:26,878
[SPEAKER_16]: and all the sidewalks aren't shoveled in the business areas.

1185
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:33,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's going to shovel these kiosks over these people to get over that?

1186
01:37:33,985 --> 01:37:36,148
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that's yours or the question for these gentlemen.

1187
01:37:36,168 --> 01:37:37,429
[SPEAKER_21]: There will be a combined effort.

1188
01:37:37,549 --> 01:37:39,451
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd turn it over to the gentleman from Republic.

1189
01:37:39,511 --> 01:37:44,016
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's a combined effort between the Department of Public Works and Republic.

1190
01:37:44,056 --> 01:37:46,238
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just know that during a snowstorm,

1191
01:37:46,999 --> 01:37:48,480
[SPEAKER_21]: there'll be no enforcement of those.

1192
01:37:50,362 --> 01:37:52,924
[SPEAKER_16]: It's after the snow and you had several feet.

1193
01:37:53,004 --> 01:37:59,689
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you know, I mean, I, I mean, you see people, you know, the store owners cut a hole this big for, you know, maybe, you know, a little walkway.

1194
01:38:00,309 --> 01:38:09,016
[SPEAKER_16]: So I mean, either, either the city is going to have to clean up the sidewalks because you can't expect people to have to climb over three feet of snow to put money in.

1195
01:38:10,578 --> 01:38:12,459
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, can the gentleman answer that?

1196
01:38:12,499 --> 01:38:13,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe, maybe he can answer that question.

1197
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:21,853
[SPEAKER_27]: Addressing the snow issue, if there is... Could you please state your name and address for the record, please, sir?

1198
01:38:21,873 --> 01:38:22,113
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.

1199
01:38:22,433 --> 01:38:24,674
[SPEAKER_27]: Jack Skelton, Republic Parking System.

1200
01:38:24,714 --> 01:38:26,095
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm a vice president with the company.

1201
01:38:27,256 --> 01:38:28,336
[SPEAKER_27]: I thank you for coming out here tonight.

1202
01:38:28,496 --> 01:38:29,177
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm glad to be here.

1203
01:38:29,817 --> 01:38:34,600
[SPEAKER_27]: In a snow situation, if the kiosks are unreachable because of snow, there will be no enforcement.

1204
01:38:35,008 --> 01:38:38,770
[SPEAKER_27]: but the plan is to have them dug out as quickly as possible after a storm.

1205
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:41,691
[SPEAKER_27]: We deal with this in many cities across the Northeast.

1206
01:38:41,771 --> 01:38:42,512
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, who does it dig out?

1207
01:38:42,552 --> 01:38:43,332
[SPEAKER_16]: You or us?

1208
01:38:43,652 --> 01:38:44,953
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be working with public works.

1209
01:38:45,173 --> 01:38:45,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1210
01:38:45,954 --> 01:38:56,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, another question, which is everyone's asking about is there's multiple stories about handicapped parking going all of the city, how long you can stay where you can stay, where you can't stay.

1211
01:38:56,259 --> 01:38:59,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, can you explain the handicap issue?

1212
01:38:59,340 --> 01:38:59,560
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1213
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:04,503
[SPEAKER_16]: By state statute, handicapped parking is not to be charged for on the street at all.

1214
01:39:05,201 --> 01:39:12,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, if I understand this right, because some of my family has a handicapper, you can put as long as they're parked in a legal spot, correct?

1215
01:39:12,868 --> 01:39:13,268
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.

1216
01:39:13,349 --> 01:39:16,872
[SPEAKER_27]: They cannot block a driveway or a fire hydrant or something like that.

1217
01:39:17,232 --> 01:39:21,476
[SPEAKER_27]: But as long as they have their placard properly displayed, they will not be issued a citation.

1218
01:39:22,277 --> 01:39:28,520
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, if they forget their placard and they're happy to be issued a citation, they can come into the office and we'll take care of it with proof of the placard.

1219
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:28,881
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1220
01:39:29,701 --> 01:39:37,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they subject to the same two hour constraints or one hour, whatever they have to be, or can, can I, can my wife park there all day?

1221
01:39:39,146 --> 01:39:43,728
[SPEAKER_16]: The, they're expected to maintain the two hour time limit, just like every other citizen would say.

1222
01:39:43,769 --> 01:39:50,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Now there's some, there's a lot of confusion going around about some people think is that they have a handicap pocket that they're going to be able to park there all day.

1223
01:39:51,466 --> 01:39:54,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Those ordinance that part of the ordinance has not been changed.

1224
01:39:54,428 --> 01:39:54,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1225
01:39:54,709 --> 01:39:59,272
[SPEAKER_16]: So, so they can only park for whatever the two hours or one hour or whatever.

1226
01:39:59,633 --> 01:40:00,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that chief?

1227
01:40:00,614 --> 01:40:01,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

1228
01:40:01,194 --> 01:40:08,160
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that what we're going to bring the same information that you had counselor?

1229
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,823
[SPEAKER_21]: It was my understanding that they would not, they could pack all day.

1230
01:40:12,784 --> 01:40:14,845
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not held to the same time limit requirement.

1231
01:40:14,985 --> 01:40:16,266
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just my understanding.

1232
01:40:16,286 --> 01:40:18,108
[SPEAKER_21]: And they could pack in any legal packing spot.

1233
01:40:19,059 --> 01:40:20,680
[SPEAKER_21]: So they can park all day or they can't park all day?

1234
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,741
[SPEAKER_21]: That has to be determined.

1235
01:40:24,162 --> 01:40:33,626
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to look up the law and talk with the folks at the Registry of Motor Vehicles that issue the placards.

1236
01:40:33,706 --> 01:40:41,530
[SPEAKER_16]: I think part of the problem is there's a lot of misinformation going around, especially on that issue.

1237
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,491
[SPEAKER_16]: What about the loading zone issue?

1238
01:40:45,317 --> 01:40:45,977
[SPEAKER_16]: The loading zone?

1239
01:40:46,137 --> 01:40:49,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I'm getting a lot of businesses asking about the loading zone areas.

1240
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:57,382
[SPEAKER_16]: How long can I park my, I own a store in the square and I park in the loading zone.

1241
01:40:57,722 --> 01:40:59,963
[SPEAKER_16]: How long am I allowed to stay in that loading zone?

1242
01:40:59,983 --> 01:41:02,083
[SPEAKER_21]: There are no real loading zones in Medford Square.

1243
01:41:02,263 --> 01:41:03,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, not in the square, but other.

1244
01:41:03,124 --> 01:41:04,244
[SPEAKER_21]: No designated loading zones.

1245
01:41:04,284 --> 01:41:05,745
[SPEAKER_21]: The loading zone in West Medford Square.

1246
01:41:05,765 --> 01:41:07,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, there's one in West Medford.

1247
01:41:07,766 --> 01:41:13,788
[SPEAKER_21]: It was not posted properly to start with, but it was a commercial vehicle is 15 minutes

1248
01:41:14,773 --> 01:41:17,954
[SPEAKER_21]: And passenger vehicle was five minutes, so they could run in and run out.

1249
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:22,036
[SPEAKER_21]: There's not a loading zone that's supposed to be an all-day parking.

1250
01:41:22,056 --> 01:41:23,137
[SPEAKER_16]: In Westlake, there is a loading zone.

1251
01:41:23,157 --> 01:41:24,057
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a sign that says loading zone.

1252
01:41:24,077 --> 01:41:25,197
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's not supposed to be all-day parking.

1253
01:41:25,217 --> 01:41:25,798
[SPEAKER_21]: What I'm saying is.

1254
01:41:25,878 --> 01:41:27,038
[SPEAKER_16]: So the loading zone.

1255
01:41:27,598 --> 01:41:28,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Drop off.

1256
01:41:28,199 --> 01:41:28,959
[SPEAKER_16]: 15 minutes.

1257
01:41:28,999 --> 01:41:30,299
[SPEAKER_21]: You didn't get out.

1258
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:32,460
[SPEAKER_21]: 15 minutes for commercial, five minutes for passenger.

1259
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,602
[SPEAKER_16]: 15 minutes for commercial, and five minutes for.

1260
01:41:35,922 --> 01:41:39,963
[SPEAKER_21]: And the same thing will be taking place at the hillside at Boston and Winthrop.

1261
01:41:40,164 --> 01:41:40,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information.

1262
01:41:41,328 --> 01:41:42,728
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, counselor.

1263
01:41:42,748 --> 01:41:50,091
[SPEAKER_14]: You're telling me in that loading zone up on the hillside, somebody goes in there, they're going to have, and they want to get some paint and they have to stir the paint and shake it up.

1264
01:41:50,111 --> 01:41:51,151
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to be out in five minutes.

1265
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:52,011
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to get a ticket.

1266
01:41:53,052 --> 01:41:53,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Five minutes.

1267
01:41:53,472 --> 01:41:55,232
[SPEAKER_21]: You just said we have to be reasonable.

1268
01:41:55,272 --> 01:41:57,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's the whole thing about being reasonable here.

1269
01:41:57,813 --> 01:42:01,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are we discussing all this?

1270
01:42:01,354 --> 01:42:03,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, a loading zone.

1271
01:42:03,755 --> 01:42:09,777
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding is for doing deliveries to the company or the company doing a quick pickup and heading out.

1272
01:42:09,977 --> 01:42:10,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1273
01:42:10,492 --> 01:42:11,812
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not for customers, it's a loading zone.

1274
01:42:11,852 --> 01:42:16,773
[SPEAKER_11]: But the nature of a certain business, if it's one of those... No, but he's talking about getting paint shaken up.

1275
01:42:16,793 --> 01:42:19,053
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a customer going in and getting paint shaken up.

1276
01:42:19,214 --> 01:42:19,934
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a loading zone.

1277
01:42:20,054 --> 01:42:23,554
[SPEAKER_14]: He just said for commercial and residential purposes.

1278
01:42:23,634 --> 01:42:28,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I challenge you to go up there and buy some paint and see if you get a ticket when you come out, because that's not the purpose of a loading zone.

1279
01:42:29,835 --> 01:42:30,235
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1280
01:42:30,435 --> 01:42:31,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Points both well received.

1281
01:42:31,976 --> 01:42:33,956
[SPEAKER_16]: The floor goes back to Councillor Kerrio.

1282
01:42:36,256 --> 01:42:39,277
[SPEAKER_16]: All these municipal lots, again, misinformation.

1283
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:47,886
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hearing that the lot in Medford Square behind on Governor's Ave is now business only.

1284
01:42:48,086 --> 01:42:50,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely not, absolutely not.

1285
01:42:50,067 --> 01:42:50,728
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that gonna be?

1286
01:42:51,228 --> 01:42:56,513
[SPEAKER_21]: The restriction that's there today is the restriction that was there last year and the year before.

1287
01:42:56,893 --> 01:43:01,417
[SPEAKER_21]: Business parking along the wall that goes up against 15 Governor's Ave.

1288
01:43:01,797 --> 01:43:08,863
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been told by people in the square that, you know, your people are telling them, don't worry, park your car in the lot there.

1289
01:43:09,413 --> 01:43:09,974
[SPEAKER_16]: for businesses?

1290
01:43:10,474 --> 01:43:13,417
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyone we've spoken to in the square, any of the businesses in the square.

1291
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,457
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all I was told yesterday, Chief.

1292
01:43:14,638 --> 01:43:17,560
[SPEAKER_21]: The business parking is along that wall, that back wall.

1293
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:24,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Everything in the middle and anything that's parallel to the Colleen's down to Gaffey's is not business parking.

1294
01:43:24,766 --> 01:43:25,367
[SPEAKER_21]: Business permit.

1295
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:27,409
[SPEAKER_21]: They'll be held to the time limits that are posted.

1296
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:30,752
[SPEAKER_24]: Additional point of further clarification.

1297
01:43:30,772 --> 01:43:32,753
[SPEAKER_14]: You have three different time limits in that parking lot.

1298
01:43:32,793 --> 01:43:33,994
[SPEAKER_14]: How come there's no kiosks in there?

1299
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:37,632
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a kind of limit against the wall on the back of Salvatore's.

1300
01:43:37,852 --> 01:43:40,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you have one for the business people on that wall.

1301
01:43:40,254 --> 01:43:41,655
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the middle, you have two hour parking.

1302
01:43:41,895 --> 01:43:44,657
[SPEAKER_14]: You have one hour, you have two hour, and the back of the wall parking.

1303
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:47,159
[SPEAKER_14]: There's three different parking types in that parking lot.

1304
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:49,641
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, what's your question?

1305
01:43:50,662 --> 01:43:52,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Why isn't there just something that's consistent?

1306
01:43:53,389 --> 01:43:54,630
[SPEAKER_14]: The clarification, what is it?

1307
01:43:54,810 --> 01:44:01,174
[SPEAKER_14]: How can you have one hour, somebody, because they parked their car parallel, somebody parking it horizontal?

1308
01:44:01,194 --> 01:44:01,614
[SPEAKER_14]: What difference?

1309
01:44:01,754 --> 01:44:08,018
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we're trying to accommodate, we've been trying to accommodate the businesses in Medford before this parking plan was even in place.

1310
01:44:08,398 --> 01:44:09,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Those signs aren't anything new.

1311
01:44:09,779 --> 01:44:11,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Those are the signs that were there.

1312
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:17,032
[SPEAKER_21]: And we wanted to have people be able to go into Colleen's, or go into the sub shop.

1313
01:44:17,112 --> 01:44:18,933
[SPEAKER_15]: You've made your point, Councilor Pinter.

1314
01:44:19,013 --> 01:44:21,474
[SPEAKER_15]: No, there's a corollary point to that.

1315
01:44:21,494 --> 01:44:22,934
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a corollary point to that.

1316
01:44:23,154 --> 01:44:24,255
[SPEAKER_14]: You go up Governor's Avenue.

1317
01:44:24,455 --> 01:44:27,076
[SPEAKER_14]: How come if you go up Governor's Avenue, you've done nothing with that?

1318
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:30,457
[SPEAKER_14]: It's two hours on the right going up, and one hour coming back on the left.

1319
01:44:30,477 --> 01:44:32,598
[SPEAKER_24]: You have a chance to have the floor, Councilor.

1320
01:44:33,018 --> 01:44:33,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caviello?

1321
01:44:34,258 --> 01:44:35,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President, again.

1322
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:38,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Back to the municipal lots.

1323
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,861
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so Meffitt Square is just going to be the same as

1324
01:44:41,452 --> 01:44:43,933
[SPEAKER_16]: The back lot, the back row, is this going to be the way it's been?

1325
01:44:45,114 --> 01:44:45,414
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct?

1326
01:44:45,954 --> 01:44:49,776
[SPEAKER_21]: As it was posted in the past, it's remaining the same.

1327
01:44:50,516 --> 01:44:58,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, as I look out here in the back lot here, I only see one kiosk way up here on the side of the building for that whole lot.

1328
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,161
[SPEAKER_16]: Shouldn't it be more than one kiosk?

1329
01:45:00,201 --> 01:45:03,662
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe there is a second one, and I think they're just repositioning where the second one is.

1330
01:45:03,682 --> 01:45:04,122
[SPEAKER_16]: Repositioning.

1331
01:45:04,243 --> 01:45:07,304
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, what about, are you putting one in the Yale Street lot?

1332
01:45:08,371 --> 01:45:09,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that one is due.

1333
01:45:10,053 --> 01:45:13,176
[SPEAKER_21]: They, because of the weather today, they weren't able to do the pad.

1334
01:45:13,236 --> 01:45:16,720
[SPEAKER_21]: They have to pour a cement pad because it's an asphalt surface.

1335
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,041
[SPEAKER_21]: So they have to do concrete.

1336
01:45:18,322 --> 01:45:26,310
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm receiving calls from other people about, uh, some people in the Haines square area park in that lot in the back at night.

1337
01:45:27,211 --> 01:45:29,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they going to have to have their car out there in the morning?

1338
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:32,391
[SPEAKER_16]: by a certain time in the morning for people to park there, right?

1339
01:45:32,511 --> 01:45:33,051
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I mean.

1340
01:45:33,071 --> 01:45:34,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the parking's limited over in that area, as it is.

1341
01:45:35,132 --> 01:45:38,913
[SPEAKER_21]: The neighborhood, they would have to have the car out to accommodate the business people.

1342
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:45,375
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the benefit is that they have an opportunity to park off street overnight.

1343
01:45:45,815 --> 01:45:48,336
[SPEAKER_21]: And then in the morning, the car has to be removed.

1344
01:45:49,237 --> 01:45:49,317
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

1345
01:45:49,357 --> 01:45:50,137
[SPEAKER_21]: And my last question.

1346
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:55,999
[SPEAKER_16]: The resident permit parking, these gentlemen are going to be enforcing that also?

1347
01:45:56,499 --> 01:45:56,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, they are.

1348
01:45:57,259 --> 01:45:59,000
[SPEAKER_21]: But the police will also be doing that.

1349
01:45:59,550 --> 01:46:01,171
[SPEAKER_21]: For the most part, during the daylight hours.

1350
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:02,871
[SPEAKER_21]: No, what about at nighttime?

1351
01:46:02,891 --> 01:46:03,912
[SPEAKER_21]: Public parking will be doing it.

1352
01:46:03,932 --> 01:46:13,896
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're also been informed that they're willing to stagger the shifts of their personnel so that you'll have some evening coverage and possibly even into the early morning hours.

1353
01:46:14,956 --> 01:46:21,899
[SPEAKER_21]: They will stagger the shift, but they, they are willing to do that to make sure that we get citywide enforcement.

1354
01:46:22,839 --> 01:46:23,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1355
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:29,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Chief, you know, if at your convenience, when you get the ruling on the handicap issue, um,

1356
01:46:29,449 --> 01:46:36,554
[SPEAKER_16]: That is a key, because again, a lot of people are questioning that on who can park, who can't park.

1357
01:46:36,674 --> 01:46:40,236
[SPEAKER_21]: As I stated, I don't want to contradict Mr. Skelton.

1358
01:46:41,057 --> 01:46:52,945
[SPEAKER_21]: The last I heard was that a person who has the proper HP placard or plate could park in any space and are not held to the time limit.

1359
01:46:53,866 --> 01:46:56,287
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to verify that to be accurate.

1360
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:02,862
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's one of the biggest issues that need to be clarified.

1361
01:47:03,943 --> 01:47:09,405
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of people are under the impression that they get a placket, I'm there for the day, and you can't.

1362
01:47:09,645 --> 01:47:10,926
[SPEAKER_16]: I will get that answer tomorrow.

1363
01:47:13,067 --> 01:47:13,687
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it for the moment.

1364
01:47:13,767 --> 01:47:15,008
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure we'll have some more for you.

1365
01:47:15,605 --> 01:47:25,847
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, and before we turn the floor over to Councilor Langel-Kern, if you'll indulge me, two quick questions from the chair which have been brought to my attention regarding these regulations.

1366
01:47:26,527 --> 01:47:28,408
[SPEAKER_24]: Stacy's going to the hairdresser.

1367
01:47:29,128 --> 01:47:43,571
[SPEAKER_24]: She fills up the meter for two hours parking, halfway in between getting her hair set and dyed and whatever else she's doing, two hours run out, she's there in the chair under the hairdresser dryer with the apron on, what is she gonna do?

1368
01:47:44,498 --> 01:47:45,178
[SPEAKER_24]: Is she going to pay?

1369
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:47,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Is she going to feed her meter?

1370
01:47:47,939 --> 01:47:49,220
[SPEAKER_27]: What happens to Stacey?

1371
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:51,781
[SPEAKER_27]: I will address that issue.

1372
01:47:51,861 --> 01:48:06,046
[SPEAKER_27]: But as an overview, part of Republic Parking's job here for the city and what we promised them is that we will work to accommodate as many scenarios as we can to facilitate good business practices and turnover spaces in the city.

1373
01:48:06,766 --> 01:48:08,167
[SPEAKER_27]: And we are already seeing that.

1374
01:48:08,287 --> 01:48:14,029
[SPEAKER_27]: We've seen streets empty out from employees when we park our enforcement vehicle there just to go in and have lunch.

1375
01:48:14,685 --> 01:48:17,027
[SPEAKER_27]: So we are seeing the preliminary effects of the program.

1376
01:48:17,707 --> 01:48:23,752
[SPEAKER_27]: And we are dealing with specific issues such as the hairdresser scenario that has been brought to the administration's attention.

1377
01:48:24,352 --> 01:48:30,357
[SPEAKER_27]: We are working on a validation program that will allow them to exceed the two-hour time limit without being cited.

1378
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:31,619
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1379
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:44,808
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, in one more, even though I was just, uh, pointed out to me by one of my colleagues that I'm speaking from the chair, which I ought not do, uh, you pay a dollar 75 to park in South Medford.

1380
01:48:45,169 --> 01:48:46,870
[SPEAKER_24]: You stay there for 45 minutes.

1381
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:48,471
[SPEAKER_24]: You got a half hour left.

1382
01:48:49,152 --> 01:48:55,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Can you go to Medford square and run to the bank on the same, same dollar 75 or do you have to repay at the next kiosk?

1383
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:58,298
[SPEAKER_27]: No, you're actually paying for your plate.

1384
01:48:59,069 --> 01:49:05,274
[SPEAKER_27]: And so your plate is in the system for the amount of time you purchase, and it will not be cited if you park on the street anywhere in the city.

1385
01:49:05,614 --> 01:49:06,394
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much.

1386
01:49:07,355 --> 01:49:09,877
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, councilor Lungo Kern has the chair, uh, floor.

1387
01:49:10,578 --> 01:49:12,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, president.

1388
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:13,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, Delaware.

1389
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:23,387
[SPEAKER_18]: So on that last point with regards to if somebody is in the hairdresser salon, isn't it true that some spots are a maximum limit?

1390
01:49:23,703 --> 01:49:31,026
[SPEAKER_18]: where you can only have the two hours, but then there's other spots that you could, you could refeed the meter, whether that's through your cell phone or by adding more money into the meter.

1391
01:49:32,046 --> 01:49:36,328
[SPEAKER_27]: The payment of the meter is irrelevant of the time limit.

1392
01:49:36,708 --> 01:49:38,609
[SPEAKER_27]: The time limit is what it is.

1393
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:43,471
[SPEAKER_27]: So when you go to a kiosk, you can only pay for a maximum of two hours.

1394
01:49:44,131 --> 01:49:52,415
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you were to not move your vehicle, but add additional monies to the meter, you would still be in violation of the two hour time limit ordinance.

1395
01:49:53,353 --> 01:50:05,343
[SPEAKER_27]: So that prevents what they call meter feeding and defeats the purpose of the program to facilitate turnover of spaces to free up time, move the employees out, and allow more customers to come in.

1396
01:50:07,585 --> 01:50:12,148
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that we were told incorrect information then at committee of the whole meetings.

1397
01:50:12,328 --> 01:50:17,052
[SPEAKER_18]: We were told that certain spots would not be limited and you could add more money.

1398
01:50:17,953 --> 01:50:18,854
[SPEAKER_18]: We were definitely told that.

1399
01:50:19,134 --> 01:50:20,835
[SPEAKER_18]: We've asked that more than once.

1400
01:50:20,875 --> 01:50:22,697
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe we can get a clarification on that.

1401
01:50:23,238 --> 01:50:37,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Chief, I don't think Chief Sacco was at, I think we had three city council committee of the whole meetings when we were told some meters could be refed if somebody was in a restaurant and they were exceeding the two hours, it could be refed through your cell phone.

1402
01:50:39,011 --> 01:50:42,974
[SPEAKER_18]: There were some that were gonna be the max, but then there were others that, am I recalling that correct?

1403
01:50:42,994 --> 01:50:48,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you were to put an hour, you would be defeated.

1404
01:50:48,078 --> 01:50:48,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, for two hours?

1405
01:50:48,859 --> 01:50:50,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Up to the two hours, but that's my understanding.

1406
01:50:51,535 --> 01:51:02,042
[SPEAKER_18]: My other question, so Chief, for the senior center, when will we know how many spaces will be free and where those will be placed?

1407
01:51:02,263 --> 01:51:06,286
[SPEAKER_18]: When is the goal timeframe for that scenario?

1408
01:51:06,346 --> 01:51:14,892
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm hoping by the end of the week we'll have the concrete answers and we'll just have to look and identify where the best spaces are to accommodate the center.

1409
01:51:15,372 --> 01:51:17,894
[SPEAKER_18]: And those spaces will be clearly marked?

1410
01:51:18,555 --> 01:51:18,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1411
01:51:19,518 --> 01:51:27,441
[SPEAKER_18]: And then one other question you had mentioned, and I got an email on it today, with regards to people dropping off their children at St.

1412
01:51:27,461 --> 01:51:28,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Joseph's School.

1413
01:51:29,522 --> 01:51:31,123
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if this is going to be an issue at St.

1414
01:51:31,163 --> 01:51:31,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Ray's.

1415
01:51:31,383 --> 01:51:33,404
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure how much parking is at each school.

1416
01:51:33,764 --> 01:51:35,064
[SPEAKER_18]: But specifically, St.

1417
01:51:35,104 --> 01:51:38,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Joe's parent wants to run in, drop off their child, and run back out.

1418
01:51:39,266 --> 01:51:42,067
[SPEAKER_18]: How do they know they don't have to feed the meter at that point?

1419
01:51:42,422 --> 01:51:52,690
[SPEAKER_21]: I think in all of those examples, a school drop-off, a daycare drop-off, a school pick-up and a daycare pick-up, we know people aren't hanging around for long periods.

1420
01:51:53,871 --> 01:51:55,872
[SPEAKER_21]: There'll be consideration given during those times.

1421
01:51:56,213 --> 01:51:58,755
[SPEAKER_18]: How will Republic know where the daycare is a place?

1422
01:51:59,135 --> 01:52:00,336
[SPEAKER_18]: Which schools need this?

1423
01:52:01,217 --> 01:52:06,881
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we've already kind of identified those locations, and I'm open to hearing more.

1424
01:52:06,901 --> 01:52:09,363
[SPEAKER_21]: It may pop up along the way, but I've already, you know,

1425
01:52:10,071 --> 01:52:14,675
[SPEAKER_21]: pretty much heard the list of all of the concerns for those types of, uh, operations.

1426
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:16,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1427
01:52:16,276 --> 01:52:16,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1428
01:52:16,677 --> 01:52:17,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, just if I could.

1429
01:52:18,338 --> 01:52:18,899
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1430
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:21,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, council longer current, you're finished.

1431
01:52:21,181 --> 01:52:22,962
[SPEAKER_24]: A council night was next council.

1432
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:26,065
[SPEAKER_24]: Max, do you have a, uh, point?

1433
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:28,807
[SPEAKER_24]: And we also have many citizens who have yet to address us.

1434
01:52:29,068 --> 01:52:30,589
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think you're eager to speak.

1435
01:52:30,629 --> 01:52:32,751
[SPEAKER_26]: You echo my sentiment, uh, Mr. President.

1436
01:52:33,091 --> 01:52:37,055
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, I think we have a number of people here that are lining up in queue that have questions that they want answered.

1437
01:52:37,195 --> 01:52:37,295
[SPEAKER_26]: Um,

1438
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:42,570
[SPEAKER_26]: some of which are business owners that probably have to get up very early tomorrow morning to be sure that operations are up and running.

1439
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:54,416
[SPEAKER_26]: With that being said, you made a suggestion at the beginning of the meeting that we might want to reserve our questions for the end, allow the folks from Republic and the Traffic Commission to get an understanding of what the questions are that are coming to them so they can answer those questions.

1440
01:52:55,037 --> 01:53:04,181
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we're in a position to have the good fortune of being able to reach out to these folks and get return calls and speak with them much more frequently and much more easily than the people that are here in the audience.

1441
01:53:04,221 --> 01:53:07,143
[SPEAKER_26]: And they've been waiting patiently, Mr. President, so I'd ask that maybe we can

1442
01:53:08,043 --> 01:53:14,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, just if I could ask one question, because it's online that was just mentioned by Mr. Skelton.

1443
01:53:14,964 --> 01:53:21,705
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realize these people have been waiting, but while Mr. Skelton is here, it's an important question.

1444
01:53:21,845 --> 01:53:23,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would agree the people should speak.

1445
01:53:25,746 --> 01:53:27,826
[SPEAKER_09]: You just mentioned about a validation program.

1446
01:53:28,987 --> 01:53:32,247
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a brand new aspect to this program I've never heard of before.

1447
01:53:33,127 --> 01:53:37,288
[SPEAKER_09]: And the way it was explained to me is what was just mentioned by the Council President.

1448
01:53:37,635 --> 01:53:47,379
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to allow business owners to reach out to Republic and say, these five plate numbers on Tuesday are going to be here for an extended period of time.

1449
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:49,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't tag them.

1450
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:51,461
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have to pay.

1451
01:53:51,681 --> 01:53:52,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone's going to pay.

1452
01:53:52,281 --> 01:53:55,462
[SPEAKER_09]: The business is going to pay, whatever it is, for that period of time.

1453
01:53:55,743 --> 01:53:56,463
[SPEAKER_09]: But don't tag them.

1454
01:53:57,083 --> 01:54:02,966
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have any business that reaches out to you under this current program, I own a convenience store.

1455
01:54:03,286 --> 01:54:06,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And I tell you, there are going to be these three plates parked

1456
01:54:06,849 --> 01:54:09,831
[SPEAKER_09]: extended period of time near my business.

1457
01:54:11,411 --> 01:54:18,715
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to allow them to stay three, four, five, six, seven hours in that spot without getting a ticket.

1458
01:54:18,735 --> 01:54:24,218
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to pay, but as long as they get the validation, is that, is that how this program works?

1459
01:54:25,519 --> 01:54:29,221
[SPEAKER_27]: We are charged with enforcing the ordinance and the rules of the city.

1460
01:54:29,961 --> 01:54:33,623
[SPEAKER_27]: So whatever the city adopts as the rules for parking is what we will enforce.

1461
01:54:34,369 --> 01:54:42,656
[SPEAKER_27]: The ability to offer the validations for extending the two hour time limit, which is currently the ordinance, is there through a validation program.

1462
01:54:43,296 --> 01:54:44,697
[SPEAKER_27]: And there's a number of ways to do that.

1463
01:54:45,017 --> 01:54:55,966
[SPEAKER_27]: One can be through an online reservation system, or it can be as simply if it's someone that only validates once a month or very infrequently, they can simply call our office and make an arrangement.

1464
01:54:56,779 --> 01:55:01,383
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the discussion at this point as to who it applies to and how it applies.

1465
01:55:01,924 --> 01:55:04,406
[SPEAKER_27]: That's up to the, uh, the city to decide.

1466
01:55:04,526 --> 01:55:06,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So that hasn't been worked out yet.

1467
01:55:06,188 --> 01:55:07,229
[SPEAKER_27]: Not all the details, sir.

1468
01:55:07,289 --> 01:55:07,409
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

1469
01:55:07,829 --> 01:55:13,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're moving forward in a couple of weeks and it seems like a lot of details haven't been worked out yet.

1470
01:55:14,015 --> 01:55:22,783
[SPEAKER_09]: My concern with that is that if, you know, it might be good for one or two people in the course of a day, but if you have 45 people reserving spots on our streets,

1471
01:55:23,417 --> 01:55:29,440
[SPEAKER_09]: As you just mentioned, the refeeding of a meter defeats the purpose of the whole program of moving cars along.

1472
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:33,122
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can sympathize if someone needs to be in a business for over two hours.

1473
01:55:33,583 --> 01:55:36,124
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I'm not sure how you're going to manage that.

1474
01:55:36,784 --> 01:55:46,910
[SPEAKER_09]: And to have this program, the validation program, just brought up at the last minute, I don't think is a good program, especially where there's no consistency.

1475
01:55:47,210 --> 01:55:49,451
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no policy from what you're telling me.

1476
01:55:50,151 --> 01:55:51,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I doubt the city has a policy on that.

1477
01:55:53,417 --> 01:55:56,939
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not sure if that's something that should be implemented right away.

1478
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:05,725
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know the mayor is trying to appease anyone that makes a phone call to him, but I'm not quite sure that's in the best interest of our city as a whole.

1479
01:56:06,285 --> 01:56:14,350
[SPEAKER_09]: And it may not be a question to you, but I'm very concerned about that program because potentially anyone can give you seven plates.

1480
01:56:15,331 --> 01:56:20,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Any business owner can call and give you seven plate numbers and say, please don't touch these Tuesday.

1481
01:56:21,123 --> 01:56:23,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't see what would prevent that.

1482
01:56:23,886 --> 01:56:26,188
[SPEAKER_09]: And before you know it, there's going to be no on-street parking.

1483
01:56:27,349 --> 01:56:28,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's going to be saved.

1484
01:56:29,451 --> 01:56:31,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, when you boil down to it.

1485
01:56:31,573 --> 01:56:36,478
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would be worthwhile to pay $0.25 for every 15 minutes.

1486
01:56:37,059 --> 01:56:37,900
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be a bargain.

1487
01:56:38,781 --> 01:56:40,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, you may even get people that

1488
01:56:40,493 --> 01:56:46,255
[SPEAKER_09]: park there all day, and take the bus into town for $4 or $5, whatever it costs.

1489
01:56:46,575 --> 01:56:47,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, really.

1490
01:56:47,315 --> 01:56:53,617
[SPEAKER_09]: And I might be stating it very simply, but there's a huge concern with that.

1491
01:56:54,037 --> 01:57:00,740
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that was a knee-jerk reaction by this administration to try to help out a few people, all in good faith.

1492
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,260
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know how that's going to work.

1493
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,041
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would recommend that that doesn't move forward.

1494
01:57:07,418 --> 01:57:08,859
[SPEAKER_20]: If I may, my name is Dan Nash.

1495
01:57:08,879 --> 01:57:10,640
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm the regional manager for Republic Parking.

1496
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:14,742
[SPEAKER_20]: When we discussed this validation program, it was to allow an additional hour.

1497
01:57:15,302 --> 01:57:19,744
[SPEAKER_20]: So it would only be up, they could purchase up to a third hour, not unlimited for the entire day.

1498
01:57:20,624 --> 01:57:24,286
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the city, that's the city policy now.

1499
01:57:24,686 --> 01:57:31,410
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not the city policy now, but that's, what's been discussed with the administration to try to accommodate, you know, the example that was provided by the president earlier.

1500
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:36,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And so was raising the fee to $400 discussed and that was raised.

1501
01:57:37,177 --> 01:57:40,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's a lot of discussion going on and no one knows what's happening.

1502
01:57:41,821 --> 01:57:42,642
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the problem.

1503
01:57:43,022 --> 01:57:43,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is.

1504
01:57:43,503 --> 01:57:46,626
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not blaming you too, but there's a lot going on.

1505
01:57:46,666 --> 01:57:50,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And these are the reasons why we should have had 10 public hearings prior to this.

1506
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:53,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And from what we see, you're right.

1507
01:57:53,452 --> 01:57:59,317
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always going to be work in progress, but this is only about 40% in completion, in my opinion, chief, at this point.

1508
01:58:00,121 --> 01:58:04,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know how we have a go-live date, which doesn't make any sense.

1509
01:58:05,203 --> 01:58:06,584
[SPEAKER_21]: All I can ask is for your patience.

1510
01:58:06,964 --> 01:58:11,766
[SPEAKER_21]: I think a lot of the bugs have already been worked out, but every day we're going to find something new that we're going to have to work on.

1511
01:58:11,786 --> 01:58:13,506
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the residents' patience, not my patience.

1512
01:58:15,287 --> 01:58:22,390
[SPEAKER_21]: Part of the problem that we have when we first started talking about that validation program was a lot of the postings in the city on the main drags

1513
01:58:23,498 --> 01:58:24,518
[SPEAKER_21]: were one hour only.

1514
01:58:25,338 --> 01:58:31,199
[SPEAKER_21]: All of those one hours were increased to two to accommodate some of the businesses, the hairdressers and things of that nature.

1515
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:51,763
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I think it was already addressed on maybe going up to a third hour for those accommodations, but no way would someone be able to be there or make arrangements with anyone that they could be in that spot all day, unless they were parking in a spot that has all day parking, where you could pay $5 and park there for the day.

1516
01:58:53,839 --> 01:58:56,680
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be the only exception, because it has to be consistent.

1517
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:57,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is that policy?

1518
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is that written, Chief?

1519
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is that written?

1520
01:59:01,681 --> 01:59:04,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It must be a policy, a guideline.

1521
01:59:04,361 --> 01:59:07,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is that written, the validation policy?

1522
01:59:09,382 --> 01:59:10,623
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have that.

1523
01:59:10,663 --> 01:59:11,203
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I mean.

1524
01:59:11,443 --> 01:59:12,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is this stuff?

1525
01:59:12,383 --> 01:59:17,004
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as the validation, I think that's between the merchant and the customer.

1526
01:59:17,024 --> 01:59:21,765
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but Chief, God forbid something happens to you tomorrow, who's going to have this information in their head?

1527
01:59:23,268 --> 01:59:25,388
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the sign is what it says.

1528
01:59:25,428 --> 01:59:31,109
[SPEAKER_09]: If it says two hour limit, I know, but business owners are walking around now telling people that they can get validation.

1529
01:59:31,409 --> 01:59:33,610
[SPEAKER_09]: And it wasn't an hour that I heard from business owners.

1530
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:36,190
[SPEAKER_09]: So they thought they can get more than an hour, just so you know.

1531
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:41,591
[SPEAKER_21]: And if we don't have anything in writing chief, why would anyone be requesting more than one hour?

1532
01:59:41,631 --> 01:59:46,272
[SPEAKER_21]: If you already have a two hour limit and now you're going to be granted maybe a validation for the third hour.

1533
01:59:46,812 --> 01:59:50,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Why would any business want to grant someone a validation for longer than that?

1534
01:59:50,833 --> 01:59:51,213
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that's,

1535
01:59:52,645 --> 01:59:54,626
[SPEAKER_21]: is counterproductive to trying to generate the business.

1536
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:57,227
[SPEAKER_21]: What if they have an employee they want to park out there for a couple hours?

1537
01:59:58,047 --> 01:59:59,347
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of reasons, Chief.

1538
02:00:00,327 --> 02:00:01,348
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of reasons.

1539
02:00:01,908 --> 02:00:03,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And we should be in the business of saving spots.

1540
02:00:03,809 --> 02:00:08,650
[SPEAKER_21]: As we go along, we'll encounter all of these, and we'll correct the problems that exist.

1541
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:09,450
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a new day.

1542
02:00:09,490 --> 02:00:10,250
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all I can say.

1543
02:00:10,351 --> 02:00:11,211
[SPEAKER_24]: It is a new day.

1544
02:00:11,831 --> 02:00:13,051
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1545
02:00:13,451 --> 02:00:18,093
[SPEAKER_24]: A number of citizens would like to speak, and one is approaching who already has.

1546
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:21,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you know my name, Gwendolyn Blackburn.

1547
02:00:23,172 --> 02:00:46,029
[SPEAKER_02]: What I really wanted to say, I hope that our citizens out there that are listening and watching understand that if they're talking about a committee here, it is not the committee and it's not the report that Councilor Marks, myself, and the other citizens worked on because I'm hearing things that really

1548
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:48,651
[SPEAKER_02]: did not come out of our committee.

1549
02:00:49,552 --> 02:00:58,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm hoping that people understand there was one committee back 2008, 2009, and we gave a report to the mayor.

1550
02:00:58,757 --> 02:01:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: We never heard another thing from the mayor.

1551
02:01:01,278 --> 02:01:01,899
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

1552
02:01:02,379 --> 02:01:03,260
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all done.

1553
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:08,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just hope that people understand that we did our job.

1554
02:01:09,283 --> 02:01:10,924
[SPEAKER_02]: We went around to all these cities.

1555
02:01:11,364 --> 02:01:13,405
[SPEAKER_02]: We got all the information that we could get.

1556
02:01:13,986 --> 02:01:14,846
[SPEAKER_02]: We had our meetings.

1557
02:01:14,886 --> 02:01:15,967
[SPEAKER_02]: We put it all together.

1558
02:01:16,307 --> 02:01:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: and we gave it to the mayor.

1559
02:01:17,908 --> 02:01:19,569
[SPEAKER_02]: We never heard anything else from him.

1560
02:01:20,109 --> 02:01:27,553
[SPEAKER_02]: From that point on, anything else that you're hearing and anything else that's coming up, that's the mayor.

1561
02:01:28,534 --> 02:01:29,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just

1562
02:01:29,925 --> 02:01:41,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need you to know that it wasn't our committee, because we were very diligent about what we did, and we put a lot of time into going around to these different cities and towns.

1563
02:01:42,928 --> 02:01:47,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a question, though, having been standing here.

1564
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:52,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm understanding that people have to know their license plate.

1565
02:01:53,652 --> 02:01:59,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can tell you, two people in my house, they have no idea what their license plate happens to be.

1566
02:01:59,833 --> 02:02:00,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I know mine.

1567
02:02:01,153 --> 02:02:08,635
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a lot of people that they don't know.

1568
02:02:08,975 --> 02:02:10,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't understand.

1569
02:02:12,535 --> 02:02:17,796
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that has happened is that all of this has been put into play.

1570
02:02:19,056 --> 02:02:21,677
[SPEAKER_02]: You get bits and pieces of information, like the lady said.

1571
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:26,387
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't know they have to know their license plate.

1572
02:02:26,407 --> 02:02:28,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many people in here know their license plate.

1573
02:02:29,794 --> 02:02:32,479
[SPEAKER_02]: They may, may not, but a lot of people don't.

1574
02:02:34,125 --> 02:02:37,228
[SPEAKER_02]: The other question, and I'll sit down because this lady wants to speak.

1575
02:02:37,248 --> 02:02:37,929
[SPEAKER_02]: She has to leave.

1576
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:40,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are we doing?

1577
02:02:41,212 --> 02:02:49,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would think that the first thing that might have happened is that we might have gotten meters up by Tufts up on Boston Avenue.

1578
02:02:50,019 --> 02:02:53,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Those kids park up there all day, every day, free of charge.

1579
02:02:54,423 --> 02:03:00,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would think, I was told they have to put concrete to put those kiosks there.

1580
02:03:00,845 --> 02:03:03,585
[SPEAKER_02]: They charge at the garage $8 a day.

1581
02:03:03,705 --> 02:03:13,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm told these, we've been missing a lot of money by not having any kind of meters or anything up there.

1582
02:03:13,128 --> 02:03:14,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the kids, but.

1583
02:03:14,908 --> 02:03:15,749
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I want to say.

1584
02:03:15,829 --> 02:03:16,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else.

1585
02:03:16,830 --> 02:03:17,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1586
02:03:17,250 --> 02:03:18,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information.

1587
02:03:19,052 --> 02:03:19,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1588
02:03:19,352 --> 02:03:22,915
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mrs B, thank you for, for your clarification or the report.

1589
02:03:23,395 --> 02:03:29,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just referring that I said after you guys made the original initial recommendations at that point,

1590
02:03:29,695 --> 02:03:33,016
[SPEAKER_11]: The only person that could do anything was the mayor, because he's the signatory authority.

1591
02:03:33,477 --> 02:03:34,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't sound like it.

1592
02:03:34,597 --> 02:03:36,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were talking about our committee.

1593
02:03:37,038 --> 02:03:38,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted the trustees to know for sure.

1594
02:03:38,979 --> 02:03:40,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not our committee.

1595
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:44,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the committee that you were on, though, did make recommendations for kiosks and meters.

1596
02:03:44,081 --> 02:03:45,542
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want the paper, I'll give it to you.

1597
02:03:46,142 --> 02:03:46,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1598
02:03:46,862 --> 02:03:49,003
[SPEAKER_24]: Ma'am, could you please state your name and address for the record?

1599
02:03:49,284 --> 02:03:54,746
[SPEAKER_33]: My name is Patricia Davenport, and I live in 127 Monument Street, West Medford.

1600
02:03:55,388 --> 02:04:00,551
[SPEAKER_33]: I love West Medford, the uniqueness of it, its small businesses and shops.

1601
02:04:00,571 --> 02:04:02,252
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm just going to mention a few.

1602
02:04:02,312 --> 02:04:03,733
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm in and out of them often.

1603
02:04:04,573 --> 02:04:16,920
[SPEAKER_33]: CB Scoops, Paul Reviews, okay, Dynamic Computer, and I'm just trying to list a few that I use a lot, Magnificent Muffins, and all the restaurants, delis, there are many of them.

1604
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:25,144
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm afraid this is really going to hurt these small businesses, and that would destroy the character

1605
02:04:25,493 --> 02:04:27,975
[SPEAKER_33]: and the environment of West Medford, I think.

1606
02:04:28,335 --> 02:04:30,257
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm talking about West Medford, that's where I live.

1607
02:04:31,117 --> 02:04:34,660
[SPEAKER_33]: The second thing that I'm very concerned about is the process.

1608
02:04:35,841 --> 02:04:38,122
[SPEAKER_33]: The process was not transparent.

1609
02:04:39,083 --> 02:04:50,231
[SPEAKER_33]: There wasn't much or any input from residents or small businesses, which I believe is against the way we're supposed to be as a democracy.

1610
02:04:53,792 --> 02:05:02,097
[SPEAKER_33]: serve along the lines of no taxation without representation, no kiosks without people being informed and discussing it.

1611
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:09,242
[SPEAKER_33]: And the third thing is that the Republic Parking is not a local business.

1612
02:05:09,562 --> 02:05:11,503
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not even a Massachusetts business.

1613
02:05:12,203 --> 02:05:15,085
[SPEAKER_33]: It comes from, I believe, Chattanooga, Tennessee.

1614
02:05:15,686 --> 02:05:22,950
[SPEAKER_33]: So we've outsourced this money-making operation to out-of-state

1615
02:05:23,452 --> 02:05:28,413
[SPEAKER_33]: which makes any recourse incredibly difficult.

1616
02:05:28,593 --> 02:05:33,614
[SPEAKER_33]: Anybody who's tried to deal with a big bank, you get put on hold for your entire day.

1617
02:05:35,175 --> 02:05:42,517
[SPEAKER_33]: Talking about tweaking, I don't think that's going to happen very easily after this has been put into effect.

1618
02:05:44,237 --> 02:05:52,239
[SPEAKER_33]: And I have heard too, now I don't want to say this for sure, but I have heard that there have been complaints about Republic Parking.

1619
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:59,485
[SPEAKER_33]: Because what happens is when you put in your license plate, you don't get anything on your windshield.

1620
02:06:00,065 --> 02:06:02,367
[SPEAKER_33]: It goes to your house, to your address.

1621
02:06:03,168 --> 02:06:09,453
[SPEAKER_33]: And occasionally, by the time it's come to your address, you already have a late fee.

1622
02:06:10,754 --> 02:06:15,138
[SPEAKER_33]: And trying to get in contact, not with City Hall, that's easy enough.

1623
02:06:15,622 --> 02:06:27,029
[SPEAKER_33]: not with even Boston, but get in contact with a big company in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to explain that you didn't get this in time, to pay it in time, is a big problem.

1624
02:06:28,329 --> 02:06:38,415
[SPEAKER_33]: And I'm really afraid this is going to create a huge disruption in West Medford, in terms of its culture and its climate.

1625
02:06:38,795 --> 02:06:39,936
[SPEAKER_33]: I love the stores.

1626
02:06:39,976 --> 02:06:40,636
[SPEAKER_33]: They're wonderful.

1627
02:06:41,037 --> 02:06:43,178
[SPEAKER_33]: They won't exist if people have to pay them.

1628
02:06:43,498 --> 02:06:45,039
[SPEAKER_33]: There are also things about how much

1629
02:06:45,478 --> 02:06:59,867
[SPEAKER_33]: The businesses have to pay to have parking for the owners, for their employees, that on top of, I believe, I read it in your article, Penta, that that could break the backs of some of these businesses.

1630
02:07:00,888 --> 02:07:05,791
[SPEAKER_33]: And then the last point I'd like to make is everyone, or people who are for it, say just get used to it.

1631
02:07:07,892 --> 02:07:13,216
[SPEAKER_33]: We can and do get used to anything, but it's like frogs who are put into

1632
02:07:13,773 --> 02:07:18,214
[SPEAKER_33]: a pot of water, cold water, and then you turn up the heat and finally they're cooked.

1633
02:07:19,594 --> 02:07:28,496
[SPEAKER_33]: So I don't want to get used to that because the way it was done, the possible effects, there are many other things that could have been done.

1634
02:07:29,136 --> 02:07:36,838
[SPEAKER_33]: Local people, maybe hiring another traffic officer or employing local people.

1635
02:07:36,958 --> 02:07:42,939
[SPEAKER_33]: We do not need to outsource to Tennessee to get something done for our community.

1636
02:07:45,035 --> 02:07:51,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1637
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:52,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1638
02:07:52,301 --> 02:07:54,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Bob Capucci is 71 Evans street.

1639
02:07:54,343 --> 02:07:55,504
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll try to be very brief.

1640
02:07:56,304 --> 02:08:06,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I, I hope that this kiosk issue is a watershed event that that'll speak to the larger issue of, of our city.

1641
02:08:07,093 --> 02:08:12,578
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, look at all these citizens that are coming up here tonight that didn't even know this was coming.

1642
02:08:12,975 --> 02:08:15,596
[SPEAKER_13]: All the problems it's gonna cause for these people.

1643
02:08:16,096 --> 02:08:25,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Even some of the details that, with all due respect, the chief and the company that put these in aren't quite sure about yet, in terms of rules and whatnot.

1644
02:08:25,879 --> 02:08:27,460
[SPEAKER_13]: We're a city of about 58,000.

1645
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:30,120
[SPEAKER_13]: We have 38,000 registered voters.

1646
02:08:30,561 --> 02:08:36,182
[SPEAKER_13]: In any municipal election cycle, maybe 9,000 people come out to vote.

1647
02:08:38,303 --> 02:08:41,064
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope that this kiosk, and this is an election year,

1648
02:08:41,615 --> 02:08:51,943
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope that this kiosk event is a watershed event and we have 20,000 people come out and vote this year because our city charter needs to be changed.

1649
02:08:52,443 --> 02:09:01,070
[SPEAKER_13]: We need a city council that's going to be able to put forward a charter commission review.

1650
02:09:01,110 --> 02:09:02,311
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been almost 30 years.

1651
02:09:04,853 --> 02:09:11,418
[SPEAKER_13]: With all due respect, there are always four votes that always go the mayor's way on this city council.

1652
02:09:12,971 --> 02:09:22,177
[SPEAKER_13]: And when the votes don't go their way, I don't mean to digress, but for instance, the million dollar, actually a $680,000 offer by Councillor Penta a few months ago,

1653
02:09:28,528 --> 02:09:40,456
[SPEAKER_13]: on the water pipes, when that passes, even when we get a miracle of that fourth vote, to go against something, this mayor who has all power in this city, it's too much power in any one office, he vetoes it.

1654
02:09:41,097 --> 02:09:53,145
[SPEAKER_13]: So even if this city council comes up with a resolution tonight of seven to nothing in the affirmative to help all these people and businesses that are confused about it, what's to stop the mayor from just saying, no, I'm doing it my way anyway?

1655
02:09:54,066 --> 02:09:57,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Please, Medford City Council, you have the authority to review our city charter,

1656
02:09:57,955 --> 02:10:06,418
[SPEAKER_13]: It's long overdue to be changed, or let's hope that this kiosk event is a watershed event, and the people that you represent.

1657
02:10:06,458 --> 02:10:10,019
[SPEAKER_13]: When I come and address this council, I'm seeing my neighbors on Evans Street.

1658
02:10:10,099 --> 02:10:11,439
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm seeing my neighbors up in the Heights.

1659
02:10:11,759 --> 02:10:13,240
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm seeing local business owners.

1660
02:10:14,980 --> 02:10:24,763
[SPEAKER_13]: It really needs to change, and we really need the voices that you folks need to be in a city that's dominated by the mayor's office.

1661
02:10:24,783 --> 02:10:25,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

1662
02:10:25,504 --> 02:10:26,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

1663
02:10:31,266 --> 02:10:33,448
[SPEAKER_24]: Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

1664
02:10:33,808 --> 02:10:36,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Maria Baker, 22 Summit Road in Medford.

1665
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:42,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the owner, director, operator of Play Academy Learning Center at 65 Riverside Ave in Medford.

1666
02:10:43,555 --> 02:10:52,161
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to say that I have had many concerns, and I have emailed all of you, so I imagine you are all familiar with what my concerns are.

1667
02:10:52,701 --> 02:10:59,526
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am happy to say that most of my concerns are being dealt with, and I really feel positive about that.

1668
02:11:00,882 --> 02:11:04,484
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of my anxieties have been taken care of.

1669
02:11:04,504 --> 02:11:21,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with that, it has taken a little bit of time, and I need to manage all the anxieties and concerns of my customers throughout these past couple days that the parking program appears to be live, even though we keep hearing it's mid-January.

1670
02:11:21,090 --> 02:11:24,832
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm dealing with that with the customers and trying to help them out.

1671
02:11:25,326 --> 02:11:31,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that the meters are taking money, and so, you know, I'm just a little bit confused about that.

1672
02:11:31,592 --> 02:11:49,489
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of things that I think there's confusion about, and I have some questions here that I'd like to just maybe list out, and I understand the representatives here are here to answer our questions, and so if it would be okay for me to just list them out, and then we could get some answers, if not today, then when they're ready, and have answers to these questions.

1673
02:11:51,185 --> 02:11:53,486
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing maybe isn't for them, but more for the city.

1674
02:11:54,947 --> 02:12:12,194
[SPEAKER_01]: On East Transit Way where I have two emergency exits there, and in the past when we shovel, because those are my emergency exits, what has happened is that the snow plows come along and they plow all of the snow right back up onto the sidewalk and block my emergency exits.

1675
02:12:12,694 --> 02:12:14,915
[SPEAKER_01]: That is also where the kiosks are.

1676
02:12:15,015 --> 02:12:16,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And so along the lines of the snow removal,

1677
02:12:18,192 --> 02:12:27,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Will the city now that we have this money coming in from these parking meters and everything that's going on with this program, will we now be able to remove snow?

1678
02:12:28,279 --> 02:12:30,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just push snow, but can we remove snow?

1679
02:12:31,262 --> 02:12:41,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in order to have these parking spaces now be worth paying for, it would be really nice if we didn't have to somehow hurdle over these snow banks.

1680
02:12:41,129 --> 02:12:43,851
[SPEAKER_01]: These snow banks are going to be in front of these kiosks.

1681
02:12:44,264 --> 02:12:57,609
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about, I've heard mention about the fact that it's going to be a shared responsibility and all of that, and that likely there won't be any citations if the kiosk isn't working.

1682
02:12:57,709 --> 02:13:06,213
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there, how does the person issuing the citation know that the kiosk isn't working or isn't accessible or whatever the case is?

1683
02:13:06,793 --> 02:13:13,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the resident then going to receive a citation and have to go through the trouble of defending themselves and that sort of trouble?

1684
02:13:13,076 --> 02:13:13,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I just would love to know.

1685
02:13:14,329 --> 02:13:22,793
[SPEAKER_01]: how exactly that works and how they know, how they're alerted that the kiosk is not accessible so that that would make things a little bit easier.

1686
02:13:23,194 --> 02:13:25,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's lots of different information.

1687
02:13:25,215 --> 02:13:27,216
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a little bit about the two-hour parking.

1688
02:13:27,236 --> 02:13:28,916
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of confusion about that.

1689
02:13:29,337 --> 02:13:41,603
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I park in one part of Medford Square for two hours and then later on in the day need to do another set of errands and I go to another part of Medford Square and want to pay for two hours, am I not allowed to do that?

1690
02:13:41,623 --> 02:13:42,884
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are confused.

1691
02:13:43,894 --> 02:13:48,117
[SPEAKER_01]: they can only pay for 2 hours, period, for the entire day in Medford.

1692
02:13:48,457 --> 02:13:49,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that that's not the case.

1693
02:13:50,298 --> 02:13:55,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to think that you can move your car and go someplace else in Medford, even just move your car to a different space.

1694
02:13:56,482 --> 02:13:59,524
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that there's a lot of question around that.

1695
02:13:59,544 --> 02:14:00,365
[SPEAKER_01]: There's confusion.

1696
02:14:01,345 --> 02:14:05,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question that I have is the technology when we put our credit cards and debit cards in.

1697
02:14:06,349 --> 02:14:11,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that personally I've had my credit card identity and all the information stolen because

1698
02:14:12,042 --> 02:14:19,044
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people out there who install cameras, and so when you insert your credit card and pull it out, everything is recorded and pulled.

1699
02:14:19,404 --> 02:14:22,845
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question is, how secure are these kiosks?

1700
02:14:23,305 --> 02:14:34,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some sort of system in place where they're checked for these cameras that maybe are being installed, and whether or not there is even something to deter that from happening on these machines in the first place?

1701
02:14:35,858 --> 02:14:47,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just right off of that point, if I want to go on my phone instead of going on to a kiosk to pay for my parking, I understand that there's a $0.35 per transaction fee.

1702
02:14:47,782 --> 02:14:52,464
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit high if, in fact, I only need to go in for $0.15 or

1703
02:14:55,168 --> 02:15:17,462
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here I am, $0.25, $0.50 into a meter cost, but now I need to tack on to that $0.35, which I think that in today's day and age, a lot of people probably would want to use that as a convenience, especially families with young children, maybe business owners who want to help out their customers who are elderly, who come to them and say, I don't understand this kiosk, can you help me?

1704
02:15:17,502 --> 02:15:20,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could pull out my smartphone and say, here we go, I'll help you.

1705
02:15:20,706 --> 02:15:21,666
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, muddle through it.

1706
02:15:21,886 --> 02:15:30,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now there's a $0.35 transaction fee for every time you do that, and that just seems high, and I hope that that is either reduced or goes away.

1707
02:15:30,809 --> 02:15:45,233
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more questions I have is, can these kiosks be programmed so that, for example, why, if it's not live right now, why is this machine taking money from people who are parking?

1708
02:15:45,515 --> 02:16:01,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we program it so that when there are snowstorms and somebody goes over, because as a business owner or somebody, you know, I send someone down to shovel out my place, and now they see that they have parking that they need to pay for, will the machine not accept their money because it's snowing?

1709
02:16:01,798 --> 02:16:07,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Will the machine not accept money during times that it is non-operational?

1710
02:16:07,999 --> 02:16:13,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever the reason is that, you know, there might be times that it's decided that they're not to take the money.

1711
02:16:14,434 --> 02:16:16,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that programmed right in there?

1712
02:16:17,016 --> 02:16:30,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my last question is, with this enforcement, is that if somebody blocks a handicap ramp or a hydrant, is that going to be enforced by the city, like the police, or is that going to be enforced by Republic?

1713
02:16:31,126 --> 02:16:40,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm not sure who that would be, because that, you know, right in front of my business there is a hydrant there, and often that does get blocked, and often handicap ramps

1714
02:16:41,237 --> 02:16:54,122
[SPEAKER_01]: are blocked and I'm really close to the senior center and it kills me to see that senior citizens struggle when they're trying to walk along and they're walkers or whatever and they can't because the handicap ramp is blocked.

1715
02:16:54,162 --> 02:16:56,843
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it would be really nice to see that sort of enforcement too.

1716
02:16:57,383 --> 02:17:00,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my questions and hopefully we get some answers.

1717
02:17:00,644 --> 02:17:00,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1718
02:17:07,652 --> 02:17:08,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Conflict car of yellow.

1719
02:17:08,993 --> 02:17:12,174
[SPEAKER_16]: If we maybe let the gentleman answer some of those concerns before someone else speaks.

1720
02:17:12,474 --> 02:17:16,256
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could, um, it's as if you, uh, okay.

1721
02:17:16,496 --> 02:17:20,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I was going to just be a few minutes, but okay.

1722
02:17:20,398 --> 02:17:20,858
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1723
02:17:20,898 --> 02:17:24,079
[SPEAKER_24]: We've heard the, uh, gentlemen could address some of those pieces.

1724
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:29,222
[SPEAKER_27]: I will try and remember them all, but I think I, do you need anything?

1725
02:17:29,282 --> 02:17:29,322
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh,

1726
02:17:30,562 --> 02:17:39,946
[SPEAKER_27]: First thing, Republic Parking has leased office space here in Medford, and we are a paying business here.

1727
02:17:40,446 --> 02:17:49,270
[SPEAKER_27]: We are based out of Chattanooga, Tennessee, but we also have employed five Medford residents to be on our staff, and they're very familiar with the program here.

1728
02:17:50,291 --> 02:17:56,093
[SPEAKER_27]: They've interacted with a number of the citizens that have already come to our office to purchase their residential permit or stop by with questions.

1729
02:17:58,449 --> 02:18:05,755
[SPEAKER_27]: On the enforcement of, uh, any violation that's currently on the books will be enforced jointly by Republic Park and staff.

1730
02:18:06,896 --> 02:18:10,459
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry, as public parking staff as well as the police.

1731
02:18:10,999 --> 02:18:12,841
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll be working jointly on enforcement.

1732
02:18:13,501 --> 02:18:27,773
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, the kiosk, as far as credit card security have, the lady was referring to a skimming device and that is, that machine is designed to prevent any sort of skimming device from being attached to it.

1733
02:18:28,399 --> 02:18:33,343
[SPEAKER_27]: All of the credit card information is transmitted completely by PCI compliance standards.

1734
02:18:34,023 --> 02:18:38,607
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not stored anywhere, which is the primary rule of PCI compliance.

1735
02:18:39,327 --> 02:18:41,509
[SPEAKER_27]: So the security is there for the citizenry.

1736
02:18:49,274 --> 02:18:52,537
[SPEAKER_27]: There was a question about a citation being mailed to the residents.

1737
02:18:53,247 --> 02:18:54,149
[SPEAKER_27]: That is not the case.

1738
02:18:54,810 --> 02:19:02,761
[SPEAKER_27]: If there is a violation and a citation is issued, it will be placed on the vehicle as the first notice per Massachusetts statute.

1739
02:19:03,362 --> 02:19:05,925
[SPEAKER_27]: So that is an inaccuracy out there.

1740
02:19:09,686 --> 02:19:09,926
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1741
02:19:10,166 --> 02:19:14,330
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, all of the kiosks are communicating to one central server, which is great.

1742
02:19:14,350 --> 02:19:19,915
[SPEAKER_27]: It allows for real time information to be available to city police, all of our staff.

1743
02:19:20,435 --> 02:19:31,645
[SPEAKER_27]: If there's a kiosk out of order, vandalized, uh, jammed out of a paper receipts, whatever it may be, we receive notification of that immediately so that we can address the issue.

1744
02:19:32,145 --> 02:19:36,529
[SPEAKER_27]: And at that point, all of our officers will be aware that they are not to enforce that specific meter.

1745
02:19:37,192 --> 02:19:43,056
[SPEAKER_27]: If we have a snow issue where they're inaccessible, that determination will be made before they go out on their beach to do the enforcement.

1746
02:19:43,677 --> 02:19:47,359
[SPEAKER_27]: So that'll be easily communicated to the officers and should not be an issue.

1747
02:19:49,441 --> 02:19:54,264
[SPEAKER_27]: The pay by sell is a convenience program and it's rolling out in cities across the country.

1748
02:19:54,745 --> 02:20:01,730
[SPEAKER_27]: That service is actually provided by a third party company and the 35 cent transaction fee is pretty much universal.

1749
02:20:02,350 --> 02:20:04,612
[SPEAKER_27]: That goes to cover their cost of technology

1750
02:20:05,090 --> 02:20:12,712
[SPEAKER_27]: As part of that fee, they absorb the cost of the credit cards, the PCI compliance issues, and all the advertising that goes into the program.

1751
02:20:13,272 --> 02:20:20,034
[SPEAKER_27]: The great thing about the pay-by-sale company that we've selected here is that they're the same company that's in place in Somerville.

1752
02:20:20,534 --> 02:20:24,756
[SPEAKER_27]: So we already have a large number of users that can instantly roll into the program.

1753
02:20:25,196 --> 02:20:28,697
[SPEAKER_27]: And if they choose to use the service, there is the convenience fee in place.

1754
02:20:29,117 --> 02:20:33,078
[SPEAKER_27]: But that, as I said, is a third-party company that provides that technology for us.

1755
02:20:35,945 --> 02:20:38,648
[SPEAKER_18]: Through the chair, thank you, President Del Russo.

1756
02:20:39,329 --> 02:20:45,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that a one-time $0.35 fee, or every time you park, if you need 15 minutes, you have to pay $0.25 plus $0.35?

1757
02:20:46,238 --> 02:20:48,240
[SPEAKER_27]: It's per transaction.

1758
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:51,845
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you purchase $2, and again, it's optional.

1759
02:20:51,865 --> 02:20:55,169
[SPEAKER_27]: You'll be able to use a credit card or pay coins at the meter.

1760
02:21:01,782 --> 02:21:07,005
[SPEAKER_32]: So there could actually be an instance where we pay $0.50 to park our spot and $0.70 in fees.

1761
02:21:09,466 --> 02:21:16,029
[SPEAKER_26]: If you put $0.25 on the meter and you have to pay by your phone $0.25 for 15 minutes, then they charge you $0.35 on the $0.25.

1762
02:21:16,070 --> 02:21:17,870
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's over 100%.

1763
02:21:18,611 --> 02:21:20,772
[SPEAKER_26]: If you choose to use the service for that transaction.

1764
02:21:21,112 --> 02:21:27,055
[SPEAKER_26]: And then say we put another $0.25 in because we were going over our 15 minutes on our phone.

1765
02:21:27,135 --> 02:21:30,357
[SPEAKER_26]: We added time to the meter, which is a capability, as I understand.

1766
02:21:30,657 --> 02:21:33,279
[SPEAKER_26]: We'd be charged another 35 cents for adding another quarter run.

1767
02:21:33,819 --> 02:21:35,821
[SPEAKER_26]: If you choose to do that, that would be the transaction.

1768
02:21:35,861 --> 02:21:40,464
[SPEAKER_26]: So in essence, for a 50 cent, half an hour spot, I'd be paying a dollar 25.

1769
02:21:41,405 --> 02:21:45,247
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, but it is optional and it's, it's well defined to the users.

1770
02:21:45,288 --> 02:21:47,349
[SPEAKER_27]: So there will be no hidden, hidden fees.

1771
02:21:47,869 --> 02:21:57,276
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, I wouldn't be so sure to say that because today councilor Caviello and I went down to Bocelli's to have dinner and I went to the kiosk and I put my credit card information and everything like that.

1772
02:21:57,296 --> 02:21:59,738
[SPEAKER_26]: And I wasn't, I was unable to pay through my, through my,

1773
02:22:00,508 --> 02:22:06,409
[SPEAKER_26]: Park Medford application today and I put the money in, but when I read the terms and conditions, I didn't see that there would be an additional fee.

1774
02:22:06,429 --> 02:22:16,791
[SPEAKER_27]: And then when I read the terms and conditions on the pipe and when I put my credit information in the pay by cell for Park Medford is not available as of yet, it'll be rolling out this month.

1775
02:22:17,571 --> 02:22:24,712
[SPEAKER_27]: So that information, once you sign up for the program will be, you'll agree to that and you'll sign off on that when you register for the program.

1776
02:22:25,232 --> 02:22:26,032
[SPEAKER_26]: I already did register.

1777
02:22:26,052 --> 02:22:27,333
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a key.

1778
02:22:27,433 --> 02:22:29,573
[SPEAKER_26]: I haven't, if I go to Somerville, I can use my,

1779
02:22:30,782 --> 02:22:31,482
[SPEAKER_26]: device, right?

1780
02:22:32,122 --> 02:22:35,343
[SPEAKER_26]: Because you guys are the same company and you have the same database and all that, right?

1781
02:22:35,583 --> 02:22:35,744
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1782
02:22:35,784 --> 02:22:39,885
[SPEAKER_27]: So in Somerville, if you signed up for that, that information should be the same.

1783
02:22:39,925 --> 02:22:42,245
[SPEAKER_27]: In Somerville, there's a $0.35 transaction fee as well.

1784
02:22:42,446 --> 02:22:43,386
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I didn't sign up.

1785
02:22:43,426 --> 02:22:46,047
[SPEAKER_26]: I signed up in Medford, but I'm saying it's not available in Medford.

1786
02:22:46,067 --> 02:22:50,308
[SPEAKER_26]: But if I drove across the city to Somerville and I booked, would that same transaction fee apply?

1787
02:22:50,348 --> 02:22:51,168
[SPEAKER_26]: And I guess the answer is yes?

1788
02:22:51,348 --> 02:22:51,588
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1789
02:22:51,708 --> 02:22:51,928
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

1790
02:22:53,009 --> 02:22:58,410
[SPEAKER_26]: And is that part of the contract that the third-party vendor has put together between Republican and you?

1791
02:22:58,450 --> 02:23:00,591
[SPEAKER_26]: Or is that part of this contract that's governing

1792
02:23:00,921 --> 02:23:02,903
[SPEAKER_26]: the relationship between the city of Medford and Republic?

1793
02:23:03,183 --> 02:23:06,746
[SPEAKER_27]: The contract between park mobile is with Republic Park.

1794
02:23:07,187 --> 02:23:13,252
[SPEAKER_27]: And we presented that in our official proposal response to the RFP that was issued by the city to utilize that service.

1795
02:23:15,995 --> 02:23:18,057
[SPEAKER_27]: Point of further clarification.

1796
02:23:18,277 --> 02:23:24,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you saying that you already provided that to the city, but, and you're just rolling it out now?

1797
02:23:24,583 --> 02:23:25,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that in the contract?

1798
02:23:27,053 --> 02:23:30,955
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, it's in the RFP response, which is a part of the contract that we signed.

1799
02:23:31,035 --> 02:23:33,277
[SPEAKER_14]: I have all your responses, but that was never explained to us.

1800
02:23:33,337 --> 02:23:42,462
[SPEAKER_14]: And another thing on the like venue, if I go online and I want to get a permit parking, a $10 permit parking, they're charging me $3 to go online to get a $10.

1801
02:23:42,542 --> 02:23:43,382
[SPEAKER_14]: That's extortion.

1802
02:23:43,983 --> 02:23:44,703
[SPEAKER_14]: 30% on a $10?

1803
02:23:45,183 --> 02:23:46,884
[SPEAKER_14]: On a $10?

1804
02:23:47,845 --> 02:23:50,627
[SPEAKER_14]: When people before could come down to City Hall and get it for nothing?

1805
02:23:51,127 --> 02:23:54,329
[SPEAKER_27]: They can still come to our office and pay no additional fees.

1806
02:23:54,949 --> 02:23:56,350
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about going online.

1807
02:23:57,672 --> 02:23:59,133
[SPEAKER_14]: to make it easier for the customer.

1808
02:23:59,153 --> 02:24:03,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight just alluded to the fact you have to pay 35 cents to put a 25 cent time period in.

1809
02:24:04,098 --> 02:24:06,960
[SPEAKER_14]: So you are charging 30% to buy a $10 to buy.

1810
02:24:07,361 --> 02:24:09,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1811
02:24:09,803 --> 02:24:11,885
[SPEAKER_11]: This is technology today.

1812
02:24:11,945 --> 02:24:18,591
[SPEAKER_11]: The City of Medford actually charges a fee when you pay your tax bills online or a parking citation currently through the City of Medford.

1813
02:24:18,611 --> 02:24:19,952
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to let Councilor Pinto know.

1814
02:24:19,972 --> 02:24:20,412
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a 30% charge.

1815
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:26,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor, it's a nominal fee, but 30 cents.

1816
02:24:26,843 --> 02:24:31,445
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not, you know, listen, you guys are here only for one reason to make money.

1817
02:24:31,705 --> 02:24:32,646
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the bottom line.

1818
02:24:32,686 --> 02:24:37,729
[SPEAKER_14]: And we understand that, but I'm here to make sure that you don't make money and give the city back to the people.

1819
02:24:37,969 --> 02:24:40,270
[SPEAKER_14]: So let them figure out what they need to do.

1820
02:24:41,911 --> 02:24:42,231
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1821
02:24:42,251 --> 02:24:44,312
[SPEAKER_24]: The points of information have been made.

1822
02:24:45,013 --> 02:24:51,056
[SPEAKER_24]: And, uh, if we could resume, uh, unless you have any more, uh, questions to answer.

1823
02:24:51,942 --> 02:24:54,604
[SPEAKER_27]: we'd like to resume conversation with the citizens again.

1824
02:24:54,764 --> 02:24:54,884
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure.

1825
02:24:54,924 --> 02:24:57,025
[SPEAKER_27]: There was one more question that we can answer at this time.

1826
02:24:57,325 --> 02:25:02,929
[SPEAKER_27]: We can turn off the machines instantaneously if need be for a storm or emergency situation.

1827
02:25:03,029 --> 02:25:13,416
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you pop was and leave that spot and go to another spot, can they go to another spot of that?

1828
02:25:13,496 --> 02:25:14,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that it for the day?

1829
02:25:14,256 --> 02:25:15,177
[SPEAKER_14]: You only can do two hours.

1830
02:25:15,757 --> 02:25:16,017
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1831
02:25:16,238 --> 02:25:17,538
[SPEAKER_27]: It's in line with the current ordinance.

1832
02:25:17,578 --> 02:25:18,179
[SPEAKER_27]: That's exactly.

1833
02:25:18,199 --> 02:25:20,060
[SPEAKER_27]: You can move, you can move within the city.

1834
02:25:21,082 --> 02:25:25,045
[SPEAKER_27]: You just cannot park in the same spot for two hours, more than two hours.

1835
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:44,018
[SPEAKER_27]: The technology that we're using, the license plate recognition system, when it identifies a vehicle parked on a specific street, it has the latitude and longitude and photographs of the vehicle.

1836
02:25:44,905 --> 02:25:54,451
[SPEAKER_27]: So when it comes back on that same street, it's able to compare a current photograph to a previous photograph, the license plates, and determine how long the vehicle has stayed.

1837
02:25:55,132 --> 02:25:57,213
[SPEAKER_27]: That information is available to our officer.

1838
02:25:57,253 --> 02:25:58,454
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the margin of error?

1839
02:25:59,835 --> 02:26:01,356
[SPEAKER_27]: The margin of error is none.

1840
02:26:03,097 --> 02:26:10,982
[SPEAKER_27]: Because the officer is able to view the pictures with the information to determine if a violation has occurred.

1841
02:26:11,588 --> 02:26:20,074
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to determine if you're in that same spot, even though our spots currently aren't clearly marked, you're going to be able to tell if they're in that same exact spot.

1842
02:26:20,334 --> 02:26:20,534
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1843
02:26:20,574 --> 02:26:23,376
[SPEAKER_27]: We're using latitude and longitude and photographic evidence.

1844
02:26:23,456 --> 02:26:26,058
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's very easy to determine if a violation has occurred.

1845
02:26:27,018 --> 02:26:27,339
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1846
02:26:27,699 --> 02:26:28,059
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1847
02:26:28,119 --> 02:26:28,900
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor mocks.

1848
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,102
[SPEAKER_24]: If we could receive resume, uh, Mrs. Consistio, is it?

1849
02:26:36,151 --> 02:26:40,515
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is still Millie Casasio and I still live at 289 Elm Street.

1850
02:26:41,315 --> 02:26:46,000
[SPEAKER_04]: When I said before about, you know, so many stories going around.

1851
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:48,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I sat down, I felt a little better.

1852
02:26:48,962 --> 02:26:50,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I am totally confused.

1853
02:26:52,345 --> 02:26:52,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.

1854
02:26:53,526 --> 02:27:01,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, part of it, you know, this business about the senior center and they mentioned about setting up

1855
02:27:02,672 --> 02:27:04,232
[SPEAKER_04]: a separate park for it.

1856
02:27:04,773 --> 02:27:13,655
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, but now, how are you gonna know that everybody that's parked in that is a senior citizen?

1857
02:27:14,095 --> 02:27:27,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I know a friend of mine who lives in Gloucester, they can go to the town hall and they can get a sticker for their car, because anybody could come, you know, park their car and, oh, it's the senior center, what do I care?

1858
02:27:28,038 --> 02:27:28,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just gonna park.

1859
02:27:29,719 --> 02:27:30,799
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you gonna tell that?

1860
02:27:32,807 --> 02:27:58,721
[SPEAKER_24]: If, if I may, from the chair, it sounds to me like what the chief was saying that not every detail is worked out yet, but they've identified certain spots within the city, particularly at the senior center, which is due for major facelift, as you know, uh, in landscaping redesign that, um,

1861
02:27:59,613 --> 02:28:12,738
[SPEAKER_24]: uh, the area adjacent will be, uh, assessed and, uh, a means is going to be figured out as to how to achieve that to registering your car with a sticker is, uh, one of those means.

1862
02:28:12,798 --> 02:28:20,681
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's something that they're, uh, examining as an option, but clearly, uh, something needs to be done there.

1863
02:28:21,182 --> 02:28:23,983
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think the message has been made loud and clear.

1864
02:28:24,722 --> 02:28:33,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the main reason I brought it up again is because I didn't hear that, and I just thought, I'll suggest that.

1865
02:28:34,051 --> 02:28:35,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll suggest that.

1866
02:28:36,254 --> 02:28:41,999
[SPEAKER_04]: But, and again, the business then too, like some of these people, I don't do it.

1867
02:28:42,993 --> 02:28:43,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

1868
02:28:43,393 --> 02:28:45,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm never there more than two hours, okay?

1869
02:28:46,396 --> 02:28:55,543
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know people, they go and they take the ceramics class and they take the knitting class and it's a social thing.

1870
02:28:55,623 --> 02:28:59,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those people, it's the only social thing they have.

1871
02:29:00,046 --> 02:29:05,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had thought when I was up here a few minutes ago that

1872
02:29:05,650 --> 02:29:13,481
[SPEAKER_04]: If they were there for three hours, it wouldn't be a problem, but it sounds like they would still have to move their car.

1873
02:29:13,902 --> 02:29:18,849
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the chief was saying that's not the case, but what we have to be wary of

1874
02:29:19,773 --> 02:29:25,296
[SPEAKER_24]: is Mr. Smith from Winchester going to find that out and park there so he can.

1875
02:29:25,336 --> 02:29:34,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's, but that's why I said seniors, you need to, for seniors, if the seniors that you need to have some identification.

1876
02:29:34,402 --> 02:29:37,104
[SPEAKER_04]: So people won't be doing that because people will do it.

1877
02:29:37,704 --> 02:29:38,484
[SPEAKER_04]: They will do it.

1878
02:29:38,564 --> 02:29:39,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

1879
02:29:39,465 --> 02:29:39,805
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1880
02:29:39,865 --> 02:29:41,686
[SPEAKER_24]: And the chief is right behind you to respond.

1881
02:29:42,947 --> 02:29:44,468
[SPEAKER_24]: Your neighbor just,

1882
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:47,761
[SPEAKER_21]: Just some information on that.

1883
02:29:47,821 --> 02:29:55,464
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be working very closely with Pam Kelly, the director of the Council on Aging, and the person in charge of the senior center.

1884
02:29:56,865 --> 02:30:15,513
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be working something out, whether it's a placard that will have to be displayed on their dashboard, but it'll be something clearly identifiable so that, I think we're trying to stay away from issuance of decals that give people a time that they can park any day they want to park there and, you know, get on the bus and go to Mohegan or Foxwood or wherever.

1885
02:30:16,009 --> 02:30:17,790
[SPEAKER_21]: This will be strictly for the center itself.

1886
02:30:18,671 --> 02:30:25,916
[SPEAKER_21]: And some staff person from the center may have to go out and put the leaflets on the dashboards for the people.

1887
02:30:26,736 --> 02:30:27,076
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1888
02:30:28,677 --> 02:30:29,438
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor, yes.

1889
02:30:29,498 --> 02:30:31,779
[SPEAKER_24]: And we want to allow some of the citizens to speak.

1890
02:30:31,799 --> 02:30:32,760
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to respond to the chief.

1891
02:30:35,202 --> 02:30:39,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, I believe there's approximately eight parking spaces in the front of the senior center.

1892
02:30:40,445 --> 02:30:44,348
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of the times they will park across the street in the parking lot over there.

1893
02:30:45,122 --> 02:30:48,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I have two pictures here that were taken at nighttime.

1894
02:30:49,431 --> 02:30:53,534
[SPEAKER_14]: You have two kiosks against the business wall of that parking lot.

1895
02:30:54,034 --> 02:31:01,119
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's a picture of the parking lot for which somebody would have to walk from the sidewalk, where those businesses are, all the way to the ring road.

1896
02:31:01,459 --> 02:31:02,820
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not one kiosk.

1897
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:05,221
[SPEAKER_14]: How is anyone supposed to figure that out?

1898
02:31:05,321 --> 02:31:09,564
[SPEAKER_14]: And especially at nighttime, when it's dark out, you can't even see these kiosks.

1899
02:31:09,804 --> 02:31:10,945
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't have to pay overnight.

1900
02:31:10,965 --> 02:31:11,626
[SPEAKER_21]: 7 p.m., it's over.

1901
02:31:11,646 --> 02:31:12,246
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you talking about?

1902
02:31:12,266 --> 02:31:14,047
[SPEAKER_14]: At 4 o'clock at nighttime, it's dark out.

1903
02:31:14,427 --> 02:31:15,008
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can't see.

1904
02:31:15,028 --> 02:31:15,908
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you going to see these?

1905
02:31:16,229 --> 02:31:16,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Against the wall.

1906
02:31:17,169 --> 02:31:18,190
[SPEAKER_14]: And if somebody's coming in,

1907
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:28,233
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they're a guest at the senior center and not knowing that they have to go to a kiosk, what are they going to walk, 150 feet to go put money in a kiosk?

1908
02:31:29,153 --> 02:31:36,575
[SPEAKER_21]: There's also a kiosk on the sidewalk, on the backside, on the Clippership Drive side, right where the flashing lights for the crosswalk is.

1909
02:31:36,595 --> 02:31:38,916
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's even further away than the parking lot is here.

1910
02:31:38,936 --> 02:31:41,917
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's the main door of the center is on that side.

1911
02:31:43,917 --> 02:31:48,360
[SPEAKER_14]: When seniors, when they have their Christmas thing and whatever it might be, they may get 100, 150 people.

1912
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:51,762
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes it might go to two or three hours, whatever the event might be.

1913
02:31:52,102 --> 02:31:55,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Why should they be worrying about having to come out and put money in a meter?

1914
02:31:55,264 --> 02:31:56,425
[SPEAKER_21]: They do not have to worry about it.

1915
02:31:56,445 --> 02:31:58,366
[SPEAKER_21]: As I said, we're going to be working with the director of the center.

1916
02:31:58,386 --> 02:31:59,947
[SPEAKER_14]: But why wasn't this thought out ahead of time?

1917
02:31:59,987 --> 02:32:04,070
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the whole issue of not having meetings ahead of time to discuss these matters.

1918
02:32:04,090 --> 02:32:09,353
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I can just tell you, based on the nature of the phone calls that my office has been receiving, Alvin's been getting all those calls.

1919
02:32:10,526 --> 02:32:15,788
[SPEAKER_21]: People who live in apartments above the stores in Medford Square want the city to decide where they're going to park.

1920
02:32:16,208 --> 02:32:16,948
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I'm sorry.

1921
02:32:17,568 --> 02:32:19,289
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to have to find your own space.

1922
02:32:19,729 --> 02:32:24,991
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll make an accommodation for the senior center based on the population that attends there, and we'll work with the people.

1923
02:32:25,011 --> 02:32:27,211
[SPEAKER_21]: But we cannot create parking spaces for people.

1924
02:32:27,571 --> 02:32:28,332
[SPEAKER_21]: They will have to look.

1925
02:32:28,432 --> 02:32:30,892
[SPEAKER_21]: We cannot satisfy every whim that comes up.

1926
02:32:31,213 --> 02:32:32,453
[SPEAKER_21]: We could have had 1,000 meetings.

1927
02:32:32,473 --> 02:32:35,174
[SPEAKER_21]: We could have met every single day for six months.

1928
02:32:36,084 --> 02:32:40,575
[SPEAKER_21]: We still would not be touching every issue that comes up because there is always another issue.

1929
02:32:41,277 --> 02:32:45,908
[SPEAKER_14]: But having always another issue is good to create the idea that had you had these meetings.

1930
02:32:46,368 --> 02:32:47,990
[SPEAKER_14]: These issues would be minimal now.

1931
02:32:48,290 --> 02:32:49,131
[SPEAKER_14]: These are major.

1932
02:32:49,371 --> 02:32:58,800
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's happening is the small businessman, who's the lifeline of this community, is at risk because they're worried about their customers, whether they come back or not, whether they have appropriate parking.

1933
02:32:59,060 --> 02:33:03,844
[SPEAKER_14]: And now, as Councilor Monk just alluded to, and I heard it earlier tonight, a special validation program.

1934
02:33:04,145 --> 02:33:04,905
[SPEAKER_14]: So what are we going to do?

1935
02:33:05,126 --> 02:33:10,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care of special people that contributed to the mayor's office and make sure that their tickets are taken care of?

1936
02:33:14,378 --> 02:33:15,418
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Pente.

1937
02:33:15,438 --> 02:33:16,379
[SPEAKER_24]: You've made your point.

1938
02:33:17,599 --> 02:33:20,580
[SPEAKER_24]: If we can, Chief, do you need to?

1939
02:33:22,261 --> 02:33:31,004
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll let it pass, but just the one comment I want to make is that just reinforcing the point, every single day there's going to be another issue.

1940
02:33:31,444 --> 02:33:34,005
[SPEAKER_21]: This thing has to get up and running and we'll have to tweak it.

1941
02:33:35,545 --> 02:33:40,407
[SPEAKER_21]: I know there's been some talk about, you know, since 2009 there hasn't been much activity.

1942
02:33:40,632 --> 02:33:41,772
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, there's been a lot of activity.

1943
02:33:41,792 --> 02:33:47,354
[SPEAKER_21]: We've met with consultants, but we also, everyone on this rail knows, we've been through a very difficult time.

1944
02:33:48,014 --> 02:33:50,535
[SPEAKER_21]: The whole nation's been through a difficult time economic wise.

1945
02:33:51,155 --> 02:33:52,475
[SPEAKER_21]: We haven't been able to hire people.

1946
02:33:52,495 --> 02:33:56,176
[SPEAKER_21]: We're just starting to hire people or replace vacancies.

1947
02:33:56,557 --> 02:33:59,397
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd just like to finish, so I can finish my train of thought.

1948
02:33:59,477 --> 02:34:03,158
[SPEAKER_21]: The idea is that there was always a more important issue.

1949
02:34:03,198 --> 02:34:08,760
[SPEAKER_21]: Just like I said, with priorities for the police as far as enforcement, there's always a more important issue than parking enforcement.

1950
02:34:09,390 --> 02:34:15,252
[SPEAKER_21]: There's been more important issues that confronted the city than having this parking management plan, but now it's time.

1951
02:34:16,452 --> 02:34:18,593
[SPEAKER_21]: We've put it on the back burner for long enough.

1952
02:34:18,653 --> 02:34:19,893
[SPEAKER_21]: Now it's time to move forward.

1953
02:34:21,034 --> 02:34:27,335
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to have some difficulties, but so far I've been very surprised at how quickly we've been able to resolve some of the issues that have popped up.

1954
02:34:28,296 --> 02:34:36,718
[SPEAKER_21]: If I've heard for years, and I know it's true with the economic downturn, businesses were suffering and businesses weren't going to survive.

1955
02:34:37,118 --> 02:34:39,079
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, if you couldn't survive with free parking,

1956
02:34:39,724 --> 02:34:43,245
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, now we're trying to generate some parking turnover.

1957
02:34:44,386 --> 02:34:48,948
[SPEAKER_21]: So people will come to businesses in the square or all the squares, the business districts.

1958
02:34:49,288 --> 02:35:04,134
[SPEAKER_21]: And as I said two weeks ago, yes, the contract call for certain amount of kiosks and certain amount of meters, some areas that did not receive them in this round, this program is built to expand if it proves successful.

1959
02:35:04,634 --> 02:35:07,655
[SPEAKER_21]: So those other areas that people are concerned about that didn't get meted,

1960
02:35:08,695 --> 02:35:10,617
[SPEAKER_21]: may very well see them in another year or two.

1961
02:35:11,197 --> 02:35:18,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, in all fairness, to this council especially, Hank Philippi Ryan came to this community and did an expose on its Channel 7.

1962
02:35:18,743 --> 02:35:24,708
[SPEAKER_14]: And they talked to the mayor, and the mayor was asked a question about the non-enforcement up in the metro area.

1963
02:35:25,753 --> 02:35:27,716
[SPEAKER_14]: for people parking there, and they did it for a month.

1964
02:35:27,776 --> 02:35:30,180
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't a day, a month, the same people, no enforcement.

1965
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:33,605
[SPEAKER_14]: And the mayor had the audacity to blame the city council for not giving the money.

1966
02:35:33,645 --> 02:35:35,087
[SPEAKER_14]: That was absolutely not true.

1967
02:35:35,347 --> 02:35:40,535
[SPEAKER_14]: This Memphis City Council has been most supportive of the police department and the fire department on every one of those issues.

1968
02:35:41,035 --> 02:35:48,219
[SPEAKER_14]: So taking that and coming forward, you have a tax bill, you have a water bill, you have an excise, you have a meals tax, and you're having business people that are trying to survive.

1969
02:35:48,499 --> 02:35:59,144
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a man that's never owned a business, doesn't know what it means to wake up in the morning, open the door, turn the key, gas, electric, employment, workman's comp, insurance, renter's insurance, trucks.

1970
02:36:00,645 --> 02:36:01,766
[SPEAKER_14]: You put, you, you, you.

1971
02:36:04,787 --> 02:36:08,871
[SPEAKER_14]: You put all that together, then you'll have an understanding.

1972
02:36:09,331 --> 02:36:12,854
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll have an understanding what the small little business man has to go through.

1973
02:36:12,874 --> 02:36:14,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Believe me.

1974
02:36:15,016 --> 02:36:17,818
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't speak for the mayor, but I will in this one point.

1975
02:36:18,258 --> 02:36:22,242
[SPEAKER_21]: He's the last person that wants to see anyone go out of business or an empty storefront.

1976
02:36:22,262 --> 02:36:23,302
[SPEAKER_21]: He's doing a good job of it.

1977
02:36:23,342 --> 02:36:24,223
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll tell you that.

1978
02:36:24,603 --> 02:36:25,784
[SPEAKER_21]: That's one thing for sure.

1979
02:36:25,864 --> 02:36:30,508
[SPEAKER_21]: No one wants to see an empty business or an empty storefront and someone suffer any more than they have to.

1980
02:36:30,528 --> 02:36:32,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember a few years ago?

1981
02:36:32,450 --> 02:36:33,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Counselor Penta.

1982
02:36:34,347 --> 02:36:53,797
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, on Riverside Avenue, when they shut down Riverside Avenue for the Ring Road, you put 39 businesses out because you took their front door visibility away, people that were here for years and years and years, and now what you're going to do is tell the small businessmen we're going to go to having a revenue enhancement rather than a traffic enforcement program.

1983
02:36:54,157 --> 02:36:56,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Start it small, see where it takes you.

1984
02:36:56,778 --> 02:37:02,441
[SPEAKER_21]: All I know is when they closed Riverside Avenue for that mall that they put in, that was the standard that was going on around the country.

1985
02:37:02,941 --> 02:37:04,463
[SPEAKER_21]: Try to emulate the Meadow Glen Mall.

1986
02:37:04,703 --> 02:37:09,328
[SPEAKER_21]: That is what hurt a lot of the businesses back in that day, back in the early 80s.

1987
02:37:09,448 --> 02:37:14,734
[SPEAKER_21]: And now look, Meadow Glen Mall is not doing so well.

1988
02:37:14,754 --> 02:37:15,615
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Counselor.

1989
02:37:16,056 --> 02:37:17,277
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Chief.

1990
02:37:17,918 --> 02:37:22,363
[SPEAKER_24]: Whoever was next in line, if you could, ma'am, state your name and address for the record.

1991
02:37:31,140 --> 02:37:36,204
[SPEAKER_12]: My question is, I just want to find out the 50-minute parking we have over there.

1992
02:37:36,984 --> 02:37:42,648
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to stay the 50 minutes because the two gentlemen that were there yesterday and today, they made a pay.

1993
02:37:43,565 --> 02:37:44,946
[SPEAKER_12]: for the court is other people.

1994
02:37:45,026 --> 02:37:46,927
[SPEAKER_12]: They came in my store and any other store.

1995
02:37:47,887 --> 02:37:53,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Just I'd like to know, are we going to leave it at 50 minutes, or they have to pay?

1996
02:37:53,791 --> 02:37:55,412
[SPEAKER_24]: The chief will answer your question.

1997
02:37:56,832 --> 02:37:57,853
[SPEAKER_12]: God bless the chief.

1998
02:37:59,814 --> 02:38:00,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1999
02:38:00,294 --> 02:38:04,477
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, those spots are staying for 15 minutes, and they're free.

2000
02:38:05,077 --> 02:38:05,937
[SPEAKER_21]: But they're 15 minutes.

2001
02:38:05,998 --> 02:38:06,998
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, that's fine.

2002
02:38:07,038 --> 02:38:08,379
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to enforce that too?

2003
02:38:08,559 --> 02:38:08,799
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2004
02:38:09,539 --> 02:38:10,440
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, thank you very much.

2005
02:38:10,926 --> 02:38:12,768
[SPEAKER_12]: There's another question I want to ask.

2006
02:38:13,108 --> 02:38:14,449
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand it too much.

2007
02:38:14,549 --> 02:38:27,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Mr. Pender just say, if the business owner, the one that they got a restaurant or whatever, and they want to get that five spot for the whole night, they can do that or every two hours we have to move?

2008
02:38:27,519 --> 02:38:27,900
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2009
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:30,201
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand that question.

2010
02:38:30,222 --> 02:38:33,724
[SPEAKER_12]: You just say two hours they have to move.

2011
02:38:33,964 --> 02:38:34,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2012
02:38:34,865 --> 02:38:35,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2013
02:38:35,306 --> 02:38:36,326
[SPEAKER_12]: That was my question.

2014
02:38:36,727 --> 02:38:37,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

2015
02:38:37,607 --> 02:38:38,188
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2016
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:43,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street.

2017
02:38:44,861 --> 02:38:50,603
[SPEAKER_05]: In reference to a point you made about a fee, I paid by a debit card for my application.

2018
02:38:51,423 --> 02:38:52,783
[SPEAKER_05]: A debit card is cash and cash.

2019
02:38:52,803 --> 02:38:55,544
[SPEAKER_05]: There's usually no transaction fee associated with that.

2020
02:38:56,325 --> 02:39:02,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my bank statement, and on my bank statement it said, from Republic Parking, citation fee.

2021
02:39:02,887 --> 02:39:06,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Now why would an administration fee be called a citation fee?

2022
02:39:06,608 --> 02:39:07,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are two different words.

2023
02:39:08,742 --> 02:39:15,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to say that that administration fee is called the citation fee to say, this is the revenue we did in the first month.

2024
02:39:16,323 --> 02:39:18,984
[SPEAKER_05]: How many, how many permit parking placards do we have?

2025
02:39:19,804 --> 02:39:20,784
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a thousand in the city.

2026
02:39:20,804 --> 02:39:23,665
[SPEAKER_05]: That's $3,000 is a citation fee.

2027
02:39:24,125 --> 02:39:31,526
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is chief, what about resident permit parking enforcement after seven o'clock?

2028
02:39:31,626 --> 02:39:32,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's going to be responsible for that?

2029
02:39:35,847 --> 02:39:36,427
[SPEAKER_21]: And who do we call?

2030
02:39:37,845 --> 02:39:38,885
[SPEAKER_21]: you call the Medford police.

2031
02:39:39,405 --> 02:39:52,948
[SPEAKER_21]: We will be doing enforcement after hours, but I've been assured by the Republic folks that in the very beginning of this program, and I believe it will begin in January 26th, we will be putting out some messages ahead of time to the various permit parking streets.

2032
02:39:53,088 --> 02:40:03,850
[SPEAKER_21]: So that the reminder notice to remind them to get going, to get their permits and that it will be going live on January 26th, I believe is the date.

2033
02:40:04,630 --> 02:40:05,270
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, but,

2034
02:40:06,350 --> 02:40:20,016
[SPEAKER_21]: They will be staggering their personnel so that they can cover the evening and hopefully into maybe the early morning hours, because I know that many of the residents in the past, Yale Street, the Hillside, Tufts neighborhoods, they're very disappointed on the overnight.

2035
02:40:20,036 --> 02:40:30,960
[SPEAKER_21]: When they get up in the morning and come out and see all the out-of-state plates or cars that are not registered to their street, they're gonna get up, they're gonna find a lot of orange tickets under the windshield wipers of those vehicles.

2036
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:35,822
[SPEAKER_21]: But speaking with the mayor today and with others, I mean, we will be,

2037
02:40:36,661 --> 02:40:38,242
[SPEAKER_21]: purchasing the technology as well.

2038
02:40:38,302 --> 02:40:44,507
[SPEAKER_21]: So our crews will be able to go up and down the street to read the plates that will turn around and tell us whether they're registered for that street or not.

2039
02:40:44,547 --> 02:40:50,711
[SPEAKER_21]: But the Medford police is still the police department in the city that will still be responsible for enforcement.

2040
02:40:51,151 --> 02:41:02,379
[SPEAKER_21]: We are now sharing that responsibility with Republic parking and they're going to help us out tremendously because we still don't have enough personnel to handle every section of the city all the time.

2041
02:41:03,080 --> 02:41:04,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Just another question.

2042
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:05,041
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of clarification.

2043
02:41:05,101 --> 02:41:06,242
[SPEAKER_24]: Counsel Lungo Kern.

2044
02:41:07,097 --> 02:41:08,818
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Del Rosso.

2045
02:41:08,858 --> 02:41:17,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Just while you're on that go-live date for the permit parking, is that scheduled to be the go-live date for the whole program, kiosks included?

2046
02:41:17,543 --> 02:41:20,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Meters and kiosks would be January 15th, I believe.

2047
02:41:21,586 --> 02:41:23,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of order on that question.

2048
02:41:25,288 --> 02:41:27,990
[SPEAKER_14]: On that question today in South Medford, I got a phone call from a business person.

2049
02:41:28,330 --> 02:41:31,472
[SPEAKER_14]: The people from Republic were there telling people that they had to put the money in the meter.

2050
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:34,421
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, what is it, the 5th, the 15th?

2051
02:41:35,482 --> 02:41:37,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is Republic here?

2052
02:41:37,303 --> 02:41:39,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are your people telling people to put the money in the meter?

2053
02:41:41,406 --> 02:41:43,387
[SPEAKER_27]: The meters are active as of the 5th.

2054
02:41:44,287 --> 02:41:47,309
[SPEAKER_27]: Enforcement on the meters will begin mid-month on the 15th.

2055
02:41:47,329 --> 02:41:48,330
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're taking money in the meter.

2056
02:41:48,350 --> 02:41:49,090
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what you're doing.

2057
02:41:49,491 --> 02:41:51,692
[SPEAKER_27]: We're collecting money on behalf of the city.

2058
02:41:51,792 --> 02:41:54,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, if it doesn't start till the 15th, what are you collecting it on the 5th for?

2059
02:41:55,014 --> 02:41:55,394
[SPEAKER_27]: No, sir.

2060
02:41:55,714 --> 02:41:57,896
[SPEAKER_27]: I said enforcement begins on the 15th.

2061
02:41:58,176 --> 02:41:58,776
[SPEAKER_14]: What'd you say?

2062
02:41:59,136 --> 02:41:59,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Enforcement.

2063
02:42:00,628 --> 02:42:02,950
[SPEAKER_27]: The meters are active in collecting parking revenue for the city.

2064
02:42:02,970 --> 02:42:03,691
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not fair.

2065
02:42:03,711 --> 02:42:04,591
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you talking about?

2066
02:42:04,631 --> 02:42:06,253
[SPEAKER_14]: You're taking people's money now.

2067
02:42:06,313 --> 02:42:09,295
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're having 10 days of free money before you even do any enforcement.

2068
02:42:10,256 --> 02:42:11,357
[SPEAKER_14]: To learn how to use the system.

2069
02:42:11,397 --> 02:42:13,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

2070
02:42:14,460 --> 02:42:20,905
[SPEAKER_11]: This city council asked the mayor's office specifically to have a grace period on violations and enforcement.

2071
02:42:20,925 --> 02:42:22,546
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm assuming this is the grace period.

2072
02:42:23,948 --> 02:42:25,329
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a way to get it.

2073
02:42:25,369 --> 02:42:27,991
[SPEAKER_11]: We asked for at least a couple of weeks.

2074
02:42:28,011 --> 02:42:28,691
[SPEAKER_11]: We asked for a month.

2075
02:42:30,733 --> 02:42:32,814
[SPEAKER_27]: Is this considered the grace period on enforcement?

2076
02:42:32,835 --> 02:42:33,195
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.

2077
02:42:33,235 --> 02:42:38,158
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's obviously another way to get more information out to the people and make them aware of it, which it obviously has.

2078
02:42:46,324 --> 02:42:46,704
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2079
02:42:47,085 --> 02:42:48,085
Ma'am, you'd like to speak?

2080
02:42:49,666 --> 02:42:50,647
[SPEAKER_24]: She's chilled.

2081
02:42:55,711 --> 02:42:57,132
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Nick Tomazook.

2082
02:42:57,172 --> 02:42:58,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I live at 29 Garfield.

2083
02:42:59,724 --> 02:43:04,108
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we come here, and we squawk, and we hoot, and we howl.

2084
02:43:04,808 --> 02:43:06,349
[SPEAKER_07]: This monster's here to stay.

2085
02:43:07,791 --> 02:43:11,594
[SPEAKER_07]: The only ones that can change it is you guys can make it easier for the people in the city.

2086
02:43:11,734 --> 02:43:13,235
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the mayor's office.

2087
02:43:13,255 --> 02:43:14,616
[SPEAKER_07]: But this monster's here to stay.

2088
02:43:15,197 --> 02:43:15,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2089
02:43:15,477 --> 02:43:16,377
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for 10 years.

2090
02:43:17,098 --> 02:43:17,739
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's not us.

2091
02:43:17,759 --> 02:43:18,039
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't.

2092
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:24,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys got to start to listen to these citizens and try to make it as easy as we can.

2093
02:43:25,265 --> 02:43:29,188
[SPEAKER_07]: So this company doesn't build another high rise down in Atlanta.

2094
02:43:30,116 --> 02:43:31,237
[SPEAKER_07]: or wherever the hell they're from.

2095
02:43:31,797 --> 02:43:32,838
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not from Massachusetts.

2096
02:43:32,878 --> 02:43:35,760
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's all I got to say.

2097
02:43:35,860 --> 02:43:37,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for your time.

2098
02:43:37,221 --> 02:43:37,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2099
02:43:38,902 --> 02:43:40,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Ma'am, you'd like to speak?

2100
02:43:40,943 --> 02:43:41,044
Hi.

2101
02:43:41,664 --> 02:43:46,567
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Janice Marino, and I own Backstreet Salon, 370 Main Street, South Medford.

2102
02:43:47,328 --> 02:43:55,774
[SPEAKER_23]: And I have so much anxiety about this whole thing, because I have elderly clients that can't walk from one kiosk to another one to my shop.

2103
02:43:56,434 --> 02:43:59,156
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's going to make a disaster for me.

2104
02:44:00,072 --> 02:44:00,933
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm sick about it.

2105
02:44:02,033 --> 02:44:02,794
[SPEAKER_23]: So I don't know.

2106
02:44:02,894 --> 02:44:08,618
[SPEAKER_23]: I just hope that everybody could just do something for the elderly people.

2107
02:44:08,878 --> 02:44:12,360
[SPEAKER_23]: And I understand two hours is fine.

2108
02:44:12,420 --> 02:44:14,882
[SPEAKER_23]: But sometimes in a hair salon, it gets really busy.

2109
02:44:15,582 --> 02:44:18,484
[SPEAKER_23]: And it takes longer to do different services for people.

2110
02:44:18,745 --> 02:44:19,565
[SPEAKER_23]: And they need more.

2111
02:44:19,985 --> 02:44:29,632
[SPEAKER_23]: So what I was going to ask you is, if they have this kiosk, and they have to come out of the salon, and they have to move their car, they're not going to come anymore.

2112
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:31,270
[SPEAKER_23]: They're not going to come.

2113
02:44:31,291 --> 02:44:33,292
[SPEAKER_23]: They're going to say, I'm going someplace else.

2114
02:44:33,332 --> 02:44:36,674
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to go to assembly mall and have free parking.

2115
02:44:36,755 --> 02:44:39,136
[SPEAKER_23]: And why go to South Medford anymore?

2116
02:44:40,197 --> 02:44:43,019
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, so I'm, I'm so scared about losing my business.

2117
02:44:44,300 --> 02:44:45,341
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's all I have to say.

2118
02:44:45,701 --> 02:44:46,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Janice.

2119
02:44:50,705 --> 02:44:52,266
[SPEAKER_24]: Sir, you name an address for the record.

2120
02:44:52,652 --> 02:44:56,895
[SPEAKER_29]: My name is DJ Dabeningo, proprietor Dabs Lock 470 High Street, West Bedford.

2121
02:44:57,856 --> 02:45:06,963
[SPEAKER_29]: Uh, I was here two weeks ago, uh, this evening, like tonight addressing the council on this parking issue that is now a going to be a big issue in this city.

2122
02:45:07,884 --> 02:45:13,028
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, a couple of the concerns I addressed, um, and two weeks later still have no answers on one.

2123
02:45:13,048 --> 02:45:16,211
[SPEAKER_29]: And I heard earlier from home, sorry for my lateness.

2124
02:45:16,291 --> 02:45:19,113
[SPEAKER_29]: I, uh, suffered from a concussion earlier after falling on the ice and,

2125
02:45:19,705 --> 02:45:22,728
[SPEAKER_29]: was resting at home, so I had to rush down here to speak on this issue.

2126
02:45:23,569 --> 02:45:27,213
[SPEAKER_29]: One is the temporary parking passes for the business workers.

2127
02:45:28,114 --> 02:45:31,257
[SPEAKER_29]: I, like many businesses here in the city, employ

2128
02:45:33,449 --> 02:45:41,453
[SPEAKER_29]: individuals who work on a part-time basis who I cannot justify buying them a business parking permit for the year.

2129
02:45:42,553 --> 02:45:45,715
[SPEAKER_29]: One of my workers comes in four hours a week, one day a week.

2130
02:45:45,855 --> 02:45:56,540
[SPEAKER_29]: This past Monday, yesterday, I told him to stay home because I had been told that the enforcement was starting yesterday and I was not going to buy his vehicle a parking permit.

2131
02:45:57,400 --> 02:46:01,681
[SPEAKER_29]: And I have since told my other worker to stay home until we can figure this out.

2132
02:46:03,342 --> 02:46:16,925
[SPEAKER_29]: I went down to the Republic office yesterday in South Medford to buy my business permit, which I was always doing, and was listening to the frustrations of the residents in line who were buying their residential permits.

2133
02:46:17,485 --> 02:46:23,547
[SPEAKER_29]: When they approached the counter, they were told, it's $10 for the year, and then you get two visitor placards by year.

2134
02:46:24,447 --> 02:46:27,728
[SPEAKER_29]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm paying $100 a year, and I got zilch.

2135
02:46:28,848 --> 02:46:39,190
[SPEAKER_29]: All I'm asking is some considerations be given to those businesses who employ more than one employee and give us something to work with.

2136
02:46:39,490 --> 02:46:42,971
[SPEAKER_29]: Because at the end of my lease, all I'm going to do is say, you know what, Medford?

2137
02:46:43,571 --> 02:46:44,151
[SPEAKER_29]: Sayonara.

2138
02:46:45,211 --> 02:46:50,792
[SPEAKER_29]: A few years ago, and I reiterate, quote unquote, the mayor stated the small businesses are the backbone of this community.

2139
02:46:51,152 --> 02:46:53,933
[SPEAKER_29]: How are they the backbone of this community if you're trying to force us out?

2140
02:46:55,175 --> 02:46:56,116
[SPEAKER_29]: That's my first issue.

2141
02:46:56,176 --> 02:46:59,898
[SPEAKER_29]: Second issue is there's a small issue of what I'm calling discrimination.

2142
02:47:00,579 --> 02:47:06,543
[SPEAKER_29]: So in West Medford, where I am, you have a lock shop, you have a dog groomer, and you have a convenience store and some place to eat.

2143
02:47:07,103 --> 02:47:10,205
[SPEAKER_29]: Down on Salem Street, in between Paris and

2144
02:47:11,485 --> 02:47:13,605
[SPEAKER_29]: park, you have the same types of stores.

2145
02:47:13,645 --> 02:47:16,906
[SPEAKER_29]: You have a lock shop, a dog room, or someplace to eat, and a convenience store.

2146
02:47:17,546 --> 02:47:20,787
[SPEAKER_29]: The only difference between those two areas and West Medford, you have to pay to park.

2147
02:47:21,107 --> 02:47:22,087
[SPEAKER_29]: In that strip, you don't.

2148
02:47:22,467 --> 02:47:27,888
[SPEAKER_29]: They are still businesses paying business taxes like I am, but their customers can park all day for free.

2149
02:47:28,528 --> 02:47:30,829
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's what's really irritating me about this.

2150
02:47:31,429 --> 02:47:36,970
[SPEAKER_29]: And any time I ask anyone with the city, including Republic, about answers, all I said is, we don't know.

2151
02:47:37,030 --> 02:47:37,790
[SPEAKER_29]: We scratch our heads.

2152
02:47:38,670 --> 02:47:40,611
[SPEAKER_29]: So I leave you with that tonight.

2153
02:47:40,731 --> 02:47:42,131
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you again for allowing me to speak.

2154
02:47:42,191 --> 02:47:45,952
[SPEAKER_29]: Congratulations to our new president and vice president on the council here.

2155
02:47:46,352 --> 02:47:46,812
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2156
02:47:46,852 --> 02:47:47,212
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2157
02:47:52,754 --> 02:47:53,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

2158
02:47:53,334 --> 02:47:55,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2159
02:47:55,095 --> 02:47:55,795
[SPEAKER_31]: Certainly.

2160
02:47:56,275 --> 02:47:59,996
[SPEAKER_31]: Andrew Castanetti, 23 Cushman street, Medford, Massachusetts.

2161
02:48:00,016 --> 02:48:01,316
[SPEAKER_31]: Congratulations.

2162
02:48:01,376 --> 02:48:04,077
[SPEAKER_31]: Council president and council vice president.

2163
02:48:07,001 --> 02:48:11,983
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm no politician, as you can tell by my choice of words or lack of choice of words thereof.

2164
02:48:13,583 --> 02:48:15,744
[SPEAKER_31]: Therefore, I call it the way I see it.

2165
02:48:18,465 --> 02:48:24,247
[SPEAKER_31]: First off, it's very encouraging for a change to see all these people get civically involved.

2166
02:48:24,267 --> 02:48:32,290
[SPEAKER_31]: I wish they were here for my residential real estate exemption last month.

2167
02:48:34,211 --> 02:48:34,591
[SPEAKER_31]: Number two.

2168
02:48:36,704 --> 02:48:40,266
[SPEAKER_31]: Once upon a time, Meffitt Square did have parking meters.

2169
02:48:41,567 --> 02:48:44,368
[SPEAKER_31]: I believe when I was a teenager, they were there.

2170
02:48:46,750 --> 02:48:53,233
[SPEAKER_31]: Number three, then the meters were removed and replaced with two-hour free parking signs.

2171
02:48:54,274 --> 02:49:01,157
[SPEAKER_31]: However, for whatever reason or reasons, the two-hour limit was not consistently enforced.

2172
02:49:02,458 --> 02:49:05,840
[SPEAKER_31]: And then number four, the parking

2173
02:49:06,735 --> 02:49:09,716
[SPEAKER_31]: became abused from within and from without.

2174
02:49:10,236 --> 02:49:16,759
[SPEAKER_31]: Out-of-towners taking the bus or the train into Boston or wherever.

2175
02:49:18,379 --> 02:49:27,062
[SPEAKER_31]: Also, I believe most business owners want constant turnover for customer parking.

2176
02:49:28,903 --> 02:49:32,044
[SPEAKER_31]: And six, and now the free parking party is over,

2177
02:49:32,835 --> 02:49:41,179
[SPEAKER_31]: and we all must pay as we go or stop to park.

2178
02:49:43,741 --> 02:49:48,403
[SPEAKER_31]: Seems that the valid contract is signed, right or wrong?

2179
02:49:51,445 --> 02:49:51,785
[SPEAKER_31]: Good luck.

2180
02:49:55,147 --> 02:49:55,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2181
02:49:55,547 --> 02:49:57,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Sir, could you please state your name and address for the record?

2182
02:49:57,968 --> 02:49:58,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Council President.

2183
02:49:58,829 --> 02:50:00,910
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

2184
02:50:01,290 --> 02:50:19,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at Dunkin' Donuts on Sunday, and I'm sitting in the window reading my paper at the crosswalk, and the crosswalk is all broken, seriously damaged, so if someone is walking on it, a woman with her high heels could fall easily, and then the crosswalk is faded.

2185
02:50:19,281 --> 02:50:21,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you go a little further down, and

2186
02:50:22,429 --> 02:50:27,553
[SPEAKER_10]: At the coin-operated laundry, the gutter, you could get your tire in that rut.

2187
02:50:27,593 --> 02:50:28,154
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so big.

2188
02:50:28,554 --> 02:50:31,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, this problem is across Medford.

2189
02:50:31,777 --> 02:50:37,542
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is, how much money is Republic going to make from this compared to Medford?

2190
02:50:37,562 --> 02:50:39,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they going to get 75% and we 25?

2191
02:50:39,904 --> 02:50:41,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they going to get 99% and us 1?

2192
02:50:42,766 --> 02:50:43,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to get 100%?

2193
02:50:44,027 --> 02:50:44,448
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2194
02:50:44,488 --> 02:50:50,573
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we're paying to park in this city and the streets are broken, we're getting a bill of goods here because

2195
02:50:51,788 --> 02:50:58,351
[SPEAKER_10]: We're paying for premium space in what, I mean, Salem Street, Haines Square is starting to look like a third world country.

2196
02:50:58,371 --> 02:51:00,252
[SPEAKER_10]: The litter is beyond control.

2197
02:51:00,733 --> 02:51:11,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see it in other communities, not in Woburn, not in Winchester, not in Stoneham, but here in Medford where I live, I'm constantly picking stuff up in front of my house, which blows in from the gas station, constantly.

2198
02:51:12,258 --> 02:51:15,340
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have this litter and these broken streets.

2199
02:51:16,605 --> 02:51:21,126
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor's been in office for 28 years, and Republic has been in business a long time.

2200
02:51:21,986 --> 02:51:26,827
[SPEAKER_10]: They're as efficient, and I'm not making a joke here, they're as efficient as the machines in the film The Matrix.

2201
02:51:26,947 --> 02:51:27,828
[SPEAKER_10]: They know what they're doing.

2202
02:51:28,548 --> 02:51:30,008
[SPEAKER_10]: They're very, very smart.

2203
02:51:31,248 --> 02:51:38,150
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't want us to have this on a public access station, which, by the way, we don't have anyways, but if we did, we would have had a discussion.

2204
02:51:39,066 --> 02:51:42,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to thank Mayor D'Antonio for actually bringing the people out tonight.

2205
02:51:42,368 --> 02:51:43,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's put it where it is.

2206
02:51:44,029 --> 02:51:48,491
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy that ran for mayor is the guy doing the real heavy lifting here.

2207
02:51:48,891 --> 02:51:51,572
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Anthony, for doing the hard work and bringing people out.

2208
02:51:52,773 --> 02:51:55,534
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know about the street, and can we fix them?

2209
02:51:56,135 --> 02:51:59,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to get money, serious money, to fix and pave our streets?

2210
02:51:59,696 --> 02:52:00,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're a mess.

2211
02:52:00,417 --> 02:52:02,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Garfield Ave is pothole central.

2212
02:52:03,314 --> 02:52:06,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Central Ave took a long time to fix, and I know it's late.

2213
02:52:06,677 --> 02:52:10,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Locust Ave finally got fixed, but it's a little too late.

2214
02:52:11,481 --> 02:52:19,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to know, Republic, if you can tell us what kind of breakdown the city's going to make from this revenue enhancement program.

2215
02:52:30,659 --> 02:52:34,782
[SPEAKER_27]: The contract with Republic in the city is a shared revenue contract.

2216
02:52:35,502 --> 02:52:47,330
[SPEAKER_27]: Republic Parking is responsible for all of the capital investment, the kiosks and the vehicles and all of the labor and all of the technology that's required, the office rent and such and overhead that we have as a business.

2217
02:52:48,050 --> 02:52:55,975
[SPEAKER_27]: And the revenues that will actually be earned will be determined by the results of the program, the amount of money that's generated from the program itself.

2218
02:52:56,616 --> 02:53:00,018
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's based on a percentage of the actual revenues that are received.

2219
02:53:04,157 --> 02:53:14,005
[SPEAKER_27]: There is a threshold, but basically the top threshold is 83% goes to the city and 17% goes to Republic out of which we have to pay all of our expenses.

2220
02:53:18,609 --> 02:53:19,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information.

2221
02:53:19,690 --> 02:53:20,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Camuso.

2222
02:53:20,991 --> 02:53:21,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2223
02:53:21,711 --> 02:53:24,594
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, a portion of that too,

2224
02:53:25,351 --> 02:53:31,354
[SPEAKER_11]: set up by this council and the administration is earmarked to go right back into community development in the squares.

2225
02:53:32,175 --> 02:53:42,360
[SPEAKER_11]: So whether it's hiring a consultant to try to bring in more business, whatever the case, whether it's physical infrastructure improvements of a particular square.

2226
02:53:42,781 --> 02:53:52,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So this council, working with the solicitor's office and the mayor's office, we're adamant that a portion of this does go back to the business districts that are affected.

2227
02:53:53,166 --> 02:53:54,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, councillor.

2228
02:53:55,011 --> 02:53:56,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Pinto, did you have a point of information?

2229
02:53:56,652 --> 02:54:03,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Jack, I think, excuse me, Mr. Skelton, I think you indicated when you folks were here that you folks needed to do approximately $2 million a year in business?

2230
02:54:05,575 --> 02:54:08,216
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the projections that were working off of, yes.

2231
02:54:08,577 --> 02:54:09,837
[SPEAKER_14]: You needed $2 million a year.

2232
02:54:10,417 --> 02:54:13,359
[SPEAKER_14]: And the city gets, after the first year, the city gets $300,000.

2233
02:54:14,319 --> 02:54:19,021
[SPEAKER_14]: And then after the second year, the city gets $700,000, going up to the seventh year.

2234
02:54:19,041 --> 02:54:21,702
[SPEAKER_14]: And then years eight, nine, and 10, it's a renegotiable too.

2235
02:54:22,122 --> 02:54:31,152
[SPEAKER_14]: So if the city goes from $300,000 to $700,000, that's a $400,000 jump in one year, how much do you folks expect to make between the first and the second year?

2236
02:54:31,792 --> 02:54:34,295
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, it depends on the amount of revenue generated.

2237
02:54:37,053 --> 02:54:39,855
[SPEAKER_27]: Referencing there is the guaranteed portion of the contract.

2238
02:54:39,975 --> 02:54:40,395
[SPEAKER_27]: Guaranteed.

2239
02:54:40,595 --> 02:54:41,756
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the guaranteed number.

2240
02:54:42,356 --> 02:54:45,598
[SPEAKER_27]: The threshold percentage breakdown is above that, sir.

2241
02:54:45,798 --> 02:54:52,542
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we're guaranteed a minimum of 300,000 the first year, because you have to do the cost for the kiosks and everything else.

2242
02:54:52,862 --> 02:54:53,923
[SPEAKER_14]: And the second year it jumps up 400,000.

2243
02:54:54,643 --> 02:54:59,906
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's like 110% increase to the city, if not more.

2244
02:55:00,667 --> 02:55:02,588
[SPEAKER_27]: If we meet the thresholds.

2245
02:55:02,848 --> 02:55:04,609
[SPEAKER_14]: So if the thresholds are not met,

2246
02:55:05,720 --> 02:55:09,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that an allowance for the city to opt out of the contract likewise with you?

2247
02:55:09,702 --> 02:55:12,564
[SPEAKER_14]: The city has the option to terminate the contract at any time.

2248
02:55:12,904 --> 02:55:13,325
[SPEAKER_27]: At any time?

2249
02:55:13,565 --> 02:55:13,865
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.

2250
02:55:15,246 --> 02:55:16,607
[SPEAKER_27]: No penalty, or what the penalty?

2251
02:55:17,187 --> 02:55:20,789
[SPEAKER_27]: They would have to pay off the investment that was made in the parking program.

2252
02:55:20,989 --> 02:55:24,011
[SPEAKER_14]: And how much is the investment right now, so far, approximately?

2253
02:55:24,812 --> 02:55:25,132
[SPEAKER_14]: About $800,000.

2254
02:55:25,532 --> 02:55:25,732
[SPEAKER_14]: About $800,000?

2255
02:55:25,772 --> 02:55:25,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2256
02:55:25,892 --> 02:55:27,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, $800,000, that's for the cost of what, the kiosks and the signs?

2257
02:55:27,653 --> 02:55:27,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2258
02:55:35,815 --> 02:55:36,781
[SPEAKER_14]: all of the technology.

2259
02:55:36,801 --> 02:55:38,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, all the technology and the science.

2260
02:55:40,859 --> 02:55:43,261
[SPEAKER_14]: this supposedly 10 year deal.

2261
02:55:43,661 --> 02:55:45,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this a rather long- Yeah, well, no, it is.

2262
02:55:45,522 --> 02:55:47,804
[SPEAKER_14]: It's relative to the money part of what he was talking about.

2263
02:55:48,164 --> 02:55:49,645
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a corollary, you know what those are?

2264
02:55:49,665 --> 02:55:50,886
[SPEAKER_14]: The corollaries go like this.

2265
02:55:51,327 --> 02:55:54,069
[SPEAKER_14]: The commentary was- It sounds like a run on sentence, councillor.

2266
02:55:54,209 --> 02:55:57,831
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an $18 million contract, but it's not $18 million for the city of Medford.

2267
02:55:57,851 --> 02:56:01,894
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an $18 million contract between you and the city and the city of Medford comes out of this.

2268
02:56:02,134 --> 02:56:07,038
[SPEAKER_14]: If we follow just your projections, if everything is met to $7.9 million, not $18 million as reported.

2269
02:56:11,476 --> 02:56:23,002
[SPEAKER_14]: If I understand that correctly, a guarantee of $300 the first year, $700 the next year, if everything is met for the next seven years, figure that out for the 10-year of the contract, it's $7.9 million, not $18 million.

2270
02:56:23,402 --> 02:56:26,123
[SPEAKER_27]: The number you're quoting is not something that we provided.

2271
02:56:26,223 --> 02:56:28,544
[SPEAKER_27]: That was an overall revenue projection.

2272
02:56:28,844 --> 02:56:30,925
[SPEAKER_14]: But the revenue projection doesn't come to the city.

2273
02:56:32,286 --> 02:56:34,847
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're getting $7.9, you're getting at least that, if not more.

2274
02:56:35,347 --> 02:56:35,768
[SPEAKER_27]: No, sir.

2275
02:56:36,028 --> 02:56:37,328
[SPEAKER_27]: I sure wish that was the case.

2276
02:56:37,689 --> 02:56:40,630
[SPEAKER_27]: We're obligated for all the operating expenses, which are significant.

2277
02:56:41,601 --> 02:56:56,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think maybe the city should really deeply investigate the fact that if we are locked into this for at least one year, we have an option to maybe look at this and maybe get out of it because I, you know, to be honest with you, that's an awful lot of money for you guys to think you're going to generate $2 million a year.

2278
02:56:57,678 --> 02:57:03,044
[SPEAKER_14]: And the $2 million a year just might not happen if people figure out, listen, I'm not going to go there and spend this money in the computer.

2279
02:57:03,304 --> 02:57:04,285
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, in the kiosk,

2280
02:57:04,686 --> 02:57:08,189
[SPEAKER_14]: As Councilor Knight has alluded to, why am I supposed to spend 35 cents to put a quarter into the meter?

2281
02:57:08,510 --> 02:57:09,731
[SPEAKER_14]: That's another screwy thing.

2282
02:57:09,931 --> 02:57:18,720
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you have a validation program, that's only going to hit certain people to the exclusion of other, which is discriminatory as far as I'm concerned, every single business needs to be treated the same.

2283
02:57:18,980 --> 02:57:22,083
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they're not going to be treated the same, then the program can never work with equity.

2284
02:57:25,206 --> 02:57:26,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

2285
02:57:27,188 --> 02:57:28,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caraviello.

2286
02:57:28,870 --> 02:57:29,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2287
02:57:30,201 --> 02:57:37,384
[SPEAKER_16]: While you're here, can you explain how you're going to go around and tag these cars and not tag them?

2288
02:57:37,404 --> 02:57:38,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you going to monitor this?

2289
02:57:39,105 --> 02:57:39,685
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm confused.

2290
02:57:39,985 --> 02:57:41,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there going to be people?

2291
02:57:41,466 --> 02:57:43,787
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hearing that you're going to have two cars going around the city.

2292
02:57:44,227 --> 02:57:50,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there going to be people actually in West Medford, Method Square, actually doing things?

2293
02:57:51,330 --> 02:57:51,510
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

2294
02:57:52,030 --> 02:57:54,551
[SPEAKER_27]: All citations will be issued by our employees.

2295
02:57:54,891 --> 02:57:55,231
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no.

2296
02:57:55,251 --> 02:57:55,631
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not that.

2297
02:57:56,732 --> 02:57:59,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there going to be a person walking around Method Square

2298
02:58:00,036 --> 02:58:02,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you doing this all via the vehicle?

2299
02:58:02,577 --> 02:58:07,398
[SPEAKER_27]: There will be a combination of vehicle patrols and foot patrols, but primarily vehicle patrols.

2300
02:58:07,858 --> 02:58:11,339
[SPEAKER_27]: And that allows us to be very efficient and numbers.

2301
02:58:12,200 --> 02:58:14,881
[SPEAKER_27]: How many vehicles are going to be circling the city?

2302
02:58:14,901 --> 02:58:18,882
[SPEAKER_27]: We have two LPR vehicles that will be utilized for the program.

2303
02:58:20,682 --> 02:58:21,823
[SPEAKER_27]: So two vehicles?

2304
02:58:22,863 --> 02:58:23,163
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.

2305
02:58:23,283 --> 02:58:24,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Can do permit parking?

2306
02:58:25,824 --> 02:58:26,184
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.

2307
02:58:26,224 --> 02:58:26,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Parking?

2308
02:58:28,925 --> 02:58:29,205
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.

2309
02:58:30,650 --> 02:58:34,152
[SPEAKER_27]: We have as a correlation, as a comparison in other cities.

2310
02:58:34,232 --> 02:58:35,333
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're going to be driving.

2311
02:58:35,673 --> 02:58:37,434
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's going to give out the citation in the car?

2312
02:58:37,474 --> 02:58:40,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the gentleman or lady going to get out of the car and put a ticket on the window?

2313
02:58:41,356 --> 02:58:41,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2314
02:58:41,556 --> 02:58:43,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Or are they going to put their hand on it?

2315
02:58:43,277 --> 02:58:44,178
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, that's correct.

2316
02:58:44,378 --> 02:58:47,079
[SPEAKER_27]: All the tickets will be placed on the vehicle by our officer.

2317
02:58:47,460 --> 02:58:49,021
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a commonly used practice.

2318
02:58:49,201 --> 02:58:50,421
[SPEAKER_27]: That'll be in the vehicle, correct?

2319
02:58:51,202 --> 02:58:52,342
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, they're in the vehicle.

2320
02:58:52,422 --> 02:58:56,785
[SPEAKER_27]: They'll make the identification of a violation and then get out of the vehicle and issue the citation.

2321
02:58:57,127 --> 02:58:59,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Now who's gonna monitor if there's a handicapped placard in the window?

2322
02:59:00,189 --> 02:59:03,531
[SPEAKER_16]: That will be our officers as well as the police department.

2323
02:59:03,551 --> 02:59:08,214
[SPEAKER_16]: So before you give a ticket to my car, you know, look to make sure there's not a handicapped placard in the window?

2324
02:59:08,475 --> 02:59:08,835
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.

2325
02:59:09,175 --> 02:59:10,036
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2326
02:59:10,476 --> 02:59:11,116
[SPEAKER_16]: What about towing?

2327
02:59:11,136 --> 02:59:13,238
[SPEAKER_27]: Are any of these guys ever gonna be towed?

2328
02:59:14,719 --> 02:59:17,881
[SPEAKER_27]: Under the current ordinances, a scoff law is eligible for towing.

2329
02:59:18,421 --> 02:59:20,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Who makes the decision on who gets towed?

2330
02:59:20,663 --> 02:59:21,724
[SPEAKER_16]: That's by ordinance.

2331
02:59:23,104 --> 02:59:23,365
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, so,

2332
02:59:25,100 --> 02:59:31,943
[SPEAKER_16]: If you drive by the same car that's been there for two or three days, you call the police department and say, this guy's been there, we should have a toad.

2333
02:59:32,003 --> 02:59:33,524
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, who makes that decision who gets toad?

2334
02:59:34,764 --> 02:59:37,125
[SPEAKER_27]: It's authorized through the police department to make a toad.

2335
02:59:37,145 --> 02:59:37,766
[SPEAKER_27]: So the police department's?

2336
02:59:38,146 --> 02:59:38,346
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.

2337
02:59:38,666 --> 02:59:40,247
[SPEAKER_27]: By current ordinance, that's how it reads.

2338
02:59:41,447 --> 02:59:43,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, two more questions, one more question.

2339
02:59:44,449 --> 02:59:50,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Governors Avenue and Forest Street, there's no kiosk or meters on those two streets?

2340
02:59:51,492 --> 02:59:52,672
[SPEAKER_16]: The initial kiosk.

2341
02:59:52,752 --> 02:59:54,253
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you just gonna enforce the signs?

2342
02:59:55,832 --> 03:00:03,776
[SPEAKER_27]: The initial kiosk location was per a consultant study that was done prior to the RFP being issued for this contract.

2343
03:00:04,116 --> 03:00:13,401
[SPEAKER_27]: So all the locations for the kiosk with a few exceptions, uh, were per that report by the consultant, the city hired to do a study of the city.

2344
03:00:14,282 --> 03:00:21,626
[SPEAKER_27]: So we work with cities across the country and I can tell this council and the citizenry that it's always a dynamic situation.

2345
03:00:22,246 --> 03:00:24,107
[SPEAKER_27]: Even parking programs have been placed for,

2346
03:00:25,075 --> 03:00:28,536
[SPEAKER_27]: 50, 60 years, there's always changes that are ongoing.

2347
03:00:28,576 --> 03:00:36,979
[SPEAKER_16]: No, but my question was, Forest Street, there seems to be an awful lot of parking on Forest Street, and also on Governor's Ave, people that leave their cars there all day.

2348
03:00:37,820 --> 03:00:40,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you just gonna enforce the signs that are already there?

2349
03:00:40,841 --> 03:00:45,022
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, if there's not a kiosk, it'll be per the ordinance and the time limits that are in place.

2350
03:00:45,042 --> 03:00:52,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, now who's gonna, now is your signal tracking software gonna be able to say that that car's been there for two hours?

2351
03:00:52,865 --> 03:00:53,185
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.

2352
03:00:57,663 --> 03:01:10,353
[SPEAKER_16]: A few weeks ago, when the last time you were here, I had asked that you'd come back in 60 days and we could review what's gone on in the past.

2353
03:01:10,974 --> 03:01:12,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we still adhere to that?

2354
03:01:12,535 --> 03:01:13,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

2355
03:01:13,075 --> 03:01:15,657
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm available to meet any time that you'd like.

2356
03:01:15,717 --> 03:01:16,338
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's important.

2357
03:01:16,638 --> 03:01:21,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Will yourself and the parking representative come back so we can say, look, it's been 60 days.

2358
03:01:22,826 --> 03:01:26,227
[SPEAKER_16]: these are the problems that are really sticking out, and maybe make some changes then?

2359
03:01:26,607 --> 03:01:27,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

2360
03:01:28,108 --> 03:01:28,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2361
03:01:32,310 --> 03:01:36,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Sir, if you could state your name and address for the record.

2362
03:01:36,231 --> 03:01:37,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Larry Carroll, 31 Richard Street, Medford.

2363
03:01:38,712 --> 03:01:42,093
[SPEAKER_17]: I just heard the gentleman refer to his staff.

2364
03:01:42,393 --> 03:01:43,574
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they officers?

2365
03:01:43,894 --> 03:01:45,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they employees of this company?

2366
03:01:46,595 --> 03:01:48,916
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not quite too sure what that definition of

2367
03:01:49,605 --> 03:01:53,606
[SPEAKER_17]: officers mean, and maybe if you could clarify that a little clearer.

2368
03:02:00,288 --> 03:02:05,610
[SPEAKER_27]: The use of the term officers is not in any way to indicate that they're police officers.

2369
03:02:06,230 --> 03:02:09,791
[SPEAKER_27]: They're what we call enforcement officers in the industry, parking enforcement officers.

2370
03:02:10,211 --> 03:02:12,892
[SPEAKER_27]: The term we actually intend to use is ambassadors.

2371
03:02:17,194 --> 03:02:23,860
[SPEAKER_27]: We hear that in a lot of cities, but we're very successful in rolling our people out to promote the downtown, promote events, to share information.

2372
03:02:23,880 --> 03:02:26,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he's referring to the ticket writers.

2373
03:02:27,403 --> 03:02:28,363
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what I'm talking about.

2374
03:02:29,785 --> 03:02:30,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck.

2375
03:02:34,929 --> 03:02:37,231
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Carol, do you have sir?

2376
03:02:40,914 --> 03:02:43,096
[SPEAKER_34]: Vincent Ciano, 31 Henry street.

2377
03:02:44,157 --> 03:02:45,798
[SPEAKER_34]: Uh, it seems like a, an awful,

2378
03:02:46,307 --> 03:02:47,627
[SPEAKER_34]: confusing program.

2379
03:02:48,588 --> 03:02:54,689
[SPEAKER_34]: It seems like there are more questions than answers, just by all the questions that the counselors have.

2380
03:02:55,649 --> 03:03:02,751
[SPEAKER_34]: But it seems that the people I talk to most don't even know anything about the program at all.

2381
03:03:03,631 --> 03:03:06,512
[SPEAKER_34]: And others know very little.

2382
03:03:06,792 --> 03:03:09,613
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't think this pamphlet explains too much.

2383
03:03:10,473 --> 03:03:13,254
[SPEAKER_34]: But what it boils down to is that

2384
03:03:14,356 --> 03:03:20,679
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't know if the people realize it or not, but now they can't park anywhere in Medford without paying a fee.

2385
03:03:21,760 --> 03:03:26,562
[SPEAKER_34]: You can't park in front of your own home unless you have a permit and pay a fee.

2386
03:03:27,463 --> 03:03:28,984
[SPEAKER_34]: Small, but it's still a fee.

2387
03:03:29,884 --> 03:03:32,745
[SPEAKER_34]: So where do you park?

2388
03:03:34,046 --> 03:03:34,867
[SPEAKER_34]: It's ridiculous.

2389
03:03:37,708 --> 03:03:38,048
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2390
03:03:38,408 --> 03:03:39,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sir.

2391
03:03:40,549 --> 03:03:41,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso.

2392
03:03:42,200 --> 03:03:45,721
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may, this brings up a follow up question and this would be to the chief.

2393
03:03:46,522 --> 03:03:52,184
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some traditionally we know which streets right now in the community of resident permit parking only.

2394
03:03:53,604 --> 03:04:00,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming there's going to be a residual effect on this because now people are going to be leaving place dead road to park and they're going to be parking up the side streets and all that.

2395
03:04:01,908 --> 03:04:09,631
[SPEAKER_11]: At this point, there's some scuttlebutt out there that there's other streets that were added as resident parking permit recently in anticipation of this program.

2396
03:04:09,691 --> 03:04:10,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that true or false?

2397
03:04:11,289 --> 03:04:11,830
[SPEAKER_21]: That's false.

2398
03:04:12,050 --> 03:04:12,410
[SPEAKER_11]: That's false.

2399
03:04:12,530 --> 03:04:15,673
[SPEAKER_21]: One inquiry, one inquiry from a resident of Clulee road.

2400
03:04:15,973 --> 03:04:16,193
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2401
03:04:16,654 --> 03:04:19,676
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they're the first street that does not have permit parking.

2402
03:04:19,696 --> 03:04:20,897
[SPEAKER_21]: I've just had that one inquiry.

2403
03:04:21,598 --> 03:04:24,681
[SPEAKER_21]: She was advised what she needed to do to get it before the traffic commission.

2404
03:04:25,622 --> 03:04:26,662
[SPEAKER_21]: But that was just the other day.

2405
03:04:27,023 --> 03:04:29,265
[SPEAKER_16]: The last street that was added was Hamilton street.

2406
03:04:29,365 --> 03:04:30,366
[SPEAKER_16]: I got one more question.

2407
03:04:30,746 --> 03:04:35,210
[SPEAKER_16]: On that, what you just said on Clulee road, I've had to call some other residents saying that

2408
03:04:35,974 --> 03:04:42,096
[SPEAKER_16]: They're being told that business people have been told can park on certain residential streets.

2409
03:04:42,916 --> 03:04:51,959
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not, well, David designated as business overflow, business parking can park on certain streets outside the business.

2410
03:04:52,079 --> 03:05:02,942
[SPEAKER_21]: As I stated to two weeks ago in West Medford square between Hammond place and Brooke street, I believe it's one hour or business by a business permit.

2411
03:05:03,402 --> 03:05:05,483
[SPEAKER_21]: And then between Brooks and Alston,

2412
03:05:06,429 --> 03:05:09,414
[SPEAKER_21]: On High Street is two hour of business permits.

2413
03:05:09,434 --> 03:05:10,997
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's a combination of those two.

2414
03:05:11,017 --> 03:05:11,538
[SPEAKER_21]: On High Street?

2415
03:05:11,558 --> 03:05:12,941
[SPEAKER_21]: What about on those side streets?

2416
03:05:12,961 --> 03:05:13,081
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2417
03:05:13,361 --> 03:05:13,502
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2418
03:05:13,802 --> 03:05:13,922
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2419
03:05:14,123 --> 03:05:14,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Just on High Street.

2420
03:05:14,744 --> 03:05:17,589
[SPEAKER_21]: Unless there's a street there that's not permit parking.

2421
03:05:18,410 --> 03:05:21,712
[SPEAKER_21]: If there's no permit parking, if there's no restriction, they can park.

2422
03:05:22,072 --> 03:05:22,272
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2423
03:05:22,853 --> 03:05:27,255
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would be up to, because I know exactly what he's referring to, the Cottage Street that I talked to you about.

2424
03:05:27,315 --> 03:05:29,676
[SPEAKER_21]: I've answered several questions from people on Cottage Street.

2425
03:05:29,736 --> 03:05:30,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

2426
03:05:30,236 --> 03:05:31,597
[SPEAKER_21]: Somehow the rumors get started.

2427
03:05:31,977 --> 03:05:32,918
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's the problem.

2428
03:05:33,058 --> 03:05:34,799
[SPEAKER_21]: There's just a lot of misinformation.

2429
03:05:34,819 --> 03:05:36,980
[SPEAKER_21]: And you put a lot of people at ease, though.

2430
03:05:37,320 --> 03:05:38,321
[SPEAKER_21]: The proof is in the pudding.

2431
03:05:38,401 --> 03:05:44,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Once it starts rolling out and actually gets implemented, just what I'm hearing about the permit parking,

2432
03:05:45,485 --> 03:05:49,788
[SPEAKER_21]: took a lot of complaints from the public because we weren't doing enough permit parking enforcement.

2433
03:05:50,708 --> 03:05:52,629
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking forward to seeing that done.

2434
03:05:52,649 --> 03:05:57,192
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you'll see a big change that that that will be a major impact for the residents.

2435
03:05:57,852 --> 03:06:07,758
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, um, my second follow up question is regarding the, uh, the streets and the permit streets for the viewing public, because there will be the residual effect like, um, some street that's not already residential.

2436
03:06:07,798 --> 03:06:08,579
[SPEAKER_11]: People may try to,

2437
03:06:09,339 --> 03:06:17,869
[SPEAKER_11]: beat the system, I'm not going to pay the $5 to park on Police Dead Road, so I'm going to go to one of those streets, Century Woods, Roberts, anything.

2438
03:06:19,511 --> 03:06:27,321
[SPEAKER_11]: If any streets see an influx of vehicles parking, they should get together and petition the community, the City of Medford, through the Chief and the Traffic Commission,

2439
03:06:27,841 --> 03:06:36,892
[SPEAKER_11]: to take a look at making it resident permit parking, because I know that you and the Traffic Commission, what's the official name now?

2440
03:06:36,912 --> 03:06:37,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Traffic Commission, right?

2441
03:06:37,733 --> 03:06:39,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Still Traffic Commission.

2442
03:06:39,555 --> 03:06:42,659
[SPEAKER_11]: With the merging of the off-street parking.

2443
03:06:42,962 --> 03:06:46,044
[SPEAKER_11]: But with that being said, I think people have to be cognizant of that.

2444
03:06:46,084 --> 03:06:57,371
[SPEAKER_11]: If you see an additional people park on your street, and traditionally you can tell when they're out of town is because they have stickers for the dump in Winchester or Lexington Boys and Girls Club or something like that.

2445
03:06:57,752 --> 03:07:07,078
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but if you see an influx of that, bring it to our attention as a city council, the mayor or the chief, and we'll get you before the traffic commission and the chief will do his due diligence.

2446
03:07:07,098 --> 03:07:10,160
[SPEAKER_21]: All they have to do is generate a petition

2447
03:07:10,680 --> 03:07:13,543
[SPEAKER_21]: get several names of residents on the street that are in favor of it.

2448
03:07:14,463 --> 03:07:14,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a hearing.

2449
03:07:15,004 --> 03:07:25,192
[SPEAKER_21]: And Albert Erickson processes that, sends notices out to all of the residents that are listed for that street so that they get to come to a meeting or a call or send us a note whether they're in favor or opposed.

2450
03:07:27,294 --> 03:07:42,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm glad I'm glad you updated the council miss because there was a lot of banter going back and forth that all half the city now is resident permit parking only that they Because of this and at this point there's only been one addition to the last one was Hamilton Hamilton Street And that was two months ago.

2451
03:07:42,165 --> 03:07:50,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay before this was even and for this because this is going live, can you work with the city administration to maybe get the the

2452
03:07:51,221 --> 03:08:01,287
[SPEAKER_11]: the traffic commission's agenda on the city webpage, so people can take a look at it and see what streets around them may be affected by it, and then you can have maximum input from the area.

2453
03:08:02,547 --> 03:08:03,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chief.

2454
03:08:03,788 --> 03:08:04,808
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Cusum.

2455
03:08:04,828 --> 03:08:08,450
[SPEAKER_24]: Before we go to Councilor Mox, the chair has no paper before it.

2456
03:08:09,331 --> 03:08:11,772
[SPEAKER_24]: This has been an informational session.

2457
03:08:11,932 --> 03:08:18,316
[SPEAKER_24]: If the councilors want to formulate a resolution for us to end this with, the chair will entertain that.

2458
03:08:18,376 --> 03:08:20,097
[SPEAKER_24]: I would like to- Councilor Mox.

2459
03:08:21,654 --> 03:08:22,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2460
03:08:22,556 --> 03:08:25,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Chief, just if I could, we referred back to the

2461
03:08:26,385 --> 03:08:34,707
[SPEAKER_09]: parking committee in 2009, one of the recommendations was to have citywide permit parking, or at least to be reviewed.

2462
03:08:35,287 --> 03:08:36,708
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's part of the report.

2463
03:08:37,168 --> 03:08:40,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Has there been any movement on reviewing citywide permit parking?

2464
03:08:40,949 --> 03:08:46,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the approach of having it done piecemeal right now is not adequate enough.

2465
03:08:47,550 --> 03:08:53,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Residents are sending us emails stating the permit only is issued for your particular street.

2466
03:08:54,019 --> 03:09:05,164
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to go visit your sister or your aunt or your cousin, still in Method, you can't take your resident permit parking sticker and go to another section of Method, which to me is ridiculous.

2467
03:09:05,184 --> 03:09:05,744
[SPEAKER_21]: That's correct.

2468
03:09:05,824 --> 03:09:07,205
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's age old.

2469
03:09:07,625 --> 03:09:13,067
[SPEAKER_21]: When the permit parking regulations were formed back in the late seventies, early eighties, it was street by street.

2470
03:09:13,548 --> 03:09:17,669
[SPEAKER_21]: And at that time, for the most part, it was the hillside area around Tufts university.

2471
03:09:18,330 --> 03:09:20,311
[SPEAKER_21]: But there has been discussion.

2472
03:09:20,331 --> 03:09:23,132
[SPEAKER_21]: I've spoken with Dan Nash and uh,

2473
03:09:23,628 --> 03:09:30,073
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, there's, there's now we're going to have some data to look at and really see what the impact will be on permanent parking.

2474
03:09:30,673 --> 03:09:37,539
[SPEAKER_21]: And we either will go through a zone so that, you know, it's a neighborhood area or we'll go citywide.

2475
03:09:38,279 --> 03:09:48,507
[SPEAKER_21]: But I don't see that happening before next year because everyone's getting their permit now and it's street by street because I think there's still going to be an equal number of people who want

2476
03:09:49,393 --> 03:09:51,534
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, just their street, which really isn't right.

2477
03:09:51,574 --> 03:10:04,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Every time we talk to a group, we let them know, okay, it was passed for your street, but remember you're part of a neighborhood and you know, someone on the next street over whose permits, who has a permit, it's just not enough spaces.

2478
03:10:04,583 --> 03:10:07,785
[SPEAKER_21]: They should be able to park on this street because it's just down the street from their house.

2479
03:10:08,246 --> 03:10:09,026
[SPEAKER_21]: It's part of a neighborhood.

2480
03:10:09,046 --> 03:10:10,007
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're looking at zone.

2481
03:10:10,633 --> 03:10:13,115
[SPEAKER_21]: either doing by zone or doing citywide.

2482
03:10:13,715 --> 03:10:24,103
[SPEAKER_21]: So anyone in the city who's registered in the city, even if they don't have a permit parking street, if they want to purchase a permit so that they have the opportunity to park, there'd be no reason to deny them.

2483
03:10:24,744 --> 03:10:35,152
[SPEAKER_09]: And chief, and I think Gwen Blackburn, who's still here, can attest to the fact when we visited Malden, Everett, Somerville, Boston, the committee itself,

2484
03:10:36,095 --> 03:10:39,076
[SPEAKER_09]: everyone came back to us and said, you know what?

2485
03:10:39,836 --> 03:10:43,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep whatever parking enforcement you do free from city hall.

2486
03:10:44,177 --> 03:10:45,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't locate it at city hall.

2487
03:10:45,757 --> 03:10:47,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep it away from city hall.

2488
03:10:47,918 --> 03:10:49,738
[SPEAKER_09]: And we heard that over and over again.

2489
03:10:50,499 --> 03:10:54,660
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we did was create an enforcement office on main street, which is great.

2490
03:10:54,980 --> 03:10:56,160
[SPEAKER_09]: That's free from city hall.

2491
03:10:56,800 --> 03:11:01,721
[SPEAKER_09]: But the mayor outsourced everything other than the hearings, the appeals.

2492
03:11:02,862 --> 03:11:03,882
[SPEAKER_09]: The one thing you'd say,

2493
03:11:04,409 --> 03:11:06,851
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to be involved with the appeal process.

2494
03:11:07,251 --> 03:11:08,572
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor kept that in-house.

2495
03:11:09,172 --> 03:11:12,194
[SPEAKER_09]: He not only kept it in-house, he kept it here at City Hall.

2496
03:11:13,735 --> 03:11:18,518
[SPEAKER_09]: So it flies in the face of everything that we heard in the past.

2497
03:11:19,358 --> 03:11:33,727
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the mayor took it one step further and said that he didn't believe with this new enforcement program that there was going to be an increase that would merit or warrant someone, because we only have a part-time person that does the hearings now.

2498
03:11:34,325 --> 03:11:43,107
[SPEAKER_09]: and he didn't believe, with all this new ticketing, that we would need someone to do hearings, which makes no sense at all to me.

2499
03:11:43,607 --> 03:11:44,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely no sense.

2500
03:11:45,128 --> 03:11:48,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So the two points is, leaving it out of city hall, he kept it here.

2501
03:11:49,549 --> 03:12:03,792
[SPEAKER_09]: The other point is, you have a part-time person, Diane McLeod, who works full-time at a real job, and does this on a part-time, and now she's gonna be asked to do a program that, there was no enforcement in the city, very little,

2502
03:12:04,298 --> 03:12:05,679
[SPEAKER_09]: to now full-blown enforcement.

2503
03:12:06,159 --> 03:12:07,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't see it happening.

2504
03:12:07,779 --> 03:12:13,342
[SPEAKER_09]: We asked that money be put in the budget to pay for another hearing officer, and the mayor denied it.

2505
03:12:13,902 --> 03:12:17,644
[SPEAKER_09]: So I still don't know how that's going to work, Chief.

2506
03:12:17,744 --> 03:12:19,824
[SPEAKER_21]: That change may happen down the road again.

2507
03:12:19,844 --> 03:12:22,926
[SPEAKER_21]: I know the situation went down the road when they see what the impact is.

2508
03:12:22,986 --> 03:12:26,847
[SPEAKER_21]: But Diane McLeod obviously does a great job with what she does.

2509
03:12:26,927 --> 03:12:28,388
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have to tell you that

2510
03:12:29,448 --> 03:12:31,690
[SPEAKER_21]: She goes out and researches any ticket appeal.

2511
03:12:31,730 --> 03:12:32,771
[SPEAKER_21]: She goes out to the streets.

2512
03:12:33,271 --> 03:12:36,313
[SPEAKER_21]: She looks at the neighborhoods that where the person was cited.

2513
03:12:36,434 --> 03:12:44,079
[SPEAKER_21]: She calls the police department, Sergeant Carroll sometime at the current flow chief at the car, which is minimal to none, but she does a thorough job.

2514
03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:45,861
[SPEAKER_21]: But with this program,

2515
03:12:46,560 --> 03:12:50,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Even if she gets 100 appeals, there's going to be backup data.

2516
03:12:50,241 --> 03:12:52,342
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to have a picture of the car in violation.

2517
03:12:52,622 --> 03:12:54,603
[SPEAKER_21]: You have two options.

2518
03:12:54,803 --> 03:12:56,603
[SPEAKER_21]: You pay the ticket, or you appeal.

2519
03:12:56,623 --> 03:13:04,866
[SPEAKER_09]: But Chief, think about all the different policies that haven't been outlined yet, all the different appeals that people are going to come up with and say, you know what, you told me this or that.

2520
03:13:04,886 --> 03:13:08,687
[SPEAKER_09]: That person is going to be inundated with hearings.

2521
03:13:08,747 --> 03:13:12,029
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think initially, she will be inundated.

2522
03:13:12,309 --> 03:13:16,350
[SPEAKER_21]: But as time goes on and compliance rates pick up, which we've seen in the past, whenever we did

2523
03:13:17,202 --> 03:13:22,725
[SPEAKER_21]: extensive ticketing, within a week or two, you got compliance, and the tickets started to drop off because people complied.

2524
03:13:23,085 --> 03:13:26,906
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, when you went away for a month, things went back to the old way.

2525
03:13:27,807 --> 03:13:33,890
[SPEAKER_21]: I honestly believe, after a few months of regular, consistent, steady enforcement, you will see compliance.

2526
03:13:34,710 --> 03:13:36,851
[SPEAKER_21]: But I agree, the first few months are going to be difficult.

2527
03:13:36,871 --> 03:13:41,473
[SPEAKER_09]: The President And if we see compliance, Republicans are going to be in a lot of trouble because they're not going to get their revenue.

2528
03:13:42,542 --> 03:13:44,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Their revenue is not based on feeding the meter.

2529
03:13:45,023 --> 03:13:45,843
[SPEAKER_09]: It's based on ticketing.

2530
03:13:45,863 --> 03:13:46,923
[SPEAKER_09]: In life, there's risk, right?

2531
03:13:46,963 --> 03:13:49,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Two-thirds of their revenue is based on ticketing, not meters.

2532
03:13:51,385 --> 03:13:56,286
[SPEAKER_09]: So if compliance is there, and I hope that's correct, they're going to be out of business very shortly.

2533
03:13:57,026 --> 03:13:59,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I look at Somerville as the model.

2534
03:14:00,027 --> 03:14:01,828
[SPEAKER_21]: $8 million a year, and they keep climbing.

2535
03:14:01,848 --> 03:14:03,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but they hide behind bushes, Chief.

2536
03:14:03,328 --> 03:14:04,708
[SPEAKER_21]: And you said that's not going to happen in Method.

2537
03:14:05,609 --> 03:14:07,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Because there's enough low-bearing fruit to grab.

2538
03:14:07,929 --> 03:14:09,290
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't have to hide behind the bushes.

2539
03:14:11,825 --> 03:14:13,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Chief.

2540
03:14:13,286 --> 03:14:16,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2541
03:14:16,929 --> 03:14:22,733
[SPEAKER_26]: Chief, do you have any idea right now under the current system what percentage of tickets are issued?

2542
03:14:24,114 --> 03:14:25,995
[SPEAKER_26]: What percentage of issued tickets are appealed?

2543
03:14:27,116 --> 03:14:27,776
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

2544
03:14:30,638 --> 03:14:34,321
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the bulk of the appeals happen with snow emergencies and street sweeping.

2545
03:14:34,821 --> 03:14:39,384
[SPEAKER_21]: That's probably the heaviest time we do any ticketing, or have been doing over the past couple of years.

2546
03:14:40,265 --> 03:14:40,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2547
03:14:42,178 --> 03:14:43,039
[SPEAKER_24]: All set, Councilor Knight?

2548
03:14:43,219 --> 03:14:43,599
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, thank you.

2549
03:14:43,999 --> 03:14:44,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta?

2550
03:14:44,760 --> 03:14:47,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, at the outset, I probably should have said this right in the beginning.

2551
03:14:48,522 --> 03:14:49,283
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't belong here.

2552
03:14:49,323 --> 03:14:50,083
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor belongs here.

2553
03:14:50,123 --> 03:14:51,264
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not your program.

2554
03:14:51,284 --> 03:14:52,324
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the mayor's program.

2555
03:14:52,565 --> 03:14:53,765
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm involved.

2556
03:14:53,845 --> 03:14:56,327
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're doing his nasty work right now.

2557
03:14:56,367 --> 03:14:57,048
[SPEAKER_14]: That's number one.

2558
03:14:57,448 --> 03:15:04,092
[SPEAKER_14]: About three weeks ago, Dan, you and I, and I think a fellow by the name of John N. Candola, met at the coffee shop.

2559
03:15:04,652 --> 03:15:06,594
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to get back to your comment, Councilor Marks.

2560
03:15:07,423 --> 03:15:10,085
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a lot of conversation about a lot of the concerns that are out there.

2561
03:15:10,106 --> 03:15:13,909
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think you agreed and you said basically a lot of the things you and I were talking about, you agreed.

2562
03:15:14,530 --> 03:15:17,252
[SPEAKER_14]: One big issue, the appeal process.

2563
03:15:17,352 --> 03:15:18,113
[SPEAKER_14]: And what did you say?

2564
03:15:18,173 --> 03:15:18,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

2565
03:15:18,954 --> 03:15:19,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll paraphrase you.

2566
03:15:20,175 --> 03:15:24,619
[SPEAKER_14]: You said, if there was one thing you oppressed upon the mayor, keep it out of city hall, get an outside independent person.

2567
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:26,561
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what you said.

2568
03:15:30,749 --> 03:15:32,490
[SPEAKER_20]: Dan Nash, Regional Manager of Public Parking.

2569
03:15:33,091 --> 03:15:45,478
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the things that we had suggested was to provide administrative hearing through our office to try to weed out some of the appeals that may come through that could be administered prior to going to City Hall.

2570
03:15:45,518 --> 03:15:53,083
[SPEAKER_20]: But at no point were we anticipating removing anyone, the final administrative hearing process or the hearing process from City Hall.

2571
03:15:53,123 --> 03:15:54,244
[SPEAKER_20]: That was never on the table.

2572
03:15:54,704 --> 03:15:59,767
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you indicated at that point in time, it would be wise and advisable to hire an outside independent person

2573
03:16:00,191 --> 03:16:04,112
[SPEAKER_14]: That way there would be no conflict as it relates to the parking ticket and city hall.

2574
03:16:04,392 --> 03:16:20,658
[SPEAKER_20]: But what I talked to you about is something that we had done in Springfield, Mass, where we had hired a outside attorney to come in and administrative hearings, uh, through the office to try to take care of some of the burden that might be left on the city's actual appeal process.

2575
03:16:20,738 --> 03:16:25,179
[SPEAKER_14]: So your recommendation is almost the same, whether it be Springfield and Medford or what have you.

2576
03:16:25,439 --> 03:16:26,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Why should Medford be any different than Springfield?

2577
03:16:28,862 --> 03:16:29,923
[SPEAKER_14]: I think every city's different.

2578
03:16:30,363 --> 03:16:31,143
[SPEAKER_20]: Springfield's huge.

2579
03:16:31,904 --> 03:16:41,810
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think part of that and discussions with the administration is to allow the process to go see what happens.

2580
03:16:41,890 --> 03:16:47,814
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the chief explained it very well just briefly is we know that the first couple of months there will probably be an influx in appeals.

2581
03:16:48,334 --> 03:16:54,578
[SPEAKER_20]: And if we see that that number is not dwindling down, then there are options that we could put into place to help assist with the appeal process.

2582
03:16:55,879 --> 03:16:57,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think that's something that should have been discussed

2583
03:16:58,292 --> 03:17:10,939
[SPEAKER_14]: and finalized and included in the contract, but just for the type of terminology that you're saying, that if in fact it gets to a point in time, as Councilor Moxley alluded to, and then an outside independent person needs to come in if they want to start off small, but the mayor was adamant.

2584
03:17:11,439 --> 03:17:17,322
[SPEAKER_14]: So if the mayor is going to be that adamant that Diane McLeod is a lovely person, she does her job, she has a full-time job to do.

2585
03:17:17,963 --> 03:17:23,686
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know how she's going to be able to pick up and chief, even though you said she may get all the technological thing, it might go up to a hundred.

2586
03:17:23,746 --> 03:17:25,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, a hundred appeals is a hundred appeals.

2587
03:17:25,707 --> 03:17:27,848
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a lot to take care of during a period of time.

2588
03:17:28,407 --> 03:17:35,572
[SPEAKER_14]: But all I know is this, that if I was a contributor to the mayor of this community, and I wound up getting a ticket, I'd be knocking on his door and saying, hey, what's this all about?

2589
03:17:35,832 --> 03:17:37,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're not going to get another contribution from me.

2590
03:17:38,133 --> 03:17:40,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Because he kept it here in City Hall, which is wrong.

2591
03:17:40,815 --> 03:17:41,836
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be out of City Hall.

2592
03:17:42,096 --> 03:17:46,899
[SPEAKER_14]: If this program really wanted to work its way right, it would be completely independent to anything that's political.

2593
03:17:47,419 --> 03:17:51,402
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you have to work out these little things, Councilor Camuso, I probably agree with you in one thing.

2594
03:17:52,142 --> 03:17:52,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's this.

2595
03:17:53,183 --> 03:17:53,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2596
03:17:53,628 --> 03:17:55,309
[SPEAKER_14]: on this particular thing, and I think it's a big one.

2597
03:17:55,389 --> 03:18:07,839
[SPEAKER_14]: I think if you were going to put meters in the city, you should have put meters so everybody that drove up would have seen them, they would have been able to understand it, the signage would have said how long you could have stayed, and this would have relieved an awful lot, an awful lot of the grief that's here.

2598
03:18:08,185 --> 03:18:10,486
[SPEAKER_14]: But your inconsistencies are all over the city.

2599
03:18:10,506 --> 03:18:14,667
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not saying you, because you guys are only doing as you said where the mayor told you to do.

2600
03:18:15,187 --> 03:18:30,873
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't understand how you can go down Main Street from Medford Square to South Medford and have blocks of stores, have nothing at all, and then go to West Medford where there are kiosks, go to Haines Square where there are kiosks, and then Haines Square, at the end of Haines Square come to Medford Square,

2601
03:18:31,363 --> 03:18:36,447
[SPEAKER_14]: as Mr. Dobbs indicated, have had the same blocks of stores, like businesses, not having anything.

2602
03:18:37,047 --> 03:18:45,313
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you're going to say you're going to roll it out further, there's another phase to this, that means there's going to be more anguish and more heartache to the people in this community.

2603
03:18:46,133 --> 03:18:47,314
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not Newbury Street.

2604
03:18:47,354 --> 03:18:49,295
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have to get up at 7 o'clock in the morning.

2605
03:18:49,476 --> 03:18:59,603
[SPEAKER_14]: And Newbury Street in Boston is the only place where they did this experiment with the kiosk, because the other parts of Boston still have the, and Brookline, who had the kiosk, got rid of it, because it was damning to the business community out there.

2606
03:19:00,183 --> 03:19:01,544
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not one of these communities.

2607
03:19:01,785 --> 03:19:03,086
[SPEAKER_14]: We're a simple little community.

2608
03:19:03,786 --> 03:19:04,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information.

2609
03:19:05,768 --> 03:19:15,778
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Knight.

2610
03:19:15,818 --> 03:19:19,221
[SPEAKER_26]: Canal Street, Friend Street, Portland Street, they all have kiosks.

2611
03:19:19,521 --> 03:19:20,282
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not station.

2612
03:19:20,342 --> 03:19:21,483
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not downtown Boston.

2613
03:19:22,782 --> 03:19:31,031
[SPEAKER_26]: A number of different communities in New York City, New York State, California, Los Angeles County, they have kiosks.

2614
03:19:31,211 --> 03:19:36,157
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that they're new, they're scary, but at the end of the day, we're going to be able to figure it out.

2615
03:19:36,177 --> 03:19:38,059
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think that we're giving the public enough credit.

2616
03:19:38,439 --> 03:19:41,842
[SPEAKER_26]: in terms of their ability to adapt to new technology.

2617
03:19:41,903 --> 03:19:42,463
[SPEAKER_26]: We've all done it.

2618
03:19:42,743 --> 03:19:47,368
[SPEAKER_26]: We've seen people come along and be able to work computers like wizards after a couple of weeks.

2619
03:19:47,748 --> 03:19:48,469
[SPEAKER_26]: It is what it is.

2620
03:19:48,529 --> 03:19:56,977
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that, you know, we're in a situation right now where we can go and we can talk about the past and we can talk about what happened, or we can look forward to see, all right, these are coming in.

2621
03:19:57,217 --> 03:19:58,018
[SPEAKER_26]: What's the process?

2622
03:19:58,078 --> 03:20:00,920
[SPEAKER_26]: How are we going to deal with our griefs and our gripes and our grievances?

2623
03:20:01,381 --> 03:20:03,583
[SPEAKER_26]: And in order for us to move forward,

2624
03:20:03,906 --> 03:20:06,549
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we really need to look at the plan and say the plan's in place.

2625
03:20:07,310 --> 03:20:09,012
[SPEAKER_26]: These are the, these are the recourses that we have.

2626
03:20:09,353 --> 03:20:10,534
[SPEAKER_26]: The traffic commission governs.

2627
03:20:11,195 --> 03:20:14,158
[SPEAKER_26]: We have the traffic commission and we go to the traffic commission.

2628
03:20:14,439 --> 03:20:15,119
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the process.

2629
03:20:15,139 --> 03:20:16,181
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a process in place.

2630
03:20:16,221 --> 03:20:24,050
[SPEAKER_26]: Now we can talk about the process that didn't happen to get us to where we are, or we can look forward and we can say, this is the process that we need to take in order to make this a successful plan.

2631
03:20:24,544 --> 03:20:26,446
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's where I am with this, Mr. President.

2632
03:20:26,726 --> 03:20:29,309
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that, you know, the history is the history.

2633
03:20:29,369 --> 03:20:30,270
[SPEAKER_26]: We all know what we voted for.

2634
03:20:30,550 --> 03:20:33,373
[SPEAKER_26]: We voted to give the mayor the authority to enter into a contract for 10 years.

2635
03:20:33,434 --> 03:20:34,034
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what we did.

2636
03:20:34,375 --> 03:20:36,197
[SPEAKER_26]: And we allowed him to go to the table and negotiate.

2637
03:20:36,537 --> 03:20:39,060
[SPEAKER_26]: He went to the table, he negotiated, and this is what he came back with.

2638
03:20:39,520 --> 03:20:40,341
[SPEAKER_26]: We have our concerns.

2639
03:20:40,381 --> 03:20:41,242
[SPEAKER_26]: We all have our concerns.

2640
03:20:41,262 --> 03:20:45,807
[SPEAKER_26]: And we've all had individual conversations with the chief and with the people from Republic and with the administration.

2641
03:20:46,167 --> 03:20:57,974
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think that right now, for the people out there that have concerns and that are scared and that are worried about what's going to happen, we need to tell them what the process is and provide them with an avenue to get answers to have their concerns addressed.

2642
03:20:58,314 --> 03:21:04,357
[SPEAKER_26]: Because in my experiences so far, I've gotten a number of calls about people that had issues about loading zones, and loading zones have been made.

2643
03:21:05,117 --> 03:21:11,941
[SPEAKER_26]: The folks from Republic have been pretty reasonable in terms of making accommodations to make this program and plan work for them.

2644
03:21:13,802 --> 03:21:25,329
[SPEAKER_26]: If we're going to roll out a plan that's going to be successful and that people are going to buy into, we need to look at the future and what avenues we have in order to address problems, not the past and what didn't happen and what should have.

2645
03:21:25,830 --> 03:21:27,611
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Counselor, for your point of information.

2646
03:21:27,631 --> 03:21:31,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Penta has the floor.

2647
03:21:31,133 --> 03:21:35,676
[SPEAKER_14]: I disagree extremely with Counselor Knight on this because the past is the leader of the future.

2648
03:21:35,916 --> 03:21:38,898
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you can't learn from the past, the future will never have any value.

2649
03:21:39,429 --> 03:21:40,711
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact of the matter is this.

2650
03:21:41,091 --> 03:21:42,073
[SPEAKER_14]: There was no process.

2651
03:21:42,133 --> 03:21:42,914
[SPEAKER_14]: It never took place.

2652
03:21:43,194 --> 03:21:45,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And every time you keep saying, well, we have no recourse.

2653
03:21:45,417 --> 03:21:46,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go forward.

2654
03:21:46,118 --> 03:21:48,141
[SPEAKER_14]: How can you go forward when you don't even know what took place?

2655
03:21:48,382 --> 03:21:52,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you weren't a part of it, when you were asked to be a part of it, when you were told to be a part of it.

2656
03:21:52,568 --> 03:21:54,791
[SPEAKER_14]: And you never voted for the finalization of the contract.

2657
03:21:54,991 --> 03:21:56,072
[SPEAKER_14]: The man took it upon himself.

2658
03:21:58,343 --> 03:22:01,745
[SPEAKER_14]: The bottom line to this whole thing is that there's a whole bunch of issues here.

2659
03:22:02,065 --> 03:22:04,206
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are only here for one reason, that's to make money.

2660
03:22:04,246 --> 03:22:07,688
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not here to help the city of Medford, you're here to get your salary and to make money.

2661
03:22:07,948 --> 03:22:13,471
[SPEAKER_14]: So as far as that concern, you should probably sit down because the real questions that need to be asked, the mayor, he's the one that should be here.

2662
03:22:13,711 --> 03:22:16,952
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the one that should be explaining all of this to the people that's going on.

2663
03:22:18,093 --> 03:22:19,814
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me ask you something, sir.

2664
03:22:20,694 --> 03:22:23,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm gonna ask him something, he wants to stay there.

2665
03:22:24,438 --> 03:22:25,759
[SPEAKER_14]: I like him, he's a nice guy.

2666
03:22:26,359 --> 03:22:27,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me ask you something.

2667
03:22:27,379 --> 03:22:27,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2668
03:22:27,939 --> 03:22:30,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I have pictures here of you people bolting signs to trees.

2669
03:22:30,520 --> 03:22:31,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Why did you bolt the signs to the trees?

2670
03:22:32,961 --> 03:22:33,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Were you told to do that?

2671
03:22:34,742 --> 03:22:35,242
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we were not.

2672
03:22:35,442 --> 03:22:36,482
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you do it yourself?

2673
03:22:36,502 --> 03:22:43,905
[SPEAKER_20]: The signs that you see there, you know, what we did is we went along with what we had seen throughout the city, which were signs on trees.

2674
03:22:43,945 --> 03:22:45,766
[SPEAKER_20]: That's one I think is right out in front of Amici's.

2675
03:22:46,206 --> 03:22:51,528
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a one hour parking sign that was bolted to that tree that we took down and put back up.

2676
03:22:51,833 --> 03:22:53,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what about the signs in Haines Square?

2677
03:22:53,875 --> 03:22:54,856
[SPEAKER_20]: There was nothing on those trees.

2678
03:22:54,976 --> 03:22:55,757
[SPEAKER_20]: We made a mistake.

2679
03:22:56,357 --> 03:22:58,039
[SPEAKER_20]: I personally made a mistake because I told the staff.

2680
03:22:58,059 --> 03:23:00,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, didn't the mayor give you any instructions not to bolt signs on trees?

2681
03:23:00,821 --> 03:23:01,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Did anybody tell you that?

2682
03:23:01,882 --> 03:23:03,043
[SPEAKER_14]: It's against the ordinance to do that.

2683
03:23:03,824 --> 03:23:05,185
[SPEAKER_20]: It was my fault for not checking the ordinance.

2684
03:23:05,205 --> 03:23:07,727
[SPEAKER_14]: No, did anybody tell you if you're going to put the signs up?

2685
03:23:07,747 --> 03:23:09,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2686
03:23:09,309 --> 03:23:10,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Counselor Camuto.

2687
03:23:10,590 --> 03:23:11,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Either yes or no.

2688
03:23:11,671 --> 03:23:18,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Not to throw this gentleman under the bus, but normal person says you don't put the sign on the tree.

2689
03:23:19,768 --> 03:23:22,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the guy's acknowledging he made a mistake.

2690
03:23:22,250 --> 03:23:22,951
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to beat him up?

2691
03:23:22,991 --> 03:23:23,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Who didn't tell him?

2692
03:23:23,571 --> 03:23:24,372
[SPEAKER_11]: The chief, the police?

2693
03:23:24,392 --> 03:23:25,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because it's important.

2694
03:23:25,553 --> 03:23:26,854
[SPEAKER_14]: It's part of what this process is all about.

2695
03:23:26,874 --> 03:23:27,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand, counselor.

2696
03:23:27,795 --> 03:23:29,376
[SPEAKER_11]: But did you lock your car when you come in tonight?

2697
03:23:29,516 --> 03:23:29,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I did.

2698
03:23:29,816 --> 03:23:30,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you lock your car?

2699
03:23:30,637 --> 03:23:31,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I did.

2700
03:23:31,357 --> 03:23:35,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we're going volley here on ridiculous stuff now.

2701
03:23:35,080 --> 03:23:36,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's in your mind.

2702
03:23:36,402 --> 03:23:37,122
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's in your mind.

2703
03:23:37,142 --> 03:23:38,964
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why your mind and mine is entirely different.

2704
03:23:38,984 --> 03:23:39,544
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

2705
03:23:39,584 --> 03:23:40,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank God.

2706
03:23:40,385 --> 03:23:41,526
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a pitch, counselor.

2707
03:23:41,826 --> 03:23:42,286
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a pitch.

2708
03:23:42,306 --> 03:23:43,187
[SPEAKER_24]: Just answer your question.

2709
03:23:44,658 --> 03:23:49,661
[SPEAKER_24]: The gentleman did answer the question, and we want to avoid a prosecutorial tone.

2710
03:23:49,681 --> 03:23:51,142
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not prosecuting anybody.

2711
03:23:51,702 --> 03:23:53,503
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor Camuso, point of information.

2712
03:23:53,543 --> 03:23:57,906
[SPEAKER_11]: To follow up on that, Aggie Tudin was very, very helpful in straightening the situation out.

2713
03:23:58,046 --> 03:24:00,127
[SPEAKER_11]: So kudos to her.

2714
03:24:00,528 --> 03:24:02,849
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if she actually talked to you or someone in your office.

2715
03:24:02,869 --> 03:24:04,690
[SPEAKER_11]: She's our tree warden here and arborist.

2716
03:24:05,431 --> 03:24:06,491
[SPEAKER_11]: And she was very concerned.

2717
03:24:08,351 --> 03:24:09,713
[SPEAKER_11]: She took the bull by the horns on that.

2718
03:24:09,733 --> 03:24:10,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

2719
03:24:13,257 --> 03:24:14,839
[SPEAKER_26]: Followed by Councilor Caravaglio.

2720
03:24:14,939 --> 03:24:16,542
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2721
03:24:18,164 --> 03:24:21,127
[SPEAKER_26]: Personally, I don't feel as though Republic should be putting up any signs, Mr. President.

2722
03:24:21,328 --> 03:24:23,651
[SPEAKER_26]: And the reason so is because that work is DPW work.

2723
03:24:23,691 --> 03:24:25,353
[SPEAKER_26]: And we have a gentleman in the sign shop.

2724
03:24:25,793 --> 03:24:28,575
[SPEAKER_26]: who has a job, and his job is to be in charge of the signs.

2725
03:24:28,995 --> 03:24:36,559
[SPEAKER_26]: So this subletting of work that should be done by the DBW, I feel as though is a problem, Mr. President.

2726
03:24:36,619 --> 03:24:38,319
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that this work should be handled internally.

2727
03:24:38,359 --> 03:24:44,583
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a sign shop, we have a gentleman that's in charge of signs, and we have a gentleman who's well versed in the ordinances in the city of Medford.

2728
03:24:44,643 --> 03:24:47,364
[SPEAKER_26]: Quite frankly, Mr. Nash isn't from Medford, he came to this city.

2729
03:24:48,087 --> 03:24:52,310
[SPEAKER_26]: and maybe he relied on what he saw or what he's seen in other communities, so be it.

2730
03:24:52,611 --> 03:24:58,435
[SPEAKER_26]: But we have a sign shop, we have gentlemen in the DPW who know our ordinances, and I think that this is where the work should lie, not outside.

2731
03:24:58,455 --> 03:24:59,856
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2732
03:24:59,916 --> 03:25:00,616
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Pentez.

2733
03:25:00,676 --> 03:25:02,998
[SPEAKER_14]: In response to Councilor Knight, that's absolutely not true.

2734
03:25:03,018 --> 03:25:08,382
[SPEAKER_14]: If you read the contract in the IRFP, they made the commitment to put the signs up and to replace the signs that are there.

2735
03:25:08,842 --> 03:25:10,283
[SPEAKER_14]: That's part of the contract.

2736
03:25:11,284 --> 03:25:12,705
[SPEAKER_26]: Any information, Councilor Knight?

2737
03:25:14,909 --> 03:25:20,072
[SPEAKER_26]: The contract that you're referring to is the contract with Republic, but the City of Medford also has a contract.

2738
03:25:20,092 --> 03:25:26,115
[SPEAKER_26]: The contract is with the Medford DPW Association, represented by Local 25, and they have rights.

2739
03:25:26,535 --> 03:25:34,219
[SPEAKER_26]: And if they aren't willing to sublet their work, and they haven't had an opportunity to negotiate the impact of the subletting of their work, then there's a violation.

2740
03:25:34,439 --> 03:25:36,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

2741
03:25:37,481 --> 03:25:39,842
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you saying the may is in violation of the contract?

2742
03:25:41,483 --> 03:25:42,324
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you just stated.

2743
03:25:43,630 --> 03:25:49,791
[SPEAKER_26]: that the union contract has been repudiated based upon the fact that outside people- So you're just stating again tonight that the may is in violation of the union contract?

2744
03:25:49,811 --> 03:25:51,052
[SPEAKER_25]: That's my interpretation, yes.

2745
03:25:51,212 --> 03:25:51,992
[SPEAKER_25]: That's my interpretation.

2746
03:25:52,052 --> 03:25:53,672
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe the union contract has been repudiated.

2747
03:25:53,692 --> 03:25:55,912
[SPEAKER_24]: The DPW workers are suitably employed.

2748
03:25:56,473 --> 03:26:08,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Penta has- Yeah, the contract and the IRFP and the three pages of questions that were asked for which you, Republic, indicated that you folks would put up the signs and you would replace- is that true or false?

2749
03:26:08,895 --> 03:26:11,816
[SPEAKER_14]: That you would replace and put up the signs that were existing.

2750
03:26:12,556 --> 03:26:13,416
[SPEAKER_14]: That's part of the contract.

2751
03:26:14,100 --> 03:26:16,341
[SPEAKER_20]: part of the contract was, yes, we were responsible.

2752
03:26:16,381 --> 03:26:17,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

2753
03:26:17,242 --> 03:26:17,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2754
03:26:17,862 --> 03:26:18,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Not the city of Medford.

2755
03:26:19,103 --> 03:26:24,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, we have a, I have a picture here of one of your kiosks in front of Oak Grove cemetery on the sidewalk.

2756
03:26:25,467 --> 03:26:29,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you please explain in the middle of a snowstorm when they go down the street to plow the sidewalk?

2757
03:26:31,268 --> 03:26:32,749
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2758
03:26:32,789 --> 03:26:34,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

2759
03:26:34,790 --> 03:26:37,773
[SPEAKER_11]: That area in particular is maintained by the Cemetery Department.

2760
03:26:38,253 --> 03:26:44,758
[SPEAKER_11]: And they actually do that whole area, as you probably know, Counselor, from your expertise in that particular area.

2761
03:26:45,198 --> 03:26:48,300
[SPEAKER_11]: It's done very early in the snowstorms.

2762
03:26:48,901 --> 03:26:51,182
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure it will continue to be done.

2763
03:26:52,143 --> 03:26:52,844
[SPEAKER_11]: What expertise?

2764
03:26:52,864 --> 03:26:53,344
[SPEAKER_14]: You do this?

2765
03:26:53,744 --> 03:26:54,825
[SPEAKER_14]: You plow the sidewalk, Counselor?

2766
03:26:54,865 --> 03:26:55,105
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

2767
03:26:55,145 --> 03:26:58,248
[SPEAKER_11]: His expertise, he's up in that area a lot, given the nature of his business.

2768
03:26:58,268 --> 03:26:59,909
[SPEAKER_14]: You do the plowing on the sidewalk, yes or no?

2769
03:27:01,333 --> 03:27:03,615
[SPEAKER_14]: In front of Oak Grove Cemetery, do you plow the sidewalk there?

2770
03:27:03,655 --> 03:27:04,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes or no?

2771
03:27:04,376 --> 03:27:05,057
[SPEAKER_14]: You're an expert.

2772
03:27:05,357 --> 03:27:05,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes or no?

2773
03:27:06,198 --> 03:27:07,319
[SPEAKER_24]: Do I plow the sidewalk?

2774
03:27:07,339 --> 03:27:07,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2775
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:08,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2776
03:27:08,861 --> 03:27:10,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, it'd help if they asked.

2777
03:27:11,523 --> 03:27:13,145
[SPEAKER_14]: You have one in the middle of the sidewalk there.

2778
03:27:13,225 --> 03:27:16,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any particular reason why I had to go there and not other places?

2779
03:27:19,311 --> 03:27:20,913
[SPEAKER_14]: And this spot also has $5 a day parking, so.

2780
03:27:25,299 --> 03:27:26,641
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, Councillor.

2781
03:27:26,661 --> 03:27:31,686
[SPEAKER_11]: The $5 a day is for out-of-town residents that get on the commuter line or the bus.

2782
03:27:32,957 --> 03:27:40,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Five dollars a day is a bargain, it's a steal to come to the city of Medford, take the bus, go to Boston, and to park there, five dollars a day.

2783
03:27:40,384 --> 03:27:48,331
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you have to go down to West Medford, South Medford, North Medford, or Medford Square, you gotta pay to put the money in the quarter, and the most you can do is stay there for two hours.

2784
03:27:48,651 --> 03:27:50,793
[SPEAKER_14]: So how is that a bargain for the people of Medford?

2785
03:27:51,374 --> 03:27:52,174
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a bargain.

2786
03:27:53,696 --> 03:27:58,280
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't, I don't want an out-of-towner coming here for five days when a homegrown person's gonna pay more.

2787
03:28:00,714 --> 03:28:08,496
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to applaud you, once again, for acknowledging my fine work in bringing forward the resolution to ban the out-of-towners from parking in Medford.

2788
03:28:08,597 --> 03:28:11,237
[SPEAKER_11]: And you actually supported it amongst all of us councillors.

2789
03:28:11,477 --> 03:28:13,218
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank you for your fine support on that.

2790
03:28:13,458 --> 03:28:14,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your point of information.

2791
03:28:14,598 --> 03:28:16,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if we're agreeing, what are you yelling at me for?

2792
03:28:16,259 --> 03:28:19,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I love you.

2793
03:28:19,480 --> 03:28:21,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Pinto, if we can continue with your line.

2794
03:28:21,981 --> 03:28:29,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, also, Dan, I have pictures here and up in West Medford, and I have pictures up here

2795
03:28:30,018 --> 03:28:31,539
[SPEAKER_14]: On the hillside in Medford.

2796
03:28:32,059 --> 03:28:34,021
[SPEAKER_14]: You have kiosks in front of residential homes.

2797
03:28:34,061 --> 03:28:34,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

2798
03:28:36,202 --> 03:28:40,585
[SPEAKER_20]: The earlier tonight, I know someone that spoke had mentioned a kiosk at 418 High Street.

2799
03:28:40,605 --> 03:28:41,686
[SPEAKER_20]: That's scheduled to be removed.

2800
03:28:41,766 --> 03:28:42,507
[SPEAKER_20]: That's going to be gone.

2801
03:28:43,788 --> 03:28:44,888
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure which one you're speaking of.

2802
03:28:44,908 --> 03:28:46,810
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this is across the street.

2803
03:28:47,930 --> 03:28:54,735
[SPEAKER_14]: This is on, these ones here are on Boston Avenue, opposite where Dunkin' Donuts and Nick's Pizza and all that.

2804
03:28:55,215 --> 03:28:56,877
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all residential on that side of the street.

2805
03:28:57,057 --> 03:28:58,298
[SPEAKER_14]: You have kiosks up and down the street.

2806
03:28:59,290 --> 03:29:01,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

2807
03:29:01,611 --> 03:29:07,534
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the exact area that the esteemed young lady, retiree, was talking about.

2808
03:29:07,554 --> 03:29:09,955
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where the tough students park their vehicles all day long.

2809
03:29:10,115 --> 03:29:10,956
[SPEAKER_11]: They're out of state plates.

2810
03:29:11,256 --> 03:29:13,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Maine, Ohio, California.

2811
03:29:13,317 --> 03:29:13,477
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2812
03:29:13,617 --> 03:29:19,080
[SPEAKER_14]: They park their vehicles on the opposite side of the garage, on the opposite side of the garage by the railroad tracks.

2813
03:29:19,140 --> 03:29:19,900
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where they park.

2814
03:29:20,421 --> 03:29:22,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, anyway.

2815
03:29:23,877 --> 03:29:25,878
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't put them in front of a residential.

2816
03:29:25,898 --> 03:29:28,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you go up to High Street, opposite St.

2817
03:29:28,200 --> 03:29:31,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Claude's, there's two residential homes there and there's a kiosk there next to an apartment.

2818
03:29:31,942 --> 03:29:34,364
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the one I told you, that's scheduled to be removed.

2819
03:29:34,384 --> 03:29:36,425
[SPEAKER_20]: But why did they go there in the first place?

2820
03:29:36,465 --> 03:29:40,088
[SPEAKER_20]: All the kiosks were placed based on the walker study that was done.

2821
03:29:40,408 --> 03:29:41,549
[SPEAKER_20]: Who was this walker study?

2822
03:29:41,569 --> 03:29:43,090
[SPEAKER_20]: And that was included in the RFP.

2823
03:29:43,690 --> 03:29:45,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Did the Council get a copy of this walker study?

2824
03:29:46,570 --> 03:29:47,671
[SPEAKER_14]: You got a copy of the walkers?

2825
03:29:48,191 --> 03:29:48,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information.

2826
03:29:49,152 --> 03:29:57,018
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually did not the walker study, but we actually got the overhead projection of every meter and the placement throughout the community at the committee of the whole meeting.

2827
03:29:57,318 --> 03:29:58,219
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on your disc.

2828
03:29:58,359 --> 03:29:59,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's on your disc.

2829
03:29:59,900 --> 03:30:06,365
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to take the kiosk, the one on Boston Avenue in front of the, in front of all the, that's not my decision.

2830
03:30:07,526 --> 03:30:09,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Who made the decision to take the ones off of high street?

2831
03:30:10,849 --> 03:30:11,189
[SPEAKER_14]: The city.

2832
03:30:12,630 --> 03:30:13,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Was the city here chief?

2833
03:30:13,531 --> 03:30:15,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you get rid of the ones on Boston Ave?

2834
03:30:17,002 --> 03:30:19,183
[SPEAKER_14]: From the Sacred Heart Church going down on the right-hand side.

2835
03:30:19,283 --> 03:30:27,269
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd have to look at it only because in some cases they were there because those are out-of-state students that are living in those homes.

2836
03:30:27,289 --> 03:30:28,509
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not owner-occupied.

2837
03:30:29,410 --> 03:30:30,851
[SPEAKER_21]: So it is a main drag.

2838
03:30:30,891 --> 03:30:32,832
[SPEAKER_21]: It does generate a lot of parking activity.

2839
03:30:32,852 --> 03:30:33,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, wait a minute.

2840
03:30:33,252 --> 03:30:34,573
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you going to make that determination?

2841
03:30:34,613 --> 03:30:37,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Does an owner-occupied person have to get a sticker so they don't have to pay?

2842
03:30:37,975 --> 03:30:38,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Sacred Heart Church.

2843
03:30:40,573 --> 03:30:42,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you referring to the Old Sacred Heart Church on Boston Ave?

2844
03:30:42,755 --> 03:30:43,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2845
03:30:43,476 --> 03:30:43,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

2846
03:30:43,917 --> 03:30:46,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm confused because that's now Tufts University.

2847
03:30:47,261 --> 03:30:50,624
[SPEAKER_14]: The Old Sacred Heart Church chief on that side going all the way down.

2848
03:30:51,285 --> 03:30:52,707
[SPEAKER_14]: There are apartments.

2849
03:30:53,147 --> 03:30:56,231
[SPEAKER_21]: There's only actually a few houses between Bellevue.

2850
03:30:57,067 --> 03:30:58,607
[SPEAKER_21]: Fairmont and University.

2851
03:30:59,027 --> 03:31:00,808
[SPEAKER_14]: You have two parking, you have two kiosks there.

2852
03:31:00,888 --> 03:31:07,869
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to look to see if they can be utilized in a better spot, but I know from University Avenue down to College Avenue will be needed.

2853
03:31:08,109 --> 03:31:23,413
[SPEAKER_14]: But you have two kiosks there, so if you're worried about students who aren't owner-occupiers, then why can't you give them stickers like you want to maybe give to the seniors so that way they can be identified and they can park there and they don't have to worry about going to a kiosk and putting in a meter.

2854
03:31:23,893 --> 03:31:25,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Which seniors are you talking about?

2855
03:31:28,133 --> 03:31:30,855
[SPEAKER_21]: As I said earlier, I have to look at the location and see what the situation is.

2856
03:31:31,075 --> 03:31:31,936
[SPEAKER_21]: What is he talking about, this guy?

2857
03:31:31,956 --> 03:31:32,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you listen to what I'm saying?

2858
03:31:32,957 --> 03:31:33,457
[SPEAKER_14]: You said the seniors.

2859
03:31:33,477 --> 03:31:34,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I said like the seniors, like he wants to give the seniors.

2860
03:31:34,718 --> 03:31:36,459
[SPEAKER_14]: You're talking about the old Sacred Heart Church.

2861
03:31:36,519 --> 03:31:36,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Forget it.

2862
03:31:36,840 --> 03:31:37,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Jesus.

2863
03:31:37,500 --> 03:31:38,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, you're losing it.

2864
03:31:39,542 --> 03:31:39,982
[SPEAKER_24]: You have?

2865
03:31:41,123 --> 03:31:42,784
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor Penter, if I could suggest.

2866
03:31:42,864 --> 03:31:43,104
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2867
03:31:43,144 --> 03:31:45,826
[SPEAKER_24]: We've spoken at a rather lengthy time.

2868
03:31:46,026 --> 03:31:47,307
[SPEAKER_24]: Wait a minute, this is very important.

2869
03:31:47,608 --> 03:31:48,108
[SPEAKER_14]: You have kiosks.

2870
03:31:48,128 --> 03:31:50,510
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you going to identify these kiosks at night when it's dark out?

2871
03:31:52,151 --> 03:31:52,751
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no signage.

2872
03:31:52,772 --> 03:31:52,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Flashlight.

2873
03:31:53,012 --> 03:31:53,632
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no lights.

2874
03:31:53,672 --> 03:31:54,173
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing.

2875
03:31:55,049 --> 03:32:09,921
[SPEAKER_14]: So if somebody's coming into the square, somebody wants to park in this parking lot at the end of the ring road, how are they going to see these two little kiosks in the back of the building that aren't lit up at all, and the people have a huge 150 car parking lot without anything in it?

2876
03:32:10,982 --> 03:32:11,742
[SPEAKER_14]: How are we going to do that?

2877
03:32:11,922 --> 03:32:17,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, how is that equity compared to a small little businessman who's got a sign in front of a store or a kiosk?

2878
03:32:19,022 --> 03:32:21,063
[SPEAKER_21]: Just keep in mind, 7 p.m.

2879
03:32:21,083 --> 03:32:24,085
[SPEAKER_21]: is the cutoff, so I know what you're saying, 4 o'clock, it's dark out.

2880
03:32:24,145 --> 03:32:24,886
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand that.

2881
03:32:25,746 --> 03:32:27,287
[SPEAKER_14]: So how do you do this?

2882
03:32:27,307 --> 03:32:29,129
[SPEAKER_14]: These things don't even get illuminated.

2883
03:32:29,149 --> 03:32:36,293
[SPEAKER_14]: So if somebody decides to come to the square, and they're four or five spaces away from a kiosk, what are they going to do?

2884
03:32:36,494 --> 03:32:38,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they going to get out of the car and go looking for a kiosk?

2885
03:32:40,342 --> 03:32:41,602
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not illuminated.

2886
03:32:41,642 --> 03:32:44,763
[SPEAKER_21]: At that hour, they're probably not going to park in that parking lot.

2887
03:32:44,803 --> 03:32:45,923
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care about this parking lot.

2888
03:32:45,943 --> 03:32:47,624
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just an example of one spot.

2889
03:32:47,904 --> 03:32:48,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Take the other spots.

2890
03:32:48,984 --> 03:32:50,184
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a small little peak.

2891
03:32:51,224 --> 03:32:53,565
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no light in the top that goes along or anything.

2892
03:32:53,585 --> 03:32:55,985
[SPEAKER_14]: You said the thing is run by solar.

2893
03:32:56,025 --> 03:32:57,806
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm assuming it has a battery backup.

2894
03:32:57,846 --> 03:33:00,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Why can't you have some kind of a light on it?

2895
03:33:01,086 --> 03:33:03,707
[SPEAKER_14]: So people don't feel like they're getting sucked in if they get a ticket.

2896
03:33:06,036 --> 03:33:13,541
[SPEAKER_21]: But I also think that, as was stated earlier, we have to give people a little more credit than what's being given right now.

2897
03:33:13,621 --> 03:33:26,410
[SPEAKER_14]: How long do you think it's going to take, Chief, the people of this city of Medford who don't watch the council meetings, don't have a computer, or don't utilize it, don't read the newspaper, to get themselves acclimated before they start getting tickets all over the place?

2898
03:33:28,692 --> 03:33:29,012
[SPEAKER_21]: How long?

2899
03:33:29,112 --> 03:33:30,893
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the learning process will be very quick.

2900
03:33:32,074 --> 03:33:35,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if the learning process is quick, maybe the revenues will be down.

2901
03:33:35,466 --> 03:33:39,088
[SPEAKER_14]: And if the revenues are down, that's gonna mean businesses are in trouble because people aren't gonna do it.

2902
03:33:39,268 --> 03:33:44,130
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we could have been the only community around that did not have paid parking.

2903
03:33:44,270 --> 03:33:45,970
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what that would have meant for business people?

2904
03:33:46,290 --> 03:33:48,451
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what that would have done to the climate of this community?

2905
03:33:48,732 --> 03:33:53,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Just have enforcement for the hours that are there, whether it's a half hour or an hour or whatever it might be.

2906
03:33:53,574 --> 03:33:54,634
[SPEAKER_14]: You could have a self-medfit.

2907
03:33:54,854 --> 03:33:59,956
[SPEAKER_14]: You have 15 minute, you have a half hour, you have one hour and two hour parking on blocks of stores.

2908
03:34:00,236 --> 03:34:01,637
[SPEAKER_14]: How does that make any sense?

2909
03:34:03,509 --> 03:34:05,490
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, how did they get to these numbers?

2910
03:34:05,851 --> 03:34:10,914
[SPEAKER_14]: One business has 15 minutes, another one has free parking for a half hour, another one's got a half hour, another one's got an hour.

2911
03:34:11,094 --> 03:34:14,617
[SPEAKER_21]: But that goes back to what I said earlier, making exemptions as we go along.

2912
03:34:14,637 --> 03:34:16,939
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like we can't cater to every whim.

2913
03:34:17,459 --> 03:34:17,819
[SPEAKER_14]: But Chief.

2914
03:34:17,839 --> 03:34:18,560
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's what happened.

2915
03:34:18,580 --> 03:34:20,741
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why you see the inconsistent timelines.

2916
03:34:21,362 --> 03:34:27,766
[SPEAKER_24]: You've exceeded your time limit rather abundantly, and perhaps it would be.

2917
03:34:27,966 --> 03:34:29,748
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a very important issue, as you know.

2918
03:34:30,028 --> 03:34:30,548
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that.

2919
03:34:31,209 --> 03:34:32,850
[SPEAKER_24]: You've become rather repetitive

2920
03:34:33,366 --> 03:34:35,207
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think so.

2921
03:34:35,967 --> 03:34:38,588
[SPEAKER_11]: In Medford square, how many actual spots are there?

2922
03:34:39,329 --> 03:34:45,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the Councillor was on when they built the garage that actually fell apart and got destroyed.

2923
03:34:46,496 --> 03:34:48,877
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it was shoddy construction back then or what the deal was.

2924
03:34:48,917 --> 03:34:50,777
[SPEAKER_11]: But how many spots are actually in Medford Square now?

2925
03:34:50,797 --> 03:34:52,097
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't build that garage.

2926
03:34:52,197 --> 03:34:53,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you were on the council when you approved that garage.

2927
03:34:53,798 --> 03:34:56,298
[SPEAKER_14]: It was your friend, the mayor, that didn't help the poor guy that fell through the roof.

2928
03:34:56,318 --> 03:34:57,259
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was built before he.

2929
03:34:57,279 --> 03:34:59,019
[SPEAKER_14]: The poor guy that fell through the roof that worked at the city.

2930
03:34:59,059 --> 03:34:59,419
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

2931
03:34:59,439 --> 03:35:00,999
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor never went once to see him.

2932
03:35:01,099 --> 03:35:01,880
[SPEAKER_14]: You built the garage.

2933
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:02,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Never went to see him.

2934
03:35:02,980 --> 03:35:03,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

2935
03:35:03,960 --> 03:35:07,241
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as the total number of spots, it's lucky he's alive.

2936
03:35:07,681 --> 03:35:08,081
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

2937
03:35:08,461 --> 03:35:10,562
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as the total number of spots, I don't know the exact number.

2938
03:35:10,582 --> 03:35:12,342
[SPEAKER_20]: I know there's 36 kiosks and what.

2939
03:35:12,542 --> 03:35:14,903
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you let the chief know the number tomorrow and I'll be in touch with him?

2940
03:35:15,483 --> 03:35:15,863
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

2941
03:35:16,513 --> 03:35:17,013
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2942
03:35:19,434 --> 03:35:22,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Penter, if you could wrap it up, please.

2943
03:35:23,255 --> 03:35:36,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to move that we keep this in a full-blown committee on behalf of the taxpayers of this community for the purposes of having a... There is no paper to keep on the floor.

2944
03:35:36,419 --> 03:35:37,560
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll make a paper on the floor.

2945
03:35:37,620 --> 03:35:38,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Make this the paper on the floor.

2946
03:35:39,440 --> 03:35:41,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councillor Camuso.

2947
03:35:42,241 --> 03:35:44,102
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll yield to the gentleman, but...

2948
03:35:45,278 --> 03:35:46,418
[SPEAKER_11]: His motion is redundant.

2949
03:35:46,498 --> 03:35:50,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Vice-President, I'm sorry, Councilor Caravaglio already has that.

2950
03:35:50,539 --> 03:35:50,799
[SPEAKER_11]: 60 days.

2951
03:35:50,999 --> 03:35:51,479
[SPEAKER_14]: What's he want?

2952
03:35:51,499 --> 03:35:51,979
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't hear him.

2953
03:35:52,019 --> 03:35:53,219
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you say, Rick?

2954
03:35:53,299 --> 03:35:53,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

2955
03:35:53,780 --> 03:35:57,700
[SPEAKER_16]: I think two or three weeks ago, we asked for 60 days, if they would come back.

2956
03:35:57,720 --> 03:35:59,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't want to wait 60 days.

2957
03:35:59,040 --> 03:36:01,621
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to leave it open, so in case we have another opportunity.

2958
03:36:01,681 --> 03:36:04,001
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to give them some time to get it done.

2959
03:36:04,321 --> 03:36:06,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we can talk about what took place here tonight.

2960
03:36:06,222 --> 03:36:07,742
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no paper before us.

2961
03:36:07,902 --> 03:36:08,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, then we move.

2962
03:36:08,682 --> 03:36:09,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Move the paper.

2963
03:36:09,222 --> 03:36:10,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Move the conversation.

2964
03:36:10,183 --> 03:36:11,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't come up for 90 days.

2965
03:36:11,163 --> 03:36:12,343
[SPEAKER_14]: You can move the conversation.

2966
03:36:12,943 --> 03:36:14,244
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to beat you with the rules, Councillor.

2967
03:36:14,404 --> 03:36:16,044
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, Councillor Knight.

2968
03:36:16,064 --> 03:36:16,825
[SPEAKER_26]: It's going to be a long year.

2969
03:36:16,845 --> 03:36:25,148
[SPEAKER_26]: If I may be so bold to suggest, please do, that if certain individuals want a paper, they file a resolution.

2970
03:36:25,428 --> 03:36:26,709
[SPEAKER_26]: And we can talk about it next week.

2971
03:36:26,729 --> 03:36:29,930
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, then perhaps we'll wrap up this discussion now.

2972
03:36:30,511 --> 03:36:35,253
[SPEAKER_24]: And we'll invite one of our beloved colleagues to submit a proper paper.

2973
03:36:35,273 --> 03:36:36,293
[SPEAKER_16]: What about the gentleman?

2974
03:36:36,693 --> 03:36:39,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Caraviello has been waiting patiently.

2975
03:36:42,177 --> 03:36:42,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it Dan?

2976
03:36:42,577 --> 03:36:44,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, sir.

2977
03:36:44,378 --> 03:36:44,898
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a question for you.

2978
03:36:45,979 --> 03:36:50,321
[SPEAKER_16]: When Counselor Penta was asking you about the appeal process.

2979
03:36:51,262 --> 03:36:52,482
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I have.

2980
03:36:52,542 --> 03:36:53,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I didn't hear you correctly.

2981
03:36:55,104 --> 03:36:59,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you say that if there's an overabundance of appeals, that you can step in and?

2982
03:36:59,906 --> 03:37:01,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, sir, yeah.

2983
03:37:02,407 --> 03:37:02,988
[SPEAKER_16]: You can do that?

2984
03:37:03,188 --> 03:37:03,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2985
03:37:04,978 --> 03:37:07,239
[SPEAKER_16]: You said you'd recommend it.

2986
03:37:07,299 --> 03:37:10,602
[SPEAKER_16]: You said you'd be able to, if there's an overabundance of appeals, we could do that.

2987
03:37:10,862 --> 03:37:12,663
[SPEAKER_20]: You would step in and take over the process?

2988
03:37:13,724 --> 03:37:15,205
[SPEAKER_20]: We would help supplement the process.

2989
03:37:15,325 --> 03:37:27,773
[SPEAKER_20]: I still think it's important that there's an appeal, that they can go to an appeal process that appears to be outside of our office, because when they come to our office to appeal, and if it gets denied, then they can be, well, they wrote the ticket and they, even though it would be independent.

2990
03:37:27,813 --> 03:37:30,155
[SPEAKER_16]: What would you consider an overabundance, what percentage?

2991
03:37:33,668 --> 03:37:34,868
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to throw a number at that.

2992
03:37:34,929 --> 03:37:40,352
[SPEAKER_16]: If 50% of the tickets are overturned, you would step in and say, I'm going to bring my own guy to do this?

2993
03:37:40,992 --> 03:37:46,616
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think it wouldn't be based on how many are overturned as opposed to how many are actually appealed.

2994
03:37:46,736 --> 03:37:47,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually being appealed?

2995
03:37:47,937 --> 03:37:48,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

2996
03:37:49,038 --> 03:37:54,962
[SPEAKER_16]: So I say at some point, you could step in and take the process away from us, if that's what I understood.

2997
03:37:56,056 --> 03:37:58,018
[SPEAKER_24]: I think point of information.

2998
03:38:00,221 --> 03:38:03,285
[SPEAKER_11]: As much as a council, I think we want to take it out of city hall.

2999
03:38:03,826 --> 03:38:07,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to put it back in their hands where they're right on the ticket.

3000
03:38:07,570 --> 03:38:12,536
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a conflict of interest on the city hall side, there's a conflict of interest on the vendor that's making money.

3001
03:38:16,512 --> 03:38:17,072
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree.

3002
03:38:17,233 --> 03:38:21,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, because I think it's more of an appearance issue because we wouldn't actually adjudicate.

3003
03:38:22,276 --> 03:38:26,038
[SPEAKER_11]: People will be saying you're only upholding the ticket because it's right.

3004
03:38:26,058 --> 03:38:27,559
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think there needs to be going in your pocket.

3005
03:38:27,659 --> 03:38:31,321
[SPEAKER_20]: There needs to be a, a step beyond us.

3006
03:38:33,063 --> 03:38:34,884
[SPEAKER_20]: I wasn't sure when you said that, but here's your right.

3007
03:38:38,010 --> 03:38:46,397
[SPEAKER_20]: We would have the ability and willingness to help supplement the appeal process to try to alleviate appeals that have to go to City Hall.

3008
03:38:46,417 --> 03:38:55,644
[SPEAKER_20]: I would not recommend not allowing that process to still be there for appearance's sake to make sure people feel they're getting a fair shake on that.

3009
03:39:01,948 --> 03:39:02,149
Thank you.

3010
03:39:02,529 --> 03:39:02,909
Thank you.

3011
03:39:03,229 --> 03:39:03,490
Thank you.

3012
03:39:07,006 --> 03:39:08,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for that.

3013
03:39:10,088 --> 03:39:10,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Quick question.

3014
03:39:10,528 --> 03:39:14,111
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to go back to what Adam brought up about loading zones and deliveries.

3015
03:39:14,471 --> 03:39:15,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

3016
03:39:16,012 --> 03:39:16,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight, yes.

3017
03:39:20,335 --> 03:39:36,185
[SPEAKER_17]: A major part of deliveries in all these business districts, West Medford, Haines Square, Medford Square, all the areas that now have kiosks in them, which are the business districts,

3018
03:39:38,363 --> 03:39:40,064
[SPEAKER_17]: 90% of us depend on deliveries.

3019
03:39:41,845 --> 03:39:43,207
[SPEAKER_17]: There's never any parking.

3020
03:39:43,227 --> 03:39:44,368
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have any loading zones.

3021
03:39:44,428 --> 03:39:47,330
[SPEAKER_17]: I brought this up at one of our meetings, I think, Leo, correct?

3022
03:39:47,991 --> 03:39:52,534
[SPEAKER_17]: And Chief Stack, I guess I have to refer you to since Little League Baseball.

3023
03:39:52,815 --> 03:39:57,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, what's going to happen to these?

3024
03:39:57,218 --> 03:40:03,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we going to end up as a business owner with a surcharge from these companies that are getting whacked with tickets and so forth?

3025
03:40:03,444 --> 03:40:06,086
[SPEAKER_17]: Because they double park, triple park, they park everywhere.

3026
03:40:07,300 --> 03:40:08,400
[SPEAKER_17]: We've all come across it.

3027
03:40:08,441 --> 03:40:12,722
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't the first time it's ever come up.

3028
03:40:13,283 --> 03:40:15,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's patrolling that and how that's going to go.

3029
03:40:18,405 --> 03:40:24,168
[SPEAKER_24]: It's an enforcement issue that maybe the chief can take a stab at it.

3030
03:40:24,208 --> 03:40:30,070
[SPEAKER_21]: But I know that the last time we talked about this, I mean, the idea is that, you know, we know the businesses have to have their deliveries.

3031
03:40:30,470 --> 03:40:33,172
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to try not to interfere with them.

3032
03:40:33,912 --> 03:40:36,093
[SPEAKER_21]: I do have an issue when they double pack on Salem street,

3033
03:40:36,669 --> 03:40:41,192
[SPEAKER_21]: because I see collisions happening, because people have to swerve into another lane.

3034
03:40:43,233 --> 03:40:49,797
[SPEAKER_21]: But I have not received numerous complaints about the loading trucks, and I don't anticipate that they would be ticketed.

3035
03:40:50,677 --> 03:40:54,860
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a location that I thought we could do something, maybe on River Street.

3036
03:40:55,861 --> 03:40:58,102
[SPEAKER_21]: Probably can't, because the buses have to make the turn there.

3037
03:40:58,142 --> 03:41:06,407
[SPEAKER_21]: But we're certainly not going to interfere with the loading and deliveries, unless someone's abusing it, and they're going to be there for an hour.

3038
03:41:06,920 --> 03:41:16,104
[SPEAKER_21]: I have great respect for the, the, the, the men and women who drive the tractor trailers and make these deliveries, how they can get in and out of tight spots and how quickly they can make their deliveries.

3039
03:41:16,364 --> 03:41:23,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, so the hope is, and I know you do, and I understand what you're saying, but we've entered a different phase here now.

3040
03:41:24,228 --> 03:41:25,769
[SPEAKER_17]: This is out of your control.

3041
03:41:25,889 --> 03:41:27,810
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not totally out of the police department's control.

3042
03:41:27,830 --> 03:41:32,792
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a different company coming in here who's now the enforcement company, who's the writing agent.

3043
03:41:33,872 --> 03:41:38,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they're enforcing the time, the time limits.

3044
03:41:38,895 --> 03:41:52,245
[SPEAKER_24]: If I can just point out from the chair that it was quite explicit in the contract that the enforcement of the parking and traffic regulations of the city of Medford, uh, the purview of Metro police department.

3045
03:41:52,305 --> 03:41:52,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Well,

3046
03:41:56,808 --> 03:42:00,690
[SPEAKER_21]: The goal is that they will be following our direction on something like loading trucks.

3047
03:42:00,750 --> 03:42:10,395
[SPEAKER_17]: A big 18 wheel pulls into a bus stop like they do all the time and delivering 20 barrels to the liquor store next to me and 10 barrels to me.

3048
03:42:11,055 --> 03:42:15,657
[SPEAKER_17]: With these guys swooping in because this is how they make their income.

3049
03:42:16,338 --> 03:42:22,281
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to be writing them up and then now we're going to be forced to have set delivery times and everything.

3050
03:42:22,701 --> 03:42:26,583
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I mean, that would be great if we could have set delivery times, but we know that they can't.

3051
03:42:26,884 --> 03:42:32,547
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe that's a better conversation to be had between you and the chief rather than in a public venue.

3052
03:42:33,388 --> 03:42:33,808
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3053
03:42:35,229 --> 03:42:47,276
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought this is a public venue for business in general, and this is a forum to see how the chairman of Congress did such a bad job at doing this.

3054
03:42:51,317 --> 03:42:54,698
[SPEAKER_17]: The business owners, this is a concern for deliverance.

3055
03:42:56,419 --> 03:42:57,099
[SPEAKER_15]: We understand.

3056
03:43:01,161 --> 03:43:04,242
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the question is pertinent, because you just mentioned Salem Street.

3057
03:43:04,722 --> 03:43:09,544
[SPEAKER_14]: And if Salem Street, which is a smaller, maybe in width of a street, as compared to other locations.

3058
03:43:09,564 --> 03:43:13,146
[SPEAKER_14]: But every one of these businesses, at some point in time, has to have some kind of delivery.

3059
03:43:13,786 --> 03:43:14,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

3060
03:43:15,447 --> 03:43:17,808
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I don't understand is,

3061
03:43:19,587 --> 03:43:25,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Why should these republic people even be giving those businesses citation?

3062
03:43:27,334 --> 03:43:28,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think that's what Mr. Carroll is asking.

3063
03:43:28,776 --> 03:43:30,057
[SPEAKER_21]: Why should they be giving citations?

3064
03:43:30,077 --> 03:43:34,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, if you're saying the other ones is going to, all they're going to be doing is giving, what, tickets?

3065
03:43:35,402 --> 03:43:36,383
[SPEAKER_21]: Just the tickets for the time?

3066
03:43:36,543 --> 03:43:39,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Why would they be giving a ticket to someone who might be making a delivery?

3067
03:43:39,406 --> 03:43:40,126
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what the question is.

3068
03:43:40,146 --> 03:43:41,748
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't anticipate that that will happen.

3069
03:43:42,469 --> 03:43:42,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, OK.

3070
03:43:43,168 --> 03:43:43,468
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't?

3071
03:43:43,748 --> 03:43:43,888
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

3072
03:43:44,189 --> 03:43:44,449
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

3073
03:43:44,869 --> 03:43:46,570
[SPEAKER_24]: There was no desire to have a disruption of business.

3074
03:43:46,590 --> 03:43:51,393
[SPEAKER_21]: All I can say is you'll probably find a police officer giving that ticket if that truck's there for two hours.

3075
03:43:51,553 --> 03:43:51,793
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

3076
03:43:52,294 --> 03:43:55,275
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, like I said, a lot of these deliveries are done very quickly.

3077
03:43:55,315 --> 03:43:56,716
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last part of the question is this.

3078
03:43:56,776 --> 03:44:00,759
[SPEAKER_14]: If I get a ticket and I have it appealed and I lose my appeal, can I take this to district court?

3079
03:44:01,579 --> 03:44:02,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Where does this appeal go?

3080
03:44:03,060 --> 03:44:04,721
[SPEAKER_14]: You have the option.

3081
03:44:04,741 --> 03:44:08,263
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the next logical, what's the next process after that if you lose your appeal?

3082
03:44:09,004 --> 03:44:09,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Court.

3083
03:44:09,844 --> 03:44:10,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it district court?

3084
03:44:10,545 --> 03:44:10,985
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it is.

3085
03:44:13,913 --> 03:44:16,155
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have one question for the chair to the chief.

3086
03:44:16,635 --> 03:44:17,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Please.

3087
03:44:18,356 --> 03:44:18,557
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

3088
03:44:18,577 --> 03:44:24,901
[SPEAKER_17]: If a vehicle is illegally parked, the public cannot give them the citation.

3089
03:44:26,743 --> 03:44:29,945
[SPEAKER_21]: No, if a vehicle is illegally parked, they can't give the citation.

3090
03:44:30,225 --> 03:44:31,466
[SPEAKER_21]: It's part of the enforcement.

3091
03:44:31,506 --> 03:44:37,871
[SPEAKER_17]: So if it's a delivery vehicle parked in a bus stop, which I think is illegal, that's pretty defiant, too.

3092
03:44:38,011 --> 03:44:38,832
[SPEAKER_17]: $100, set by the MBTA.

3093
03:44:42,869 --> 03:44:45,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Is the Republican that ticket, or do we have to wait for the Metro Police?

3094
03:44:45,751 --> 03:44:46,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Chief.

3095
03:44:47,052 --> 03:44:48,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Councilor Caravaglio.

3096
03:44:49,654 --> 03:44:55,258
[SPEAKER_16]: The Republican people are telling them they will not be tagging in the bus stops.

3097
03:44:55,318 --> 03:44:56,159
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a tease problem.

3098
03:44:57,059 --> 03:44:58,160
[SPEAKER_16]: No, they can tag.

3099
03:44:58,560 --> 03:45:02,163
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what they've been telling the businesses in the square.

3100
03:45:02,563 --> 03:45:03,824
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going to tag you in the bus.

3101
03:45:04,145 --> 03:45:05,666
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what the ambassadors were saying in the square.

3102
03:45:06,748 --> 03:45:07,569
[SPEAKER_20]: They misspoke.

3103
03:45:07,649 --> 03:45:13,972
[SPEAKER_20]: I've spoken to as many businesses as I can and we would tag in a bus stop if someone was parked illegally.

3104
03:45:14,072 --> 03:45:14,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

3105
03:45:14,733 --> 03:45:16,214
[SPEAKER_16]: You should make that known to your ambassadors.

3106
03:45:17,274 --> 03:45:17,815
[SPEAKER_20]: I will let them know.

3107
03:45:17,835 --> 03:45:18,555
[SPEAKER_20]: They're here to help out.

3108
03:45:18,975 --> 03:45:22,417
[SPEAKER_20]: Their primary goal this week is to help educate people on the kiosks.

3109
03:45:22,497 --> 03:45:24,078
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been like three degrees out there.

3110
03:45:24,158 --> 03:45:27,040
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of a bad week to get them out there this week.

3111
03:45:27,180 --> 03:45:31,482
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the parking ambassadors' primary goal this week has been to help train people on the kiosks and assist them with that.

3112
03:45:31,542 --> 03:45:33,484
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not familiar with the ordinances.

3113
03:45:34,901 --> 03:45:40,405
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll clarify to them to not answer questions on enforcement procedures because they're not our enforcement staff.

3114
03:45:41,106 --> 03:45:42,407
[SPEAKER_14]: What if a car, wait a minute, strike that.

3115
03:45:42,427 --> 03:45:48,171
[SPEAKER_14]: What if a car is illegally parked and the delivery has to be made, which forces the delivery truck to go up in the street?

3116
03:45:48,671 --> 03:45:50,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that mean the delivery truck is now going to get the ticket?

3117
03:45:54,174 --> 03:45:58,175
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, if the vehicle is double parked, then they would be in violation of an ordinance.

3118
03:45:58,215 --> 03:46:07,478
[SPEAKER_14]: No, if the vehicle, the delivery truck could not make his delivery because the car that was parked where the delivery truck was going to go is illegally parked or over parked.

3119
03:46:07,758 --> 03:46:09,419
[SPEAKER_14]: So that forces the truck out into the street.

3120
03:46:09,859 --> 03:46:13,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that truck going to get a ticket because of that car that's illegally parked?

3121
03:46:14,220 --> 03:46:14,600
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

3122
03:46:14,720 --> 03:46:16,261
[SPEAKER_20]: And what I'd say to add to that is,

3123
03:46:17,340 --> 03:46:20,962
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not doing our job if there's a car sitting in that loading zone that prevents a delivery truck.

3124
03:46:20,982 --> 03:46:22,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but you only have two people to go around the city.

3125
03:46:23,604 --> 03:46:25,065
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't be at every place all at once.

3126
03:46:25,085 --> 03:46:25,845
[SPEAKER_14]: That's impossible.

3127
03:46:28,947 --> 03:46:29,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Counselor.

3128
03:46:30,228 --> 03:46:37,752
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand your question, and I respectfully disagree that we can actually effectively enforce the loading zones without having to be in the square at all times.

3129
03:46:38,313 --> 03:46:42,735
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's by doing proper enforcement throughout the city and tagging those people that do the violations.

3130
03:46:42,976 --> 03:46:44,737
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yes.

3131
03:46:46,616 --> 03:46:49,077
[SPEAKER_20]: And we would take consideration into a situation like that.

3132
03:46:49,117 --> 03:46:59,162
[SPEAKER_20]: If we approach that, our enforcement officer would go into the business and try to identify what's going on, ask the delivery driver to move, if possible, and give them the benefit of the doubt.

3133
03:47:02,824 --> 03:47:11,509
[SPEAKER_14]: So when the rubbish truck goes down the street and parks in the middle of the street because there's cars parked on the right, and they're collecting the rubbish off the sidewalk, they will or they won't get a ticket, the rubbish trucks?

3134
03:47:12,990 --> 03:47:14,811
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going to ticket any rubbish trucks.

3135
03:47:16,613 --> 03:47:25,396
[SPEAKER_20]: And, uh, uh, councilman Camuso to answer previous questions so we can avoid a phone call.

3136
03:47:25,416 --> 03:47:28,798
[SPEAKER_20]: There's just under 600 spaces in Metro square, just under.

3137
03:47:31,459 --> 03:47:32,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

3138
03:47:32,819 --> 03:47:34,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Just, just to finish up on that.

3139
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:41,883
[SPEAKER_21]: My recommendation is that the delivery truck, unless they're abusing the opportunity will not be tagged for the violation.

3140
03:47:43,243 --> 03:47:47,625
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, until we can sit down and designate loading zones, but we just don't have enough geography.

3141
03:47:47,645 --> 03:47:52,686
[SPEAKER_21]: If we're trying to create parking spaces for consumers, we'd be taking it away from them.

3142
03:47:52,786 --> 03:47:58,888
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we can accommodate them on the street and if they have to double park and it's temporary, we can work with them.

3143
03:48:00,268 --> 03:48:06,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much for all your help tonight, Chief, and thank you to the representatives of Republican Parking.

3144
03:48:08,291 --> 03:48:08,571
[SPEAKER_24]: Ma'am?

3145
03:48:09,951 --> 03:48:10,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Ma'am?

3146
03:48:11,112 --> 03:48:11,692
[SPEAKER_24]: Very briefly.

3147
03:48:12,712 --> 03:48:20,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say is, it seems to me, I called my house to find out if people were watching this.

3148
03:48:20,899 --> 03:48:24,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I was told is they don't know any more now than they knew before.

3149
03:48:25,623 --> 03:48:32,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I am suggesting, and Mr. President, are you listening?

3150
03:48:32,949 --> 03:48:35,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I just want to make sure.

3151
03:48:35,531 --> 03:48:40,335
[SPEAKER_02]: What I am suggesting, just from what you've heard here tonight,

3152
03:48:41,848 --> 03:49:04,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible, because all those folks that are out there listening, looking at television and hearing all of this, and they don't know anymore than they knew before, is it possible for the city council to have, or would it make sense, because I thought I heard this man saying, in a year, if things weren't going, or whatever, that they could cancel,

3153
03:49:05,560 --> 03:49:21,850
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, is it possible for you to do or the chief to have a robo-call, one of those 411 calls, have a public meeting here, get the call out there?

3154
03:49:21,870 --> 03:49:24,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I get them all the time for everything.

3155
03:49:24,172 --> 03:49:32,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So have a public meeting and let all the people come here with their questions because I'm sure that

3156
03:49:36,933 --> 03:49:37,333
[SPEAKER_02]: For what?

3157
03:49:40,134 --> 03:49:40,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And?

3158
03:49:47,377 --> 03:49:47,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And?

3159
03:49:58,162 --> 03:50:04,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying that you can't have a public meeting unless the mayor gives permission to do that.

3160
03:50:07,378 --> 03:50:08,318
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it sounds like.

3161
03:50:11,019 --> 03:50:12,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.

3162
03:50:14,261 --> 03:50:18,182
[SPEAKER_02]: We have how many citizens here in Medford?

3163
03:50:18,723 --> 03:50:21,464
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't understand what is going on because

3164
03:50:23,003 --> 03:50:28,029
[SPEAKER_02]: The cart is before the horse.

3165
03:50:28,649 --> 03:50:36,239
[SPEAKER_02]: This should have been the kind of meeting that should have been held with these people to come and explain everything.

3166
03:50:36,639 --> 03:50:38,701
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even have anything in writing.

3167
03:50:39,022 --> 03:50:40,163
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have anything in print.

3168
03:50:40,243 --> 03:50:41,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

3169
03:50:41,785 --> 03:50:46,827
[SPEAKER_02]: what this program is all about except that I know that these kiosks are on the street.

3170
03:50:47,567 --> 03:50:59,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just seems to me, and Councilor Knight, I know you're new, I know you're young, but you gotta know where you're coming from to know where you're going.

3171
03:50:59,171 --> 03:51:00,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So to think that you

3172
03:51:01,500 --> 03:51:03,322
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

3173
03:51:03,422 --> 03:51:07,745
[SPEAKER_26]: I would certainly agree that history is important, but history is history, and it's time for us to move on now.

3174
03:51:07,765 --> 03:51:08,226
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

3175
03:51:08,246 --> 03:51:09,547
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know the history, though.

3176
03:51:09,567 --> 03:51:10,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3177
03:51:10,488 --> 03:51:11,849
[SPEAKER_02]: We always need to know the history.

3178
03:51:11,889 --> 03:51:12,710
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, and I knew the history.

3179
03:51:12,770 --> 03:51:13,711
[SPEAKER_24]: I was involved from day one.

3180
03:51:13,871 --> 03:51:15,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

3181
03:51:16,033 --> 03:51:17,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying that's not possible.

3182
03:51:17,734 --> 03:51:18,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're saying?

3183
03:51:18,575 --> 03:51:19,456
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that?

3184
03:51:19,836 --> 03:51:20,837
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not saying that.

3185
03:51:21,137 --> 03:51:25,301
[SPEAKER_24]: And the council is going to receive further resolutions for next week.

3186
03:51:25,321 --> 03:51:26,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it on next week.

3187
03:51:26,922 --> 03:51:27,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

3188
03:51:27,523 --> 03:51:28,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Pinter.

3189
03:51:33,218 --> 03:51:36,079
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, that will conclude this discussion tonight.

3190
03:51:36,860 --> 03:51:41,582
[SPEAKER_24]: The records tabled December 16th.

3191
03:51:45,463 --> 03:51:49,045
[SPEAKER_24]: We have one paper on the hand of the clerk received under suspension.

3192
03:51:50,466 --> 03:52:02,231
[SPEAKER_24]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Metro City Council adjourn in memory of the late Governor's Counselor, Michael J. Callahan, fourth anniversary of his death.

3193
03:52:02,807 --> 03:52:05,412
[SPEAKER_24]: Fourth anniversary of his death.

3194
03:52:05,572 --> 03:52:06,935
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

3195
03:52:07,416 --> 03:52:09,881
[SPEAKER_26]: As many of you are aware, Michael Callahan and I were dear friends.

3196
03:52:10,482 --> 03:52:13,127
[SPEAKER_26]: And four years ago this evening, he passed away.

3197
03:52:14,095 --> 03:52:20,657
[SPEAKER_26]: Michael Callahan was a public servant for 48 years working in the federal and state and local government.

3198
03:52:21,257 --> 03:52:25,599
[SPEAKER_26]: He was the consumer commissioner for the Medford Consumer Commission from 1978 until his passing.

3199
03:52:25,939 --> 03:52:31,881
[SPEAKER_26]: He was a four-term governor's counselor, and he was also chief steward at the National Association of Government Employees.

3200
03:52:32,561 --> 03:52:37,243
[SPEAKER_26]: Michael is sorely and sadly missed, Mr. President, just this past year.

3201
03:52:37,923 --> 03:52:40,324
[SPEAKER_26]: He was honored up at Wrights Pond for his work

3202
03:52:40,754 --> 03:52:46,378
[SPEAKER_26]: in protecting Wrights Pond and ensuring that that location was not turned into condominium complexes in the early to late 80s.

3203
03:52:46,999 --> 03:52:54,985
[SPEAKER_26]: So, Mr. President, I think it's fitting that on this evening and this anniversary of the death of such a great man that the City Council adjourns in his memory.

3204
03:52:56,186 --> 03:52:59,068
[SPEAKER_24]: I sat on his knee when he was dressed as Santa Claus.

3205
03:53:01,169 --> 03:53:01,810
[SPEAKER_24]: The records.

3206
03:53:02,571 --> 03:53:03,611
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Councillor Penta.

3207
03:53:04,592 --> 03:53:04,952
[SPEAKER_24]: Please.

3208
03:53:06,233 --> 03:53:06,514
[SPEAKER_24]: Chief.

3209
03:53:08,175 --> 03:53:08,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief.

3210
03:53:09,145 --> 03:53:11,807
[SPEAKER_14]: We chief question.

3211
03:53:13,048 --> 03:53:13,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you go back?

3212
03:53:14,329 --> 03:53:16,010
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish the guy from Republic was still here.

3213
03:53:16,331 --> 03:53:18,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you go back and ask them to change these things here?

3214
03:53:18,512 --> 03:53:21,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the residential permit needs to be explained.

3215
03:53:22,055 --> 03:53:23,736
[SPEAKER_14]: It's $10 and it's $3.

3216
03:53:23,796 --> 03:53:25,538
[SPEAKER_14]: If you go online to get it, that's $10.

3217
03:53:26,138 --> 03:53:28,420
[SPEAKER_14]: If you walk in, it's a $3 charge.

3218
03:53:28,480 --> 03:53:30,562
[SPEAKER_14]: If you go online and people need to know that.

3219
03:53:30,782 --> 03:53:31,602
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that in there?

3220
03:53:31,662 --> 03:53:32,383
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not in there.

3221
03:53:32,423 --> 03:53:33,064
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not in here.

3222
03:53:33,864 --> 03:53:34,845
[SPEAKER_14]: They need to change these.

3223
03:53:35,515 --> 03:53:36,936
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if this is going to be accurate.

3224
03:53:37,036 --> 03:53:38,638
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe the mailings already went out.

3225
03:53:38,658 --> 03:53:39,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know something?

3226
03:53:39,478 --> 03:53:40,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's a shame.

3227
03:53:42,181 --> 03:53:44,743
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just monetary extortion by them.

3228
03:53:44,763 --> 03:53:47,225
[SPEAKER_14]: $3 to go online to get a permit.

3229
03:53:47,905 --> 03:53:48,386
[SPEAKER_24]: Come on.

3230
03:53:48,446 --> 03:53:53,670
[SPEAKER_24]: Counselor Knight, your records from the 16th.

3231
03:53:54,311 --> 03:53:56,853
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, I ask that the records remain tabled as I'm reviewing the tape.

3232
03:53:57,607 --> 03:53:59,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3233
03:53:59,548 --> 03:54:02,831
[SPEAKER_24]: On motion that they, Councilor Knight, that they remain tabled.

3236
03:54:10,457 --> 03:54:10,977
[SPEAKER_24]: She's gone.

3237
03:54:11,577 --> 03:54:11,978
[SPEAKER_24]: Table them.

3238
03:54:12,578 --> 03:54:15,921

03:54:17,842 --> 03:54:21,605
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso, that this meeting be adjourned.
