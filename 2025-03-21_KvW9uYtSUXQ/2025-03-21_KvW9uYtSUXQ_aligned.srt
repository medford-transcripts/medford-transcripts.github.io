00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:47,692
Thank you.

183
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:10,002
So we're going to go into a brief recess right here with the agreement of the members to take a photograph with the girls team and then we'll move on to the volleyball.

184
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:54,398
call the meeting back to order.

185
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:59,841
We have a similar presentation for the girls volleyball team, who is also the GBL champions.

186
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:12,027
In my hand here I have a citation that reads, the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to Tyler Dyer, head coach of the Medford High School girls varsity volleyball team.

187
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:21,946
in recognition of winning the Greater Boston League title with a regular season record of 10-8 and a playoff berth in the MIAA State Division I North Girls Tournament for the Fall 2014 season.

188
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:50,390

189
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,139

Jocelyn McCarthy.

195
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,090
Katrina Rasche.

196
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:35,399
Victoria Rasche.

197
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,880

And lastly, Abby McCarthy.

203
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:51,790
Congratulations to the 2014 Medford High School Girls Volleyball Champions.

204
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,684
I'd just like to thank City Council for having us here today.

205
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:07,487
This is the first time in Medford history that the girls volleyball team has won the GBL.

206
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:15,573
So I'm so proud of you girls.

207
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:20,496
You work so hard all season and I'm just so impressed with you and I can't wait to get you all back next year.

208
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:21,757
Thank you.

209
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,622
I'm going to take a brief recess to take a photograph with the team.

210
00:20:56,283 --> 00:21:00,544
Item number 15003 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

211
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:12,667
Be it resolved that the standing committee rules be adopted as the standing rules of the City Council insofar as they are applicable on the motion of approval by Councilor Caraviello.

212
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:13,627
All those in favor?

213
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,007
Aye.

214
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:15,327
All those opposed?

215
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:19,608
Motion is so ordered.

216
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:21,309
15004 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

217
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:25,830
Be it resolved that the City Council transfers all papers and committees

218
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:31,218
or on the table from the 2014 council to the 2015 council.

219
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:39,144
On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, all in favor?

220
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:39,964
Aye.

221
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:41,585
All those opposed?

222
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,187
The motion carries.

223
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:47,270
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

224
00:21:48,696 --> 00:21:49,196
Item number 15005.

225
00:21:52,137 --> 00:22:01,680
Petition by Mary Kay Benoit of 8 9th Street, Medford to address the council on the Medford Scene Center.

226
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:04,401
Is the petitioner present?

227
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:15,265
On the motion of Vice President Longo-Curran to table.

228
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:16,923
All those in favor?

229
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:17,584
Aye.

230
00:22:17,624 --> 00:22:18,404
All those opposed?

231
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:19,905
Motion's tabled.

232
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:38,235
On motion number, item number 15-006, petition by Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, to address the council on non-profits use of Medford's name.

233
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:40,917
Is the petitioner present?

234
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,786
I think the petitioner is entering the chambers as we speak.

235
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:53,353
Mr. Viglione, your item is up for presentation.

236
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:55,756
We'll give you a moment to compose yourself.

237
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:17,853
Good evening.

238
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:21,716
Please state your name and address for the record, please.

239
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:22,697
Good evening.

240
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:25,959
My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

241
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:27,920
Wow, you went through that pretty quick.

242
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:29,561
Happy New Year, City Council.

243
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,142
Congratulations, Council President.

244
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:33,584
I'm sure you're going to be a fine Council President.

245
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,066
Congratulations, Ms.

246
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:36,606
Lungelkern.

247
00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:40,629
And I wanted to talk about nonprofits.

248
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:46,213
There are approximately 22,000 nonprofits in Massachusetts.

249
00:23:47,922 --> 00:23:49,403
over a million nationwide.

250
00:23:51,824 --> 00:24:02,189
And in Medford, we have had problems with sports and other entities not being properly monitored.

251
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:17,477
The core issue here is that the nonprofits in question, three of them, had people in power for 30 years, 25 years, and I think it's incumbent upon elected officials

252
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,198
to monitor these non-profits.

253
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,060
Because someone has to.

254
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,281
Where do you go to monitor a non-profit?

255
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:32,825
You can go to the Attorney General's office, you can go to the District Attorney, you can go to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, but what gets done?

256
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:43,812
So now we have a new TV station up at the high school, but we have questions about where all this money went from the previous one.

257
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,514
West Medford Hillside Little League was able to

258
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:53,735
through an insurance policy, recoup some of the funds, some of the funds, not all of them.

259
00:24:55,955 --> 00:25:14,741
I want to know what the elected officials in Medford, the school committee, the mayor, the city solicitor, the city council can do about looking closely at these entities, because if you look at Martha Coakley's site, I know she left office, but the site is still up today, it says that

260
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:19,575
These nonprofits, these public charities, are supposed to help the public, Council President.

261
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:23,458
And in Medford, are they?

262
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:25,299
Where is our community?

263
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,781
We have an issue with pay to park.

264
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:44,253
This is something that the nonprofits could work together to say, hey, when we're having an event at the Chevalier Theater, maybe it should be free parking on that evening without a solid government

265
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:51,394
look at these nonprofits and how they operate, we're going to have the same old, same old problem.

266
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:56,416
Now, City Solicitor Rumley did a great job in 2008 with something we call the Rumley Report.

267
00:25:56,856 --> 00:26:06,200
It was written February 14, 2008, readily available on the web, but it was like going to a dead end.

268
00:26:07,663 --> 00:26:14,807
Our city solicitor worked very hard to find all this information, and the mayor met with that nonprofit at two pizza parlors.

269
00:26:15,468 --> 00:26:16,949
I don't understand, Council President.

270
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:22,692
So in 2015, I want to know how we can govern these nonprofits better.

271
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:23,993
They're independent.

272
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:25,714
They have a board of directors.

273
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:26,774
They have a president.

274
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:29,396
But they just do things that are

275
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:40,455
To the benefit of the board members, even if they're being honest with the money, they still make it a closed club, some of these entities.

276
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:46,679
I want to know what this council can do because we pay a lot of money to each councilor, a lot of money.

277
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:54,583
And I know you all work hard and you go through the year looking at doing the best job you can.

278
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:59,026
But with the kind of government we have, with this mayor having all the power,

279
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:05,082
I think the city council needs to look at the money they're getting paid and say, hey, how can we control this a little bit better?

280
00:27:05,502 --> 00:27:05,842
Thank you.

281
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:08,525
Motion to receive and place on file.

282
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:12,268
On the motion of Councilor Camuso to receive and place in file.

283
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:13,048
All those in favor.

284
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:14,249
Councilor Penta.

285
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,071
On that motion.

286
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:20,795
On that subject matter, I believe it's incumbent upon somebody in the city.

287
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:25,819
And it's obvious that the administration maybe doesn't want to handle it.

288
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,740
It doesn't want to talk about it.

289
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,561
But the fact of the matter is,

290
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:30,753
We have two particular cases that I wrote standing.

291
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:34,075
One is the West Method Little League Hillside, and the other one is Channel 3.

292
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:45,642
And Channel 3 has a large duty of obligation to the rate payers who have Comcast television, and now for those folks that have Verizon television.

293
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:53,027
Because on a monthly basis, a fee has been taken out of your Comcast and Verizon bills for the purposes of giving you public access TV.

294
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:57,810
Why the mayor decided to choose to put it up at the high school, a place that's not convenient,

295
00:27:58,482 --> 00:28:06,984
and centrally located as was suggested by the that the mayor commissioned back in January, which submitted their report this past March.

296
00:28:07,044 --> 00:28:08,024
I mean, April, excuse me.

297
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:11,125
Um, I don't know why, but the fact of the matter is it's going up there.

298
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,665
But during that period of time, there's a lot of new folks that are here.

299
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:21,687
So you might as well hear it for the first time during that period of time, since December of 2000, um, 2013 till now, uh, the city of Medford has amassed over 356 million, $356,000 of your rate payers money.

300
00:28:27,864 --> 00:28:30,585
And we haven't had public access TV during that period of time.

301
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:47,234
Now, there's an approximate cost of, I believe, in the booklet that we received two weeks ago, of a cost of approximately $300,000, I think, and $26,000 to refurbish a particular part of the vocational school to have public access be up there and running.

302
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:49,675
I may be off by a few dollars, but I think that's the dollar amount.

303
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:52,819
With that being said, you know, it's a step.

304
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:54,060
Is it a step in the right direction?

305
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,701
Hopefully it is.

306
00:28:55,262 --> 00:29:00,770
But the fact of the matter is that the old board of directors and the members of Channel 3 have been unaccounting

307
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:12,009
are unaccountable for all the monies that they had not only in their inventory of assets, but also in their inventory of cash and deposits minutes to the meeting.

308
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:22,033
And as Mr. Viglione indicated, um, our city solicitor has made numerous requests of those folks to submit the returns, um, to give our cash balances.

309
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:23,393
What's the name of the bank accounts?

310
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,853
And we have yet to receive that.

311
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:38,456
I know that they filed a petition of dissolution back, I believe, in October of 2014, in 2013, excuse me.

312
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:41,276
And to this day, we still have nothing.

313
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:43,837
What it's going to take, I don't know.

314
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:50,918
I would hope that the mayor would have been more aggressive in going after your money, because it is your money, as a rate payer.

315
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:55,865
to a cable TV subscriber, Comcast, and now Verizon, that's an awful lot of money.

316
00:29:56,225 --> 00:29:57,506
But we haven't had it for a while.

317
00:29:57,906 --> 00:30:04,550
So, I think if I understood the gentleman at the podium correctly, these are things that are part of our municipal government.

318
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:16,136
And when you attach the name of Medfit on anything that a governmental entity or a non-governmental entity might do, but to take advantage of the city's name of Medfit, I think there is a sense of responsibility that we do have.

319
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:19,018
And I would hope, Mr. President, under your leadership,

320
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:40,602
there would be some sense of a committee meeting that would direct ourselves by way of maybe either policy or directing of the mayor to report back as it relates to these entities that use the name of Medfit to their advantage, but to the disadvantage of the people who are using, are playing, or a cable subscriber that unfortunately has the name of Medfit attached to it.

321
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:46,687
So I think before you receive it and place it on file, there is a common understanding I think that needs to be made

322
00:30:47,259 --> 00:31:07,811
to cable TV subscribers, because I think if they knew each and every month, Mr. President, that money was coming out of their cable bill since December of 2013 until now, and if they realize that the city is sitting on $356,000 of their money, and there was no public access station for all that period of time, I don't think that they would appreciate it, and I don't think a lot of people understand it, because it's just

323
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:14,270
That's a small little notation on your cable bill, but it's there each and every month, whether it's 97 cents or a dollar something, whatever it might be.

324
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,031
But I just wanted to say that.

325
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:29,016
If I can comment, I'm under the impression that that amount that's been sitting dormant from all of our bills is actually a bit more, but I don't have an accurate rendering on that.

326
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:34,798
And for all the money we pay in cable and there's nothing ever on TV, Mr. Councilor.

327
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,039
Thank you.

328
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:37,259
Thank you.

329
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:38,026
Thank you.

330
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:39,908
It's on motion of Councillor Camuso.

331
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:43,270
Councillor?

332
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,213
I agree with Councillor Penter to the point.

333
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:53,999
If people are going to use the name Medford, the city seal or anything of that nature, then the city should be a watchdog.

334
00:31:54,019 --> 00:32:02,826
I think this has to be with websites that are out there, domain names and things of that nature too, because people do maliciously name Medford.

335
00:32:03,986 --> 00:32:06,507
for different entities, including the gentleman that just spoke.

336
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:12,449
So maybe if we want to look at this, we'll look at anything that contains the name Medford and get ahold of it.

337
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:15,730
And I look forward to doing that under Councilor Pinter's recommendation at the subcommittee.

338
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:23,953
So if we can send that to the appropriate subcommittee, once the subcommittees have been reorganized, we'll certainly bring that up.

339
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:25,873
Gentleman is at the podium.

340
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:27,494
Thank you very much, Council President.

341
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:28,234
Let me clarify.

342
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:46,114
My petitions about non-profits that use the name Medford, anyone in this community who is a taxpayer and who is a resident can use the name Medford any way they want, as long as they're not wanting to overthrow the government or, you know, things of that nature.

343
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:50,315
But come on, non-profits using the name Medford are what I spoke about.

344
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:56,469
And there's a certain individual on this council that likes to engage in subterfuge, and it is wrong.

345
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:03,173
Non-profits using the land, using ballparks, have to be held accountable.

346
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:09,537
And that individual that spoke up should have been the first person looking at the books, not enjoying benefiting from TV3.

347
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:12,419
in violation of the Internal Revenue Code.

348
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:17,581
So he ought to shut his mouth and let us do the city business that he doesn't want to do for that money.

349
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:21,623
And I would appreciate him not speaking because for obvious reasons.

350
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:30,846
Well, with all due respect, as long as as long as I'm sitting here, this individual I do not want in my life.

351
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,207
I'll get a restraining order on him.

352
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:33,107
Joe, good luck to you.

353
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,888
I think there's a lot of people out here that want him on you.

354
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:38,630
So good luck to you in your future endeavors, Mr. Viglione.

355
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:43,873
With all due respect, I'm just referring to what my council colleague said.

356
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:54,319
Nothing to do with the gentleman at the podium stated, but my council colleague actually said it eloquently, Councilor Penta, in any and all institutions and our endeavors that use the word Medford.

357
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:59,582
And I think it's something that's wise, and I want to applaud Councilor Penta for expanding on the gentleman's views.

358
00:33:59,682 --> 00:34:01,683
So thank you very much, Councilor.

359
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:02,950
Duly noted.

360
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:07,412
Mr. Sir, state your name and address for the record, please.

361
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:08,652
Thank you, Mr. President.

362
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:11,373
I'm Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

363
00:34:11,873 --> 00:34:13,774
Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

364
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:31,840
I fully agree through the chair with Councillor Camuso that if this gentleman wants to look at things with the name Medford attached to it, even though he's not a nonprofit organization, he uses Medford Information Central.

365
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:42,484
to go after people vehemently, and this reflects badly on the city of Medford when he uses the name Medford on it.

366
00:34:42,604 --> 00:34:44,405
It is a disrespect to the city.

367
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:45,867
It should be looked into.

368
00:34:46,227 --> 00:34:51,271
For a quick example, he referred to City School Committee member Aaron DiBenedetto.

369
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,829
And I won't repeat the name, in a derogatory name.

370
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:59,653
If he's going to use Medford, he needs to represent Medford as a respectable city that it is.

371
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:02,295
I want to thank Councillor Camuso for bringing that up.

372
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:03,055
Thank you.

373
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:03,756
Thank you, sir.

374
00:35:03,856 --> 00:35:06,418
And will Councillor Carafiello.

375
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:07,879
Thank you, Mr. President.

376
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,061
I'll yield to Mr. Viglione.

377
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,002
inside Medford, Medford Transcript, the media, whether you like it or not, there's no free speech in this city.

378
00:35:18,462 --> 00:35:21,783
No one can say ee, ooh, or boo about anything in this city.

379
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:27,645
If you make a comment about money being stolen at West Medford Hillside Little League, oh my God.

380
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,191
You know, if you make a comment about Erin DiBenedetto, which is, she's a lovely person.

381
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:34,331
School committee people are great.

382
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:39,752
But if I disagree with her politics, we need an ombudsman for this city.

383
00:35:40,113 --> 00:35:43,453
Mr. Cappucci doesn't like it because I explained his platform.

384
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:44,614
It was very narrow.

385
00:35:44,754 --> 00:35:45,254
God bless him.

386
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:46,214
I think he's a great guy.

387
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,695
But he wasn't ready for prime time to go after Senator Jalen.

388
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,255
A very respected person.

389
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:52,955
She got my vote.

390
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:57,777
I voted Republican across the board this time, but Pat Jalen got my vote.

391
00:35:57,977 --> 00:35:58,677
She's a good woman.

392
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:05,458
Medford, if you want to have a magazine, and if Mr. Cappucci doesn't like it, he can create his own magazine.

393
00:36:05,738 --> 00:36:07,819
But the nonprofits is what I wrote about.

394
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,879
It is in the agenda.

395
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,681
non-profits using the name Medford.

396
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:17,762
Let's get it straight.

397
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:25,446
And I'm glad that we had 250,000 hits tonight, a quarter of a million on medfordinformationcentral.blogspot.com.

398
00:36:25,486 --> 00:36:26,527
I'm glad people are reading it.

399
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:30,549
A quarter million hits, I must be doing something right, because no one's reading those other rags.

400
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:32,470
Quick question for the gentleman at the podium.

401
00:36:33,784 --> 00:36:36,006
Well, I'd just like to know, do you have press credentials?

402
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:41,510
Because when other reporters come to this meeting, I notice they actually have credentials issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

403
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,873
If we could address all of our remarks to the chair.

404
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:45,513
I apologize.

405
00:36:45,854 --> 00:36:47,155
I'm published in eight books, sir.

406
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:48,256
I just finished another book.

407
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:50,397
Do you have press credentials from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?

408
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:50,798
Yes or no?

409
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:51,358
It's very easy.

410
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,560
I have my own press credentials, sir.

411
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,861
From the Commonwealth?

412
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,863
I don't want to talk to you, Paul Calusa, because you are a reprobate.

413
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:58,804
I'll do my own research.

414
00:36:59,304 --> 00:36:59,565
Thank you.

415
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:00,505
I'll do my own research.

416
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:06,765
Councilor Caraviello, and then Councilor Knight.

417
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:08,245
Thank you, Mr. President.

418
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:12,067
Mr. President, I've been involved in many nonprofits in the city for a long time.

419
00:37:12,808 --> 00:37:16,209
I know some of my other colleagues on the council have been, and most of them are good.

420
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:25,493
I mean, there's been a few bad apples over the years, but I think you're seeing now people are being more responsible and where the money's being spent over the years.

421
00:37:25,573 --> 00:37:28,895
And part of it comes from the same board being on there too long.

422
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:35,610
And I say, I think now, a new day and age, people are asking questions where they never asked before.

423
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:41,555
So don't condemn all the good organizations for those couple of bad ones.

424
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:42,176
Thank you.

425
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:53,105
And as we all know, the Office of the Attorney General scrutinizes all the books of nonprofits, as well as all their filings and tax filings.

426
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:54,266
Counselor Knight.

427
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:58,648
I'll yield my time to the gentleman at the podium, Mr. President.

428
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:00,149
Thank you, Counselor.

429
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:04,612
Mr. President, through the chair, thank you, Counselor Knight.

430
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:09,855
Really briefly, on the issue of free speech, I'm not out to deny anybody's free speech.

431
00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:15,179
We have certain inalienable rights, but with these rights comes responsibility.

432
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:22,203
I have the freedom of speech right now to scream fire and scare everybody to run out, and that's a matter of free speech.

433
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:25,505
But it would be highly irresponsible of me to do so.

434
00:38:26,063 --> 00:38:30,165
And this is the point I'm trying to make with Medford Information Central.

435
00:38:31,506 --> 00:38:35,128
The gentleman comes up, and he says, I have great respect for Aaron DiBenedetto.

436
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:41,652
But then he calls her Aaron DiBenderover on his website.

437
00:38:42,672 --> 00:38:45,033
And Mr. President, I agree with you.

438
00:38:45,354 --> 00:38:46,594
I don't tolerate it either.

439
00:38:46,854 --> 00:38:51,237
With freedom of speech comes responsibility into being adult.

440
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:55,128
and represent our city in a respectable way.

441
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:56,369
That's all I'm asking for.

442
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:56,989
Thank you, Mr. President.

443
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:57,369
Thank you.

444
00:38:57,389 --> 00:38:58,130
Councilor Knight.

445
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:04,014
Mr. President, I think that it's about time we move on the question.

446
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:09,818
On the motion of Councilor Camuso, as amended to receive and place on file.

447
00:39:09,998 --> 00:39:14,682
I withdraw to receive and place on file.

448
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:20,523
as amended to be sent to the appropriate committee.

449
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:29,785
Once those committees have been that, um, Mr. President, may I be so bold to suggest that business and economic development be the appropriate committee that that'd be central.

450
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:35,026
We're on the motion of council night that the paper would be sent to the business and economic development committee.

451
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:38,887
There may be a new committee you may want to find.

452
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,727
You may want to eliminate some committees.

453
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:44,128
Mr. President, at the present time, we adopted the standing rules of the committee.

454
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,448
So those committees are presently,

455
00:39:45,952 --> 00:39:48,155
enacted until we make a change to the rules of the standing rules.

456
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:50,938
Your point of order is so noted and regarded.

457
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,143
And so to that committee as indicated by Councilor Knight.

458
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:56,004
All those in favor?

459
00:39:56,845 --> 00:39:57,666
All those opposed?

460
00:39:58,747 --> 00:39:59,568
So moved.

461
00:40:02,912 --> 00:40:06,516
Folks, I know there's a number of you that want to speak here on a particular matter.

462
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:12,323
We're just gonna tidy up one more piece of business and then we're gonna do that.

463
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:20,585
So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello for suspension of the rules to take a paper out of order.

464
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:21,925
All those in favor?

465
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:22,665
Aye.

466
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:23,626
All those opposed?

467
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:30,907
Number 15-007, request for expenditure from law department claims over $1,000.

468
00:40:30,947 --> 00:40:31,367
Account number 10.

469
00:40:35,192 --> 00:40:37,473
1-5-1-5-7-6-2.

470
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:40,355
Date, December 23rd, 2014.

471
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:45,577
To the President and members of the Honorable Medford City Council, from Mayor Michael J. McGlynn.

472
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:49,639
Claimant name, Dorothy Dixon v. City of Medford.

473
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,840

474
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,041
Date of settlement, December 23rd, 2014.

475
00:40:58,738 --> 00:41:00,699
Date of trial reside, non-applicable.

476
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,240
Amount of request, $5,000.

477
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,361
Claimant's attorney, Jeffrey C. Levy, Esquire.

478
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:07,782
Description of alleged claim.

479
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:14,145
The claimant, Dorothy Dixon of 4 Kilby Street in Woburn, seeks compensation for personal injuries.

480
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,627
On the motion of Counselor Marks,

481
00:41:22,454 --> 00:41:28,680
woman had a collision with a city vehicle with a child in the car.

482
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:40,971
Driver had some injuries regarding some $4,392 worth of medical bills and a total settlement, which will exceed that eventually.

483
00:41:41,592 --> 00:41:44,134
And the total settlement is for $5,000.

484
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:48,318
We have the representative of the office of the city solicitor here.

485
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,008
If you could just state your name and address for the record.

486
00:41:52,228 --> 00:41:52,489
Real quickly.

487
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:53,849
Thank you, Mr. President, Councilors.

488
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:58,412
Kimberly Scanlon, 75 Ashcroft Road, Assistant City Solicitor for the City of Medford.

489
00:41:58,732 --> 00:41:59,473
Thank you very much.

490
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:03,975
On the motion of approval for Councilor Camuso, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

491
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:09,238
Any item over $500 of expenditure must be approved by roll call vote.

492
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:10,999
Councilor Camuso?

493
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:11,740
Yes.

494
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,241
Councilor Caviello?

495
00:42:13,441 --> 00:42:13,581
Yes.

496
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:14,602
Councilor Knight?

497
00:42:14,722 --> 00:42:14,862
Yes.

498
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:16,815
Vice President Lugo-Curran.

499
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:17,035
Yes.

500
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:18,055
Council March.

501
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:18,476
Yes.

502
00:42:18,756 --> 00:42:19,456
Council Penta.

503
00:42:19,516 --> 00:42:19,696
Yes.

504
00:42:20,176 --> 00:42:21,156
President DelaRusso.

505
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:21,696
Yes.

506
00:42:23,697 --> 00:42:25,757
Vote of seven affirmative, non-negative.

507
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:26,597
The motion passes.

508
00:42:27,197 --> 00:42:27,557
Thank you.

509
00:42:27,757 --> 00:42:28,618
Thank you, Mr. President.

510
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:37,799
Do I have a paper on that?

511
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,961
Where is it?

512
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:50,702
Is she here?

513
00:42:51,183 --> 00:42:51,863
She was tabled.

514
00:42:54,965 --> 00:42:55,305
Is Ms.

515
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:56,706
Benoit here?

516
00:43:00,268 --> 00:43:02,969
On the motion of Councilor Camuso to hear concerned citizens.

517
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:09,953
To hear from the Chief of Police as well as concerned citizens.

518
00:43:10,974 --> 00:43:12,735
On the motion of Councilor Camuso.

519
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:13,596
All those in favor?

520
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:13,816
Aye.

521
00:43:14,236 --> 00:43:14,936
All those opposed?

522
00:43:15,277 --> 00:43:15,877
Motion passes.

523
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:16,992
Mr. Chief.

524
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:22,014
Mr. President, uh, Leo Sacco, police chief in the city of Medford.

525
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:24,075
I live at two 27 Elm street in Medford.

526
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:30,578
Uh, I think it's appropriate at this time that, uh, members of the public present their concerns.

527
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:34,159
I'm here to answer questions that may develop as a result of their concerns.

528
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:38,401
And with me tonight, I have, uh, two representatives from Republic parking.

529
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:41,642
I have Jack Skelton, who is one of the principals of the firm.

530
00:43:42,082 --> 00:43:44,523
And I also have Dan Nash, who's a regional manager.

531
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:47,488
who's overseeing the operation here in Medford at this point.

532
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:50,750
So I yield to the, uh, to the public.

533
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:51,551
Thank you, chief.

534
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:53,792
And folks, just a kind word to you all.

535
00:43:53,892 --> 00:44:00,135
I know this is a, uh, subject of great concern, uh, to so many of you here tonight.

536
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:08,560
Um, just, uh, we like everything to be done in an orderly way as hopefully had been evidenced earlier.

537
00:44:09,132 --> 00:44:13,374
and we allow you to come up and speak for no more than 10 minutes.

538
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:28,099
And I think if my council colleagues will perhaps agree and bear with me, we'll allow the citizens to speak, and then the councilors will have their opportunity to interchange with the people and the officials present.

539
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:31,200
Yes, Councilor Marks.

540
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,542
Just before we get started, Mr. President, it would have been, in my opinion, helpful to have a public hearing

541
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:48,142
prior to any negotiations, prior to any contact with the potential outside firm that's taking over parking management.

542
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:55,866
It would have been helpful to have businesses, residents at the table before change could happen.

543
00:44:57,207 --> 00:45:03,971
And now we're at a point where the program's starting and we want to hear from residents and we want to hear from business owners.

544
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:06,352
And I just think this process has been

545
00:45:07,023 --> 00:45:09,538
backwards, to be quite honest with you, Mr. President.

546
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:23,826
And I'm hoping that Chief Sackler's here tonight, and there's two gentlemen from Republic.

547
00:45:23,866 --> 00:45:30,509
But I'm hoping some of what takes place tonight, the comments that we hear, doesn't fall on deaf ears.

548
00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:41,934
Because as we've seen just over the last couple of weeks, that the administration has made several major changes to his pay for parking proposal.

549
00:45:42,498 --> 00:45:46,199
based on input, which should have been had months and months ago.

550
00:45:46,779 --> 00:46:04,162
So, you know, I, it's great that residents are coming up, but I hope that whatever stated that the mayor really takes into consideration and, uh, uh, if need be sit back down with Republican, the chief, uh, and I and out some of these major concerns we still exist was the president.

551
00:46:04,382 --> 00:46:06,062
And I thank you for giving me that opportunity.

552
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:06,562
Thank you.

553
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,382
Counselor Marks.

554
00:46:07,482 --> 00:46:10,763
And also if I could, um, uh, just point out that, uh,

555
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:24,189
Just before the meeting, a Park Medford parking information pamphlet was just published and distributed within the past day or so.

556
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,653
And hopefully this will be distributed to the citizens of Medford.

557
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:30,934
Councilor Penter, did you want to speak briefly?

558
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:35,157
Yeah, one quick point before the citizens speak, and I think it has to be made clear.

559
00:46:35,738 --> 00:46:40,101
The Medford City Council did not vote for this paid park program.

560
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:53,772
The council agenda of 14472 on May 20th of 2014 read as follows for the purposes of supporting the mayor to entertain or to engage in a 10-year contract and then report back.

561
00:46:54,253 --> 00:46:57,795
But that resolution was amended.

562
00:46:58,175 --> 00:46:59,456
And this is the exact words.

563
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:03,478
And if anybody doubts what I'm saying, you can get a copy of the tape and watch it.

564
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:05,599
The exact words are as follows.

565
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,181
And it's not the exact words that are in the minutes of the meeting.

566
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:10,162
It says the following, to amend the motion

567
00:47:10,424 --> 00:47:14,807
that the council meet before the signing so that we have a complete understanding.

568
00:47:15,228 --> 00:47:38,306
And at that point, I was interrupted by city solicitor Rumbley, who then indicated by saying that he thought it would be a good idea to have the company and also show the council certain things about the machine and of end of quote, then I continued on to say, so as amended that having the major, the mayor, whoever the vendor might be to present themselves before the council before the finalization of the contract.

569
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:39,307
Now,

570
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:45,057
That is officially on our records of our meeting.

571
00:47:46,138 --> 00:47:52,145
September 10th of this past year, the Memphis City Council met for the purposes of looking at a contract.

572
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:55,808
right here, we've got two of them.

573
00:47:56,528 --> 00:47:59,029
One we got in September and another one in October.

574
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,052
The exact same contract a month apart with just one difference.

575
00:48:03,732 --> 00:48:13,897
The Medford City Council at that meeting on September 10th was met at that room by Medford citizens, certain members of the council, and questions as it relates to the contract that was being presented.

576
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:22,302
The Medford City Council never ever took a vote to finalize or giving the mayor the final authority for the purposes of engaging

577
00:48:22,622 --> 00:48:24,042
in this pay-to-park program.

578
00:48:24,442 --> 00:48:35,225
So what you have here right now and what you talk about right now is completely the Mayor McGlynn's pay-to-park program with no endorsement from the City of Medford's Council or any other elected official.

579
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:43,067
It's his program and he owns it and unfortunately you're here tonight but whatever we can do to resolve it, this is the intent of the City Council.

580
00:48:43,307 --> 00:48:45,608
Unfortunately I wish the Mayor was here to listen to you

581
00:48:45,948 --> 00:48:49,011
Like Councilman Mark said, it should have gone around to the entire community.

582
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:52,033
There's a whole bunch of issues, and pitches don't lie.

583
00:48:52,093 --> 00:48:53,875
I've got a whole bunch of pitches, and I have comments.

584
00:48:53,915 --> 00:49:01,060
I've received 106 emails from business people throughout this community in the last two days, because they're starting to find out about it.

585
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:14,031
But I'm willing to stay here all night, listen to whatever your comments are, and Chief, with all due respect, I think this is a bogus plan implemented upon the citizens, the business community, and the taxpayers of the city of Memphis.

586
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:23,470
Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

587
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:28,172
We'll now open up the podium to the citizens who wish to speak.

588
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:30,032
Please approach the podium.

589
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:32,073
You can line up if you'd like.

590
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:39,315
And as you approach, if you could state your name and address clearly so that the clerk may make that part of the public record.

591
00:49:40,555 --> 00:49:42,455
My name is Gwendolyn Blackburn.

592
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:46,497
I live at 233 Arlington Street in West Medford.

593
00:49:48,877 --> 00:49:51,738
Congratulations on becoming the president.

594
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:56,797
and congratulations for being the vice president.

595
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:10,214
I was coming before anybody was coming up here because I served on the committee with Councilor Marks.

596
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:12,032
I was very happy.

597
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,435
I've lived in Medford for 51 years.

598
00:50:15,317 --> 00:50:25,410
And whenever that there is something that I can do to help the city, I have been willing to serve and to help in any way possible.

599
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,842
I served as an administrator in the Meffitt Public Schools for 32 years.

600
00:50:32,522 --> 00:50:34,903
I know a lot of people, know a lot of kids.

601
00:50:36,304 --> 00:50:38,525
And we always tried to do things the right way.

602
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:52,570
When I was asked by the mayor to serve on a parking enforcement committee back in 2009, Councilor Marks, you have to help me, I'm getting old.

603
00:50:54,575 --> 00:51:05,922
It seemed to me like something I really would like to see happen because I felt that there were places certainly in the city where we needed to have enforcement, some enforcement.

604
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,805
We went around to a lot of different places.

605
00:51:09,885 --> 00:51:16,128
I haven't been down here before because Councilor Marks has been talking about what we did.

606
00:51:17,689 --> 00:51:23,513
And then the nights that I thought it would come, it was either pouring rain, it was very cold or something.

607
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:45,218
But at this point in time, with what is going on and what has happened, without any knowledge of the citizens, unless some of you got the knowledge that they were going to be putting these stanchions or whatever they are in the street, I thought it was important.

608
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,003
The businesses are going to be suffering.

609
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,793
There's a house on High Street, number 418.

610
00:51:54,973 --> 00:52:04,360
And if it was my house, I would take a sledgehammer, and it would be on the ground by now, because it would be in front of that house.

611
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:08,883
I don't know who went with these people, whoever they are.

612
00:52:09,784 --> 00:52:22,836
and showed them places that these so-called kiosks, or whatever they are, who showed them where they should be, because they are in many inappropriate places.

613
00:52:23,636 --> 00:52:29,642
The other part that happened, when we had our committee, we worked with the businesses.

614
00:52:30,142 --> 00:52:36,087
We had a public meeting, and there was standing room right here in this council chamber.

615
00:52:36,788 --> 00:52:41,454
The business people had an opportunity to tell us what they would like to see.

616
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:44,278
And we made that report.

617
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:47,783
And I love the chief.

618
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:50,326
I'm not going to pick on you.

619
00:52:51,928 --> 00:53:00,551
He was our chair, and he went with us to every city and town that we went to to see what their program was like.

620
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:03,352
We got a lot of good information.

621
00:53:03,912 --> 00:53:14,456
We thought that it would be good to have some of the senior citizens, such as they have in Malden, to go around and do the parking enforcement.

622
00:53:15,616 --> 00:53:23,661
At one point, when we did have an opportunity to have a conversation with the mayor, he spoke about a kiosk at that time.

623
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:32,106
We said, no, we don't want kiosks unless, like Arlington, they're in parking lots.

624
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,721
That is not what has happened.

625
00:53:35,021 --> 00:53:45,849
He thought, on the street, we were opposed, and maybe not all of us, most of us on the committee, we were opposed to having kiosks on the street.

626
00:53:46,229 --> 00:53:56,776
Have people come put money here or there or wherever, and then walk eight spots down the street so that you can go to, maybe you're going to, as he said,

627
00:53:57,997 --> 00:54:00,598
Medford Pastry, but it could be on the corner.

628
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:03,600
We were opposed to all that.

629
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:13,504
We wanted to have, and the businesses wanted to have some meters, and we agreed to talk about having meters on the street.

630
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:18,447
The police officers, who have a lot of things to do,

631
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:29,674
They wanted to do the enforcement, and that was fine, but we also felt that some of our senior citizens could do that as well.

632
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:34,718
We're in a situation now that I, from what I'm told,

633
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:39,000
that we're stuck for 10 years with these things.

634
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,141
We don't even know anything about them.

635
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,782
No one has contacted us.

636
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:54,207
And whatever you have that's going to be mailed to us, people are being stopped on the street, and they're being told, you have to put money in these things.

637
00:54:54,947 --> 00:54:57,969
Well, I know they're called kiosks, but I could call them something else.

638
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:10,301
I think that we have been really dealt a really bad hand at this point in time.

639
00:55:10,882 --> 00:55:18,169
That we were not given the respect as citizens and taxpayers, and by the way, my tax bill went up again.

640
00:55:27,897 --> 00:55:32,782
But we're not being treated properly in this city.

641
00:55:33,723 --> 00:55:38,387
You want to do something, don't talk to the citizens like our committee did.

642
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:48,817
Our committee had the citizens, the public, come out so that they would have an input in what they wanted to see as parking enforcement in our city.

643
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:50,499
Didn't happen now.

644
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:58,567
Next thing we heard, we had kiosks or next thing I saw these things coming up around different places on the street.

645
00:55:58,907 --> 00:56:03,892
I guess there's one up on the steps of the cemetery or right in front of the steps of the cemetery.

646
00:56:04,633 --> 00:56:07,876
I've gone up and down the street to see where I can find some.

647
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:10,258
I don't understand.

648
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:19,601
I don't understand why people are being stopped now and told that they have to put money in these things when we have not even gotten any mail.

649
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:24,303
And I had heard we were going to get a letter or some direction as to how it works.

650
00:56:25,143 --> 00:56:34,707
I was also told that if you go down and talk to the mayor, if you have a place that you would not like to see it, go talk to the mayor, and the mayor will tell you, go see.

651
00:56:35,107 --> 00:56:36,508
Well, I can't do anything about it.

652
00:56:37,328 --> 00:56:40,990
You need to get in touch with Republic or whoever they are.

653
00:56:41,391 --> 00:56:42,851
What do they know about our city?

654
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:44,452
We had a wonderful city.

655
00:56:44,472 --> 00:56:49,255
There was a man up here last week, I believe, from West Medford who had a lot to say.

656
00:56:49,575 --> 00:56:53,858
And I wish I could have been here with him so I could have applauded what he had to say.

657
00:56:54,338 --> 00:56:59,301
People move to Medford because of the kind of city that we have here.

658
00:56:59,982 --> 00:57:03,364
And people move to West Medford because it's like the village.

659
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:16,847
But I don't know how these businesses are going to stay in business with the way that this thing, of course, we don't really know how it's working because we haven't gotten that kind of information, but I guess it's coming.

660
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:28,531
We have right here, I have brought along with us tonight the owner of one of the sub shops in West Mefford who has

661
00:57:30,536 --> 00:57:36,542
petitions from people who signed in West Medford in his snapshot.

662
00:57:36,722 --> 00:57:39,544
Jimmy, why don't you and your son come up and bring your petitions.

663
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:43,188
You can give them to the city councilors.

664
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:49,998
I'm Jimmy, Jimmy Spirakis.

665
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,702
If you're through Mrs. Blackburn speaking and wish to yield to this gentleman.

666
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:59,045
I'm going to yield to him because he has pages of petitions.

667
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:01,947
Please state your name and address for the record.

668
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:04,029
I'm Jimmy Spirakis.

669
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:07,592
I own the block on High Street 501, 509 and also Jimmy's Pizza.

670
00:58:10,355 --> 00:58:11,255
Thank you very much.

671
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:18,077
And if you have something to be distributed to the council members, you may give it to the messenger of the Medford City Council.

672
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:21,737
And he is the duly appointed person to distribute.

673
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:29,399
Go ahead.

674
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:30,239
I'm the son of Jimmy.

675
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:31,659
Thank you.

676
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:32,499
Welcome.

677
00:58:33,299 --> 00:58:35,000
Do you wish to share anything with the council?

678
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:35,800
Well, uh,

679
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:39,171
Yes, we disagree with this idea.

680
00:58:39,191 --> 00:58:48,233
And every day, we hear customers who say, Jimmy, your business, I'm sorry, they're not going to be the same.

681
00:58:48,513 --> 00:58:55,295
And this is very, you know, very bad decision to do mirrors.

682
00:58:55,315 --> 00:59:04,117
And we come in for 10 minutes to pick up a pizza or something, and we go next door to a tailor just to bring a jacket, something.

683
00:59:04,517 --> 00:59:05,777
You know, it's very bad.

684
00:59:06,662 --> 00:59:10,944
And already today, two customers says, we walk over the place to the road.

685
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:12,485
They walk the road.

686
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:13,586
They don't drive their cars.

687
00:59:14,066 --> 00:59:15,446
They come to pick up a pizza.

688
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:19,308
He says, I'm walk, and I'm going to use my car because I don't want to pay them money.

689
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:27,633
And also, down the street for me, it's another block of businesses.

690
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:29,093
They don't have a mirror over there.

691
00:59:29,854 --> 00:59:36,117
And, of course, businesses, they're going to take from me because they're going to go all the way down because they don't have to pay.

692
00:59:37,753 --> 00:59:39,474
They can buy pizza from other places.

693
00:59:39,835 --> 00:59:41,036
It's no minute on the street.

694
00:59:45,379 --> 00:59:47,021
So I don't think it's a good idea.

695
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,643
And we're going to be, actually, we need help.

696
00:59:50,744 --> 00:59:55,728
The last two or three years, business is about 12% down West Medford.

697
00:59:56,408 --> 01:00:01,332
We need some kind of help to increase the business.

698
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:03,174
Thank you very much.

699
01:00:04,595 --> 01:00:04,895
Thank you.

700
01:00:06,323 --> 01:00:06,843
Thank you.

701
01:00:07,723 --> 01:00:08,683
I guess I'm finished.

702
01:00:09,164 --> 01:00:09,604
Thank you very much.

703
01:00:09,724 --> 01:00:20,366
Well, I'm never finished, but I'll just stop because I think that we're in a bad situation, as far as I can tell, with these kiosks.

704
01:00:21,086 --> 01:00:22,106
That is what they're called?

705
01:00:22,506 --> 01:00:22,766
Yes.

706
01:00:22,826 --> 01:00:23,346
Kiosks.

707
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:23,907
Yeah.

708
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:24,267
Kiosks.

709
01:00:24,407 --> 01:00:30,428
And I think we've really done, or the person who made them possible

710
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:38,470
have put our city in a bad, bad situation and the businesses in a bad, bad situation.

711
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:48,473
And it would have been nice had there been respect given to the citizenry here so that everybody could have had input.

712
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:52,094
And now it sounds like it's too late.

713
01:00:52,594 --> 01:00:53,794
But we're not going to give up.

714
01:00:54,335 --> 01:00:55,595
We'll fight for 10 years.

715
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:05,865
And folks, if you wish to speak, you just stand in the aisle and wait in line.

716
01:01:07,146 --> 01:01:09,668
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

717
01:01:09,688 --> 01:01:12,751
My name is Anthony D'Antonio, Yale Street.

718
01:01:13,391 --> 01:01:14,872
What number, Yale Street, sir?

719
01:01:15,113 --> 01:01:15,333
Number 12.

720
01:01:15,373 --> 01:01:16,274
Number 12, Yale Street.

721
01:01:16,834 --> 01:01:21,778
And congratulations, President De La Russo and Madam Vice President on selection.

722
01:01:21,798 --> 01:01:23,079
Thank you, my neighbor.

723
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:27,689
congratulations on a good year last year from all the council members.

724
01:01:28,029 --> 01:01:35,212
Although I didn't agree with everything you gentlemen and women came up with, but you're doing a great job out there and welcome back to the forefront.

725
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:35,952
Mr. Camuso.

726
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:51,580
I have, uh, I wrote a, uh, a small paper because I wanted to keep on track with what I want to say and some of the issues that have already been brought up, but I need to make,

727
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:58,652
Oh, I need to make some statements.

728
01:01:58,712 --> 01:02:00,072
I want these statements to be heard.

729
01:02:01,353 --> 01:02:23,165
So forgive me if I am redundant and what somebody else has come up and said, but starting off, um, sir, if you could quiet down so that the speaker can be unimpeded, this parking program, as we know, it does not serve the best interests of the citizens.

730
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:35,636
you represent, and in doing so, you've added a financial burden to our residents and our business community, not to mention a physical hardship for the disabled, seniors, and visitors to the city.

731
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:45,502
I will not debate the logistical nightmare in the conception of this program, now known as Park Medford, because many questions still need to be answered.

732
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:53,006
And I am hopeful that this honorable body will answer these questions respectfully, factually, and without prejudice.

733
01:02:54,226 --> 01:02:57,807
Park Medford is not the answer to enforcement in this city.

734
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:02,367
And I'll say it again and again, this is a revenue program.

735
01:03:02,688 --> 01:03:04,388
It is not an enforcement program.

736
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:09,329
I am hopeful, well Park, I'm sorry, I got off the sign there.

737
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:10,469
I got a bigger printing here.

738
01:03:12,929 --> 01:03:14,370
It presents many problems.

739
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:21,571
Among them are inaccuracies, ambiguities, favoritism, short-sightedness, and most glaring,

740
01:03:21,972 --> 01:03:33,799
common sense and respect to our citizens, to the businesses, and to our men and women on the police department, including our traffic supervisors, all of whom are quite capable of doing the job.

741
01:03:34,499 --> 01:03:39,122
Excuses about not being able to add to our public safety budget are just that.

742
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:50,849
It is a sad state of affairs when the hard work, tireless efforts, and recommendations of Mr. Marks and Mrs. Blackburn and other members of the Traffic and Parking Study were totally ignored.

743
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:57,442
due diligence was certainly missing and lacking in this presentation of this parking program.

744
01:03:58,462 --> 01:04:03,164
One cannot orchestrate a tumultuous program such as this in the manner in which it was done.

745
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:09,407
It appears most definitely there has been selective placement of kiosks.

746
01:04:09,987 --> 01:04:12,248
Why no outcry from the Chamber of Commerce?

747
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,669
For what purpose do they exist and for whom do they serve?

748
01:04:16,596 --> 01:04:22,520
They stood by mutely and watched as certain businesses remained free and clear of kiosks, while other businesses did not.

749
01:04:23,981 --> 01:04:28,545
Some politicians lack business experience and business sense, not all but some.

750
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:43,856
But the smart ones, the ones who truly recognize it is their responsibility to work on behalf of the citizenry, will reach out and put the business paradigm on the table in an open forum, not behind closed doors at the expense of the taxpayer.

751
01:04:44,876 --> 01:04:45,757
Why, for instance?

752
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:53,188
And please take note that I am objectively pointing out examples, free of any animosity, and as neutral as I can be.

753
01:04:54,029 --> 01:04:56,090
But I need to make this point by example.

754
01:04:56,771 --> 01:05:02,515
Why do we place kiosks in the center of West Medford Square, but have none as you enter from Arlington?

755
01:05:03,135 --> 01:05:08,359
Examples given, Joe's Peach and Charles Liquors, in the block of stores as you approach Boston Avenue.

756
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:14,283
By the way, I received a text earlier today from Joan Gatto, who is the owner and proprietor of

757
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:16,026
magnificent muffin.

758
01:05:16,366 --> 01:05:25,373
She is out of town and wanted me to express her concern on this particular program, as well as the concern she has for her other business colleagues in the area.

759
01:05:26,474 --> 01:05:43,447
Now to continue, I have to make a statement here and it is with all due respect and it concerns the placement and not placement of kiosks.

760
01:05:43,846 --> 01:05:45,846
and several business establishments in the city.

761
01:05:47,207 --> 01:05:52,948
I have been a long friend to the Dela Russo family in Medford.

762
01:05:54,108 --> 01:05:55,549
I have questions.

763
01:05:56,709 --> 01:05:57,009
Why?

764
01:05:57,029 --> 01:06:01,970
See, when I was growing up, a funeral parlor is solemn to me.

765
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:02,951
It's like a chapel.

766
01:06:03,991 --> 01:06:12,553
Why they would place kiosks in front of certain places like in Sincardi's or Gaffey's,

767
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:18,408
where there are other stores available in the area, and why none at other places?

768
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:20,969
There should be none at all in any of these places.

769
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:23,349
There should be no kiosks in the city of Medford.

770
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:29,491
But the point I want to make is, who came up with this decision to put this here and that there?

771
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:40,553
No kiosks on Main Street all the way from Medford Square to the corner of Wright Avenue and Yale Street, and then stopping at Wareham Street.

772
01:06:41,254 --> 01:06:42,914
I mean, it's a small square.

773
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:47,161
It's, it's, it's vulnerable to going out of business down there.

774
01:06:47,221 --> 01:06:53,442
There's people that are, that are struggling, but yet there's convenience, convenient food markets that have none in front of them.

775
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:59,004
I, I, I find it hard to believe that anybody would put a program together like that.

776
01:06:59,504 --> 01:07:06,186
And I'm sure that the people sitting on the council really didn't have much to do with the placement of the kiosk.

777
01:07:06,206 --> 01:07:06,746
I'm pretty sure.

778
01:07:06,846 --> 01:07:11,487
I know they didn't, but I just don't understand the concept, the idea and how it was put together.

779
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:19,072
I also think it's unconscionable that kiosks are put where people worship, where parents go to pick up their children at the library or at school.

780
01:07:19,632 --> 01:07:28,076
And that two hour and less free parking is available in certain areas and other areas have kiosks and patrons who are required to pay.

781
01:07:29,997 --> 01:07:31,297
No enforcement on Sundays.

782
01:07:31,697 --> 01:07:32,618
That's another question.

783
01:07:33,038 --> 01:07:39,260
Why wouldn't it be prudent to have no enforcement on Saturdays except for permitted streets?

784
01:07:39,561 --> 01:07:40,481
Because on Saturday,

785
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:49,433
Most of the mom and pops, most of the small cash and carries, most of the hair salons, the nail salons, everybody that's in business, that's when they do a brisk business on a Saturday.

786
01:07:49,993 --> 01:07:51,735
Everybody's home for the most part.

787
01:07:52,095 --> 01:07:53,296
Everybody is out shopping.

788
01:07:53,876 --> 01:07:55,637
So why do they need to be punished to pay?

789
01:07:56,658 --> 01:07:59,760
And then on Sunday, there's no enforcement.

790
01:08:01,282 --> 01:08:03,623
And here's a fact for you to digest.

791
01:08:04,244 --> 01:08:10,268
On Sunday spells disaster for our neighborhoods that have permit parking in opposition on the periphery

792
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,039
of the smallest squares.

793
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:14,460
Most businesses are closed.

794
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:23,984
It's a family day, and we will have to put up with noise, more noise, incorrectly parked vehicles, blocked driveways, more garbage thrown on the streets and sidewalks.

795
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,245
Then there's trying to hold spaces for expected company.

796
01:08:28,086 --> 01:08:32,428
Is this what we get for our tax dollars, a demise of our quality of life?

797
01:08:33,288 --> 01:08:37,670
And here's a real eye-opener, and I don't get this one at all, a 7 a.m.

798
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,131
start time for enforcement.

799
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,831
Where did that come up from 7 o'clock?

800
01:08:43,932 --> 01:08:50,655
How many people are on the road going to their jobs and typically stop at certain stores to grab a coffee, a scratch ticket, or some other commodity?

801
01:08:51,516 --> 01:08:53,437
Why are certain businesses being punished?

802
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:55,898
Hell, they'll go someplace else, and who suffers?

803
01:08:56,018 --> 01:08:56,559
We all do.

804
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:00,621
This program is lacking true parking enforcement.

805
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:02,082
Can you not see this?

806
01:09:03,162 --> 01:09:07,745
In closing, I stand by my belief and on my own as a concerned citizen

807
01:09:08,283 --> 01:09:11,985
in a former mayoral candidate and former business owner outside the city of Medford.

808
01:09:12,886 --> 01:09:13,546
This is wrong.

809
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:14,827
This is wrong.

810
01:09:15,247 --> 01:09:15,888
This is wrong.

811
01:09:16,168 --> 01:09:16,548
Thank you.

812
01:09:23,972 --> 01:09:26,314
Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

813
01:09:26,574 --> 01:09:30,556
My name is, um, Millie Casicio and I live at 289 Elm Street.

814
01:09:32,557 --> 01:09:35,380
I don't know much about this.

815
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,465
I only heard about this less than a week ago from some friends.

816
01:09:41,286 --> 01:09:44,649
I don't know if I'm pro or con the kiosk.

817
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:48,473
I know I've used one in Arlington.

818
01:09:49,214 --> 01:09:52,036
I've used one in Belmont.

819
01:09:53,252 --> 01:09:59,055
But I also, there's so many misinformation going on out there.

820
01:09:59,435 --> 01:10:02,797
I had friends tell me, I go to the senior center sometimes.

821
01:10:04,478 --> 01:10:06,098
Oh my God, they were so upset.

822
01:10:06,259 --> 01:10:15,063
First of all, every time, I don't happen to do it, but there's some people, they go there every day for their lunch.

823
01:10:16,244 --> 01:10:22,667
First of all, like, oh, they're gonna have to pay to park when they go for lunch, and they can't, now not only,

824
01:10:23,948 --> 01:10:25,668
paying after two hours.

825
01:10:26,448 --> 01:10:29,289
I said, well, you know, a lot of places you have to pay after two hours.

826
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,629
No, they have to move their cars.

827
01:10:31,709 --> 01:10:32,650
They have to get this.

828
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:38,771
Now, from what I talked to someone while I was waiting, they're not going to have to move their cars, are they?

829
01:10:39,551 --> 01:10:40,391
After two hours.

830
01:10:41,651 --> 01:10:51,233
I think that the, perhaps the most prudent thing would be once everyone's finished their remarks, the representatives of the parking management company

831
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:56,481
and also the police chief of the city of Medford will explain things to you.

832
01:10:57,021 --> 01:11:02,562
And I would suggest to you that they are the authoritative voice in these matters, rather than hearsay.

833
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:05,763
Why, I know, but this is going all over the place.

834
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:09,183
I mean, oh, and what are these people going to do?

835
01:11:09,444 --> 01:11:10,044
They can't go.

836
01:11:10,064 --> 01:11:16,105
I said, well, maybe they just need to, you know, if they feel longer, they have to pay more money.

837
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:17,145
Okay?

838
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,365
Oh, no, they have to move the cars.

839
01:11:19,385 --> 01:11:22,166
I said, I doubt that, but I don't know.

840
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:31,948
But we're going to get this information now after the whole, you know, every, especially the senior center, they're all, like, going crazy.

841
01:11:32,028 --> 01:11:33,768
Like, what are we going to do?

842
01:11:33,908 --> 01:11:35,028
What are we going to do?

843
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:42,589
And I, like I said, I knew nothing of this until less than a week ago.

844
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,450
But I knew this meeting was going to be here tonight.

845
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:50,813
And I said, let me go and see if I... And I've really, at this point, still not found out.

846
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:56,716
I don't know who says this, who says that.

847
01:11:56,736 --> 01:12:04,360
And I used to park, I worked for a while down towards the Seaport District, and it was a private

848
01:12:08,215 --> 01:12:10,336
But that's how they were, you know.

849
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:16,279
I had to go park my car, then I had to go to the kiosk, which half the time didn't work.

850
01:12:17,259 --> 01:12:23,682
Then I had to pay, then I had to get that little ticket, then I had to go back and put it inside my car.

851
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:27,743
And, you know, it was pretty cold down there sometimes.

852
01:12:28,484 --> 01:12:31,365
But there's all this misinformation going on.

853
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:36,247
And that's really why I'm here to say, you know, people have to know.

854
01:12:38,107 --> 01:12:42,469
And I have a friend that lives in Gloucester.

855
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,871
They have like four seniors.

856
01:12:46,812 --> 01:12:48,052
It's not a problem for me.

857
01:12:48,212 --> 01:12:53,735
I don't go that often, you know, and I can't get, but they have things for seniors.

858
01:12:54,887 --> 01:13:01,310
Because the people that were talking to me were saying, no, they're going to have to move their car, and they're going to pay all their money.

859
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:05,072
And I was talking to my friend, and I said, well, what are you doing?

860
01:13:05,092 --> 01:13:11,296
She said, well, if you're a senior citizen, you go to, and I don't know, you get some kind of thing to stick on your car.

861
01:13:12,036 --> 01:13:12,417
in that.

862
01:13:12,577 --> 01:13:17,602
But it's just the misinformation that's bothering me.

863
01:13:18,242 --> 01:13:19,584
I wanted to sell this stuff.

864
01:13:19,624 --> 01:13:21,405
When I got here, now I'm listening.

865
01:13:21,445 --> 01:13:25,109
I'm like, ooh, this is even worse.

866
01:13:25,429 --> 01:13:28,873
So that's what I have to say.

867
01:13:29,073 --> 01:13:29,533
Thank you.

868
01:13:29,754 --> 01:13:31,335
Thank you very much for coming up, ma'am.

869
01:13:37,659 --> 01:13:38,300
Yes, Counselor.

870
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,141
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

871
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:44,524
If we could have the chief of police or somebody from Republic answer that question.

872
01:13:44,564 --> 01:13:48,167
I know other counselors probably got an email regarding the senior center.

873
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:52,090
Can you elaborate on that so we can get those answers first?

874
01:13:52,411 --> 01:14:01,118
I mean, the senior center was always a consideration because we know how many people park there on a given day to visit the center during various hours.

875
01:14:01,518 --> 01:14:06,742
We've been trying to get the exact number or as close as possible to the exact number of vehicles involved.

876
01:14:07,308 --> 01:14:17,652
and designate an area in that lot that would be free so that they could go have their lunch, participate in the activities, as well as some of the volunteers that work there that work with the seniors.

877
01:14:17,672 --> 01:14:19,913
So that's, that's a work in progress.

878
01:14:19,953 --> 01:14:24,916
As I said, two weeks ago at the council meeting regarding the parking, there's going to be a lot of fine tuning.

879
01:14:24,956 --> 01:14:28,057
There's going to be a lot of tweaking as this goes along.

880
01:14:28,777 --> 01:14:35,060
Uh, and just based on my experience working with the, these gentlemen and others that are working, uh, staffing their office,

881
01:14:35,585 --> 01:14:43,847
They're very agreeable, they're very easy to work with, and they don't want to hurt anyone, especially when it comes to the seniors and the senior parking.

882
01:14:44,427 --> 01:14:51,368
But one thing the city has to get used to, for so many years, we've had free parking on the streets.

883
01:14:52,748 --> 01:15:03,451
And it's come time that things had to change, because the amount of vehicles, the amount of traffic, and the amount of people that are abusing the free parking privileges had to change.

884
01:15:03,911 --> 01:15:05,111
But as far as the seniors,

885
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:09,358
There is a plan in place to designate the parking.

886
01:15:09,378 --> 01:15:13,720
Just as a point of clarification, Chief, you said for years and years we've had a lot of what, free parking?

887
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:14,220
Yes.

888
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:14,740
On the streets.

889
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:15,221
That's right.

890
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:24,324
But we've also had an extreme lack of enforcement, and we wouldn't be here if the enforcement activity took place.

891
01:15:24,344 --> 01:15:28,746
That's absolutely correct, Counselor, and I'll take some of the blame for that, that there's been a lack of enforcement.

892
01:15:28,786 --> 01:15:32,347
But when we have to prioritize what we handle on a given day,

893
01:15:32,878 --> 01:15:42,165
And the lack of steady, consistent enforcement, where we don't have the number of offices to dedicate to just go street to street and write tickets, that's part of the bigger problem, the bigger issue.

894
01:15:43,326 --> 01:15:45,727
Since 2009, actually 2008 when the committee was formed,

895
01:15:48,491 --> 01:15:51,073
We went around, we got ideas from other communities.

896
01:15:51,153 --> 01:15:59,700
And I can remember every single time, no matter who I spoke to, whether it be in this building or in the community, they always use Somerville as an example.

897
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:03,202
Granted, Somerville is very effective at what they do.

898
01:16:03,242 --> 01:16:05,444
They generate $8 to $10 million a year.

899
01:16:06,305 --> 01:16:13,490
But one thing we know we don't want is to be just like Somerville, where people are hiding behind bushes just to drop a ticket on a vehicle.

900
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:18,943
And I think that we have the good mix here with, with Republic and the involvement of the city.

901
01:16:19,563 --> 01:16:21,685
So yeah, it's time.

902
01:16:21,985 --> 01:16:23,306
And now the enforcement is coming.

903
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,867
What was stated earlier about public meetings.

904
01:16:26,968 --> 01:16:36,914
We had a public meeting as Mrs. Blackburn mentioned back in May of 2009 and the recommendations went forward from that to the mayor's office.

905
01:16:37,715 --> 01:16:38,976
And that went in October of 2009.

906
01:16:39,676 --> 01:16:44,540
And one of the recommendations was that some form of parking control device be on the street.

907
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,462
And at that time, kiosks were mentioned.

908
01:16:47,923 --> 01:16:52,966
And we know that there were some people that may not have been on the committee that favored kiosks.

909
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:55,248
But the technology wasn't there.

910
01:16:55,548 --> 01:17:00,632
Here we are five years later, or just about five years later, the technology has improved so much.

911
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:02,994
And it's less damage on the street.

912
01:17:03,474 --> 01:17:07,397
If you put single head meters all over the place, you'd be destroying the sidewalks up and down.

913
01:17:07,986 --> 01:17:11,088
When it comes to snow removal, the meters and poles will be knocked down.

914
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:25,178
When one kiosk can handle 10 or 12 vehicles, and you don't have to pay and display, you get the receipt, you put the receipt in your pocket, and you walk away, and you save that just as it is as a receipt, if in fact at some point you get a ticket.

915
01:17:25,759 --> 01:17:27,660
So there's a lot of things that took place.

916
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:33,725
But also, the Office of Community Development held a meeting in this room in March, and I believe it was March 31st,

917
01:17:34,865 --> 01:17:41,649
2010 a public meeting that asked for the public's involvement and input for parking needs in Medford square.

918
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:44,551
So they asked the business community and they asked the public.

919
01:17:45,372 --> 01:17:47,994
I'm not sure of the attendance of that point of information.

920
01:17:48,074 --> 01:17:50,735
Counselor marks chief.

921
01:17:50,995 --> 01:18:00,922
I think the issue is that when we had the public hearing back in 2009 it was to get input on eventually trying to create a parking management program in the city.

922
01:18:01,871 --> 01:18:06,933
What people are asking now is there's been no and the mayor's pay for parking plan.

923
01:18:07,593 --> 01:18:09,393
So there's been no public hearing chief.

924
01:18:09,533 --> 01:18:11,654
I mean, you could talk about a second meeting.

925
01:18:12,014 --> 01:18:17,196
That meeting wasn't regarding the mayor's plan that was being laid out chief at the time, if you recall.

926
01:18:17,476 --> 01:18:25,078
No, but I think if you look at the recommendations that were submitted, almost every one of them has something to do with the program that's going forward this month.

927
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:30,560
Chief pointed further clarification in the report that you folks submitted.

928
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:31,779
on page number two.

929
01:18:32,428 --> 01:18:40,330
Third paragraph, first line, if parking is a major problem in the city, then a necessary first step in taking that enforcement needs to be seriously taken.

930
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:48,592
Last sentence, what was realized was the steady, consistent enforcement was necessary where all violations and violators were treated the same.

931
01:18:48,912 --> 01:18:57,334
That's 2009, this is 2014, that's five years later, this mayor's been here and for five years he's done nothing about traffic enforcement.

932
01:18:57,634 --> 01:19:02,195
Now he wants to beat the people up and make this a revenue enhancement program and that's

933
01:19:02,615 --> 01:19:09,579
That's not what the report's about.

934
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:15,842
All I can say is going forward from that 2009 report, we did recommend some form of meter control on the streets.

935
01:19:15,862 --> 01:19:17,523
That was the number one?

936
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:19,244
Recommendation number four, I believe.

937
01:19:20,724 --> 01:19:21,665
Thank you, Chief.

938
01:19:21,725 --> 01:19:22,565
Counselor Camuso.

939
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:23,106
To the Chief.

940
01:19:23,146 --> 01:19:24,006
Waited patiently.

941
01:19:24,686 --> 01:19:25,267
Thank you, Chief.

942
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:28,528
And I'm just a little confused because I'm hearing some different things.

943
01:19:30,296 --> 01:19:30,456
Ms.

944
01:19:30,496 --> 01:19:39,981
Blackburn, well respected in our community, her years of service in the school department, Councilor Marks, yourself, Marguerite Lynch, Anthony Santoro sat on the original committee back in 2009.

945
01:19:40,021 --> 01:19:42,242
That's correct.

946
01:19:42,302 --> 01:19:43,743
Well, 2008 into 2009.

947
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:47,244
And I went back to some of my old archive records.

948
01:19:48,245 --> 01:19:54,968
The recommendations were the agreement consensus that consistent parking enforcement is needed to provide efficient turnover.

949
01:19:55,386 --> 01:19:57,772
for pocket spaces to assist the local businesses.

950
01:19:58,233 --> 01:20:01,861
And one of the members actually was on there as a representative of the Chamber of Commerce at the time.

951
01:20:02,262 --> 01:20:04,287
It's like any other agency or group.

952
01:20:04,977 --> 01:20:07,938
turn over, so that's who was sitting there at the time.

953
01:20:07,978 --> 01:20:15,541
Number two was this particular group recommended parking controls are needed, meters slash kiosks, freestanding pay stations.

954
01:20:15,621 --> 01:20:17,681
That was number two for the recommendations.

955
01:20:18,142 --> 01:20:21,543
And it goes on to say that the parking rules must be fair and consistently enforced.

956
01:20:23,283 --> 01:20:24,864
Now this was back in 2009.

957
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,625
Leading up to this, I know there was a first bid that went out

958
01:20:28,798 --> 01:20:34,442
that consisted of parking enforcement with a parking garage element at Medford Square.

959
01:20:35,082 --> 01:20:38,945
There wasn't the votes on the Medford City Council to support the garage at the time.

960
01:20:39,305 --> 01:20:43,928
We actually have members that don't even sit on the council anymore that were here for that particular.

961
01:20:45,638 --> 01:20:59,714
those particular discussions and I would have rather have seen the garage built with strict enforcement and then look at other areas but as far as all the recommendations it looks like a lot of them

962
01:21:00,515 --> 01:21:01,516
are with this plan.

963
01:21:01,896 --> 01:21:12,563
Now leading up to that, one thing that I disagree with totally on the mayor's plan is, and I said this at the Committee of the Whole meeting back in January, I would have rather seen the freestanding meters.

964
01:21:12,903 --> 01:21:14,725
I think senior citizens know how to use them.

965
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:27,073
They're much more, they're much more user-friendly, but I also see the total other side of it where, up near Tufts University now,

966
01:21:28,165 --> 01:21:35,150
People that are living in our community and utilizing up there, everyone, they don't even go into a coffee shop without cash anymore.

967
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:37,993
Everything is debit card, credit card driven.

968
01:21:38,373 --> 01:21:43,717
But there is the technology out there that could be standalone meters with kiosks.

969
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:47,140
And I made that loud and clear known at the meeting in January.

970
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:50,342
It was actually part of the committee report that was adopted.

971
01:21:50,622 --> 01:21:52,104
But as I said that evening,

972
01:21:52,842 --> 01:22:20,637
we're making recommendations to the mayor and ultimately this council gave him the authority to go out and up to a ten-year contract by a seven to nothing vote uh... and it leads us back to ultimately given the fact that he's the mayor duly elected by the majority of this community he is the signatory authority uh... at moving any contracts forward so uh... that was really the only piece that this city council had a hand in what i'd like to see them go the route with the

973
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,361
quarter meters that you just throw in that people have been using.

974
01:22:24,701 --> 01:22:30,263
I remember the quarter meters over in Somerville or over in Charlestown when we were little kids going to get shoes.

975
01:22:30,544 --> 01:22:32,004
You'd throw a quarter in the meter back then.

976
01:22:32,524 --> 01:22:33,425
People knew how to use them.

977
01:22:33,445 --> 01:22:34,485
They're so user friendly.

978
01:22:34,945 --> 01:22:43,309
But I just think there could have been more public, leading up to this now, the rollout I think could have been publicized more.

979
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:45,390
This piece of paper is very informative.

980
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,951
I think it should have been in the hands a little bit sooner.

981
01:22:48,405 --> 01:22:52,547
The other recommendation I would have liked to have seen is started it not in the middle of the winter.

982
01:22:53,127 --> 01:22:55,929
Start it when it's nice out so that people could go up to a machine.

983
01:22:55,949 --> 01:23:01,912
And right now, I mean, I couldn't even carry my tea in tonight because it was so cold going from the car to here.

984
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:07,975
If I had to run to a kiosk, I'd rather just get the ticket and pay it, I think, because it was so cold out there.

985
01:23:08,335 --> 01:23:10,076
But the fact of the matter is,

986
01:23:11,525 --> 01:23:16,530
I think the city has to continue doing outreach, utilizing the 911.

987
01:23:17,772 --> 01:23:20,915
We get phone calls to say they just put the chalk lines on the baseball field.

988
01:23:22,136 --> 01:23:24,599
This is something big that we should be getting three or four calls on.

989
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:26,901
The outreach, the outreach, the outreach.

990
01:23:28,985 --> 01:23:32,828
The other thing that I'd like to bring up is just to say how we got here.

991
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:38,672
This was an initial recommendation of several members of our community that had many recommendations.

992
01:23:39,213 --> 01:23:44,396
And after it went from here, the original commission, yourself, Councilor Marks, Ms.

993
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:47,679
Blackburn, and other people, at that point, it was in the hands of the mayor.

994
01:23:48,519 --> 01:23:49,160
And it sat there.

995
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:55,044
And then it came back to us at one portion just to give the authority to do the 10-year contract.

996
01:23:56,853 --> 01:24:07,835
I just wanna be clear to the people out there that, and you gotta remember too, the last time the halls were this, it was over the trash removal and the recycling bins.

997
01:24:09,396 --> 01:24:12,116
But given time, people did get in the groove.

998
01:24:12,136 --> 01:24:25,239
I'd like to think that the individual needs of areas like Jimmy's Pizza, areas like the senior center, I'm not singling out Jimmy's Pizza, but you know, the business communities in South Medford.

999
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:28,535
Let's be cognizant when we're putting in those free spaces.

1000
01:24:28,836 --> 01:24:30,082
If we have to add a couple more.

1001
01:24:30,897 --> 01:24:34,019
so that people can run in and do their business and get out right away.

1002
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:42,545
But I'll be the first one to say, the person that takes that spot for 15 minutes, if it's a 15-minute spot to do a quick errand, and they're there 16 minutes, shame on them.

1003
01:24:42,585 --> 01:24:46,868
They should get double the ticket, because the next person should have the 15 minutes and the 15 minutes.

1004
01:24:48,409 --> 01:24:50,951
So I'd just like to get a commitment.

1005
01:24:51,631 --> 01:24:55,694
Not a commitment, I understand you can't, but that things will be tweaked and looked at.

1006
01:24:56,495 --> 01:24:59,277
Because there is stuff, like you said, the senior center, just last week,

1007
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:01,848
that was thought about.

1008
01:25:01,868 --> 01:25:04,230
And there's going to be other areas that you think about.

1009
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:09,675
The other thing that's very, very important, places of worship in all the funeral parlors in our community.

1010
01:25:10,035 --> 01:25:11,436
I actually did some research on this.

1011
01:25:12,217 --> 01:25:20,203
Those meters, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think this is very important for the people in our community that practice their faith and their religious beliefs.

1012
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,301
venues that they will be bagged.

1013
01:25:24,481 --> 01:25:31,084
There'll be an actual bag or something all over it on the weekends that says, uh, masks don't whatever the case may be.

1014
01:25:31,304 --> 01:25:34,046
And the mayor has assured me that that will take place.

1015
01:25:34,086 --> 01:25:35,166
Are you under that impression as well?

1016
01:25:35,206 --> 01:25:37,487
They're bagged or they're just not enforced during that time.

1017
01:25:37,808 --> 01:25:42,950
I've been assured that any of the wakes, any funerals, the consideration will be given.

1018
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:46,412
Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, Rhonda Franzo was, uh,

1019
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:52,402
an unofficial committee member.

1020
01:25:52,583 --> 01:26:00,748
He was aware of what was going forward and he's been totally agreeable as long as he could be assured that if he had a service going on at his facility.

1021
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,721
that it would be okay.

1022
01:26:02,861 --> 01:26:05,684
And as I said before, the Republic folks are good about that.

1023
01:26:06,344 --> 01:26:07,185
Not a problem with that.

1024
01:26:07,225 --> 01:26:09,547
Not a problem at school pickup for St.

1025
01:26:09,567 --> 01:26:12,790
Joseph's, uh, drop off and pick up at St.

1026
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:13,190
Joseph's.

1027
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:16,993
Any of those things are more of a common sense way of doing the business.

1028
01:26:17,374 --> 01:26:28,964
And the other thing that, um, that I'm glad the mayor listened to this council on, cause I actually made a recommendation, um, back when we had another piece of this whole puzzle, the other area where the city council was involved, it was the language.

1029
01:26:29,403 --> 01:26:35,726
to combine two of the commissions and give the authority to one commission rather than an off-street parking commission and a traffic commission.

1030
01:26:36,046 --> 01:26:38,047
You get too many hands in the soup, the soup gets spoiled.

1031
01:26:38,487 --> 01:26:44,330
So we successfully, as a council, passed that, sent it to the state house, the governor signed it, and it came back.

1032
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:50,784
But one recommendation that I made, and it's in the official records, were to have resident parking only commuters.

1033
01:26:51,244 --> 01:26:58,789
Because too many people from Winchester, not only some of them are coming down here and taking spots, they're leaving their trash in our trash barrels because they have to go to dump in Winchester.

1034
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:00,350
And that is totally unacceptable.

1035
01:27:00,811 --> 01:27:07,295
And quite honestly, it's larceny, as far as I'm concerned, or illegal dumping, because it's our taxpayers that are footing the bill on that.

1036
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,677
But it is up to this point.

1037
01:27:10,237 --> 01:27:11,718
I do see some tweaking getting done.

1038
01:27:12,198 --> 01:27:23,125
which I think people have to understand that this is slow process, similar to the trash barrel situation where I had more phone calls on the trash barrel, similar to this situation, and how many people were going to need three, four, five barrels.

1039
01:27:23,545 --> 01:27:28,388
And if you talk to the DPW, there's not many households that actually purchased the additional barrel at the time.

1040
01:27:28,828 --> 01:27:35,112
But in Winchester, Winchester is totally expanding their program right now.

1041
01:27:36,282 --> 01:27:36,843
as we speak.

1042
01:27:37,323 --> 01:27:42,150
They just put their brand new kiosks in Winchester Center, and actually our kiosks are better.

1043
01:27:43,652 --> 01:27:47,216
I haven't used one yet, but at least the numbers are bigger.

1044
01:27:47,537 --> 01:27:49,459
In Winchester, the keypad is tiny.

1045
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:50,832
It's tiny.

1046
01:27:50,892 --> 01:27:57,557
And I know this, this council wanted to make sure that everything was ADA compliant and the mayor is very serious when it comes to that stuff too, as, as yourself.

1047
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:01,320
But, um, that's, that's all I really have to say at this point.

1048
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:10,487
But, uh, I just, what I stated regarding the initial report, pretty fairly accurate because I'm hearing different things that, that that committee never wanted kiosk meters.

1049
01:28:10,547 --> 01:28:13,549
But now when you look at it, it's actually one of the recommendations.

1050
01:28:14,049 --> 01:28:17,872
So I just, just, just to clarify that piece, I think initially the committee itself,

1051
01:28:19,071 --> 01:28:21,792
you know, we were looking at, okay, we had a lot of signage out there.

1052
01:28:21,812 --> 01:28:22,852
We had a lot of time limit.

1053
01:28:22,892 --> 01:28:28,214
We could have done time limit enforcement, but every community we went to, they had some form of device on the street.

1054
01:28:28,274 --> 01:28:32,895
And most of them had the meters at the time because the kiosks weren't as reliable as they are today.

1055
01:28:33,816 --> 01:28:46,720
Uh, but when we had the public meeting, I'm not sure if you have that piece of that document when we had the public meeting, the majority of people, if not, I think barring two people who were in attendance that night, a lot of support,

1056
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:54,166
all wanted some sort of meters or some sort of control on the streets and then enforcement of those meters.

1057
01:28:54,927 --> 01:28:59,271
And I have the notes here that Alvar Erickson had typed up from that meeting.

1058
01:28:59,331 --> 01:29:05,177
And almost everyone, there were two that were against meters and parking enforcement in total.

1059
01:29:05,797 --> 01:29:08,339
And everybody else wanted to see some sort of

1060
01:29:09,564 --> 01:29:12,606
control device on the street, whether it be a meter, whether it be a kiosk.

1061
01:29:12,626 --> 01:29:14,367
And at the time, the push was meters.

1062
01:29:14,627 --> 01:29:17,028
The push was meters, because we didn't know what a kiosk was.

1063
01:29:17,048 --> 01:29:20,450
So that was what it was at the time.

1064
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:21,911
But now, you know, time has passed.

1065
01:29:21,951 --> 01:29:25,793
Here we are almost five years later, and the technology has improved so much.

1066
01:29:26,274 --> 01:29:27,654
And the kiosk gives you — The Press.

1067
01:29:28,195 --> 01:29:30,016
Point of information, Counselor Marks.

1068
01:29:30,596 --> 01:29:35,479
I just want to make sure that Counselor Camuso just outlined the process since 2009.

1069
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:39,021
But maybe just unintentionally,

1070
01:29:39,598 --> 01:29:43,861
Between 2009 and today, the mayor appointed another committee.

1071
01:29:44,721 --> 01:29:45,642
Oh, yeah, City Hall employees.

1072
01:29:45,722 --> 01:29:48,043
Well, that hasn't been mentioned at all.

1073
01:29:48,604 --> 01:29:49,564
Well, because it's his ball, I say.

1074
01:29:49,604 --> 01:29:52,106
Well, I'm just saying, the mayor appointed another committee.

1075
01:29:52,786 --> 01:29:55,408
That committee consisted of all his department heads.

1076
01:29:55,468 --> 01:29:55,828
We know that.

1077
01:29:56,249 --> 01:30:05,395
So not one person, I didn't sit on the committee, Gwen didn't sit on the committee, Ron DeFranco didn't sit on the committee, Anthony Santoro didn't sit on the committee.

1078
01:30:05,415 --> 01:30:06,775
These were department heads.

1079
01:30:07,196 --> 01:30:08,697
And the mayor devised a plan.

1080
01:30:09,717 --> 01:30:18,083
So I don't think it's accurate to sit back and say, based on recommendations that were made five years ago, that this is how the mayor went forward.

1081
01:30:18,403 --> 01:30:19,824
Because that's not what took place.

1082
01:30:20,144 --> 01:30:24,948
The mayor went forward working in a vacuum in his office with his department heads.

1083
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:27,349
with no input from anyone.

1084
01:30:27,369 --> 01:30:28,390
And that's what we're seeing here tonight.

1085
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:29,230
I think I stated that.

1086
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:31,591
Well, you might have stated that, but you've been supporting this from day one.

1087
01:30:31,651 --> 01:30:33,472
Now, all of a sudden, you're giving it a change of heart.

1088
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:33,992
No, no, no.

1089
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,393
Counselor, it's not a recommendation to bring leaders in.

1090
01:30:35,413 --> 01:30:36,074
You've got a crowd up here.

1091
01:30:36,094 --> 01:30:37,174
You've got to change your heart now.

1092
01:30:37,374 --> 01:30:41,716
Counselor, with all due respect, I took the same exact votes in this whole program as you and every other member of this council.

1093
01:30:41,757 --> 01:30:43,698
So, Mr. President, just if I could finish.

1094
01:30:43,718 --> 01:30:45,098
Clarification is our issue.

1095
01:30:45,118 --> 01:30:46,439
Just if I could point.

1096
01:30:46,459 --> 01:30:53,763
The two major issues with this is that when we as a committee met, and Gwen can speak for herself,

1097
01:30:54,523 --> 01:31:01,125
When we discussed about who was gonna do the enforcement, every discussion was in-house personnel.

1098
01:31:01,545 --> 01:31:04,726
It was our crossing guards, it was retired police.

1099
01:31:05,146 --> 01:31:08,667
The mayor took the proposal and outsourced 95% of this.

1100
01:31:08,987 --> 01:31:11,427
So that's a major part that the mayor changed.

1101
01:31:12,287 --> 01:31:12,848
Major part.

1102
01:31:13,408 --> 01:31:14,148
Just my other point.

1103
01:31:15,685 --> 01:31:20,747
The other point, as the Chief mentioned, and Ron DeFranco, who's on the committee, also mentioned, and Gwen mentioned.

1104
01:31:20,807 --> 01:31:21,827
Ron DeFranco was not on the committee.

1105
01:31:22,107 --> 01:31:23,008
Yes, he was on the committee.

1106
01:31:23,048 --> 01:31:24,148
He was an ex-officio member.

1107
01:31:24,168 --> 01:31:24,908
He was on the committee.

1108
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:27,289
You didn't attend any of the meetings, so don't talk like you did.

1109
01:31:27,309 --> 01:31:28,990
You're the one that brought the meetings to the city.

1110
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:29,970
Don't talk like you've been there.

1111
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:31,311
If we could make this point.

1112
01:31:31,471 --> 01:31:33,372
If I could, Mr. President.

1113
01:31:33,612 --> 01:31:42,555
And the second big issue, one was the outsourcing, and the second was that we as a committee wanted steady enforcement, parking enforcement,

1114
01:31:42,835 --> 01:31:44,235
with the existing signage.

1115
01:31:44,615 --> 01:31:49,497
The mayor took that around, wrapped it around, and made it a pay for parking enforcement.

1116
01:31:49,917 --> 01:31:58,379
So the two major components were thought up in the mayor's committee with his department heads and had nothing to do with our committee.

1117
01:31:58,619 --> 01:32:02,380
And we have a committee member that was here tonight that can attest to that.

1118
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,040
And Ron DeFranco mentioned that.

1119
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:12,602
So I don't like the fact that the mayor is looking now for a scapegoat to blame anyone on this parking when he should look in the mirror and he can see himself, Mr. President.

1120
01:32:13,142 --> 01:32:16,825
Thank you.

1121
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:20,067
Councillor Camuso, if you'd like to complete your remarks.

1122
01:32:20,287 --> 01:32:20,527
Thank you.

1123
01:32:20,647 --> 01:32:21,748
I can conclude with two things.

1124
01:32:21,788 --> 01:32:29,153
And just to follow up on what Councillor Mack said, and I did say that after the recommendations came by his committee for all these recommendations, it was in the mayor's hands.

1125
01:32:29,573 --> 01:32:31,354
He's the signatory authority and the only one.

1126
01:32:31,814 --> 01:32:36,177
And to say that I supported it and now I'm not, we all supported it.

1127
01:32:36,237 --> 01:32:39,879
Seven members of this council gave, had our- I didn't support this language.

1128
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,141
We didn't have- I didn't support this language.

1129
01:32:43,217 --> 01:32:45,979
Councilor Penta, if you could make a point of clarification.

1130
01:32:45,999 --> 01:32:55,184
All the council voted for was to authorize the mayor to go forward and look into a 10-year contract because we had three people come.

1131
01:32:55,665 --> 01:32:57,406
All three of them had a 10-year proposal.

1132
01:32:57,546 --> 01:33:02,889
It was over a three-year minimum for which the procurement officer said these are what the people had to come in with.

1133
01:33:03,607 --> 01:33:10,829
and the council voted with an amendment that the council meet before the signing so that we have a complete understanding.

1134
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:20,311
And I further amended it by saying that having the mayor, whoever the vendor might be, present themselves before the council before the finalization of the contract.

1135
01:33:20,551 --> 01:33:25,552
So before the finalization of the contract to me means before that contract is signed.

1136
01:33:25,812 --> 01:33:32,814
And if we don't agree or something has to be changed, we never have the opportunity to take the vote or discuss anything about a finalization.

1137
01:33:33,754 --> 01:33:37,215
And, I tell you, it's on the record.

1138
01:33:37,816 --> 01:33:40,236
It's clearly on the record, as clear as the bell.

1139
01:33:40,697 --> 01:33:41,797
Thank you, Councilor Padgett.

1140
01:33:42,077 --> 01:33:44,978
Councilor Camuso has the floor, and then Councilor Caraviello.

1141
01:33:44,998 --> 01:33:46,399
Just two last things.

1142
01:33:46,659 --> 01:33:50,560
In the last few days, I had several members of our community reach out to me about the signs on the trees.

1143
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:57,863
I worked with the DPW today, as well as the Mayor's office, and all the signs have been removed from the trees, and

1144
01:33:58,803 --> 01:34:02,184
Unfortunately, I know Councilor Marks over the years, this has been something he's been a stickler about.

1145
01:34:02,785 --> 01:34:07,607
But some of the existing signs that were, they took down and put them over that.

1146
01:34:07,847 --> 01:34:09,207
They were never removed in the first place.

1147
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:12,909
So shame on the city for allowing them to linger up there.

1148
01:34:13,549 --> 01:34:14,610
Point of clarification.

1149
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:15,550
Further clarification.

1150
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:16,451
On that particular motion.

1151
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:24,099
On that particular issue, excuse me, I have pictures of every tree that was bolted by a sign.

1152
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:31,161
If the mayor was on top of his game, they would have known right from the beginning never to put a sign on a tree to start off with.

1153
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:31,881
Okay.

1154
01:34:32,521 --> 01:34:35,042
There was no communication, not even with the mayor to them.

1155
01:34:36,062 --> 01:34:42,904
I'm not yelling at you because you know something, this is such a disruptive piece of legislation that we shouldn't even be discussing this.

1156
01:34:43,224 --> 01:34:45,964
The mayor should be in here apologizing and saying,

1157
01:34:53,227 --> 01:35:14,676
last but not least we have business owners in this community that have consistently parked their vehicles in front of their stores year after year after year and you know what the only people that suffer are them and the consumers when they pull up and they have to park three miles away because you got an ice cream store or you have a vendor

1158
01:35:15,741 --> 01:35:17,122
I mean, they don't even try to disguise it.

1159
01:35:17,943 --> 01:35:22,608
The name of the companies on the side of the truck that sits out there all day long, or the car that sits out there all day long.

1160
01:35:23,188 --> 01:35:36,181
I think, I think today driving through the squares, I think some of the business owners now are taking the appropriate steps to leave the spots for the consumers, like us, when we show up.

1161
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:42,262
I think they're already seeing an impact, because you got good business in the community, like the guys that are sitting out here.

1162
01:35:43,543 --> 01:35:48,826
They'll go deliver some food and then park their car half a mile away so that somebody can park in front of their store.

1163
01:35:49,347 --> 01:35:52,528
There's not many people that do that, I hate to say, throughout our squares.

1164
01:35:52,849 --> 01:35:57,411
And it's obvious, because half the trucks are leaded that say the name of the business and everything else.

1165
01:35:58,112 --> 01:35:59,192
So that's it for now.

1166
01:35:59,552 --> 01:36:01,694
Thank you, Counselor Kamuso.

1167
01:36:02,054 --> 01:36:03,595
Counselor Karifiello.

1168
01:36:03,715 --> 01:36:04,555
Thank you, Mr. President.

1169
01:36:05,016 --> 01:36:07,317
Chief, a couple of concerns I have.

1170
01:36:07,952 --> 01:36:11,235
timeframe, uh, who decided on seven to seven?

1171
01:36:12,236 --> 01:36:14,458
I mean, I don't see many communities.

1172
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:19,203
I'll stab at the seven to seven piece only because I believe that's what the existing signage had said.

1173
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:26,190
And that just any signs that were replaced were replaced with the, uh, the wording of pretty much of the existing signage.

1174
01:36:28,204 --> 01:36:33,147
I don't honestly believe that parking control officers will be out there at 7 a.m.

1175
01:36:33,327 --> 01:36:38,730
And I know that they plan on staggering hours so that they can cover the entire city.

1176
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:43,994
One of my concerns, I'd like to see the time be changed to 8, at least 8 to 6 or something.

1177
01:36:44,534 --> 01:36:49,197
But that 7 to 7, people are very concerned about the early morning people who are out.

1178
01:36:49,997 --> 01:36:53,340
And that's been a huge concern of mine with the 7 to 7.

1179
01:36:55,995 --> 01:36:57,496
I say, I, you know, I'm around everywhere.

1180
01:36:57,816 --> 01:36:59,297
I don't see any city that has seven o'clock.

1181
01:37:00,097 --> 01:37:02,319
I mean, you know, eight, nine in Boston.

1182
01:37:02,799 --> 01:37:17,648
Um, chief, another thing is, um, and I don't know if this is a question for you, but you know, we're, we're in the winter now and when the plows are coming out and the plowing, I mean, you know, we've all, we've all lived in this community.

1183
01:37:18,588 --> 01:37:23,291
The snow mounds pile up to be three or four feet high and you know, and they're not,

1184
01:37:23,775 --> 01:37:26,878
and all the sidewalks aren't shoveled in the business areas.

1185
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:33,805
Who's going to shovel these kiosks over these people to get over that?

1186
01:37:33,985 --> 01:37:36,148
I don't know if that's yours or the question for these gentlemen.

1187
01:37:36,168 --> 01:37:37,429
There will be a combined effort.

1188
01:37:37,549 --> 01:37:39,451
I'd turn it over to the gentleman from Republic.

1189
01:37:39,511 --> 01:37:44,016
I think it's a combined effort between the Department of Public Works and Republic.

1190
01:37:44,056 --> 01:37:46,238
And I just know that during a snowstorm,

1191
01:37:46,999 --> 01:37:48,480
there'll be no enforcement of those.

1192
01:37:50,362 --> 01:37:52,924
It's after the snow and you had several feet.

1193
01:37:53,004 --> 01:37:59,689
I mean, you know, I mean, I, I mean, you see people, you know, the store owners cut a hole this big for, you know, maybe, you know, a little walkway.

1194
01:38:00,309 --> 01:38:09,016
So I mean, either, either the city is going to have to clean up the sidewalks because you can't expect people to have to climb over three feet of snow to put money in.

1195
01:38:10,578 --> 01:38:12,459
I mean, can the gentleman answer that?

1196
01:38:12,499 --> 01:38:13,640
Maybe, maybe he can answer that question.

1197
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:21,853
Addressing the snow issue, if there is... Could you please state your name and address for the record, please, sir?

1198
01:38:21,873 --> 01:38:22,113
I'm sorry.

1199
01:38:22,433 --> 01:38:24,674
Jack Skelton, Republic Parking System.

1200
01:38:24,714 --> 01:38:26,095
I'm a vice president with the company.

1201
01:38:27,256 --> 01:38:28,336
I thank you for coming out here tonight.

1202
01:38:28,496 --> 01:38:29,177
I'm glad to be here.

1203
01:38:29,817 --> 01:38:34,600
In a snow situation, if the kiosks are unreachable because of snow, there will be no enforcement.

1204
01:38:35,008 --> 01:38:38,770
but the plan is to have them dug out as quickly as possible after a storm.

1205
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:41,691
We deal with this in many cities across the Northeast.

1206
01:38:41,771 --> 01:38:42,512
Now, who does it dig out?

1207
01:38:42,552 --> 01:38:43,332
You or us?

1208
01:38:43,652 --> 01:38:44,953
We'll be working with public works.

1209
01:38:45,173 --> 01:38:45,433
Okay.

1210
01:38:45,954 --> 01:38:56,239
Um, another question, which is everyone's asking about is there's multiple stories about handicapped parking going all of the city, how long you can stay where you can stay, where you can't stay.

1211
01:38:56,259 --> 01:38:59,040
Um, can you explain the handicap issue?

1212
01:38:59,340 --> 01:38:59,560
Sure.

1213
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:04,503
By state statute, handicapped parking is not to be charged for on the street at all.

1214
01:39:05,201 --> 01:39:12,568
Now, if I understand this right, because some of my family has a handicapper, you can put as long as they're parked in a legal spot, correct?

1215
01:39:12,868 --> 01:39:13,268
Correct.

1216
01:39:13,349 --> 01:39:16,872
They cannot block a driveway or a fire hydrant or something like that.

1217
01:39:17,232 --> 01:39:21,476
But as long as they have their placard properly displayed, they will not be issued a citation.

1218
01:39:22,277 --> 01:39:28,520
Uh, if they forget their placard and they're happy to be issued a citation, they can come into the office and we'll take care of it with proof of the placard.

1219
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:28,881
No.

1220
01:39:29,701 --> 01:39:37,605
Are they subject to the same two hour constraints or one hour, whatever they have to be, or can, can I, can my wife park there all day?

1221
01:39:39,146 --> 01:39:43,728
The, they're expected to maintain the two hour time limit, just like every other citizen would say.

1222
01:39:43,769 --> 01:39:50,172
Now there's some, there's a lot of confusion going around about some people think is that they have a handicap pocket that they're going to be able to park there all day.

1223
01:39:51,466 --> 01:39:54,168
Those ordinance that part of the ordinance has not been changed.

1224
01:39:54,428 --> 01:39:54,669
Okay.

1225
01:39:54,709 --> 01:39:59,272
So, so they can only park for whatever the two hours or one hour or whatever.

1226
01:39:59,633 --> 01:40:00,574
Is that chief?

1227
01:40:00,614 --> 01:40:01,174
Is that correct?

1228
01:40:01,194 --> 01:40:08,160
Is that what we're going to bring the same information that you had counselor?

1229
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,823
It was my understanding that they would not, they could pack all day.

1230
01:40:12,784 --> 01:40:14,845
They're not held to the same time limit requirement.

1231
01:40:14,985 --> 01:40:16,266
That's just my understanding.

1232
01:40:16,286 --> 01:40:18,108
And they could pack in any legal packing spot.

1233
01:40:19,059 --> 01:40:20,680
So they can park all day or they can't park all day?

1234
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,741
That has to be determined.

1235
01:40:24,162 --> 01:40:33,626
I have to look up the law and talk with the folks at the Registry of Motor Vehicles that issue the placards.

1236
01:40:33,706 --> 01:40:41,530
I think part of the problem is there's a lot of misinformation going around, especially on that issue.

1237
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,491
What about the loading zone issue?

1238
01:40:45,317 --> 01:40:45,977
The loading zone?

1239
01:40:46,137 --> 01:40:49,639
Yes, I'm getting a lot of businesses asking about the loading zone areas.

1240
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:57,382
How long can I park my, I own a store in the square and I park in the loading zone.

1241
01:40:57,722 --> 01:40:59,963
How long am I allowed to stay in that loading zone?

1242
01:40:59,983 --> 01:41:02,083
There are no real loading zones in Medford Square.

1243
01:41:02,263 --> 01:41:03,104
Well, not in the square, but other.

1244
01:41:03,124 --> 01:41:04,244
No designated loading zones.

1245
01:41:04,284 --> 01:41:05,745
The loading zone in West Medford Square.

1246
01:41:05,765 --> 01:41:07,746
Well, there's one in West Medford.

1247
01:41:07,766 --> 01:41:13,788
It was not posted properly to start with, but it was a commercial vehicle is 15 minutes

1248
01:41:14,773 --> 01:41:17,954
And passenger vehicle was five minutes, so they could run in and run out.

1249
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:22,036
There's not a loading zone that's supposed to be an all-day parking.

1250
01:41:22,056 --> 01:41:23,137
In Westlake, there is a loading zone.

1251
01:41:23,157 --> 01:41:24,057
There is a sign that says loading zone.

1252
01:41:24,077 --> 01:41:25,197
But it's not supposed to be all-day parking.

1253
01:41:25,217 --> 01:41:25,798
What I'm saying is.

1254
01:41:25,878 --> 01:41:27,038
So the loading zone.

1255
01:41:27,598 --> 01:41:28,179
Drop off.

1256
01:41:28,199 --> 01:41:28,959
15 minutes.

1257
01:41:28,999 --> 01:41:30,299
You didn't get out.

1258
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:32,460
15 minutes for commercial, five minutes for passenger.

1259
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,602
15 minutes for commercial, and five minutes for.

1260
01:41:35,922 --> 01:41:39,963
And the same thing will be taking place at the hillside at Boston and Winthrop.

1261
01:41:40,164 --> 01:41:40,784
Point of information.

1262
01:41:41,328 --> 01:41:42,728
Point of information, counselor.

1263
01:41:42,748 --> 01:41:50,091
You're telling me in that loading zone up on the hillside, somebody goes in there, they're going to have, and they want to get some paint and they have to stir the paint and shake it up.

1264
01:41:50,111 --> 01:41:51,151
They have to be out in five minutes.

1265
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:52,011
They're going to get a ticket.

1266
01:41:53,052 --> 01:41:53,452
Five minutes.

1267
01:41:53,472 --> 01:41:55,232
You just said we have to be reasonable.

1268
01:41:55,272 --> 01:41:57,113
Well, that's the whole thing about being reasonable here.

1269
01:41:57,813 --> 01:42:01,254
Why are we discussing all this?

1270
01:42:01,354 --> 01:42:03,375
Point of information, a loading zone.

1271
01:42:03,755 --> 01:42:09,777
My understanding is for doing deliveries to the company or the company doing a quick pickup and heading out.

1272
01:42:09,977 --> 01:42:10,197
Correct.

1273
01:42:10,492 --> 01:42:11,812
It's not for customers, it's a loading zone.

1274
01:42:11,852 --> 01:42:16,773
But the nature of a certain business, if it's one of those... No, but he's talking about getting paint shaken up.

1275
01:42:16,793 --> 01:42:19,053
That's a customer going in and getting paint shaken up.

1276
01:42:19,214 --> 01:42:19,934
It's a loading zone.

1277
01:42:20,054 --> 01:42:23,554
He just said for commercial and residential purposes.

1278
01:42:23,634 --> 01:42:28,595
Well, I challenge you to go up there and buy some paint and see if you get a ticket when you come out, because that's not the purpose of a loading zone.

1279
01:42:29,835 --> 01:42:30,235
Thank you.

1280
01:42:30,435 --> 01:42:31,916
Points both well received.

1281
01:42:31,976 --> 01:42:33,956
The floor goes back to Councillor Kerrio.

1282
01:42:36,256 --> 01:42:39,277
All these municipal lots, again, misinformation.

1283
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:47,886
I'm hearing that the lot in Medford Square behind on Governor's Ave is now business only.

1284
01:42:48,086 --> 01:42:50,007
Absolutely not, absolutely not.

1285
01:42:50,067 --> 01:42:50,728
Is that gonna be?

1286
01:42:51,228 --> 01:42:56,513
The restriction that's there today is the restriction that was there last year and the year before.

1287
01:42:56,893 --> 01:43:01,417
Business parking along the wall that goes up against 15 Governor's Ave.

1288
01:43:01,797 --> 01:43:08,863
I've been told by people in the square that, you know, your people are telling them, don't worry, park your car in the lot there.

1289
01:43:09,413 --> 01:43:09,974
for businesses?

1290
01:43:10,474 --> 01:43:13,417
Anyone we've spoken to in the square, any of the businesses in the square.

1291
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,457
That's all I was told yesterday, Chief.

1292
01:43:14,638 --> 01:43:17,560
The business parking is along that wall, that back wall.

1293
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:24,526
Everything in the middle and anything that's parallel to the Colleen's down to Gaffey's is not business parking.

1294
01:43:24,766 --> 01:43:25,367
Business permit.

1295
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:27,409
They'll be held to the time limits that are posted.

1296
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:30,752
Additional point of further clarification.

1297
01:43:30,772 --> 01:43:32,753
You have three different time limits in that parking lot.

1298
01:43:32,793 --> 01:43:33,994
How come there's no kiosks in there?

1299
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:37,632
You have a kind of limit against the wall on the back of Salvatore's.

1300
01:43:37,852 --> 01:43:40,074
Then you have one for the business people on that wall.

1301
01:43:40,254 --> 01:43:41,655
And in the middle, you have two hour parking.

1302
01:43:41,895 --> 01:43:44,657
You have one hour, you have two hour, and the back of the wall parking.

1303
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:47,159
There's three different parking types in that parking lot.

1304
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:49,641
Well, what's your question?

1305
01:43:50,662 --> 01:43:52,323
Why isn't there just something that's consistent?

1306
01:43:53,389 --> 01:43:54,630
The clarification, what is it?

1307
01:43:54,810 --> 01:44:01,174
How can you have one hour, somebody, because they parked their car parallel, somebody parking it horizontal?

1308
01:44:01,194 --> 01:44:01,614
What difference?

1309
01:44:01,754 --> 01:44:08,018
Because we're trying to accommodate, we've been trying to accommodate the businesses in Medford before this parking plan was even in place.

1310
01:44:08,398 --> 01:44:09,739
Those signs aren't anything new.

1311
01:44:09,779 --> 01:44:11,100
Those are the signs that were there.

1312
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:17,032
And we wanted to have people be able to go into Colleen's, or go into the sub shop.

1313
01:44:17,112 --> 01:44:18,933
You've made your point, Councilor Pinter.

1314
01:44:19,013 --> 01:44:21,474
No, there's a corollary point to that.

1315
01:44:21,494 --> 01:44:22,934
There's a corollary point to that.

1316
01:44:23,154 --> 01:44:24,255
You go up Governor's Avenue.

1317
01:44:24,455 --> 01:44:27,076
How come if you go up Governor's Avenue, you've done nothing with that?

1318
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:30,457
It's two hours on the right going up, and one hour coming back on the left.

1319
01:44:30,477 --> 01:44:32,598
You have a chance to have the floor, Councilor.

1320
01:44:33,018 --> 01:44:33,938
Councilor Caviello?

1321
01:44:34,258 --> 01:44:35,179
Thank you, Mr. President, again.

1322
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:38,220
Back to the municipal lots.

1323
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,861
Okay, so Meffitt Square is just going to be the same as

1324
01:44:41,452 --> 01:44:43,933
The back lot, the back row, is this going to be the way it's been?

1325
01:44:45,114 --> 01:44:45,414
Correct?

1326
01:44:45,954 --> 01:44:49,776
As it was posted in the past, it's remaining the same.

1327
01:44:50,516 --> 01:44:58,780
Now, as I look out here in the back lot here, I only see one kiosk way up here on the side of the building for that whole lot.

1328
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,161
Shouldn't it be more than one kiosk?

1329
01:45:00,201 --> 01:45:03,662
I believe there is a second one, and I think they're just repositioning where the second one is.

1330
01:45:03,682 --> 01:45:04,122
Repositioning.

1331
01:45:04,243 --> 01:45:07,304
Now, what about, are you putting one in the Yale Street lot?

1332
01:45:08,371 --> 01:45:09,612
Yes, that one is due.

1333
01:45:10,053 --> 01:45:13,176
They, because of the weather today, they weren't able to do the pad.

1334
01:45:13,236 --> 01:45:16,720
They have to pour a cement pad because it's an asphalt surface.

1335
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,041
So they have to do concrete.

1336
01:45:18,322 --> 01:45:26,310
No, I'm receiving calls from other people about, uh, some people in the Haines square area park in that lot in the back at night.

1337
01:45:27,211 --> 01:45:29,173
Are they going to have to have their car out there in the morning?

1338
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:32,391
by a certain time in the morning for people to park there, right?

1339
01:45:32,511 --> 01:45:33,051
Yeah, I mean.

1340
01:45:33,071 --> 01:45:34,872
Yeah, the parking's limited over in that area, as it is.

1341
01:45:35,132 --> 01:45:38,913
The neighborhood, they would have to have the car out to accommodate the business people.

1342
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:45,375
I mean, the benefit is that they have an opportunity to park off street overnight.

1343
01:45:45,815 --> 01:45:48,336
And then in the morning, the car has to be removed.

1344
01:45:49,237 --> 01:45:49,317
OK.

1345
01:45:49,357 --> 01:45:50,137
And my last question.

1346
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:55,999
The resident permit parking, these gentlemen are going to be enforcing that also?

1347
01:45:56,499 --> 01:45:56,979
Yes, they are.

1348
01:45:57,259 --> 01:45:59,000
But the police will also be doing that.

1349
01:45:59,550 --> 01:46:01,171
For the most part, during the daylight hours.

1350
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:02,871
No, what about at nighttime?

1351
01:46:02,891 --> 01:46:03,912
Public parking will be doing it.

1352
01:46:03,932 --> 01:46:13,896
And they're also been informed that they're willing to stagger the shifts of their personnel so that you'll have some evening coverage and possibly even into the early morning hours.

1353
01:46:14,956 --> 01:46:21,899
They will stagger the shift, but they, they are willing to do that to make sure that we get citywide enforcement.

1354
01:46:22,839 --> 01:46:23,040
Okay.

1355
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:29,082
Chief, you know, if at your convenience, when you get the ruling on the handicap issue, um,

1356
01:46:29,449 --> 01:46:36,554
That is a key, because again, a lot of people are questioning that on who can park, who can't park.

1357
01:46:36,674 --> 01:46:40,236
As I stated, I don't want to contradict Mr. Skelton.

1358
01:46:41,057 --> 01:46:52,945
The last I heard was that a person who has the proper HP placard or plate could park in any space and are not held to the time limit.

1359
01:46:53,866 --> 01:46:56,287
I have to verify that to be accurate.

1360
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:02,862
I think that's one of the biggest issues that need to be clarified.

1361
01:47:03,943 --> 01:47:09,405
A lot of people are under the impression that they get a placket, I'm there for the day, and you can't.

1362
01:47:09,645 --> 01:47:10,926
I will get that answer tomorrow.

1363
01:47:13,067 --> 01:47:13,687
That's it for the moment.

1364
01:47:13,767 --> 01:47:15,008
I'm sure we'll have some more for you.

1365
01:47:15,605 --> 01:47:25,847
Thank you, and before we turn the floor over to Councilor Langel-Kern, if you'll indulge me, two quick questions from the chair which have been brought to my attention regarding these regulations.

1366
01:47:26,527 --> 01:47:28,408
Stacy's going to the hairdresser.

1367
01:47:29,128 --> 01:47:43,571
She fills up the meter for two hours parking, halfway in between getting her hair set and dyed and whatever else she's doing, two hours run out, she's there in the chair under the hairdresser dryer with the apron on, what is she gonna do?

1368
01:47:44,498 --> 01:47:45,178
Is she going to pay?

1369
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:47,359
Is she going to feed her meter?

1370
01:47:47,939 --> 01:47:49,220
What happens to Stacey?

1371
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:51,781
I will address that issue.

1372
01:47:51,861 --> 01:48:06,046
But as an overview, part of Republic Parking's job here for the city and what we promised them is that we will work to accommodate as many scenarios as we can to facilitate good business practices and turnover spaces in the city.

1373
01:48:06,766 --> 01:48:08,167
And we are already seeing that.

1374
01:48:08,287 --> 01:48:14,029
We've seen streets empty out from employees when we park our enforcement vehicle there just to go in and have lunch.

1375
01:48:14,685 --> 01:48:17,027
So we are seeing the preliminary effects of the program.

1376
01:48:17,707 --> 01:48:23,752
And we are dealing with specific issues such as the hairdresser scenario that has been brought to the administration's attention.

1377
01:48:24,352 --> 01:48:30,357
We are working on a validation program that will allow them to exceed the two-hour time limit without being cited.

1378
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:31,619
Thank you.

1379
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:44,808
Uh, in one more, even though I was just, uh, pointed out to me by one of my colleagues that I'm speaking from the chair, which I ought not do, uh, you pay a dollar 75 to park in South Medford.

1380
01:48:45,169 --> 01:48:46,870
You stay there for 45 minutes.

1381
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:48,471
You got a half hour left.

1382
01:48:49,152 --> 01:48:55,756
Can you go to Medford square and run to the bank on the same, same dollar 75 or do you have to repay at the next kiosk?

1383
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:58,298
No, you're actually paying for your plate.

1384
01:48:59,069 --> 01:49:05,274
And so your plate is in the system for the amount of time you purchase, and it will not be cited if you park on the street anywhere in the city.

1385
01:49:05,614 --> 01:49:06,394
Thank you very much.

1386
01:49:07,355 --> 01:49:09,877
Uh, councilor Lungo Kern has the chair, uh, floor.

1387
01:49:10,578 --> 01:49:12,119
Thank you, president.

1388
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:13,560
Um, Delaware.

1389
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:23,387
So on that last point with regards to if somebody is in the hairdresser salon, isn't it true that some spots are a maximum limit?

1390
01:49:23,703 --> 01:49:31,026
where you can only have the two hours, but then there's other spots that you could, you could refeed the meter, whether that's through your cell phone or by adding more money into the meter.

1391
01:49:32,046 --> 01:49:36,328
The payment of the meter is irrelevant of the time limit.

1392
01:49:36,708 --> 01:49:38,609
The time limit is what it is.

1393
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:43,471
So when you go to a kiosk, you can only pay for a maximum of two hours.

1394
01:49:44,131 --> 01:49:52,415
And if you were to not move your vehicle, but add additional monies to the meter, you would still be in violation of the two hour time limit ordinance.

1395
01:49:53,353 --> 01:50:05,343
So that prevents what they call meter feeding and defeats the purpose of the program to facilitate turnover of spaces to free up time, move the employees out, and allow more customers to come in.

1396
01:50:07,585 --> 01:50:12,148
I believe that we were told incorrect information then at committee of the whole meetings.

1397
01:50:12,328 --> 01:50:17,052
We were told that certain spots would not be limited and you could add more money.

1398
01:50:17,953 --> 01:50:18,854
We were definitely told that.

1399
01:50:19,134 --> 01:50:20,835
We've asked that more than once.

1400
01:50:20,875 --> 01:50:22,697
So maybe we can get a clarification on that.

1401
01:50:23,238 --> 01:50:37,690
Chief, I don't think Chief Sacco was at, I think we had three city council committee of the whole meetings when we were told some meters could be refed if somebody was in a restaurant and they were exceeding the two hours, it could be refed through your cell phone.

1402
01:50:39,011 --> 01:50:42,974
There were some that were gonna be the max, but then there were others that, am I recalling that correct?

1403
01:50:42,994 --> 01:50:48,058
I think if you were to put an hour, you would be defeated.

1404
01:50:48,078 --> 01:50:48,819
Oh, for two hours?

1405
01:50:48,859 --> 01:50:50,200
Up to the two hours, but that's my understanding.

1406
01:50:51,535 --> 01:51:02,042
My other question, so Chief, for the senior center, when will we know how many spaces will be free and where those will be placed?

1407
01:51:02,263 --> 01:51:06,286
When is the goal timeframe for that scenario?

1408
01:51:06,346 --> 01:51:14,892
I'm hoping by the end of the week we'll have the concrete answers and we'll just have to look and identify where the best spaces are to accommodate the center.

1409
01:51:15,372 --> 01:51:17,894
And those spaces will be clearly marked?

1410
01:51:18,555 --> 01:51:18,695
Yes.

1411
01:51:19,518 --> 01:51:27,441
And then one other question you had mentioned, and I got an email on it today, with regards to people dropping off their children at St.

1412
01:51:27,461 --> 01:51:28,522
Joseph's School.

1413
01:51:29,522 --> 01:51:31,123
I don't know if this is going to be an issue at St.

1414
01:51:31,163 --> 01:51:31,343
Ray's.

1415
01:51:31,383 --> 01:51:33,404
I'm not sure how much parking is at each school.

1416
01:51:33,764 --> 01:51:35,064
But specifically, St.

1417
01:51:35,104 --> 01:51:38,846
Joe's parent wants to run in, drop off their child, and run back out.

1418
01:51:39,266 --> 01:51:42,067
How do they know they don't have to feed the meter at that point?

1419
01:51:42,422 --> 01:51:52,690
I think in all of those examples, a school drop-off, a daycare drop-off, a school pick-up and a daycare pick-up, we know people aren't hanging around for long periods.

1420
01:51:53,871 --> 01:51:55,872
There'll be consideration given during those times.

1421
01:51:56,213 --> 01:51:58,755
How will Republic know where the daycare is a place?

1422
01:51:59,135 --> 01:52:00,336
Which schools need this?

1423
01:52:01,217 --> 01:52:06,881
I think we've already kind of identified those locations, and I'm open to hearing more.

1424
01:52:06,901 --> 01:52:09,363
It may pop up along the way, but I've already, you know,

1425
01:52:10,071 --> 01:52:14,675
pretty much heard the list of all of the concerns for those types of, uh, operations.

1426
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:16,116
Okay.

1427
01:52:16,276 --> 01:52:16,597
Thank you.

1428
01:52:16,677 --> 01:52:17,938
Mr. President, just if I could.

1429
01:52:18,338 --> 01:52:18,899
Thank you.

1430
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:21,101
Uh, council longer current, you're finished.

1431
01:52:21,181 --> 01:52:22,962
A council night was next council.

1432
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:26,065
Max, do you have a, uh, point?

1433
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:28,807
And we also have many citizens who have yet to address us.

1434
01:52:29,068 --> 01:52:30,589
And I think you're eager to speak.

1435
01:52:30,629 --> 01:52:32,751
You echo my sentiment, uh, Mr. President.

1436
01:52:33,091 --> 01:52:37,055
Um, I think we have a number of people here that are lining up in queue that have questions that they want answered.

1437
01:52:37,195 --> 01:52:37,295
Um,

1438
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:42,570
some of which are business owners that probably have to get up very early tomorrow morning to be sure that operations are up and running.

1439
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:54,416
With that being said, you made a suggestion at the beginning of the meeting that we might want to reserve our questions for the end, allow the folks from Republic and the Traffic Commission to get an understanding of what the questions are that are coming to them so they can answer those questions.

1440
01:52:55,037 --> 01:53:04,181
I think we're in a position to have the good fortune of being able to reach out to these folks and get return calls and speak with them much more frequently and much more easily than the people that are here in the audience.

1441
01:53:04,221 --> 01:53:07,143
And they've been waiting patiently, Mr. President, so I'd ask that maybe we can

1442
01:53:08,043 --> 01:53:14,344
Mr. President, just if I could ask one question, because it's online that was just mentioned by Mr. Skelton.

1443
01:53:14,964 --> 01:53:21,705
And I realize these people have been waiting, but while Mr. Skelton is here, it's an important question.

1444
01:53:21,845 --> 01:53:23,686
And I would agree the people should speak.

1445
01:53:25,746 --> 01:53:27,826
You just mentioned about a validation program.

1446
01:53:28,987 --> 01:53:32,247
That's a brand new aspect to this program I've never heard of before.

1447
01:53:33,127 --> 01:53:37,288
And the way it was explained to me is what was just mentioned by the Council President.

1448
01:53:37,635 --> 01:53:47,379
You're going to allow business owners to reach out to Republic and say, these five plate numbers on Tuesday are going to be here for an extended period of time.

1449
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:49,300
Don't tag them.

1450
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:51,461
They're going to have to pay.

1451
01:53:51,681 --> 01:53:52,261
Someone's going to pay.

1452
01:53:52,281 --> 01:53:55,462
The business is going to pay, whatever it is, for that period of time.

1453
01:53:55,743 --> 01:53:56,463
But don't tag them.

1454
01:53:57,083 --> 01:54:02,966
So if you have any business that reaches out to you under this current program, I own a convenience store.

1455
01:54:03,286 --> 01:54:06,227
And I tell you, there are going to be these three plates parked

1456
01:54:06,849 --> 01:54:09,831
extended period of time near my business.

1457
01:54:11,411 --> 01:54:18,715
You're going to allow them to stay three, four, five, six, seven hours in that spot without getting a ticket.

1458
01:54:18,735 --> 01:54:24,218
They're going to pay, but as long as they get the validation, is that, is that how this program works?

1459
01:54:25,519 --> 01:54:29,221
We are charged with enforcing the ordinance and the rules of the city.

1460
01:54:29,961 --> 01:54:33,623
So whatever the city adopts as the rules for parking is what we will enforce.

1461
01:54:34,369 --> 01:54:42,656
The ability to offer the validations for extending the two hour time limit, which is currently the ordinance, is there through a validation program.

1462
01:54:43,296 --> 01:54:44,697
And there's a number of ways to do that.

1463
01:54:45,017 --> 01:54:55,966
One can be through an online reservation system, or it can be as simply if it's someone that only validates once a month or very infrequently, they can simply call our office and make an arrangement.

1464
01:54:56,779 --> 01:55:01,383
That's the discussion at this point as to who it applies to and how it applies.

1465
01:55:01,924 --> 01:55:04,406
That's up to the, uh, the city to decide.

1466
01:55:04,526 --> 01:55:06,068
So that hasn't been worked out yet.

1467
01:55:06,188 --> 01:55:07,229
Not all the details, sir.

1468
01:55:07,289 --> 01:55:07,409
No.

1469
01:55:07,829 --> 01:55:13,114
So we're moving forward in a couple of weeks and it seems like a lot of details haven't been worked out yet.

1470
01:55:14,015 --> 01:55:22,783
My concern with that is that if, you know, it might be good for one or two people in the course of a day, but if you have 45 people reserving spots on our streets,

1471
01:55:23,417 --> 01:55:29,440
As you just mentioned, the refeeding of a meter defeats the purpose of the whole program of moving cars along.

1472
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:33,122
And I can sympathize if someone needs to be in a business for over two hours.

1473
01:55:33,583 --> 01:55:36,124
However, I'm not sure how you're going to manage that.

1474
01:55:36,784 --> 01:55:46,910
And to have this program, the validation program, just brought up at the last minute, I don't think is a good program, especially where there's no consistency.

1475
01:55:47,210 --> 01:55:49,451
There's no policy from what you're telling me.

1476
01:55:50,151 --> 01:55:51,992
I doubt the city has a policy on that.

1477
01:55:53,417 --> 01:55:56,939
And I'm not sure if that's something that should be implemented right away.

1478
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:05,725
And I know the mayor is trying to appease anyone that makes a phone call to him, but I'm not quite sure that's in the best interest of our city as a whole.

1479
01:56:06,285 --> 01:56:14,350
And it may not be a question to you, but I'm very concerned about that program because potentially anyone can give you seven plates.

1480
01:56:15,331 --> 01:56:20,274
Any business owner can call and give you seven plate numbers and say, please don't touch these Tuesday.

1481
01:56:21,123 --> 01:56:23,425
I mean, I don't see what would prevent that.

1482
01:56:23,886 --> 01:56:26,188
And before you know it, there's going to be no on-street parking.

1483
01:56:27,349 --> 01:56:28,310
Everything's going to be saved.

1484
01:56:29,451 --> 01:56:31,273
Really, when you boil down to it.

1485
01:56:31,573 --> 01:56:36,478
And it would be worthwhile to pay $0.25 for every 15 minutes.

1486
01:56:37,059 --> 01:56:37,900
It'd be a bargain.

1487
01:56:38,781 --> 01:56:40,042
Actually, you may even get people that

1488
01:56:40,493 --> 01:56:46,255
park there all day, and take the bus into town for $4 or $5, whatever it costs.

1489
01:56:46,575 --> 01:56:47,295
I mean, really.

1490
01:56:47,315 --> 01:56:53,617
And I might be stating it very simply, but there's a huge concern with that.

1491
01:56:54,037 --> 01:57:00,740
And I think that was a knee-jerk reaction by this administration to try to help out a few people, all in good faith.

1492
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,260
But I don't know how that's going to work.

1493
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,041
And I would recommend that that doesn't move forward.

1494
01:57:07,418 --> 01:57:08,859
If I may, my name is Dan Nash.

1495
01:57:08,879 --> 01:57:10,640
I'm the regional manager for Republic Parking.

1496
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:14,742
When we discussed this validation program, it was to allow an additional hour.

1497
01:57:15,302 --> 01:57:19,744
So it would only be up, they could purchase up to a third hour, not unlimited for the entire day.

1498
01:57:20,624 --> 01:57:24,286
And that's the city, that's the city policy now.

1499
01:57:24,686 --> 01:57:31,410
It's not the city policy now, but that's, what's been discussed with the administration to try to accommodate, you know, the example that was provided by the president earlier.

1500
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:36,052
And so was raising the fee to $400 discussed and that was raised.

1501
01:57:37,177 --> 01:57:40,961
I mean, there's a lot of discussion going on and no one knows what's happening.

1502
01:57:41,821 --> 01:57:42,642
And that's the problem.

1503
01:57:43,022 --> 01:57:43,463
It really is.

1504
01:57:43,503 --> 01:57:46,626
And I'm not blaming you too, but there's a lot going on.

1505
01:57:46,666 --> 01:57:50,349
And these are the reasons why we should have had 10 public hearings prior to this.

1506
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:53,412
And from what we see, you're right.

1507
01:57:53,452 --> 01:57:59,317
There's always going to be work in progress, but this is only about 40% in completion, in my opinion, chief, at this point.

1508
01:58:00,121 --> 01:58:04,823
And I don't know how we have a go-live date, which doesn't make any sense.

1509
01:58:05,203 --> 01:58:06,584
All I can ask is for your patience.

1510
01:58:06,964 --> 01:58:11,766
I think a lot of the bugs have already been worked out, but every day we're going to find something new that we're going to have to work on.

1511
01:58:11,786 --> 01:58:13,506
It's the residents' patience, not my patience.

1512
01:58:15,287 --> 01:58:22,390
Part of the problem that we have when we first started talking about that validation program was a lot of the postings in the city on the main drags

1513
01:58:23,498 --> 01:58:24,518
were one hour only.

1514
01:58:25,338 --> 01:58:31,199
All of those one hours were increased to two to accommodate some of the businesses, the hairdressers and things of that nature.

1515
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:51,763
And then I think it was already addressed on maybe going up to a third hour for those accommodations, but no way would someone be able to be there or make arrangements with anyone that they could be in that spot all day, unless they were parking in a spot that has all day parking, where you could pay $5 and park there for the day.

1516
01:58:53,839 --> 01:58:56,680
That would be the only exception, because it has to be consistent.

1517
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:57,120
Where is that policy?

1518
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,140
Where is that written, Chief?

1519
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,020
Where is that written?

1520
01:59:01,681 --> 01:59:04,121
It must be a policy, a guideline.

1521
01:59:04,361 --> 01:59:07,562
Where is that written, the validation policy?

1522
01:59:09,382 --> 01:59:10,623
I don't have that.

1523
01:59:10,663 --> 01:59:11,203
That's what I mean.

1524
01:59:11,443 --> 01:59:12,323
Where is this stuff?

1525
01:59:12,383 --> 01:59:17,004
As far as the validation, I think that's between the merchant and the customer.

1526
01:59:17,024 --> 01:59:21,765
No, but Chief, God forbid something happens to you tomorrow, who's going to have this information in their head?

1527
01:59:23,268 --> 01:59:25,388
I mean, the sign is what it says.

1528
01:59:25,428 --> 01:59:31,109
If it says two hour limit, I know, but business owners are walking around now telling people that they can get validation.

1529
01:59:31,409 --> 01:59:33,610
And it wasn't an hour that I heard from business owners.

1530
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:36,190
So they thought they can get more than an hour, just so you know.

1531
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:41,591
And if we don't have anything in writing chief, why would anyone be requesting more than one hour?

1532
01:59:41,631 --> 01:59:46,272
If you already have a two hour limit and now you're going to be granted maybe a validation for the third hour.

1533
01:59:46,812 --> 01:59:50,793
Why would any business want to grant someone a validation for longer than that?

1534
01:59:50,833 --> 01:59:51,213
I mean, that's,

1535
01:59:52,645 --> 01:59:54,626
is counterproductive to trying to generate the business.

1536
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:57,227
What if they have an employee they want to park out there for a couple hours?

1537
01:59:58,047 --> 01:59:59,347
There's a lot of reasons, Chief.

1538
02:00:00,327 --> 02:00:01,348
There's a lot of reasons.

1539
02:00:01,908 --> 02:00:03,789
And we should be in the business of saving spots.

1540
02:00:03,809 --> 02:00:08,650
As we go along, we'll encounter all of these, and we'll correct the problems that exist.

1541
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:09,450
It's a new day.

1542
02:00:09,490 --> 02:00:10,250
That's all I can say.

1543
02:00:10,351 --> 02:00:11,211
It is a new day.

1544
02:00:11,831 --> 02:00:13,051
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1545
02:00:13,451 --> 02:00:18,093
A number of citizens would like to speak, and one is approaching who already has.

1546
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:21,971
Okay, so you know my name, Gwendolyn Blackburn.

1547
02:00:23,172 --> 02:00:46,029
What I really wanted to say, I hope that our citizens out there that are listening and watching understand that if they're talking about a committee here, it is not the committee and it's not the report that Councilor Marks, myself, and the other citizens worked on because I'm hearing things that really

1548
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:48,651
did not come out of our committee.

1549
02:00:49,552 --> 02:00:58,277
And so I'm hoping that people understand there was one committee back 2008, 2009, and we gave a report to the mayor.

1550
02:00:58,757 --> 02:01:00,798
We never heard another thing from the mayor.

1551
02:01:01,278 --> 02:01:01,899
That was it.

1552
02:01:02,379 --> 02:01:03,260
We were all done.

1553
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:08,603
And so I just hope that people understand that we did our job.

1554
02:01:09,283 --> 02:01:10,924
We went around to all these cities.

1555
02:01:11,364 --> 02:01:13,405
We got all the information that we could get.

1556
02:01:13,986 --> 02:01:14,846
We had our meetings.

1557
02:01:14,886 --> 02:01:15,967
We put it all together.

1558
02:01:16,307 --> 02:01:17,268
and we gave it to the mayor.

1559
02:01:17,908 --> 02:01:19,569
We never heard anything else from him.

1560
02:01:20,109 --> 02:01:27,553
From that point on, anything else that you're hearing and anything else that's coming up, that's the mayor.

1561
02:01:28,534 --> 02:01:29,374
And so I just

1562
02:01:29,925 --> 02:01:41,808
I just need you to know that it wasn't our committee, because we were very diligent about what we did, and we put a lot of time into going around to these different cities and towns.

1563
02:01:42,928 --> 02:01:47,069
I do have a question, though, having been standing here.

1564
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:52,651
I'm understanding that people have to know their license plate.

1565
02:01:53,652 --> 02:01:59,613
Because I can tell you, two people in my house, they have no idea what their license plate happens to be.

1566
02:01:59,833 --> 02:02:00,473
I know mine.

1567
02:02:01,153 --> 02:02:08,635
But there are a lot of people that they don't know.

1568
02:02:08,975 --> 02:02:10,315
And I don't understand.

1569
02:02:12,535 --> 02:02:17,796
The thing that has happened is that all of this has been put into play.

1570
02:02:19,056 --> 02:02:21,677
You get bits and pieces of information, like the lady said.

1571
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:26,387
People don't know they have to know their license plate.

1572
02:02:26,407 --> 02:02:28,952
I don't know how many people in here know their license plate.

1573
02:02:29,794 --> 02:02:32,479
They may, may not, but a lot of people don't.

1574
02:02:34,125 --> 02:02:37,228
The other question, and I'll sit down because this lady wants to speak.

1575
02:02:37,248 --> 02:02:37,929
She has to leave.

1576
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:40,631
But what are we doing?

1577
02:02:41,212 --> 02:02:49,959
And I would think that the first thing that might have happened is that we might have gotten meters up by Tufts up on Boston Avenue.

1578
02:02:50,019 --> 02:02:53,643
Those kids park up there all day, every day, free of charge.

1579
02:02:54,423 --> 02:03:00,204
And I would think, I was told they have to put concrete to put those kiosks there.

1580
02:03:00,845 --> 02:03:03,585
They charge at the garage $8 a day.

1581
02:03:03,705 --> 02:03:13,028
I'm told these, we've been missing a lot of money by not having any kind of meters or anything up there.

1582
02:03:13,128 --> 02:03:14,168
I love the kids, but.

1583
02:03:14,908 --> 02:03:15,749
That's all I want to say.

1584
02:03:15,829 --> 02:03:16,329
Everybody else.

1585
02:03:16,830 --> 02:03:17,150
Thank you.

1586
02:03:17,250 --> 02:03:18,931
Point of information.

1587
02:03:19,052 --> 02:03:19,272
Yes.

1588
02:03:19,352 --> 02:03:22,915
And Mrs B, thank you for, for your clarification or the report.

1589
02:03:23,395 --> 02:03:29,260
I was just referring that I said after you guys made the original initial recommendations at that point,

1590
02:03:29,695 --> 02:03:33,016
The only person that could do anything was the mayor, because he's the signatory authority.

1591
02:03:33,477 --> 02:03:34,577
It didn't sound like it.

1592
02:03:34,597 --> 02:03:36,978
I thought you were talking about our committee.

1593
02:03:37,038 --> 02:03:38,879
I wanted the trustees to know for sure.

1594
02:03:38,979 --> 02:03:40,440
It was not our committee.

1595
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:44,061
Well, the committee that you were on, though, did make recommendations for kiosks and meters.

1596
02:03:44,081 --> 02:03:45,542
So if you want the paper, I'll give it to you.

1597
02:03:46,142 --> 02:03:46,502
Thank you.

1598
02:03:46,862 --> 02:03:49,003
Ma'am, could you please state your name and address for the record?

1599
02:03:49,284 --> 02:03:54,746
My name is Patricia Davenport, and I live in 127 Monument Street, West Medford.

1600
02:03:55,388 --> 02:04:00,551
I love West Medford, the uniqueness of it, its small businesses and shops.

1601
02:04:00,571 --> 02:04:02,252
I'm just going to mention a few.

1602
02:04:02,312 --> 02:04:03,733
I'm in and out of them often.

1603
02:04:04,573 --> 02:04:16,920
CB Scoops, Paul Reviews, okay, Dynamic Computer, and I'm just trying to list a few that I use a lot, Magnificent Muffins, and all the restaurants, delis, there are many of them.

1604
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:25,144
I'm afraid this is really going to hurt these small businesses, and that would destroy the character

1605
02:04:25,493 --> 02:04:27,975
and the environment of West Medford, I think.

1606
02:04:28,335 --> 02:04:30,257
I'm talking about West Medford, that's where I live.

1607
02:04:31,117 --> 02:04:34,660
The second thing that I'm very concerned about is the process.

1608
02:04:35,841 --> 02:04:38,122
The process was not transparent.

1609
02:04:39,083 --> 02:04:50,231
There wasn't much or any input from residents or small businesses, which I believe is against the way we're supposed to be as a democracy.

1610
02:04:53,792 --> 02:05:02,097
serve along the lines of no taxation without representation, no kiosks without people being informed and discussing it.

1611
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:09,242
And the third thing is that the Republic Parking is not a local business.

1612
02:05:09,562 --> 02:05:11,503
It's not even a Massachusetts business.

1613
02:05:12,203 --> 02:05:15,085
It comes from, I believe, Chattanooga, Tennessee.

1614
02:05:15,686 --> 02:05:22,950
So we've outsourced this money-making operation to out-of-state

1615
02:05:23,452 --> 02:05:28,413
which makes any recourse incredibly difficult.

1616
02:05:28,593 --> 02:05:33,614
Anybody who's tried to deal with a big bank, you get put on hold for your entire day.

1617
02:05:35,175 --> 02:05:42,517
Talking about tweaking, I don't think that's going to happen very easily after this has been put into effect.

1618
02:05:44,237 --> 02:05:52,239
And I have heard too, now I don't want to say this for sure, but I have heard that there have been complaints about Republic Parking.

1619
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:59,485
Because what happens is when you put in your license plate, you don't get anything on your windshield.

1620
02:06:00,065 --> 02:06:02,367
It goes to your house, to your address.

1621
02:06:03,168 --> 02:06:09,453
And occasionally, by the time it's come to your address, you already have a late fee.

1622
02:06:10,754 --> 02:06:15,138
And trying to get in contact, not with City Hall, that's easy enough.

1623
02:06:15,622 --> 02:06:27,029
not with even Boston, but get in contact with a big company in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to explain that you didn't get this in time, to pay it in time, is a big problem.

1624
02:06:28,329 --> 02:06:38,415
And I'm really afraid this is going to create a huge disruption in West Medford, in terms of its culture and its climate.

1625
02:06:38,795 --> 02:06:39,936
I love the stores.

1626
02:06:39,976 --> 02:06:40,636
They're wonderful.

1627
02:06:41,037 --> 02:06:43,178
They won't exist if people have to pay them.

1628
02:06:43,498 --> 02:06:45,039
There are also things about how much

1629
02:06:45,478 --> 02:06:59,867
The businesses have to pay to have parking for the owners, for their employees, that on top of, I believe, I read it in your article, Penta, that that could break the backs of some of these businesses.

1630
02:07:00,888 --> 02:07:05,791
And then the last point I'd like to make is everyone, or people who are for it, say just get used to it.

1631
02:07:07,892 --> 02:07:13,216
We can and do get used to anything, but it's like frogs who are put into

1632
02:07:13,773 --> 02:07:18,214
a pot of water, cold water, and then you turn up the heat and finally they're cooked.

1633
02:07:19,594 --> 02:07:28,496
So I don't want to get used to that because the way it was done, the possible effects, there are many other things that could have been done.

1634
02:07:29,136 --> 02:07:36,838
Local people, maybe hiring another traffic officer or employing local people.

1635
02:07:36,958 --> 02:07:42,939
We do not need to outsource to Tennessee to get something done for our community.

1636
02:07:45,035 --> 02:07:51,260
Thank you.

1637
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:52,261
Thank you, Mr. President.

1638
02:07:52,301 --> 02:07:54,282
Bob Capucci is 71 Evans street.

1639
02:07:54,343 --> 02:07:55,504
I'll try to be very brief.

1640
02:07:56,304 --> 02:08:06,913
Uh, I, I hope that this kiosk issue is a watershed event that that'll speak to the larger issue of, of our city.

1641
02:08:07,093 --> 02:08:12,578
And I mean, look at all these citizens that are coming up here tonight that didn't even know this was coming.

1642
02:08:12,975 --> 02:08:15,596
All the problems it's gonna cause for these people.

1643
02:08:16,096 --> 02:08:25,139
Even some of the details that, with all due respect, the chief and the company that put these in aren't quite sure about yet, in terms of rules and whatnot.

1644
02:08:25,879 --> 02:08:27,460
We're a city of about 58,000.

1645
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:30,120
We have 38,000 registered voters.

1646
02:08:30,561 --> 02:08:36,182
In any municipal election cycle, maybe 9,000 people come out to vote.

1647
02:08:38,303 --> 02:08:41,064
I hope that this kiosk, and this is an election year,

1648
02:08:41,615 --> 02:08:51,943
I hope that this kiosk event is a watershed event and we have 20,000 people come out and vote this year because our city charter needs to be changed.

1649
02:08:52,443 --> 02:09:01,070
We need a city council that's going to be able to put forward a charter commission review.

1650
02:09:01,110 --> 02:09:02,311
It's been almost 30 years.

1651
02:09:04,853 --> 02:09:11,418
With all due respect, there are always four votes that always go the mayor's way on this city council.

1652
02:09:12,971 --> 02:09:22,177
And when the votes don't go their way, I don't mean to digress, but for instance, the million dollar, actually a $680,000 offer by Councillor Penta a few months ago,

1653
02:09:28,528 --> 02:09:40,456
on the water pipes, when that passes, even when we get a miracle of that fourth vote, to go against something, this mayor who has all power in this city, it's too much power in any one office, he vetoes it.

1654
02:09:41,097 --> 02:09:53,145
So even if this city council comes up with a resolution tonight of seven to nothing in the affirmative to help all these people and businesses that are confused about it, what's to stop the mayor from just saying, no, I'm doing it my way anyway?

1655
02:09:54,066 --> 02:09:57,588
Please, Medford City Council, you have the authority to review our city charter,

1656
02:09:57,955 --> 02:10:06,418
It's long overdue to be changed, or let's hope that this kiosk event is a watershed event, and the people that you represent.

1657
02:10:06,458 --> 02:10:10,019
When I come and address this council, I'm seeing my neighbors on Evans Street.

1658
02:10:10,099 --> 02:10:11,439
I'm seeing my neighbors up in the Heights.

1659
02:10:11,759 --> 02:10:13,240
I'm seeing local business owners.

1660
02:10:14,980 --> 02:10:24,763
It really needs to change, and we really need the voices that you folks need to be in a city that's dominated by the mayor's office.

1661
02:10:24,783 --> 02:10:25,484
Thank you very much.

1662
02:10:25,504 --> 02:10:26,604
Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

1663
02:10:31,266 --> 02:10:33,448
Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

1664
02:10:33,808 --> 02:10:36,590
Yes, Maria Baker, 22 Summit Road in Medford.

1665
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:42,914
I am the owner, director, operator of Play Academy Learning Center at 65 Riverside Ave in Medford.

1666
02:10:43,555 --> 02:10:52,161
And I want to say that I have had many concerns, and I have emailed all of you, so I imagine you are all familiar with what my concerns are.

1667
02:10:52,701 --> 02:10:59,526
And I am happy to say that most of my concerns are being dealt with, and I really feel positive about that.

1668
02:11:00,882 --> 02:11:04,484
A lot of my anxieties have been taken care of.

1669
02:11:04,504 --> 02:11:21,010
Along with that, it has taken a little bit of time, and I need to manage all the anxieties and concerns of my customers throughout these past couple days that the parking program appears to be live, even though we keep hearing it's mid-January.

1670
02:11:21,090 --> 02:11:24,832
So I'm dealing with that with the customers and trying to help them out.

1671
02:11:25,326 --> 02:11:31,552
I understand that the meters are taking money, and so, you know, I'm just a little bit confused about that.

1672
02:11:31,592 --> 02:11:49,489
There are a lot of things that I think there's confusion about, and I have some questions here that I'd like to just maybe list out, and I understand the representatives here are here to answer our questions, and so if it would be okay for me to just list them out, and then we could get some answers, if not today, then when they're ready, and have answers to these questions.

1673
02:11:51,185 --> 02:11:53,486
One thing maybe isn't for them, but more for the city.

1674
02:11:54,947 --> 02:12:12,194
On East Transit Way where I have two emergency exits there, and in the past when we shovel, because those are my emergency exits, what has happened is that the snow plows come along and they plow all of the snow right back up onto the sidewalk and block my emergency exits.

1675
02:12:12,694 --> 02:12:14,915
That is also where the kiosks are.

1676
02:12:15,015 --> 02:12:16,936
And so along the lines of the snow removal,

1677
02:12:18,192 --> 02:12:27,979
Will the city now that we have this money coming in from these parking meters and everything that's going on with this program, will we now be able to remove snow?

1678
02:12:28,279 --> 02:12:30,821
Not just push snow, but can we remove snow?

1679
02:12:31,262 --> 02:12:41,069
Because in order to have these parking spaces now be worth paying for, it would be really nice if we didn't have to somehow hurdle over these snow banks.

1680
02:12:41,129 --> 02:12:43,851
These snow banks are going to be in front of these kiosks.

1681
02:12:44,264 --> 02:12:57,609
We talked about, I've heard mention about the fact that it's going to be a shared responsibility and all of that, and that likely there won't be any citations if the kiosk isn't working.

1682
02:12:57,709 --> 02:13:06,213
But is there, how does the person issuing the citation know that the kiosk isn't working or isn't accessible or whatever the case is?

1683
02:13:06,793 --> 02:13:13,036
Is the resident then going to receive a citation and have to go through the trouble of defending themselves and that sort of trouble?

1684
02:13:13,076 --> 02:13:13,976
I just would love to know.

1685
02:13:14,329 --> 02:13:22,793
how exactly that works and how they know, how they're alerted that the kiosk is not accessible so that that would make things a little bit easier.

1686
02:13:23,194 --> 02:13:25,175
I know that there's lots of different information.

1687
02:13:25,215 --> 02:13:27,216
We talked a little bit about the two-hour parking.

1688
02:13:27,236 --> 02:13:28,916
There's a lot of confusion about that.

1689
02:13:29,337 --> 02:13:41,603
So if I park in one part of Medford Square for two hours and then later on in the day need to do another set of errands and I go to another part of Medford Square and want to pay for two hours, am I not allowed to do that?

1690
02:13:41,623 --> 02:13:42,884
A lot of people are confused.

1691
02:13:43,894 --> 02:13:48,117
they can only pay for 2 hours, period, for the entire day in Medford.

1692
02:13:48,457 --> 02:13:49,898
And I hope that that's not the case.

1693
02:13:50,298 --> 02:13:55,982
I would like to think that you can move your car and go someplace else in Medford, even just move your car to a different space.

1694
02:13:56,482 --> 02:13:59,524
But I know that there's a lot of question around that.

1695
02:13:59,544 --> 02:14:00,365
There's confusion.

1696
02:14:01,345 --> 02:14:05,948
Another question that I have is the technology when we put our credit cards and debit cards in.

1697
02:14:06,349 --> 02:14:11,672
I know that personally I've had my credit card identity and all the information stolen because

1698
02:14:12,042 --> 02:14:19,044
There are people out there who install cameras, and so when you insert your credit card and pull it out, everything is recorded and pulled.

1699
02:14:19,404 --> 02:14:22,845
So my question is, how secure are these kiosks?

1700
02:14:23,305 --> 02:14:34,528
Is there some sort of system in place where they're checked for these cameras that maybe are being installed, and whether or not there is even something to deter that from happening on these machines in the first place?

1701
02:14:35,858 --> 02:14:47,282
And then just right off of that point, if I want to go on my phone instead of going on to a kiosk to pay for my parking, I understand that there's a $0.35 per transaction fee.

1702
02:14:47,782 --> 02:14:52,464
So that's a little bit high if, in fact, I only need to go in for $0.15 or

1703
02:14:55,168 --> 02:15:17,462
And so here I am, $0.25, $0.50 into a meter cost, but now I need to tack on to that $0.35, which I think that in today's day and age, a lot of people probably would want to use that as a convenience, especially families with young children, maybe business owners who want to help out their customers who are elderly, who come to them and say, I don't understand this kiosk, can you help me?

1704
02:15:17,502 --> 02:15:20,184
And I could pull out my smartphone and say, here we go, I'll help you.

1705
02:15:20,706 --> 02:15:21,666
you know, muddle through it.

1706
02:15:21,886 --> 02:15:30,789
Well, now there's a $0.35 transaction fee for every time you do that, and that just seems high, and I hope that that is either reduced or goes away.

1707
02:15:30,809 --> 02:15:45,233
A couple more questions I have is, can these kiosks be programmed so that, for example, why, if it's not live right now, why is this machine taking money from people who are parking?

1708
02:15:45,515 --> 02:16:01,738
So can we program it so that when there are snowstorms and somebody goes over, because as a business owner or somebody, you know, I send someone down to shovel out my place, and now they see that they have parking that they need to pay for, will the machine not accept their money because it's snowing?

1709
02:16:01,798 --> 02:16:07,679
Will the machine not accept money during times that it is non-operational?

1710
02:16:07,999 --> 02:16:13,540
Whatever the reason is that, you know, there might be times that it's decided that they're not to take the money.

1711
02:16:14,434 --> 02:16:16,035
Is that programmed right in there?

1712
02:16:17,016 --> 02:16:30,706
And then my last question is, with this enforcement, is that if somebody blocks a handicap ramp or a hydrant, is that going to be enforced by the city, like the police, or is that going to be enforced by Republic?

1713
02:16:31,126 --> 02:16:40,773
Because I'm not sure who that would be, because that, you know, right in front of my business there is a hydrant there, and often that does get blocked, and often handicap ramps

1714
02:16:41,237 --> 02:16:54,122
are blocked and I'm really close to the senior center and it kills me to see that senior citizens struggle when they're trying to walk along and they're walkers or whatever and they can't because the handicap ramp is blocked.

1715
02:16:54,162 --> 02:16:56,843
And so it would be really nice to see that sort of enforcement too.

1716
02:16:57,383 --> 02:17:00,584
So those are my questions and hopefully we get some answers.

1717
02:17:00,644 --> 02:17:00,945
Thank you.

1718
02:17:07,652 --> 02:17:08,672
Conflict car of yellow.

1719
02:17:08,993 --> 02:17:12,174
If we maybe let the gentleman answer some of those concerns before someone else speaks.

1720
02:17:12,474 --> 02:17:16,256
If we could, um, it's as if you, uh, okay.

1721
02:17:16,496 --> 02:17:20,017
I thought I was going to just be a few minutes, but okay.

1722
02:17:20,398 --> 02:17:20,858
Thank you.

1723
02:17:20,898 --> 02:17:24,079
We've heard the, uh, gentlemen could address some of those pieces.

1724
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:29,222
I will try and remember them all, but I think I, do you need anything?

1725
02:17:29,282 --> 02:17:29,322
Uh,

1726
02:17:30,562 --> 02:17:39,946
First thing, Republic Parking has leased office space here in Medford, and we are a paying business here.

1727
02:17:40,446 --> 02:17:49,270
We are based out of Chattanooga, Tennessee, but we also have employed five Medford residents to be on our staff, and they're very familiar with the program here.

1728
02:17:50,291 --> 02:17:56,093
They've interacted with a number of the citizens that have already come to our office to purchase their residential permit or stop by with questions.

1729
02:17:58,449 --> 02:18:05,755
On the enforcement of, uh, any violation that's currently on the books will be enforced jointly by Republic Park and staff.

1730
02:18:06,896 --> 02:18:10,459
I'm sorry, as public parking staff as well as the police.

1731
02:18:10,999 --> 02:18:12,841
So we'll be working jointly on enforcement.

1732
02:18:13,501 --> 02:18:27,773
Uh, the kiosk, as far as credit card security have, the lady was referring to a skimming device and that is, that machine is designed to prevent any sort of skimming device from being attached to it.

1733
02:18:28,399 --> 02:18:33,343
All of the credit card information is transmitted completely by PCI compliance standards.

1734
02:18:34,023 --> 02:18:38,607
It's not stored anywhere, which is the primary rule of PCI compliance.

1735
02:18:39,327 --> 02:18:41,509
So the security is there for the citizenry.

1736
02:18:49,274 --> 02:18:52,537
There was a question about a citation being mailed to the residents.

1737
02:18:53,247 --> 02:18:54,149
That is not the case.

1738
02:18:54,810 --> 02:19:02,761
If there is a violation and a citation is issued, it will be placed on the vehicle as the first notice per Massachusetts statute.

1739
02:19:03,362 --> 02:19:05,925
So that is an inaccuracy out there.

1740
02:19:09,686 --> 02:19:09,926
Yes.

1741
02:19:10,166 --> 02:19:14,330
Uh, all of the kiosks are communicating to one central server, which is great.

1742
02:19:14,350 --> 02:19:19,915
It allows for real time information to be available to city police, all of our staff.

1743
02:19:20,435 --> 02:19:31,645
If there's a kiosk out of order, vandalized, uh, jammed out of a paper receipts, whatever it may be, we receive notification of that immediately so that we can address the issue.

1744
02:19:32,145 --> 02:19:36,529
And at that point, all of our officers will be aware that they are not to enforce that specific meter.

1745
02:19:37,192 --> 02:19:43,056
If we have a snow issue where they're inaccessible, that determination will be made before they go out on their beach to do the enforcement.

1746
02:19:43,677 --> 02:19:47,359
So that'll be easily communicated to the officers and should not be an issue.

1747
02:19:49,441 --> 02:19:54,264
The pay by sell is a convenience program and it's rolling out in cities across the country.

1748
02:19:54,745 --> 02:20:01,730
That service is actually provided by a third party company and the 35 cent transaction fee is pretty much universal.

1749
02:20:02,350 --> 02:20:04,612
That goes to cover their cost of technology

1750
02:20:05,090 --> 02:20:12,712
As part of that fee, they absorb the cost of the credit cards, the PCI compliance issues, and all the advertising that goes into the program.

1751
02:20:13,272 --> 02:20:20,034
The great thing about the pay-by-sale company that we've selected here is that they're the same company that's in place in Somerville.

1752
02:20:20,534 --> 02:20:24,756
So we already have a large number of users that can instantly roll into the program.

1753
02:20:25,196 --> 02:20:28,697
And if they choose to use the service, there is the convenience fee in place.

1754
02:20:29,117 --> 02:20:33,078
But that, as I said, is a third-party company that provides that technology for us.

1755
02:20:35,945 --> 02:20:38,648
Through the chair, thank you, President Del Russo.

1756
02:20:39,329 --> 02:20:45,917
Is that a one-time $0.35 fee, or every time you park, if you need 15 minutes, you have to pay $0.25 plus $0.35?

1757
02:20:46,238 --> 02:20:48,240
It's per transaction.

1758
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:51,845
So if you purchase $2, and again, it's optional.

1759
02:20:51,865 --> 02:20:55,169
You'll be able to use a credit card or pay coins at the meter.

1760
02:21:01,782 --> 02:21:07,005
So there could actually be an instance where we pay $0.50 to park our spot and $0.70 in fees.

1761
02:21:09,466 --> 02:21:16,029
If you put $0.25 on the meter and you have to pay by your phone $0.25 for 15 minutes, then they charge you $0.35 on the $0.25.

1762
02:21:16,070 --> 02:21:17,870
So it's over 100%.

1763
02:21:18,611 --> 02:21:20,772
If you choose to use the service for that transaction.

1764
02:21:21,112 --> 02:21:27,055
And then say we put another $0.25 in because we were going over our 15 minutes on our phone.

1765
02:21:27,135 --> 02:21:30,357
We added time to the meter, which is a capability, as I understand.

1766
02:21:30,657 --> 02:21:33,279
We'd be charged another 35 cents for adding another quarter run.

1767
02:21:33,819 --> 02:21:35,821
If you choose to do that, that would be the transaction.

1768
02:21:35,861 --> 02:21:40,464
So in essence, for a 50 cent, half an hour spot, I'd be paying a dollar 25.

1769
02:21:41,405 --> 02:21:45,247
Yes, but it is optional and it's, it's well defined to the users.

1770
02:21:45,288 --> 02:21:47,349
So there will be no hidden, hidden fees.

1771
02:21:47,869 --> 02:21:57,276
Um, I wouldn't be so sure to say that because today councilor Caviello and I went down to Bocelli's to have dinner and I went to the kiosk and I put my credit card information and everything like that.

1772
02:21:57,296 --> 02:21:59,738
And I wasn't, I was unable to pay through my, through my,

1773
02:22:00,508 --> 02:22:06,409
Park Medford application today and I put the money in, but when I read the terms and conditions, I didn't see that there would be an additional fee.

1774
02:22:06,429 --> 02:22:16,791
And then when I read the terms and conditions on the pipe and when I put my credit information in the pay by cell for Park Medford is not available as of yet, it'll be rolling out this month.

1775
02:22:17,571 --> 02:22:24,712
So that information, once you sign up for the program will be, you'll agree to that and you'll sign off on that when you register for the program.

1776
02:22:25,232 --> 02:22:26,032
I already did register.

1777
02:22:26,052 --> 02:22:27,333
I have a key.

1778
02:22:27,433 --> 02:22:29,573
I haven't, if I go to Somerville, I can use my,

1779
02:22:30,782 --> 02:22:31,482
device, right?

1780
02:22:32,122 --> 02:22:35,343
Because you guys are the same company and you have the same database and all that, right?

1781
02:22:35,583 --> 02:22:35,744
Yes.

1782
02:22:35,784 --> 02:22:39,885
So in Somerville, if you signed up for that, that information should be the same.

1783
02:22:39,925 --> 02:22:42,245
In Somerville, there's a $0.35 transaction fee as well.

1784
02:22:42,446 --> 02:22:43,386
No, I didn't sign up.

1785
02:22:43,426 --> 02:22:46,047
I signed up in Medford, but I'm saying it's not available in Medford.

1786
02:22:46,067 --> 02:22:50,308
But if I drove across the city to Somerville and I booked, would that same transaction fee apply?

1787
02:22:50,348 --> 02:22:51,168
And I guess the answer is yes?

1788
02:22:51,348 --> 02:22:51,588
Yes.

1789
02:22:51,708 --> 02:22:51,928
OK.

1790
02:22:53,009 --> 02:22:58,410
And is that part of the contract that the third-party vendor has put together between Republican and you?

1791
02:22:58,450 --> 02:23:00,591
Or is that part of this contract that's governing

1792
02:23:00,921 --> 02:23:02,903
the relationship between the city of Medford and Republic?

1793
02:23:03,183 --> 02:23:06,746
The contract between park mobile is with Republic Park.

1794
02:23:07,187 --> 02:23:13,252
And we presented that in our official proposal response to the RFP that was issued by the city to utilize that service.

1795
02:23:15,995 --> 02:23:18,057
Point of further clarification.

1796
02:23:18,277 --> 02:23:24,283
Are you saying that you already provided that to the city, but, and you're just rolling it out now?

1797
02:23:24,583 --> 02:23:25,604
Is that in the contract?

1798
02:23:27,053 --> 02:23:30,955
Yes, it's in the RFP response, which is a part of the contract that we signed.

1799
02:23:31,035 --> 02:23:33,277
I have all your responses, but that was never explained to us.

1800
02:23:33,337 --> 02:23:42,462
And another thing on the like venue, if I go online and I want to get a permit parking, a $10 permit parking, they're charging me $3 to go online to get a $10.

1801
02:23:42,542 --> 02:23:43,382
That's extortion.

1802
02:23:43,983 --> 02:23:44,703
30% on a $10?

1803
02:23:45,183 --> 02:23:46,884
On a $10?

1804
02:23:47,845 --> 02:23:50,627
When people before could come down to City Hall and get it for nothing?

1805
02:23:51,127 --> 02:23:54,329
They can still come to our office and pay no additional fees.

1806
02:23:54,949 --> 02:23:56,350
We're talking about going online.

1807
02:23:57,672 --> 02:23:59,133
to make it easier for the customer.

1808
02:23:59,153 --> 02:24:03,837
Councilor Knight just alluded to the fact you have to pay 35 cents to put a 25 cent time period in.

1809
02:24:04,098 --> 02:24:06,960
So you are charging 30% to buy a $10 to buy.

1810
02:24:07,361 --> 02:24:09,342
Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1811
02:24:09,803 --> 02:24:11,885
This is technology today.

1812
02:24:11,945 --> 02:24:18,591
The City of Medford actually charges a fee when you pay your tax bills online or a parking citation currently through the City of Medford.

1813
02:24:18,611 --> 02:24:19,952
So I just want to let Councilor Pinto know.

1814
02:24:19,972 --> 02:24:20,412
It's not a 30% charge.

1815
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:26,763
Councillor, it's a nominal fee, but 30 cents.

1816
02:24:26,843 --> 02:24:31,445
It's not, you know, listen, you guys are here only for one reason to make money.

1817
02:24:31,705 --> 02:24:32,646
That's the bottom line.

1818
02:24:32,686 --> 02:24:37,729
And we understand that, but I'm here to make sure that you don't make money and give the city back to the people.

1819
02:24:37,969 --> 02:24:40,270
So let them figure out what they need to do.

1820
02:24:41,911 --> 02:24:42,231
Thank you.

1821
02:24:42,251 --> 02:24:44,312
The points of information have been made.

1822
02:24:45,013 --> 02:24:51,056
And, uh, if we could resume, uh, unless you have any more, uh, questions to answer.

1823
02:24:51,942 --> 02:24:54,604
we'd like to resume conversation with the citizens again.

1824
02:24:54,764 --> 02:24:54,884
Sure.

1825
02:24:54,924 --> 02:24:57,025
There was one more question that we can answer at this time.

1826
02:24:57,325 --> 02:25:02,929
We can turn off the machines instantaneously if need be for a storm or emergency situation.

1827
02:25:03,029 --> 02:25:13,416
So if you pop was and leave that spot and go to another spot, can they go to another spot of that?

1828
02:25:13,496 --> 02:25:14,236
Is that it for the day?

1829
02:25:14,256 --> 02:25:15,177
You only can do two hours.

1830
02:25:15,757 --> 02:25:16,017
Yes.

1831
02:25:16,238 --> 02:25:17,538
It's in line with the current ordinance.

1832
02:25:17,578 --> 02:25:18,179
That's exactly.

1833
02:25:18,199 --> 02:25:20,060
You can move, you can move within the city.

1834
02:25:21,082 --> 02:25:25,045
You just cannot park in the same spot for two hours, more than two hours.

1835
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:44,018
The technology that we're using, the license plate recognition system, when it identifies a vehicle parked on a specific street, it has the latitude and longitude and photographs of the vehicle.

1836
02:25:44,905 --> 02:25:54,451
So when it comes back on that same street, it's able to compare a current photograph to a previous photograph, the license plates, and determine how long the vehicle has stayed.

1837
02:25:55,132 --> 02:25:57,213
That information is available to our officer.

1838
02:25:57,253 --> 02:25:58,454
What's the margin of error?

1839
02:25:59,835 --> 02:26:01,356
The margin of error is none.

1840
02:26:03,097 --> 02:26:10,982
Because the officer is able to view the pictures with the information to determine if a violation has occurred.

1841
02:26:11,588 --> 02:26:20,074
And they're going to determine if you're in that same spot, even though our spots currently aren't clearly marked, you're going to be able to tell if they're in that same exact spot.

1842
02:26:20,334 --> 02:26:20,534
Yes.

1843
02:26:20,574 --> 02:26:23,376
We're using latitude and longitude and photographic evidence.

1844
02:26:23,456 --> 02:26:26,058
So it's very easy to determine if a violation has occurred.

1845
02:26:27,018 --> 02:26:27,339
Thank you.

1846
02:26:27,699 --> 02:26:28,059
Thank you.

1847
02:26:28,119 --> 02:26:28,900
Counselor mocks.

1848
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,102
If we could receive resume, uh, Mrs. Consistio, is it?

1849
02:26:36,151 --> 02:26:40,515
My name is still Millie Casasio and I still live at 289 Elm Street.

1850
02:26:41,315 --> 02:26:46,000
When I said before about, you know, so many stories going around.

1851
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:48,382
And when I sat down, I felt a little better.

1852
02:26:48,962 --> 02:26:50,864
Now I am totally confused.

1853
02:26:52,345 --> 02:26:52,966
Totally.

1854
02:26:53,526 --> 02:27:01,593
And again, part of it, you know, this business about the senior center and they mentioned about setting up

1855
02:27:02,672 --> 02:27:04,232
a separate park for it.

1856
02:27:04,773 --> 02:27:13,655
All right, but now, how are you gonna know that everybody that's parked in that is a senior citizen?

1857
02:27:14,095 --> 02:27:27,958
Now, I know a friend of mine who lives in Gloucester, they can go to the town hall and they can get a sticker for their car, because anybody could come, you know, park their car and, oh, it's the senior center, what do I care?

1858
02:27:28,038 --> 02:27:28,979
I'm just gonna park.

1859
02:27:29,719 --> 02:27:30,799
How are you gonna tell that?

1860
02:27:32,807 --> 02:27:58,721
If, if I may, from the chair, it sounds to me like what the chief was saying that not every detail is worked out yet, but they've identified certain spots within the city, particularly at the senior center, which is due for major facelift, as you know, uh, in landscaping redesign that, um,

1861
02:27:59,613 --> 02:28:12,738
uh, the area adjacent will be, uh, assessed and, uh, a means is going to be figured out as to how to achieve that to registering your car with a sticker is, uh, one of those means.

1862
02:28:12,798 --> 02:28:20,681
I think that's something that they're, uh, examining as an option, but clearly, uh, something needs to be done there.

1863
02:28:21,182 --> 02:28:23,983
And I think the message has been made loud and clear.

1864
02:28:24,722 --> 02:28:33,851
Well, the main reason I brought it up again is because I didn't hear that, and I just thought, I'll suggest that.

1865
02:28:34,051 --> 02:28:35,733
I'll suggest that.

1866
02:28:36,254 --> 02:28:41,999
But, and again, the business then too, like some of these people, I don't do it.

1867
02:28:42,993 --> 02:28:43,273
I don't.

1868
02:28:43,393 --> 02:28:45,895
I'm never there more than two hours, okay?

1869
02:28:46,396 --> 02:28:55,543
But I know people, they go and they take the ceramics class and they take the knitting class and it's a social thing.

1870
02:28:55,623 --> 02:28:59,446
Some of those people, it's the only social thing they have.

1871
02:29:00,046 --> 02:29:05,230
So I had thought when I was up here a few minutes ago that

1872
02:29:05,650 --> 02:29:13,481
If they were there for three hours, it wouldn't be a problem, but it sounds like they would still have to move their car.

1873
02:29:13,902 --> 02:29:18,849
I think the chief was saying that's not the case, but what we have to be wary of

1874
02:29:19,773 --> 02:29:25,296
is Mr. Smith from Winchester going to find that out and park there so he can.

1875
02:29:25,336 --> 02:29:34,342
Well, that's, but that's why I said seniors, you need to, for seniors, if the seniors that you need to have some identification.

1876
02:29:34,402 --> 02:29:37,104
So people won't be doing that because people will do it.

1877
02:29:37,704 --> 02:29:38,484
They will do it.

1878
02:29:38,564 --> 02:29:39,185
Definitely.

1879
02:29:39,465 --> 02:29:39,805
Thank you.

1880
02:29:39,865 --> 02:29:41,686
And the chief is right behind you to respond.

1881
02:29:42,947 --> 02:29:44,468
Your neighbor just,

1882
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:47,761
Just some information on that.

1883
02:29:47,821 --> 02:29:55,464
We'll be working very closely with Pam Kelly, the director of the Council on Aging, and the person in charge of the senior center.

1884
02:29:56,865 --> 02:30:15,513
We'll be working something out, whether it's a placard that will have to be displayed on their dashboard, but it'll be something clearly identifiable so that, I think we're trying to stay away from issuance of decals that give people a time that they can park any day they want to park there and, you know, get on the bus and go to Mohegan or Foxwood or wherever.

1885
02:30:16,009 --> 02:30:17,790
This will be strictly for the center itself.

1886
02:30:18,671 --> 02:30:25,916
And some staff person from the center may have to go out and put the leaflets on the dashboards for the people.

1887
02:30:26,736 --> 02:30:27,076
Thank you.

1888
02:30:28,677 --> 02:30:29,438
Counselor, yes.

1889
02:30:29,498 --> 02:30:31,779
And we want to allow some of the citizens to speak.

1890
02:30:31,799 --> 02:30:32,760
I want to respond to the chief.

1891
02:30:35,202 --> 02:30:39,685
Chief, I believe there's approximately eight parking spaces in the front of the senior center.

1892
02:30:40,445 --> 02:30:44,348
And a lot of the times they will park across the street in the parking lot over there.

1893
02:30:45,122 --> 02:30:48,467
Now, I have two pictures here that were taken at nighttime.

1894
02:30:49,431 --> 02:30:53,534
You have two kiosks against the business wall of that parking lot.

1895
02:30:54,034 --> 02:31:01,119
And here's a picture of the parking lot for which somebody would have to walk from the sidewalk, where those businesses are, all the way to the ring road.

1896
02:31:01,459 --> 02:31:02,820
There's not one kiosk.

1897
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:05,221
How is anyone supposed to figure that out?

1898
02:31:05,321 --> 02:31:09,564
And especially at nighttime, when it's dark out, you can't even see these kiosks.

1899
02:31:09,804 --> 02:31:10,945
They don't have to pay overnight.

1900
02:31:10,965 --> 02:31:11,626
7 p.m., it's over.

1901
02:31:11,646 --> 02:31:12,246
What are you talking about?

1902
02:31:12,266 --> 02:31:14,047
At 4 o'clock at nighttime, it's dark out.

1903
02:31:14,427 --> 02:31:15,008
And you can't see.

1904
02:31:15,028 --> 02:31:15,908
How are you going to see these?

1905
02:31:16,229 --> 02:31:16,969
Against the wall.

1906
02:31:17,169 --> 02:31:18,190
And if somebody's coming in,

1907
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:28,233
And if they're a guest at the senior center and not knowing that they have to go to a kiosk, what are they going to walk, 150 feet to go put money in a kiosk?

1908
02:31:29,153 --> 02:31:36,575
There's also a kiosk on the sidewalk, on the backside, on the Clippership Drive side, right where the flashing lights for the crosswalk is.

1909
02:31:36,595 --> 02:31:38,916
But that's even further away than the parking lot is here.

1910
02:31:38,936 --> 02:31:41,917
But that's the main door of the center is on that side.

1911
02:31:43,917 --> 02:31:48,360
When seniors, when they have their Christmas thing and whatever it might be, they may get 100, 150 people.

1912
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:51,762
And sometimes it might go to two or three hours, whatever the event might be.

1913
02:31:52,102 --> 02:31:55,244
Why should they be worrying about having to come out and put money in a meter?

1914
02:31:55,264 --> 02:31:56,425
They do not have to worry about it.

1915
02:31:56,445 --> 02:31:58,366
As I said, we're going to be working with the director of the center.

1916
02:31:58,386 --> 02:31:59,947
But why wasn't this thought out ahead of time?

1917
02:31:59,987 --> 02:32:04,070
This is the whole issue of not having meetings ahead of time to discuss these matters.

1918
02:32:04,090 --> 02:32:09,353
No, I can just tell you, based on the nature of the phone calls that my office has been receiving, Alvin's been getting all those calls.

1919
02:32:10,526 --> 02:32:15,788
People who live in apartments above the stores in Medford Square want the city to decide where they're going to park.

1920
02:32:16,208 --> 02:32:16,948
You know, I'm sorry.

1921
02:32:17,568 --> 02:32:19,289
You're going to have to find your own space.

1922
02:32:19,729 --> 02:32:24,991
We'll make an accommodation for the senior center based on the population that attends there, and we'll work with the people.

1923
02:32:25,011 --> 02:32:27,211
But we cannot create parking spaces for people.

1924
02:32:27,571 --> 02:32:28,332
They will have to look.

1925
02:32:28,432 --> 02:32:30,892
We cannot satisfy every whim that comes up.

1926
02:32:31,213 --> 02:32:32,453
We could have had 1,000 meetings.

1927
02:32:32,473 --> 02:32:35,174
We could have met every single day for six months.

1928
02:32:36,084 --> 02:32:40,575
We still would not be touching every issue that comes up because there is always another issue.

1929
02:32:41,277 --> 02:32:45,908
But having always another issue is good to create the idea that had you had these meetings.

1930
02:32:46,368 --> 02:32:47,990
These issues would be minimal now.

1931
02:32:48,290 --> 02:32:49,131
These are major.

1932
02:32:49,371 --> 02:32:58,800
And what's happening is the small businessman, who's the lifeline of this community, is at risk because they're worried about their customers, whether they come back or not, whether they have appropriate parking.

1933
02:32:59,060 --> 02:33:03,844
And now, as Councilor Monk just alluded to, and I heard it earlier tonight, a special validation program.

1934
02:33:04,145 --> 02:33:04,905
So what are we going to do?

1935
02:33:05,126 --> 02:33:10,110
Take care of special people that contributed to the mayor's office and make sure that their tickets are taken care of?

1936
02:33:14,378 --> 02:33:15,418
Thank you, Councilor Pente.

1937
02:33:15,438 --> 02:33:16,379
You've made your point.

1938
02:33:17,599 --> 02:33:20,580
If we can, Chief, do you need to?

1939
02:33:22,261 --> 02:33:31,004
I'll let it pass, but just the one comment I want to make is that just reinforcing the point, every single day there's going to be another issue.

1940
02:33:31,444 --> 02:33:34,005
This thing has to get up and running and we'll have to tweak it.

1941
02:33:35,545 --> 02:33:40,407
I know there's been some talk about, you know, since 2009 there hasn't been much activity.

1942
02:33:40,632 --> 02:33:41,772
Well, there's been a lot of activity.

1943
02:33:41,792 --> 02:33:47,354
We've met with consultants, but we also, everyone on this rail knows, we've been through a very difficult time.

1944
02:33:48,014 --> 02:33:50,535
The whole nation's been through a difficult time economic wise.

1945
02:33:51,155 --> 02:33:52,475
We haven't been able to hire people.

1946
02:33:52,495 --> 02:33:56,176
We're just starting to hire people or replace vacancies.

1947
02:33:56,557 --> 02:33:59,397
I'd just like to finish, so I can finish my train of thought.

1948
02:33:59,477 --> 02:34:03,158
The idea is that there was always a more important issue.

1949
02:34:03,198 --> 02:34:08,760
Just like I said, with priorities for the police as far as enforcement, there's always a more important issue than parking enforcement.

1950
02:34:09,390 --> 02:34:15,252
There's been more important issues that confronted the city than having this parking management plan, but now it's time.

1951
02:34:16,452 --> 02:34:18,593
We've put it on the back burner for long enough.

1952
02:34:18,653 --> 02:34:19,893
Now it's time to move forward.

1953
02:34:21,034 --> 02:34:27,335
We're going to have some difficulties, but so far I've been very surprised at how quickly we've been able to resolve some of the issues that have popped up.

1954
02:34:28,296 --> 02:34:36,718
If I've heard for years, and I know it's true with the economic downturn, businesses were suffering and businesses weren't going to survive.

1955
02:34:37,118 --> 02:34:39,079
Well, if you couldn't survive with free parking,

1956
02:34:39,724 --> 02:34:43,245
I mean, now we're trying to generate some parking turnover.

1957
02:34:44,386 --> 02:34:48,948
So people will come to businesses in the square or all the squares, the business districts.

1958
02:34:49,288 --> 02:35:04,134
And as I said two weeks ago, yes, the contract call for certain amount of kiosks and certain amount of meters, some areas that did not receive them in this round, this program is built to expand if it proves successful.

1959
02:35:04,634 --> 02:35:07,655
So those other areas that people are concerned about that didn't get meted,

1960
02:35:08,695 --> 02:35:10,617
may very well see them in another year or two.

1961
02:35:11,197 --> 02:35:18,083
Chief, in all fairness, to this council especially, Hank Philippi Ryan came to this community and did an expose on its Channel 7.

1962
02:35:18,743 --> 02:35:24,708
And they talked to the mayor, and the mayor was asked a question about the non-enforcement up in the metro area.

1963
02:35:25,753 --> 02:35:27,716
for people parking there, and they did it for a month.

1964
02:35:27,776 --> 02:35:30,180
It wasn't a day, a month, the same people, no enforcement.

1965
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:33,605
And the mayor had the audacity to blame the city council for not giving the money.

1966
02:35:33,645 --> 02:35:35,087
That was absolutely not true.

1967
02:35:35,347 --> 02:35:40,535
This Memphis City Council has been most supportive of the police department and the fire department on every one of those issues.

1968
02:35:41,035 --> 02:35:48,219
So taking that and coming forward, you have a tax bill, you have a water bill, you have an excise, you have a meals tax, and you're having business people that are trying to survive.

1969
02:35:48,499 --> 02:35:59,144
You have a man that's never owned a business, doesn't know what it means to wake up in the morning, open the door, turn the key, gas, electric, employment, workman's comp, insurance, renter's insurance, trucks.

1970
02:36:00,645 --> 02:36:01,766
You put, you, you, you.

1971
02:36:04,787 --> 02:36:08,871
You put all that together, then you'll have an understanding.

1972
02:36:09,331 --> 02:36:12,854
You'll have an understanding what the small little business man has to go through.

1973
02:36:12,874 --> 02:36:14,635
Believe me.

1974
02:36:15,016 --> 02:36:17,818
I can't speak for the mayor, but I will in this one point.

1975
02:36:18,258 --> 02:36:22,242
He's the last person that wants to see anyone go out of business or an empty storefront.

1976
02:36:22,262 --> 02:36:23,302
He's doing a good job of it.

1977
02:36:23,342 --> 02:36:24,223
I'll tell you that.

1978
02:36:24,603 --> 02:36:25,784
That's one thing for sure.

1979
02:36:25,864 --> 02:36:30,508
No one wants to see an empty business or an empty storefront and someone suffer any more than they have to.

1980
02:36:30,528 --> 02:36:32,150
Do you remember a few years ago?

1981
02:36:32,450 --> 02:36:33,571
Thank you, Counselor Penta.

1982
02:36:34,347 --> 02:36:53,797
You know, on Riverside Avenue, when they shut down Riverside Avenue for the Ring Road, you put 39 businesses out because you took their front door visibility away, people that were here for years and years and years, and now what you're going to do is tell the small businessmen we're going to go to having a revenue enhancement rather than a traffic enforcement program.

1983
02:36:54,157 --> 02:36:56,278
Start it small, see where it takes you.

1984
02:36:56,778 --> 02:37:02,441
All I know is when they closed Riverside Avenue for that mall that they put in, that was the standard that was going on around the country.

1985
02:37:02,941 --> 02:37:04,463
Try to emulate the Meadow Glen Mall.

1986
02:37:04,703 --> 02:37:09,328
That is what hurt a lot of the businesses back in that day, back in the early 80s.

1987
02:37:09,448 --> 02:37:14,734
And now look, Meadow Glen Mall is not doing so well.

1988
02:37:14,754 --> 02:37:15,615
Thank you, Counselor.

1989
02:37:16,056 --> 02:37:17,277
Thank you, Chief.

1990
02:37:17,918 --> 02:37:22,363
Whoever was next in line, if you could, ma'am, state your name and address for the record.

1991
02:37:31,140 --> 02:37:36,204
My question is, I just want to find out the 50-minute parking we have over there.

1992
02:37:36,984 --> 02:37:42,648
They're going to stay the 50 minutes because the two gentlemen that were there yesterday and today, they made a pay.

1993
02:37:43,565 --> 02:37:44,946
for the court is other people.

1994
02:37:45,026 --> 02:37:46,927
They came in my store and any other store.

1995
02:37:47,887 --> 02:37:53,430
Just I'd like to know, are we going to leave it at 50 minutes, or they have to pay?

1996
02:37:53,791 --> 02:37:55,412
The chief will answer your question.

1997
02:37:56,832 --> 02:37:57,853
God bless the chief.

1998
02:37:59,814 --> 02:38:00,214
Thank you.

1999
02:38:00,294 --> 02:38:04,477
Yes, those spots are staying for 15 minutes, and they're free.

2000
02:38:05,077 --> 02:38:05,937
But they're 15 minutes.

2001
02:38:05,998 --> 02:38:06,998
OK, that's fine.

2002
02:38:07,038 --> 02:38:08,379
They're going to enforce that too?

2003
02:38:08,559 --> 02:38:08,799
Yes.

2004
02:38:09,539 --> 02:38:10,440
OK, thank you very much.

2005
02:38:10,926 --> 02:38:12,768
There's another question I want to ask.

2006
02:38:13,108 --> 02:38:14,449
I don't understand it too much.

2007
02:38:14,549 --> 02:38:27,399
Like Mr. Pender just say, if the business owner, the one that they got a restaurant or whatever, and they want to get that five spot for the whole night, they can do that or every two hours we have to move?

2008
02:38:27,519 --> 02:38:27,900
I don't know.

2009
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:30,201
I don't understand that question.

2010
02:38:30,222 --> 02:38:33,724
You just say two hours they have to move.

2011
02:38:33,964 --> 02:38:34,745
Okay.

2012
02:38:34,865 --> 02:38:35,225
Thank you.

2013
02:38:35,306 --> 02:38:36,326
That was my question.

2014
02:38:36,727 --> 02:38:37,587
Thank you very much.

2015
02:38:37,607 --> 02:38:38,188
Thank you.

2016
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:43,601
Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street.

2017
02:38:44,861 --> 02:38:50,603
In reference to a point you made about a fee, I paid by a debit card for my application.

2018
02:38:51,423 --> 02:38:52,783
A debit card is cash and cash.

2019
02:38:52,803 --> 02:38:55,544
There's usually no transaction fee associated with that.

2020
02:38:56,325 --> 02:39:02,026
I got my bank statement, and on my bank statement it said, from Republic Parking, citation fee.

2021
02:39:02,887 --> 02:39:06,308
Now why would an administration fee be called a citation fee?

2022
02:39:06,608 --> 02:39:07,648
Those are two different words.

2023
02:39:08,742 --> 02:39:15,543
Are we going to say that that administration fee is called the citation fee to say, this is the revenue we did in the first month.

2024
02:39:16,323 --> 02:39:18,984
How many, how many permit parking placards do we have?

2025
02:39:19,804 --> 02:39:20,784
We have a thousand in the city.

2026
02:39:20,804 --> 02:39:23,665
That's $3,000 is a citation fee.

2027
02:39:24,125 --> 02:39:31,526
The other thing is chief, what about resident permit parking enforcement after seven o'clock?

2028
02:39:31,626 --> 02:39:32,946
Who's going to be responsible for that?

2029
02:39:35,847 --> 02:39:36,427
And who do we call?

2030
02:39:37,845 --> 02:39:38,885
you call the Medford police.

2031
02:39:39,405 --> 02:39:52,948
We will be doing enforcement after hours, but I've been assured by the Republic folks that in the very beginning of this program, and I believe it will begin in January 26th, we will be putting out some messages ahead of time to the various permit parking streets.

2032
02:39:53,088 --> 02:40:03,850
So that the reminder notice to remind them to get going, to get their permits and that it will be going live on January 26th, I believe is the date.

2033
02:40:04,630 --> 02:40:05,270
Uh, but,

2034
02:40:06,350 --> 02:40:20,016
They will be staggering their personnel so that they can cover the evening and hopefully into maybe the early morning hours, because I know that many of the residents in the past, Yale Street, the Hillside, Tufts neighborhoods, they're very disappointed on the overnight.

2035
02:40:20,036 --> 02:40:30,960
When they get up in the morning and come out and see all the out-of-state plates or cars that are not registered to their street, they're gonna get up, they're gonna find a lot of orange tickets under the windshield wipers of those vehicles.

2036
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:35,822
But speaking with the mayor today and with others, I mean, we will be,

2037
02:40:36,661 --> 02:40:38,242
purchasing the technology as well.

2038
02:40:38,302 --> 02:40:44,507
So our crews will be able to go up and down the street to read the plates that will turn around and tell us whether they're registered for that street or not.

2039
02:40:44,547 --> 02:40:50,711
But the Medford police is still the police department in the city that will still be responsible for enforcement.

2040
02:40:51,151 --> 02:41:02,379
We are now sharing that responsibility with Republic parking and they're going to help us out tremendously because we still don't have enough personnel to handle every section of the city all the time.

2041
02:41:03,080 --> 02:41:04,060
Just another question.

2042
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:05,041
Point of clarification.

2043
02:41:05,101 --> 02:41:06,242
Counsel Lungo Kern.

2044
02:41:07,097 --> 02:41:08,818
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

2045
02:41:08,858 --> 02:41:17,063
Just while you're on that go-live date for the permit parking, is that scheduled to be the go-live date for the whole program, kiosks included?

2046
02:41:17,543 --> 02:41:20,665
Meters and kiosks would be January 15th, I believe.

2047
02:41:21,586 --> 02:41:23,067
Point of order on that question.

2048
02:41:25,288 --> 02:41:27,990
On that question today in South Medford, I got a phone call from a business person.

2049
02:41:28,330 --> 02:41:31,472
The people from Republic were there telling people that they had to put the money in the meter.

2050
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:34,421
So, I mean, what is it, the 5th, the 15th?

2051
02:41:35,482 --> 02:41:37,023
Why is Republic here?

2052
02:41:37,303 --> 02:41:39,604
Why are your people telling people to put the money in the meter?

2053
02:41:41,406 --> 02:41:43,387
The meters are active as of the 5th.

2054
02:41:44,287 --> 02:41:47,309
Enforcement on the meters will begin mid-month on the 15th.

2055
02:41:47,329 --> 02:41:48,330
So you're taking money in the meter.

2056
02:41:48,350 --> 02:41:49,090
That's what you're doing.

2057
02:41:49,491 --> 02:41:51,692
We're collecting money on behalf of the city.

2058
02:41:51,792 --> 02:41:54,934
Well, if it doesn't start till the 15th, what are you collecting it on the 5th for?

2059
02:41:55,014 --> 02:41:55,394
No, sir.

2060
02:41:55,714 --> 02:41:57,896
I said enforcement begins on the 15th.

2061
02:41:58,176 --> 02:41:58,776
What'd you say?

2062
02:41:59,136 --> 02:41:59,797
Enforcement.

2063
02:42:00,628 --> 02:42:02,950
The meters are active in collecting parking revenue for the city.

2064
02:42:02,970 --> 02:42:03,691
That's not fair.

2065
02:42:03,711 --> 02:42:04,591
What are you talking about?

2066
02:42:04,631 --> 02:42:06,253
You're taking people's money now.

2067
02:42:06,313 --> 02:42:09,295
So you're having 10 days of free money before you even do any enforcement.

2068
02:42:10,256 --> 02:42:11,357
To learn how to use the system.

2069
02:42:11,397 --> 02:42:13,699
Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

2070
02:42:14,460 --> 02:42:20,905
This city council asked the mayor's office specifically to have a grace period on violations and enforcement.

2071
02:42:20,925 --> 02:42:22,546
So I'm assuming this is the grace period.

2072
02:42:23,948 --> 02:42:25,329
This is a way to get it.

2073
02:42:25,369 --> 02:42:27,991
We asked for at least a couple of weeks.

2074
02:42:28,011 --> 02:42:28,691
We asked for a month.

2075
02:42:30,733 --> 02:42:32,814
Is this considered the grace period on enforcement?

2076
02:42:32,835 --> 02:42:33,195
Yes, sir.

2077
02:42:33,235 --> 02:42:38,158
And it's obviously another way to get more information out to the people and make them aware of it, which it obviously has.

2078
02:42:46,324 --> 02:42:46,704
Thank you.

2079
02:42:47,085 --> 02:42:48,085
Ma'am, you'd like to speak?

2080
02:42:49,666 --> 02:42:50,647
She's chilled.

2081
02:42:55,711 --> 02:42:57,132
My name is Nick Tomazook.

2082
02:42:57,172 --> 02:42:58,573
I live at 29 Garfield.

2083
02:42:59,724 --> 02:43:04,108
You know, we come here, and we squawk, and we hoot, and we howl.

2084
02:43:04,808 --> 02:43:06,349
This monster's here to stay.

2085
02:43:07,791 --> 02:43:11,594
The only ones that can change it is you guys can make it easier for the people in the city.

2086
02:43:11,734 --> 02:43:13,235
That's the mayor's office.

2087
02:43:13,255 --> 02:43:14,616
But this monster's here to stay.

2088
02:43:15,197 --> 02:43:15,377
Yeah.

2089
02:43:15,477 --> 02:43:16,377
That's for 10 years.

2090
02:43:17,098 --> 02:43:17,739
But it's not us.

2091
02:43:17,759 --> 02:43:18,039
We can't.

2092
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:24,304
So you guys got to start to listen to these citizens and try to make it as easy as we can.

2093
02:43:25,265 --> 02:43:29,188
So this company doesn't build another high rise down in Atlanta.

2094
02:43:30,116 --> 02:43:31,237
or wherever the hell they're from.

2095
02:43:31,797 --> 02:43:32,838
They're not from Massachusetts.

2096
02:43:32,878 --> 02:43:35,760
All right, that's all I got to say.

2097
02:43:35,860 --> 02:43:37,181
Thank you so much for your time.

2098
02:43:37,221 --> 02:43:37,681
Thank you.

2099
02:43:38,902 --> 02:43:40,003
Ma'am, you'd like to speak?

2100
02:43:40,943 --> 02:43:41,044
Hi.

2101
02:43:41,664 --> 02:43:46,567
My name is Janice Marino, and I own Backstreet Salon, 370 Main Street, South Medford.

2102
02:43:47,328 --> 02:43:55,774
And I have so much anxiety about this whole thing, because I have elderly clients that can't walk from one kiosk to another one to my shop.

2103
02:43:56,434 --> 02:43:59,156
And it's going to make a disaster for me.

2104
02:44:00,072 --> 02:44:00,933
And I'm sick about it.

2105
02:44:02,033 --> 02:44:02,794
So I don't know.

2106
02:44:02,894 --> 02:44:08,618
I just hope that everybody could just do something for the elderly people.

2107
02:44:08,878 --> 02:44:12,360
And I understand two hours is fine.

2108
02:44:12,420 --> 02:44:14,882
But sometimes in a hair salon, it gets really busy.

2109
02:44:15,582 --> 02:44:18,484
And it takes longer to do different services for people.

2110
02:44:18,745 --> 02:44:19,565
And they need more.

2111
02:44:19,985 --> 02:44:29,632
So what I was going to ask you is, if they have this kiosk, and they have to come out of the salon, and they have to move their car, they're not going to come anymore.

2112
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:31,270
They're not going to come.

2113
02:44:31,291 --> 02:44:33,292
They're going to say, I'm going someplace else.

2114
02:44:33,332 --> 02:44:36,674
I'm going to go to assembly mall and have free parking.

2115
02:44:36,755 --> 02:44:39,136
And why go to South Medford anymore?

2116
02:44:40,197 --> 02:44:43,019
You know, so I'm, I'm so scared about losing my business.

2117
02:44:44,300 --> 02:44:45,341
And that's all I have to say.

2118
02:44:45,701 --> 02:44:46,382
Thank you, Janice.

2119
02:44:50,705 --> 02:44:52,266
Sir, you name an address for the record.

2120
02:44:52,652 --> 02:44:56,895
My name is DJ Dabeningo, proprietor Dabs Lock 470 High Street, West Bedford.

2121
02:44:57,856 --> 02:45:06,963
Uh, I was here two weeks ago, uh, this evening, like tonight addressing the council on this parking issue that is now a going to be a big issue in this city.

2122
02:45:07,884 --> 02:45:13,028
Um, a couple of the concerns I addressed, um, and two weeks later still have no answers on one.

2123
02:45:13,048 --> 02:45:16,211
And I heard earlier from home, sorry for my lateness.

2124
02:45:16,291 --> 02:45:19,113
I, uh, suffered from a concussion earlier after falling on the ice and,

2125
02:45:19,705 --> 02:45:22,728
was resting at home, so I had to rush down here to speak on this issue.

2126
02:45:23,569 --> 02:45:27,213
One is the temporary parking passes for the business workers.

2127
02:45:28,114 --> 02:45:31,257
I, like many businesses here in the city, employ

2128
02:45:33,449 --> 02:45:41,453
individuals who work on a part-time basis who I cannot justify buying them a business parking permit for the year.

2129
02:45:42,553 --> 02:45:45,715
One of my workers comes in four hours a week, one day a week.

2130
02:45:45,855 --> 02:45:56,540
This past Monday, yesterday, I told him to stay home because I had been told that the enforcement was starting yesterday and I was not going to buy his vehicle a parking permit.

2131
02:45:57,400 --> 02:46:01,681
And I have since told my other worker to stay home until we can figure this out.

2132
02:46:03,342 --> 02:46:16,925
I went down to the Republic office yesterday in South Medford to buy my business permit, which I was always doing, and was listening to the frustrations of the residents in line who were buying their residential permits.

2133
02:46:17,485 --> 02:46:23,547
When they approached the counter, they were told, it's $10 for the year, and then you get two visitor placards by year.

2134
02:46:24,447 --> 02:46:27,728
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm paying $100 a year, and I got zilch.

2135
02:46:28,848 --> 02:46:39,190
All I'm asking is some considerations be given to those businesses who employ more than one employee and give us something to work with.

2136
02:46:39,490 --> 02:46:42,971
Because at the end of my lease, all I'm going to do is say, you know what, Medford?

2137
02:46:43,571 --> 02:46:44,151
Sayonara.

2138
02:46:45,211 --> 02:46:50,792
A few years ago, and I reiterate, quote unquote, the mayor stated the small businesses are the backbone of this community.

2139
02:46:51,152 --> 02:46:53,933
How are they the backbone of this community if you're trying to force us out?

2140
02:46:55,175 --> 02:46:56,116
That's my first issue.

2141
02:46:56,176 --> 02:46:59,898
Second issue is there's a small issue of what I'm calling discrimination.

2142
02:47:00,579 --> 02:47:06,543
So in West Medford, where I am, you have a lock shop, you have a dog groomer, and you have a convenience store and some place to eat.

2143
02:47:07,103 --> 02:47:10,205
Down on Salem Street, in between Paris and

2144
02:47:11,485 --> 02:47:13,605
park, you have the same types of stores.

2145
02:47:13,645 --> 02:47:16,906
You have a lock shop, a dog room, or someplace to eat, and a convenience store.

2146
02:47:17,546 --> 02:47:20,787
The only difference between those two areas and West Medford, you have to pay to park.

2147
02:47:21,107 --> 02:47:22,087
In that strip, you don't.

2148
02:47:22,467 --> 02:47:27,888
They are still businesses paying business taxes like I am, but their customers can park all day for free.

2149
02:47:28,528 --> 02:47:30,829
So that's what's really irritating me about this.

2150
02:47:31,429 --> 02:47:36,970
And any time I ask anyone with the city, including Republic, about answers, all I said is, we don't know.

2151
02:47:37,030 --> 02:47:37,790
We scratch our heads.

2152
02:47:38,670 --> 02:47:40,611
So I leave you with that tonight.

2153
02:47:40,731 --> 02:47:42,131
Thank you again for allowing me to speak.

2154
02:47:42,191 --> 02:47:45,952
Congratulations to our new president and vice president on the council here.

2155
02:47:46,352 --> 02:47:46,812
Thank you.

2156
02:47:46,852 --> 02:47:47,212
Thank you.

2157
02:47:52,754 --> 02:47:53,254
Good evening.

2158
02:47:53,334 --> 02:47:55,075
Please state your name and address for the record.

2159
02:47:55,095 --> 02:47:55,795
Certainly.

2160
02:47:56,275 --> 02:47:59,996
Andrew Castanetti, 23 Cushman street, Medford, Massachusetts.

2161
02:48:00,016 --> 02:48:01,316
Congratulations.

2162
02:48:01,376 --> 02:48:04,077
Council president and council vice president.

2163
02:48:07,001 --> 02:48:11,983
I'm no politician, as you can tell by my choice of words or lack of choice of words thereof.

2164
02:48:13,583 --> 02:48:15,744
Therefore, I call it the way I see it.

2165
02:48:18,465 --> 02:48:24,247
First off, it's very encouraging for a change to see all these people get civically involved.

2166
02:48:24,267 --> 02:48:32,290
I wish they were here for my residential real estate exemption last month.

2167
02:48:34,211 --> 02:48:34,591
Number two.

2168
02:48:36,704 --> 02:48:40,266
Once upon a time, Meffitt Square did have parking meters.

2169
02:48:41,567 --> 02:48:44,368
I believe when I was a teenager, they were there.

2170
02:48:46,750 --> 02:48:53,233
Number three, then the meters were removed and replaced with two-hour free parking signs.

2171
02:48:54,274 --> 02:49:01,157
However, for whatever reason or reasons, the two-hour limit was not consistently enforced.

2172
02:49:02,458 --> 02:49:05,840
And then number four, the parking

2173
02:49:06,735 --> 02:49:09,716
became abused from within and from without.

2174
02:49:10,236 --> 02:49:16,759
Out-of-towners taking the bus or the train into Boston or wherever.

2175
02:49:18,379 --> 02:49:27,062
Also, I believe most business owners want constant turnover for customer parking.

2176
02:49:28,903 --> 02:49:32,044
And six, and now the free parking party is over,

2177
02:49:32,835 --> 02:49:41,179
and we all must pay as we go or stop to park.

2178
02:49:43,741 --> 02:49:48,403
Seems that the valid contract is signed, right or wrong?

2179
02:49:51,445 --> 02:49:51,785
Good luck.

2180
02:49:55,147 --> 02:49:55,467
Thank you.

2181
02:49:55,547 --> 02:49:57,688
Sir, could you please state your name and address for the record?

2182
02:49:57,968 --> 02:49:58,788
Yes, Council President.

2183
02:49:58,829 --> 02:50:00,910
My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

2184
02:50:01,290 --> 02:50:19,081
I was at Dunkin' Donuts on Sunday, and I'm sitting in the window reading my paper at the crosswalk, and the crosswalk is all broken, seriously damaged, so if someone is walking on it, a woman with her high heels could fall easily, and then the crosswalk is faded.

2185
02:50:19,281 --> 02:50:21,162
Then you go a little further down, and

2186
02:50:22,429 --> 02:50:27,553
At the coin-operated laundry, the gutter, you could get your tire in that rut.

2187
02:50:27,593 --> 02:50:28,154
It's so big.

2188
02:50:28,554 --> 02:50:31,617
Now, this problem is across Medford.

2189
02:50:31,777 --> 02:50:37,542
My question is, how much money is Republic going to make from this compared to Medford?

2190
02:50:37,562 --> 02:50:39,684
Are they going to get 75% and we 25?

2191
02:50:39,904 --> 02:50:41,926
Are they going to get 99% and us 1?

2192
02:50:42,766 --> 02:50:43,907
Are we going to get 100%?

2193
02:50:44,027 --> 02:50:44,448
I don't know.

2194
02:50:44,488 --> 02:50:50,573
But if we're paying to park in this city and the streets are broken, we're getting a bill of goods here because

2195
02:50:51,788 --> 02:50:58,351
We're paying for premium space in what, I mean, Salem Street, Haines Square is starting to look like a third world country.

2196
02:50:58,371 --> 02:51:00,252
The litter is beyond control.

2197
02:51:00,733 --> 02:51:11,918
I don't see it in other communities, not in Woburn, not in Winchester, not in Stoneham, but here in Medford where I live, I'm constantly picking stuff up in front of my house, which blows in from the gas station, constantly.

2198
02:51:12,258 --> 02:51:15,340
So we have this litter and these broken streets.

2199
02:51:16,605 --> 02:51:21,126
The mayor's been in office for 28 years, and Republic has been in business a long time.

2200
02:51:21,986 --> 02:51:26,827
They're as efficient, and I'm not making a joke here, they're as efficient as the machines in the film The Matrix.

2201
02:51:26,947 --> 02:51:27,828
They know what they're doing.

2202
02:51:28,548 --> 02:51:30,008
They're very, very smart.

2203
02:51:31,248 --> 02:51:38,150
They didn't want us to have this on a public access station, which, by the way, we don't have anyways, but if we did, we would have had a discussion.

2204
02:51:39,066 --> 02:51:42,328
I have to thank Mayor D'Antonio for actually bringing the people out tonight.

2205
02:51:42,368 --> 02:51:43,468
Let's put it where it is.

2206
02:51:44,029 --> 02:51:48,491
The guy that ran for mayor is the guy doing the real heavy lifting here.

2207
02:51:48,891 --> 02:51:51,572
So thank you, Anthony, for doing the hard work and bringing people out.

2208
02:51:52,773 --> 02:51:55,534
We don't know about the street, and can we fix them?

2209
02:51:56,135 --> 02:51:59,676
Are we going to get money, serious money, to fix and pave our streets?

2210
02:51:59,696 --> 02:52:00,377
Because they're a mess.

2211
02:52:00,417 --> 02:52:02,658
Garfield Ave is pothole central.

2212
02:52:03,314 --> 02:52:06,277
Central Ave took a long time to fix, and I know it's late.

2213
02:52:06,677 --> 02:52:10,640
Locust Ave finally got fixed, but it's a little too late.

2214
02:52:11,481 --> 02:52:19,128
I would like to know, Republic, if you can tell us what kind of breakdown the city's going to make from this revenue enhancement program.

2215
02:52:30,659 --> 02:52:34,782
The contract with Republic in the city is a shared revenue contract.

2216
02:52:35,502 --> 02:52:47,330
Republic Parking is responsible for all of the capital investment, the kiosks and the vehicles and all of the labor and all of the technology that's required, the office rent and such and overhead that we have as a business.

2217
02:52:48,050 --> 02:52:55,975
And the revenues that will actually be earned will be determined by the results of the program, the amount of money that's generated from the program itself.

2218
02:52:56,616 --> 02:53:00,018
So it's based on a percentage of the actual revenues that are received.

2219
02:53:04,157 --> 02:53:14,005
There is a threshold, but basically the top threshold is 83% goes to the city and 17% goes to Republic out of which we have to pay all of our expenses.

2220
02:53:18,609 --> 02:53:19,630
Point of information.

2221
02:53:19,690 --> 02:53:20,751
Counselor Camuso.

2222
02:53:20,991 --> 02:53:21,371
Thank you.

2223
02:53:21,711 --> 02:53:24,594
And, um, a portion of that too,

2224
02:53:25,351 --> 02:53:31,354
set up by this council and the administration is earmarked to go right back into community development in the squares.

2225
02:53:32,175 --> 02:53:42,360
So whether it's hiring a consultant to try to bring in more business, whatever the case, whether it's physical infrastructure improvements of a particular square.

2226
02:53:42,781 --> 02:53:52,146
So this council, working with the solicitor's office and the mayor's office, we're adamant that a portion of this does go back to the business districts that are affected.

2227
02:53:53,166 --> 02:53:54,067
Thank you, councillor.

2228
02:53:55,011 --> 02:53:56,612
Councilor Pinto, did you have a point of information?

2229
02:53:56,652 --> 02:54:03,955
Yeah, Jack, I think, excuse me, Mr. Skelton, I think you indicated when you folks were here that you folks needed to do approximately $2 million a year in business?

2230
02:54:05,575 --> 02:54:08,216
That was the projections that were working off of, yes.

2231
02:54:08,577 --> 02:54:09,837
You needed $2 million a year.

2232
02:54:10,417 --> 02:54:13,359
And the city gets, after the first year, the city gets $300,000.

2233
02:54:14,319 --> 02:54:19,021
And then after the second year, the city gets $700,000, going up to the seventh year.

2234
02:54:19,041 --> 02:54:21,702
And then years eight, nine, and 10, it's a renegotiable too.

2235
02:54:22,122 --> 02:54:31,152
So if the city goes from $300,000 to $700,000, that's a $400,000 jump in one year, how much do you folks expect to make between the first and the second year?

2236
02:54:31,792 --> 02:54:34,295
Again, it depends on the amount of revenue generated.

2237
02:54:37,053 --> 02:54:39,855
Referencing there is the guaranteed portion of the contract.

2238
02:54:39,975 --> 02:54:40,395
Guaranteed.

2239
02:54:40,595 --> 02:54:41,756
That's the guaranteed number.

2240
02:54:42,356 --> 02:54:45,598
The threshold percentage breakdown is above that, sir.

2241
02:54:45,798 --> 02:54:52,542
So if we're guaranteed a minimum of 300,000 the first year, because you have to do the cost for the kiosks and everything else.

2242
02:54:52,862 --> 02:54:53,923
And the second year it jumps up 400,000.

2243
02:54:54,643 --> 02:54:59,906
So that's like 110% increase to the city, if not more.

2244
02:55:00,667 --> 02:55:02,588
If we meet the thresholds.

2245
02:55:02,848 --> 02:55:04,609
So if the thresholds are not met,

2246
02:55:05,720 --> 02:55:09,142
Isn't that an allowance for the city to opt out of the contract likewise with you?

2247
02:55:09,702 --> 02:55:12,564
The city has the option to terminate the contract at any time.

2248
02:55:12,904 --> 02:55:13,325
At any time?

2249
02:55:13,565 --> 02:55:13,865
Yes, sir.

2250
02:55:15,246 --> 02:55:16,607
No penalty, or what the penalty?

2251
02:55:17,187 --> 02:55:20,789
They would have to pay off the investment that was made in the parking program.

2252
02:55:20,989 --> 02:55:24,011
And how much is the investment right now, so far, approximately?

2253
02:55:24,812 --> 02:55:25,132
About $800,000.

2254
02:55:25,532 --> 02:55:25,732
About $800,000?

2255
02:55:25,772 --> 02:55:25,872
Yes.

2256
02:55:25,892 --> 02:55:27,633
Well, $800,000, that's for the cost of what, the kiosks and the signs?

2257
02:55:27,653 --> 02:55:27,713
Yes.

2258
02:55:35,815 --> 02:55:36,781
all of the technology.

2259
02:55:36,801 --> 02:55:38,552
Okay, all the technology and the science.

2260
02:55:40,859 --> 02:55:43,261
this supposedly 10 year deal.

2261
02:55:43,661 --> 02:55:45,462
Is this a rather long- Yeah, well, no, it is.

2262
02:55:45,522 --> 02:55:47,804
It's relative to the money part of what he was talking about.

2263
02:55:48,164 --> 02:55:49,645
It's a corollary, you know what those are?

2264
02:55:49,665 --> 02:55:50,886
The corollaries go like this.

2265
02:55:51,327 --> 02:55:54,069
The commentary was- It sounds like a run on sentence, councillor.

2266
02:55:54,209 --> 02:55:57,831
It's an $18 million contract, but it's not $18 million for the city of Medford.

2267
02:55:57,851 --> 02:56:01,894
This is an $18 million contract between you and the city and the city of Medford comes out of this.

2268
02:56:02,134 --> 02:56:07,038
If we follow just your projections, if everything is met to $7.9 million, not $18 million as reported.

2269
02:56:11,476 --> 02:56:23,002
If I understand that correctly, a guarantee of $300 the first year, $700 the next year, if everything is met for the next seven years, figure that out for the 10-year of the contract, it's $7.9 million, not $18 million.

2270
02:56:23,402 --> 02:56:26,123
The number you're quoting is not something that we provided.

2271
02:56:26,223 --> 02:56:28,544
That was an overall revenue projection.

2272
02:56:28,844 --> 02:56:30,925
But the revenue projection doesn't come to the city.

2273
02:56:32,286 --> 02:56:34,847
If we're getting $7.9, you're getting at least that, if not more.

2274
02:56:35,347 --> 02:56:35,768
No, sir.

2275
02:56:36,028 --> 02:56:37,328
I sure wish that was the case.

2276
02:56:37,689 --> 02:56:40,630
We're obligated for all the operating expenses, which are significant.

2277
02:56:41,601 --> 02:56:56,517
Well, I think maybe the city should really deeply investigate the fact that if we are locked into this for at least one year, we have an option to maybe look at this and maybe get out of it because I, you know, to be honest with you, that's an awful lot of money for you guys to think you're going to generate $2 million a year.

2278
02:56:57,678 --> 02:57:03,044
And the $2 million a year just might not happen if people figure out, listen, I'm not going to go there and spend this money in the computer.

2279
02:57:03,304 --> 02:57:04,285
I mean, in the kiosk,

2280
02:57:04,686 --> 02:57:08,189
As Councilor Knight has alluded to, why am I supposed to spend 35 cents to put a quarter into the meter?

2281
02:57:08,510 --> 02:57:09,731
That's another screwy thing.

2282
02:57:09,931 --> 02:57:18,720
And if you have a validation program, that's only going to hit certain people to the exclusion of other, which is discriminatory as far as I'm concerned, every single business needs to be treated the same.

2283
02:57:18,980 --> 02:57:22,083
And if they're not going to be treated the same, then the program can never work with equity.

2284
02:57:25,206 --> 02:57:26,467
Thank you, Councilor Penta.

2285
02:57:27,188 --> 02:57:28,389
Councilor Caraviello.

2286
02:57:28,870 --> 02:57:29,170
Thank you.

2287
02:57:30,201 --> 02:57:37,384
While you're here, can you explain how you're going to go around and tag these cars and not tag them?

2288
02:57:37,404 --> 02:57:38,344
Are you going to monitor this?

2289
02:57:39,105 --> 02:57:39,685
I'm confused.

2290
02:57:39,985 --> 02:57:41,005
Is there going to be people?

2291
02:57:41,466 --> 02:57:43,787
I'm hearing that you're going to have two cars going around the city.

2292
02:57:44,227 --> 02:57:50,629
Are there going to be people actually in West Medford, Method Square, actually doing things?

2293
02:57:51,330 --> 02:57:51,510
Yes.

2294
02:57:52,030 --> 02:57:54,551
All citations will be issued by our employees.

2295
02:57:54,891 --> 02:57:55,231
No, no, no.

2296
02:57:55,251 --> 02:57:55,631
It's not that.

2297
02:57:56,732 --> 02:57:59,713
Is there going to be a person walking around Method Square

2298
02:58:00,036 --> 02:58:02,017
Are you doing this all via the vehicle?

2299
02:58:02,577 --> 02:58:07,398
There will be a combination of vehicle patrols and foot patrols, but primarily vehicle patrols.

2300
02:58:07,858 --> 02:58:11,339
And that allows us to be very efficient and numbers.

2301
02:58:12,200 --> 02:58:14,881
How many vehicles are going to be circling the city?

2302
02:58:14,901 --> 02:58:18,882
We have two LPR vehicles that will be utilized for the program.

2303
02:58:20,682 --> 02:58:21,823
So two vehicles?

2304
02:58:22,863 --> 02:58:23,163
Yes, sir.

2305
02:58:23,283 --> 02:58:24,303
Can do permit parking?

2306
02:58:25,824 --> 02:58:26,184
Yes, sir.

2307
02:58:26,224 --> 02:58:26,644
Parking?

2308
02:58:28,925 --> 02:58:29,205
Yes, sir.

2309
02:58:30,650 --> 02:58:34,152
We have as a correlation, as a comparison in other cities.

2310
02:58:34,232 --> 02:58:35,333
So you're going to be driving.

2311
02:58:35,673 --> 02:58:37,434
Who's going to give out the citation in the car?

2312
02:58:37,474 --> 02:58:40,736
Is the gentleman or lady going to get out of the car and put a ticket on the window?

2313
02:58:41,356 --> 02:58:41,536
Yes.

2314
02:58:41,556 --> 02:58:43,157
Or are they going to put their hand on it?

2315
02:58:43,277 --> 02:58:44,178
Yes, that's correct.

2316
02:58:44,378 --> 02:58:47,079
All the tickets will be placed on the vehicle by our officer.

2317
02:58:47,460 --> 02:58:49,021
This is a commonly used practice.

2318
02:58:49,201 --> 02:58:50,421
That'll be in the vehicle, correct?

2319
02:58:51,202 --> 02:58:52,342
Yes, they're in the vehicle.

2320
02:58:52,422 --> 02:58:56,785
They'll make the identification of a violation and then get out of the vehicle and issue the citation.

2321
02:58:57,127 --> 02:58:59,589
Now who's gonna monitor if there's a handicapped placard in the window?

2322
02:59:00,189 --> 02:59:03,531
That will be our officers as well as the police department.

2323
02:59:03,551 --> 02:59:08,214
So before you give a ticket to my car, you know, look to make sure there's not a handicapped placard in the window?

2324
02:59:08,475 --> 02:59:08,835
Yes, sir.

2325
02:59:09,175 --> 02:59:10,036
Okay.

2326
02:59:10,476 --> 02:59:11,116
What about towing?

2327
02:59:11,136 --> 02:59:13,238
Are any of these guys ever gonna be towed?

2328
02:59:14,719 --> 02:59:17,881
Under the current ordinances, a scoff law is eligible for towing.

2329
02:59:18,421 --> 02:59:20,162
Who makes the decision on who gets towed?

2330
02:59:20,663 --> 02:59:21,724
That's by ordinance.

2331
02:59:23,104 --> 02:59:23,365
I mean, so,

2332
02:59:25,100 --> 02:59:31,943
If you drive by the same car that's been there for two or three days, you call the police department and say, this guy's been there, we should have a toad.

2333
02:59:32,003 --> 02:59:33,524
I mean, who makes that decision who gets toad?

2334
02:59:34,764 --> 02:59:37,125
It's authorized through the police department to make a toad.

2335
02:59:37,145 --> 02:59:37,766
So the police department's?

2336
02:59:38,146 --> 02:59:38,346
Yes, sir.

2337
02:59:38,666 --> 02:59:40,247
By current ordinance, that's how it reads.

2338
02:59:41,447 --> 02:59:43,348
Okay, two more questions, one more question.

2339
02:59:44,449 --> 02:59:50,291
Governors Avenue and Forest Street, there's no kiosk or meters on those two streets?

2340
02:59:51,492 --> 02:59:52,672
The initial kiosk.

2341
02:59:52,752 --> 02:59:54,253
Are you just gonna enforce the signs?

2342
02:59:55,832 --> 03:00:03,776
The initial kiosk location was per a consultant study that was done prior to the RFP being issued for this contract.

2343
03:00:04,116 --> 03:00:13,401
So all the locations for the kiosk with a few exceptions, uh, were per that report by the consultant, the city hired to do a study of the city.

2344
03:00:14,282 --> 03:00:21,626
So we work with cities across the country and I can tell this council and the citizenry that it's always a dynamic situation.

2345
03:00:22,246 --> 03:00:24,107
Even parking programs have been placed for,

2346
03:00:25,075 --> 03:00:28,536
50, 60 years, there's always changes that are ongoing.

2347
03:00:28,576 --> 03:00:36,979
No, but my question was, Forest Street, there seems to be an awful lot of parking on Forest Street, and also on Governor's Ave, people that leave their cars there all day.

2348
03:00:37,820 --> 03:00:40,020
Are you just gonna enforce the signs that are already there?

2349
03:00:40,841 --> 03:00:45,022
Yes, if there's not a kiosk, it'll be per the ordinance and the time limits that are in place.

2350
03:00:45,042 --> 03:00:52,445
Okay, now who's gonna, now is your signal tracking software gonna be able to say that that car's been there for two hours?

2351
03:00:52,865 --> 03:00:53,185
Yes, sir.

2352
03:00:57,663 --> 03:01:10,353
A few weeks ago, when the last time you were here, I had asked that you'd come back in 60 days and we could review what's gone on in the past.

2353
03:01:10,974 --> 03:01:12,175
Can we still adhere to that?

2354
03:01:12,535 --> 03:01:13,015
Absolutely.

2355
03:01:13,075 --> 03:01:15,657
I'm available to meet any time that you'd like.

2356
03:01:15,717 --> 03:01:16,338
I think it's important.

2357
03:01:16,638 --> 03:01:21,742
Will yourself and the parking representative come back so we can say, look, it's been 60 days.

2358
03:01:22,826 --> 03:01:26,227
these are the problems that are really sticking out, and maybe make some changes then?

2359
03:01:26,607 --> 03:01:27,108
Absolutely.

2360
03:01:28,108 --> 03:01:28,268
Okay.

2361
03:01:32,310 --> 03:01:36,211
Sir, if you could state your name and address for the record.

2362
03:01:36,231 --> 03:01:37,692
Larry Carroll, 31 Richard Street, Medford.

2363
03:01:38,712 --> 03:01:42,093
I just heard the gentleman refer to his staff.

2364
03:01:42,393 --> 03:01:43,574
Are they officers?

2365
03:01:43,894 --> 03:01:45,755
Are they employees of this company?

2366
03:01:46,595 --> 03:01:48,916
I'm not quite too sure what that definition of

2367
03:01:49,605 --> 03:01:53,606
officers mean, and maybe if you could clarify that a little clearer.

2368
03:02:00,288 --> 03:02:05,610
The use of the term officers is not in any way to indicate that they're police officers.

2369
03:02:06,230 --> 03:02:09,791
They're what we call enforcement officers in the industry, parking enforcement officers.

2370
03:02:10,211 --> 03:02:12,892
The term we actually intend to use is ambassadors.

2371
03:02:17,194 --> 03:02:23,860
We hear that in a lot of cities, but we're very successful in rolling our people out to promote the downtown, promote events, to share information.

2372
03:02:23,880 --> 03:02:26,802
I think he's referring to the ticket writers.

2373
03:02:27,403 --> 03:02:28,363
That's what I'm talking about.

2374
03:02:29,785 --> 03:02:30,145
Good luck.

2375
03:02:34,929 --> 03:02:37,231
Mr. Carol, do you have sir?

2376
03:02:40,914 --> 03:02:43,096
Vincent Ciano, 31 Henry street.

2377
03:02:44,157 --> 03:02:45,798
Uh, it seems like a, an awful,

2378
03:02:46,307 --> 03:02:47,627
confusing program.

2379
03:02:48,588 --> 03:02:54,689
It seems like there are more questions than answers, just by all the questions that the counselors have.

2380
03:02:55,649 --> 03:03:02,751
But it seems that the people I talk to most don't even know anything about the program at all.

2381
03:03:03,631 --> 03:03:06,512
And others know very little.

2382
03:03:06,792 --> 03:03:09,613
I don't think this pamphlet explains too much.

2383
03:03:10,473 --> 03:03:13,254
But what it boils down to is that

2384
03:03:14,356 --> 03:03:20,679
I don't know if the people realize it or not, but now they can't park anywhere in Medford without paying a fee.

2385
03:03:21,760 --> 03:03:26,562
You can't park in front of your own home unless you have a permit and pay a fee.

2386
03:03:27,463 --> 03:03:28,984
Small, but it's still a fee.

2387
03:03:29,884 --> 03:03:32,745
So where do you park?

2388
03:03:34,046 --> 03:03:34,867
It's ridiculous.

2389
03:03:37,708 --> 03:03:38,048
Thank you.

2390
03:03:38,408 --> 03:03:39,009
Thank you, sir.

2391
03:03:40,549 --> 03:03:41,390
Councilor Camuso.

2392
03:03:42,200 --> 03:03:45,721
If I may, this brings up a follow up question and this would be to the chief.

2393
03:03:46,522 --> 03:03:52,184
There are some traditionally we know which streets right now in the community of resident permit parking only.

2394
03:03:53,604 --> 03:04:00,927
I'm assuming there's going to be a residual effect on this because now people are going to be leaving place dead road to park and they're going to be parking up the side streets and all that.

2395
03:04:01,908 --> 03:04:09,631
At this point, there's some scuttlebutt out there that there's other streets that were added as resident parking permit recently in anticipation of this program.

2396
03:04:09,691 --> 03:04:10,431
Is that true or false?

2397
03:04:11,289 --> 03:04:11,830
That's false.

2398
03:04:12,050 --> 03:04:12,410
That's false.

2399
03:04:12,530 --> 03:04:15,673
One inquiry, one inquiry from a resident of Clulee road.

2400
03:04:15,973 --> 03:04:16,193
Okay.

2401
03:04:16,654 --> 03:04:19,676
Because they're the first street that does not have permit parking.

2402
03:04:19,696 --> 03:04:20,897
I've just had that one inquiry.

2403
03:04:21,598 --> 03:04:24,681
She was advised what she needed to do to get it before the traffic commission.

2404
03:04:25,622 --> 03:04:26,662
But that was just the other day.

2405
03:04:27,023 --> 03:04:29,265
The last street that was added was Hamilton street.

2406
03:04:29,365 --> 03:04:30,366
I got one more question.

2407
03:04:30,746 --> 03:04:35,210
On that, what you just said on Clulee road, I've had to call some other residents saying that

2408
03:04:35,974 --> 03:04:42,096
They're being told that business people have been told can park on certain residential streets.

2409
03:04:42,916 --> 03:04:51,959
It's not, well, David designated as business overflow, business parking can park on certain streets outside the business.

2410
03:04:52,079 --> 03:05:02,942
As I stated to two weeks ago in West Medford square between Hammond place and Brooke street, I believe it's one hour or business by a business permit.

2411
03:05:03,402 --> 03:05:05,483
And then between Brooks and Alston,

2412
03:05:06,429 --> 03:05:09,414
On High Street is two hour of business permits.

2413
03:05:09,434 --> 03:05:10,997
So there's a combination of those two.

2414
03:05:11,017 --> 03:05:11,538
On High Street?

2415
03:05:11,558 --> 03:05:12,941
What about on those side streets?

2416
03:05:12,961 --> 03:05:13,081
No.

2417
03:05:13,361 --> 03:05:13,502
No.

2418
03:05:13,802 --> 03:05:13,922
No.

2419
03:05:14,123 --> 03:05:14,724
Just on High Street.

2420
03:05:14,744 --> 03:05:17,589
Unless there's a street there that's not permit parking.

2421
03:05:18,410 --> 03:05:21,712
If there's no permit parking, if there's no restriction, they can park.

2422
03:05:22,072 --> 03:05:22,272
Thank you.

2423
03:05:22,853 --> 03:05:27,255
And that would be up to, because I know exactly what he's referring to, the Cottage Street that I talked to you about.

2424
03:05:27,315 --> 03:05:29,676
I've answered several questions from people on Cottage Street.

2425
03:05:29,736 --> 03:05:30,196
Exactly.

2426
03:05:30,236 --> 03:05:31,597
Somehow the rumors get started.

2427
03:05:31,977 --> 03:05:32,918
And that's the problem.

2428
03:05:33,058 --> 03:05:34,799
There's just a lot of misinformation.

2429
03:05:34,819 --> 03:05:36,980
And you put a lot of people at ease, though.

2430
03:05:37,320 --> 03:05:38,321
The proof is in the pudding.

2431
03:05:38,401 --> 03:05:44,464
Once it starts rolling out and actually gets implemented, just what I'm hearing about the permit parking,

2432
03:05:45,485 --> 03:05:49,788
took a lot of complaints from the public because we weren't doing enough permit parking enforcement.

2433
03:05:50,708 --> 03:05:52,629
I'm looking forward to seeing that done.

2434
03:05:52,649 --> 03:05:57,192
I think you'll see a big change that that that will be a major impact for the residents.

2435
03:05:57,852 --> 03:06:07,758
And then, um, my second follow up question is regarding the, uh, the streets and the permit streets for the viewing public, because there will be the residual effect like, um, some street that's not already residential.

2436
03:06:07,798 --> 03:06:08,579
People may try to,

2437
03:06:09,339 --> 03:06:17,869
beat the system, I'm not going to pay the $5 to park on Police Dead Road, so I'm going to go to one of those streets, Century Woods, Roberts, anything.

2438
03:06:19,511 --> 03:06:27,321
If any streets see an influx of vehicles parking, they should get together and petition the community, the City of Medford, through the Chief and the Traffic Commission,

2439
03:06:27,841 --> 03:06:36,892
to take a look at making it resident permit parking, because I know that you and the Traffic Commission, what's the official name now?

2440
03:06:36,912 --> 03:06:37,713
Traffic Commission, right?

2441
03:06:37,733 --> 03:06:39,435
Still Traffic Commission.

2442
03:06:39,555 --> 03:06:42,659
With the merging of the off-street parking.

2443
03:06:42,962 --> 03:06:46,044
But with that being said, I think people have to be cognizant of that.

2444
03:06:46,084 --> 03:06:57,371
If you see an additional people park on your street, and traditionally you can tell when they're out of town is because they have stickers for the dump in Winchester or Lexington Boys and Girls Club or something like that.

2445
03:06:57,752 --> 03:07:07,078
So, but if you see an influx of that, bring it to our attention as a city council, the mayor or the chief, and we'll get you before the traffic commission and the chief will do his due diligence.

2446
03:07:07,098 --> 03:07:10,160
All they have to do is generate a petition

2447
03:07:10,680 --> 03:07:13,543
get several names of residents on the street that are in favor of it.

2448
03:07:14,463 --> 03:07:14,984
Have a hearing.

2449
03:07:15,004 --> 03:07:25,192
And Albert Erickson processes that, sends notices out to all of the residents that are listed for that street so that they get to come to a meeting or a call or send us a note whether they're in favor or opposed.

2450
03:07:27,294 --> 03:07:42,045
Well, I'm glad I'm glad you updated the council miss because there was a lot of banter going back and forth that all half the city now is resident permit parking only that they Because of this and at this point there's only been one addition to the last one was Hamilton Hamilton Street And that was two months ago.

2451
03:07:42,165 --> 03:07:50,432
Okay before this was even and for this because this is going live, can you work with the city administration to maybe get the the

2452
03:07:51,221 --> 03:08:01,287
the traffic commission's agenda on the city webpage, so people can take a look at it and see what streets around them may be affected by it, and then you can have maximum input from the area.

2453
03:08:02,547 --> 03:08:03,268
Thank you, Chief.

2454
03:08:03,788 --> 03:08:04,808
Thank you, Councilor Cusum.

2455
03:08:04,828 --> 03:08:08,450
Before we go to Councilor Mox, the chair has no paper before it.

2456
03:08:09,331 --> 03:08:11,772
This has been an informational session.

2457
03:08:11,932 --> 03:08:18,316
If the councilors want to formulate a resolution for us to end this with, the chair will entertain that.

2458
03:08:18,376 --> 03:08:20,097
I would like to- Councilor Mox.

2459
03:08:21,654 --> 03:08:22,495
Thank you, Mr. President.

2460
03:08:22,556 --> 03:08:25,763
Chief, just if I could, we referred back to the

2461
03:08:26,385 --> 03:08:34,707
parking committee in 2009, one of the recommendations was to have citywide permit parking, or at least to be reviewed.

2462
03:08:35,287 --> 03:08:36,708
And that's part of the report.

2463
03:08:37,168 --> 03:08:40,929
Has there been any movement on reviewing citywide permit parking?

2464
03:08:40,949 --> 03:08:46,650
Because the approach of having it done piecemeal right now is not adequate enough.

2465
03:08:47,550 --> 03:08:53,572
Residents are sending us emails stating the permit only is issued for your particular street.

2466
03:08:54,019 --> 03:09:05,164
So if you want to go visit your sister or your aunt or your cousin, still in Method, you can't take your resident permit parking sticker and go to another section of Method, which to me is ridiculous.

2467
03:09:05,184 --> 03:09:05,744
That's correct.

2468
03:09:05,824 --> 03:09:07,205
And that's age old.

2469
03:09:07,625 --> 03:09:13,067
When the permit parking regulations were formed back in the late seventies, early eighties, it was street by street.

2470
03:09:13,548 --> 03:09:17,669
And at that time, for the most part, it was the hillside area around Tufts university.

2471
03:09:18,330 --> 03:09:20,311
But there has been discussion.

2472
03:09:20,331 --> 03:09:23,132
I've spoken with Dan Nash and uh,

2473
03:09:23,628 --> 03:09:30,073
you know, there's, there's now we're going to have some data to look at and really see what the impact will be on permanent parking.

2474
03:09:30,673 --> 03:09:37,539
And we either will go through a zone so that, you know, it's a neighborhood area or we'll go citywide.

2475
03:09:38,279 --> 03:09:48,507
But I don't see that happening before next year because everyone's getting their permit now and it's street by street because I think there's still going to be an equal number of people who want

2476
03:09:49,393 --> 03:09:51,534
you know, just their street, which really isn't right.

2477
03:09:51,574 --> 03:10:04,543
Every time we talk to a group, we let them know, okay, it was passed for your street, but remember you're part of a neighborhood and you know, someone on the next street over whose permits, who has a permit, it's just not enough spaces.

2478
03:10:04,583 --> 03:10:07,785
They should be able to park on this street because it's just down the street from their house.

2479
03:10:08,246 --> 03:10:09,026
It's part of a neighborhood.

2480
03:10:09,046 --> 03:10:10,007
So we're looking at zone.

2481
03:10:10,633 --> 03:10:13,115
either doing by zone or doing citywide.

2482
03:10:13,715 --> 03:10:24,103
So anyone in the city who's registered in the city, even if they don't have a permit parking street, if they want to purchase a permit so that they have the opportunity to park, there'd be no reason to deny them.

2483
03:10:24,744 --> 03:10:35,152
And chief, and I think Gwen Blackburn, who's still here, can attest to the fact when we visited Malden, Everett, Somerville, Boston, the committee itself,

2484
03:10:36,095 --> 03:10:39,076
everyone came back to us and said, you know what?

2485
03:10:39,836 --> 03:10:43,597
Keep whatever parking enforcement you do free from city hall.

2486
03:10:44,177 --> 03:10:45,657
Don't locate it at city hall.

2487
03:10:45,757 --> 03:10:47,058
Keep it away from city hall.

2488
03:10:47,918 --> 03:10:49,738
And we heard that over and over again.

2489
03:10:50,499 --> 03:10:54,660
And what we did was create an enforcement office on main street, which is great.

2490
03:10:54,980 --> 03:10:56,160
That's free from city hall.

2491
03:10:56,800 --> 03:11:01,721
But the mayor outsourced everything other than the hearings, the appeals.

2492
03:11:02,862 --> 03:11:03,882
The one thing you'd say,

2493
03:11:04,409 --> 03:11:06,851
We don't want to be involved with the appeal process.

2494
03:11:07,251 --> 03:11:08,572
The mayor kept that in-house.

2495
03:11:09,172 --> 03:11:12,194
He not only kept it in-house, he kept it here at City Hall.

2496
03:11:13,735 --> 03:11:18,518
So it flies in the face of everything that we heard in the past.

2497
03:11:19,358 --> 03:11:33,727
And then the mayor took it one step further and said that he didn't believe with this new enforcement program that there was going to be an increase that would merit or warrant someone, because we only have a part-time person that does the hearings now.

2498
03:11:34,325 --> 03:11:43,107
and he didn't believe, with all this new ticketing, that we would need someone to do hearings, which makes no sense at all to me.

2499
03:11:43,607 --> 03:11:44,627
Absolutely no sense.

2500
03:11:45,128 --> 03:11:48,888
So the two points is, leaving it out of city hall, he kept it here.

2501
03:11:49,549 --> 03:12:03,792
The other point is, you have a part-time person, Diane McLeod, who works full-time at a real job, and does this on a part-time, and now she's gonna be asked to do a program that, there was no enforcement in the city, very little,

2502
03:12:04,298 --> 03:12:05,679
to now full-blown enforcement.

2503
03:12:06,159 --> 03:12:07,439
I just don't see it happening.

2504
03:12:07,779 --> 03:12:13,342
We asked that money be put in the budget to pay for another hearing officer, and the mayor denied it.

2505
03:12:13,902 --> 03:12:17,644
So I still don't know how that's going to work, Chief.

2506
03:12:17,744 --> 03:12:19,824
That change may happen down the road again.

2507
03:12:19,844 --> 03:12:22,926
I know the situation went down the road when they see what the impact is.

2508
03:12:22,986 --> 03:12:26,847
But Diane McLeod obviously does a great job with what she does.

2509
03:12:26,927 --> 03:12:28,388
And I have to tell you that

2510
03:12:29,448 --> 03:12:31,690
She goes out and researches any ticket appeal.

2511
03:12:31,730 --> 03:12:32,771
She goes out to the streets.

2512
03:12:33,271 --> 03:12:36,313
She looks at the neighborhoods that where the person was cited.

2513
03:12:36,434 --> 03:12:44,079
She calls the police department, Sergeant Carroll sometime at the current flow chief at the car, which is minimal to none, but she does a thorough job.

2514
03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:45,861
But with this program,

2515
03:12:46,560 --> 03:12:50,221
Even if she gets 100 appeals, there's going to be backup data.

2516
03:12:50,241 --> 03:12:52,342
You're going to have a picture of the car in violation.

2517
03:12:52,622 --> 03:12:54,603
You have two options.

2518
03:12:54,803 --> 03:12:56,603
You pay the ticket, or you appeal.

2519
03:12:56,623 --> 03:13:04,866
But Chief, think about all the different policies that haven't been outlined yet, all the different appeals that people are going to come up with and say, you know what, you told me this or that.

2520
03:13:04,886 --> 03:13:08,687
That person is going to be inundated with hearings.

2521
03:13:08,747 --> 03:13:12,029
And I think initially, she will be inundated.

2522
03:13:12,309 --> 03:13:16,350
But as time goes on and compliance rates pick up, which we've seen in the past, whenever we did

2523
03:13:17,202 --> 03:13:22,725
extensive ticketing, within a week or two, you got compliance, and the tickets started to drop off because people complied.

2524
03:13:23,085 --> 03:13:26,906
And then, when you went away for a month, things went back to the old way.

2525
03:13:27,807 --> 03:13:33,890
I honestly believe, after a few months of regular, consistent, steady enforcement, you will see compliance.

2526
03:13:34,710 --> 03:13:36,851
But I agree, the first few months are going to be difficult.

2527
03:13:36,871 --> 03:13:41,473
The President And if we see compliance, Republicans are going to be in a lot of trouble because they're not going to get their revenue.

2528
03:13:42,542 --> 03:13:44,743
Their revenue is not based on feeding the meter.

2529
03:13:45,023 --> 03:13:45,843
It's based on ticketing.

2530
03:13:45,863 --> 03:13:46,923
In life, there's risk, right?

2531
03:13:46,963 --> 03:13:49,884
Two-thirds of their revenue is based on ticketing, not meters.

2532
03:13:51,385 --> 03:13:56,286
So if compliance is there, and I hope that's correct, they're going to be out of business very shortly.

2533
03:13:57,026 --> 03:13:59,387
Well, I look at Somerville as the model.

2534
03:14:00,027 --> 03:14:01,828
$8 million a year, and they keep climbing.

2535
03:14:01,848 --> 03:14:03,308
Yeah, but they hide behind bushes, Chief.

2536
03:14:03,328 --> 03:14:04,708
And you said that's not going to happen in Method.

2537
03:14:05,609 --> 03:14:07,769
Because there's enough low-bearing fruit to grab.

2538
03:14:07,929 --> 03:14:09,290
We don't have to hide behind the bushes.

2539
03:14:11,825 --> 03:14:13,266
Thank you, Chief.

2540
03:14:13,286 --> 03:14:16,829
Thank you.

2541
03:14:16,929 --> 03:14:22,733
Chief, do you have any idea right now under the current system what percentage of tickets are issued?

2542
03:14:24,114 --> 03:14:25,995
What percentage of issued tickets are appealed?

2543
03:14:27,116 --> 03:14:27,776
I don't know.

2544
03:14:30,638 --> 03:14:34,321
I think the bulk of the appeals happen with snow emergencies and street sweeping.

2545
03:14:34,821 --> 03:14:39,384
That's probably the heaviest time we do any ticketing, or have been doing over the past couple of years.

2546
03:14:40,265 --> 03:14:40,485
Thank you.

2547
03:14:42,178 --> 03:14:43,039
All set, Councilor Knight?

2548
03:14:43,219 --> 03:14:43,599
Yes, thank you.

2549
03:14:43,999 --> 03:14:44,740
Councilor Penta?

2550
03:14:44,760 --> 03:14:47,261
Chief, at the outset, I probably should have said this right in the beginning.

2551
03:14:48,522 --> 03:14:49,283
You don't belong here.

2552
03:14:49,323 --> 03:14:50,083
The mayor belongs here.

2553
03:14:50,123 --> 03:14:51,264
This is not your program.

2554
03:14:51,284 --> 03:14:52,324
This is the mayor's program.

2555
03:14:52,565 --> 03:14:53,765
And I'm involved.

2556
03:14:53,845 --> 03:14:56,327
And you're doing his nasty work right now.

2557
03:14:56,367 --> 03:14:57,048
That's number one.

2558
03:14:57,448 --> 03:15:04,092
About three weeks ago, Dan, you and I, and I think a fellow by the name of John N. Candola, met at the coffee shop.

2559
03:15:04,652 --> 03:15:06,594
I want to get back to your comment, Councilor Marks.

2560
03:15:07,423 --> 03:15:10,085
We had a lot of conversation about a lot of the concerns that are out there.

2561
03:15:10,106 --> 03:15:13,909
And I think you agreed and you said basically a lot of the things you and I were talking about, you agreed.

2562
03:15:14,530 --> 03:15:17,252
One big issue, the appeal process.

2563
03:15:17,352 --> 03:15:18,113
And what did you say?

2564
03:15:18,173 --> 03:15:18,914
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2565
03:15:18,954 --> 03:15:19,694
I'll paraphrase you.

2566
03:15:20,175 --> 03:15:24,619
You said, if there was one thing you oppressed upon the mayor, keep it out of city hall, get an outside independent person.

2567
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:26,561
That's what you said.

2568
03:15:30,749 --> 03:15:32,490
Dan Nash, Regional Manager of Public Parking.

2569
03:15:33,091 --> 03:15:45,478
One of the things that we had suggested was to provide administrative hearing through our office to try to weed out some of the appeals that may come through that could be administered prior to going to City Hall.

2570
03:15:45,518 --> 03:15:53,083
But at no point were we anticipating removing anyone, the final administrative hearing process or the hearing process from City Hall.

2571
03:15:53,123 --> 03:15:54,244
That was never on the table.

2572
03:15:54,704 --> 03:15:59,767
No, you indicated at that point in time, it would be wise and advisable to hire an outside independent person

2573
03:16:00,191 --> 03:16:04,112
That way there would be no conflict as it relates to the parking ticket and city hall.

2574
03:16:04,392 --> 03:16:20,658
But what I talked to you about is something that we had done in Springfield, Mass, where we had hired a outside attorney to come in and administrative hearings, uh, through the office to try to take care of some of the burden that might be left on the city's actual appeal process.

2575
03:16:20,738 --> 03:16:25,179
So your recommendation is almost the same, whether it be Springfield and Medford or what have you.

2576
03:16:25,439 --> 03:16:26,940
Why should Medford be any different than Springfield?

2577
03:16:28,862 --> 03:16:29,923
I think every city's different.

2578
03:16:30,363 --> 03:16:31,143
Springfield's huge.

2579
03:16:31,904 --> 03:16:41,810
And I think part of that and discussions with the administration is to allow the process to go see what happens.

2580
03:16:41,890 --> 03:16:47,814
I think the chief explained it very well just briefly is we know that the first couple of months there will probably be an influx in appeals.

2581
03:16:48,334 --> 03:16:54,578
And if we see that that number is not dwindling down, then there are options that we could put into place to help assist with the appeal process.

2582
03:16:55,879 --> 03:16:57,780
Well, I think that's something that should have been discussed

2583
03:16:58,292 --> 03:17:10,939
and finalized and included in the contract, but just for the type of terminology that you're saying, that if in fact it gets to a point in time, as Councilor Moxley alluded to, and then an outside independent person needs to come in if they want to start off small, but the mayor was adamant.

2584
03:17:11,439 --> 03:17:17,322
So if the mayor is going to be that adamant that Diane McLeod is a lovely person, she does her job, she has a full-time job to do.

2585
03:17:17,963 --> 03:17:23,686
So I don't know how she's going to be able to pick up and chief, even though you said she may get all the technological thing, it might go up to a hundred.

2586
03:17:23,746 --> 03:17:25,687
I mean, a hundred appeals is a hundred appeals.

2587
03:17:25,707 --> 03:17:27,848
That's a lot to take care of during a period of time.

2588
03:17:28,407 --> 03:17:35,572
But all I know is this, that if I was a contributor to the mayor of this community, and I wound up getting a ticket, I'd be knocking on his door and saying, hey, what's this all about?

2589
03:17:35,832 --> 03:17:37,533
Oh, you're not going to get another contribution from me.

2590
03:17:38,133 --> 03:17:40,235
Because he kept it here in City Hall, which is wrong.

2591
03:17:40,815 --> 03:17:41,836
It should be out of City Hall.

2592
03:17:42,096 --> 03:17:46,899
If this program really wanted to work its way right, it would be completely independent to anything that's political.

2593
03:17:47,419 --> 03:17:51,402
And if you have to work out these little things, Councilor Camuso, I probably agree with you in one thing.

2594
03:17:52,142 --> 03:17:52,662
And that's this.

2595
03:17:53,183 --> 03:17:53,303
Yeah.

2596
03:17:53,628 --> 03:17:55,309
on this particular thing, and I think it's a big one.

2597
03:17:55,389 --> 03:18:07,839
I think if you were going to put meters in the city, you should have put meters so everybody that drove up would have seen them, they would have been able to understand it, the signage would have said how long you could have stayed, and this would have relieved an awful lot, an awful lot of the grief that's here.

2598
03:18:08,185 --> 03:18:10,486
But your inconsistencies are all over the city.

2599
03:18:10,506 --> 03:18:14,667
I'm not saying you, because you guys are only doing as you said where the mayor told you to do.

2600
03:18:15,187 --> 03:18:30,873
I don't understand how you can go down Main Street from Medford Square to South Medford and have blocks of stores, have nothing at all, and then go to West Medford where there are kiosks, go to Haines Square where there are kiosks, and then Haines Square, at the end of Haines Square come to Medford Square,

2601
03:18:31,363 --> 03:18:36,447
as Mr. Dobbs indicated, have had the same blocks of stores, like businesses, not having anything.

2602
03:18:37,047 --> 03:18:45,313
And if you're going to say you're going to roll it out further, there's another phase to this, that means there's going to be more anguish and more heartache to the people in this community.

2603
03:18:46,133 --> 03:18:47,314
We're not Newbury Street.

2604
03:18:47,354 --> 03:18:49,295
We don't have to get up at 7 o'clock in the morning.

2605
03:18:49,476 --> 03:18:59,603
And Newbury Street in Boston is the only place where they did this experiment with the kiosk, because the other parts of Boston still have the, and Brookline, who had the kiosk, got rid of it, because it was damning to the business community out there.

2606
03:19:00,183 --> 03:19:01,544
We're not one of these communities.

2607
03:19:01,785 --> 03:19:03,086
We're a simple little community.

2608
03:19:03,786 --> 03:19:04,827
Point of information.

2609
03:19:05,768 --> 03:19:15,778
Councillor Knight.

2610
03:19:15,818 --> 03:19:19,221
Canal Street, Friend Street, Portland Street, they all have kiosks.

2611
03:19:19,521 --> 03:19:20,282
It's not station.

2612
03:19:20,342 --> 03:19:21,483
It's not downtown Boston.

2613
03:19:22,782 --> 03:19:31,031
A number of different communities in New York City, New York State, California, Los Angeles County, they have kiosks.

2614
03:19:31,211 --> 03:19:36,157
I think that they're new, they're scary, but at the end of the day, we're going to be able to figure it out.

2615
03:19:36,177 --> 03:19:38,059
I don't think that we're giving the public enough credit.

2616
03:19:38,439 --> 03:19:41,842
in terms of their ability to adapt to new technology.

2617
03:19:41,903 --> 03:19:42,463
We've all done it.

2618
03:19:42,743 --> 03:19:47,368
We've seen people come along and be able to work computers like wizards after a couple of weeks.

2619
03:19:47,748 --> 03:19:48,469
It is what it is.

2620
03:19:48,529 --> 03:19:56,977
I think that, you know, we're in a situation right now where we can go and we can talk about the past and we can talk about what happened, or we can look forward to see, all right, these are coming in.

2621
03:19:57,217 --> 03:19:58,018
What's the process?

2622
03:19:58,078 --> 03:20:00,920
How are we going to deal with our griefs and our gripes and our grievances?

2623
03:20:01,381 --> 03:20:03,583
And in order for us to move forward,

2624
03:20:03,906 --> 03:20:06,549
I think we really need to look at the plan and say the plan's in place.

2625
03:20:07,310 --> 03:20:09,012
These are the, these are the recourses that we have.

2626
03:20:09,353 --> 03:20:10,534
The traffic commission governs.

2627
03:20:11,195 --> 03:20:14,158
We have the traffic commission and we go to the traffic commission.

2628
03:20:14,439 --> 03:20:15,119
That's the process.

2629
03:20:15,139 --> 03:20:16,181
There's a process in place.

2630
03:20:16,221 --> 03:20:24,050
Now we can talk about the process that didn't happen to get us to where we are, or we can look forward and we can say, this is the process that we need to take in order to make this a successful plan.

2631
03:20:24,544 --> 03:20:26,446
And that's where I am with this, Mr. President.

2632
03:20:26,726 --> 03:20:29,309
I think that, you know, the history is the history.

2633
03:20:29,369 --> 03:20:30,270
We all know what we voted for.

2634
03:20:30,550 --> 03:20:33,373
We voted to give the mayor the authority to enter into a contract for 10 years.

2635
03:20:33,434 --> 03:20:34,034
That's what we did.

2636
03:20:34,375 --> 03:20:36,197
And we allowed him to go to the table and negotiate.

2637
03:20:36,537 --> 03:20:39,060
He went to the table, he negotiated, and this is what he came back with.

2638
03:20:39,520 --> 03:20:40,341
We have our concerns.

2639
03:20:40,381 --> 03:20:41,242
We all have our concerns.

2640
03:20:41,262 --> 03:20:45,807
And we've all had individual conversations with the chief and with the people from Republic and with the administration.

2641
03:20:46,167 --> 03:20:57,974
But I think that right now, for the people out there that have concerns and that are scared and that are worried about what's going to happen, we need to tell them what the process is and provide them with an avenue to get answers to have their concerns addressed.

2642
03:20:58,314 --> 03:21:04,357
Because in my experiences so far, I've gotten a number of calls about people that had issues about loading zones, and loading zones have been made.

2643
03:21:05,117 --> 03:21:11,941
The folks from Republic have been pretty reasonable in terms of making accommodations to make this program and plan work for them.

2644
03:21:13,802 --> 03:21:25,329
If we're going to roll out a plan that's going to be successful and that people are going to buy into, we need to look at the future and what avenues we have in order to address problems, not the past and what didn't happen and what should have.

2645
03:21:25,830 --> 03:21:27,611
Thank you, Counselor, for your point of information.

2646
03:21:27,631 --> 03:21:31,013
Counselor Penta has the floor.

2647
03:21:31,133 --> 03:21:35,676
I disagree extremely with Counselor Knight on this because the past is the leader of the future.

2648
03:21:35,916 --> 03:21:38,898
And if you can't learn from the past, the future will never have any value.

2649
03:21:39,429 --> 03:21:40,711
The fact of the matter is this.

2650
03:21:41,091 --> 03:21:42,073
There was no process.

2651
03:21:42,133 --> 03:21:42,914
It never took place.

2652
03:21:43,194 --> 03:21:45,397
And every time you keep saying, well, we have no recourse.

2653
03:21:45,417 --> 03:21:46,078
Let's go forward.

2654
03:21:46,118 --> 03:21:48,141
How can you go forward when you don't even know what took place?

2655
03:21:48,382 --> 03:21:52,187
Because you weren't a part of it, when you were asked to be a part of it, when you were told to be a part of it.

2656
03:21:52,568 --> 03:21:54,791
And you never voted for the finalization of the contract.

2657
03:21:54,991 --> 03:21:56,072
The man took it upon himself.

2658
03:21:58,343 --> 03:22:01,745
The bottom line to this whole thing is that there's a whole bunch of issues here.

2659
03:22:02,065 --> 03:22:04,206
You guys are only here for one reason, that's to make money.

2660
03:22:04,246 --> 03:22:07,688
You're not here to help the city of Medford, you're here to get your salary and to make money.

2661
03:22:07,948 --> 03:22:13,471
So as far as that concern, you should probably sit down because the real questions that need to be asked, the mayor, he's the one that should be here.

2662
03:22:13,711 --> 03:22:16,952
He's the one that should be explaining all of this to the people that's going on.

2663
03:22:18,093 --> 03:22:19,814
So let me ask you something, sir.

2664
03:22:20,694 --> 03:22:23,476
Well, I'm gonna ask him something, he wants to stay there.

2665
03:22:24,438 --> 03:22:25,759
I like him, he's a nice guy.

2666
03:22:26,359 --> 03:22:27,199
Let me ask you something.

2667
03:22:27,379 --> 03:22:27,519
Yes.

2668
03:22:27,939 --> 03:22:30,500
I have pictures here of you people bolting signs to trees.

2669
03:22:30,520 --> 03:22:31,941
Why did you bolt the signs to the trees?

2670
03:22:32,961 --> 03:22:33,821
Were you told to do that?

2671
03:22:34,742 --> 03:22:35,242
No, we were not.

2672
03:22:35,442 --> 03:22:36,482
Did you do it yourself?

2673
03:22:36,502 --> 03:22:43,905
The signs that you see there, you know, what we did is we went along with what we had seen throughout the city, which were signs on trees.

2674
03:22:43,945 --> 03:22:45,766
That's one I think is right out in front of Amici's.

2675
03:22:46,206 --> 03:22:51,528
There was a one hour parking sign that was bolted to that tree that we took down and put back up.

2676
03:22:51,833 --> 03:22:53,294
Well, what about the signs in Haines Square?

2677
03:22:53,875 --> 03:22:54,856
There was nothing on those trees.

2678
03:22:54,976 --> 03:22:55,757
We made a mistake.

2679
03:22:56,357 --> 03:22:58,039
I personally made a mistake because I told the staff.

2680
03:22:58,059 --> 03:23:00,801
Well, didn't the mayor give you any instructions not to bolt signs on trees?

2681
03:23:00,821 --> 03:23:01,702
Did anybody tell you that?

2682
03:23:01,882 --> 03:23:03,043
It's against the ordinance to do that.

2683
03:23:03,824 --> 03:23:05,185
It was my fault for not checking the ordinance.

2684
03:23:05,205 --> 03:23:07,727
No, did anybody tell you if you're going to put the signs up?

2685
03:23:07,747 --> 03:23:09,289
Point of information, Mr. President.

2686
03:23:09,309 --> 03:23:10,570
Point of information, Counselor Camuto.

2687
03:23:10,590 --> 03:23:11,631
Either yes or no.

2688
03:23:11,671 --> 03:23:18,237
Not to throw this gentleman under the bus, but normal person says you don't put the sign on the tree.

2689
03:23:19,768 --> 03:23:22,150
I mean, the guy's acknowledging he made a mistake.

2690
03:23:22,250 --> 03:23:22,951
You want to beat him up?

2691
03:23:22,991 --> 03:23:23,551
Who didn't tell him?

2692
03:23:23,571 --> 03:23:24,372
The chief, the police?

2693
03:23:24,392 --> 03:23:25,513
Yeah, because it's important.

2694
03:23:25,553 --> 03:23:26,854
It's part of what this process is all about.

2695
03:23:26,874 --> 03:23:27,614
I understand, counselor.

2696
03:23:27,795 --> 03:23:29,376
But did you lock your car when you come in tonight?

2697
03:23:29,516 --> 03:23:29,796
Yes, I did.

2698
03:23:29,816 --> 03:23:30,497
Did you lock your car?

2699
03:23:30,637 --> 03:23:31,077
Yes, I did.

2700
03:23:31,357 --> 03:23:35,060
I mean, we're going volley here on ridiculous stuff now.

2701
03:23:35,080 --> 03:23:36,001
Well, that's in your mind.

2702
03:23:36,402 --> 03:23:37,122
No, that's in your mind.

2703
03:23:37,142 --> 03:23:38,964
That's why your mind and mine is entirely different.

2704
03:23:38,984 --> 03:23:39,544
That's correct.

2705
03:23:39,584 --> 03:23:40,004
Thank God.

2706
03:23:40,385 --> 03:23:41,526
I have a pitch, counselor.

2707
03:23:41,826 --> 03:23:42,286
I have a pitch.

2708
03:23:42,306 --> 03:23:43,187
Just answer your question.

2709
03:23:44,658 --> 03:23:49,661
The gentleman did answer the question, and we want to avoid a prosecutorial tone.

2710
03:23:49,681 --> 03:23:51,142
We're not prosecuting anybody.

2711
03:23:51,702 --> 03:23:53,503
Counselor Camuso, point of information.

2712
03:23:53,543 --> 03:23:57,906
To follow up on that, Aggie Tudin was very, very helpful in straightening the situation out.

2713
03:23:58,046 --> 03:24:00,127
So kudos to her.

2714
03:24:00,528 --> 03:24:02,849
I'm not sure if she actually talked to you or someone in your office.

2715
03:24:02,869 --> 03:24:04,690
She's our tree warden here and arborist.

2716
03:24:05,431 --> 03:24:06,491
And she was very concerned.

2717
03:24:08,351 --> 03:24:09,713
She took the bull by the horns on that.

2718
03:24:09,733 --> 03:24:10,954
Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

2719
03:24:13,257 --> 03:24:14,839
Followed by Councilor Caravaglio.

2720
03:24:14,939 --> 03:24:16,542
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2721
03:24:18,164 --> 03:24:21,127
Personally, I don't feel as though Republic should be putting up any signs, Mr. President.

2722
03:24:21,328 --> 03:24:23,651
And the reason so is because that work is DPW work.

2723
03:24:23,691 --> 03:24:25,353
And we have a gentleman in the sign shop.

2724
03:24:25,793 --> 03:24:28,575
who has a job, and his job is to be in charge of the signs.

2725
03:24:28,995 --> 03:24:36,559
So this subletting of work that should be done by the DBW, I feel as though is a problem, Mr. President.

2726
03:24:36,619 --> 03:24:38,319
I think that this work should be handled internally.

2727
03:24:38,359 --> 03:24:44,583
We have a sign shop, we have a gentleman that's in charge of signs, and we have a gentleman who's well versed in the ordinances in the city of Medford.

2728
03:24:44,643 --> 03:24:47,364
Quite frankly, Mr. Nash isn't from Medford, he came to this city.

2729
03:24:48,087 --> 03:24:52,310
and maybe he relied on what he saw or what he's seen in other communities, so be it.

2730
03:24:52,611 --> 03:24:58,435
But we have a sign shop, we have gentlemen in the DPW who know our ordinances, and I think that this is where the work should lie, not outside.

2731
03:24:58,455 --> 03:24:59,856
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2732
03:24:59,916 --> 03:25:00,616
Councilor Pentez.

2733
03:25:00,676 --> 03:25:02,998
In response to Councilor Knight, that's absolutely not true.

2734
03:25:03,018 --> 03:25:08,382
If you read the contract in the IRFP, they made the commitment to put the signs up and to replace the signs that are there.

2735
03:25:08,842 --> 03:25:10,283
That's part of the contract.

2736
03:25:11,284 --> 03:25:12,705
Any information, Councilor Knight?

2737
03:25:14,909 --> 03:25:20,072
The contract that you're referring to is the contract with Republic, but the City of Medford also has a contract.

2738
03:25:20,092 --> 03:25:26,115
The contract is with the Medford DPW Association, represented by Local 25, and they have rights.

2739
03:25:26,535 --> 03:25:34,219
And if they aren't willing to sublet their work, and they haven't had an opportunity to negotiate the impact of the subletting of their work, then there's a violation.

2740
03:25:34,439 --> 03:25:36,841
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

2741
03:25:37,481 --> 03:25:39,842
So are you saying the may is in violation of the contract?

2742
03:25:41,483 --> 03:25:42,324
That's what you just stated.

2743
03:25:43,630 --> 03:25:49,791
that the union contract has been repudiated based upon the fact that outside people- So you're just stating again tonight that the may is in violation of the union contract?

2744
03:25:49,811 --> 03:25:51,052
That's my interpretation, yes.

2745
03:25:51,212 --> 03:25:51,992
That's my interpretation.

2746
03:25:52,052 --> 03:25:53,672
I believe the union contract has been repudiated.

2747
03:25:53,692 --> 03:25:55,912
The DPW workers are suitably employed.

2748
03:25:56,473 --> 03:26:08,175
Counselor Penta has- Yeah, the contract and the IRFP and the three pages of questions that were asked for which you, Republic, indicated that you folks would put up the signs and you would replace- is that true or false?

2749
03:26:08,895 --> 03:26:11,816
That you would replace and put up the signs that were existing.

2750
03:26:12,556 --> 03:26:13,416
That's part of the contract.

2751
03:26:14,100 --> 03:26:16,341
part of the contract was, yes, we were responsible.

2752
03:26:16,381 --> 03:26:17,062
Thank you very much.

2753
03:26:17,242 --> 03:26:17,602
Okay.

2754
03:26:17,862 --> 03:26:18,663
Not the city of Medford.

2755
03:26:19,103 --> 03:26:24,947
Um, we have a, I have a picture here of one of your kiosks in front of Oak Grove cemetery on the sidewalk.

2756
03:26:25,467 --> 03:26:29,490
Can you please explain in the middle of a snowstorm when they go down the street to plow the sidewalk?

2757
03:26:31,268 --> 03:26:32,749
Point of information, Mr. President.

2758
03:26:32,789 --> 03:26:34,750
Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

2759
03:26:34,790 --> 03:26:37,773
That area in particular is maintained by the Cemetery Department.

2760
03:26:38,253 --> 03:26:44,758
And they actually do that whole area, as you probably know, Counselor, from your expertise in that particular area.

2761
03:26:45,198 --> 03:26:48,300
It's done very early in the snowstorms.

2762
03:26:48,901 --> 03:26:51,182
And I'm sure it will continue to be done.

2763
03:26:52,143 --> 03:26:52,844
What expertise?

2764
03:26:52,864 --> 03:26:53,344
You do this?

2765
03:26:53,744 --> 03:26:54,825
You plow the sidewalk, Counselor?

2766
03:26:54,865 --> 03:26:55,105
No, no, no.

2767
03:26:55,145 --> 03:26:58,248
His expertise, he's up in that area a lot, given the nature of his business.

2768
03:26:58,268 --> 03:26:59,909
You do the plowing on the sidewalk, yes or no?

2769
03:27:01,333 --> 03:27:03,615
In front of Oak Grove Cemetery, do you plow the sidewalk there?

2770
03:27:03,655 --> 03:27:04,136
Yes or no?

2771
03:27:04,376 --> 03:27:05,057
You're an expert.

2772
03:27:05,357 --> 03:27:05,838
Yes or no?

2773
03:27:06,198 --> 03:27:07,319
Do I plow the sidewalk?

2774
03:27:07,339 --> 03:27:07,659
Yeah.

2775
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:08,701
Yeah.

2776
03:27:08,861 --> 03:27:10,703
Sure, it'd help if they asked.

2777
03:27:11,523 --> 03:27:13,145
You have one in the middle of the sidewalk there.

2778
03:27:13,225 --> 03:27:16,448
Is there any particular reason why I had to go there and not other places?

2779
03:27:19,311 --> 03:27:20,913
And this spot also has $5 a day parking, so.

2780
03:27:25,299 --> 03:27:26,641
Point of information, Councillor.

2781
03:27:26,661 --> 03:27:31,686
The $5 a day is for out-of-town residents that get on the commuter line or the bus.

2782
03:27:32,957 --> 03:27:40,123
Five dollars a day is a bargain, it's a steal to come to the city of Medford, take the bus, go to Boston, and to park there, five dollars a day.

2783
03:27:40,384 --> 03:27:48,331
But if you have to go down to West Medford, South Medford, North Medford, or Medford Square, you gotta pay to put the money in the quarter, and the most you can do is stay there for two hours.

2784
03:27:48,651 --> 03:27:50,793
So how is that a bargain for the people of Medford?

2785
03:27:51,374 --> 03:27:52,174
It's not a bargain.

2786
03:27:53,696 --> 03:27:58,280
No, I don't, I don't want an out-of-towner coming here for five days when a homegrown person's gonna pay more.

2787
03:28:00,714 --> 03:28:08,496
And I want to applaud you, once again, for acknowledging my fine work in bringing forward the resolution to ban the out-of-towners from parking in Medford.

2788
03:28:08,597 --> 03:28:11,237
And you actually supported it amongst all of us councillors.

2789
03:28:11,477 --> 03:28:13,218
So I thank you for your fine support on that.

2790
03:28:13,458 --> 03:28:14,558
Thank you for your point of information.

2791
03:28:14,598 --> 03:28:16,239
Well, if we're agreeing, what are you yelling at me for?

2792
03:28:16,259 --> 03:28:19,460
Because I love you.

2793
03:28:19,480 --> 03:28:21,961
Councillor Pinto, if we can continue with your line.

2794
03:28:21,981 --> 03:28:29,363
Yeah, also, Dan, I have pictures here and up in West Medford, and I have pictures up here

2795
03:28:30,018 --> 03:28:31,539
On the hillside in Medford.

2796
03:28:32,059 --> 03:28:34,021
You have kiosks in front of residential homes.

2797
03:28:34,061 --> 03:28:34,321
Why?

2798
03:28:36,202 --> 03:28:40,585
The earlier tonight, I know someone that spoke had mentioned a kiosk at 418 High Street.

2799
03:28:40,605 --> 03:28:41,686
That's scheduled to be removed.

2800
03:28:41,766 --> 03:28:42,507
That's going to be gone.

2801
03:28:43,788 --> 03:28:44,888
I'm not sure which one you're speaking of.

2802
03:28:44,908 --> 03:28:46,810
No, this is across the street.

2803
03:28:47,930 --> 03:28:54,735
This is on, these ones here are on Boston Avenue, opposite where Dunkin' Donuts and Nick's Pizza and all that.

2804
03:28:55,215 --> 03:28:56,877
It's all residential on that side of the street.

2805
03:28:57,057 --> 03:28:58,298
You have kiosks up and down the street.

2806
03:28:59,290 --> 03:29:01,491
Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

2807
03:29:01,611 --> 03:29:07,534
That's the exact area that the esteemed young lady, retiree, was talking about.

2808
03:29:07,554 --> 03:29:09,955
That's where the tough students park their vehicles all day long.

2809
03:29:10,115 --> 03:29:10,956
They're out of state plates.

2810
03:29:11,256 --> 03:29:13,017
Maine, Ohio, California.

2811
03:29:13,317 --> 03:29:13,477
No.

2812
03:29:13,617 --> 03:29:19,080
They park their vehicles on the opposite side of the garage, on the opposite side of the garage by the railroad tracks.

2813
03:29:19,140 --> 03:29:19,900
That's where they park.

2814
03:29:20,421 --> 03:29:22,342
Well, anyway.

2815
03:29:23,877 --> 03:29:25,878
You don't put them in front of a residential.

2816
03:29:25,898 --> 03:29:28,180
Then you go up to High Street, opposite St.

2817
03:29:28,200 --> 03:29:31,882
Claude's, there's two residential homes there and there's a kiosk there next to an apartment.

2818
03:29:31,942 --> 03:29:34,364
That's the one I told you, that's scheduled to be removed.

2819
03:29:34,384 --> 03:29:36,425
But why did they go there in the first place?

2820
03:29:36,465 --> 03:29:40,088
All the kiosks were placed based on the walker study that was done.

2821
03:29:40,408 --> 03:29:41,549
Who was this walker study?

2822
03:29:41,569 --> 03:29:43,090
And that was included in the RFP.

2823
03:29:43,690 --> 03:29:45,532
Did the Council get a copy of this walker study?

2824
03:29:46,570 --> 03:29:47,671
You got a copy of the walkers?

2825
03:29:48,191 --> 03:29:48,972
Point of information.

2826
03:29:49,152 --> 03:29:57,018
We actually did not the walker study, but we actually got the overhead projection of every meter and the placement throughout the community at the committee of the whole meeting.

2827
03:29:57,318 --> 03:29:58,219
It's on your disc.

2828
03:29:58,359 --> 03:29:59,120
Yeah, it's on your disc.

2829
03:29:59,900 --> 03:30:06,365
You're going to take the kiosk, the one on Boston Avenue in front of the, in front of all the, that's not my decision.

2830
03:30:07,526 --> 03:30:09,728
Who made the decision to take the ones off of high street?

2831
03:30:10,849 --> 03:30:11,189
The city.

2832
03:30:12,630 --> 03:30:13,511
Was the city here chief?

2833
03:30:13,531 --> 03:30:15,192
Can you get rid of the ones on Boston Ave?

2834
03:30:17,002 --> 03:30:19,183
From the Sacred Heart Church going down on the right-hand side.

2835
03:30:19,283 --> 03:30:27,269
I'd have to look at it only because in some cases they were there because those are out-of-state students that are living in those homes.

2836
03:30:27,289 --> 03:30:28,509
They're not owner-occupied.

2837
03:30:29,410 --> 03:30:30,851
So it is a main drag.

2838
03:30:30,891 --> 03:30:32,832
It does generate a lot of parking activity.

2839
03:30:32,852 --> 03:30:33,232
Well, wait a minute.

2840
03:30:33,252 --> 03:30:34,573
How are you going to make that determination?

2841
03:30:34,613 --> 03:30:37,935
Does an owner-occupied person have to get a sticker so they don't have to pay?

2842
03:30:37,975 --> 03:30:38,836
Sacred Heart Church.

2843
03:30:40,573 --> 03:30:42,595
Are you referring to the Old Sacred Heart Church on Boston Ave?

2844
03:30:42,755 --> 03:30:43,036
Yes.

2845
03:30:43,476 --> 03:30:43,857
Oh, okay.

2846
03:30:43,917 --> 03:30:46,580
I'm confused because that's now Tufts University.

2847
03:30:47,261 --> 03:30:50,624
The Old Sacred Heart Church chief on that side going all the way down.

2848
03:30:51,285 --> 03:30:52,707
There are apartments.

2849
03:30:53,147 --> 03:30:56,231
There's only actually a few houses between Bellevue.

2850
03:30:57,067 --> 03:30:58,607
Fairmont and University.

2851
03:30:59,027 --> 03:31:00,808
You have two parking, you have two kiosks there.

2852
03:31:00,888 --> 03:31:07,869
I have to look to see if they can be utilized in a better spot, but I know from University Avenue down to College Avenue will be needed.

2853
03:31:08,109 --> 03:31:23,413
But you have two kiosks there, so if you're worried about students who aren't owner-occupiers, then why can't you give them stickers like you want to maybe give to the seniors so that way they can be identified and they can park there and they don't have to worry about going to a kiosk and putting in a meter.

2854
03:31:23,893 --> 03:31:25,113
Which seniors are you talking about?

2855
03:31:28,133 --> 03:31:30,855
As I said earlier, I have to look at the location and see what the situation is.

2856
03:31:31,075 --> 03:31:31,936
What is he talking about, this guy?

2857
03:31:31,956 --> 03:31:32,937
Why don't you listen to what I'm saying?

2858
03:31:32,957 --> 03:31:33,457
You said the seniors.

2859
03:31:33,477 --> 03:31:34,698
I said like the seniors, like he wants to give the seniors.

2860
03:31:34,718 --> 03:31:36,459
You're talking about the old Sacred Heart Church.

2861
03:31:36,519 --> 03:31:36,820
Forget it.

2862
03:31:36,840 --> 03:31:37,420
Jesus.

2863
03:31:37,500 --> 03:31:38,761
Also, you're losing it.

2864
03:31:39,542 --> 03:31:39,982
You have?

2865
03:31:41,123 --> 03:31:42,784
Counselor Penter, if I could suggest.

2866
03:31:42,864 --> 03:31:43,104
Yeah.

2867
03:31:43,144 --> 03:31:45,826
We've spoken at a rather lengthy time.

2868
03:31:46,026 --> 03:31:47,307
Wait a minute, this is very important.

2869
03:31:47,608 --> 03:31:48,108
You have kiosks.

2870
03:31:48,128 --> 03:31:50,510
How are you going to identify these kiosks at night when it's dark out?

2871
03:31:52,151 --> 03:31:52,751
There's no signage.

2872
03:31:52,772 --> 03:31:52,992
Flashlight.

2873
03:31:53,012 --> 03:31:53,632
There's no lights.

2874
03:31:53,672 --> 03:31:54,173
There's nothing.

2875
03:31:55,049 --> 03:32:09,921
So if somebody's coming into the square, somebody wants to park in this parking lot at the end of the ring road, how are they going to see these two little kiosks in the back of the building that aren't lit up at all, and the people have a huge 150 car parking lot without anything in it?

2876
03:32:10,982 --> 03:32:11,742
How are we going to do that?

2877
03:32:11,922 --> 03:32:17,687
I mean, how is that equity compared to a small little businessman who's got a sign in front of a store or a kiosk?

2878
03:32:19,022 --> 03:32:21,063
Just keep in mind, 7 p.m.

2879
03:32:21,083 --> 03:32:24,085
is the cutoff, so I know what you're saying, 4 o'clock, it's dark out.

2880
03:32:24,145 --> 03:32:24,886
I understand that.

2881
03:32:25,746 --> 03:32:27,287
So how do you do this?

2882
03:32:27,307 --> 03:32:29,129
These things don't even get illuminated.

2883
03:32:29,149 --> 03:32:36,293
So if somebody decides to come to the square, and they're four or five spaces away from a kiosk, what are they going to do?

2884
03:32:36,494 --> 03:32:38,435
Are they going to get out of the car and go looking for a kiosk?

2885
03:32:40,342 --> 03:32:41,602
It's not illuminated.

2886
03:32:41,642 --> 03:32:44,763
At that hour, they're probably not going to park in that parking lot.

2887
03:32:44,803 --> 03:32:45,923
I don't care about this parking lot.

2888
03:32:45,943 --> 03:32:47,624
This is just an example of one spot.

2889
03:32:47,904 --> 03:32:48,784
Take the other spots.

2890
03:32:48,984 --> 03:32:50,184
You have a small little peak.

2891
03:32:51,224 --> 03:32:53,565
There's no light in the top that goes along or anything.

2892
03:32:53,585 --> 03:32:55,985
You said the thing is run by solar.

2893
03:32:56,025 --> 03:32:57,806
I'm assuming it has a battery backup.

2894
03:32:57,846 --> 03:33:00,846
Why can't you have some kind of a light on it?

2895
03:33:01,086 --> 03:33:03,707
So people don't feel like they're getting sucked in if they get a ticket.

2896
03:33:06,036 --> 03:33:13,541
But I also think that, as was stated earlier, we have to give people a little more credit than what's being given right now.

2897
03:33:13,621 --> 03:33:26,410
How long do you think it's going to take, Chief, the people of this city of Medford who don't watch the council meetings, don't have a computer, or don't utilize it, don't read the newspaper, to get themselves acclimated before they start getting tickets all over the place?

2898
03:33:28,692 --> 03:33:29,012
How long?

2899
03:33:29,112 --> 03:33:30,893
I think the learning process will be very quick.

2900
03:33:32,074 --> 03:33:35,056
Well, if the learning process is quick, maybe the revenues will be down.

2901
03:33:35,466 --> 03:33:39,088
And if the revenues are down, that's gonna mean businesses are in trouble because people aren't gonna do it.

2902
03:33:39,268 --> 03:33:44,130
You know, we could have been the only community around that did not have paid parking.

2903
03:33:44,270 --> 03:33:45,970
You know what that would have meant for business people?

2904
03:33:46,290 --> 03:33:48,451
And you know what that would have done to the climate of this community?

2905
03:33:48,732 --> 03:33:53,073
Just have enforcement for the hours that are there, whether it's a half hour or an hour or whatever it might be.

2906
03:33:53,574 --> 03:33:54,634
You could have a self-medfit.

2907
03:33:54,854 --> 03:33:59,956
You have 15 minute, you have a half hour, you have one hour and two hour parking on blocks of stores.

2908
03:34:00,236 --> 03:34:01,637
How does that make any sense?

2909
03:34:03,509 --> 03:34:05,490
I mean, how did they get to these numbers?

2910
03:34:05,851 --> 03:34:10,914
One business has 15 minutes, another one has free parking for a half hour, another one's got a half hour, another one's got an hour.

2911
03:34:11,094 --> 03:34:14,617
But that goes back to what I said earlier, making exemptions as we go along.

2912
03:34:14,637 --> 03:34:16,939
It's like we can't cater to every whim.

2913
03:34:17,459 --> 03:34:17,819
But Chief.

2914
03:34:17,839 --> 03:34:18,560
And that's what happened.

2915
03:34:18,580 --> 03:34:20,741
That's why you see the inconsistent timelines.

2916
03:34:21,362 --> 03:34:27,766
You've exceeded your time limit rather abundantly, and perhaps it would be.

2917
03:34:27,966 --> 03:34:29,748
It's a very important issue, as you know.

2918
03:34:30,028 --> 03:34:30,548
I know that.

2919
03:34:31,209 --> 03:34:32,850
You've become rather repetitive

2920
03:34:33,366 --> 03:34:35,207
I don't think so.

2921
03:34:35,967 --> 03:34:38,588
In Medford square, how many actual spots are there?

2922
03:34:39,329 --> 03:34:45,652
Because the Councillor was on when they built the garage that actually fell apart and got destroyed.

2923
03:34:46,496 --> 03:34:48,877
I don't know if it was shoddy construction back then or what the deal was.

2924
03:34:48,917 --> 03:34:50,777
But how many spots are actually in Medford Square now?

2925
03:34:50,797 --> 03:34:52,097
I didn't build that garage.

2926
03:34:52,197 --> 03:34:53,778
Oh, you were on the council when you approved that garage.

2927
03:34:53,798 --> 03:34:56,298
It was your friend, the mayor, that didn't help the poor guy that fell through the roof.

2928
03:34:56,318 --> 03:34:57,259
No, it was built before he.

2929
03:34:57,279 --> 03:34:59,019
The poor guy that fell through the roof that worked at the city.

2930
03:34:59,059 --> 03:34:59,419
That's right.

2931
03:34:59,439 --> 03:35:00,999
The mayor never went once to see him.

2932
03:35:01,099 --> 03:35:01,880
You built the garage.

2933
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:02,780
Never went to see him.

2934
03:35:02,980 --> 03:35:03,640
Go ahead.

2935
03:35:03,960 --> 03:35:07,241
As far as the total number of spots, it's lucky he's alive.

2936
03:35:07,681 --> 03:35:08,081
I'm sorry.

2937
03:35:08,461 --> 03:35:10,562
As far as the total number of spots, I don't know the exact number.

2938
03:35:10,582 --> 03:35:12,342
I know there's 36 kiosks and what.

2939
03:35:12,542 --> 03:35:14,903
Can you let the chief know the number tomorrow and I'll be in touch with him?

2940
03:35:15,483 --> 03:35:15,863
Absolutely.

2941
03:35:16,513 --> 03:35:17,013
Thank you.

2942
03:35:19,434 --> 03:35:22,855
Councillor Penter, if you could wrap it up, please.

2943
03:35:23,255 --> 03:35:36,219
I'd like to move that we keep this in a full-blown committee on behalf of the taxpayers of this community for the purposes of having a... There is no paper to keep on the floor.

2944
03:35:36,419 --> 03:35:37,560
We'll make a paper on the floor.

2945
03:35:37,620 --> 03:35:38,760
Make this the paper on the floor.

2946
03:35:39,440 --> 03:35:41,881
Point of information, Councillor Camuso.

2947
03:35:42,241 --> 03:35:44,102
I'll yield to the gentleman, but...

2948
03:35:45,278 --> 03:35:46,418
His motion is redundant.

2949
03:35:46,498 --> 03:35:50,519
Councilor Vice-President, I'm sorry, Councilor Caravaglio already has that.

2950
03:35:50,539 --> 03:35:50,799
60 days.

2951
03:35:50,999 --> 03:35:51,479
What's he want?

2952
03:35:51,499 --> 03:35:51,979
I didn't hear him.

2953
03:35:52,019 --> 03:35:53,219
What did you say, Rick?

2954
03:35:53,299 --> 03:35:53,720
I'm sorry.

2955
03:35:53,780 --> 03:35:57,700
I think two or three weeks ago, we asked for 60 days, if they would come back.

2956
03:35:57,720 --> 03:35:59,000
Well, I don't want to wait 60 days.

2957
03:35:59,040 --> 03:36:01,621
I just want to leave it open, so in case we have another opportunity.

2958
03:36:01,681 --> 03:36:04,001
We have to give them some time to get it done.

2959
03:36:04,321 --> 03:36:06,202
Well, we can talk about what took place here tonight.

2960
03:36:06,222 --> 03:36:07,742
There is no paper before us.

2961
03:36:07,902 --> 03:36:08,542
Well, then we move.

2962
03:36:08,682 --> 03:36:09,142
Move the paper.

2963
03:36:09,222 --> 03:36:10,163
Move the conversation.

2964
03:36:10,183 --> 03:36:11,123
Can't come up for 90 days.

2965
03:36:11,163 --> 03:36:12,343
You can move the conversation.

2966
03:36:12,943 --> 03:36:14,244
I'm going to beat you with the rules, Councillor.

2967
03:36:14,404 --> 03:36:16,044
Point of information, Councillor Knight.

2968
03:36:16,064 --> 03:36:16,825
It's going to be a long year.

2969
03:36:16,845 --> 03:36:25,148
If I may be so bold to suggest, please do, that if certain individuals want a paper, they file a resolution.

2970
03:36:25,428 --> 03:36:26,709
And we can talk about it next week.

2971
03:36:26,729 --> 03:36:29,930
Well, then perhaps we'll wrap up this discussion now.

2972
03:36:30,511 --> 03:36:35,253
And we'll invite one of our beloved colleagues to submit a proper paper.

2973
03:36:35,273 --> 03:36:36,293
What about the gentleman?

2974
03:36:36,693 --> 03:36:39,374
Councillor Caraviello has been waiting patiently.

2975
03:36:42,177 --> 03:36:42,537
Was it Dan?

2976
03:36:42,577 --> 03:36:44,358
Yes, sir.

2977
03:36:44,378 --> 03:36:44,898
I have a question for you.

2978
03:36:45,979 --> 03:36:50,321
When Counselor Penta was asking you about the appeal process.

2979
03:36:51,262 --> 03:36:52,482
Yes, I have.

2980
03:36:52,542 --> 03:36:53,703
Maybe I didn't hear you correctly.

2981
03:36:55,104 --> 03:36:59,886
Did you say that if there's an overabundance of appeals, that you can step in and?

2982
03:36:59,906 --> 03:37:01,867
Yes, sir, yeah.

2983
03:37:02,407 --> 03:37:02,988
You can do that?

2984
03:37:03,188 --> 03:37:03,328
Yes.

2985
03:37:04,978 --> 03:37:07,239
You said you'd recommend it.

2986
03:37:07,299 --> 03:37:10,602
You said you'd be able to, if there's an overabundance of appeals, we could do that.

2987
03:37:10,862 --> 03:37:12,663
You would step in and take over the process?

2988
03:37:13,724 --> 03:37:15,205
We would help supplement the process.

2989
03:37:15,325 --> 03:37:27,773
I still think it's important that there's an appeal, that they can go to an appeal process that appears to be outside of our office, because when they come to our office to appeal, and if it gets denied, then they can be, well, they wrote the ticket and they, even though it would be independent.

2990
03:37:27,813 --> 03:37:30,155
What would you consider an overabundance, what percentage?

2991
03:37:33,668 --> 03:37:34,868
I don't want to throw a number at that.

2992
03:37:34,929 --> 03:37:40,352
If 50% of the tickets are overturned, you would step in and say, I'm going to bring my own guy to do this?

2993
03:37:40,992 --> 03:37:46,616
Well, I think it wouldn't be based on how many are overturned as opposed to how many are actually appealed.

2994
03:37:46,736 --> 03:37:47,517
Actually being appealed?

2995
03:37:47,937 --> 03:37:48,177
Right.

2996
03:37:49,038 --> 03:37:54,962
So I say at some point, you could step in and take the process away from us, if that's what I understood.

2997
03:37:56,056 --> 03:37:58,018
I think point of information.

2998
03:38:00,221 --> 03:38:03,285
As much as a council, I think we want to take it out of city hall.

2999
03:38:03,826 --> 03:38:07,390
I'm not going to put it back in their hands where they're right on the ticket.

3000
03:38:07,570 --> 03:38:12,536
If there's a conflict of interest on the city hall side, there's a conflict of interest on the vendor that's making money.

3001
03:38:16,512 --> 03:38:17,072
I agree.

3002
03:38:17,233 --> 03:38:21,655
Now, because I think it's more of an appearance issue because we wouldn't actually adjudicate.

3003
03:38:22,276 --> 03:38:26,038
People will be saying you're only upholding the ticket because it's right.

3004
03:38:26,058 --> 03:38:27,559
So I think there needs to be going in your pocket.

3005
03:38:27,659 --> 03:38:31,321
There needs to be a, a step beyond us.

3006
03:38:33,063 --> 03:38:34,884
I wasn't sure when you said that, but here's your right.

3007
03:38:38,010 --> 03:38:46,397
We would have the ability and willingness to help supplement the appeal process to try to alleviate appeals that have to go to City Hall.

3008
03:38:46,417 --> 03:38:55,644
I would not recommend not allowing that process to still be there for appearance's sake to make sure people feel they're getting a fair shake on that.

3009
03:39:01,948 --> 03:39:02,149
Thank you.

3010
03:39:02,529 --> 03:39:02,909
Thank you.

3011
03:39:03,229 --> 03:39:03,490
Thank you.

3012
03:39:07,006 --> 03:39:08,807
Thank you for that.

3013
03:39:10,088 --> 03:39:10,488
Quick question.

3014
03:39:10,528 --> 03:39:14,111
I want to go back to what Adam brought up about loading zones and deliveries.

3015
03:39:14,471 --> 03:39:15,271
Councilor Knight.

3016
03:39:16,012 --> 03:39:16,972
Councilor Knight, yes.

3017
03:39:20,335 --> 03:39:36,185
A major part of deliveries in all these business districts, West Medford, Haines Square, Medford Square, all the areas that now have kiosks in them, which are the business districts,

3018
03:39:38,363 --> 03:39:40,064
90% of us depend on deliveries.

3019
03:39:41,845 --> 03:39:43,207
There's never any parking.

3020
03:39:43,227 --> 03:39:44,368
We don't have any loading zones.

3021
03:39:44,428 --> 03:39:47,330
I brought this up at one of our meetings, I think, Leo, correct?

3022
03:39:47,991 --> 03:39:52,534
And Chief Stack, I guess I have to refer you to since Little League Baseball.

3023
03:39:52,815 --> 03:39:57,158
Anyway, what's going to happen to these?

3024
03:39:57,218 --> 03:40:03,424
Are we going to end up as a business owner with a surcharge from these companies that are getting whacked with tickets and so forth?

3025
03:40:03,444 --> 03:40:06,086
Because they double park, triple park, they park everywhere.

3026
03:40:07,300 --> 03:40:08,400
We've all come across it.

3027
03:40:08,441 --> 03:40:12,722
This isn't the first time it's ever come up.

3028
03:40:13,283 --> 03:40:15,264
Who's patrolling that and how that's going to go.

3029
03:40:18,405 --> 03:40:24,168
It's an enforcement issue that maybe the chief can take a stab at it.

3030
03:40:24,208 --> 03:40:30,070
But I know that the last time we talked about this, I mean, the idea is that, you know, we know the businesses have to have their deliveries.

3031
03:40:30,470 --> 03:40:33,172
We're going to try not to interfere with them.

3032
03:40:33,912 --> 03:40:36,093
I do have an issue when they double pack on Salem street,

3033
03:40:36,669 --> 03:40:41,192
because I see collisions happening, because people have to swerve into another lane.

3034
03:40:43,233 --> 03:40:49,797
But I have not received numerous complaints about the loading trucks, and I don't anticipate that they would be ticketed.

3035
03:40:50,677 --> 03:40:54,860
There was a location that I thought we could do something, maybe on River Street.

3036
03:40:55,861 --> 03:40:58,102
Probably can't, because the buses have to make the turn there.

3037
03:40:58,142 --> 03:41:06,407
But we're certainly not going to interfere with the loading and deliveries, unless someone's abusing it, and they're going to be there for an hour.

3038
03:41:06,920 --> 03:41:16,104
I have great respect for the, the, the, the men and women who drive the tractor trailers and make these deliveries, how they can get in and out of tight spots and how quickly they can make their deliveries.

3039
03:41:16,364 --> 03:41:23,308
Uh, so the hope is, and I know you do, and I understand what you're saying, but we've entered a different phase here now.

3040
03:41:24,228 --> 03:41:25,769
This is out of your control.

3041
03:41:25,889 --> 03:41:27,810
It's not totally out of the police department's control.

3042
03:41:27,830 --> 03:41:32,792
We have a different company coming in here who's now the enforcement company, who's the writing agent.

3043
03:41:33,872 --> 03:41:38,375
Well, they're enforcing the time, the time limits.

3044
03:41:38,895 --> 03:41:52,245
If I can just point out from the chair that it was quite explicit in the contract that the enforcement of the parking and traffic regulations of the city of Medford, uh, the purview of Metro police department.

3045
03:41:52,305 --> 03:41:52,465
Well,

3046
03:41:56,808 --> 03:42:00,690
The goal is that they will be following our direction on something like loading trucks.

3047
03:42:00,750 --> 03:42:10,395
A big 18 wheel pulls into a bus stop like they do all the time and delivering 20 barrels to the liquor store next to me and 10 barrels to me.

3048
03:42:11,055 --> 03:42:15,657
With these guys swooping in because this is how they make their income.

3049
03:42:16,338 --> 03:42:22,281
They're going to be writing them up and then now we're going to be forced to have set delivery times and everything.

3050
03:42:22,701 --> 03:42:26,583
Well, I mean, that would be great if we could have set delivery times, but we know that they can't.

3051
03:42:26,884 --> 03:42:32,547
Maybe that's a better conversation to be had between you and the chief rather than in a public venue.

3052
03:42:33,388 --> 03:42:33,808
Thank you.

3053
03:42:35,229 --> 03:42:47,276
I thought this is a public venue for business in general, and this is a forum to see how the chairman of Congress did such a bad job at doing this.

3054
03:42:51,317 --> 03:42:54,698
The business owners, this is a concern for deliverance.

3055
03:42:56,419 --> 03:42:57,099
We understand.

3056
03:43:01,161 --> 03:43:04,242
I think the question is pertinent, because you just mentioned Salem Street.

3057
03:43:04,722 --> 03:43:09,544
And if Salem Street, which is a smaller, maybe in width of a street, as compared to other locations.

3058
03:43:09,564 --> 03:43:13,146
But every one of these businesses, at some point in time, has to have some kind of delivery.

3059
03:43:13,786 --> 03:43:14,427
Right.

3060
03:43:15,447 --> 03:43:17,808
So what I don't understand is,

3061
03:43:19,587 --> 03:43:25,513
Why should these republic people even be giving those businesses citation?

3062
03:43:27,334 --> 03:43:28,756
I mean, I think that's what Mr. Carroll is asking.

3063
03:43:28,776 --> 03:43:30,057
Why should they be giving citations?

3064
03:43:30,077 --> 03:43:34,381
Yeah, if you're saying the other ones is going to, all they're going to be doing is giving, what, tickets?

3065
03:43:35,402 --> 03:43:36,383
Just the tickets for the time?

3066
03:43:36,543 --> 03:43:39,346
Why would they be giving a ticket to someone who might be making a delivery?

3067
03:43:39,406 --> 03:43:40,126
That's what the question is.

3068
03:43:40,146 --> 03:43:41,748
I don't anticipate that that will happen.

3069
03:43:42,469 --> 03:43:42,669
Oh, OK.

3070
03:43:43,168 --> 03:43:43,468
You don't?

3071
03:43:43,748 --> 03:43:43,888
No.

3072
03:43:44,189 --> 03:43:44,449
OK.

3073
03:43:44,869 --> 03:43:46,570
There was no desire to have a disruption of business.

3074
03:43:46,590 --> 03:43:51,393
All I can say is you'll probably find a police officer giving that ticket if that truck's there for two hours.

3075
03:43:51,553 --> 03:43:51,793
OK.

3076
03:43:52,294 --> 03:43:55,275
I mean, like I said, a lot of these deliveries are done very quickly.

3077
03:43:55,315 --> 03:43:56,716
And the last part of the question is this.

3078
03:43:56,776 --> 03:44:00,759
If I get a ticket and I have it appealed and I lose my appeal, can I take this to district court?

3079
03:44:01,579 --> 03:44:02,460
Where does this appeal go?

3080
03:44:03,060 --> 03:44:04,721
You have the option.

3081
03:44:04,741 --> 03:44:08,263
What's the next logical, what's the next process after that if you lose your appeal?

3082
03:44:09,004 --> 03:44:09,204
Court.

3083
03:44:09,844 --> 03:44:10,525
Is it district court?

3084
03:44:10,545 --> 03:44:10,985
I believe it is.

3085
03:44:13,913 --> 03:44:16,155
So I have one question for the chair to the chief.

3086
03:44:16,635 --> 03:44:17,015
Please.

3087
03:44:18,356 --> 03:44:18,557
Yes.

3088
03:44:18,577 --> 03:44:24,901
If a vehicle is illegally parked, the public cannot give them the citation.

3089
03:44:26,743 --> 03:44:29,945
No, if a vehicle is illegally parked, they can't give the citation.

3090
03:44:30,225 --> 03:44:31,466
It's part of the enforcement.

3091
03:44:31,506 --> 03:44:37,871
So if it's a delivery vehicle parked in a bus stop, which I think is illegal, that's pretty defiant, too.

3092
03:44:38,011 --> 03:44:38,832
$100, set by the MBTA.

3093
03:44:42,869 --> 03:44:45,431
Is the Republican that ticket, or do we have to wait for the Metro Police?

3094
03:44:45,751 --> 03:44:46,532
Point of information, Chief.

3095
03:44:47,052 --> 03:44:48,953
Point of information, Councilor Caravaglio.

3096
03:44:49,654 --> 03:44:55,258
The Republican people are telling them they will not be tagging in the bus stops.

3097
03:44:55,318 --> 03:44:56,159
It's a tease problem.

3098
03:44:57,059 --> 03:44:58,160
No, they can tag.

3099
03:44:58,560 --> 03:45:02,163
That's what they've been telling the businesses in the square.

3100
03:45:02,563 --> 03:45:03,824
We're not going to tag you in the bus.

3101
03:45:04,145 --> 03:45:05,666
That's what the ambassadors were saying in the square.

3102
03:45:06,748 --> 03:45:07,569
They misspoke.

3103
03:45:07,649 --> 03:45:13,972
I've spoken to as many businesses as I can and we would tag in a bus stop if someone was parked illegally.

3104
03:45:14,072 --> 03:45:14,513
Absolutely.

3105
03:45:14,733 --> 03:45:16,214
You should make that known to your ambassadors.

3106
03:45:17,274 --> 03:45:17,815
I will let them know.

3107
03:45:17,835 --> 03:45:18,555
They're here to help out.

3108
03:45:18,975 --> 03:45:22,417
Their primary goal this week is to help educate people on the kiosks.

3109
03:45:22,497 --> 03:45:24,078
It's been like three degrees out there.

3110
03:45:24,158 --> 03:45:27,040
It's kind of a bad week to get them out there this week.

3111
03:45:27,180 --> 03:45:31,482
Yeah, the parking ambassadors' primary goal this week has been to help train people on the kiosks and assist them with that.

3112
03:45:31,542 --> 03:45:33,484
They're not familiar with the ordinances.

3113
03:45:34,901 --> 03:45:40,405
And I'll clarify to them to not answer questions on enforcement procedures because they're not our enforcement staff.

3114
03:45:41,106 --> 03:45:42,407
What if a car, wait a minute, strike that.

3115
03:45:42,427 --> 03:45:48,171
What if a car is illegally parked and the delivery has to be made, which forces the delivery truck to go up in the street?

3116
03:45:48,671 --> 03:45:50,973
Does that mean the delivery truck is now going to get the ticket?

3117
03:45:54,174 --> 03:45:58,175
I mean, if the vehicle is double parked, then they would be in violation of an ordinance.

3118
03:45:58,215 --> 03:46:07,478
No, if the vehicle, the delivery truck could not make his delivery because the car that was parked where the delivery truck was going to go is illegally parked or over parked.

3119
03:46:07,758 --> 03:46:09,419
So that forces the truck out into the street.

3120
03:46:09,859 --> 03:46:13,580
Does that truck going to get a ticket because of that car that's illegally parked?

3121
03:46:14,220 --> 03:46:14,600
Yes.

3122
03:46:14,720 --> 03:46:16,261
And what I'd say to add to that is,

3123
03:46:17,340 --> 03:46:20,962
We're not doing our job if there's a car sitting in that loading zone that prevents a delivery truck.

3124
03:46:20,982 --> 03:46:22,603
Yeah, but you only have two people to go around the city.

3125
03:46:23,604 --> 03:46:25,065
You can't be at every place all at once.

3126
03:46:25,085 --> 03:46:25,845
That's impossible.

3127
03:46:28,947 --> 03:46:29,828
Thank you, Counselor.

3128
03:46:30,228 --> 03:46:37,752
I understand your question, and I respectfully disagree that we can actually effectively enforce the loading zones without having to be in the square at all times.

3129
03:46:38,313 --> 03:46:42,735
And that's by doing proper enforcement throughout the city and tagging those people that do the violations.

3130
03:46:42,976 --> 03:46:44,737
So, yes.

3131
03:46:46,616 --> 03:46:49,077
And we would take consideration into a situation like that.

3132
03:46:49,117 --> 03:46:59,162
If we approach that, our enforcement officer would go into the business and try to identify what's going on, ask the delivery driver to move, if possible, and give them the benefit of the doubt.

3133
03:47:02,824 --> 03:47:11,509
So when the rubbish truck goes down the street and parks in the middle of the street because there's cars parked on the right, and they're collecting the rubbish off the sidewalk, they will or they won't get a ticket, the rubbish trucks?

3134
03:47:12,990 --> 03:47:14,811
We're not going to ticket any rubbish trucks.

3135
03:47:16,613 --> 03:47:25,396
And, uh, uh, councilman Camuso to answer previous questions so we can avoid a phone call.

3136
03:47:25,416 --> 03:47:28,798
There's just under 600 spaces in Metro square, just under.

3137
03:47:31,459 --> 03:47:32,639
Yep.

3138
03:47:32,819 --> 03:47:34,340
Just, just to finish up on that.

3139
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:41,883
My recommendation is that the delivery truck, unless they're abusing the opportunity will not be tagged for the violation.

3140
03:47:43,243 --> 03:47:47,625
I mean, until we can sit down and designate loading zones, but we just don't have enough geography.

3141
03:47:47,645 --> 03:47:52,686
If we're trying to create parking spaces for consumers, we'd be taking it away from them.

3142
03:47:52,786 --> 03:47:58,888
So if we can accommodate them on the street and if they have to double park and it's temporary, we can work with them.

3143
03:48:00,268 --> 03:48:06,530
Thank you very much for all your help tonight, Chief, and thank you to the representatives of Republican Parking.

3144
03:48:08,291 --> 03:48:08,571
Ma'am?

3145
03:48:09,951 --> 03:48:10,312
Ma'am?

3146
03:48:11,112 --> 03:48:11,692
Very briefly.

3147
03:48:12,712 --> 03:48:20,078
I just want to say is, it seems to me, I called my house to find out if people were watching this.

3148
03:48:20,899 --> 03:48:24,101
And what I was told is they don't know any more now than they knew before.

3149
03:48:25,623 --> 03:48:32,128
And so what I am suggesting, and Mr. President, are you listening?

3150
03:48:32,949 --> 03:48:35,351
Okay, I just want to make sure.

3151
03:48:35,531 --> 03:48:40,335
What I am suggesting, just from what you've heard here tonight,

3152
03:48:41,848 --> 03:49:04,414
Is it possible, because all those folks that are out there listening, looking at television and hearing all of this, and they don't know anymore than they knew before, is it possible for the city council to have, or would it make sense, because I thought I heard this man saying, in a year, if things weren't going, or whatever, that they could cancel,

3153
03:49:05,560 --> 03:49:21,850
or whatever, is it possible for you to do or the chief to have a robo-call, one of those 411 calls, have a public meeting here, get the call out there?

3154
03:49:21,870 --> 03:49:24,052
I get them all the time for everything.

3155
03:49:24,172 --> 03:49:32,637
So have a public meeting and let all the people come here with their questions because I'm sure that

3156
03:49:36,933 --> 03:49:37,333
For what?

3157
03:49:40,134 --> 03:49:40,274
And?

3158
03:49:47,377 --> 03:49:47,578
And?

3159
03:49:58,162 --> 03:50:04,825
So you're saying that you can't have a public meeting unless the mayor gives permission to do that.

3160
03:50:07,378 --> 03:50:08,318
That's what it sounds like.

3161
03:50:11,019 --> 03:50:12,020
I understand that.

3162
03:50:14,261 --> 03:50:18,182
We have how many citizens here in Medford?

3163
03:50:18,723 --> 03:50:21,464
They don't understand what is going on because

3164
03:50:23,003 --> 03:50:28,029
The cart is before the horse.

3165
03:50:28,649 --> 03:50:36,239
This should have been the kind of meeting that should have been held with these people to come and explain everything.

3166
03:50:36,639 --> 03:50:38,701
We don't even have anything in writing.

3167
03:50:39,022 --> 03:50:40,163
We don't have anything in print.

3168
03:50:40,243 --> 03:50:41,044
I have no idea.

3169
03:50:41,785 --> 03:50:46,827
what this program is all about except that I know that these kiosks are on the street.

3170
03:50:47,567 --> 03:50:59,071
And it just seems to me, and Councilor Knight, I know you're new, I know you're young, but you gotta know where you're coming from to know where you're going.

3171
03:50:59,171 --> 03:51:00,512
So to think that you

3172
03:51:01,500 --> 03:51:03,322
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

3173
03:51:03,422 --> 03:51:07,745
I would certainly agree that history is important, but history is history, and it's time for us to move on now.

3174
03:51:07,765 --> 03:51:08,226
No, no, no.

3175
03:51:08,246 --> 03:51:09,547
We need to know the history, though.

3176
03:51:09,567 --> 03:51:10,468
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3177
03:51:10,488 --> 03:51:11,849
We always need to know the history.

3178
03:51:11,889 --> 03:51:12,710
Oh, and I knew the history.

3179
03:51:12,770 --> 03:51:13,711
I was involved from day one.

3180
03:51:13,871 --> 03:51:15,492
Thank you.

3181
03:51:16,033 --> 03:51:17,714
So you're saying that's not possible.

3182
03:51:17,734 --> 03:51:18,535
Is that what you're saying?

3183
03:51:18,575 --> 03:51:19,456
You can't do that?

3184
03:51:19,836 --> 03:51:20,837
I'm not saying that.

3185
03:51:21,137 --> 03:51:25,301
And the council is going to receive further resolutions for next week.

3186
03:51:25,321 --> 03:51:26,902
I'll put it on next week.

3187
03:51:26,922 --> 03:51:27,222
Good.

3188
03:51:27,523 --> 03:51:28,744
Thank you, Councilor Pinter.

3189
03:51:33,218 --> 03:51:36,079
Thank you, that will conclude this discussion tonight.

3190
03:51:36,860 --> 03:51:41,582
The records tabled December 16th.

3191
03:51:45,463 --> 03:51:49,045
We have one paper on the hand of the clerk received under suspension.

3192
03:51:50,466 --> 03:52:02,231
Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Metro City Council adjourn in memory of the late Governor's Counselor, Michael J. Callahan, fourth anniversary of his death.

3193
03:52:02,807 --> 03:52:05,412
Fourth anniversary of his death.

3194
03:52:05,572 --> 03:52:06,935
Mr. President, thank you very much.

3195
03:52:07,416 --> 03:52:09,881
As many of you are aware, Michael Callahan and I were dear friends.

3196
03:52:10,482 --> 03:52:13,127
And four years ago this evening, he passed away.

3197
03:52:14,095 --> 03:52:20,657
Michael Callahan was a public servant for 48 years working in the federal and state and local government.

3198
03:52:21,257 --> 03:52:25,599
He was the consumer commissioner for the Medford Consumer Commission from 1978 until his passing.

3199
03:52:25,939 --> 03:52:31,881
He was a four-term governor's counselor, and he was also chief steward at the National Association of Government Employees.

3200
03:52:32,561 --> 03:52:37,243
Michael is sorely and sadly missed, Mr. President, just this past year.

3201
03:52:37,923 --> 03:52:40,324
He was honored up at Wrights Pond for his work

3202
03:52:40,754 --> 03:52:46,378
in protecting Wrights Pond and ensuring that that location was not turned into condominium complexes in the early to late 80s.

3203
03:52:46,999 --> 03:52:54,985
So, Mr. President, I think it's fitting that on this evening and this anniversary of the death of such a great man that the City Council adjourns in his memory.

3204
03:52:56,186 --> 03:52:59,068
I sat on his knee when he was dressed as Santa Claus.

3205
03:53:01,169 --> 03:53:01,810
The records.

3206
03:53:02,571 --> 03:53:03,611
Yes, Councillor Penta.

3207
03:53:04,592 --> 03:53:04,952
Please.

3208
03:53:06,233 --> 03:53:06,514
Chief.

3209
03:53:08,175 --> 03:53:08,375
Chief.

3210
03:53:09,145 --> 03:53:11,807
We chief question.

3211
03:53:13,048 --> 03:53:13,749
Can you go back?

3212
03:53:14,329 --> 03:53:16,010
I wish the guy from Republic was still here.

3213
03:53:16,331 --> 03:53:18,472
Can you go back and ask them to change these things here?

3214
03:53:18,512 --> 03:53:21,975
Because the residential permit needs to be explained.

3215
03:53:22,055 --> 03:53:23,736
It's $10 and it's $3.

3216
03:53:23,796 --> 03:53:25,538
If you go online to get it, that's $10.

3217
03:53:26,138 --> 03:53:28,420
If you walk in, it's a $3 charge.

3218
03:53:28,480 --> 03:53:30,562
If you go online and people need to know that.

3219
03:53:30,782 --> 03:53:31,602
Is that in there?

3220
03:53:31,662 --> 03:53:32,383
It's not in there.

3221
03:53:32,423 --> 03:53:33,064
It's not in here.

3222
03:53:33,864 --> 03:53:34,845
They need to change these.

3223
03:53:35,515 --> 03:53:36,936
I mean, if this is going to be accurate.

3224
03:53:37,036 --> 03:53:38,638
I believe the mailings already went out.

3225
03:53:38,658 --> 03:53:39,438
Well, you know something?

3226
03:53:39,478 --> 03:53:40,179
Well, that's a shame.

3227
03:53:42,181 --> 03:53:44,743
This is just monetary extortion by them.

3228
03:53:44,763 --> 03:53:47,225
$3 to go online to get a permit.

3229
03:53:47,905 --> 03:53:48,386
Come on.

3230
03:53:48,446 --> 03:53:53,670
Counselor Knight, your records from the 16th.

3231
03:53:54,311 --> 03:53:56,853
Mr. President, I ask that the records remain tabled as I'm reviewing the tape.

3232
03:53:57,607 --> 03:53:59,168
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3233
03:53:59,548 --> 03:54:02,831
