[SPEAKER_04]: Motions, orders, and resolution.

14
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:48,949
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-036, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that Park Medford fix the error on the current tickets which have recipients mailing the payment to the wrong zip code.

15
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:53,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that all tickets that have been given with this error be voided.

16
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:55,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

17
00:00:57,135 --> 00:01:00,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

18
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:11,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I had put on the agenda some other troubles with Park Medford and discussed it for a few minutes.

19
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:19,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Since then, I've received additional complaints and phone calls with regards to other issues that are taking place down at Park Medford.

20
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:30,812
[SPEAKER_10]: One being something that I couldn't believe a woman forwarded me a ticket where it says you need to mail your citation

21
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:41,678
[SPEAKER_10]: money to was Medford mass 0 2 1 1 5, which is a Boston zip code and payments with this mistake may very well have got to Medford mass 0 2 1 5 5.

22
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:50,322
[SPEAKER_10]: But to have this on as a mistake, I just, I thought it was, it's just a terrible mistake.

23
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:55,964
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's something that, um, I went over about six other different things that are going on with Park Medford last week.

24
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:57,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't reiterate them.

25
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:06,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Thankfully, I did email the mayor's office, the chief of police, and I did email the new, I don't know if he's the director down in Park Medford.

26
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:12,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I received a response from the mayor's office and the chief of police, thankfully, and this has been fixed.

27
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:24,405
[SPEAKER_10]: But I feel that anybody who's received a ticket, whether it be from a broke, another complaint I've got since last week was a broken meter down in Medford Square.

28
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:25,546
[SPEAKER_10]: The meter was broken.

29
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:27,227
[SPEAKER_10]: People weren't able to feed the meter.

30
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:28,733
[SPEAKER_10]: then receive tickets.

31
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:33,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only do I think the tickets should be, should be voided.

32
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:35,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Park Medford needs to take a week.

33
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:55,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I think maybe the, hopefully the administration may maybe may take a time out from giving any tickets at all until we figure out a way to educate those who work from Park Medford to for the rules and regulations to take place and be done correctly.

34
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:55,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

35
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:16,021
[SPEAKER_10]: because the only ones that are suffering are, well, obviously we're getting the complaints, but the residents and people who are trying to traverse our business districts and use, whether it's a restaurant or a nail salon, be able to pay for parking and they're not able to, it's just not effective.

36
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Something's wrong and it needs to be fixed.

37
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:22,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a week off from, for the residents would be

38
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:47,657
[SPEAKER_10]: blessing I think to and I would think I would like to amend that and actually ask that somebody from the mayor's office take the time to be present during evaluations and make sure that everything is done smoothly and effectively because the mistakes that are taking place are affecting people at the registry, they're affecting people financially, people are getting really really upset and it's probably been 20

39
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:56,674
[SPEAKER_10]: 20 or so emails or phone calls I've gotten the last month with regards to problems with Park Medford and needs to be taken care of.

40
00:03:56,754 --> 00:04:03,896
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would request that we take a week off and really get it straight and that the administration be on top of making sure that Park Medford gets it straight.

41
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:11,798
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to make sure we protect those who are parking in our business districts and make sure the programs done correctly.

42
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,398
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be my resolve.

43
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:16,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if my council colleagues have anything else to add.

44
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I will report to you today that, um,

45
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:25,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I did talk to Dan Nash today from Park Medford and I expressed some of the concerns that I think we've all gotten.

46
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:30,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am set up a tentative meeting on February 7th at the council hall.

47
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:34,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, it's not, uh, I will probably have it confirmed in the next couple of days.

48
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that everyone, uh, will be able to make it.

49
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:45,898
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is a tentative date that I have scheduled, uh, to have Dan, uh, someone from the police and, uh, maybe the mayor's office come and,

50
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,070
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, for an hour, for an hour and a half in a council poll.

51
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will hopefully be able to report that out before the end of the week.

52
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,573
[SPEAKER_04]: So you everyone will have enough time to attend.

53
00:04:57,293 --> 00:05:00,735
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may on that, I just want to, I want to thank you very much for setting up that meeting.

54
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:08,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I asked for it last week and I know you, you've been asking for months to meet with Park Medford and I appreciate your persistence on that.

55
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:13,301
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully, hopefully it'll happen on the 7th on the motion.

56
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call.

57
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:15,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call has been requested.

58
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:22,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Please repeat the subject of the resolution, Mr. Clerk.

59
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:25,555
[SPEAKER_06]: The amendment or the actual resolution?

60
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:28,017
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we voting on at this point?

61
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:29,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the amendment was- The amendments.

62
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:41,349
[SPEAKER_06]: The resolution also is to fix the error of the current tickets, which has the recipients mailing the payment to the one zip code here for the result.

63
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,031
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all tickets that have been given

64
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,750
[SPEAKER_06]: would this error be voided?

65
00:05:46,771 --> 00:06:00,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the amendment, the amendment is that the mayor's office take the time to be present at the meeting so things can run smoothly and for power backer to take a week off from enforcement to get the program going.

66
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:01,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it together, yep.

67
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:01,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

68
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:04,836
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may ask for clarification, Mr. Mayor.

69
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:07,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

70
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:13,578
[SPEAKER_16]: Does the portion of the resolution remain intact where the councilor is requesting that all tickets issued be voided?

71
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:17,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think that's what her intent is.

72
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:19,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lococo.

73
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,221
[SPEAKER_10]: During the timeframe where parking meters are, this is one of a few are broken.

74
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:31,622
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not accepting money and where you're supposed to mail your money to Boston.

75
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:32,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I believe.

76
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,863
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know I talked to the chief of police about this.

77
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:41,765
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to hold those all to the seventh, you want to be so that with the motion, if you want to discuss that on the seventh also.

78
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to do it out on a vote tonight?

79
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think it's sufficient to say there are so many problems with Park Medford over the last few weeks.

80
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:57,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I was just looking for clarification as to whether or not that actual portion of the resolution remained intact, because I personally have a problem with that.

81
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:06,086
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel as though if I was parking in a handicapped spa without a handicapped placard and I got a ticket, regardless of where the zip code said to return the money that I owed the city of Medford to go,

82
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:09,327
[SPEAKER_16]: I should be held accountable for parking in that parking spot.

83
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:15,611
[SPEAKER_16]: If I was parking in front of a fire hydrant and I got tagged and the ticket told me that I was supposed to mail my, to pay the ticket, I should pay the ticket.

84
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:18,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, so I have a problem with that portion of the resolution, Mr. President.

85
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:28,960
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obvious is, uh, there's multiple problems with the system and my suggestion is that we all have them ready for the seventh and we'll, and hopefully we can get them all answered on that night.

86
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:33,143
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can hold that portion that they'd be voided till the seventh.

87
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,245
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just ask that the program be shut down immediately.

88
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:51,477
[SPEAKER_10]: the administration and oversee Park Medford and make sure that these kinks, we can't wait till the 7th to have these problems, broken meters, people, they're not registering whether or not you pay for your tickets and then you go to the registry, try to renew your license, you get turned away.

89
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:53,519
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not giving people parking permits.

90
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:56,181
[SPEAKER_10]: They're sending them away, telling them they need other things.

91
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,902
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that Park Medford- So that would be a B paper?

92
00:07:58,122 --> 00:07:58,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

93
00:07:58,423 --> 00:07:58,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The B paper?

94
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:06,049
[SPEAKER_04]: The B paper would be to shut the program down until all the issues are resolved.

95
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:07,763
[SPEAKER_10]: And the people are trained properly.

96
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:08,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

97
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:12,608
[SPEAKER_10]: With oversight from the mayor's office.

98
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:14,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'd be a B paper.

99
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

100
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:19,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, my question as to whether or not we have a legal basis to repudiate the contract that we entered into.

101
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:25,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't answer that.

102
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think that'd be something for us to solicit an answer.

103
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think he's in the audience this evening.

104
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:32,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if we have the legal.

105
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:34,397
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the authority to request it.

106
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:37,218
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the authority to request it, that's correct.

107
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:38,338
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

108
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,840
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, Councilor Lungo-Koehn is called for a roll call vote.

109
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, would you please read back the amendments so they know what they're voting on?

110
00:08:51,502 --> 00:08:55,183
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be voting on the B paper first, Mr. Dello Russo.

111
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:12,786
[SPEAKER_06]: So the program can run smoothly, take care of park member, take a week off from enforcement to get the program going correctly and to have the park member personnel in training.

112
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:16,868
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

113
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:17,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll on the B paper.

114
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:24,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo?

115
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:24,952
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

116
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:26,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

117
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:26,672
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

118
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:27,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

119
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:29,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I'm voting no.

120
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,984
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to reflect that I'm voting no for the purpose of questioning as to whether or not we have legal authority.

121
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:35,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Scott.

122
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:40,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Langley-Curran?

123
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:40,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

124
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice-President Marks?

125
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:42,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

126
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scott-Bell?

127
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I vote no.

128
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:54,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I'm voting no.

129
00:09:58,425 --> 00:09:59,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Two in the affirmative, five in the negative.

130
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:01,247
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion fails.

131
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:03,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

132
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, on the A paper.

133
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:08,212
[SPEAKER_04]: The A paper would be the resolution to void the tickets.

134
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,655
[SPEAKER_04]: That can be discussed on the 7th and I think

135
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:33,057
[SPEAKER_10]: The issue, I did shoot out emails right away last week, Thursday, so I think the zip code has been fixed, from what I've been told, from two parties.

136
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we'll take that out.

137
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:37,198
[SPEAKER_10]: So then that's it.

138
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:40,840
[SPEAKER_10]: So no roll call is necessary, no vote needs to be taken.

139
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:44,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, refer to the paper.

140
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:45,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

141
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:51,724
[SPEAKER_16]: I second the Councilor's motion to refer the paper to the Committee of the Whole on February 7th with Park Manfred, Mr. President.

142
00:10:52,204 --> 00:10:52,784
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favour?

143
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:53,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

144
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:54,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

145
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

146
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:15,695
[SPEAKER_04]: 17 0 3 7 offered by council Longo current be a resolve that the Medford city council be provided in update with the regards to the status of the elderly field of dreams and where we are with regards to the potential bubble.

147
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:17,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor.

148
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

149
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:23,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, president Caraviello, I have been questioned, um, just twice with regards to what happened.

150
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:24,259
[SPEAKER_10]: RFP,

151
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:27,734
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe we have somebody in the audience who does have an answer.

152
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:31,576
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'd be great if we could just be provided that answer and let the public know.

153
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:36,719
[SPEAKER_10]: People know that we, um, discussed it numerous times several months ago.

154
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:40,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Councilor Scarpelli has the floor next.

155
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:41,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

156
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:42,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I yield to Councilors.

157
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:43,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

158
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:49,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I just question as to whether or not the answer is coming from the administration, uh, the actual entity that put out the RFP.

159
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:58,911
[SPEAKER_16]: I always thought that it was a dead issue, but... Yeah, that was my understanding as well, Mr. President, but I feel as though the answer should really come from a member of the administration as opposed to someone from the general public.

160
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

161
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:10,420
[SPEAKER_14]: I did talk to the administration about this, and there has been no acceptance, so the RFP is off the table, so that's what I've been told.

162
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,122
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is a dead issue as far as... Dead issue, yeah.

163
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:13,922
[SPEAKER_04]: ...as everyone's concerned.

164
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:16,424
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that they're also... Good communication.

165
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:19,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was not aware.

166
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I was not aware, but that's what I've been told.

167
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:22,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I would appreciate put it through.

168
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:24,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Dela Russa.

169
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:27,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Dela Russa.

170
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:34,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I would request that any communique regarding the official stance of the City of Medford come from an official of the City of Medford.

171
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:35,489
[SPEAKER_04]: You are correct, Councilor Dela Russa.

172
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:38,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

173
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,250
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Robert Penta.

174
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of this august body.

175
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:50,595
[SPEAKER_12]: In May of 2016, when this issue appeared itself before the council, I came and I spoke and I relayed information for which I will again

176
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:55,034
[SPEAKER_12]: reaffirm with you after speaking with Bond Council for the City of Medford.

177
00:12:55,334 --> 00:13:05,841
[SPEAKER_12]: The City of Medford engages in a tax-exempt IRS status which provides for certain exemptions for the purposes of being excluded from tax for tax particular purposes.

178
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:20,512
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is a specific section on 2.2 called government bond status for which the City of Medford has three delineations for which it has a requirement for which it cannot engage in this type of a for-profit private business

179
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:28,218
[SPEAKER_12]: using a municipal piece of property, which would be for profit, even though some of the time would be allotted for the purposes of using the city.

180
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:35,324
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very specific in 2.2 of the section of the IRS tax exempt certificate, specifically for the city of Medford.

181
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:45,772
[SPEAKER_12]: It clearly states that a non-governmental person will be treated as using proceeds of the bonds and proceeds of each issue of prior obligation of the projects in one of three areas.

182
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:49,095
[SPEAKER_12]: One uses any portion of the projects as owner, lessee,

183
00:13:49,746 --> 00:14:04,416
[SPEAKER_12]: service provider, operator, or manager, two, acquires the output of the projects, and four, section four, enters into any other arrangement that provided a special legal entitlement or special economic benefit to the non-governmental person.

184
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:08,299
[SPEAKER_12]: That would happen as what's being presented or potentially could have been presented.

185
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:16,485
[SPEAKER_12]: And accordingly, it says that the city will not enter in any contract or other arrangement after the closing date for the operation or management of any component

186
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:22,281
[SPEAKER_12]: of the project by any party other than a governmental unit in which the governmental unit is the city of Medford.

187
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:25,262
[SPEAKER_12]: The city of Medford has a tax certificate.

188
00:14:25,642 --> 00:14:27,022
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an 11 page document.

189
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:30,183
[SPEAKER_12]: It specifically outlines subject matters such as this.

190
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:40,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Spoke to bond council last year, spoke to office again today, and there happens to be no re-interest in issuing this particular bond.

191
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:46,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, it has to have a legal review as required by the IRS on any exemption or exception.

192
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:53,112
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't believe any exception has been offered to you by any legal writing or offering or request for one.

193
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:57,034
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would say at this point in time, uh, thank you for bringing it forward.

194
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:59,396
[SPEAKER_12]: Counsel Lungo and uh, thank you.

195
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:06,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Method school committee for being so cooperative and transmitting that information back to the council, knowing that it was on the agenda this week.

196
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,441
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a shame that the communication isn't much better.

197
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:10,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

198
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive a place of second counts.

199
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:15,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor,

200
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:17,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

201
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:19,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, there was the motion, Mr. President.

202
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

203
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:28,655
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, this is a perfect time to bring up an issue that, uh, I've had, uh, with,

204
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,367
[SPEAKER_15]: a particular monument that's located on Edgeley Field.

205
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:50,251
[SPEAKER_15]: And many of us in the community may or may not be aware, but that field was named after William Budd Edgeley in a ceremony in 1972.

206
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:56,794
[SPEAKER_15]: And the monument at the time was placed in a prominent area on the field itself.

207
00:15:57,615 --> 00:16:03,998
[SPEAKER_15]: And it read, William Budd Edgeley, an outstanding athlete, public servant, and citizen of Method.

208
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:23,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And during the construction of the Field of Dreams, which I think we all agree was a tremendous asset to this community and to the student athletes at Medford High School, the monument was temporarily moved and placed at the entrance to the complex.

209
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:33,698
[SPEAKER_15]: And if anyone's been up there, and I'm sure Coach Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli can attest to this, the monument was placed in an area that's overgrown with weeds,

210
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:40,568
[SPEAKER_15]: The plaque itself is in deplorable condition, as you mentioned about some of the military plaques throughout the community.

211
00:16:41,288 --> 00:17:02,225
[SPEAKER_15]: And in my opinion, it sorely needs to be relocated onto the field area, maybe between the track and the fence in the field area, have the plaque rebuffed, Mr. President, and have a proper cement setting footing so this particular stone can go on top of the proper cement setting

212
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:07,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, it's actually sinking into the ground where it currently is, Mr. President.

213
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:29,181
[SPEAKER_15]: And it doesn't do any justice to the gentleman who gave so much of his life, Bud Edgeley, to this community and to the students of this community for so, so many years, Mr. President, that the city felt in 1972 it was enough to honor this gentleman by naming a field after him, which is a tremendous honor, Mr. President.

214
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:32,363
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would ask — I think this is the appropriate time where we're discussing

215
00:17:32,726 --> 00:18:00,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Edgeley Field that the city, maybe we could do it through the vocational students, build a cement platform relocated between the fence and the track area in actually Edgeley Field, or what we refer to as the Field of Dreams, but actually in the field itself, and that the plaque that's on the monument be buffed out, Mr. President,

216
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:02,089
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's about time.

217
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:03,951
[SPEAKER_15]: 1972 was a lot of years ago.

218
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:06,433
[SPEAKER_15]: I was only a little boy at the time.

219
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:08,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's about time we have a read.

220
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:10,176
[SPEAKER_15]: It was your graduate.

221
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:11,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy graduation.

222
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:22,827
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's about time we rededicate this particular ceremony, Mr. President, to Mr. Bud Edgeley and have a groundbreaking up there.

223
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:25,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, once again, for a gentleman,

224
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:32,052
[SPEAKER_15]: that did so much for this community and so much for the students of our public school system, Mr. President.

225
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:50,765
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that the stone be relocated onto the field, surrounding field, and also that a base, a cement base be built, if we can get the vocational school to do that as a community service project, that would be great.

226
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:54,288
[SPEAKER_15]: And also that we look at a rededication ceremony

227
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:57,844
[SPEAKER_15]: to honor Mr. William, but actually thank you.

228
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:58,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor mocks.

229
00:18:58,965 --> 00:18:59,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scott Belly.

230
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:02,008
[SPEAKER_14]: If I could thank you for Councilor Marks for bringing this up.

231
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:08,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that this was brought up in the past and I talked to a constituent just a few weeks ago here in the council chambers.

232
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:12,315
[SPEAKER_14]: I did talk to, um, athletic director Maloney about this just recently.

233
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:18,160
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, he must've been reading his mind because they've already discussed this looking forward for the spring.

234
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:31,201
[SPEAKER_14]: that the vocational school is one of their projects is to relocate that stone next to one of the benches in front of the fence and, um, built on top of some sort of cement structure.

235
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:32,462
[SPEAKER_14]: So it sits upon something.

236
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:38,568
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, the, I, I should have relayed that to everybody sooner, but I appreciate bringing that up.

237
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,449
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um,

238
00:19:40,351 --> 00:20:05,715
[SPEAKER_14]: I second that we have a rededication to a great man and someone who I, as you become a member of the coaching staff at Medford High School, one of only five head coaches in the history of Medford High Soccer, and understanding that the Fran Pelosi's, the Bud Edgeley's, the Joe Barletta's, the Skipperata's, and having my name along with those great names is,

239
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:07,707
[SPEAKER_14]: much appreciated.

240
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:10,368
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate that to bring that up and I hope to see that this spring.

241
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:11,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

242
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:11,589
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

243
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:18,151
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll call a vote has been requested on the motion.

244
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:30,936

245
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:31,536

271
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:36,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the city council set up a monthly set up a community meeting to discuss and obtain input in how the city

272
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,611
[SPEAKER_04]: should be developed going forward.

273
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:50,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lococoon, on the advice of our city solicitor, I ask that you not mention, because we have a suit pending with the Board of Appeals, that you not mention any particular case.

[SPEAKER_04]: That's in court, yes.

276
00:21:57,946 --> 00:22:03,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be met as before the board, until we have advice from our attorney.

277
00:22:09,765 --> 00:22:10,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's fine.

278

[SPEAKER_10]: Anything before the Board of Appeals while... Well, this is pertinent to the President's effort.

279
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,331
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pertinent to that.

280
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:20,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that's going on, taking a vote tomorrow night, being next Wednesday, I think it's relevant.

281
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:27,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so just try to keep it to a general... We have a case pending in court.

282
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:29,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Member O'Karn.

283
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:32,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

284
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's extremely important to bring up

285
00:22:36,962 --> 00:22:39,283
[SPEAKER_10]: what's coming down the line next.

286
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:53,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow night there's a community development meeting, that's at 6.30, and that's gonna be in discussion of the Salem Street and Court Street project, which is where the old pro break parcel is.

287
00:22:54,747 --> 00:23:05,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow night is the community development board, and then Wednesday, a week from when, Tuesday, a week from tonight is the zoning board of appeals meeting, where a number of variances are being requested by

288
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:17,748
[SPEAKER_10]: a developer, and nothing against this developer, I just, I think it's extremely important, number one, that this be brought to light because a lot of neighbors, you know, are very concerned about it.

289
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:33,056
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a proposed four-story development, 21 units, seven one-bedrooms, 12 two-bedrooms, two three-bedrooms, and they need a number of variances for insufficient lot area, lot depth,

290
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:49,443
[SPEAKER_10]: usable area, front, side, and rear setbacks, off-street parking, screening and buffer strips, exceeding maximum allowed lot coverage, height and number thereof are some of the variances that they will be seeking.

291
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:56,225
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also looking for four stories, which I believe, due to the square footage, only allows three.

292
00:23:56,906 --> 00:23:59,947
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really important that the city council

293
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,640
[SPEAKER_10]: understand what's coming forward.

294
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:14,368
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a parcel that obviously is a very large development on a parcel in a very, very highly populated area that has barely any parking available.

295
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:22,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Traffic obviously is at a high in that area, and we obviously talked about it many times about safety concerns with traffic.

296
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:35,954
[SPEAKER_10]: this council has requested a few times, I believe through my motions to set up a meeting and sit down and really discuss development with the mayor, but that doesn't seem to have been happening in the last year.

297
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:47,437
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's really important that the city council, we sit down, we have our own meeting and we invite anybody who's interested in development to come to a, whether it be a city council meeting or a,

298
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:53,352
[SPEAKER_10]: if we have a public hearing, we need to know where we're going, where we're moving forward.

299
00:24:53,452 --> 00:25:01,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now we've into, you know, I feel like we've really appeased to anything developers have wanted.

300
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:05,061
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know if I feel like the people deserve better.

301
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:08,584
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to make sure our neighborhoods are not getting overstuffed.

302
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:14,169
[SPEAKER_10]: We, we need to make sure that our, I have another resolution coming down with regards to class size.

303
00:25:14,731 --> 00:25:18,894
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a couple of schools in Medford that cannot fit another classroom.

304
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:23,938
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have 500 units coming that are actually being developed currently.

305
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:26,219
[SPEAKER_10]: We have other proposed developments.

306
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have a number of, I know this developer in particular is looking for other parcels currently.

307
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:34,265
[SPEAKER_10]: We just need to make the people aware.

308
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:43,412
[SPEAKER_10]: And the people in this council are really all that the community has at this point to make sure we develop correctly, smart development.

309
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:48,067
[SPEAKER_10]: We want development, we want good developers in Medford, but we need to make sure it's smart.

310
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:52,430
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a project that was denied on Canal Street, 15 units.

311
00:25:52,730 --> 00:26:09,480
[SPEAKER_10]: We need some conformity, and we need smart development, and I really am interested in listening to the people from every area in this community and figuring out what the needs are, what the wants are, and obviously this is the project that's coming up next before the Zoning Board of Appeals.

312
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,001
[SPEAKER_10]: It's of interest to me.

313
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:13,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I have children in the school, I traversed

314
00:26:14,827 --> 00:26:19,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what our, from having council meetings, we know what our infrastructure's like.

315
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,469
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs some improvement.

316
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:31,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Marks has discussed piping, you know, he's the expert on that, but there's just so many issues and so many reasons why we, as a council, need to be on top of this.

317
00:26:32,111 --> 00:26:41,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like sometimes we're the only voice for the neighborhoods on certain things, and this is one that needs some voices, and it's one that I know a number of neighbors are concerned about.

318
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:55,423
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to invite the whole community and we need to have a public meeting on it and discuss development and the issuance of variances because some like to say that it's not in the council purview, but zoning is in the council purview.

319
00:26:55,843 --> 00:27:02,205
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's something we don't have time to wait, we have to review our zoning, but we don't have the year it will take.

320
00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:03,905
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to be on top of this now.

321
00:27:04,546 --> 00:27:09,567
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just ask that my council colleagues support having a public meeting, I ask for the support

322
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:32,921
[SPEAKER_10]: going forward and trying to get the Community Development Board and the Zoning Board of Appeals to see what the people are crying out for, see where the council's at, so we can make some change and we can make some change on how things are approved and not approved and how developers come into this city and the mindset they have with regards to, oh, we can do anything we want in Medford.

323
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:33,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that shouldn't be.

324
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,103
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not good for this community.

325
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,901
[SPEAKER_10]: and we need to make a stand.

326
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,502
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to have this meeting.

327
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:42,343
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to have our voices heard.

328
00:27:42,803 --> 00:27:45,004
[SPEAKER_10]: So for, for the neighborhoods, it has to happen.

329
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:45,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

330
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Council council night.

331
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:49,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

332
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:52,269
[SPEAKER_16]: And I appreciate council Longo putting this resolution on.

333
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:59,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so as she stated, uh, tomorrow evening, the office of community development will be having a meeting at 6 PM in room 207.

334
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:01,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, I'm sorry.

335
00:28:02,804 --> 00:28:04,145
[SPEAKER_16]: 308, I'm sorry, 308, 630 p.m.

336
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:04,145
630, 308.

337
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:08,948
[SPEAKER_16]: To discuss this very issue, Mr. President, the development of the parcel that was noted.

338
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:17,734
[SPEAKER_16]: And then one week from this evening, the Zoning Board of Appeals will be meeting to take up the question of whether or not they are willing to approve the requested variances.

339
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:25,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I personally feel as though the Zoning Board of Appeals is is an independent, autonomous body that should operate free from undue influence.

340
00:28:26,801 --> 00:28:30,243
[SPEAKER_16]: When matters are before the Zoning Board of Appeals, they are applications.

341
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,438
[SPEAKER_16]: The Zoning Board of Appeals then makes a decision.

342
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:44,509
[SPEAKER_16]: As the Medford City Council, we have standing in every single decision that the Zoning Board of Appeals has made to then further question the decisions that are made and potentially pull this case into litigation, which we've done in the past.

343
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:50,815
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think it's very important that the residents of the community get out and take a look at what's going on in the neighborhood.

344
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:55,571
[SPEAKER_16]: attend this meeting and express their concerns to the zoning board of appeals on Wednesday, on Tuesday, the 31st.

345
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:55,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

346
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:59,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's many, uh, members of the community who were unaware of the meeting.

347
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:02,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope everybody watching is aware of these two dates.

348
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:03,356
[SPEAKER_04]: So please take note of that.

349
00:29:03,996 --> 00:29:04,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

350
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:06,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

351
00:29:06,838 --> 00:29:09,079
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to thank council Lungo-Koehn for bringing this forward.

352
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, this is a very important issue.

353
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:18,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, development is, uh, an issue that really is affecting every neighborhood throughout this city.

354
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,306
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter where you go,

355
00:29:21,197 --> 00:29:24,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Contractors or developers are coming in and they're trying to build apartments.

356
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,579
[SPEAKER_09]: They want all kinds of variances.

357
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, zoning is a major issue that needs to be looked at.

358
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, you know, it needs to be looked at soon.

359
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:36,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sooner than later, because, you know, we haven't looked at it in years.

360
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:46,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, but I mean, as you go from neighborhood to neighborhood, I, down in Wellington, this, uh, 500 units, uh, you go over to Middlesex Ave, it's a few hundred units all over the place.

361
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:49,707
[SPEAKER_09]: People want to develop and they want to come in and they want more and more variances.

362
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:50,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Where does it end?

363
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:54,352
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a quality of life issue because you bring a new development.

364
00:29:54,652 --> 00:29:56,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with the councilor.

365
00:29:57,793 --> 00:30:02,775
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's saying we don't want any development, but you want smart development, development that makes sense within the community.

366
00:30:03,575 --> 00:30:06,256
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're overdeveloping, you have all kinds of other issues that come with that.

367
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:12,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Traffic and traffic related issues are a problem now with the current number of units that we had throughout the city.

368
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:19,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And you want to add over a thousand more units when you add all these different developments up, you're compounding the problems by the day.

369
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:22,434
[SPEAKER_09]: This needs to be looked at.

370
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:23,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope people attend these meetings.

371
00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:27,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, uh, it's, it's vital that people get involved.

372
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:29,137
[SPEAKER_09]: It's vital that their voices are heard.

373
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:40,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, these, uh, you know, these, these developments, people think, well, it's just one small development here, one small development there, but as they add up, it becomes a major issue throughout this community.

374
00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:41,743
[SPEAKER_09]: So I support the resolution.

375
00:30:41,783 --> 00:30:42,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank you for bringing it forward.

376
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:43,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

377
00:30:43,404 --> 00:30:43,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor.

378
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:45,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

379
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:45,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Move approval.

380
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:47,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval.

381
00:30:47,786 --> 00:30:48,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

382
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:51,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

383
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:55,163
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank council Lungo-Koehn, uh, for bringing this up.

384
00:30:55,844 --> 00:31:00,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, zoning is probably the first, the second most important role of this council.

385
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:06,696
[SPEAKER_15]: So don't let anyone tell you otherwise that, uh, there's a zoning board and there is a zoning board.

386
00:31:06,736 --> 00:31:12,102
[SPEAKER_15]: And I realized it's created by state statute, but it's this council that creates zoning ordinances.

387
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:16,561
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's this council that dictates, uh, what the audiences will be.

388
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:22,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, uh, I attended a meeting on a project that I won't name on, uh, Salem street.

389
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:26,247
[SPEAKER_15]: And there were a number of residents in the room at the time.

390
00:31:26,748 --> 00:31:30,170
[SPEAKER_15]: And the developer was going through and says, I want to build five stories.

391
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,771
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to do this and that.

392
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,453
[SPEAKER_15]: And the neighbors turned to the developer and said,

393
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:40,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Why do you want to build so high next to a two family home and block out our sunlight?

394
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:47,512
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, well, that is the direction we received from the administration that they're looking for high density development.

395
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:56,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think when you have the administration sending out one message to developers, Hey, we're looking for high density development like we see on locus street.

396
00:31:57,209 --> 00:32:06,834
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you have residents that are actually in the community saying, wait a minute, uh, that might be appropriate for certain areas, but certainly not next to my house.

397
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:10,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and I think they have a valid, valid concern, Mr. President.

398
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:23,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, another thing, uh, as was mentioned, uh, variances, variances, uh, meant, uh, to, uh, help, uh, potentially develop a, that has a hardship.

399
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:25,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, a hardship is not the fact that,

400
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,181
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to make this project as dense as possible so I can make the most money as possible.

401
00:32:31,461 --> 00:32:32,482
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not a hardship.

402
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:40,123
[SPEAKER_15]: A hardship is possibly a lot configuration, how the lot is configured, if there's groundwater in that lot.

403
00:32:41,184 --> 00:32:50,846
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a number of hardships that have nothing to do with having a developer make the most he can from a particular lot.

404
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,067
[SPEAKER_15]: And from what I'm seeing in the community, and this is what troubles me,

405
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:59,751
[SPEAKER_15]: is that variances are being given out based on hardship that really isn't a hardship.

406
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:11,754
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, we're not in the business because someone bought a lot and they can only build up three stories, but they'd rather build 10 stories so they can put in another 45 condos.

407
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:13,814
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not a hardship in my opinion.

408
00:33:14,114 --> 00:33:18,995
[SPEAKER_15]: The lot was what it was, the ordinances were in place when you bought it, and that's not a hardship.

409
00:33:19,015 --> 00:33:22,316
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't find out after the fact you can only go up three stories.

410
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:23,236
[SPEAKER_15]: You knew about it.

411
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:25,409
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's not a hardship, Mr. President.

412
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:36,192
[SPEAKER_15]: I would ask again this council, if we do nothing this year at all, Mr. President, which I hope we don't, but zoning is one of the most important issues we have to meet on.

413
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:40,013
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've been saying it over and over again, and we have to get together.

414
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:44,334
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with Councilor Falco who brought up a suggestion of bringing in a consultant.

415
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:48,055
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the MMA was brought up before and so forth.

416
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:51,196
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think we do need some guidance on this.

417
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Zoning is a very complex issue, and I don't think we have any zoning experts behind this reel, and I certainly don't claim to be one.

418
00:33:59,224 --> 00:34:01,845
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think we have to do this sooner than later, Mr. President.

419
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:08,348
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, once we get some guidance and start the process, then I agree with public hearings.

420
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:10,209
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we should have a ton of public hearings.

421
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:18,273
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think we really should get our feet wet in it first, sit down with someone that's a zoning expert that does zoning consulting,

422
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:23,569
[SPEAKER_15]: and see what direction we want to go in as a council, and then move forward.

423
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:29,854
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would ask under your leadership, Mr. President, that I know you have a lot on your plate for Committee of the Whole meetings.

424
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:36,518
[SPEAKER_15]: We have one for the police department, because a lot of backlog from the last council president.

425
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:46,925
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would ask that you move forward on the zoning, Mr. President, because it is the lifeline of a community, and we have to move forward on that, Mr. President.

426
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:48,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Miles.

427
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:48,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lococo-Kern.

428
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,369
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll yield to the residents that want to speak.

429
00:34:55,072 --> 00:34:56,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address on the record, please.

430
00:34:56,634 --> 00:34:58,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

431
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:02,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 281 Park Street, so I'm fairly close to the project that we're discussing.

432
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:10,892
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to, pardon me as I'm going to read, but I think that the city council has a lot more control over zoning today than they actually believe.

433
00:35:11,412 --> 00:35:20,299
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the Massachusetts law, chapter 40, section 10 on titled ordinances, the permit granting authority, which in our case is the ZBA has the power to have a hearing.

434
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:27,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll skip through a little bit after they notify all in to right.

435
00:35:29,975 --> 00:35:41,288
[SPEAKER_00]: such permaculture owing to circumstances, so they're only supposed to give us circumstances, variances for circumstances relating to soil conditions, shape, or topography of such land or structures.

436
00:35:42,457 --> 00:35:47,982
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially affecting such land or structures, but not affecting generally the zoning district in which is located.

437
00:35:48,442 --> 00:36:08,059
[SPEAKER_00]: A literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner or appellate, and that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good, and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the ordinance.

438
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:09,019
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

439
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, that's not how our variances are being granted.

440
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:19,745
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this parcel is fairly rectangular in shape, so the topography is okay.

441
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:21,586
[SPEAKER_00]: He's allowed to build three levels.

442
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:28,730
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why we have space around people's houses, because somebody else's house shouldn't be in the shadow of a building.

443
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:32,648
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be not developer-centric.

444
00:36:32,688 --> 00:36:33,929
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be people-centric.

445
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:38,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage people to come to these meetings because this is happening now on Salem Street.

446
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,811
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the same meeting where the developer told us he was encouraged by the administration.

447
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:48,212
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that he was told that they were hoping to build 10 to 12 buildings on Salem Street.

448
00:36:48,232 --> 00:36:49,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't just one building.

449
00:36:49,952 --> 00:36:53,753
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine if we built 10 to 12 buildings, each with 21 units.

450
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:56,894
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about an addition of 210 to approximately 250 units on the overcrowded Salem Street.

451
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:04,916
[SPEAKER_00]: The surrounding streets in this area are so overcrowded with cars.

452
00:37:05,276 --> 00:37:08,317
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming in and they're looking for residential parking permits.

453
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:09,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Everett Street has residential parking.

454
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:11,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Parts of Tainter have residential parking.

455
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Court Street has parking on one side.

456
00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:16,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Park Street at that location has parking on one side.

457
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,101
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a school that's the largest in the entire city, elementary school.

458
00:37:21,561 --> 00:37:23,142
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have room for any more children.

459
00:37:23,562 --> 00:37:26,423
[SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, we have to start considering that

460
00:37:26,923 --> 00:37:31,606
[SPEAKER_00]: These variants being granted are not for the good of the city they're only for the good of the developer.

461
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:45,553
[SPEAKER_00]: The developer who will cash his check and walk away and leave us hanging on trying to figure out how we're going to cover the extra infrastructure costs that have suddenly been thrust upon us as these people are welcome if they follow zoning.

462
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:53,697
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't just keep overbuilding and pretending that the infrastructure costs aren't real, that the cost to people's quality of life aren't real, because they are.

463
00:37:54,278 --> 00:38:03,023
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope people will come tomorrow to the community development meeting at 6.30, and most importantly, come to the zoning board meeting next Tuesday at 7 p.m.

464
00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:04,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

465
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address of the record, please.

466
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:15,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this board.

467
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:23,833
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, one of the things that are interesting on the petition that's before the Community Development Board tomorrow night is the fact that the gentleman who was making the petition owns the property.

468
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:26,114
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't buy the property on any contingencies.

469
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:32,058
[SPEAKER_12]: He came in there originally, because I went to the meeting in August, I believe he came in there originally looking for a five-story building.

470
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:39,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Then he's now downsized it to a four-story building, and he secured through the neighborhood another piece of property for which, I don't know if he bought it, it's under a P&S agreement.

471
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:45,083
[SPEAKER_12]: But the fact of the matter is, it's no more than a three story allowance on that piece of property.

472
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:49,467
[SPEAKER_12]: The then Medford City Council made that discretion that three stories would be it.

473
00:38:49,967 --> 00:39:08,303
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we keep breaking these rules, so to speak, without having a public hearing or a discussion as to why it should go from three to four to five, whatever it might be, then you've lost your impact, you've lost your legislative authority and your ability to understand why you need to change zoning and for what particular purpose.

474
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:25,898
[SPEAKER_12]: If you let this, or if they let this go through tomorrow night, through the Community Development Board, and subsequent to that, to the Zoning Board of Appeals, what you're gonna be doing is you're technically, you're spot zoning the entire city over there, and if you allow one, come in, the past practice has already been established, and it's just gonna keep going on down the street.

475
00:39:26,578 --> 00:39:37,345
[SPEAKER_12]: As Cheryl just alluded to, you have the Roberts Junior School over there, the middle school, the elementary school, for kids that are going there, they're already maxed out, the parking is horrendous on any one particular day.

476
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately for the developer, he probably should've sat down and thought this thing out first.

477
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:51,291
[SPEAKER_12]: But as it was said, this administration, as I've heard it said myself, is looking for high density because the more they bring in, it's the more money coming in.

478
00:39:51,531 --> 00:39:54,454
[SPEAKER_12]: And what you're doing is you're ruining the neighborhoods of the city of Medford.

479
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:57,877
[SPEAKER_12]: And you just cannot continue to do that.

480
00:39:58,317 --> 00:39:59,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Locust Street is the perfect example.

481
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:02,200
[SPEAKER_12]: The council has stepped up to the plate.

482
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,342
[SPEAKER_12]: You've gotten your own attorney as well as the neighbors.

483
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:12,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't let these little inconsistencies bog you down by making you feel sorry or bad for the person because he's spending the money.

484
00:40:12,782 --> 00:40:22,024
[SPEAKER_12]: If a person is going to be that foolish to spend his money and buy a piece of property not knowing that the zoning is not in hand, then the problem is on his hand, not yours.

485
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:26,765
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really think, Mr. President, this would be the year to have a complete zoning review.

486
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:27,645
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it hasn't been.

487
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:30,936
[SPEAKER_12]: since the 70s that has taken place, I think now's the time.

488
00:40:31,156 --> 00:40:39,903
[SPEAKER_12]: You couldn't have any better of examples, whether it be Locust Street, whether it be here, go on the Fellsway on the corner, I think of the Fellsway, I can't think of the name of the street.

489
00:40:40,363 --> 00:40:43,045
[SPEAKER_12]: They're building an apartment building where there was a two-family house.

490
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:45,967
[SPEAKER_12]: It just continues to go on and on and on.

491
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:48,409
[SPEAKER_12]: City's not meant to be made out of bricks and stones.

492
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:56,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford is meant to be made of people living in a neighborhood that they get along, it's compatible, it reflects the zoning,

493
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:58,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And it reflects the temperament of the day.

494
00:40:58,737 --> 00:41:03,863
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't reflect big business coming in, sucking up the money, and then leaving.

495
00:41:04,103 --> 00:41:07,487
[SPEAKER_12]: You couldn't get a better example of that than Lumineer on Locust Street.

496
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,069
[SPEAKER_12]: They build 160 units.

497
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:10,790
[SPEAKER_12]: He was there for less than one year.

498
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:14,835
[SPEAKER_12]: He sold it for $160 million, and he's gone, and he's out of town.

499
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:20,919
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what we're getting, people coming in, taking advantage of the property, building it up, and then leaving.

500
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:22,760
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not what Medford's all about.

501
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,641
[SPEAKER_12]: But if that's what this administration wants, well then shame on her.

502
00:41:27,261 --> 00:41:33,964
[SPEAKER_12]: She should understand, and she's lived in this community long enough to know that that should not be the direction of how this city goes.

503
00:41:34,584 --> 00:41:36,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Building is not always better.

504
00:41:36,805 --> 00:41:38,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Better is being smarter.

505
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

506
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:39,606
Thank you.

507
00:41:42,387 --> 00:41:43,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

508
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:47,674
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to point out one more thing.

509
00:41:47,694 --> 00:41:53,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I discussed the overcrowded schools, the infrastructure, the neighborhoods, the neighbors.

510
00:41:53,616 --> 00:41:54,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunlight was brought up.

511
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:56,377
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many different things.

512
00:41:57,137 --> 00:42:11,282
[SPEAKER_10]: But when Councilor Marks brought up the fact that our administration wants high density, with the fact that we have an understaffed police station, understaffed fire station, police cars, police station, I won't go there.

513
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,410
[SPEAKER_10]: We need some balance.

514
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only do we need the community's input, but we need some balance.

515
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:27,237
[SPEAKER_10]: We may have standing to file suit against the Zoning Board of Appeals, but I think why even get to that point when we can be discussing it now and making the changes now?

516
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:30,499
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a committee of three people on the Zoning Board.

517
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:37,583
[SPEAKER_10]: This is probably something that should be done in Committee of the Whole, although it's going to take many meetings, but it needs to be done.

518
00:42:37,643 --> 00:42:41,685
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a community meeting has to happen first so we know how our

519
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,840
[SPEAKER_10]: residents want to see their streets, their community developed.

520
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,240
[SPEAKER_10]: That needs to happen now.

521
00:42:47,380 --> 00:43:04,885
[SPEAKER_10]: So I asked for a roll call vote that a meeting be set up, whether it be one potentially at a city council meeting at seven o'clock, we designate two hours to listen to the people and let's see who comes and let's see who wants to tell us how they see their neighborhood, their streets and their community developed.

522
00:43:06,566 --> 00:43:07,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

523
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:10,587
[SPEAKER_16]: On that point, Mr. President, something that's happened very recently that's been very successful.

524
00:43:11,364 --> 00:43:14,585
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, it's been the taking of the monthly police meetings to the neighborhoods.

525
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:22,407
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that this might be a perfect opportunity, uh, to do that relative to, uh, committees of the whole focus.

526
00:43:22,427 --> 00:43:27,568
[SPEAKER_04]: You are chaiming of zoning boy, focusing on, uh, uh, councilor Russo and councilor Falco.

527
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:33,310
[SPEAKER_04]: This may be a tax that will be assigned to you to, to get out to the neighborhoods.

528
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,551
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's something that I certainly don't have a problem with Mr. President.

529
00:43:35,611 --> 00:43:39,752
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've, I've stated it, um, continuously and consistently, uh, this whole entire term.

530
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:40,932
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no problem with doing the zoning.

531
00:43:41,191 --> 00:43:45,532
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no problem bringing an outside consultant to review the zoning for a purpose.

532
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:46,432
[SPEAKER_16]: What's that purpose?

533
00:43:46,472 --> 00:43:47,492
[SPEAKER_16]: What direction are we going in?

534
00:43:47,532 --> 00:43:50,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it to develop an affordable housing plan?

535
00:43:50,173 --> 00:43:51,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it to develop an open space plan?

536
00:43:51,793 --> 00:43:55,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it to create economic economic development zones?

537
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,974
[SPEAKER_16]: What, what is the purpose and what direction do we want to go in?

538
00:43:58,295 --> 00:44:01,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Once we figure out what direction we want to go in, then let's bring, let's bring the consultant in.

539
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,416
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think the council Longo is correct.

540
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:04,756
[SPEAKER_15]: One information Councilor Marks.

541
00:44:05,836 --> 00:44:09,797
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the basic premises to review our zoning ordinances,

542
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:13,350
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we can decide if there's a particular direction we want to go in.

543
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:21,034
[SPEAKER_15]: But in my opinion, what we have to do is sit down with someone, consulted, and just take a look at all our zoning ordinances.

544
00:44:21,555 --> 00:44:30,239
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we can maybe go into different directions, or maybe appoint certain committees to do different things, because there's hundreds of pages of zoning ordinances.

545
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:35,062
[SPEAKER_15]: So I agree, but I think we don't have to make this any more complex than it is.

546
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:35,682
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd agree with you.

547
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:39,484
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why I was going to agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn that we need to go to the community first and hear what it is that the people want.

548
00:44:39,962 --> 00:44:40,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

549
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:43,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

550
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:47,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

551
00:44:47,548 --> 00:44:48,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

552
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:50,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I also agree.

553
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:55,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that, um, you know, you took the police meetings out to the community and that's worked out really well.

554
00:44:56,054 --> 00:45:03,659
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be great to, uh, take the zoning meetings out as well and, and, uh, to hear from each of the community, uh, each of the neighborhoods.

555
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:07,622
[SPEAKER_09]: But, uh, last year when I offered the resolution with regard to zoning,

556
00:45:08,016 --> 00:45:11,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I still stand by it, and that's that we should have someone from the outside come in.

557
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:19,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, like Councilor Marks mentioned before, really none of us are qualified to look at zoning.

558
00:45:20,668 --> 00:45:22,090
[SPEAKER_09]: We really don't have the background in zoning.

559
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,272
[SPEAKER_09]: So really, we should have someone come in.

560
00:45:24,492 --> 00:45:28,616
[SPEAKER_09]: We should also have, the mayor should also be giving us her plan.

561
00:45:28,696 --> 00:45:31,599
[SPEAKER_09]: What does she want, what is her plan for this city?

562
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:35,680
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I think, I believe, I- Point of information, Councilor Knight.

563
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:43,884
[SPEAKER_16]: I do believe at the third meeting of 2017, this council did pass a resolution asking for a meeting with the mayor to discuss development and her vision for what direction the city of Metro will go.

564
00:45:43,904 --> 00:45:45,665
[SPEAKER_04]: You are correct, Councilor Knight, as that has not happened.

565
00:45:45,905 --> 00:45:47,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly, but have we got a date yet on that?

566
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:49,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry?

567
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:50,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Have we got a date yet on that meeting?

568
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:51,368
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not.

569
00:45:51,608 --> 00:45:54,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, if you could please reach out to the administration.

570
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I will do my best to talk to the mayor tomorrow and get a date.

571
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,012
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be greatly appreciated.

572
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:01,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Locario.

573
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:10,908
[SPEAKER_10]: it would be great to have her input, but at the same time, this is city council prerogative and we need to, we need to take charge now cause it's going to take a year to do.

574
00:46:11,248 --> 00:46:12,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And that might even be too late.

575
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:15,131
[SPEAKER_10]: So a community meeting has to come first.

576
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:20,534
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to figure out what we want and then hire a consultant to say, how do we get it done?

577
00:46:21,075 --> 00:46:23,156
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you.

578
00:46:23,316 --> 00:46:23,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

579
00:46:23,837 --> 00:46:27,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

580
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

581
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,762
[SPEAKER_09]: But I, but I also believe that, um, you know, we need to,

582
00:46:32,228 --> 00:46:33,289
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of get everybody on board.

583
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:38,671
[SPEAKER_09]: But I honestly feel, I still believe it today, that we need to have someone from the outside take a look at this.

584
00:46:38,691 --> 00:46:39,252
[SPEAKER_09]: You are correct.

585
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:40,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

586
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:41,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

587
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:56,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I know that some of my fellow colleagues don't believe this is the way to go, but when you're talking about a consultant, I agree a thousand percent, but what always comes back from administration is cost and cost and what can we afford, and that's something that we should make a priority.

588
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,782
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm gonna make a suggestion again.

589
00:46:59,722 --> 00:47:01,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Something that has already been paid for,

590
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:08,056
[SPEAKER_14]: by becoming a member of the Metropolitan Planning Board that we are actually part of their board.

591
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:13,658
[SPEAKER_14]: We can actually ask them right now to come in now to ask for their guidance, because this is what they do.

592
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:15,739
[SPEAKER_14]: They're already working for us.

593
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,502
[SPEAKER_14]: We're using them at Medford Square, and they're leading us in that way.

594
00:47:21,122 --> 00:47:27,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Why wouldn't we ask them to come to these meetings and give us some guidance?

595
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe the attorney that we hired actually told us

596
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:35,473
[SPEAKER_14]: this is, when I spoke to them, that this is the way we can go.

597
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:45,861
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know some members don't believe in it, but, um, because one of the, I'm going to guarantee everybody here, we're going to know that the first thing to say for a consultant, the budget, the money, it's just going to delay everything.

598
00:47:45,921 --> 00:47:57,929
[SPEAKER_14]: And I agree with all of my fellow colleagues, but it would, it hurt us to ask someone from that board to be here in our corner to lend advice because this is what they do.

599
00:47:58,429 --> 00:47:58,950
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't.

600
00:48:00,231 --> 00:48:01,091
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I, I, I,

601
00:48:02,952 --> 00:48:11,699
[SPEAKER_14]: I strongly suggest that I agree with bringing an outside consultant, and again, that's going to take time.

602
00:48:11,979 --> 00:48:16,623
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about pending issues that are affecting our neighborhoods every single day.

603
00:48:17,343 --> 00:48:26,430
[SPEAKER_14]: And we can reach out to a board, a metropolitan board that we've actually worked with, that we have evidence that they're working with that, that we move on.

604
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,833
[SPEAKER_14]: We ask them to come in and lend some advice so we can have

605
00:48:31,113 --> 00:48:35,716
[SPEAKER_14]: a vision, a direction, where to go with our audiences that haven't been looked at in over 30 years.

606
00:48:36,197 --> 00:48:36,697
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

607
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:37,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

608
00:48:37,477 --> 00:48:39,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Dello Russo.

609
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:44,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, uh, I agreed that community input will be very helpful to guide us.

610
00:48:45,243 --> 00:48:59,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a starting point, I think we've had a great deal of community input with regards to development in some of the commercial districts when the transition team, uh, last winter undertook various community meetings.

611
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:17,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So by accessing the committee on developments report on the city's webpage, we can have at least some baseline of what some people are looking for, many residents are looking for in our commercial districts.

612
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:27,050
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the areas that has become greatly irksome to all of us is the development in residential neighborhoods.

613
00:49:27,537 --> 00:49:29,818
[SPEAKER_02]: and the impact it's having on where people live.

614
00:49:30,399 --> 00:49:33,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to be conscious of that and we need to move forward.

615
00:49:33,481 --> 00:49:36,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree a starting point would be a community meeting.

616
00:49:36,663 --> 00:49:51,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And I further agree on Councilor Knight's suggestion that those meetings be conducted in neighborhoods where people live and where they're affected by this development day in and day out.

617
00:49:52,152 --> 00:49:56,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to set the record straight, Mr. President, I am not opposed

618
00:49:57,445 --> 00:50:11,598
[SPEAKER_02]: to the influence, assistance, in fact I welcome the influence, assistance, and direction of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council's resources that we pay for.

619
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:21,608
[SPEAKER_02]: My point in adding caution to them is that their interests are not always necessarily for MedFed in particular,

620
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:25,628
[SPEAKER_02]: but for the metropolitan area as a whole.

621
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:34,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we engage their assistance on any project, I just hope that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water, Mr. President.

622
00:50:35,272 --> 00:50:35,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

623
00:50:35,913 --> 00:50:38,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for those words of wisdom, Councilor Dello Russo.

624
00:50:39,754 --> 00:50:40,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

625
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:42,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

626
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:46,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Honorable Council, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Method Mass.

627
00:50:48,718 --> 00:50:51,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try to be short, concise, and hopefully

628
00:50:52,478 --> 00:50:57,121
[SPEAKER_08]: mathematically, uh, correct on a common sense basis.

629
00:50:57,922 --> 00:51:03,306
[SPEAKER_08]: First two questions before I go on, I believe it's 21 units of staff for Salem street.

630
00:51:04,887 --> 00:51:07,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And how many parking spots?

631
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:08,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't catch that.

632
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:10,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

633
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:11,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Unknown.

634
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:13,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

635
00:51:13,453 --> 00:51:16,595
[SPEAKER_04]: The application has been submitted at school council along.

636
00:51:16,635 --> 00:51:17,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

637
00:51:17,996 --> 00:51:21,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I read, I went to, um, city hall and,

638
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:22,891
[SPEAKER_10]: reviewed the plans.

639
00:51:22,991 --> 00:51:33,574
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like there's 40 parking spots which would bring it from the one they proposed in August up to 1.5 per unit, and our zoning requires 2.1.

640
00:51:34,814 --> 00:51:37,174
[SPEAKER_10]: So there would be a need for a variance.

641
00:51:37,414 --> 00:51:38,535
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I'm getting at.

642
00:51:38,555 --> 00:51:40,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Brianna.

643
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:49,317
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems on that side of town, East Medford, it's in high demand from

644
00:51:50,686 --> 00:51:55,148
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of developers for various reasons.

645
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:16,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And my concern is since parking seems to be a problem and is at a premium for most of us in that area, I can understand as Councilor Marks mentioned quite perfectly that are variants asked for under hardship to

646
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:26,790
[SPEAKER_08]: change, whatever, so they can go for the longest dollars.

647
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:32,612
[SPEAKER_08]: But hardship is not an issue when it's purely capitalism.

648
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:43,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would think if you're going to issue a variance as far as height, setbacks, et cetera, that's one thing.

649
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:45,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I don't have to live next door to it.

650
00:52:47,156 --> 00:52:49,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people behind me too.

651
00:52:50,438 --> 00:52:59,981
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm speaking again, common sense, mathematically speaking only, although it affects me when I go to the bicycle store across the street.

652
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:10,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Seems to me it's at a premium in certain sections, at least two of these on the compass roads, the South on East side.

653
00:53:12,005 --> 00:53:19,127
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I would say to a board of appeals, please,

654
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:26,342
[SPEAKER_08]: The 2.1 parking spots per unit should not ever be negotiable.

655
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:35,766
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have that tune and tool and weapon in your arsenal as we speak presently without worrying about zoning changes down the road.

656
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:44,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Just thinking out loud, hopefully attend the meeting and make those, uh, uh, concerns.

657
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:49,933
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Ricky, I hope to make a God willing, but on the other hand,

658
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:57,277
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a great city and a lot of what in a lot of ways really is by we live here.

659
00:53:57,637 --> 00:53:59,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Location is incredible.

660
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,202
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we're an underachiever by far.

661
00:54:05,563 --> 00:54:06,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I can agree with that.

662
00:54:07,564 --> 00:54:08,825
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to cut this stuff out.

663
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:12,988
[SPEAKER_08]: One side of Mr. Gav should all be 25 stories high.

664
00:54:13,028 --> 00:54:13,988
[SPEAKER_08]: 35 years ago.

665
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:16,010
[SPEAKER_08]: One side only with a ring road.

666
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:17,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep them off main street.

667
00:54:17,711 --> 00:54:19,412
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want to go to the old deepest qualities.

668
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:21,956
[SPEAKER_08]: If you worked here, you'd be at work now.

669
00:54:22,016 --> 00:54:24,857
[SPEAKER_08]: As Sloan took my idea 10 years ago for his billboard.

670
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:28,818
[SPEAKER_08]: The location is incredible.

671
00:54:29,438 --> 00:54:30,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Baxter was right.

672
00:54:30,499 --> 00:54:35,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would you want to put that kind of a Springstead building in front of the city hall and block our view?

673
00:54:37,401 --> 00:54:44,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we have phase two from the Green Line if the squeaky wheel Tufts University ever gets their subway stop?

674
00:54:44,924 --> 00:54:49,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Or why don't phase two, instead of redundantly go to the west side of town,

675
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:51,769
[SPEAKER_08]: The squeaky wheels already have the commuter line.

676
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Malden Center has downtown subway.

677
00:54:56,272 --> 00:55:00,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Winchester Center has it above ground, mind you, in the town of Winchester.

678
00:55:00,434 --> 00:55:05,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, why not have it come from Tufts when they eventually get it?

679
00:55:05,437 --> 00:55:15,802
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not double over the budget and underground as the crow flies three quarters of a mile and no eminent domain at all.

680
00:55:17,123 --> 00:55:17,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And

681
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:31,437
[SPEAKER_08]: You have Emerge right behind you, Councilor Rick, at the Redbrick Building, that I would take by eminent domain, because I don't go to the dentist there.

682
00:55:31,457 --> 00:55:45,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would have a subway entrance right there, and this is not Andrew Castagnetti's idea, this is Mr. Dick Ober's idea, retired electrical engineer, and he used to take care of Chevalier, like the Phantom of the Opera.

683
00:55:46,867 --> 00:55:48,568
[SPEAKER_08]: It's his idea, it's not Andrew's idea.

684
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:58,952
[SPEAKER_08]: And furthermore, I would add a tour clipper ship on the river, and you could chauffeur in tourists from all over the world.

685
00:55:58,972 --> 00:56:06,955
[SPEAKER_08]: 10,000 a day with pockets full of Japanese yen, euro, whatever, and put us back on the map, because we built clipper ships.

686
00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:06,955
550.

687
00:56:07,995 --> 00:56:11,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Over 50 was longer than Edgley Field of Dreams.

688
00:56:12,437 --> 00:56:13,077
[SPEAKER_08]: It's incredible.

689
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,512
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and who would pay for this subway underground?

690
00:56:18,373 --> 00:56:19,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Mexico.

691
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:20,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Have Tufts pay for it.

692
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:22,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.

693
00:56:22,876 --> 00:56:23,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

694
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:27,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

695
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:29,880
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rosalyn Machado.

696
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I own the property at 10 court street, right up behind where he wants to build.

697
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:37,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you this developer has no regard for what anybody wants.

698
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:42,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I have had phone conversations with him regarding parking and fumes because now my whole

699
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:44,903
[SPEAKER_01]: My home is going to be surrounded by parking.

700
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:48,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I asked him what he planned on doing about that.

701
00:56:48,244 --> 00:56:54,266
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to have stacked parking, which apparently he's never been in a garage before because he seems to think that they're not going to make any noise.

702
00:56:54,647 --> 00:56:56,847
[SPEAKER_01]: My bedroom windows are all along that side of the home.

703
00:56:57,328 --> 00:56:59,708
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to have my windows open at night on a nice day?

704
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:01,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all you're going to hear are cars coming in and out.

705
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:05,751
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to hear the garage, the lift going up and down for the stack parking that he's proposing.

706
00:57:06,751 --> 00:57:08,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the fumes from these cars are going to come in my home.

707
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:17,404
[SPEAKER_01]: His solution to that was these are going to be very expensive units, so they will be able to afford nice cars where fumes will not go into your home.

708
00:57:17,925 --> 00:57:23,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what planet he lives on, because no matter how nice your car is, fumes are going to come from it.

709
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:29,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And when my windows are open, my property from my house to that house is from me to you.

710
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:34,173
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a bunch of cars lined up out there, cars idling in the summertime,

711
00:57:34,606 --> 00:57:39,570
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep them cool before people are getting in, cars being warmed up in the wintertime, all that's going to come into my home.

712
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:41,211
[SPEAKER_01]: All those fumes are going to be in my home.

713
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:41,872
[SPEAKER_01]: What about me?

714
00:57:42,152 --> 00:57:42,992
[SPEAKER_01]: What about my kids?

715
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:44,834
[SPEAKER_01]: He has no regard for that.

716
00:57:44,914 --> 00:57:49,477
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me that he will put up some more trees, some lattice if I want.

717
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:52,140
[SPEAKER_01]: That really has not a solution to the problem.

718
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,362
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me that he would see about putting in signs that say no idling.

719
00:57:55,422 --> 00:57:58,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, okay, and who's going to monitor that and what's going to be done about it when they are idling?

720
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:02,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And he pretty much told me that that's the city's problem to deal with.

721
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:07,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has no regard as to what's going to be done or what's going to be built around us.

722
00:58:07,531 --> 00:58:22,421
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me pretty much that I should be thankful that he has dropped down a level and set back on my side where the other side will be four stories straight high and on mine it will be set back a little bit because I had complained about the height being right on the side of me being so close to us.

723
00:58:23,992 --> 00:58:33,196
[SPEAKER_01]: look from my window into the house that's currently there and see, which we did because I called him like a nice neighbor in December to let him know that his pipes burst because I could see the water in his home.

724
00:58:33,956 --> 00:58:35,197
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a discussion.

725
00:58:35,277 --> 00:58:49,863
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me that, uh, when the plans were ready, we would actually, he would bring them to us and discuss them with me before he submitted them, which lo and behold, he did not do because we found out from a neighbor that he purchased the property behind us on Everett street and will now be surrounded by his parking.

726
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:51,804
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came and viewed the plans.

727
00:58:51,964 --> 00:58:52,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I called him.

728
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:53,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent him an email.

729
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:54,687
[SPEAKER_01]: He called me back.

730
00:58:55,764 --> 00:59:01,246
[SPEAKER_01]: He had no, he just blew off everything that I had to say and was concerned about.

731
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:08,529
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he's pretty confident that this is going to pass and he doesn't have a care in the world or doesn't seem worried about what anybody else wants.

732
00:59:08,669 --> 00:59:11,190
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't care that my house is going to be surrounded by parking.

733
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:22,595
[SPEAKER_01]: He wouldn't, I was at that same meeting on Salem street and I believe if I'm not mistaken, the reason why he told us he needed to build five unit, five stories and keep the units that high is because there was a problem with the property at the break shop.

734
00:59:22,995 --> 00:59:24,857
[SPEAKER_01]: that there was some contamination or something there.

735
00:59:24,917 --> 00:59:38,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that was to make us feel guilty or not, so that way he could build as many units as he wanted, but nothing that I know of or that anybody has told me has been filed about contamination there.

736
00:59:38,887 --> 00:59:40,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does he plan on doing about that if there is?

737
00:59:41,368 --> 00:59:42,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I live right next door.

738
00:59:42,189 --> 00:59:43,110
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a school up the street.

739
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,151
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen when they start digging things up over there?

740
00:59:45,491 --> 00:59:47,593
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen when he starts digging into the ground?

741
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:49,864
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to build this big building here.

742
00:59:49,944 --> 00:59:56,149
[SPEAKER_01]: And my little house, if you look at the building and his plans, this thing is monstrous and my house is about yay big compared to it.

743
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:57,830
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's going to happen to my foundation?

744
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:00,032
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen to my house while this is all being built?

745
01:00:00,452 --> 01:00:01,012
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't care.

746
01:00:02,113 --> 01:00:06,096
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we bought that house 22 years ago, that was never a thought in our mind.

747
01:00:06,216 --> 01:00:07,677
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a two family house next door.

748
01:00:07,997 --> 01:00:11,280
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never been zoned for this monstrous building to be next door to us.

749
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,761
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it should be now.

750
01:00:14,182 --> 01:00:14,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

751
01:00:14,502 --> 01:00:16,624
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll urge your neighbors to come to the meeting.

752
01:00:16,744 --> 01:00:17,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

753
01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:18,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

754
01:00:18,425 --> 01:00:23,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

755
01:00:23,446 --> 01:00:25,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Frank Neary, Everett Street, Medford Mass.

756
01:00:26,347 --> 01:00:31,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I am one of the director butters right on Everett Street across from where this project wants to go.

757
01:00:32,008 --> 01:00:39,770
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm thankful for the council for understanding that he bought this property knowing that he could go three stories.

758
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:43,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now we've got a block of stores there and two houses.

759
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:46,512
[SPEAKER_11]: And this big developer wants to come in

760
01:00:48,108 --> 01:00:58,234
[SPEAKER_11]: take the house and back, take the property and back of the building, abutting the other house at 17 Everett Street and build this now instead of five stories, four stories.

761
01:00:59,595 --> 01:01:01,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll never see the son in front of my house.

762
01:01:02,276 --> 01:01:03,097
[SPEAKER_11]: He doesn't care.

763
01:01:03,537 --> 01:01:07,359
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to spend his money, build the complex and run out of town.

764
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,940
[SPEAKER_11]: I've lived in the city all my life.

765
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:17,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought the house to stay there and I'm hoping that the council and the board of appeals understands that

766
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:28,283
[SPEAKER_11]: These 50 or 60 more cars coming up and down the street to visit a parking on the weekends or weeknights that it's all the local residents that are going to suffer.

767
01:01:29,024 --> 01:01:30,545
[SPEAKER_11]: I've talked to many of my neighbors.

768
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,767
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of them didn't see it in the newspaper.

769
01:01:33,268 --> 01:01:34,789
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of them didn't get the notice.

770
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:36,491
[SPEAKER_11]: I made the notices.

771
01:01:36,691 --> 01:01:41,296
[SPEAKER_11]: I gave them to all my neighbors on court street, Everett street, Revere place.

772
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:58,355
[SPEAKER_11]: I will continue to give them, and I want this developer to know that the people that live in the community care what they're looking at, and not just him building a building, selling the condos, and running out of town to leave us looking at a brick building.

773
01:01:59,035 --> 01:01:59,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

774
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:00,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, sir.

775
01:02:05,377 --> 01:02:09,698
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Langaud-Guerin, roll call vote has been requested.

776
01:02:10,218 --> 01:02:11,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, could you please call the roll?

777
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:15,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo?

778
01:02:15,439 --> 01:02:15,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

779
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

780
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:17,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

781
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:18,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

782
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

783
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn?

784
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:20,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

785
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:22,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Marks?

786
01:02:23,161 --> 01:02:23,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

787
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:24,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

788
01:02:24,761 --> 01:02:25,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

789
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:26,502
[SPEAKER_04]: President Caraviello?

790
01:02:26,702 --> 01:02:26,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

791
01:02:26,962 --> 01:02:30,702
[SPEAKER_04]: The vote of seven in the positive and the negative.

792
01:02:30,802 --> 01:02:33,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

793
01:02:33,923 --> 01:02:36,044
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-039 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

794
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:43,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided with a block chart showing the Medford Public School

795
01:02:43,615 --> 01:02:47,198
[SPEAKER_04]: class size throughout our city by class and school.

796
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:56,884
[SPEAKER_04]: We had further resolved that the same as the one in the school's budget book be given to us every June.

797
01:02:57,685 --> 01:02:58,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lococo.

798
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

799
01:03:02,168 --> 01:03:07,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I asked this obviously in conjunction with, it has a lot to do with the development that's going on in the city.

800
01:03:07,932 --> 01:03:10,174
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are provided with the block chart

801
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:16,104
[SPEAKER_10]: based on, it's broken down by school, by class, how many children are in each class.

802
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:24,767
[SPEAKER_10]: We received one in June, actual numbers obviously changed tremendous, they've changed since then.

803
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:32,430
[SPEAKER_10]: So I ask that we be provided a new block chart, same as the one in the budget book, so we can see where numbers have changed.

804
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:37,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I would also amend this and just ask for a report from our superintendent of schools

805
01:03:38,343 --> 01:03:45,407
[SPEAKER_10]: just outlining which, if any, schools are at capacity so that we have a better understanding of where we're at.

806
01:03:45,567 --> 01:03:55,273
[SPEAKER_10]: From what I understand, from what I've been told just by talks within the community, two of our schools of the few are at capacity.

807
01:03:55,633 --> 01:04:03,798
[SPEAKER_10]: So which schools, if we could get a formal written update with regards to which schools are at capacity so we have a better idea.

808
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:04,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

809
01:04:04,538 --> 01:04:06,199
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Lange was amended.

810
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

811
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:08,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

812
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:13,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to thank Councilor Lungo for bringing this forward tonight.

813
01:04:14,027 --> 01:04:20,551
[SPEAKER_09]: As a former member of the school committee, I always found that this is very valuable information.

814
01:04:21,131 --> 01:04:25,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because you know where the hot spots are, if class size is getting too big or not.

815
01:04:25,614 --> 01:04:32,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I know when I did talk to a member of the school committee back in, I think, December or November, class size seemed to be reasonable.

816
01:04:34,062 --> 01:04:36,663
[SPEAKER_09]: class size changes a lot throughout the year.

817
01:04:36,703 --> 01:04:38,704
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something that a lot of people don't realize.

818
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:53,931
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it would be great to get that every June, but if I may amend the resolution just to see if we could also get a copy of this every October, November as well, just to see how it's growing throughout the school year.

819
01:04:54,371 --> 01:04:58,093
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very important information and it is important to look at this on an ongoing basis.

820
01:04:58,153 --> 01:04:59,054
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

821
01:05:00,373 --> 01:05:01,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Longo-Kurtz.

822
01:05:01,573 --> 01:05:02,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I just would back that up.

823
01:05:02,634 --> 01:05:06,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes we're given updates and it's based on averages.

824
01:05:06,415 --> 01:05:08,496
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why I asked for a block chart.

825
01:05:09,216 --> 01:05:12,477
[SPEAKER_10]: The blocks tell you which schools are kind of running over those classes.

826
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:18,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're allowed by contract up to 26, 27, I believe, children per teacher.

827
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:21,760
[SPEAKER_10]: But we obviously want much lower class size than that.

828
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:27,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And from what I'm hearing, some classes are 16, 17, 18, where you have other classes that are at the 24, 25 mark.

829
01:05:28,936 --> 01:05:39,063
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need to, we need to have a better understanding of that for our community meeting and, and just in general so that we can see where we're moving, where, how we're going to move forward.

830
01:05:39,723 --> 01:05:42,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I, I appreciate the council support.

831
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:42,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

832
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:47,209
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion as amended by council, I'm going to occur in council effect.

833
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:51,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Falco roll call vote has been requested.

834
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:51,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk.

835
01:05:55,274 --> 01:05:56,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo.

836
01:05:57,376 --> 01:05:58,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

837
01:05:58,875 --> 01:05:59,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

838
01:05:59,575 --> 01:05:59,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

839
01:06:00,196 --> 01:06:00,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn?

840
01:06:00,996 --> 01:06:01,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

841
01:06:01,597 --> 01:06:02,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Marks?

842
01:06:02,857 --> 01:06:03,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

843
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:03,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

844
01:06:04,018 --> 01:06:04,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

845
01:06:04,978 --> 01:06:05,719
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello?

846
01:06:05,759 --> 01:06:08,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

847
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:11,902
[SPEAKER_04]: 7-0, motion passes.

848
01:06:11,922 --> 01:06:24,069
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-040, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be updated with regards to discussions on charging a sewer connection fee for new construction.

849
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:25,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

850
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

851
01:06:29,398 --> 01:06:32,400
[SPEAKER_10]: The issue come forward tomorrow night and next Tuesday.

852
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:33,901
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's been a lot of discussion.

853
01:06:33,961 --> 01:06:39,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I've received a lot of input with regards to how people feel about the development on Salem Street.

854
01:06:39,725 --> 01:06:51,572
[SPEAKER_10]: And one thing that I've been able to discuss with a number of residents is because residents feel like we cater to developers rather than, you know, do what's right for the community.

855
01:06:51,992 --> 01:06:55,154
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing that did come up is a sewer connection fee.

856
01:06:56,295 --> 01:06:58,236
[SPEAKER_10]: The city of Cambridge is a good example.

857
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:04,035
[SPEAKER_10]: And they established a City of Cambridge sanitary sewer connection fee.

858
01:07:04,095 --> 01:07:08,116
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you don't mind if I take a read, I think it's something important.

859
01:07:08,136 --> 01:07:14,779
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's something we can send to the administration to see if it's worthwhile implementing in the community.

860
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,581
[SPEAKER_10]: We have every department.

861
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:21,302
[SPEAKER_10]: I mentioned fire and police understaffed, DPW.

862
01:07:21,362 --> 01:07:22,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I mentioned that previously.

863
01:07:22,963 --> 01:07:27,865
[SPEAKER_10]: But we also have almost every department in City Hall understaffed.

864
01:07:28,262 --> 01:07:54,892
[SPEAKER_10]: We met with John Babuso tonight, our code enforcement officer, with regards to enforcing an ordinance that we're going to implement from Councilor Falco, Scarpelli and I, our ad hoc education committee, and we're going to be getting, it's not really relevant, but we're going to be getting updates from Tufts and the education communities, and we're going to be able to find out which units are housing more than three unrelated people.

865
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:59,006
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we tried to ask John if he could start enforcing that, his head was spinning.

866
01:07:59,146 --> 01:08:02,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, no, I'm just going to use this as a tool for complaints.

867
01:08:02,589 --> 01:08:08,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, no, we want your department more staff so we can enforce the ordinances we have.

868
01:08:09,013 --> 01:08:12,736
[SPEAKER_10]: We need, you know, obviously need money coming into the community for certain things.

869
01:08:12,836 --> 01:08:20,182
[SPEAKER_10]: And this sewer connection fee is an example of something that will help us with our infrastructure problems.

870
01:08:20,538 --> 01:08:25,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's something that I think the city of Medford should, if we, I tried to look, I could not find that we've ever implemented it.

871
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:29,442
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't recall ever implementing it in my 15 plus years.

872
01:08:29,882 --> 01:08:33,584
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's something that we need to move to the administration.

873
01:08:34,384 --> 01:08:46,290
[SPEAKER_10]: The city of Cambridge says, whereas much of the sewer system must be carefully reviewed for approval because of the environmental effects of adding to the sewer volume overflow potential, potential of undesirable waste products.

874
01:08:46,734 --> 01:09:11,832
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas much of the sewer system of the city of Cambridge was built when the pressures for connections were not as great, and whereas the city must expend time, money, and effort in determining the need and suitability for additional sewer connections, it is hereby established by the Commissioner of Public Works, under their authorization granted, that the following one-time sewer connection fee charge shall be in effect as of the dates of this order.

875
01:09:12,172 --> 01:09:16,355
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it charges a certain amount of money per units that are being built.

876
01:09:16,825 --> 01:09:19,986
[SPEAKER_10]: And it does increase by each additional unit.

877
01:09:20,326 --> 01:09:22,747
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's something that's necessary.

878
01:09:22,807 --> 01:09:34,992
[SPEAKER_10]: When I was at the engineer's office speaking to, I believe, an assistant engineer, just reviewing the plans takes time from our OCD office, our engineering office.

879
01:09:35,312 --> 01:09:44,575
[SPEAKER_10]: And our engineering office has to evaluate all these sewer lines and make sure we're capable of taking on 21 units or not taking on 21 units.

880
01:09:44,656 --> 01:09:45,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's something that could go

881
01:09:47,665 --> 01:09:56,231
[SPEAKER_10]: the funds collected from these connection charges in Cambridge shall be deposited to that portion of the city accounts used to finance sewer maintenance costs.

882
01:09:56,712 --> 01:10:01,375
[SPEAKER_10]: So not only is it gonna boost up the general fund, it's gonna help with the issues we have.

883
01:10:01,735 --> 01:10:07,119
[SPEAKER_10]: We have sewer issues, we have piping issues, and those need to be corrected.

884
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,200
[SPEAKER_10]: We need money to do it.

885
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:15,485
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a no-brainer and something that should be implemented, so I would ask my colleagues to support this being looked at by our engineer,

886
01:10:17,096 --> 01:10:20,839
[SPEAKER_10]: by our administration and something that move forward as soon as possible.

887
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:22,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilwoman.

888
01:10:22,961 --> 01:10:23,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

889
01:10:24,242 --> 01:10:28,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I find this to be a creative way to generate non-tax revenue.

890
01:10:28,605 --> 01:10:29,586
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a great idea.

891
01:10:29,826 --> 01:10:32,048
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's something that's feasibility needs to be examined.

892
01:10:32,068 --> 01:10:33,629
[SPEAKER_16]: I move for approval and request a roll call vote.

893
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:38,393
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion, Councilor Marks.

894
01:10:39,674 --> 01:10:40,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

895
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:45,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was probably about three or four weeks ago we were discussing water and sewer.

896
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:54,555
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, we had a presentation, uh, at a meeting that, uh, the mayor held regarding, um, uh, the water and sewer system.

897
01:10:55,396 --> 01:11:15,128
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the time I brought up an issue that I happened to have a discussion with someone, uh, very knowledgeable in the community and that, uh, it's possible that the water, uh, and sewer board, um, is looking at, uh,

898
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:25,063
[SPEAKER_15]: potentially a connection, a sewer charging every resident, whether it's new construction or existing construction, a sewer charge.

899
01:11:26,303 --> 01:11:44,050
[SPEAKER_15]: And I haven't heard the full facts or figures on it, but I would be, and I know what Councilor Lungo-Koehn's going after with this, I would be very hesitant myself, and I can't support this tonight, going forward with any type of connection charge, because that may lead to

900
01:11:44,803 --> 01:11:54,611
[SPEAKER_15]: a connection charge for existing homeowners, you know, to be hooked up, because the way I understand it, there are other communities that have a connection fee.

901
01:11:55,171 --> 01:12:01,596
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is a connection fee, and not for new construction, just a connection fee.

902
01:12:02,037 --> 01:12:03,458
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that.

903
01:12:03,738 --> 01:12:04,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that.

904
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:12,745
[SPEAKER_15]: And it might be a foot in the door to lead to residential and existing construction.

905
01:12:13,467 --> 01:12:18,230
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not saying that's what Councilor Lungo was going after, because I know it's not what she's going after.

906
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:25,853
[SPEAKER_15]: But I heard from a valid source sometime back that they're looking at a connection fee for all homes in the city.

907
01:12:26,534 --> 01:12:29,876
[SPEAKER_15]: And I am adamantly opposed to that, Mr. President.

908
01:12:29,896 --> 01:12:37,820
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if we want to hold off on this, but I can't support this tonight, even though in theory, in concept, it sounds great, Mr. President.

909
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,382
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very concerned about a potential connection fee

910
01:12:42,768 --> 01:12:46,389
[SPEAKER_15]: for all residents of this community, which concerns me, Mr. President.

911
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:47,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Martz.

912
01:12:48,009 --> 01:12:48,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Dello Russo.

913
01:12:49,289 --> 01:12:55,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to point out that Cambridge doesn't have a linkage fee and we do for development.

914
01:12:55,811 --> 01:12:57,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that information, Councilor Dello Russo.

915
01:12:58,211 --> 01:13:00,112
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

916
01:13:00,912 --> 01:13:01,612
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

917
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:02,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

918
01:13:03,232 --> 01:13:05,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Scarpelli.

919
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:06,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Martz.

920
01:13:07,913 --> 01:13:11,154
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could be recorded in opposition

921
01:13:11,908 --> 01:13:29,762
[SPEAKER_15]: based on the fact that I think I would like to see a response back from our water and sewer commissioners, whether or not they're looking into a sewer connection fee for residential and business entities, if they are reviewing that right now.

922
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:31,924
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why I'm opposed to this right now.

923
01:13:31,944 --> 01:13:32,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

924
01:13:32,304 --> 01:13:33,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lango-Curran.

925
01:13:36,248 --> 01:13:40,291
[SPEAKER_10]: But they wouldn't be responsible for the sewer connection fees for new development.

926
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:45,716
[SPEAKER_10]: or they're just proposing it for residential and business?

927
01:13:45,776 --> 01:13:46,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what you've heard?

928
01:13:46,476 --> 01:13:47,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't heard any of that.

929
01:13:47,877 --> 01:13:52,419
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I... I think we shouldn't talk on things we don't know about until we know about them.

930
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:56,281
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm looking to maybe... We always talk about things.

931
01:13:56,561 --> 01:13:56,681
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

932
01:13:58,182 --> 01:14:02,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm looking at the possibility of maybe amending this somehow to get input.

933
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:04,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's what we're looking to do.

934
01:14:04,585 --> 01:14:08,346
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get input from the Water Commission if you so like.

935
01:14:08,606 --> 01:14:09,627
[SPEAKER_10]: But I definitely think...

936
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:18,515
[SPEAKER_10]: new development should be, it should be looked into for a connection fee for new construction of whether we put it as five units or more.

937
01:14:18,615 --> 01:14:22,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean some, something, some sort of connection fee for the heavy burden.

938
01:14:23,599 --> 01:14:25,862
[SPEAKER_10]: These large developments are put in on our infrastructure.

939
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:34,590
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's a bad idea, but back two years ago we created a rate system.

940
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:42,900
[SPEAKER_15]: So any large developments like Budweiser or Lawrence Memorial Hospital, they pay a higher rate for their water and sewer.

941
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,042
[SPEAKER_15]: So right now, and that's a burden on the infrastructure.

942
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:47,303
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not opposed to this.

943
01:14:47,323 --> 01:14:55,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, I just, you know, from the conversation I had a while back regarding that connection, and that's all it was, was a conversation.

944
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:57,491
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not too happy with that.

945
01:14:57,531 --> 01:15:04,476
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's, I'm not going to support anything right now that talks about a connection fee, whether it's new construction or not.

946
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:06,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

947
01:15:06,821 --> 01:15:12,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, Mr. President, as the debate wages on and I read the language of the resolution, it says, be it resolved.

948
01:15:12,585 --> 01:15:17,529
[SPEAKER_16]: The city council will be updated with regards to discussions on charging a sewer connection fee for new construction.

949
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:26,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I think Councilor Marks has pointed out that there have been discussions about charging sewer connection fees for also, uh, residences that wouldn't be under new construction.

950
01:15:27,216 --> 01:15:32,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I think that we're all on the same page that we want to be updated as to whether or not they are talking about sewer connection fees in one way or another.

951
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:48,144
[SPEAKER_16]: If we strike the language for new construction and we ask that the administration update us with regards to discussions on charging a sewer connection fee, I may be so bold as to suggest that that might satisfy all parties and we'd be able to get an answer from the administration on this and I'll show a unified front.

952
01:15:49,404 --> 01:15:50,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fine with that.

953
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:55,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would appease everybody and we can talk about new construction down the line.

954
01:15:55,326 --> 01:15:59,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you can get an update from the administration and from the water and sewer commission.

955
01:16:01,784 --> 01:16:06,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd like to know any discussions that are taking place if we're, if it's coming down the line, cause we need to.

956
01:16:08,066 --> 01:16:17,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So the motion will read, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be updated with regards to discussions on the charging of water, charging of a sewer connection fee for all construction.

957
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:27,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, just charging a sewer connection fee from, from the water and sewer commission administration period.

958
01:16:32,377 --> 01:16:35,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion, excuse me, Councilor Knight.

959
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:37,978
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that was it, Mr. President.

960
01:16:39,758 --> 01:16:42,159
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, all those in favor?

961
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:43,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

962
01:16:44,019 --> 01:16:45,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed?

963
01:16:45,339 --> 01:16:48,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Knight.

964
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

965
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:51,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor De La Russa?

966
01:16:53,201 --> 01:16:53,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

967
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:54,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

968
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:55,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

969
01:16:55,581 --> 01:16:56,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

970
01:16:56,201 --> 01:16:56,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

971
01:16:57,281 --> 01:16:58,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn?

972
01:16:58,302 --> 01:16:58,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

973
01:16:59,002 --> 01:16:59,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Marks?

974
01:17:00,002 --> 01:17:00,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

975
01:17:03,704 --> 01:17:03,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

976
01:17:05,005 --> 01:17:08,566
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 in the permanent motion passes.

977
01:17:08,586 --> 01:17:11,448
[SPEAKER_04]: 1 7 0 4 1 offered by council and go current.

978
01:17:11,548 --> 01:17:20,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Be a resolved that the Medford city council receive an itemized breakdown of how chapter 90 funding has been spent over the last four years.

979
01:17:21,212 --> 01:17:22,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor.

980
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:22,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

981
01:17:22,873 --> 01:17:23,853
[SPEAKER_10]: President Caraviello.

982
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:28,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, within our time during budget during budget,

983
01:17:28,934 --> 01:17:36,759
[SPEAKER_10]: hearings, especially we hear bits and pieces of how chapter 90 funding is being where it's being applied.

984
01:17:36,779 --> 01:17:50,428
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also hear how it's going to be applied down the road, but we've never actually got a breakdown with regards to how much has been brought in per year and where exactly those funds have gone that I can recall.

985
01:17:50,508 --> 01:17:58,333
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we could get an update broken down over the last four years, how much has come into the city, maybe amended to ask how much has come in,

986
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:04,765
[SPEAKER_10]: each year, where it's been, and which projects, just listed out by project, where it's been spent.

987
01:18:05,966 --> 01:18:11,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important for the council to understand how much we're getting each year and where it's being spent.

988
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:12,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilwoman O'Kurin.

989
01:18:13,133 --> 01:18:14,414
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilwoman O'Kurin.

990
01:18:14,654 --> 01:18:15,115
Move approval.

991
01:18:15,135 --> 01:18:15,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval.

992
01:18:15,996 --> 01:18:16,616
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

993
01:18:17,437 --> 01:18:17,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

994
01:18:17,937 --> 01:18:18,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

995
01:18:18,678 --> 01:18:18,698
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-042.

996
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:30,933
[SPEAKER_04]: offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the city upgrade all street lights citywide with new improved energy efficient LED lights.

997
01:18:31,534 --> 01:18:38,677
[SPEAKER_04]: This will not only enhance the lighting in many of our neighborhoods and business districts, but will provide a great savings to the city's electric bill.

998
01:18:38,717 --> 01:18:45,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks, if you notice in our package this evening, there is a letter here from the mayor explaining that.

999
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:47,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I had the opportunity

1000
01:18:48,382 --> 01:18:51,284
[SPEAKER_04]: to speak to National Grid on Saturday at the MMA show.

1001
01:18:52,064 --> 01:18:57,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And the gentleman told me that they do have a program to upgrade all the lights in the city to LEDs.

1002
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:01,208
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Councilman, Councilman Marks.

1003
01:19:02,909 --> 01:19:03,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1004
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:17,375
[SPEAKER_15]: I offer this resolution, Mr. President, because we all know we're moving forward with the LED lights in the square, which has been a long and arduous process, upgrading the lighting in the square in our business districts.

1005
01:19:18,062 --> 01:19:18,943
[SPEAKER_15]: throughout the community.

1006
01:19:19,864 --> 01:19:25,729
[SPEAKER_15]: The next logical step is to look into major thoroughfares in our neighborhoods.

1007
01:19:26,349 --> 01:19:36,578
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would ask anyone to go into any neighborhood, and you'll see poorly lit streets right now, Mr. President, of which a very small percentage.

1008
01:19:36,999 --> 01:19:45,606
[SPEAKER_15]: From what I spoke to the head of wires recently, we have maybe 1 or 2 percent LED lights throughout the city.

1009
01:19:47,044 --> 01:19:47,524
[SPEAKER_15]: in total.

1010
01:19:48,325 --> 01:20:00,052
[SPEAKER_15]: And the LED lights, as we know, sheds more light down onto the street, where the current lighting is more focused at a higher level, which doesn't help the street light.

1011
01:20:00,893 --> 01:20:05,956
[SPEAKER_15]: And it also lasts a lot longer than the regular lights that exist right now.

1012
01:20:06,476 --> 01:20:14,141
[SPEAKER_15]: There are over 5,000 street lights in the community right now, and our yearly electric bill is about $900,000 a year.

1013
01:20:16,588 --> 01:20:37,043
[SPEAKER_15]: From what I've been told, and this is somewhat of an aggressive estimate, if we were to change over to LED lights, as a community, there's a potential savings of up to 70 percent in our yearly electrical bill, which would amount to about $630,000 savings, Mr. President.

1014
01:20:37,423 --> 01:20:45,009
[SPEAKER_15]: If you told any resident, if they changed over in their home to LED lights, which I would recommend, and they could see a savings of 70 percent,

1015
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:49,671
[SPEAKER_15]: I think everyone would say that's a no-brainer and we have to move forward.

1016
01:20:50,872 --> 01:20:55,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Additionally, the benefits, like I said, is extra lighting on the street level, which we can use.

1017
01:20:55,853 --> 01:20:57,254
[SPEAKER_15]: It helps with crime prevention.

1018
01:20:57,574 --> 01:20:58,794
[SPEAKER_15]: It helps with public safety.

1019
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:03,936
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a number of reasons why you want to change over to LED lights.

1020
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:11,559
[SPEAKER_15]: We did receive, as you said, Mr. President, a response January 24th regarding my paper, 17042.

1021
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:17,844
[SPEAKER_15]: And it looks like the city has started the process in August of 2016.

1022
01:21:19,345 --> 01:21:21,147
[SPEAKER_15]: They submitted RFPs.

1023
01:21:21,547 --> 01:21:23,869
[SPEAKER_15]: They started the process going, Mr. President.

1024
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:31,075
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would say this resolution is just to go on board, because I haven't been privy to any of that information.

1025
01:21:31,436 --> 01:21:35,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe members of the council are aware of this initiative that the city's moving forward.

1026
01:21:35,999 --> 01:21:37,661
[SPEAKER_15]: But I certainly have not heard anything.

1027
01:21:38,081 --> 01:21:41,244
[SPEAKER_15]: And over the years, I know Councilor Penta that's here tonight in the audience,

1028
01:21:41,567 --> 01:21:48,352
[SPEAKER_15]: We've brought up these issues year after year after year, and I never once heard the administration say, hey, wait a minute, we're moving forward.

1029
01:21:49,032 --> 01:21:50,173
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a program right now.

1030
01:21:50,213 --> 01:21:51,934
[SPEAKER_15]: We're sending out an RFP.

1031
01:21:51,954 --> 01:21:53,115
[SPEAKER_15]: We're moving forward on the issue.

1032
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:56,977
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm glad to hear the city is moving forward, Mr. President.

1033
01:21:57,378 --> 01:21:59,219
[SPEAKER_15]: It's long overdue in this community.

1034
01:21:59,939 --> 01:22:08,565
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would ask, Mr. President, that we send by a roll call vote, Mr. President, a communication back to the administration

1035
01:22:08,988 --> 01:22:12,170
[SPEAKER_15]: that we're wholeheartedly in support of moving forward on this.

1036
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:21,114
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we all have to keep in mind, too, that right now, when we call for a light that's out, National Grid comes and changes the light.

1037
01:22:22,255 --> 01:22:29,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Under this new program, when we change to LED, no longer will National Grid be responsible for changing those lights.

1038
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,761
[SPEAKER_15]: It would either be the city or a contractor hired by the city.

1039
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:37,743
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a major change, Mr. President.

1040
01:22:39,203 --> 01:22:44,946
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, National Grid is not in the business of providing cheaper electricity.

1041
01:22:46,026 --> 01:22:52,449
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you hear a lot of talk from, you know, the governor's office and all the different environmental offices.

1042
01:22:53,209 --> 01:23:01,153
[SPEAKER_15]: If National Grid wanted to take a step forward, this should be their initiative for local cities and towns to change over to LED.

1043
01:23:01,973 --> 01:23:08,236
[SPEAKER_15]: And let me tell you, LED maybe in a year or two will be outdated, but it's where everyone is going now.

1044
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:29,133
[SPEAKER_15]: So National Grid's not gonna try to save us money on our electricity bill, and I think it's prudent of the city to move forward, Mr. President, on this initiative and provide a cost savings to the taxpayers of this community, as well as enhance lighting throughout our entire city, not just in the business district, but in our neighborhoods and on our thoroughfares.

1045
01:23:29,434 --> 01:23:30,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1046
01:23:30,414 --> 01:23:33,397
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, roll call vote has been requested.

1047
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks has requested a roll call vote.

1048
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:41,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

1049
01:23:41,748 --> 01:23:45,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Jay Griffin, Adobe Glen Lane, Bethune, Mass.

1050
01:23:46,029 --> 01:23:46,569
[SPEAKER_13]: One question.

1051
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:48,790
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a good move to go to LED.

1052
01:23:50,471 --> 01:23:56,633
[SPEAKER_13]: At one time in the Royal Park, there were two lights shining on the Royal Mansion.

1053
01:23:58,274 --> 01:24:00,555
[SPEAKER_13]: When they did the energy measures, they cut the lights.

1054
01:24:01,455 --> 01:24:06,737
[SPEAKER_13]: There are no lights at all shining on the Royal House from Main Street.

1055
01:24:08,114 --> 01:24:10,416
[SPEAKER_13]: A, it's a security problem.

1056
01:24:11,256 --> 01:24:13,358
[SPEAKER_13]: The fence is in tough shape right now.

1057
01:24:14,398 --> 01:24:21,323
[SPEAKER_13]: The city saw fit to cut off the two gates because the right pilaster made of brick is actually going to fall eventually.

1058
01:24:22,004 --> 01:24:24,105
[SPEAKER_13]: So some attention has to be paid to the park.

1059
01:24:24,145 --> 01:24:33,352
[SPEAKER_13]: But putting two LED lights to shine up the most architecturally important building in the city of Medford is something that was done in the past.

1060
01:24:34,336 --> 01:24:36,777
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we're derelict not lighting it up now.

1061
01:24:37,658 --> 01:24:40,219
[SPEAKER_13]: That building is worth more than any other building in the city.

1062
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:41,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Griffin.

1063
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:42,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1064
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:45,622
[SPEAKER_04]: You make that part of the committee?

1065
01:24:45,662 --> 01:24:49,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address of the record, please.

1066
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,946
[SPEAKER_12]: Robert Pantaleo, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

1067
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:53,186
[SPEAKER_12]: A quick question.

1068
01:24:53,847 --> 01:24:55,928
[SPEAKER_12]: The contract that the city of Medford has with Republic

1069
01:24:56,692 --> 01:25:00,653
[SPEAKER_12]: has an inclusion there on an annual basis of $250,000 is supposed to go back to this.

1070
01:25:00,673 --> 01:25:01,813
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not have an inclusion of $250,000.

1071
01:25:01,873 --> 01:25:02,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Pardon me?

1072
01:25:03,233 --> 01:25:07,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not have an inclusion that 250,000 goes back to the community.

1073
01:25:08,274 --> 01:25:11,495
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a one-time payment.

1074
01:25:11,575 --> 01:25:12,835
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if you read the contract, it says it.

1075
01:25:12,855 --> 01:25:15,576
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a one-time payment put in by then Mayor McGlynn.

1076
01:25:15,656 --> 01:25:16,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1077
01:25:16,816 --> 01:25:18,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say one time.

1078
01:25:18,676 --> 01:25:19,816
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not carry forward.

1079
01:25:19,976 --> 01:25:21,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the word is annual, Rick.

1080
01:25:21,537 --> 01:25:22,617
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not say the word annual.

1081
01:25:23,352 --> 01:25:26,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I would question the fact whether it's annual or not, so we won't dispute that.

1082
01:25:26,974 --> 01:25:31,736
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact of the matter is $250,000 was supposed to come back to cities and towns.

1083
01:25:31,856 --> 01:25:33,096
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is there in accounts.

1084
01:25:33,697 --> 01:25:34,617
[SPEAKER_12]: But what's it being used for?

1085
01:25:34,877 --> 01:25:38,259
[SPEAKER_12]: It can be used for the lakes, the Council of Lakes is alluding to.

1086
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:45,021
[SPEAKER_16]: If we look at the papers that remain on the table, I believe that was one of the papers that remained on the table from the 2015 session.

1087
01:25:45,081 --> 01:25:46,542
[SPEAKER_16]: It has not been decided what to do with the $250,000.

1088
01:25:48,923 --> 01:26:01,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilmarks, can it be recommended to Councilmarks, since it's gonna cost us money to save money, that that money come from that particular account, since his resolution, I'm assuming, is a citywide, has a citywide impact?

1089
01:26:01,832 --> 01:26:05,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if, that money was not, I don't think that money was earmarked.

1090
01:26:06,196 --> 01:26:07,336
[SPEAKER_04]: It's earmarked for the squares.

1091
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:09,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It was earmarked for the business areas.

1092
01:26:09,818 --> 01:26:11,199
[SPEAKER_12]: For the five business districts.

1093
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,602
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have a right to be included in the LED approval.

1094
01:26:15,622 --> 01:26:16,443
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, thank you.

1095
01:26:22,394 --> 01:26:23,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

1096
01:26:23,755 --> 01:26:24,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, just one quick point.

1097
01:26:25,036 --> 01:26:26,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

1098
01:26:27,538 --> 01:26:40,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Just talking about lighting, I'm hoping that we're gonna have some softer LED lighting for the neighborhoods, that we're not gonna have the harsh lights of the square in people's residential areas, just something to consider, we don't wanna add noise pollution to the neighborhoods.

1099
01:26:41,167 --> 01:26:43,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what kind of lights they are going to be putting.

1100
01:26:44,289 --> 01:26:44,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1101
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:51,214
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, roll call vote has been requested.

1102

[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello.

1116
01:27:08,025 --> 01:27:08,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1117
01:27:08,706 --> 01:27:10,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for suspension by Councilor Knight.

1120
01:27:17,092 --> 01:27:17,692
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

01:27:18,093 --> 01:27:18,193
Aye.

1122
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:19,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1123
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:21,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1124
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:23,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Hands of the clerk.

1125
01:27:24,652 --> 01:27:32,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that Medford City Council rescind Council Vote 17-0-22.

1126
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:44,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that the following language be included in the committee report under section 90-34, where it says, those owning or operating

1127
01:27:47,214 --> 01:27:59,741
[SPEAKER_04]: More than five taxi cabs shall own or operate at least one taxi cab that complies with the definition of an accessible vehicle as defined in chapter 90 dash 31 of the committee report.

1128
01:27:59,801 --> 01:28:00,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1129
01:28:01,061 --> 01:28:12,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, this is a paper relative to the work that our subcommittee has done in the committee of the whole has done to transfer the licensing authority from the city council to the police department relative to taxi cab licensure.

1130
01:28:13,088 --> 01:28:13,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Um,

1131
01:28:13,978 --> 01:28:25,802
[SPEAKER_16]: The matter was vetted through subcommittee process and through committee of the whole process, and there was much discussion relative to the issue of providing accessible vehicles to individuals in the community when seeking a taxi cab ride.

1132
01:28:26,042 --> 01:28:28,403
[SPEAKER_16]: And this was an issue that was championed by Councilor Marks.

1133
01:28:28,783 --> 01:28:30,344
[SPEAKER_16]: We had much back and forth on the topic.

1134
01:28:31,384 --> 01:28:36,806
[SPEAKER_16]: We proposed a resolution, I'm sorry, we proposed an ordinance change, and the ordinance change was included in the committee report.

1135
01:28:37,246 --> 01:28:39,227
[SPEAKER_16]: That committee report was adopted by the council.

1136
01:28:39,878 --> 01:28:47,221
[SPEAKER_16]: The administration received a copy of the committee report and has proposed a recommendation to make an alteration to the committee report.

1137
01:28:48,081 --> 01:28:52,663
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a veto on a paper that hasn't made it to her desk quite yet, Mr. President.

1138
01:28:52,903 --> 01:28:54,203
[SPEAKER_16]: The paper hasn't made first reading.

1139
01:28:55,064 --> 01:29:03,547
[SPEAKER_16]: So this amendment in the committee report would require all taxicab companies that own or operate more than five taxicabs to purchase an accessible vehicle.

1140
01:29:03,907 --> 01:29:07,208
[SPEAKER_16]: The language in the proposed ordinance change right now says that

1141
01:29:08,567 --> 01:29:21,573
[SPEAKER_16]: all taxi cab companies have to file a paratransit plan with the office of, uh, diversity and disability to ensure that those in our community that are disabled have the ability to access a paratransit.

1142
01:29:22,213 --> 01:29:23,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, this goes above and beyond that.

1143
01:29:23,874 --> 01:29:28,356
[SPEAKER_16]: It says that anybody that has one will be required to put the paratransit plan on file.

1144
01:29:28,736 --> 01:29:31,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Anybody that has more, five or more will be required to purchase the vehicle.

1145
01:29:32,398 --> 01:29:36,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, this is something that really council max, as I remember it,

1146
01:29:36,753 --> 01:29:41,335
[SPEAKER_16]: was something that he was supporting through the measure, and it died on the table and came back.

1147
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's going to be facing a veto of the administration.

1148
01:29:44,416 --> 01:29:45,716
[SPEAKER_16]: There was some discussion back and forth.

1149
01:29:45,736 --> 01:29:46,917
[SPEAKER_16]: It's something that I believe in.

1150
01:29:47,157 --> 01:29:49,097
[SPEAKER_16]: My mind's been changed on the topic, Mr. President.

1151
01:29:49,137 --> 01:29:57,180
[SPEAKER_16]: We have about 13 to 14 percent of our community self-identifies as disabled, and if those individuals can't get access to a taxi cab, then I don't think we're doing our job.

1152
01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:05,303
[SPEAKER_16]: So, with that being said, Mr. President, I move to rescind the vote to include this language so that we can pass the ordinance change, and we can do it absent a veto from the administration.

1153
01:30:06,352 --> 01:30:07,473
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Knight.

1154
01:30:07,893 --> 01:30:12,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but Mr. Claire, in my reiteration, I don't want to speak for Councilor Marks.

1155
01:30:12,417 --> 01:30:14,779
[SPEAKER_16]: If this is, this is in fact something that he does support.

1156
01:30:14,799 --> 01:30:15,899
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to put words in his mouth.

1157
01:30:15,919 --> 01:30:17,741
[SPEAKER_16]: That was my reiteration of how I recall it happening.

1158
01:30:18,201 --> 01:30:22,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, however, if the gentleman does want to speak on the topic, uh, by all means be my guest.

1159
01:30:22,304 --> 01:30:24,526
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize if I feel as though I did put words in your mouth.

1160
01:30:25,387 --> 01:30:25,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

1161
01:30:26,648 --> 01:30:34,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Just if I could, I'm not a member of the subcommittee that worked so diligent on this, Mr. President, but I think it was less than two weeks ago we had,

1162
01:30:35,113 --> 01:30:36,893
[SPEAKER_15]: a pretty lengthy discussion on this.

1163
01:30:37,634 --> 01:30:39,054
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wasn't a voting member.

1164
01:30:39,094 --> 01:30:40,874
[SPEAKER_15]: There's only three members that sat on that committee.

1165
01:30:40,954 --> 01:30:48,256
[SPEAKER_15]: But the language that was reported out was unanimous at the time of the three members to send this paper out.

1166
01:30:48,796 --> 01:31:00,558
[SPEAKER_15]: And from what I recall, Mr. President, originally, the language stated that it was only a paratransit plan was needed if you had planned if you had five or more vehicles.

1167
01:31:01,478 --> 01:31:04,559
[SPEAKER_15]: So someone that had one vehicle wasn't required to file

1168
01:31:05,796 --> 01:31:06,516
[SPEAKER_15]: a transit plan.

1169
01:31:07,156 --> 01:31:17,322
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the time, we said, and I think the clerk agreed, that we had no taxi operators in the city that had more than five vehicles.

1170
01:31:17,883 --> 01:31:28,129
[SPEAKER_15]: So we were passing a city ordinance that doesn't really help those that need the help of assistance in getting a cab that's handicap accessible, Mr. President.

1171
01:31:28,496 --> 01:31:32,858
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why I think the members of the committee did our due diligence that night.

1172
01:31:32,898 --> 01:31:42,962
[SPEAKER_15]: We went back and forth and we agreed to remove the number of five and state that anyone that had a cab had to submit a paratransit plan.

1173
01:31:43,302 --> 01:31:54,747
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we asked that it be sent to Diane McLeod, uh, in our office of, um, diversity, um, and compliance and, uh, or the police department, uh, one or the other.

1174
01:31:55,367 --> 01:31:55,747
[SPEAKER_15]: And that,

1175
01:31:56,208 --> 01:32:12,788
[SPEAKER_15]: That plan would require taxi operators that were unable to accommodate someone with a specific disability to have a company that they use that they could say, I'm sorry, I can't accommodate you, but if you call this number, they can accommodate you.

1176
01:32:13,248 --> 01:32:16,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Rather than just saying, sorry, I can't accommodate you, and hang up.

1177
01:32:16,817 --> 01:32:24,383
[SPEAKER_15]: And the language that was in there said you had to have more than five vehicles to have a plan, and none of our carriers had more than five vehicles.

1178
01:32:24,423 --> 01:32:26,384
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that was the reason for the move.

1179
01:32:26,864 --> 01:32:39,794
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't support the language that would state that cabs over five vehicles have to get, because we were told that it's about a $40,000 expense.

1180
01:32:40,414 --> 01:32:42,736
[SPEAKER_15]: You might know $50,000 expense.

1181
01:32:42,796 --> 01:32:44,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, the T is running a program that would

1182
01:32:45,105 --> 01:32:47,366
[SPEAKER_04]: hopefully reimburse these companies at 80 percent.

1183
01:32:48,207 --> 01:32:48,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1184
01:32:48,767 --> 01:32:54,270
[SPEAKER_15]: And at any time, we can amend our ordinance, if that's the case, Mr. President, to include it.

1185
01:32:54,811 --> 01:32:57,052
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't support that language right now.

1186
01:32:57,092 --> 01:33:02,675
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the language that we thoughtfully considered at the time of the many, many subcommittees.

1187
01:33:02,996 --> 01:33:08,579
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank this committee because this has been an issue that's been lingering around the council for many, many years.

1188
01:33:08,979 --> 01:33:10,080
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank the council.

1189
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:13,682
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this was a real step in the right direction to put some ownership

1190
01:33:14,086 --> 01:33:19,289
[SPEAKER_15]: and the taxi licenses with the police department where rightfully, uh, is, uh, deserves to be.

1191
01:33:19,309 --> 01:33:21,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And excuse me, excuse me, Councilor Marks.

1192
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:25,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Castagnetti, we can't hear if you could sit down, please.

1193
01:33:25,372 --> 01:33:26,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1194
01:33:26,092 --> 01:33:26,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1195
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:28,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1196
01:33:28,093 --> 01:33:28,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Council marks.

1197
01:33:30,595 --> 01:33:32,996
[SPEAKER_15]: So, so Mr. President, um, so,

1198
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:41,892
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't support, first of all, I don't think the mayor has the authority on a committee report to veto a committee report.

1199
01:33:42,652 --> 01:33:46,373
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd never heard of that before, but that might be a new parliamentary procedure that.

1200
01:33:47,933 --> 01:33:50,994
[SPEAKER_16]: And I checked into that very same issue, because that was my question.

1201
01:33:51,154 --> 01:33:53,795
[SPEAKER_16]: And ultimately, when the committee report went out, because Ms.

1202
01:33:53,835 --> 01:33:57,336
[SPEAKER_16]: McLeod was involved in the process, she had a copy of it and made its way to the mayor's desk.

1203
01:33:58,096 --> 01:34:02,337
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe at the last meeting that we had, we adopted the committee report, but wanted to wait to act on

1204
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:06,792
[SPEAKER_16]: the proposed ordinance change until we saw all the language included in the committee report.

1205
01:34:06,852 --> 01:34:09,414
[SPEAKER_16]: The city clerk has since provided that documentation to us.

1206
01:34:09,854 --> 01:34:11,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so you're absolutely correct.

1207
01:34:11,195 --> 01:34:12,135
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks, I rest.

1208
01:34:13,256 --> 01:34:24,342
[SPEAKER_15]: So, so Mr. President, if I can remember, Diane McLeod was at the meeting and when we asked that every person have a plan, I think, and I don't want to speak for her.

1209
01:34:24,362 --> 01:34:29,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, she stated in the meeting, uh, you can't dictate that people have plans and so forth.

1210
01:34:30,525 --> 01:34:42,352
[SPEAKER_15]: And now to come out the administration, come out with something that requires these cab companies to buy a $50,000 vehicle, I think flies in the face with what the department had said at the meeting.

1211
01:34:43,192 --> 01:34:47,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Furthermore, Mr. President, and you know, I'm not going to step back from this issue.

1212
01:34:47,895 --> 01:34:52,017
[SPEAKER_15]: I've asked why the mayor's new liaison to the council

1213
01:34:52,756 --> 01:34:59,528
[SPEAKER_15]: That position was created a year ago, Mr. President, over a year ago, has not attended one city council meeting.

1214
01:35:00,249 --> 01:35:04,818
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is the reason, not because I want to see her face at the council meeting, Mr. President.

1215
01:35:05,326 --> 01:35:27,030
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is the very issue, Mr. President, when we have subcommittee meetings, and we get together with department heads, and we get together with business owners, and we sit down and have meetings and discuss issues and throw around city ordinances and discuss how it's going to be crafted, and not to have someone from the administrative office present there, Mr. President,

1216
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:40,674
[SPEAKER_15]: after multiple, multiple meetings, and then come in at the last hour and submit a veto to a paper she can't even veto, I mean, shows the fact that that position is not currently effective, Mr. President.

1217
01:35:41,114 --> 01:35:42,795
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not effective, Mr. President.

1218
01:35:43,035 --> 01:35:45,276
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a perfect example why.

1219
01:35:45,796 --> 01:35:54,619
[SPEAKER_15]: If that person was at the meeting, Mr. President, at any time they could have went back to the mayor and said, Madam Mayor, they're discussing X, Y, and Z. What are your thoughts?

1220
01:35:55,526 --> 01:36:05,928
[SPEAKER_15]: But to wait to veto something, Mr. President, and you can't even veto a committee report, I think shows that there's no interaction with this administration and this council.

1221
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:17,151
[SPEAKER_15]: And the fact that they even created a position to do so, Mr. President, flies in the face of this council voting for that position to allow the administration, which at the time was a great idea.

1222
01:36:17,451 --> 01:36:21,532
[SPEAKER_15]: The administration says, I want to do something a little different than the previous administration.

1223
01:36:21,872 --> 01:36:25,393
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to have a council liaison that will sit there and work with the council.

1224
01:36:26,994 --> 01:36:29,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you see any council liaison here, Mr. President?

1225
01:36:30,276 --> 01:36:33,399
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is the exact reason, the exact reason, Mr. President.

1226
01:36:33,759 --> 01:36:35,560
[SPEAKER_15]: I will not support that, Mr. President.

1227
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:40,804
[SPEAKER_15]: When we do call for a first reading of this, Mr. President, I will call for an override.

1228
01:36:41,084 --> 01:36:53,233
[SPEAKER_15]: If the mayor vetoes it, all you need is a two-thirds vote of this council, an override, Mr. President, because what we put in the plan addresses every aspect of providing handicapped accessibility in this committee.

1229
01:36:53,737 --> 01:36:55,758
[SPEAKER_15]: And I am comfortable with that, Mr. President.

1230
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,760
[SPEAKER_15]: And the dialogue and discussion, I think, was worthy.

1231
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:07,185
[SPEAKER_15]: We had the chief of police, we had heads of the traffic division within our meeting, and I think we vetted it out properly, Mr. President.

1232
01:37:07,546 --> 01:37:11,588
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will not support that mayor's veto, Mr. President.

1233
01:37:11,608 --> 01:37:12,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1234
01:37:13,329 --> 01:37:17,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight, will this language be in the report along with

1235
01:37:20,191 --> 01:37:21,372
[SPEAKER_04]: presently that's already there.

1236
01:37:21,392 --> 01:37:27,716
[SPEAKER_16]: So this will be, this is just adding that sentence, just adding, just adding that italicized sentence that was included in the paper that the mayor sent.

1237
01:37:27,736 --> 01:37:30,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So I say the, the paratransit plan will still remain in effect.

1238
01:37:30,618 --> 01:37:31,178
[SPEAKER_16]: That is correct.

1239
01:37:31,258 --> 01:37:31,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1240
01:37:31,718 --> 01:37:32,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Counsel Scott belly.

1241
01:37:32,999 --> 01:37:33,720
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my, I'm sorry.

1242
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:34,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1243
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:36,021
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that was the same question I had.

1244
01:37:36,041 --> 01:37:38,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I thought that was a great idea at that meeting.

1245
01:37:38,423 --> 01:37:44,327
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a Councilor Marks as a, as an outside member was there and mentioned that putting in that plan.

1246
01:37:44,387 --> 01:37:49,450
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do remember, um, um, human diversity director talking about,

1247
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,081
[SPEAKER_14]: the issues with the cabs.

1248
01:37:51,221 --> 01:38:02,551
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if something has changed since then, but I don't, I can understand your frustration, but I think that, um, something that we did try to work on and that was in our original plan.

1249
01:38:03,232 --> 01:38:11,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and adding that, I don't think that that would hurt, but I, I, I do, um, I do want to make sure that what was

1250
01:38:12,688 --> 01:38:17,410
[SPEAKER_14]: structured that evening and add it in as a working document.

1251
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:17,970
[SPEAKER_14]: That will stay.

1252
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:18,811
[SPEAKER_14]: That will stay.

1253
01:38:18,831 --> 01:38:19,591
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to make sure of that.

1254
01:38:19,611 --> 01:38:20,051
[SPEAKER_14]: That will stay.

1255
01:38:20,171 --> 01:38:20,691
[SPEAKER_14]: That is correct.

1256
01:38:22,372 --> 01:38:22,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1257
01:38:22,732 --> 01:38:23,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

1258
01:38:23,953 --> 01:38:24,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Just if I could.

1259
01:38:25,313 --> 01:38:28,055
[SPEAKER_15]: And I agree with the original language.

1260
01:38:28,095 --> 01:38:29,235
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the intent was there.

1261
01:38:29,795 --> 01:38:36,258
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I think what we're speaking of right now is first of all, we don't have any cab companies that have over five vehicles.

1262
01:38:37,358 --> 01:38:38,379
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a moot point.

1263
01:38:38,819 --> 01:38:40,940
[SPEAKER_15]: So no one's going to have to go out and buy one of these vehicles.

1264
01:38:41,939 --> 01:38:50,225
[SPEAKER_15]: The ordinance that we implemented, or that will eventually be implemented, stated that every cab company will be responsible for an alternative plan.

1265
01:38:50,845 --> 01:39:02,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, if that doesn't work, we may want to resort to saying, that plan didn't work, now we're going to have to require a cab company in our city, maybe the larger cab companies because they can afford a $50,000 expense.

1266
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:08,431
[SPEAKER_15]: to purchase a vehicle, but we haven't seen that yet.

1267
01:39:08,871 --> 01:39:23,977
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think what you're going to do now by putting a number on it, you're going to have every cab company that potentially may want to grow and provide additional service in this community say, you know what, once you meet that five maximum level, I'm not going to six because it's going to cost me $50,000.

1268
01:39:24,838 --> 01:39:28,359
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we're already providing a service,

1269
01:39:28,835 --> 01:39:40,461
[SPEAKER_15]: And able to capture that through the existing companies being able to, you know, tell people where to go to get this service, I think we're solving it all.

1270
01:39:40,481 --> 01:39:42,021
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate to put a number on it.

1271
01:39:42,121 --> 01:39:43,162
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't support the number.

1272
01:39:43,682 --> 01:39:45,823
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it will be good for business in this community.

1273
01:39:45,843 --> 01:39:48,004
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it will restrict the cab business.

1274
01:39:48,584 --> 01:39:53,907
[SPEAKER_15]: And we haven't seen yet if our original paratransit plan will work.

1275
01:39:54,647 --> 01:39:58,409
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's successful, why do we need to put a five cap on it?

1276
01:39:59,758 --> 01:40:00,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1277
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:12,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I don't have the benefit of having been on the subcommitting of zoning and ordinances for the length of time that you were in Councilor Knight.

1278
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:14,911
[SPEAKER_04]: It was almost, it took us close to two years.

1279
01:40:15,992 --> 01:40:16,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Licensing.

1280
01:40:16,373 --> 01:40:17,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the licensing.

1281
01:40:17,294 --> 01:40:18,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It took us quite some time.

1282
01:40:19,387 --> 01:40:28,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And I only came in when we were in committee of the whole last week.

1283
01:40:28,792 --> 01:40:36,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was on the tail end of this is someone who would be partial to be putting an undue

1284
01:40:39,577 --> 01:40:42,439
[SPEAKER_02]: the burden on a commercial enterprise.

1285
01:40:43,320 --> 01:41:05,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I I'd be cautious, but I also see the intent is, uh, first of all, that we wanted to be sure that, uh, uh, people have a parapet transit plan that was going to be placed on a cab companies over five, uh, cars, which is now going to be, uh, according to this language, uh, placed on all cab companies and that, uh, a cab company,

1286
01:41:05,843 --> 01:41:10,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Should one arise in this age when cab companies are going the way of Hackney carriages?

1287
01:41:11,727 --> 01:41:14,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Should a road to have five cars?

1288
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:16,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1289
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:31,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a, I find as I observe over the years, you know, some people might be grandfathered in certain things, but people more and more have an expectation of access in travel.

1290
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:35,062
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might not be a bad thing, Mr. President.

1291
01:41:35,712 --> 01:41:42,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially with the T possibly coming out with a program, the subsidize of an 80%, you can get a $50,000 vehicle for not a lot of money.

1292
01:41:43,275 --> 01:41:46,696
[SPEAKER_04]: It may, that may be a great incentive for these cap companies to go out and buy one.

1293
01:41:46,756 --> 01:41:47,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1294
01:41:47,857 --> 01:41:50,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so now Mr. President, um, may the main question be put.

1295
01:41:52,438 --> 01:41:53,759
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion by Councilor Knight.

1296
01:41:55,159 --> 01:41:56,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1297
01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:01,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure I, I understand cause are we taking a vote on the ordinance tonight?

1298
01:42:04,123 --> 01:42:04,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

1299
01:42:05,173 --> 01:42:19,080
[SPEAKER_16]: What we'd be doing tonight would be rescinding the vote to adopt the committee report, replacing, inserting the recommended language from the administration into the committee report, then we can take a vote to adopt the committee report, and if we'd like to take the vote to move the paper to first reading, we can do that too.

1300
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:26,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Alternatively, we don't have to vote to rescind, we don't have to take the vote to rescind, and we can move for first reading this evening based upon the way we did it.

1301
01:42:26,784 --> 01:42:32,227
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we can shift the burden back to the administration to make a decision as to what they want to do.

1302
01:42:32,287 --> 01:42:34,808
[SPEAKER_04]: That language was in the original proposal from the committee.

1303
01:42:37,226 --> 01:42:37,747
[SPEAKER_04]: That was right.

1304
01:42:37,787 --> 01:42:38,747
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it was changed.

1305
01:42:40,269 --> 01:42:48,715
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I understand it correctly, Councilor Marks, you want to keep it as every cab company has to have a para transit plan and take out the five language.

1306
01:42:49,015 --> 01:42:50,636
[SPEAKER_10]: And that will definitely stay in there.

1307
01:42:51,817 --> 01:42:56,601
[SPEAKER_10]: And the mayor wants us to add, if you have five or more vehicles, you have to provide.

1308
01:42:56,961 --> 01:42:57,521
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct.

1309
01:42:59,263 --> 01:43:01,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks it just, if I could,

1310
01:43:01,688 --> 01:43:04,209
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was originally in the proposal also.

1311
01:43:04,229 --> 01:43:04,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1312
01:43:04,809 --> 01:43:10,230
[SPEAKER_15]: So the subcommittee, which I wasn't part of, voted unanimously to push this language out.

1313
01:43:10,830 --> 01:43:16,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you know, maybe some members have a second thought two weeks later when the mayor says, what about this?

1314
01:43:16,752 --> 01:43:19,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, what about what information Councilor?

1315
01:43:19,372 --> 01:43:19,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1316
01:43:19,932 --> 01:43:22,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, it was the intention of the subcommittee, if I remember correctly.

1317
01:43:22,592 --> 01:43:23,712
[SPEAKER_16]: that we had a working document.

1318
01:43:23,732 --> 01:43:33,996
[SPEAKER_16]: There was some areas of the ordinance that were, um, unable to be resolved at the subcommittee level, but we had a great working document and we felt that it was appropriate to send it to the committee of the whole for further discussion and deliberation at that time.

1319
01:43:34,496 --> 01:43:34,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1320
01:43:34,816 --> 01:43:35,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor.

1321
01:43:35,657 --> 01:43:40,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, the subcommittee voted unanimously to send out that language.

1322
01:43:40,758 --> 01:43:44,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, within two weeks in a response from the mayor on a paper, she had no right responding to,

1323
01:43:45,515 --> 01:43:48,437
[SPEAKER_15]: If they want to change their vote again, Mr. President, that's up to them.

1324
01:43:49,098 --> 01:43:50,238
[SPEAKER_15]: That's up to the committee.

1325
01:43:50,298 --> 01:43:52,300
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't sit on that committee, Mr. President.

1326
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:54,601
[SPEAKER_15]: But I thought we ironed out the details.

1327
01:43:55,262 --> 01:43:59,585
[SPEAKER_15]: If I was on that committee and I wasn't comfortable with the language, I would have not gave it my support.

1328
01:44:00,065 --> 01:44:04,028
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would think that members that were on that subcommittee were comfortable with that language.

1329
01:44:04,448 --> 01:44:09,572
[SPEAKER_15]: But hey, everyone's entitled to change their vote, Mr. President, or get additional information.

1330
01:44:09,612 --> 01:44:10,773
[SPEAKER_16]: One information, Councilor Nice.

1331
01:44:11,073 --> 01:44:15,216
[SPEAKER_16]: I do believe that the language that the subcommittee reported out

1332
01:44:15,887 --> 01:44:29,265
[SPEAKER_16]: was not the same language that was reported out by the Committee of the Whole because through the legislative process, other members that became members of that committee, other members that didn't serve on the licensing committee that were on the members of the Committee of the Whole made changes to it, Mr. President.

1333
01:44:29,305 --> 01:44:30,707
[SPEAKER_16]: With that being said, I have no horse in the race.

1334
01:44:30,767 --> 01:44:31,308
[SPEAKER_16]: I was comfortable

1335
01:44:31,698 --> 01:44:36,580
[SPEAKER_16]: moving forward with the language that we had put together, Mr. President.

1336
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,141
[SPEAKER_16]: However, in my presentation.

1337
01:44:41,441 --> 01:44:53,485
[SPEAKER_02]: May I further point out that there was significant, significant, while in the committee of the whole, input and changes made by a member of the Metropolitan Police Department.

1338
01:44:53,505 --> 01:44:55,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Officer Brooks was very instrumental in helping us out with that.

1339
01:44:56,693 --> 01:45:06,861
[SPEAKER_16]: With that being said, Mr. President, when I presented the resolution, I said that we would move to amend this document only to prevent a veto down the line.

1340
01:45:08,122 --> 01:45:09,584
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's something we can all agree on, that's great.

1341
01:45:09,604 --> 01:45:10,544
[SPEAKER_16]: If not, then so be it.

1342
01:45:10,564 --> 01:45:13,787
[SPEAKER_16]: The process is the process, Mr. President.

1343
01:45:13,867 --> 01:45:23,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Either way, the reason that I put forward the paper was to working as a homogeneous body, moving forward with the administration, taking their

1344
01:45:24,065 --> 01:45:29,950
[SPEAKER_16]: recommendation into consideration and determining right now through deliberation whether or not it's a good idea.

1345
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:38,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, at no time should we as a council ever deliberate with the intent that we have to worry about a veto from the administration.

1346
01:45:38,557 --> 01:45:42,140
[SPEAKER_15]: At no time should that ever even come up as a topic of discussion, first of all.

1347
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:43,541
[SPEAKER_15]: And secondly, if the

1348
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:52,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Administration was so intent on providing language, they should have had a representative from her office there, Mr. President, to take part of the discussion.

1349
01:45:53,132 --> 01:45:55,852
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't keep tabs on who's coming in and out.

1350
01:45:56,092 --> 01:45:58,212
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't preclude anyone from coming in.

1351
01:45:58,493 --> 01:45:59,853
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an open public meeting.

1352
01:46:00,473 --> 01:46:10,195
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I just am a little troubled that within two weeks that someone that votes on something all of a sudden has a major change of heart, Mr. President.

1353
01:46:10,875 --> 01:46:12,375
[SPEAKER_15]: And to say this strengthens

1354
01:46:13,526 --> 01:46:14,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't fool yourself.

1355
01:46:15,026 --> 01:46:18,667
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have a cab company that has more than five vehicles.

1356
01:46:19,328 --> 01:46:24,009
[SPEAKER_15]: So right now, how is that strength in access to disability?

1357
01:46:24,569 --> 01:46:25,389
[SPEAKER_15]: How is that strength?

1358
01:46:25,589 --> 01:46:27,770
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have a company that has to provide that.

1359
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:30,570
[SPEAKER_15]: So this language means zero.

1360
01:46:31,271 --> 01:46:32,331
[SPEAKER_15]: The big goose egg.

1361
01:46:32,811 --> 01:46:36,312
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's not let people believe that if this language is not in here,

1362
01:46:36,632 --> 01:46:42,274
[SPEAKER_15]: that people won't have the ability to heal a handicapped vehicle in the community.

1363
01:46:42,654 --> 01:46:50,197
[SPEAKER_15]: What we did during that subcommittee was create a power transit plan for every

1364
01:46:51,657 --> 01:46:57,199
[SPEAKER_15]: cab company in this city, whether it has one vehicle, two vehicle, or three vehicle.

1365
01:46:57,579 --> 01:47:01,520
[SPEAKER_15]: That strengthened the ordinance, not this fake number.

1366
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:03,501
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why we removed it, Mr. President.

1367
01:47:03,841 --> 01:47:06,922
[SPEAKER_15]: And now if members have a change of mind, good luck to them.

1368
01:47:07,482 --> 01:47:09,963
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's how they want to do business, good luck to them.

1369
01:47:10,543 --> 01:47:15,925
[SPEAKER_16]: I do believe that I was the member that authored the paratransit plan language at the subcommittee meeting.

1370
01:47:16,025 --> 01:47:16,565
[SPEAKER_16]: I put it forward.

1371
01:47:16,605 --> 01:47:17,585
[SPEAKER_16]: It's something I support.

1372
01:47:17,765 --> 01:47:19,646
[SPEAKER_16]: As I said, this is an effort to work

1373
01:47:19,976 --> 01:47:22,878
[SPEAKER_16]: with the administration and take their recommendation under consideration.

1374
01:47:23,379 --> 01:47:24,480
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no horse in the race.

1375
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,381
[SPEAKER_16]: I move for a vote, Mr. President.

1376
01:47:26,761 --> 01:47:27,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Move for a vote.

1377
01:47:27,322 --> 01:47:28,563
[SPEAKER_16]: If we want to rescind the vote, we can.

1378
01:47:28,603 --> 01:47:29,684
[SPEAKER_16]: If we don't, we don't have to.

1379
01:47:29,764 --> 01:47:35,908
[SPEAKER_16]: We can move the legislation forward as adopted by the subcommittee and as adopted by the committee of the whole.

1380
01:47:35,928 --> 01:47:37,149
[SPEAKER_15]: That wasn't your original comment.

1381
01:47:37,169 --> 01:47:38,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Your original comment was to rescind.

1382
01:47:39,831 --> 01:47:40,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you're changing your mind again.

1383
01:47:40,992 --> 01:47:43,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1384
01:47:43,074 --> 01:47:44,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1385
01:47:44,155 --> 01:47:45,776
[SPEAKER_16]: Procedurally, we need to rescind the vote.

1386
01:47:46,597 --> 01:47:49,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Or, to amend it, to send it to the administration.

1387
01:47:49,858 --> 01:47:50,899
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have to rescind our vote.

1388
01:47:50,919 --> 01:47:53,801
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have to rescind the vote, then we can move for approval on the paper, one or the other.

1389
01:47:53,841 --> 01:47:55,022
[SPEAKER_16]: You asked to rescind the vote.

1390
01:47:55,162 --> 01:47:58,685
[SPEAKER_16]: And to prompt the discussion.

1391
01:47:58,825 --> 01:48:00,326
[SPEAKER_16]: I really, like I said, I have no horse in the race.

1392
01:48:00,346 --> 01:48:00,846
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't mind debating.

1393
01:48:00,967 --> 01:48:01,807
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't mind debating.

1394
01:48:01,827 --> 01:48:03,529
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got to stick to what you're debating about.

1395
01:48:04,169 --> 01:48:06,411
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's very difficult to debate.

1396
01:48:06,491 --> 01:48:12,796
[SPEAKER_16]: As I stated, when the paper came forward, this was an effort to take their recommendations under consideration and move forward in concert, Mr. President.

1397
01:48:13,056 --> 01:48:15,538
[SPEAKER_16]: If the member doesn't feel it's a good language, all he has to do is vote no.

1398
01:48:16,278 --> 01:48:17,079
[SPEAKER_16]: You felt it wasn't.

1399
01:48:17,099 --> 01:48:17,779
[SPEAKER_15]: You felt that language.

1400
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,321
[SPEAKER_15]: You were comfortable with the language two weeks ago.

1401
01:48:19,983 --> 01:48:21,363
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm still comfortable with that language.

1402
01:48:21,403 --> 01:48:24,704
[SPEAKER_16]: And like I said, it was an effort to work in concert with the administration.

1403
01:48:25,244 --> 01:48:26,325
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all, no more, no less.

1404
01:48:26,705 --> 01:48:29,385
[SPEAKER_16]: So now the paper can go through first reading, get vetoed, come back to us.

1405
01:48:29,425 --> 01:48:31,106
[SPEAKER_16]: We can override the veto and go through the process.

1406
01:48:31,146 --> 01:48:31,646
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

1407
01:48:33,266 --> 01:48:34,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, then what's the motion?

1408
01:48:35,787 --> 01:48:37,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, motion to withdraw.

1409
01:48:38,128 --> 01:48:39,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to withdraw.

1410
01:48:39,328 --> 01:48:40,448
[SPEAKER_16]: The question to rescind.

1411
01:48:40,728 --> 01:48:41,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to withdraw.

1412
01:48:41,508 --> 01:48:42,409
[SPEAKER_04]: The question to rescind.

1413
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:45,710
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, motion to move paper 17-022 to its first reading.

1414
01:48:49,173 --> 01:48:50,854
[SPEAKER_15]: If the mayor wants a veto, let her veto.

1415
01:48:50,874 --> 01:48:51,434
[SPEAKER_16]: Let her veto then.

1416
01:48:51,714 --> 01:48:52,054
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1417
01:48:52,134 --> 01:48:52,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we'll decide then.

1418
01:48:53,234 --> 01:48:53,554
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1419
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:56,695
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to move to the first reading.

1420
01:48:56,715 --> 01:49:00,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor DelaRosa, did you want to say something?

1421
01:49:01,456 --> 01:49:04,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have the paper before us that's been repaired?

1422
01:49:08,538 --> 01:49:09,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be repaired.

1423
01:49:10,972 --> 01:49:12,193
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1424
01:49:12,373 --> 01:49:17,997
[SPEAKER_02]: When it came out of committee, we added some language to it, I believe, in the last committee of the whole.

1425
01:49:18,117 --> 01:49:20,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And that language was vetoed by the mayor?

1426
01:49:22,401 --> 01:49:23,021
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not.

1427
01:49:23,501 --> 01:49:25,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not vetoed by anyone.

1428
01:49:29,026 --> 01:49:31,287
[SPEAKER_16]: It came to the Medford City Council's floor.

1429
01:49:31,327 --> 01:49:33,529
[SPEAKER_16]: The Medford City Council adopted the committee report.

1430
01:49:33,865 --> 01:49:38,589
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at the minutes from the January 10th meeting, the language is included in the minutes from the January 10th meeting.

1431
01:49:39,169 --> 01:49:39,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1432
01:49:39,550 --> 01:49:42,652
[SPEAKER_16]: So we all said, okay, let's adopt the committee report.

1433
01:49:42,973 --> 01:49:52,601
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to hold off on first reading until we get a copy of the draft language with the changes that were made by the council and that were recommended also by officer Brooks from the traffic commission.

1434
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:57,605
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's, it's attached in the official minutes of the council right here that I have beside me.

1435
01:49:58,165 --> 01:49:59,366
[SPEAKER_02]: My apologies.

1436
01:49:59,847 --> 01:50:00,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1437
01:50:02,394 --> 01:50:05,275
[SPEAKER_16]: So procedurally this paper has never made a first reading.

1438
01:50:05,476 --> 01:50:05,976
[SPEAKER_16]: That's correct.

1439
01:50:06,216 --> 01:50:08,537
[SPEAKER_16]: The committee report was reported out favorably by the council.

1440
01:50:08,577 --> 01:50:10,358
[SPEAKER_16]: The administration got a copy of the committee report.

1441
01:50:10,378 --> 01:50:13,279
[SPEAKER_16]: The administration gave us recommendations as to what they'd like to see happen.

1442
01:50:13,959 --> 01:50:16,881
[SPEAKER_16]: I put a paper forward to rescind the vote so that we could have the discussion on this.

1443
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:18,842
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, if we don't want to move forward on it, that's fine.

1444
01:50:20,282 --> 01:50:28,066
[SPEAKER_16]: I made a motion to withdraw that, withdraw that paper now and to move forward for a first reading on the paper as committed out of the, as reported out of the committee of the whole initially.

1445
01:50:28,483 --> 01:50:31,606
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll shift the burden back to the administration to take what steps they need to take.

1446
01:50:31,806 --> 01:50:33,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Second by Councilor Knight.

1447
01:50:33,427 --> 01:50:33,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call.

1448
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:36,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor.

1449
01:50:36,951 --> 01:50:38,752
[SPEAKER_04]: First by Councilor.

1450
01:50:40,934 --> 01:50:42,436
[SPEAKER_04]: That's both papers in the committee, correct?

1451
01:50:43,797 --> 01:50:44,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me?

1452
01:50:44,537 --> 01:50:45,338
[SPEAKER_04]: The rate.

1453
01:50:45,378 --> 01:50:47,600
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a rate sheet in there.

1454
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:47,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1455
01:50:48,801 --> 01:50:49,582

[SPEAKER_04]: 7-0, motion passes.

1476

[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn that we revert back to regular business.

1477
01:51:24,903 --> 01:51:27,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1478
01:51:27,244 --> 01:51:27,264
[SPEAKER_04]: 0-746.

01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:40,987
[SPEAKER_04]: petition by Robert M Penta zero summit road method mass to address the city council regarding the proposed G I C health care changes.

1480
01:51:41,507 --> 01:51:42,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record please.

1481
01:51:43,889 --> 01:51:44,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of order.

1482
01:51:44,670 --> 01:51:45,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1483
01:51:45,810 --> 01:51:50,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, in my hands here, I have a opinion from the city solicitor dated February 23rd, 2015.

1484
01:51:50,734 --> 01:51:56,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, at that time I had requested that the city solicitor provide me with an opinion

1485
01:51:57,202 --> 01:52:03,707
[SPEAKER_16]: as to whether or not it would pose to be a conflict of interest if I participated in discussions relative to the Group Insurance Commission, Mr. President.

1486
01:52:04,107 --> 01:52:15,657
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas I'm a member that receives health benefits through the Group Insurance Commission, Solicitor Rumley has given an opinion that I should recuse myself from all discussions relative to the Group Insurance Commission and the rate setting thereof, Mr. President.

1487
01:52:16,297 --> 01:52:22,722
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a copy of this letter in my hand, and I'd like to give it to the city messenger to give to you to place on file, Mr. President.

1488
01:52:22,762 --> 01:52:26,245
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel as though the city solicitor has given an opinion, which I'd be happy to read into the record.

1489
01:52:28,139 --> 01:52:33,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other members that share Councilor Knight's opinion and would want to be recused?

1490
01:52:33,965 --> 01:52:35,306
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not my opinion, Mr. President.

1491
01:52:35,386 --> 01:52:37,028
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the opinion of the city solicitor.

1492
01:52:37,548 --> 01:52:43,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And it reads... Are there any other members who ask to be recused from this discussion because of the reading there?

1493
01:52:46,517 --> 01:52:46,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1494
01:52:46,657 --> 01:52:46,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1495
01:52:46,857 --> 01:52:46,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1496
01:52:46,957 --> 01:52:47,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1497
01:52:47,137 --> 01:52:50,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Councilor Knight, Councilor Longo Kearn, Councilor Scarpelli.

1498
01:52:52,386 --> 01:52:53,446
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a conflict of interest.

1499
01:52:53,587 --> 01:52:54,887
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd be happy to read it into the record.

1500
01:52:55,487 --> 01:52:57,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1501
01:52:59,249 --> 01:53:14,295
[SPEAKER_16]: It says, um, actually what the question says is does general law chapter 268 a permit you to participate in discussions at the Medford city council that pertain to the GIC insurance rates in light of your being subscribers to the health insurance covered provided through the GIC.

1502
01:53:14,835 --> 01:53:21,558
[SPEAKER_16]: In my opinion, you should not engage in discussions at the many Medford city council that pertain to GIC insurance rates because under the provisions of

1503
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:35,747
[SPEAKER_16]: general laws chapter 268 a you are considered a municipal employee and municipal employees may not participate in any particular matter in which he or she has a financial interest as elected of the members as elected members of the Medford city council.

1504
01:53:35,767 --> 01:53:48,052
[SPEAKER_16]: You are considered a municipal employee for the purposes of the Massachusetts conflict of interest law section 19 a thereof provides except as permitted by paragraph B a municipal employee who participates as such an employee in a particular matter,

1505
01:53:48,863 --> 01:54:14,182
[SPEAKER_16]: in which to his knowledge he, his immediate family or partner, a business organization in which he is serving as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee, or any person or organization with whom he is negotiating or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment has a financial interest and shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 or by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years or in a jail or house of corrections for not more than two and a half years or both.

1506
01:54:14,932 --> 01:54:19,094
[SPEAKER_16]: A financial interest may create a conflict whether the financial interest is large or small, positive or negative.

1507
01:54:19,154 --> 01:54:24,657
[SPEAKER_16]: It does not matter if your participation would result in money coming to you or additional money being expended by you.

1508
01:54:26,437 --> 01:54:28,899
[SPEAKER_16]: If you have a financial interest in a matter, you may not participate.

1509
01:54:29,439 --> 01:54:33,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Participation can be as simple as making a recommendation or rendering advice or otherwise.

1510
01:54:34,421 --> 01:54:38,383
[SPEAKER_16]: As rate-paying subscribers and health insurance policies offered by the GIC, you have an

1511
01:54:38,783 --> 01:54:44,085
[SPEAKER_16]: undeniable financial interest, and therefore you should not participate in the discussion of proposed rate increases.

1512
01:54:44,685 --> 01:54:49,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Furthermore, please note that the rule of necessity does not provide an avenue to allow you to discuss this matter.

1513
01:54:50,228 --> 01:55:03,873
[SPEAKER_16]: The courts have established the rule of necessity to allow public officials to participate in official decisions from which they are otherwise disqualified by their bias, prejudice, or interest when no other official or agency is available to make the decision.

1514
01:55:04,633 --> 01:55:06,734
[SPEAKER_16]: See the Mayor of Everett versus the Superior Court, 324 Mass 144,

1515
01:55:09,025 --> 01:55:23,816
[SPEAKER_16]: 1 5 1 1949 in Moran versus the school committee of Littleton 3 17 mass 5 9 1 pages 5 93 to 5 94 1945 in this case before the council, the G I C makes the decision regarding insurance rates.

1516
01:55:24,477 --> 01:55:37,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Finally, the filing of a form to make a full disclosure of financial financial interest is set forth in G L 2 6 8 a section 19 B is only available to appointed or non elected municipal employees as defined in GL chapter two 60 years.

1517
01:55:38,187 --> 01:55:38,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1518
01:55:38,929 --> 01:55:41,090
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to be thorough.

1519
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:51,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it be noted for the record that Councilor Knight, Councilor Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Scarpelli, if you could recuse yourself from behind the rail, it would be appreciated.

1520
01:55:52,113 --> 01:55:54,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone else belong to the GIC insurance?

1521
01:55:58,315 --> 01:56:00,076
[SPEAKER_04]: They should recuse themselves from behind the rail.

1522
01:56:00,496 --> 01:56:02,216
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't have to participate in the conversation.

1523
01:56:02,457 --> 01:56:03,077
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.

1524
01:56:03,097 --> 01:56:07,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone else have the GIC insurance that has a problem?

1525
01:56:08,722 --> 01:56:09,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1526
01:56:09,922 --> 01:56:12,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let the record show that I do not participate in the GIC.

1527
01:56:12,884 --> 01:56:13,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

1528
01:56:13,625 --> 01:56:19,269
[SPEAKER_02]: May I further inquire though, Mr. President, if we have sufficient amount of Councilors for us to be in business.

1529
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:24,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello does not employ himself with the GIC.

1530
01:56:24,912 --> 01:56:25,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

1531
01:56:26,493 --> 01:56:27,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco does not.

1532
01:56:27,954 --> 01:56:28,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not have GIC insurance.

1533
01:56:28,895 --> 01:56:30,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have GIC insurance either.

1534
01:56:30,736 --> 01:56:32,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marksley, you have GIC insurance.

1535
01:56:32,638 --> 01:56:33,798
[SPEAKER_15]: This sounds like an inquisition.

1536
01:56:34,519 --> 01:56:35,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Just asking if you want to be

1537
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:39,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, we've had members of this council vote on their own pay raise.

1538
01:56:40,572 --> 01:56:43,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Talk about, talk about a conflict of interest.

1539
01:56:43,333 --> 01:56:44,013
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just going by.

1540
01:56:44,133 --> 01:56:45,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, that does not apply to me.

1541
01:56:45,974 --> 01:56:48,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I don't think it applies to anyone.

1542
01:56:48,055 --> 01:56:49,335
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fine to be quite honest with you.

1543
01:56:49,956 --> 01:56:50,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record, please.

1544
01:56:50,876 --> 01:56:59,000
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Robert Penta zero summit road, Medford mass, former member of this August body who did engage in a conversation as it relates to this.

1545
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:06,023
[SPEAKER_12]: At that point in time, I was a member of the board of directors of the mass municipal association and I brought the message back to this method city council.

1546
01:57:06,597 --> 01:57:10,581
[SPEAKER_12]: as it related to the new changing of GIC insurance to cities and towns.

1547
01:57:11,141 --> 01:57:11,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Quick history.

1548
01:57:11,702 --> 01:57:26,514
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason why I'm here tonight, I was edified by a union representative as it states, as this gentleman stated that on February 1st, there will be a public hearing in Boston as it relates to these new GIC changes.

1549
01:57:26,975 --> 01:57:33,320
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was, he was encouraging his membership, which includes city of Medford employees to go there and to participate.

1550
01:57:34,081 --> 01:57:34,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Um,

1551
01:57:34,597 --> 01:57:41,583
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm speaking in behalf of all City of Medford employees and retirees, as well as myself, Mr. President.

1552
01:57:42,223 --> 01:57:55,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Quick history, back in January 14th of 2015, before this Medford City Council, it was shown and it was presented to you that GIC, for which the City of Medford became a member on January 1st, 2012,

1553
01:57:57,865 --> 01:58:04,090
[SPEAKER_12]: was at a deficit of approximately $160 to $190 million in deficit.

1554
01:58:04,630 --> 01:58:12,777
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was a result of three prior years of not being funded by the state legislature to meet the needs that GIC needed to have.

1555
01:58:13,237 --> 01:58:20,743
[SPEAKER_12]: That presented, at that point in time, a $120 million deficit that was below the, at present then, funding level.

1556
01:58:21,383 --> 01:58:27,428
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was due to the statewide underfunding, and it was also due to the misprojected increased claims costs

1557
01:58:27,881 --> 01:58:30,562
[SPEAKER_12]: regarding health care here in Massachusetts.

1558
01:58:31,582 --> 01:58:34,063
[SPEAKER_12]: So what happened at that point in time some two years ago?

1559
01:58:34,623 --> 01:58:40,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Rates increased, deductibles increased, and office visits increased.

1560
01:58:41,486 --> 01:58:48,508
[SPEAKER_12]: When the city of Medford went from bargaining from a PPO to a POS, for cities and towns required union support.

1561
01:58:49,408 --> 01:58:55,130
[SPEAKER_12]: And the union support came from the city of Medford as well when they signed that contract in August of 2011 by 14 signatories

1562
01:58:58,212 --> 01:59:01,015
[SPEAKER_12]: of people, representatives here in the city of Medford.

1563
01:59:01,936 --> 01:59:07,561
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we have a GIC proposal that is pending before the legislature and it'll be pending before GIC.

1564
01:59:07,902 --> 01:59:10,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Strike that, it's before GIC, not the legislature.

1565
01:59:10,945 --> 01:59:15,989
[SPEAKER_12]: And the proposal is going to make a request that a unilateral

1566
01:59:16,869 --> 01:59:21,892
[SPEAKER_12]: implementation for an additional cost shift and plan design be proposed.

1567
01:59:22,672 --> 01:59:25,874
[SPEAKER_12]: We here in the city of Medford are under the GIC plan.

1568
01:59:25,914 --> 01:59:39,823
[SPEAKER_12]: And under the GIC plan, we agreed by subscription and definition and signatory signing off in August of 2011 that we would accept whatever GIC was going to present, whether they be for the cost, whether they be for the, for whatever the costs were,

1569
01:59:40,907 --> 01:59:42,907
[SPEAKER_12]: that people chose in their health plan.

1570
01:59:43,648 --> 02:00:03,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, if we go to this unilateral change, the question, and the question still hasn't been answered, and GIC has yet to answer it, does the unilateral change mean that the manager or the mayor of a community can unilaterally make that change, or do they need the confirmation support by the local legislative body?

1571
02:00:04,012 --> 02:00:05,872
[SPEAKER_12]: In this case, it would be the city council.

1572
02:00:06,678 --> 02:00:10,860
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we had to do years ago when Mayor McGlynn accepted GIC.

1573
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:14,961
[SPEAKER_12]: It was presented before the Medford City Council for a vote of support.

1574
02:00:15,861 --> 02:00:21,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, the ludicrous part about this whole thing is you're asked to vote on something, but you can't discuss it.

1575
02:00:21,503 --> 02:00:22,584
[SPEAKER_12]: That makes no sense at all.

1576
02:00:23,464 --> 02:00:24,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely no sense at all.

1577
02:00:25,185 --> 02:00:31,847
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I don't know where you're going to be going, but I think those of you that aren't on GIC and have an opportunity to speak

1578
02:00:32,584 --> 02:00:38,508
[SPEAKER_12]: and make your representation known to the employees and the retirees of the city, this is going to be huge.

1579
02:00:39,029 --> 02:00:46,114
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason why it's going to be huge, because the state's use of this increase is projected at approximately 3.6%.

1580
02:00:47,935 --> 02:00:55,720
[SPEAKER_12]: But it also provides that these costs are running at large because of MassHealth.

1581
02:00:56,201 --> 02:01:00,904
[SPEAKER_12]: MassHealth is a $14 billion item in the state's budget.

1582
02:01:00,984 --> 02:01:02,225
[SPEAKER_12]: It represents approximately

1583
02:01:02,902 --> 02:01:04,063
[SPEAKER_12]: 40% of the state's budget.

1584
02:01:04,843 --> 02:01:19,670
[SPEAKER_12]: And because it represents 40% of the state budget, whatever those cost overruns have been over the past two or three years, they are now being shifted over, as in the administration and finance report the other day came out and said that everyone's going to have to bear the cost.

1585
02:01:20,648 --> 02:01:23,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't think everybody should have to bear the cost.

1586
02:01:23,069 --> 02:01:28,131
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think an active working employee and more importantly a retiree should have to pay for that cost.

1587
02:01:28,371 --> 02:01:30,773
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't cause that cost increase to take place.

1588
02:01:31,433 --> 02:01:37,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the legislature on Beacon Hill, they need to do their work and they need to get into reading what's going on.

1589
02:01:37,496 --> 02:01:42,838
[SPEAKER_12]: They need to understand that the cost of health care and drugs and prescriptions

1590
02:01:44,205 --> 02:01:45,106
[SPEAKER_12]: is huge here.

1591
02:01:45,566 --> 02:01:52,849
[SPEAKER_12]: We are the most expensive country in the world, and we are the most expensive state in the country as a result of health care costs.

1592
02:01:53,590 --> 02:02:03,735
[SPEAKER_12]: In January of 2017, this month, there was a Freedman health care report that came out that so describes the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1593
02:02:04,128 --> 02:02:05,288
[SPEAKER_12]: in the position that it's in.

1594
02:02:05,968 --> 02:02:08,249
[SPEAKER_12]: We pay an awful lot for health care in Massachusetts.

1595
02:02:08,789 --> 02:02:19,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we do have probably the best hospitals in the world, but that should have nothing to do with how we in cities and towns went out of our way six years ago to negotiate our health care costs.

1596
02:02:20,772 --> 02:02:26,333
[SPEAKER_12]: As of January of this year, according to the contract and the memorandum of understanding between the city of Medford

1597
02:02:26,740 --> 02:02:39,570
[SPEAKER_12]: its retirees and its active employees, as of January this year, we have until January to October 1st to make a definite decision whether we stay in the GIC plan or not.

1598
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:55,562
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we don't stay in that plan for GIC, we have between October 1st and June 30th of 2018 to make that final decision where we go, whether we go back to competitive bidding, other insurance companies come in and what have you.

1599
02:02:56,282 --> 02:03:01,143
[SPEAKER_12]: The contract that Mayor McGlynn signed brings us to 2018, that's six and a half years.

1600
02:03:01,644 --> 02:03:17,208
[SPEAKER_12]: The city of Medford was told we would be saving over that six and a half year period of time approximately 25 plus million dollars in health care costs and the rates that were set by GIC would be the rates that would be set for those people who are members of GIC.

1601
02:03:18,746 --> 02:03:33,795
[SPEAKER_12]: This change to go to a unilateral decision, if GIC were to accept it, and the city of Medford were to engage in a unilateral decision, could have an absolute financial devastating effect on retirees and active employees.

1602
02:03:34,595 --> 02:03:35,916
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not what it was meant to be.

1603
02:03:36,656 --> 02:03:41,299
[SPEAKER_12]: This proposal, unilaterally, is going to shift the cost

1604
02:03:42,457 --> 02:04:00,632
[SPEAKER_12]: to GIC employees, because if GIC employees go to a unilateral determination, those people who don't have GIC, as compared to those that do, will bear the additional cost as it relates to making the bill be paid here in the city of Medford.

1605
02:04:01,573 --> 02:04:10,160
[SPEAKER_12]: The other part we should take into consideration is the question, how do we get this question answered?

1606
02:04:11,413 --> 02:04:20,470
[SPEAKER_12]: You folks, those of you that are out there right now, that are not sitting here, but are members of GIC, I think you need to ask the question.

1607
02:04:20,846 --> 02:04:29,070
[SPEAKER_12]: because it's not expressing a financial interest, it's expressing a need to know whether in fact the city of Medford is going to continue on with GIC.

1608
02:04:29,590 --> 02:04:38,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And if the city of Medford is not going to continue on with GIC, you as a legislative body, I'm assuming we'll have to make that decision by choice of change.

1609
02:04:39,494 --> 02:04:48,358
[SPEAKER_12]: And the mayor should be making this type of representation before you, this type of consideration before you as to where and what effect it's going to have here within your budget.

1610
02:04:50,998 --> 02:04:51,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

1611
02:04:55,001 --> 02:04:55,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1612
02:04:56,022 --> 02:05:13,497
[SPEAKER_12]: This brings us to the matter of how do we pursue section 13, 14, and 15 and the memorandum of agreement between the city of Medford and its retirees and

1613
02:05:14,736 --> 02:05:17,877
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's retirees and everyday workers, regular workers.

1614
02:05:18,697 --> 02:05:31,600
[SPEAKER_12]: These action alerts coming from the Commonwealth of Mass, coming from the Office of Administration and Finance, participating municipalities such as we, and the memorandum of understanding that we have over here, it's very important, it's very important to know.

1615
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:39,682
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's very important to understand that by June 30th of 2018, you folks are gonna have to know where you're gonna go.

1616
02:05:40,022 --> 02:05:41,242
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's the retirees,

1617
02:05:42,332 --> 02:05:44,373
[SPEAKER_12]: who are the important component of all of this.

1618
02:05:44,393 --> 02:05:56,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they should not have the shifted burden of having the increase in cost for medical services through the insurance company for which they are represented by people who negotiate here with the city of Medford.

1619
02:05:57,959 --> 02:06:00,540
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we talk about a lot of things around here.

1620
02:06:01,384 --> 02:06:14,108
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is equally as important as maybe to zoning, because we're talking about our municipal employees, we're talking about our school department employees, we're talking about union and non-union members, because they all come under this insurance situation.

1621
02:06:14,748 --> 02:06:27,051
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you think about the increase in cost, your cost in your food, your cost in your taxes that just went up, your water and sewer rates that have just gone up, you have a Community Preservation Act tax that went up, okay?

1622
02:06:27,631 --> 02:06:29,412
[SPEAKER_12]: All types of insurances that have gone up.

1623
02:06:30,192 --> 02:06:40,042
[SPEAKER_12]: And most recently, since January 11, you have people concerned over whether their employment as it relates to vacation time was going to be an issue.

1624
02:06:40,382 --> 02:06:43,225
[SPEAKER_12]: That's gone back and forth as to what it's all about.

1625
02:06:43,926 --> 02:06:46,408
[SPEAKER_12]: It's making it harder and harder for our municipal employees.

1626
02:06:47,069 --> 02:06:48,310
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't make an awful lot of money.

1627
02:06:48,591 --> 02:06:49,531
[SPEAKER_12]: They work for their job.

1628
02:06:49,552 --> 02:06:51,153
[SPEAKER_12]: They're good employees.

1629
02:06:51,173 --> 02:06:52,474
[SPEAKER_12]: 99% of them are good employees.

1630
02:06:53,207 --> 02:06:58,949
[SPEAKER_12]: But they have a right to know where they're going and to shop around, if need be the case, to pick out a health care provider.

1631
02:06:59,349 --> 02:07:05,191
[SPEAKER_12]: But the city owes it to every single municipal employee and retiree to let them know whether they're going to be on board or not.

1632
02:07:05,751 --> 02:07:16,815
[SPEAKER_12]: So Mr. President, through you, I would respectfully ask that, since you're not a member of JIC, that I would respectfully ask that you ask of the president administration, however the answer needs to come in,

1633
02:07:17,696 --> 02:07:33,019
[SPEAKER_12]: whether the unilateral proposal, if approved by GIC, empowers the mayor of this community to make independent decisions, that for which GIC, for which we are presently under, would not, I mean, that's the whole issue.

1634
02:07:33,439 --> 02:07:35,780
[SPEAKER_12]: February 1st, there's a huge hearing.

1635
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:37,840
[SPEAKER_12]: They're asking many, many people to go.

1636
02:07:38,501 --> 02:07:41,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Last time when this issue became a fact, 80,000 emails, 80,000 emails were sent to GIC.

1637
02:07:45,374 --> 02:07:47,975
[SPEAKER_12]: And unfortunately, they didn't listen to them and they didn't adhere to them.

1638
02:07:48,635 --> 02:07:51,096
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would hope in this situation... Excuse me, Council Member.

1639
02:07:51,576 --> 02:07:53,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Gentlemen, could we respect the person on the rail, please?

1640
02:07:53,897 --> 02:07:54,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1641
02:07:54,998 --> 02:07:55,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1642
02:07:55,838 --> 02:08:01,240
[SPEAKER_12]: At this particular time, Mr. President, this is an important issue, but this is an issue to talk about now, well in advance.

1643
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:05,782
[SPEAKER_12]: As the memorandum of understanding indicates, it indicates here as of January,

1644
02:08:06,583 --> 02:08:13,545
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe January of this year, 2017, between January and October 17th, the city has to make its decision.

1645
02:08:13,945 --> 02:08:20,787
[SPEAKER_12]: They should be talking right now with the bargaining units of all 14 signatories that signed up on this memorandum of understanding.

1646
02:08:21,387 --> 02:08:27,069
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would hope, Mr. President, that when February 1st comes at 1230 p.m.

1647
02:08:27,089 --> 02:08:33,311
[SPEAKER_12]: at 19 Standover Street in Boston, we can get as many people as we can there to tell them we do not want to go to this unilateral

1648
02:08:33,715 --> 02:08:44,659
[SPEAKER_12]: this unilateral allowance because that's going to basically cost shift, cost shift, whatever the deficit is running in mass health as part of it over to the GIC people.

1649
02:08:45,019 --> 02:08:45,739
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't cause it.

1650
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:51,622
[SPEAKER_12]: They're willing to pay their fair share, but it's going up and it's, and it's just not right.

1651
02:08:51,642 --> 02:08:52,542
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just not fair.

1652
02:08:53,322 --> 02:08:59,745
[SPEAKER_12]: And just as a side note, and I don't mean to be humorous, but Christmas is over, correct?

1653
02:09:00,665 --> 02:09:00,825
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.

1654
02:09:01,173 --> 02:09:04,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there any reason why the Christmas lights are still up on the building outside?

1655
02:09:04,074 --> 02:09:07,054
[SPEAKER_12]: I do not have that answer.

1656
02:09:07,114 --> 02:09:08,975
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not the main to the question.

1657
02:09:09,235 --> 02:09:13,455
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that, but we got to move on unless they're up early for next year.

1658
02:09:13,495 --> 02:09:13,896
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1659
02:09:13,956 --> 02:09:14,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

1660
02:09:14,356 --> 02:09:16,056
[SPEAKER_12]: But the question is simply this.

1661
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:20,397
[SPEAKER_12]: I would hope you folks and through the chair, Mr. President, you get that answer.

1662
02:09:20,417 --> 02:09:21,277
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an important answer.

1663
02:09:21,697 --> 02:09:26,138
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you can get it before February 1st, it would be great because somebody has to have that answer as it relates to

1664
02:09:27,038 --> 02:09:28,098
[SPEAKER_12]: your, well, it's not yours.

1665
02:09:28,118 --> 02:09:31,600
[SPEAKER_12]: You're on your private one, you know, but those who are retirees, those who are employees.

1666
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:36,581
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to thank that union representative who put that out there on Facebook, who made the request.

1667
02:09:36,621 --> 02:09:40,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause that's what got me on this particular kick to go forward and make this presentation.

1668
02:09:40,903 --> 02:09:41,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1669
02:09:41,603 --> 02:09:42,063
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

1670
02:09:42,103 --> 02:09:43,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by councilor Falco.

1671
02:09:43,244 --> 02:09:44,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me.

1672
02:09:45,825 --> 02:09:46,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1673
02:09:46,265 --> 02:09:47,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1674
02:09:48,206 --> 02:09:51,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Jay Griffin, 8 Aberglund lane, Methuen.

1675
02:09:52,527 --> 02:09:54,648
[SPEAKER_13]: The last time I addressed the city council,

1676
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:58,941
[SPEAKER_13]: A GIC had $150 million deficit.

1677
02:09:59,361 --> 02:10:09,624
[SPEAKER_13]: The Group Insurance Commission laid the burden of the debt on the backs of public employees, Medford's teachers, police, fire, and municipal workers.

1678
02:10:10,944 --> 02:10:20,627
[SPEAKER_13]: As you all know, retirees live on a fixed pension and cannot absorb drastic increases to the healthcare costs every single year, which has happened.

1679
02:10:21,698 --> 02:10:30,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Governor Baker, GIC Director, is proposing significant cost shifting in our GIC plan starting July 1, 2017.

1680
02:10:31,525 --> 02:10:43,234
[SPEAKER_13]: The changes being proposed for adoption by GIC would allow cities and towns to unilaterally implement additional cost shifts in its plan design.

1681
02:10:44,475 --> 02:10:48,698
[SPEAKER_13]: The Governor's Office of Administration and Finance issued the following statement.

1682
02:10:49,733 --> 02:10:56,116
[SPEAKER_13]: MassHealth now costs more than $15 billion a year, nearly 40 percent of the state budget.

1683
02:10:56,956 --> 02:11:02,058
[SPEAKER_13]: As a result, all state agencies, including GIC, must trim their sales.

1684
02:11:03,019 --> 02:11:05,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know about you, but I'm not a MassHealth.

1685
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:12,383
[SPEAKER_13]: I paid for health insurance every year I was working as a teacher in Medford for 35 years, and I continue to pay thousands of dollars every single year.

1686
02:11:13,283 --> 02:11:17,565
[SPEAKER_13]: So for us to shoulder the burden for MassHealth doesn't make sense.

1687
02:11:18,897 --> 02:11:26,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, everybody leaving, how did you ever approve being on mass health, I mean being on GIC if everybody has to leave the room?

1688
02:11:29,485 --> 02:11:35,450
[SPEAKER_13]: The other changes, increasing the yearly GIC deductible to 500 per individual.

1689
02:11:36,235 --> 02:11:44,840
[SPEAKER_13]: It was 250, then it went to three, then it went to three twice a year, so now it's 500 per individual, 1,000 for a family.

1690
02:11:45,581 --> 02:11:49,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Fallon Health, 550 per individual, 1,100 per family.

1691
02:11:50,924 --> 02:11:56,287
[SPEAKER_13]: They added a prescription drug deductible of 100 per individual, 200 per family.

1692
02:11:56,768 --> 02:11:57,308
[SPEAKER_13]: What's next?

1693
02:11:58,709 --> 02:12:00,530
[SPEAKER_13]: The Group Insurance Commission will conduct

1694
02:12:01,337 --> 02:12:11,185
[SPEAKER_13]: a very important public hearing February 1st at 1230 on the sixth floor of the Charles Hurley building at 19 Stanaford Street, Boston.

1695
02:12:11,846 --> 02:12:16,850
[SPEAKER_13]: The room location hasn't been assigned because they're anticipating a large crowd.

1696
02:12:18,712 --> 02:12:26,238
[SPEAKER_13]: This hearing presents an important opportunity for the members to speak out against the unfair cost shifting changes

1697
02:12:26,981 --> 02:12:32,726
[SPEAKER_13]: because the commissioners will take a final vote before their next meeting, which is scheduled for February 9th.

1698
02:12:33,286 --> 02:12:34,787
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always in the winter.

1699
02:12:34,887 --> 02:12:39,551
[SPEAKER_13]: The last time they changed everything, there was a blizzard and a snow advisory, and you weren't told to travel.

1700
02:12:40,132 --> 02:12:41,493
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's when everything was changed.

1701
02:12:42,594 --> 02:12:49,059
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to do all we can to defeat these increases to health insurance for all public employees and retirees.

1702
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:51,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Wake up, Medford.

1703
02:12:51,921 --> 02:12:55,905
[SPEAKER_13]: February 1st, have your voices heard at this meeting.

1704
02:12:56,859 --> 02:13:02,903
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't have your voices heard and you don't participate, don't complain later when the changes occur.

1705
02:13:03,804 --> 02:13:04,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Wake up.

1706
02:13:05,305 --> 02:13:05,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1707
02:13:06,746 --> 02:13:07,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1708
02:13:08,507 --> 02:13:09,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President.

1709
02:13:09,287 --> 02:13:10,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address of the record, please.

1710
02:13:10,448 --> 02:13:11,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Bob Pinter again, Zero Summit Road.

1711
02:13:12,229 --> 02:13:12,890
[SPEAKER_12]: A quick question.

1712
02:13:13,070 --> 02:13:13,970
[SPEAKER_12]: He just jogged my mind.

1713
02:13:14,271 --> 02:13:16,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked you, and hopefully through your chair, you will ask that question.

1714
02:13:17,073 --> 02:13:18,954
[SPEAKER_12]: The second part of the question should have been as follows.

1715
02:13:19,294 --> 02:13:25,158
[SPEAKER_12]: If, in fact, we go to this unilateral, if GIC goes to unilaterally, does that mean the local legislative body

1716
02:13:25,503 --> 02:13:28,765
[SPEAKER_12]: has to make an approval on what the mayor, the executive officer would do.

1717
02:13:29,085 --> 02:13:30,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause that's going to be extremely important.

1718
02:13:30,846 --> 02:13:33,828
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the requirement back in 2011 when we accepted it.

1719
02:13:34,289 --> 02:13:36,910
[SPEAKER_12]: But now the six and a half year contract is going to be over.

1720
02:13:37,330 --> 02:13:38,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody knows what that language is going to be.

1721
02:13:39,332 --> 02:13:43,414
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it would be incumbent, hopefully upon you, Mr. President, to ask both of those questions.

1722
02:13:43,854 --> 02:13:52,600
[SPEAKER_12]: If GIC goes to a unilateral program and if the city of Medford were to go in that direction, does the mayor unilaterally do it or does she need support?

1723
02:13:52,962 --> 02:13:55,883
[SPEAKER_12]: from all 14 union people for approval before the council.

1724
02:13:55,943 --> 02:14:04,508
[SPEAKER_04]: For what I understand on February 3rd, the mayor will be meeting with the city unions to discuss the GIC options and other possibilities of possibly going out.

1725
02:14:04,588 --> 02:14:05,988
[SPEAKER_05]: But the meeting is February 1st.

1726
02:14:06,729 --> 02:14:11,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm told it as being a February 3rd with the city unions.

1727
02:14:11,451 --> 02:14:12,431
[SPEAKER_12]: So could you ask that question?

1728
02:14:12,612 --> 02:14:14,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Could somebody put that question forward?

1729
02:14:15,213 --> 02:14:19,635
[SPEAKER_12]: The question is if the city, if GIC adopts the unilateral program,

1730
02:14:20,547 --> 02:14:23,908
[SPEAKER_12]: does that mean the chief executive officer of a city be in this case of mayor?

1731
02:14:24,788 --> 02:14:40,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Can she independently make changes which could possibly be cost shift changes to retirees as well as employees if the city opts out to go to a different union type of a different healthcare provider?

1732
02:14:40,433 --> 02:14:41,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully we'll have all that information for you.

1733
02:14:43,454 --> 02:14:44,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you know something I don't know.

1734
02:14:44,714 --> 02:14:46,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I don't have GAC.

1735
02:14:46,555 --> 02:14:47,155
[SPEAKER_05]: My deductible is $2,500.

1736
02:14:49,305 --> 02:14:49,825
[SPEAKER_05]: for a person.

1737
02:14:50,485 --> 02:14:51,685
[SPEAKER_04]: So I love the FGAC.

1738
02:14:51,965 --> 02:14:53,886
[SPEAKER_04]: So will you ask those questions?

1739
02:14:53,926 --> 02:14:59,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I will do the best I can for you on the motion by councilor Falco to receive and place on file.

1740
02:15:00,427 --> 02:15:01,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me.

1741
02:15:02,407 --> 02:15:02,727
[SPEAKER_04]: May I?

1742
02:15:03,188 --> 02:15:03,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you may.

1743
02:15:04,128 --> 02:15:04,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1744
02:15:04,588 --> 02:15:05,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor.

1745
02:15:05,048 --> 02:15:08,889
[SPEAKER_08]: President Caraviello, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing street, Medford.

1746
02:15:09,949 --> 02:15:16,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this insurance stuff for the lack of a better word is way over my head.

1747
02:15:18,781 --> 02:15:26,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can understand why they have the tallest building in Boston and Hartford, Connecticut, and stable of attorneys working in their buildings.

1748
02:15:29,444 --> 02:15:47,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what happened here, but if I'm not mistaken, I had read a political leader's statement in the local newspaper, the transcript, some six years ago, thereabouts, saying if we select

1749
02:15:48,817 --> 02:15:57,139
[SPEAKER_08]: the GIC insurance versus what we had, what I have from my wife, we're a school teacher and was tough total health.

1750
02:15:57,179 --> 02:16:01,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that we was, we counseled Dello Russo.

1751
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:11,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the top leader was quoted in six years ago that we were going to save $5 million annually exalted.

1752
02:16:13,241 --> 02:16:16,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the 5 million seems to be exalted also per annum.

1753
02:16:17,328 --> 02:16:19,089
[SPEAKER_08]: times 6.5 years, maybe.

1754
02:16:20,949 --> 02:16:22,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand what's going on.

1755
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:41,257
[SPEAKER_08]: If we save $5 million a year, first of all, I told my wife, I don't need her master's degree to figure out for such a great deal in savings through the Corporation of Massachusetts, GIC, that I said, you watch.

1756
02:16:42,378 --> 02:16:45,939
[SPEAKER_08]: The co-pays, the doctor's visits,

1757
02:16:48,731 --> 02:16:54,054
[SPEAKER_08]: And the monthly costs will be going up again after the 6.5 years.

1758
02:16:54,854 --> 02:16:57,436
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't see the $5 million savings.

1759
02:16:59,637 --> 02:17:01,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Did our real estate taxes go down?

1760
02:17:03,299 --> 02:17:08,181
[SPEAKER_08]: No, probably went up $2.5 million per year for the last five years, approximate.

1761
02:17:09,382 --> 02:17:13,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's a lot of money.

1762
02:17:13,985 --> 02:17:18,407
[SPEAKER_08]: $5 million savings, not having to spend the extra $5 million on health insurance,

1763
02:17:18,811 --> 02:17:26,016
[SPEAKER_08]: for the city itself, yeah, that's $32 million totaled at the end of this year.

1764
02:17:26,696 --> 02:17:33,180
[SPEAKER_08]: And our real estate tax is going up in that time span, probably at least 2 million times 6, 12 million.

1765
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:35,662
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's like a lot of money.

1766
02:17:35,722 --> 02:17:40,825
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like $50 million we're talking, but yet we don't even save a dime in real estate taxes.

1767
02:17:41,821 --> 02:17:49,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And furthermore, our new growth is never applied to offset the Prop 2.49% increases.

1768
02:17:50,145 --> 02:17:52,045
[SPEAKER_08]: So what good is this new growth?

1769
02:17:53,026 --> 02:17:54,186
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't help our city.

1770
02:17:54,607 --> 02:17:57,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always said I am not- Mr. Pesce, we're talking about health insurance.

1771
02:17:58,648 --> 02:17:59,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1772
02:17:59,209 --> 02:18:00,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Not real estate.

1773
02:18:00,789 --> 02:18:01,570
[SPEAKER_08]: And the cost.

1774
02:18:02,910 --> 02:18:07,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so it all comes down to health insurance, $5 million a year savings.

1775
02:18:08,373 --> 02:18:11,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Can someone educate me and show me where that money went?

1776
02:18:12,297 --> 02:18:16,279
[SPEAKER_08]: and we never even adopted the owner-occupied real estate taxes exemption.

1777
02:18:16,559 --> 02:18:22,941
[SPEAKER_08]: The point is we say $5 million a year, real estate taxes go up $2 million a year, something is amiss.

1778
02:18:24,722 --> 02:18:32,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Can someone help me as I pay thousands of dollars every year for real estate tax, can someone tell me where this money went?

1779
02:18:33,426 --> 02:18:34,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone, anyone.

1780
02:18:36,347 --> 02:18:37,127
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we get?

1781
02:18:38,948 --> 02:18:41,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody, does anybody know where the money went?

1782
02:18:44,725 --> 02:18:45,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Dello Russo says aye.

1783
02:18:46,265 --> 02:18:47,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he get the money?

1784
02:18:47,606 --> 02:18:47,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1785
02:18:47,906 --> 02:18:48,246
[SPEAKER_08]: He may have.

1786
02:18:48,266 --> 02:18:48,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1787
02:18:48,726 --> 02:18:49,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't answer that.

1788
02:18:49,606 --> 02:18:50,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand.

1789
02:18:50,626 --> 02:18:52,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is the $5 million savings?

1790
02:18:52,607 --> 02:18:53,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the $5 million savings is.

1791
02:18:53,587 --> 02:18:54,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for answering my question.

1792
02:18:54,767 --> 02:18:55,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1793
02:18:55,768 --> 02:18:57,708
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo.

1794
02:18:59,209 --> 02:18:59,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1795
02:19:01,149 --> 02:19:03,109
[SPEAKER_02]: That the paper be received and placed on file.

1796
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:05,110
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor?

1797
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:05,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1798
02:19:06,170 --> 02:19:06,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1799
02:19:09,271 --> 02:19:09,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

1800
02:19:13,891 --> 02:19:17,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the chair seems to be in doubt, it won't be a quorum.

1801
02:19:18,315 --> 02:19:21,718
[SPEAKER_04]: We need four to vote to pass.

1802
02:19:22,419 --> 02:19:25,762
[SPEAKER_15]: We only have three people here.

1803
02:19:25,802 --> 02:19:26,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Received and placed on file.

1804
02:19:26,682 --> 02:19:28,944
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be no, procedurally there should be no motion.

1805
02:19:29,265 --> 02:19:30,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a public petition.

1806
02:19:30,986 --> 02:19:34,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a- Received and placed on file.

1807
02:19:34,710 --> 02:19:36,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a minute, I asked for a motion.

1808
02:19:37,623 --> 02:19:40,304
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be placed on file, because that's the problem around here.

1809
02:19:40,344 --> 02:19:42,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Just take everything and place it on file.

1810
02:19:42,145 --> 02:19:44,706
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a motion to ask, and you said you were going to pursue it.

1811
02:19:45,266 --> 02:19:46,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should be filing the motion.

1812
02:19:46,647 --> 02:19:50,808
[SPEAKER_05]: We only have three votes.

1813
02:19:50,828 --> 02:19:51,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked the President.

1814
02:19:51,809 --> 02:19:52,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, excuse me.

1815
02:19:52,849 --> 02:19:53,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked the President.

1816
02:19:54,570 --> 02:19:55,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in charge here.

1817
02:19:55,450 --> 02:19:56,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that, but I asked you.

1818
02:19:56,571 --> 02:19:58,111
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'll decide.

1819
02:19:58,131 --> 02:19:58,792
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the decision?

1820
02:19:59,612 --> 02:20:02,593
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to receive it and place it on file, and we will get an answer.

1821
02:20:03,053 --> 02:20:03,974
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you do that, Rick?

1822
02:20:04,014 --> 02:20:04,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me.

1823
02:20:04,294 --> 02:20:06,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, motion to return

1824
02:20:07,648 --> 02:20:09,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

1825
02:20:09,729 --> 02:20:10,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1826
02:20:10,409 --> 02:20:12,509
[SPEAKER_05]: You ought to understand how the chair works, Rick, okay?

1827
02:20:12,529 --> 02:20:13,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand how the chair works.

1828
02:20:14,350 --> 02:20:15,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Only the people behind the rail make room.

1829
02:20:16,390 --> 02:20:18,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you were asked to make a motion.

1830
02:20:18,951 --> 02:20:19,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't make a motion.

1831
02:20:19,811 --> 02:20:20,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you can.

1832
02:20:20,291 --> 02:20:20,992
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not the chair.

1833
02:20:21,032 --> 02:20:22,072
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not allowed to make a motion.

1834
02:20:22,932 --> 02:20:24,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to return to regular business.

1835
02:20:24,733 --> 02:20:24,953
Second.

1836
02:20:26,213 --> 02:20:26,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1837
02:20:27,433 --> 02:20:35,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn, are you... Offered by Councilor Marks be it resolved that the freight trains traveling through West Medford be discussed.

1838
02:20:35,556 --> 02:20:35,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

1839
02:20:39,057 --> 02:20:40,938
[SPEAKER_16]: He's over there.

1840
02:20:40,958 --> 02:20:41,598
[SPEAKER_16]: You got me on this.

1841
02:20:41,678 --> 02:20:41,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Wrong one.

1842
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:44,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1843
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:52,645
[SPEAKER_15]: We all received an email from a West Medford resident regarding the frequency of freight trains going through West Medford Square.

1844
02:20:53,266 --> 02:20:57,669
[SPEAKER_15]: And according to this gentleman, there's been an increase over the last several months.

1845
02:20:58,409 --> 02:21:00,971
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's really troubling to him.

1846
02:21:01,431 --> 02:21:14,214
[SPEAKER_15]: and many of the neighbors because the freight trains are much heavier than the commuter trains and it's shaking homes, Mr. President, and spilling out a lot of diesel smoke into the neighborhood.

1847
02:21:14,594 --> 02:21:26,597
[SPEAKER_15]: So I promised the neighbor that I would bring it up, the resident, and ask for a response back, Mr. President, on freight trains that are coming through.

1848
02:21:26,617 --> 02:21:29,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there more frequent freight trains coming through?

1849
02:21:30,042 --> 02:21:37,083
[SPEAKER_15]: the commuter line, and what is the frequency, and for what purpose, Mr. President, and if we can get a report back.

1850
02:21:37,243 --> 02:21:38,964
[SPEAKER_04]: We will get a report from the DOT.

1851
02:21:39,204 --> 02:21:41,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, if you could ask the DOT for a report.

1852
02:21:41,784 --> 02:21:42,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1853
02:21:42,964 --> 02:21:46,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I was in receipt of the same email.

1854
02:21:46,505 --> 02:21:52,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gravely concerned for any increase in the air of diesel particulates.

1855
02:21:53,166 --> 02:21:55,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I happen to live in that neighborhood.

1856
02:21:55,947 --> 02:21:57,747
[SPEAKER_02]: These pose a grave health

1857
02:21:59,035 --> 02:22:00,156
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, danger to people.

1858
02:22:00,736 --> 02:22:10,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it was one of the most, uh, important things that we studied, uh, in the process of, uh, the expansion of the Green Line and moving the tracks closer to people's houses.

1859
02:22:11,124 --> 02:22:14,786
[SPEAKER_02]: People suffer greatly from, uh, this type of intoxication.

1860
02:22:15,207 --> 02:22:25,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd further point out, Mr. President, that I'm not satisfied with some of the standards that are adopted in this matter by the Federal, uh, Transportation Department.

1861
02:22:25,814 --> 02:22:27,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

1862
02:22:27,155 --> 02:22:28,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1863
02:22:28,627 --> 02:22:30,729
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank Councilor Markswell for bringing that up.

1864
02:22:30,789 --> 02:22:38,476
[SPEAKER_14]: I too got the email and I did put an email into our friendly transportation buddy, Tom.

1865
02:22:38,656 --> 02:22:40,638
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully we get something back soon.

1866
02:22:40,718 --> 02:22:41,458
[SPEAKER_14]: I did the same.

1867
02:22:41,599 --> 02:22:41,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1868
02:22:44,099 --> 02:22:53,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Mr. President, I'm wondering if we can request an opinion from the solicitor to see what restrictions we can place on noise levels of trains that travel down our roadway after certain hours.

1869
02:22:53,702 --> 02:22:54,982
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to ask the question of the solicitor.

1870
02:22:55,002 --> 02:23:00,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Being a resident of the neighbourhood, I have noticed the, earlier in the morning, I have seen the freight trains come through in the morning.

1871
02:23:00,524 --> 02:23:02,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't noticed them in the evening, though, but I have seen them in the morning.

1872
02:23:03,765 --> 02:23:04,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1873
02:23:04,165 --> 02:23:05,706
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Knight.

1874
02:23:06,006 --> 02:23:06,746
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favour?

1875
02:23:06,766 --> 02:23:09,847
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Marks.

1876
02:23:09,907 --> 02:23:11,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, on the motion of Councilor Marks.

02:23:12,008 --> 02:23:12,548
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favour?

[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favour?

[SPEAKER_04]: I motion passes offered by council and I be it resolved that the Medford city council wish Robert Vasquez a happy 60th birthday council and I, uh, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1880
02:23:30,496 --> 02:23:36,640
[SPEAKER_16]: This week marks the 60th year on this God's great earth for Mr. Roberto Vasquez of Sylvia road.

1881
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:41,003
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, over the weekend I was fortunate enough to be invited to attend his birthday party.

1882
02:23:41,541 --> 02:23:46,445
[SPEAKER_16]: and I just wanted to wish him once again another happy 60 years here in the city of Medford.

1883
02:23:47,025 --> 02:23:47,825
[SPEAKER_16]: He's a great gentleman.

1884
02:23:47,846 --> 02:23:52,169
[SPEAKER_16]: He's lived down on Sylvia Road for the majority of time that he's been here in the country.

1885
02:23:52,289 --> 02:23:54,850
[SPEAKER_16]: He resides from Tripoli and made Medford his home.

1886
02:23:54,890 --> 02:24:01,415
[SPEAKER_16]: He was a business owner in the community for a number of years, Mr. President, and it's with great happiness that I make this motion and ask my council colleagues to support it.

1887
02:24:01,995 --> 02:24:02,556
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor?

1888
02:24:02,576 --> 02:24:03,336

1891
02:24:10,408 --> 02:24:16,870
[SPEAKER_04]: extends its steep and sincere condolences to the family of Laurie Esnaldi on her recent passing.

1892
02:24:17,110 --> 02:24:17,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1893
02:24:18,391 --> 02:24:20,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, this is a joint resolution.

1894
02:24:20,192 --> 02:24:21,112
[SPEAKER_16]: I defer to the senior member.

1895
02:24:22,112 --> 02:24:23,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1896
02:24:23,333 --> 02:24:28,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, let's just keep in mind the Esnaldi family and pray for the repose of Laurie.

1897
02:24:29,915 --> 02:24:30,875
[SPEAKER_02]: A very good family.

1898
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:32,176
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a wonderful person.

1899
02:24:32,855 --> 02:24:36,337
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, died too young after suffering from a debilitating sickness.

1900
02:24:37,097 --> 02:24:38,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, she comes from good stock.

1901
02:24:39,718 --> 02:24:49,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, she brought happiness to a lot of people and she will be missed by her family and a wonderful group of neighbors on Stanley.

1902
02:24:50,843 --> 02:24:51,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Toro.

1903
02:24:51,663 --> 02:24:55,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So if, excuse me, if we could all rise for a moment of silence, please.

1904
02:25:06,690 --> 02:25:07,190
[SPEAKER_04]: The Ricketts.

1905
02:25:09,292 --> 02:25:10,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

1906
02:25:11,213 --> 02:25:21,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, do we had a correspondence from the mayor, um, in a package, uh, this, this week, uh, well, actually it's, uh, I'm sorry.

1907
02:25:21,399 --> 02:25:34,887
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from a Lauren D Lorenzo, the, um, director of community development says given the continued concern with the potential project, uh, and they referenced, uh, city council resolution 16-seven nine nine, which I believe was, uh,

1908
02:25:35,496 --> 02:25:36,577
[SPEAKER_09]: the Malden Hospital.

1909
02:25:46,605 --> 02:25:54,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Her recommendation is the City Council invite representatives of Pine Hills and the DCR to a Committee of the Whole meeting.

1910
02:25:54,592 --> 02:26:04,000
[SPEAKER_09]: This should allow residents and Councils the opportunity to address the project proponent directly and to allow DCR to listen to the existing

1911
02:26:04,507 --> 02:26:05,948
[SPEAKER_09]: existing and potential issues.

1912
02:26:06,968 --> 02:26:13,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, she says that, uh, I have left a message for Tony green of pine Hills to see if he's willing to attend a meeting in Medford.

1913
02:26:13,731 --> 02:26:19,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, then she concludes by saying if the council would like to pursue or like her to pursue this, uh, please let her know.

1914
02:26:19,973 --> 02:26:23,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I know I definitely think we should pursue this.

1915
02:26:24,335 --> 02:26:29,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, if we, we should definitely, I mean, I know, uh, console long ago, uh, current and the console, Scarpelli and myself,

1916
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:39,140
[SPEAKER_09]: have been working on the Malden hospital ad hoc committee and we would definitely, not to speak for everyone, but we would definitely like to request a meeting with the developer.

1917
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:43,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, if you could make the call to the developer and let me know of some potential dates.

1918
02:26:44,723 --> 02:26:45,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1919
02:26:45,723 --> 02:26:55,788
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know if we can with that, I know that a city solicitor is getting back to us about the recommendation cause I believe our constituents have asked about the AG's input

1920
02:26:56,421 --> 02:27:01,503
[SPEAKER_14]: and recommendation on the health care issue along with that.

1921
02:27:01,703 --> 02:27:05,464
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I believe we're looking to try to have a meeting at St.

1922
02:27:05,504 --> 02:27:12,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Francis, so it would be easier for the neighbors in that area to get to that meeting.

1923
02:27:12,227 --> 02:27:15,148
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we can just add that to that, I'd appreciate it.

1924
02:27:15,348 --> 02:27:16,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Scott-Milley.

1925
02:27:17,089 --> 02:27:25,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd say, Mr. Clerk, if you could let me know some potential dates that the developer could come down, and we'd be more than happy to have a special meeting.

1926
02:27:28,207 --> 02:27:28,647
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor?

1927
02:27:29,627 --> 02:27:31,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1928
02:27:32,148 --> 02:27:35,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Scott, if you could inform Eddie who the developer is.

1929
02:27:35,969 --> 02:27:39,130
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like, according to the letter, it sounds like.

1930
02:27:40,931 --> 02:27:45,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can get Laura DeLaRanza, if you could ask Laura DeLaRanza.

1931
02:27:47,253 --> 02:27:48,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you could, I'd appreciate it.

1932
02:27:49,734 --> 02:27:57,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we close tonight, I think we heard from many of the residents, regards to the zoning and ordinance.

1933
02:27:58,430 --> 02:28:18,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight, Councilor Dello Russo, and Councilor Falco, if you could, I know you've got other things also on the calendar there, but if you could schedule a zoning meeting at the earliest of your convenience, if the committee would be, whether it be in the neighborhood or here, the chair would appreciate it.

1934
02:28:20,625 --> 02:28:21,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me say this,

1935
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:32,807
[SPEAKER_04]: These last two years, these seven members in different subcommittees have met more than I've ever met in my five years in the council.

1936
02:28:32,827 --> 02:28:37,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So I commend the whole body for the work in the subcommittees that they've done for the last year and a half.

1937
02:28:40,172 --> 02:28:43,034
[SPEAKER_04]: The minutes were passed to Councilor Knight.

1938
02:28:43,535 --> 02:28:44,856
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you find those minutes?

1939
02:28:46,457 --> 02:28:48,799
[SPEAKER_04]: The minutes are in order and I move for approval thereof.

1940
02:28:49,848 --> 02:28:50,591
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1941
02:28:50,751 --> 02:28:51,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1942
02:28:51,775 --> 02:28:53,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1943
02:28:55,728 --> 02:28:56,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting adjourned.
