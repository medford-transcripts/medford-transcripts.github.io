[SPEAKER_02]: Please join us to rise in saluting the flag.

18
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:42,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:43,586
[SPEAKER_02]: 16-740 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

20
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:48,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send condolences to the family of Leona Greenwood.

21
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:53,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Leona was a Medford traffic supervisor for 34 years.

22
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:56,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Her presence and service to our community will be missed.

23
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:02,566
[SPEAKER_02]: In the absence of Councilor Caraviello, Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

24
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:12,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, the Greenwood family have been part of the Memphic community for as long as I can remember.

25
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:20,871
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see Mrs. Greenwood, she battled through a very difficult disease and she'd still be out there in the street.

26
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:24,159
[SPEAKER_08]: making sure our kids are safe.

27
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:31,944
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bob worked very hard with our youth soccer organization, and I'm sure that his missus was right beside him.

28
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:36,748
[SPEAKER_08]: So she'll be greatly missed and send our condolences.

29
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:39,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Please join us in a moment of silence.

30
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Please rise.

31
00:01:53,268 --> 00:02:09,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I was informed by officials in the city clerk's office that 16-741 was withdrawn by the petitioner, so it is withdrawn with all prejudice on that motion or on the motion of Councilor Knight.

32
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:10,535
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

33
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:13,136
[SPEAKER_02]: All those?

34
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:17,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Councilor, Vice President Langlois-Kern for suspension of the rules.

35
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,459
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

36
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,919
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

37
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion granted.

38
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:25,531
[SPEAKER_02]: 16-743 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

39
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:33,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the administration provide the city council with an update regarding the aircraft noise that is getting worse in our community.

40
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:48,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved that we receive an update on what has been done, how the administration is making this a priority, and what will continue to be done for the tens of thousands of residents that are negatively affected on a daily basis.

41
00:02:48,632 --> 00:03:00,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Vice President, if I can point out, we've been just running into some scheduling conflicts with Mr. Attorney Gliona, who's representing the city on the board at Massport.

42
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:01,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Vice President.

43
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

44
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I put this on.

45
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:13,624
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably like my fourth or fifth resolution in the last several months with regards to the airport noise.

46
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:16,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we have asked Mr. Gliona to come to the council.

47
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:24,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand he must be busy, and I understand there's meetings that maybe have been postponed.

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:36,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I just still feel that after a few months, we should have some sort of update, either from the administration, with regards to what the administration has done, or from our representative on the Massport Commission.

49
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:42,106
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem, obviously, is one that we've been getting complaints about.

50
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:46,128
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lot last summer, and then this summer it got worse.

51
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:55,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from what I understand, because we have lane 33L that was put in place, which is why we started getting the air traffic over the last couple of years.

52
00:03:55,668 --> 00:04:01,492
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what I understand, Logan used runway 15 for arrivals actually this weekend.

53
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,713
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a second runway.

54
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:06,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the planes came over Medford, mainly Medford Heights.

55
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:07,516
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still affecting 26.

56
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:10,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Both lanes are affecting 26,000 to 30,000 residents in Medford.

57
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:17,076
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems like Medford really doesn't have a hand at the table.

58
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:18,757
[SPEAKER_06]: We never have.

59
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:24,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really hoping that the new administration will start to get a grasp and get a seat at the table.

60
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,502
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a big meeting coming up on the 18th.

61
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:37,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did email the mayor's office to make sure a representative or two or three from Medford would be there with a handful of other communities that are facing the same problem.

62
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:41,869
[SPEAKER_06]: If we don't have a seat at that table, it's only going to get worse.

63
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:47,108
[SPEAKER_06]: The city or town of Milton is really on top of the issue.

64
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:54,410
[SPEAKER_06]: They're complaining, and Massport did relocate over the weekend lane 15, which now was coming over Medford.

65
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,911
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that continues on top of the 33L, we're in for nightly noise.

66
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:05,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when I hear it, it's every three minutes for hours at a time.

67
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:08,773
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm starting to hear it every single day or night.

68
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,633
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really becoming a disturbance.

69
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:15,204
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm getting a lot of complaints about it, but we still, I don't think, have enough support.

70
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:27,386
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the people need to understand what needs to be done, and nobody's really informing the public on what needs to be done, where we need to complain to, how we get our information, and that's something that this administration has to lead on.

71
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,346
[SPEAKER_06]: We've asked numerous times for updates.

72
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:40,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hope that the mayor and some other representative will be at that meeting on the 18th, and I believe it's in Somerville, but we really need to start taking this

73
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:47,979
[SPEAKER_06]: extremely seriously before we're the only ones that aren't complaining and we're getting traffic non-stop 24 hours a day.

74
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:49,640
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my fear.

75
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's already a nuisance for so many.

76
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:58,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, creating headaches and anxiety and problems for a number of people that have called and complained to me.

77
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:01,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just really hope that we can get an update.

78
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:05,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Gliona obviously has never come to the council.

79
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:06,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that there's

80
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:15,356
[SPEAKER_06]: possible meeting problems, but we should have some sort of update from at least our administration to say, this is what's going on.

81
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,516
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we're involved.

82
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,497
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we're doing.

83
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:18,977
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the meetings we're going to.

84
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:20,518
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we're fighting this.

85
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:27,100
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we're saying to Massport and the FAA, we need some relief because we really do need some relief.

86
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there's anybody here in the audience that wants to talk about it, but it's a serious problem.

87
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:35,023
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is, especially in North Medford and the Heights.

88
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:36,484
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope we can,

89
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:39,496
[SPEAKER_06]: get some resolution on that.

90
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:41,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

91
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:43,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

92
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:51,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also just like to state, um, I received a number of calls this weekend as well regarding the, uh, airplane noise over the Heights.

93
00:06:51,224 --> 00:07:02,191
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gotten to a point where it's, it's really, it just seems like it's constant and something needs to be done, but we need to, we do need to get some sort of an update from the administration and from, uh, uh, our representative at Massport.

94
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So I definitely support this resolution.

95
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that needs to be looked at.

96
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:06,494
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been waiting for a while.

97
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:12,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we could definitely support the resolution and it's just something that we need to look at as soon as possible.

98
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:13,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

99
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:14,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

100
00:07:14,204 --> 00:07:14,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor.

101
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:16,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

102
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:16,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

103
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:18,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

104
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:20,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

105
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:26,609
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 21 Park Street, which I created a Facebook tag this weekend called Logan Airport Medford.

106
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the planes are especially loud after the 11 p.m.

107
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:36,958
[SPEAKER_00]: hour, between 11 and about 1140, we get planes in about one to one and a half minute intervals.

108
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,819
[SPEAKER_00]: We also get the 6 a.m.

109
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:39,239
[SPEAKER_00]: wake-up.

110
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:45,701
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the sixth day in a row that we've had both those times as well as the during the day times.

111
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:54,063
[SPEAKER_00]: When I pick my daughter up at school at the Roberts, which is on Park Street as well, conversations often cease as a plane flies overhead quite low.

112
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:58,265
[SPEAKER_00]: We all look up, see the windows of the plane.

113
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the kids wave.

114
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:00,405
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very low.

115
00:08:00,465 --> 00:08:01,225
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very loud.

116
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:01,906
[SPEAKER_00]: It's intense.

117
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:03,666
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter has migraines.

118
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:06,067
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going back to the doctor in two weeks.

119
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:11,472
[SPEAKER_00]: to have her medication increased that they believe was started because of the planes.

120
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:14,034
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm experiencing headaches and issues.

121
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:21,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Sleep interruption is serious, and in a prolonged amount of time, it can really lead to health issues.

122
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need relief.

123
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:35,030
[SPEAKER_00]: The other towns are rallying and complaining, and we really need a better format than that form online that you fill in and say what time it's loud, and they send you a letter that says,

124
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's an airport.

125
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:38,989
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really an answer.

126
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:45,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to find a way to be more vocal and involved in this problem and try to get us some relief.

127
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:47,235
[SPEAKER_00]: I know other towns have been quite successful.

128
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:50,437
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have to do is we have to be the squeaky wheel.

129
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:52,819
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be loud and we have to get some help.

130
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:55,984
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really have to do it before it gets worse.

131
00:08:56,004 --> 00:09:00,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as these other communities get help, if we're not there, then they say, you know what?

132
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:00,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford's not here.

133
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,949
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just fly those extra planes over you.

134
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,571
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that town can get some relief.

135
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:06,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to suffer more.

136
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:07,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

137
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:09,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

138
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:11,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

139
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:12,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

140
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:14,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

141
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:21,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to come up in support of the request.

142
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:26,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the situation is progressively getting more dire.

143
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:34,228
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been times in the past few weeks when it has been so loud, so late at night, it's disrupted sleep.

144
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,129
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is terrible.

145
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:39,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we've always been a city that the planes have flown over.

146
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:44,804
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can remember when I was much younger, they flew much higher.

147
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:51,549
[SPEAKER_01]: And it feels like that band that they're traveling is getting tighter and tighter, and we're getting more and more of it.

148
00:09:52,649 --> 00:10:01,997
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would echo the thoughts that if we do not find a way to become more vocal as a city, we're going to get the majority of the traffic.

149
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:08,381
[SPEAKER_01]: But it definitely is becoming quite difficult to get a good night's sleep in our neighborhood and in our area.

150
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:09,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

151
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:09,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

152
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:13,530
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion for approval by vice president, low current is seconded by council Falco.

153
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:16,553
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor of roll call has been requested.

154
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:17,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Marks, Councilor.

155
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:22,158
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank a council longer current for bringing up this important issue.

156
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:28,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I know council Longo current has brought this up many times as well as many members behind this railing.

157
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:34,408
[SPEAKER_09]: And a part of my frustration, Mr. President is the fact that, uh, the mayor points,

158
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:38,357
[SPEAKER_09]: a person to sit on the advisory board for Massport.

159
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:56,367
[SPEAKER_09]: And over the years, in my research, the advisory board position, and this excludes the most recent appointment of Attorney Gliona, that appointment in the past never attended meetings at Massport.

160
00:10:57,288 --> 00:11:03,051
[SPEAKER_09]: We asked the previous person that was in that role, again, to appear before the Medford City Council

161
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:04,347
[SPEAKER_09]: to give us an update.

162
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:13,691
[SPEAKER_09]: That person, for whatever reason, the appointment of the mayor, refused to come before this council to give us an update on a very important issue in this community.

163
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:17,892
[SPEAKER_09]: This council has voted 7-0 on at least three occasions.

164
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:26,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I offered three separate resolutions to ask Massport to look at the noise detectors that are located throughout the city of Medford.

165
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:37,704
[SPEAKER_09]: And to see, Mr. President, if they can strategically be relocated in areas that are experiencing this particular additional noise, as we heard the heights, Salt Method.

166
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:43,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I live in the Wellington area, and I can tell you this weekend, they were overhead every three minutes the same way, very low.

167
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,687
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's throughout the entire community.

168
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:52,869
[SPEAKER_09]: And we asked a simple request, Mr. President, and it's a shame that Massport

169
00:11:53,239 --> 00:12:05,946
[SPEAKER_09]: for whatever reason, is not considering this community as part of the advisory board and really has done very little to nothing to address some of the concerns.

170
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:13,810
[SPEAKER_09]: We even asked for a representative of Massport to appear before this council to answer some of the questions we had, Mr. President.

171
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure what it's gonna take.

172
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:21,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this latest representative that's on the board, although he's a very capable person,

173
00:12:22,564 --> 00:12:24,186
[SPEAKER_09]: He said they have yet to call for a meeting.

174
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:33,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what insight he can give to this council, but it's about time that the mayor of this community, Mr. President, step up on this issue.

175
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:38,278
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been an issue for years and years and years in this community.

176
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:39,499
[SPEAKER_09]: This is nothing new.

177
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,945
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I don't know, Mr. President, maybe we need to circulate a petition.

178
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:48,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we need to have

179
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,004
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, you know, a walk on City Hall to try to discuss this issue.

180
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:59,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe something needs to happen to move this city and getting involved.

181
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:03,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with the comments made by my colleagues to get involved with the dialogue.

182
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:10,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Other communities are receiving relief in the way of new windows and homes, Mr. President.

183
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realize their homes in Winthrop in East Boston

184
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:17,488
[SPEAKER_09]: and directly abutting the airport.

185
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:22,331
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's other mitigating factors that could be done, Mr. President, to

186
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:26,234
[SPEAKER_09]: residents of this community that are experiencing noise.

187
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:37,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, if you have a dog next door living to your back and too much, you can call the police department and they'll come out and they'll knock the door and say, please, your dog is being a disturbance.

188
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,797
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's against city ordinance.

189
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:47,580
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can have, you know, these planes over your head, you know, 300 feet over your head every three minutes at one, two, three in the morning.

190
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,100
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not a disturbance.

191
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:51,281
[SPEAKER_09]: It just doesn't make any sense to me.

192
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:52,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

193
00:13:52,337 --> 00:14:04,645
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, I would ask that, uh, we call for an emergency meeting, uh, with the mayor of this community, uh, sit down and discuss this issue and what our plan of attack is to address this with Massport.

194
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:05,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

195
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:05,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

196
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:06,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

197
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,307
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion.

198
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:10,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

199
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:10,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

200
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:12,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

201
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:12,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

202
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:13,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Constable Russo.

203
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:14,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Andrew Kass.

204
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:15,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at a Cushman street method.

205
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:18,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I just drove in from the house.

206
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:19,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I started to watch him.

207
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:19,855
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd hope I,

208
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,359
[SPEAKER_07]: not redundant on some of the things I might want to say.

209
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:34,548
[SPEAKER_07]: This airport noise is becoming problematic to some degree and to other people on a high elevation.

210
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:35,769
[SPEAKER_07]: It's even worse, I'm sure.

211
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially, it seems to me, maybe it's my imagination, but it's pretty quiet some evenings from 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

212
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:50,161
[SPEAKER_07]: When it's time to think about the midnight hour, they seem to kick in, which is very odd.

213
00:14:50,658 --> 00:15:00,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think at a midnight hour, even Logan Airport being as busy as it is in the world market, maybe they don't have as many, I would think, flights at that hour.

214
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:15,484
[SPEAKER_07]: They should be able, I would think, common sense, but I am not that smart, to just fly or especially take off over the ocean, head east, and then make their turns if they have to.

215
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:18,325
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be common sense, I would think.

216
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:30,218
[SPEAKER_07]: As I reiterated in the past, it seems to me when they were proposing to build runway, I believe Brianna mentioned 33 L is that correct?

217
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:30,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

218
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:41,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that was, would be the time for us to make, uh, our comments to mass port.

219
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:48,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Although as I said in the past, unless we had the power of tip O'Neill, I don't think we're going to be able to tell mass port what to do.

220
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:57,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, having said all of that, Councilor March brought up something is, and that's the reason why I drove down here.

221
00:15:57,508 --> 00:16:07,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I want, I believe in East Boston, they're not only given new windows to homeowners, but they're also given insulation.

222
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:18,637
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not sure who I so-called the eyes is and what kind of clout they have on a mass port scene.

223
00:16:20,107 --> 00:16:24,448
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe at least we can get that to try to lessen the noise damage.

224
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:25,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for listening.

225
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:26,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

226
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:31,070
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion for approval, uh, seconded, uh, all those, uh, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

227
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:43,514
[SPEAKER_02]: With the request of the mayor's office to meet with the council, uh, in an emergency meeting on this subject matter as amended by councilor marks.

228
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:47,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

229
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:47,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

230
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight?

231
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:50,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

232
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:51,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

233
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:52,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

234
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks?

235
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:53,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

236
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:54,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

237
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:55,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

238
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:56,506
[SPEAKER_03]: President De La Ruza?

239
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:56,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

240
00:16:56,906 --> 00:17:03,891
[SPEAKER_02]: With a vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion carries.

241
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:05,793
[SPEAKER_02]: 16-742 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

242
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:19,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the speeding on South Street and request that the administration install speed humps to deter the heavy speeding of cars and trucks in the interest of public safety.

243
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:20,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Vice President.

244
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

245
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:29,155
[SPEAKER_06]: This subject, too, came up at least once in the last three months with regards to South Street.

246
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:35,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like every week we have an issue on one or two streets, depending on where we get in the complaints that coming week.

247
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:37,762
[SPEAKER_06]: The speeding is an issue.

248
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:46,408
[SPEAKER_06]: South Street, I've received a number of complaints with regards to the speeding, not only of cars, but also of heavy trucking.

249
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:48,750
[SPEAKER_06]: And trucking is coming down.

250
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:51,493
[SPEAKER_06]: banging manholes, waking people up.

251
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:59,996
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a real problem, and it's something that I think we need to either get some enforcement or some speed bumps.

252
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:07,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe we can necessarily do race crosswalks on all these streets, but we need to do something to deter the traffic, the speeding.

253
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,741
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming from Winthrop Street, buzzing around the corner there, and just flying.

254
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:18,464
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a straight shoot, and we're talking 40, 50 plus miles per hour, a number of cars all the time.

255
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:24,948
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many people that cross, at least, especially Walnut and South, somebody's going to get hurt.

256
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:41,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could ask that the chief of police put some enforcement in that location, and we also ask for an update from, I believe there was supposed to be a potential island put in, anything to deter the traffic.

257
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:43,273
[SPEAKER_06]: This is another location.

258
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,091
[SPEAKER_06]: that really need some help.

259
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:48,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we're doing whatever we can in different locations in Medford.

260
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:51,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Alston and High is getting some work done.

261
00:18:51,954 --> 00:19:00,036
[SPEAKER_06]: This is another location that, like Highland Ave, like South Street, Main Street, one of our main drags that is creating a serious safety risk.

262
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:09,479
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really hope that we can request speed bumps on South Street as a council and deterrent, just a deterrent for the speeding.

263
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, councilor.

264
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:17,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I know citizen is going to bring the matter before the traffic commission, uh, uh, in the near future chair recognizes councilor night.

265
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:19,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

266
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:25,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I believe that the construction project that the council was referring to was not on a traffic Island.

267
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:36,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was determined that it was going to be a curb bump out, would extend the curb at Winthrop and South street, um, further into the street so that vehicles can't come down Winthrop street at a high rate of speed going towards the parkway.

268
00:19:36,923 --> 00:19:38,844
[SPEAKER_11]: and continue down South Street at a high rate of speed.

269
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:52,512
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, too, would like to request, Mr. President, by way of amendment and update on that construction project, 1021, I sent an email to Deputy Director Curran for that exact same purpose, Mr. President.

270
00:19:53,472 --> 00:20:01,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I'd like to request that a traffic division provide directed patrols in the area during the rush hour hours, Mr. President.

271
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:05,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's safe to say that a lot of this traffic is a direct result of the

272
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:14,192
[SPEAKER_11]: that's being placed on route 16, that's taking cars out of Medford Square and bringing them down the parkway, then up Winthrop Street, then back down High Street into Medford Square.

273
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:21,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you can go that way, you can also take a left onto Winthrop Street and then a left onto South Street and go down South Street and get into Medford Square that way as well, Mr. President.

274
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:32,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'd also like to ask if the Massachusetts Department of Transportation can provide us with some mitigation help here, Mr. President, maybe in the way of a traffic count or a traffic study or helping fund

275
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,771
[SPEAKER_11]: temporary speed bumps in the location.

276
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:45,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Mr. President, back in April of 2014, I believe the council did support a community improvement initiative which authorized the purchase of two mobile speed bumps.

277
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,524
[SPEAKER_11]: One of those mobile speed bumps was placed out on central for quite a bit of time, and then it was removed.

278
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:55,309
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that was part of the pilot program that Councilor Marks championed for raised crosswalks, Mr. President.

279
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:58,372
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd also like to request that in the interim until a

280
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:06,872
[SPEAKER_11]: permanent solution can be made that the portable crosswalks that were, that funds are appropriate for an April of 2014, um, be installed on South street for the time being.

281
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:11,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, with that, with the directed patrols, I think we'll have an immediate impact on the quality of life in the neighborhood.

282
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:13,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

283
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:13,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor.

284
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:16,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

285
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:16,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

286
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

287
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:19,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Deborah Welch.

288
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:21,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at one Oh two South street.

289
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:26,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I had three pages of notes here and you just went over two and a half pages of my notes.

290
00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:27,989
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I appreciate that so much.

291
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:38,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to share that last Tuesday, I did come to this meeting, but last Tuesday before the council meeting, I had another opportunity to speak with Officer Brooks in traffic.

292
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:46,607
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just interesting to me how each person that I speak to in different departments within the city are already aware of the speeding issue on South Street.

293
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:50,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Officer Brooks mentioned the department has a traffic counter.

294
00:21:51,128 --> 00:21:55,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And the counter, it counts the number of vehicles, the number of axles, and the time and speed of the vehicles.

295
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:59,087
[SPEAKER_04]: which is currently out on a street in Medford.

296
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:04,611
[SPEAKER_04]: After this street, it goes to Adams Street, then West Street, and then he said it would come onto South Street.

297
00:22:06,372 --> 00:22:09,854
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just wanted to update that that was the information I had.

298
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:24,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Also today, there were men on the street marking it out from National Grid, the Greater Boston and New Hampshire Solution, and they were just marking out certain areas, and they are consultants for the Mystic to Woburn Line project.

299
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,653
[SPEAKER_04]: for, yes, for running underground cables.

300
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:32,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm glad, so you know about that, okay.

301
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:47,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just wondering, since they have to dig up the street, South Street being one of them, to run those, then possibly the city could piggyback on that road resurfacing and put the humps in at that time, or actually even to put it into their contract.

302
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:48,938
[SPEAKER_04]: that they had to do it.

303
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:53,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bumps are very different from the humps that you would put in the street.

304
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,440
[SPEAKER_04]: The bumps are much wider.

305
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,340
[SPEAKER_04]: They need a drain.

306
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,020
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very expensive, I've been told.

307
00:22:58,661 --> 00:22:59,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you would know that.

308
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:04,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And the humps are in a series, and they're smaller.

309
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:06,482
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like the humps that are in the

310
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:12,986
[SPEAKER_04]: in front of stop in the Fellsway, right, in front of stop and shop, and there are a series of them.

311
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:22,670
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason that there's a series of them is because it maintains the slowing of the speed rather than you slow down to go over a hump and then you just speed up after you're 10 feet past it.

312
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:33,375
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have a series of them, and with the four or five streets that you have off of South Street, if you put them either before or after the streets, then that would prevent the trucks, the cars from hitting

313
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:40,046
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, any pockets in the street that make the loud noises and the trucks from speeding down the entire street.

314
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:49,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not really about catching them, you know, during a certain time of the day, because it happens all hours of the night, all hours.

315
00:23:49,335 --> 00:23:51,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in the summertime, it wakes you up.

316
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:53,839
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just no relief from that in the summertime.

317
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And the size of the trucks, that's another issue.

318
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,017
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the size of the trucks that are allowed on Winthrop Street?

319
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:03,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And because Winthrop is the only feed into South Street.

320
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are the size of the trucks that are allowed?

321
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:10,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you saw the size of trucks that are coming down the street, I don't think that would be allowed.

322
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,846
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is, I appreciate that.

323
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:20,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only other thing I have to say is about, as far as the street humps go, there are only three materials that are used for that.

324
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:21,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And the city already has it.

325
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It's asphalt,

326
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:31,861
[SPEAKER_04]: signage, just alerting them to bumps or, you know, having one of those sticks up there like you do on a fire hydrant, and bright yellow spray paint.

327
00:24:32,482 --> 00:24:33,842
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just three materials.

328
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:35,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you for your time.

329
00:24:35,722 --> 00:24:36,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

330
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:38,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

331
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:40,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, Ms.

332
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:42,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Welch mentioned something that made me think.

333
00:24:43,663 --> 00:24:53,045
[SPEAKER_11]: As we look at South Street and its location, and then we look at right across the river, we have the Fellsway, and the Fellsway is part of our parkway system, and no trucking is allowed on

334
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,647
[SPEAKER_11]: on the Fellsway, on Route 16.

335
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:03,592
[SPEAKER_11]: And I see no difference between Route 16 and the same exact street, South Street, directly across the street, Mr. President.

336
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:10,537
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to amend the paper and request that the Traffic Commission take a look at the feasibility of making that a no-truck route.

337
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:14,980
[SPEAKER_11]: No heavy trucking.

338
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,421
[SPEAKER_02]: No heavy trucking on South Street.

339
00:25:19,322 --> 00:25:20,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Vice President.

340
00:25:20,528 --> 00:25:22,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to second that, President Dello Russo.

341
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:31,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe I've been getting the trucking complaints on South Street for the last couple of years since we did no heavy trucking on Harvard.

342
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:39,205
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think you're getting the trucks that can't go on Harvard or don't think they can go on Harvard coming down South now.

343
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:41,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think maybe that's where the overflow is coming from.

344
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:47,432
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think making South Street no heavy trucking is a good idea and something that

345
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,335
[SPEAKER_06]: almost the residents need as, as part of their relief.

346
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:51,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

347
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:58,099
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of vice-president Lungo-Koehn as seconded and amended by councilor Knight, councilor Marks.

348
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

349
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:12,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was council Lungo-Koehn that asked during the budget time that the city purchase more of the electronic speed signs because one of them was not properly working.

350
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:14,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm hearing that,

351
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:17,733
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one counter for the entire city.

352
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:30,402
[SPEAKER_09]: We have hundreds and hundreds of roads and we have one counter and there's a list of streets and your street may get put on the list at some point to have the traffic.

353
00:26:30,682 --> 00:26:37,327
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to me an invaluable resource to have this particular device count the traffic.

354
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:45,013
[SPEAKER_09]: It also gives a pretty accurate estimate of the speed cars are going so you can get a great picture

355
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:47,068
[SPEAKER_09]: of what's happening on a road.

356
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:59,196
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask, as part of this report, that the administration look into purchasing another counter or possibly two counters for the use of our traffic division.

357
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:07,682
[SPEAKER_09]: The second point, Mr. President, and as Councilor Knight mentioned, there's a major difference.

358
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:11,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realize what you're trying to do with traffic calming.

359
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:14,507
[SPEAKER_09]: You're trying to slow down cars on South Street.

360
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:19,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I am adamantly opposed to any type of speed bump.

361
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:23,870
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a reason, not because I don't like speed bumps.

362
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:25,912
[SPEAKER_09]: They may work in the parking lot.

363
00:27:25,932 --> 00:27:29,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I live across from the stop and shop, and they're effective in that parking lot.

364
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:37,782
[SPEAKER_09]: On streets, let me tell you, if you were to put several speed bumps on South Street, you'd be woken up all times of the night.

365
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:46,152
[SPEAKER_09]: with cars going over that, because just like you're stating with a raised crosswalk, they tend not to slow down.

366
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:54,158
[SPEAKER_09]: A speed bump is the same thing, and they're going to fly over the speed bump, and you're going to have trucks that are just going to be bouncing off those speed bumps.

367
00:27:55,018 --> 00:28:07,887
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, strategically located raised crosswalks, they're more expensive, but that's what's done in Cambridge, Somerville, Boston, and they're very effective in slowing down traffic, especially if they're properly marked,

368
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:13,698
[SPEAKER_09]: The one on Winthrop Street, we've had a fight to get marked and so forth, the paint on and so forth.

369
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:28,235
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are a lot of other traffic calming approaches of widening sidewalks, of putting 3D markers painted on the street that look like there's an interruption in the street and cars will slow down.

370
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:38,552
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a number of approaches that can be done that I think speed bumps, I think if you did install them, you'll be asking us to remove them immediately.

371
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:42,174
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just not effective on main roads.

372
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:43,594
[SPEAKER_09]: They just don't work.

373
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:44,835
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why you don't see them.

374
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:45,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to any other community.

375
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:54,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Malden ripped up the few that they had because there were a number of accidents caused by the speed bumps and cars trying to stop and going over too fast.

376
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:06,012
[SPEAKER_09]: it was my hope with the pilot program, with the raised crosswalks, which now is on year three or four, we were promised three.

377
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:06,853
[SPEAKER_09]: We only got one.

378
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:19,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so it was my hope that eventually after, uh, reviewing these raised crosswalks that would start putting throughout the community in areas that we know we need and South street would be one.

379
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:21,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree.

380
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:23,959
[SPEAKER_09]: South street's a long street, cars pick up a speed.

381
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:40,858
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we had a traffic engineer like Councilor Falco has been asking for here at City Hall, we'd be able to strategically locate these raised crosswalks in an area that would, in effect, probably slow down traffic throughout the entire South Street area.

382
00:29:41,578 --> 00:29:43,118
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was my hope.

383
00:29:43,638 --> 00:29:53,001
[SPEAKER_09]: But in my opinion, this city does very little when it comes to pedestrian safety, when it comes to enforcement in the community, and I'm hoping that

384
00:29:53,478 --> 00:30:04,566
[SPEAKER_09]: with this new administration that the mayor maintained some of the commitments that the past mayor had, one being the crosswalks, the raised crosswalks.

385
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,347
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a commitment from Mayor McGlynn.

386
00:30:06,747 --> 00:30:15,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor McGlynn also promised that crosswalks throughout the city would also get neon pedestrian crossing signs on each side of the street.

387
00:30:16,434 --> 00:30:22,518
[SPEAKER_09]: And when McGlynn left office, the new administration offered a resolution, I think it was last week,

388
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:23,896
[SPEAKER_09]: did not pick up on that.

389
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:30,879
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm hoping that becomes part of the overall process of moving this city forward.

390
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,020
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can appreciate South Street.

391
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,061
[SPEAKER_09]: We've talked about Brianna knows that her parents live on South Street.

392
00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:39,363
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been talking about South Street since I've been on the council.

393
00:30:40,223 --> 00:30:47,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know why we as a community can't offer some of these traffic calming approaches, sensible ones.

394
00:30:48,887 --> 00:30:50,028
[SPEAKER_09]: It just doesn't make sense to me.

395
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:54,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Your mic's not on.

396
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:00,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

397
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:00,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

398
00:31:00,836 --> 00:31:01,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

399
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:05,179
[SPEAKER_04]: It was also mentioned earlier that there might be an island.

400
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:12,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I had spoken with, at DPW, Mr. Teneglia, who had told me that he had seen plans for an island.

401
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:16,690
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't know where they are right now, but he said he has seen plans for an island.

402
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:21,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was also mentioned about the extended sidewalk, so the sidewalks would come out.

403
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:28,429
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think anything in the beginning, because if you're taking a right-hand turn onto South Street, it says blind driveway.

404
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:30,672
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a sign that says blind driveway, which means

405
00:31:31,194 --> 00:31:37,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, as it was last week, there was another place in Medford that there was a fence up that it's blind, that you can't get by it.

406
00:31:37,835 --> 00:31:40,936
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a blind turn onto South Street.

407
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:43,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And literally, I mean, they just fly by.

408
00:31:44,157 --> 00:31:45,557
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't know when they're coming.

409
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:47,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, trying to cross the street, whatever.

410
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:49,818
[SPEAKER_04]: You have people playing softball.

411
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:51,078
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the little kids coming.

412
00:31:51,178 --> 00:31:54,419
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the parents are parking there so they can go over to the park.

413
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's dangerous.

414
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:58,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seriously a danger zone.

415
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I would ask that the beginning of the street really be looked at.

416
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:10,884
[SPEAKER_04]: How to slow down that traffic coming around the corners and then continuing down the street.

417
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:11,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

418
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:12,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

419
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:12,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

420
00:32:13,444 --> 00:32:14,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

421
00:32:15,085 --> 00:32:20,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I just want to thank Councilor Longo-Curran for bringing this forward.

422
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:21,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a very important resolution.

423
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I can identify 100% with going to

424
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:28,448
[SPEAKER_05]: take my kids to Little League at the park.

425
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:29,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dangerous area.

426
00:32:29,689 --> 00:32:31,050
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dangerous intersection.

427
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:43,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And I support the resolution, especially the update on what was supposed to happen with the island or making the sidewalks wider in that area to help narrow the streets.

428
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:48,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you walk down South Street, I think especially on the side towards the river, there isn't even a sidewalk there.

429
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:49,922
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just grass.

430
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:55,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, it'd be nice to actually, maybe we could have a sidewalk created to actually help narrow that road.

431
00:32:56,528 --> 00:33:07,835
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really think you hear something like this here, and more and more, and I think all councilors have received these phone calls and emails, traffic, speeding.

432
00:33:08,776 --> 00:33:15,680
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about heavy trucking and how you eliminate it from one street, but it creates problems on another street.

433
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:21,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And issues like this here scream for a traffic engineer and hiring a traffic engineer.

434
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:24,546
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not have one on staff in the city.

435
00:33:25,828 --> 00:33:29,529
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no one qualified to study traffic in this city.

436
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:32,029
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no one qualified at all to study traffic.

437
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:39,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need someone, we need someone desperately, like Council Box mentioned earlier, I had offered a resolution back in the spring.

438
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,531
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not included in the budget.

439
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:43,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's included in next year's budget.

440
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:44,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bring it up again.

441
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:55,073
[SPEAKER_05]: But we desperately need a traffic engineer to look at issues like this, because these issues are just, with more and more development coming into our city, these issues

442
00:33:55,486 --> 00:34:05,174
[SPEAKER_05]: are just becoming, they are popping up all over our neighborhoods, throughout our city, they need to be addressed, and I feel like in many ways they're not being addressed because we don't have a traffic engineer.

443
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:08,556
[SPEAKER_05]: So I support the resolution and move approval.

444
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:23,308
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilors Knight, Falco, and Marx.

445
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:26,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair recognizes Vice President Margaret Curran.

446
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Just briefly, if we could also just further amend it.

447
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:42,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I think with the amount of speeding complaints we're getting and the questions we have for the chief of police, if we could set up a committee of the whole meeting to just discuss with the mayor and the chief of police what else we can do.

448
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:48,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great that we have the complete streets grant that's coming and we're going to improve a number of different locations in the city.

449
00:34:49,736 --> 00:34:53,697
[SPEAKER_06]: that's only going to do so much for a small amount of streets.

450
00:34:53,837 --> 00:35:00,619
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to create a better plan on how we can enforce our streets with regards to the speeding in a better manner.

451
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we're doing a good enough job.

452
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:16,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think something needs to be done, whether we need to put more police officers on, get more speed monitors, figure out how many are trained to enforce speeding.

453
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:18,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I know traffic counters are involved.

454
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:23,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And people are now starting to not only complain about the speeding, but to ask us these questions.

455
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't know the answers.

456
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:27,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know we only had one traffic counter.

457
00:35:27,974 --> 00:35:31,657
[SPEAKER_06]: We learned in budget time that we only had one speed monitor sign that's broken.

458
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:33,138
[SPEAKER_06]: We've asked for a second one.

459
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:34,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe they're being purchased.

460
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,522
[SPEAKER_06]: But we don't know the facts and figures.

461
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:46,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't know the constraints of our police department and what we need to do to make sure we boost levels in the enforcement of traffic.

462
00:35:46,872 --> 00:35:50,875
[SPEAKER_06]: because people are getting hit, people are getting hurt, and we need to do something in this community.

463
00:35:50,915 --> 00:36:01,741
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to step up to the plate, all get to the table, and decide how we can proceed in a way that's going to make our streets safer for the children, for the elderly, for anybody who's crossing the street at any given moment.

464
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:03,903
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to make sure we're doing a better job.

465
00:36:05,544 --> 00:36:06,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

466
00:36:07,185 --> 00:36:07,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

467
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

468
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:16,571
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it was — the recommendation was made some four or five years ago

469
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:22,193
[SPEAKER_09]: that we merged the off-street parking commission with the traffic commission.

470
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:27,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was done recently, as of, I think, about a year and a half ago.

471
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Both commissions were merged.

472
00:36:31,184 --> 00:36:35,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's probably about time, as we know, this city is growing.

473
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:43,389
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, not in land wise, but, uh, population wise and housing wise.

474
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:49,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, the need for increased public safety is evident now more than ever.

475
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:53,852
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, you know, and this is no slight on anyone.

476
00:36:54,332 --> 00:37:00,814
[SPEAKER_09]: So if anyone takes it that way, I'm sorry, but the traffic commission right now consists of the chief of police.

477
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:04,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, he's running a very busy department.

478
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,246
[SPEAKER_09]: So he sits on the traffic commission.

479
00:37:06,786 --> 00:37:09,708
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the director of office community development.

480
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:11,790
[SPEAKER_09]: She sits on the traffic commission.

481
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:18,254
[SPEAKER_09]: She's running a very busy community development office, uh, trying to bring in new business throughout this community.

482
00:37:18,742 --> 00:37:27,747
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the head of the DPW, the DPW commissioner, sits on the traffic commission, very busy running the DPW department.

483
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:38,113
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're saying, well, now you'll sit on this committee and maybe years in the past, you get together for an hour or two and discuss some issues, vote on some issues and then go home.

484
00:37:38,474 --> 00:37:39,094
[SPEAKER_09]: But guess what?

485
00:37:39,694 --> 00:37:46,098
[SPEAKER_09]: In this day and age, I think that job involves much more, Mr. President, much more time and effort.

486
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:54,417
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe it's about time we as a community review the Traffic Commission and bring it up to the 21st century, Mr. President.

487
00:37:55,017 --> 00:37:59,220
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we're talking about a traffic engineer.

488
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the Traffic Commission doesn't have any engineer they can go to either.

489
00:38:03,963 --> 00:38:11,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So when someone presents an issue to them, they don't have the knowledge and whereabouts to go to a traffic engineer and say,

490
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:13,284
[SPEAKER_09]: How would this work there?

491
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:14,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this suitable?

492
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:15,165
[SPEAKER_09]: And so forth.

493
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:23,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think at some point, maybe when we do meet, I know Councilor Longo asked, and I think it was Councilor Knight, that we meet with the administration and so forth.

494
00:38:24,946 --> 00:38:32,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we have to have that discussion, Mr. President, regarding the Traffic Commission and how we can improve the Traffic Commission.

495
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:47,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week we found out that the mayor appointed the Complete Streets Committee to also be part of, which is separate from the Traffic Commission, be part of pedestrian safety initiatives in this community.

496
00:38:48,517 --> 00:39:06,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe, as I recommended, I think it was last week or the week before, that we come up with truly a citizen advisory board, Mr. President, that sits down and not only makes recommendations, but has teeth to do enforcement when it comes to making sure that things happen.

497
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:17,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Because right now, the Traffic Commission can approve it, but they can only approve it until the DPW goes out and hangs the signs, or paints the crosswalks, or do their job.

498
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:24,705
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe we need one body that has both the legislative ability and the enforcement ability to get things done.

499
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:27,287
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is an important issue.

500
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:31,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, Mr. President, we're creating bike lanes in this community.

501
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a lot happening.

502
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:37,233
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a major cut through into the city of Boston

503
00:39:38,102 --> 00:39:47,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're just not doing enough to make sure our streets are safe and pedestrians feel safe to walk around our city, Mr. President.

504
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:53,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask, was that offered in the form of a motion that we meet with the traffic?

505
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:56,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to steal someone's thunder if someone offered it.

506
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,728
[SPEAKER_09]: It was an amendment to the main motion.

507
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:00,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that an amendment?

508
00:40:00,668 --> 00:40:00,968
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

509
00:40:01,008 --> 00:40:05,490
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that's an amendment made already, then I support that whole item, Mr. President.

510
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor.

511
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:10,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

512
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Please state your name and address for the record.

513
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:12,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome sir.

514
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

515
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew Cushman street.

516
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:20,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh two one five five on the subject of safety and sell street.

517
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:29,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be remiss not to repeat myself at the last police crime watch meeting that transpired in West method last month.

518
00:40:31,123 --> 00:40:36,707
[SPEAKER_07]: So chief Sacco and the offices and the people that were attended,

519
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:45,397
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to me the most dangerous intersection in the whole city is at South Street.

520
00:40:46,018 --> 00:41:05,532
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not sure where you're speaking of, but if you continue down South Street, heading east, and you come to the end, as you're approaching the police academy and the police station in front of you, and you're entering onto Main Street, in my opinion, it's the most accident prone,

521
00:41:07,193 --> 00:41:13,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's even documented intersection in the entire city, even beats Wellington, Winthrop circle.

522
00:41:14,396 --> 00:41:17,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been dealing with sub method for over 40 something years.

523
00:41:20,218 --> 00:41:34,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So by recommendation, not being in a safety professional would be as you enter main street, it's right turn only council max.

524
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:43,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate Mr. Castagnetti bringing that up because this council has offered a number of initiatives regarding lights, blinking lights.

525
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:50,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were always told that because that's an entrance to a state highway, that that is state property at the end.

526
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:59,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, I believe it was about a year and a half ago, two years ago when the department of transportation came before this council to answer some questions on

527
00:41:59,573 --> 00:42:01,715
[SPEAKER_09]: the rehabbing of the Craddock Bridge.

528
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:03,116
[SPEAKER_09]: We said, you know what?

529
00:42:03,136 --> 00:42:04,358
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be right in the area.

530
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,360
[SPEAKER_09]: You're doing over the Craddock Bridge.

531
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not another 25 yards up the street?

532
00:42:10,684 --> 00:42:13,907
[SPEAKER_09]: We know we have a major concern with Salton Main.

533
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:19,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time, I'll never forget it, the person at the podium said, that's not part of the scope of the project.

534
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,840
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would have been a great time, in my opinion, to address the needs.

535
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:32,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're literally, it's like, you know, putting a roof on your house and then, you know, not leaving the windows open.

536
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:33,903
[SPEAKER_09]: It just doesn't make any sense.

537
00:42:35,363 --> 00:42:48,627
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, we can ask that through our state delegation, State Rep Donato and Senator Jayler and Representative Barber to help us get involved in improving

538
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,250
[SPEAKER_09]: of that particular intersection.

539
00:42:50,431 --> 00:42:51,791
[SPEAKER_09]: It's right across from the police station.

540
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:57,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know.

541
00:42:58,294 --> 00:43:10,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, and then, Councilor Marks brought up a point that I recollect exactly that session and the answer, you seem 100% accurate to my recollection.

542
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:11,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

543
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you for jumping on this because it's

544
00:43:16,812 --> 00:43:19,073
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more than an incredibly dangerous intersection.

545
00:43:19,113 --> 00:43:23,355
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be the worst in Andrew's book, period, in the whole city.

546
00:43:24,655 --> 00:43:36,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So Route 38, which is Mystic Ave, no, it's Mystic Ave, I believe, and Main Street has no number.

547
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think that's a state road.

548
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:39,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Mystic Ave is not there.

549
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:43,023
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't start until after the fire station, I believe.

550
00:43:43,863 --> 00:43:45,884
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe South Street also is

551
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:53,110
[SPEAKER_07]: a city road, even though it's sort of like an exit off route 16.

552
00:43:54,390 --> 00:44:02,273
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we don't have to deal with no state to put up a rights, right turn only coming off, coming off south onto main.

553
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:03,614
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many access.

554
00:44:03,654 --> 00:44:06,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I can attest from my own blood having situations there.

555
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:12,077
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a right turn only, that means they cannot take a left into Medford square where a lot of accidents happened.

556
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:19,022
[SPEAKER_07]: because they don't stop at the stop sign properly, or they do, and it's just called accidents.

557
00:44:21,143 --> 00:44:27,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and you cannot go straight, the way I'm speaking, because if you wanted to go straight, well, you could have stayed on 16.

558
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:31,988
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's coming off 16, right?

559
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:38,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You take the right turn only, yeah, okay, now you end up at the fork of Mystic Ave and Main Street.

560
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:41,512
[SPEAKER_07]: When you make your U-turn around Mystic Ave,

561
00:44:44,205 --> 00:44:46,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Fire stations, parking lot, because it's a law.

562
00:44:46,245 --> 00:44:47,386
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't go in there and turn.

563
00:44:47,866 --> 00:44:50,046
[SPEAKER_07]: But when there's a will, there's a way.

564
00:44:50,426 --> 00:44:58,668
[SPEAKER_07]: We can eliminate lots of misery, hardship, hopefully a lot of people end up in wheelchairs, and more people going to the funeral homes.

565
00:44:59,168 --> 00:44:59,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for listening.

566
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:05,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry?

567
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:09,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion, as amended,

568
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:19,078
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Knight, and as amended by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, Councilors Knight, Marks, and Falco.

569
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:20,438
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

570
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:22,299
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

571
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:23,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion carries.

572
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Paper in the hand of the clerk, offered by Councilor Marks.

573
00:45:29,741 --> 00:45:36,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the land and building located on Maple Park Avenue, known as the Hegner Center, be discussed.

574
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:39,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks, as I'm sure you know,

575
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:44,936
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and are proud to announce it has been returned to the care of the city for $1.

576
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:47,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

577
00:45:48,176 --> 00:45:58,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, back in 1991, uh, the city of Medford transferred the property located at 15 Maple Park Ave, uh, to the Heckner Center for $1.

578
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:07,840
[SPEAKER_09]: The Heckner Center, uh, is a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation, uh, which services individuals with intellectual disabilities.

579
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:13,513
[SPEAKER_09]: The deed from the city to the Heckner Center contained a provision.

580
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:23,656
[SPEAKER_09]: And the provision stated, in the event the premise shall no longer be used for non-profit educational purposes, the premise shall revert to the city of Medford.

581
00:46:25,176 --> 00:46:25,716
[SPEAKER_09]: On October 31st, 2007,

582
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,003
[SPEAKER_09]: The Heckner Center merged with a corporation called Bridgewell.

583
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:43,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Bridgewell also provides individuals with disabilities and their families services to assist them with rehabilitative and educational treatment services.

584
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:55,177
[SPEAKER_09]: It was back in November of 2013 that Bridgewell outgrew 15 Maple Park Drive, better known as the Heckner Center,

585
00:46:55,885 --> 00:47:02,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And in November of 2013, they relocated and left the building altogether.

586
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:16,781
[SPEAKER_09]: So for over two years, that building sat vacant and it was not being used for its intended purpose, which was spelled out in the deed for nonprofit educational purposes.

587
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:25,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And at that point, the city should have known that that building should have reverted back to the city.

588
00:47:26,419 --> 00:47:37,007
[SPEAKER_09]: And for whatever reason, the city wasn't notified or the city wasn't doing their due diligence and the building was just left unattended.

589
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:54,159
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was sometime after, I believe it was in 2015, that Bridgewell entered and explored an option to sell the property.

590
00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:00,573
[SPEAKER_09]: to Ministerio, which is, I believe, a church, which is a non-profit church.

591
00:48:01,534 --> 00:48:12,239
[SPEAKER_09]: And they entered into a purchase and sale agreement to have Ministerio purchase the property at 15 Maple Park Drive for $650,000.

592
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about a windfall.

593
00:48:16,802 --> 00:48:22,185
[SPEAKER_09]: They got it for a dollar from the city, and they're entering into an agreement to sell it for $650,000.

594
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:23,942
[SPEAKER_09]: $50,000.

595
00:48:23,259 --> 00:48:23,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Now in March,

596
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:56,991
[SPEAKER_09]: 2016, March 10th, this council received paper 16-310 from the mayor's office, Mayor Burke, and as part of the paper, the mayor asked for the council to approve some language changes to the deed itself, and I believe there were five different language changes to the deed, and also stated

597
00:48:57,637 --> 00:49:20,745
[SPEAKER_09]: The purpose of this communication is to inform you that the city, Bridgewell, and Ministerio have entered into a tentative agreement under which the city will receive $125,000 from the proceeds of the sale of 15 Maple Park Ave to resolve any issues arising out of Bridgewell's non-use of the property.

598
00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:25,587
[SPEAKER_09]: And I assume it's since November 2013 when they left the building.

599
00:49:27,624 --> 00:49:31,687
[SPEAKER_09]: So at that time, the mayor approached the council through a paper to this council.

600
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:50,603
[SPEAKER_09]: This council in their wisdom said, wait a minute, Madam Mayor, we may agree on some things and may disagree on others, but it didn't make sense at the time for this council to vote on a building that was owned by the city,

601
00:49:51,725 --> 00:50:01,696
[SPEAKER_09]: was deeded over for a particular purpose of non-profit disability and rehab usage to now allow that building to be sold.

602
00:50:03,999 --> 00:50:07,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And the council stood up, seven councillors,

603
00:50:08,077 --> 00:50:09,398
[SPEAKER_09]: stood up and said, you know what?

604
00:50:09,418 --> 00:50:25,446
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember Mr. Rumley was here at the time and said, we want the city to reestablish ownership based on Bridgewell's failure to provide notification of its departure from that property in 2013.

605
00:50:27,513 --> 00:50:34,876
[SPEAKER_09]: So based on them leaving, based on the deed that said that it should revert back to the city, this council took the stand.

606
00:50:35,396 --> 00:50:40,138
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Rumley went back with that notice from this council.

607
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure he went back to the mayor.

608
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:45,560
[SPEAKER_09]: And he started to negotiate with Bridgewell.

609
00:50:46,901 --> 00:50:49,222
[SPEAKER_09]: On March 22, 2016, Councilor Caraviello offered a resolution.

610
00:50:53,078 --> 00:51:03,005
[SPEAKER_09]: that the property revert back to the city and that it also be used for other purposes and possibly turn the building into an art center and so forth.

611
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:13,313
[SPEAKER_09]: On September 27th, as most recent, I offered a resolution asking Mr. Rumley for an update because we haven't heard anything in months.

612
00:51:14,253 --> 00:51:17,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Today we received a press release.

613
00:51:17,415 --> 00:51:20,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I received one via email from the administration.

614
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:22,427
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was great.

615
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:26,988
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a picture of the mayor with, I assume, a representative from Bridgewell.

616
00:51:27,568 --> 00:51:37,710
[SPEAKER_09]: And the mayor's holding a copy of the new deed and a dollar bill that's attached to the deed, showing that Bridgewell sold it back to the city.

617
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:46,252
[SPEAKER_09]: And the mayor wanted to congratulate all parties, except for the Medford City Council, who started this.

618
00:51:47,212 --> 00:51:48,933
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the mayor's prerogative.

619
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:51,213
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor can thank whoever she wants.

620
00:51:52,125 --> 00:52:06,616
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my opinion, Mr. President, if it wasn't for this council and this council standing up and saying, you know what, Madam Mayor, you may think that's the right thing, but we don't feel that's the right thing on behalf of the taxpayers of this community.

621
00:52:07,256 --> 00:52:14,181
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't feel a property assessed at over $650,000 that we receive $125,000, in my opinion, payoff, is not the right thing to do, Mr. President.

622
00:52:22,027 --> 00:52:25,069
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to thank each and every one of my colleagues.

623
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:26,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you.

624
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:34,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Longo, Councilor Knight, Councilor Falco, and Councilor Caraviello.

625
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,192
[SPEAKER_09]: for the leadership, Mr. President, on this issue.

626
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:42,176
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm proud to say that building is reverting back to the city.

627
00:52:42,896 --> 00:52:54,025
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm proud to say, Mr. President, whether we resell it or whether we use it for another purpose, like maybe an art center of the community, or maybe having Method Arts Council have a home

628
00:52:54,385 --> 00:52:55,765
[SPEAKER_09]: that they don't currently have a home.

629
00:52:56,105 --> 00:53:02,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe we can put a recreation department in there that Councilor Scarpelli is the chairman of and leading that effort.

630
00:53:03,107 --> 00:53:05,667
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot of need in this community, Mr. President.

631
00:53:06,107 --> 00:53:10,588
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am ecstatic that we were able to get this building back.

632
00:53:11,028 --> 00:53:17,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Mr. Rumley, because he's the one that negotiated the deal with Bridgewell.

633
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:21,190
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to personally thank Mr. Rumley for his efforts on this.

634
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:22,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And again,

635
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,972
[SPEAKER_09]: thank the council for their leadership, Mr. President.

636
00:53:25,032 --> 00:53:25,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

637
00:53:25,992 --> 00:53:27,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilman.

638
00:53:31,036 --> 00:53:33,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

639
00:53:33,437 --> 00:53:33,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

640
00:53:34,338 --> 00:53:36,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

641
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:40,842
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Zagos party.

642
00:53:40,922 --> 00:53:46,926
[SPEAKER_10]: I, too, would like to commend this council for doing the right thing when this issue was presented before you.

643
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:50,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And likewise, I'd like to thank Mark Rumley.

644
00:53:50,409 --> 00:53:52,110
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a city solicitor.

645
00:53:52,393 --> 00:53:54,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Umley, for doing the work.

646
00:53:54,855 --> 00:54:00,980
[SPEAKER_10]: But the disturbing part about this whole presentation is the fact that the deed originally had its right of reverter.

647
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:15,632
[SPEAKER_10]: And the right of reverter reverts back to the community if, in fact, the building was not going to be used for the particular purpose for which it was intended, its non-profit use, and that would be helping children and adults that had serious problems.

648
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:27,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Putting that aside, the building sat there for almost two years and the city did nothing to recognize not only was the building not being used, but the fact of the matter is it wasn't being used for its intended purpose.

649
00:54:28,494 --> 00:54:46,020
[SPEAKER_10]: I just find it appalling that the mayor of this community would take it upon herself and send out a press release and not even thank you, the Councilors, because if it wasn't for you, the Councilors, asking Councilor Rumley to do the research, to prove and to show that that building did belong to the city,

650
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:50,634
[SPEAKER_10]: for a future particular city use, it's just a shame.

651
00:54:51,114 --> 00:54:54,397
[SPEAKER_10]: It's another example of this lack of transparency.

652
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,860
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know what it's going to take for this council to wake up and to understand.

653
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:01,890
[SPEAKER_10]: You people are just being used, you're like a ping pong ball bouncing back.

654
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:04,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Only when you need it, that's when you're called upon.

655
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:13,940
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when you finally do something, and it didn't even help any one Councilor in particular, you were doing this for the entire community, the community as a whole.

656
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,342
[SPEAKER_10]: And you don't even get a special thank you.

657
00:55:16,602 --> 00:55:18,023
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't even get an acknowledgement.

658
00:55:18,223 --> 00:55:20,505
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't even get a reference by any commentary.

659
00:55:20,925 --> 00:55:25,369
[SPEAKER_10]: But the mayor sends out a press release commending herself for completing this.

660
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:26,530
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a shame.

661
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:31,035
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know what it's going to take for this council to realize that you do have a voice.

662
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:33,377
[SPEAKER_10]: You do are, you do, you are important.

663
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:44,788
[SPEAKER_10]: And had not this council taken that seven to nothing vote to send it to Mr. Rumbling, but rather had the seven of you decided just to vote for it on that particular night, we wouldn't be where we are today.

664
00:55:45,249 --> 00:55:46,330
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'd be out of a building.

665
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:48,172
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd be out of the use of the building.

666
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:52,971
[SPEAKER_10]: and you'd look like very stupid individuals because nobody did their homework.

667
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:57,272
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank you, I commend you, I applaud you, and I thank Mr. Rumley as well.

668
00:55:57,592 --> 00:55:57,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

669
00:55:58,692 --> 00:55:59,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, citizen.

670
00:56:01,273 --> 00:56:05,233
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Marks that the City Council is congratulated.

671
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:06,534
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

672
00:56:07,854 --> 00:56:08,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And receive accommodation.

673
00:56:08,974 --> 00:56:10,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And receive accommodation.

674
00:56:10,114 --> 00:56:11,035
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

675
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:12,355
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

676
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:13,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion carries.

677
00:56:13,755 --> 00:56:14,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Bid resolved.

678
00:56:14,795 --> 00:56:17,556
[SPEAKER_02]: This is offered in the hand of the clerk by Councilor Knight.

679
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:22,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the city administration provide an update on the status of resolution 16-404.

680
00:56:23,335 --> 00:56:24,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

681
00:56:25,456 --> 00:56:26,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

682
00:56:26,898 --> 00:56:43,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Resolution 16-404 was a resolution that I filed some months back requesting a list of all the roadways and sidewalks that were dug up or permitted for excavation by our public utilities, Mr. President, and the status thereof, whether or not they've been completed to the city of Medford standards or not.

683
00:56:44,299 --> 00:56:50,822
[SPEAKER_11]: as well as a request for a list of properties that have received permits where the restoration work has not been completed.

684
00:56:51,703 --> 00:57:00,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, as many of us are aware, in situations where trees wrap around power lines, the utility is responsible for pruning back the trees that are wrapped up in utility lines.

685
00:57:00,627 --> 00:57:07,010
[SPEAKER_11]: And I asked for a list of locations that the utilities are responsible for in terms of trees growing into power lines, Mr. President.

686
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:11,972
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a growing concern about the amount of construction work that's going on in our community here.

687
00:57:12,535 --> 00:57:14,196
[SPEAKER_11]: that's being performed by public utilities.

688
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:24,483
[SPEAKER_11]: If you were going to drive down through the Lawrence Estates, for example, you'd see Trancroft and Crocker Road dug up for 15, 20, 30, 40 feet, Mr. President.

689
00:57:25,204 --> 00:57:30,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we get down to the corner of Governor's Ave and Forest Street, and we see some more excavation work being done there.

690
00:57:30,828 --> 00:57:33,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you look across the street on Ashcroft, and there's work being done there, Mr. President.

691
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:37,752
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a tremendous amount of trench work being done by our public utilities.

692
00:57:37,873 --> 00:57:41,375
[SPEAKER_11]: But, quite frankly, I don't have the warm and fuzzies when it comes down to the

693
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:43,695
[SPEAKER_11]: restoration work that's being done, Mr. President.

694
00:57:43,715 --> 00:57:49,277
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm asking the engineering department to give us a list of these properties and locations, Mr. President.

695
00:57:50,017 --> 00:57:56,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Once I receive the list, I'd like to take a review and then potentially create some criteria to mandate requirements in the permitting process.

696
00:57:56,478 --> 00:58:01,440
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, if the utility comes in to do emergency work, that a fire detail be present.

697
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:11,322
[SPEAKER_11]: If the utility comes in to work on a roadway like Lawrence Road or like Forest Street, that they have to have a police detail present and a traffic management plan in place that's actually going to make sense and work, Mr. President.

698
00:58:12,545 --> 00:58:19,429
[SPEAKER_11]: As we see our roads get dug up more and more frequently, we see detours and we see traffic getting routed through neighborhoods and through residential streets.

699
00:58:19,469 --> 00:58:25,393
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really a quality of life issue, Mr. President, between the traffic when the work is going on and then the shoddy repair work at the end of the job.

700
00:58:25,713 --> 00:58:27,574
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's something that we need to take a focus on.

701
00:58:28,194 --> 00:58:30,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd ask for the council to support this resolution.

702
00:58:31,536 --> 00:58:35,118
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

703
00:58:35,938 --> 00:58:36,679
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

704
00:58:37,988 --> 00:58:38,748
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

705
00:58:39,288 --> 00:58:39,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion carries.

706
00:58:40,709 --> 00:58:41,869
[SPEAKER_02]: The records of the meeting.

707
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we call for the records, Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

708
00:58:47,631 --> 00:58:55,413
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could just ask that the crosswalk in front of the Seafood Depot in West Medford Square be painted in the interest of public safety.

709
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:57,254
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion.

710
00:58:57,774 --> 00:58:58,694
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

711
00:58:59,475 --> 00:59:00,255
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

712
00:59:00,695 --> 00:59:01,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

713
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And do we have any report of the Committee of the Whole?

714
00:59:04,556 --> 00:59:05,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we reported something out.

715
00:59:06,237 --> 00:59:07,297
[SPEAKER_09]: We have yet to receive that.

716
00:59:08,526 --> 00:59:15,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

717
00:59:15,391 --> 00:59:17,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair Agnes, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

718
00:59:17,412 --> 00:59:22,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a brief acknowledgement to the Chamber of Commerce.

719
00:59:22,276 --> 00:59:29,060
[SPEAKER_06]: They branched off, Kelly Catalo and Janet Donnelly ran a women's networking event tonight at Salvatore's restaurant.

720
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to congratulate them.

721
00:59:30,301 --> 00:59:34,464
[SPEAKER_06]: They had almost 40, 50 women there networking.

722
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:36,806
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a nice event and I told them I'd give them a shout out.

723
00:59:36,866 --> 00:59:38,027
[SPEAKER_06]: It went really well.

724
00:59:38,665 --> 00:59:42,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank Denise Baker from Sal's who donated all the pizza.

725
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:43,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Yum.

00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:43,270
